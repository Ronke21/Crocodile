<text>was a town located in the Higashimatsuura District of Saga Prefecture, Japan. Ōchi is also romanized as Ouchi and is often referred to that way in Japan. Ōchi was founded as Ōchi-mura (Ōchi-village) by the amalgamation of 16 smaller villages in 1889. It became Ōchi-town (Ōchi-chō) in 1935. Ōchi thus had its own town hall. 

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 8,890 and a density of 136.60 persons per km². The total area was 65.08 km².

On January 1, 2005, Ōchi, along with the towns of Chinzei, Hamatama, Hizen, Kyūragi and Yobuko, and the village of Kitahata (all from Higashimatsuura District), were merged into the expanded city of Karatsu. The old town hall became the Ōchi branch office of Karatsu City Hall.

Ōchi contains the Memorial Hall of Hideo Murata who was a famous Japanese rōkyoku and enka singer. A major attraction are the Udonoiwaya Buddhist rock carvings. The scores of images of Buddha date from as early as the 7th century. Also popular is the nearby Mikaerinotaki (Looking Back Waterfall). The Warabino terraced rice fields, said to be the highest in Japan, are located on the northern slopes of Mount Hachimandake in Ōchi.

A major event is the harvest festival, the Ōchi-kunchi. This is a smaller version of the famous Karatsu Kunchi. Beginning on the 3rd Friday of October each year the town has a weekend in which there are a series of parades, day and night, where children and adults pull two large floats and dress in period costumes with much music and lively chanting.

Ōchi was coal mining town before World War II. These days the mine site has been transformed into Ōchi park, the Saga Royal golf course, and a sports complex. Ōchi has become something of a bedroom community, with considerable new housing developments on the north side of the Kyuragi river. 

The main train station, Ōchi Station (相知駅), is on the Karatsu Line of Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu) running from Nishi-Karatsu Station in Karatsu to Kubota Station in Saga. A smaller line, part of the Chikuhi Line, runs from Yamamoto Station of Karatsu City, through Nishi-Ōchi Station (West-Ōchi) to Imari Station in Imari City, a notable pottery centre in Saga Prefecture, along with Karatsu and Arita. The next station south from Nishi-Ōchi is Sari Station.

Ōchi has become home to the new 21 MW Saga Ouchi Solar farm just southwest of Oshigawa in southeast Ōchi. The solar farm is one of the biggest in Kyushu and opened in April 2018.

<doc id="469430" wikidata="Q2891089" url="?curid=469430" title="Meir Har-Zion">
<text>Meir Har-Zion (; February 25, 1934 – March 14, 2014) was an Israeli military commando.

As a key member of Unit 101, he was highly praised by Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan who described him as &quot;the finest of our commando soldiers, the best soldier ever to emerge in the IDF&quot;. Ariel Sharon described him as &quot;the elite of the elite.&quot; His three-year military career (1954–56) was cut short by injuries sustained in battle, but he joined in again during the 1967 and 1973 wars. The character of Ari Ben-Canaan in Leon Uris&#x27;s bestselling novel &quot;Exodus&quot; is generally believed to have been based on Har-Zion.

==Early life==
Har-Zion was born in Herzliya in 1934, and was a third generation sabra. His mother, Sarah Goldenberg, had been born in Rishon LeZion to a mother who had been born in Jerusalem to a Sephardi-Jewish family originally from İzmir and a father who had been born in Romania and moved to Palestine with his parents as a child. Har-Zion&#x27;s father, Eliyahu Horowitz, had moved to Palestine from Russia.

When Har-Zion was three years old, the family moved to Rishpon, where his two sisters Shoshana and Rachel were born. When he was 14, his parents divorced, and Har-Zion moved to kibbutz Ein Harod with his father while his mother and sisters moved to kibbutz Beit Alfa. As a child, Har-Zion spent much of his free time watching nature and taking walks, sometimes crossing the borders of Palestine. 

In 1951, he and Shoshana were captured by a shepherd while on the Syrian side of the border. They were held prisoner in Damascus, and the two teenagers were only released by the Syrian government after a month of negotiation by the UN and the governments of both countries, making international headlines.

Being the children of divorced parents, Meir and his younger sister Shoshana had developed a deep emotional bond with each other, and had become extremely close, often illegally crossing into neighbouring Arab countries together.

During the 1950s around a dozen Israeli teenagers were killed attempting to illegally reach the ancient city of Petra, which is located 40 km inside Jordan. Such cross-border treks were considered a rite of passage for elite youth. The song &quot;HaSela HaAdom&quot; (The Red Rock), which praised a group killed attempting the trek, was banned.

At the age of 18, Meir and his girlfriend managed to reach Petra at night, after three days of hiking, crossing Wadi Musa, climbing Mount Hor and bypassing an impassable waterfall. They apparently slipped into the ancient city unnoticed, under cover of darkness, before exploring the Nabatean vestiges. This feat made them legendary figures amongst the Israeli youth of the time, for whom Petra represented an unreachable citadel. &quot;We had only a compass and a map on a small scale, but that was definitely enough to find our way to Petra,&quot; Har-Zion recalled.

== Unit 101 ==

In 1953 he was one of the founding members of Unit 101. He took part in the unit&#x27;s first operation at the end of August 1953. Sixteen men with two jeeps, two command cars, and a reconnaissance aircraft attacked the &#x27;Azazme Bedouin camps around the wells at al Auja. Their tents were burnt and anyone attempting to reach the well was shot at.

On the night of 14–15 October 1953, around 65 men from Unit 101 joined a larger IDF force in an attack on the village of Qibya, in what became known as the Qibya massacre. Har-Zion commanded one of three squads sent to ambush any reinforcements coming from Ni&#x27;lin, Budrus, and Shuqba.

In another nighttime attack on 18–19 December 1953, two Unit 101 squads led by Har-Zion ambushed a car on the Bethlehem-Hebron road. Mansour Awad, a Lebanese-born physician serving in the Arab Legion, was killed. Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Sharett was annoyed that he had not been informed about the attack beforehand. Three nights later. Har-Zion led a four-man squad on a 21-kilometre march to the outskirts of Hebron.

Other missions that Har-Zion took part in included Operation Black Arrow and Operation Elkayam.

== 890th Paratroop Battalion ==
The following year, 26 May 1954, Har-Zion was amongst a ten-man squad from the newly formed 890th Paratroop Battalion, led by its commander Ariel Sharon, which carried out a raid near Khirbet Jinba, southwest of Hebron. Two National Guardsmen were killed in an ambush as well as two farmers and two camels. Sharett once again complained about not having been informed, and suspected that Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon had not been consulted either.

On 27–28 June 1954 Har-Zion was in a seven-man squad led by Major Aharon Davidi that launched a surprise attack on an Arab Legion camp at Azzun, 13 km east of Qalqilya. Three Legionnaires were killed as well as a farmer, Rafi&#x27;a Abdel Aziz Omar, who was stabbed to death by Har-Zion to prevent him raising the alarm. On their return to Israeli lines, one of the team who had been wounded, Sergeant Yitzhak Jibli, was left behind. On discovering that Sergeant Jibli had been taken prisoner, Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan approved a series of hostage-taking raids.

On 31 July – 1 August 1954 Har-Zion led a group of ten raiders who attacked two police near Jenin, taking one of them prisoner. On their way back, they killed a farmer watching his fields. On the 30–31 August 1954 Har-Zion took part in Operation Binyamin 2. This operation was approved by Prime Minister Moshe Sharett and was commanded by Ariel Sharon. The attackers were divided into four groups. The first attacked a school in the village of Beit Liqya. The other three set ambushes for the expected arrival of reinforcements. Only Har-Zion&#x27;s group was successful. They had strung a wire across the road with cans of petrol at each end. A car full of soldiers from the Arab Legion drove into the trap. Two were killed, one wounded, and three were taken prisoner.

Sergeant Yitzhak Jibli was released on 29 October 1954, four months after being wounded and captured.

== The Har-Zion Affair ==

In the middle of February 1955 Har-Zion&#x27;s sister, Shoshana, along with her boyfriend Oded Wegmeister from Degania Bet, both 18, were captured, abused, and murdered by Bedouin tribesmen from Wadi al-Ghar (the central section of the stream called in Hebrew &quot;Nahal Arugot&quot;, which ends at Ein Gedi) while on an illegal cross-border hike across the Judean desert on Jordanian territory. When he heard of her death, Har-Zion was inconsolable and vowed revenge. On March 4, he and three ex-members of the 890th Battalion drove to the Armistice Line with Jordan. In Wadi al-Ghar, 9 km from the border, they captured six Bedouin from the Jahaleen and &#x27;Azazme tribes. The prisoners were interrogated and five of them killed, four with knives, and the fifth was shot. One of the dead was 16 years old. The sixth was sent back to his tribe to tell what happened. The men probably had nothing to do with the killing of Har-Zion&#x27;s sister, and had merely belonged to the same tribes as the murderers. David Ben-Gurion told the cabinet that the Israelis did not know enough Arabic to understand what their prisoners were saying. Sharon wrote that it was &quot;the kind of ritual revenge the Bedouins understood perfectly. But the repercussions of what Har-Zion had done were very 20th century. The Jordanians made a formal complaint to the UN.&quot;

On their return, Har-Zion and three of his companions were held in custody for 20 days. They were released without charge, as a result of protection and stonewalling by them and their colleagues in the army, and soon rejoined their old unit. Sharett, who suspected that Dayan had advance knowledge of the raid, and who deplored such actions, noted critically in his diary: &quot;The dark soul of the Bible has come alive among the sons of Nahalal and &#x27;Ein Harod&quot;.

==End of career==
, 11–12 September 1956, was a retaliatory attack by two paratroop companies on Khirbet ar-Rahwa police fort, on the Hebron–Beersheba road, in which over 20 Jordanian soldiers and police were killed. During the fighting, Har-Zion was wounded in the throat and arm. His life was saved by an army physician who performed a tracheotomy using his pocket-knife while still under fire.

The injuries left Har-Zion unable to continue his army career. He was awarded the Medal of Courage. He had attained the rank of captain.

==1967 and 1973 wars==
During the 1967 Six-Day War, Har-Zion was called up as captain in the reserves, and despite the use of only one hand, took part alongside the paratroopers in the battle for the Old City of Jerusalem. In one important exploit in the battle, he killed a Jordanian sniper who had been holding up the Israeli advance: after stalking the sniper across a rooftop, he killed him with hand-grenades.

Har-Zion served again as a captain during the Yom Kippur War, on the Golan front, rescuing injured soldiers behind enemy lines.

== Writing career ==

In 1969 he published his diaries which gave an account of his time as a paratrooper.

Of one of the early attacks he wrote:
He also gives an account of the killing of farmer Rafi&#x27;a Abdel Aziz Omar during the 27–28 June 1954 operation (details see above):
== Late life and death ==

During the latter part of his life he lived in Ahuzat Shoshana &quot;Shoshana&#x27;s Farm&quot;, a 6,500-dunam farm built on a hilltop of Kawkab al-Hawa (, &quot;Mount of the Spirits&quot;) within the Issachar Plateau above the Jordan Valley, just north and in sight of kibbutz Beit Alfa, right next to the ruins of the Crusader&#x27;s Belvoir Fortress within the Belvoir National Park (Kochav haYarden Park). The farm is named after his sister and her name is written on the gate to the farm. Har-Zion was married and had four children. 

He became a right-wing writer and patron to movements such as Homesh First. In 2005, in an interview he criticized his former colleague Ariel Sharon for his policy of disengagement from Gaza Strip.

Har-Zion died on March 14, 2014, from natural causes at the age of 80 at his farm.

Har-Zion was buried at Kochav Hayarden park. His funeral was attended by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Shimon Peres, Defense Minister Moshe Ya&#x27;alon, and other ministers and dignitaries.

<text>is a town located in Higashimatsuura District, Saga Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 4,910 in 1918 households, and a population density of 240 persons per km2. The total area of the city is . There was a town with the same name in Fukuoka Prefecture, but it now no longer exists.

==Geography==
Genkai is located on the northwestern edge of the prefecture on the Higashimatsuura Peninsula and faces the Genkai Sea on its west side. It is located about 50 km (31 mi) northwest of the city of Saga and about west of Fukuoka. Genkai is home to one of sixteen nuclear power plants in Japan, with the only other nuclear power plant in the Kyūshū area being located in Kagoshima Prefecture. It is the only town in the Higashimatsuura District of Saga that has not merged with Karatsu.

===Adjoining municipalities===
Saga Prefecture
*Karatsu

===Climate===
Genkai has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Genkai is 16.8 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1764 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 27.1 °C, and lowest in January, at around 7.2 °C.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Genkai is as shown below.

==History==
The area of Genkai was part of ancient Hizen Province. During the Edo period, the area was part of Karatsu Domain. Following the Meiji restoration, the villages of Chika and Ariura, were established with the creation of the modern municipalities system. The two villages merged on September 30, 1956 to form the town of Genkai. On December 31, 1957 the neighborhoods of Sosorogawachi, Yunoo, Fujihira, Tashiro from the village of Kirigo were incorporated into Genkai. Kirigo&#x27;s remaining neighborhoods are incorporated into Karatsu.

===The great Heisei merger===
All other towns and villages from Higashimatsuura District were incorporated into Karatsu between 2005 and 2006. Genkai originally planned to merge into Karatsu with the rest of the district, but was concerned about the slow administrative response of the surrounding areas. Eventually they withdrew their decision to merge and decided to continue as an autonomous municipality.

==Government==
Genkai has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of ten members. Genzai, collectively with the city of Karatsu, contributes six members to the Saga Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of the Saga 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
Genkai is now enjoying a relatively high amount of revenue from the Genkai Nuclear Power Plant, built in 1975, but there is a question as to its administration in the future. There is also some agriculture, notably the cultivation of strawberries, and commercial fishing.

==Education==
Genkai has one public combined elementary/junior high school operated by the city government. Opened on April 1, 2015, the school had 498 students from grades 1 - 9 across 19 classes and 6 special needs classes. There is also one public high school operated by the Saga Prefectural Board of Education.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Genkai does not have any passenger railway service. The nearest train station is Nishikaratsu Station on the JR Kyushu Karatsu Line. A bus route runs from the station to Genkai.

==Early life==
Smith was born on 27 November 1954 in Bermondsey, south London. His eldest brother is Richard Smith, a medical doctor, editor and businessman. His younger brother is Nick Smith, a civil servant who was also a stand-up comic but in recent years has turned to amateur dramatics.

He then studied at the University of East Anglia, where he was chairman of the poetry society, wrote for the student newspaper and contributed sketches for a student revue. He graduated with a 2:1 BA degree in Comparative literature in 1976.

==Career==

Smith was one of many stand-up performers on the alternative comedy scene in the 1980s, and still performs today in much the same manner. He has regularly attended the Edinburgh Fringe comedy festival since 1977, and still comperes the long-running Hackney Empire New Act of the Year competition final. He has also written a body of serious or semi-serious work, including stage plays such as &quot;An Evening with Gary Lineker&quot;.

In addition to stand-up comedy, Smith has performed musical comedy shows such as &quot;Arthur Smith Sings Leonard Cohen&quot; (later broadcast on Radio 4). He returned to this theme for the Edinburgh Fringe in 2013 with &quot;Arthur Smith Sings Leonard Cohen (Volume Too). He is also a radio presenter on such BBC Radio 4 programmes as &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; and &quot;Loose Ends&quot;, and appears on television comedy panel games. He took over as narrator of the TV series &quot;A Life of Grime&quot; after the death of John Peel and was one of the &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; in the television series of that name. Both of the latter two series used &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; as their theme song. For &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot;, Smith was one of the cast members who contributed to a montage rendition of the song.

One of Smith&#x27;s routines has been set to music by Mark Beazley, aka Rothko, for a CD curated by comedian and writer Stewart Lee. The CD, &quot;The Topography of Chance&quot; was guest-curated by Stewart for the Sonic Arts Network and Smith&#x27;s track is called &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen Your Arse&quot; and contained extra vocals by Caroline Quentin taken from a live recording of Smith&#x27;s show, &quot;Arthur Smith&#x27;s Last Hangover&quot;.

In December 1985, Smith and Phil Nice made a short series of parody documentaries for Channel 4 television network called &quot;Arthur and Phil Go Off&quot;. One episode, titled &quot;Nessie – Real or Pretend&quot; about the Loch Ness Monster, was aired in America on the A&amp;E cable channel in 1986. None of these shows has officially been released to any video format.

During the late 1980s, Smith took the role of consumer expert, testing such items as hangover cures and Pot Noodles on the BBC Radio 2 &quot;Nightcap&quot; show hosted by Peter Dickson.

In 1989, Smith provided voices for an Aardman Animations short called &quot;Ident&quot; with Nice and later. In 1989 he appeared in &quot;The Bill&quot; (&quot;Quiet Life&quot;). In the mid and late 1990s, he lent his voice to some television animations including the TV short &quot;The Animal Train&quot; as Jim Jam (veteran voice actor Rick Jones voiced the character in the US version), the BBC clay animated series &quot;Rex the Runt&quot; (also made by Aardman) as Arthur Dustcart in five episodes, and the British-French children&#x27;s animated series &quot;Romuald the Reindeer&quot; as the big bully Clint.

One of Smith&#x27;s more unusual roles was in the sitcom &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; in the episode &quot;Backwards&quot;. He plays a bar manager on backwards Earth who has hired Kryten and Rimmer as a forward novelty act. He gave a speech (in reverse) blaming Kryten and Rimmer for starting a fight. If, however, the speech is played forwards, he is heard to be insulting the listener who has flipped the recording over trying to find out what he was saying (&quot;What a poor sad life &quot;he&#x27;s&quot; got&quot;).
A night of watching football with Tony Hawks ended with him challenging Hawks to beat the entire Moldovan football team at tennis. Hawks took him up on this bet, and wrote a book about it. Hawks won the bet, and Smith had to stand on Balham High Road and sing the Moldovan National Anthem whilst naked.
Smith also appeared in a cameo role in the first series of the BBC science fiction radio comedy &quot;Married&quot;. He played a version of himself from a parallel universe who eked out a living as a children&#x27;s party entertainer. This role expanded in the second and third series.

In 2006, Smith played &quot;Clarrie&quot; in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio, &quot;The Kingmaker&quot;.

He is currently one of the hosts of &quot;The Comedy Club&quot; on BBC Radio 4 Extra and also narrates the BBC series &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;. He makes a cameo appearance in the music video of the song &quot;Happy Goddamn Christmas&quot;, by Loretta Maine and Matt Roper, released on 13 December 2012 via BBC Three.

In August 2016, he appeared in the role of Mr Harman in the revival of the BBC sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served&quot;.

Debrett&#x27;s lists his full books and publication list as &quot;Trench Kiss&quot; (1990), &quot;An Evening With Gary Lineker&quot; (with Chris England, 1992), &quot;Pointless Hoax&quot; (1997), &quot;Sit-Down Comedy&quot; (2003), &quot;That Which Is Not Said&quot; (poetry, 2006), and &quot;My Name is Daphne Fairfax&quot; (autobiography, 2009).

==Awards==
In 2005, Smith turned down a lifetime-achievement award from the Perrier Award organisers. He said: &quot;Comedians rather dislike the Perrier Awards and the public aren&#x27;t interested. Basically, they wanted to tell me I was old and cool: well, I know that already, and anyway, my ego is bloated enough.&quot; In 2007, he went on to win the Panel Prize at the Edinburgh Fringe.

==Personal life==
Smith has been a longtime resident of Du Cane Court in Balham, London, and has described himself as the &quot;Night Mayor of Balham – I don&#x27;t do days&quot;. In 2009, he broadcast a comedy series for BBC Radio 4 from his own home, &quot;Arthur Smith&#x27;s Balham Bash&quot;.

As of 2009 he was engaged to Beth Kilcoyne, a performer and screenwriter, who co-wrote the BBC TV series &quot;Roger &amp; Val Have Just Got In&quot;.

Smith is a socialist and a supporter of the Labour Party.

<text>USS &quot;Bolinas&quot; (CVE-36) (originally AVG-36, then later ACV-36) was an escort carrier launched 11 November 1942 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding, Tacoma, Washington; sponsored by Mrs. G. B. Sherwood, wife of Commander Sherwood; and commissioned 22 July 1943, Captain H. L. Meadow in command.

==Design and description==
These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by a steam turbine, two boilers connected to one shaft giving 9,350 brake horsepower (SHP), which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

==Service history==
On 2 August 1943 after being decommissioned &quot;Bolinas&quot; was transferred to the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease and renamed HMS &quot;Begum&quot; (D38). &quot;Begum&quot; served with the Royal Navy during World War II, doing anti-submarine sweeps in the Indian Ocean with 832 Squadron as her complement, participating in the sinking of the .

&quot;Begum&quot; ferried the following RN squadrons to the Far East April 1944:

1839: 10 F6F disembarked Madras 14 April

1844: 10 F6F disembarked Madras 14 April

815: 12 Barracuda II disembarked Madras 14 April

817: 12 Barracuda II disembarked Madras 14 April

After her return she was declared surplus by the U. S. Navy. She was stricken for disposal 19 June 1946 and sold by the Navy into merchant service 16 April 1947 as &quot;Raki&quot; and later &quot;I Yung&quot;. She was scrapped in Taiwan in March 1974.

<doc id="469470" wikidata="Q439046" url="?curid=469470" title="Sylvia Earle">
<text>Sylvia Alice Earle (born August 30, 1935) is an American marine biologist, oceanographer, explorer, author, and lecturer. She has been a National Geographic Explorer at Large (formerly Explorer in Residence) since 1998. Earle was the first female chief scientist of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and was named by &quot;Time Magazine&quot; as its first Hero for the Planet in 1998.

Earle is part of the group Ocean Elders, which is dedicated to protecting the ocean and its wildlife.

Earle gained a large amount of publicity when she was featured in &quot;Seaspiracy&quot; (2021), a Netflix Original documentary by British filmmaker Ali Tabrizi.

Earle eats a vegetarian diet. She describes the chemical buildup in carnivorous fish, the 90% depletion of populations of large fish, and references the health of oceans in her dietary decision. Also, she describes the seafood industry as &quot;factory ships vacuuming up fish and everything else in their path. That&#x27;s like using bulldozers to kill songbirds…&quot;.

In a discussion at the Good Food Conference in California, Earle warns of disappearing fish stocks, and that while coastal people&#x27;s diets have included seafood for centuries, the commercial fishing industry no longer makes sense. She encourages transitions to plant-based diets as a solution.

==Early life and education==

Earle was born in 1935 in the Gibbstown section of Greenwich Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey, to Alice Freas (Richie) Earle and Lewis Reade Earle. Both her parents were enthusiastic about the outdoors and supportive of their daughter&#x27;s early interests in the natural world. The family moved to Dunedin on the western coast of Florida during Earle&#x27;s childhood. Earle received an associate degree from St. Petersburg Jr. College (1952), a Bachelor of Science degree from Florida State University (1955), a Master of Science (1956) and a Doctorate of Phycology (1966) from Duke University.

Sylvia Earle life work has been shaped directly by Rachel Carson, whose talent she rhapsodizes about in the Introduction to the 2018 edition of Carson&#x27;s 1951 best-seller, &quot;The Sea Around Us&quot;.

&quot;Most remarkable to me is what she did imagine. Her writings are so sensitive to the feelings of fish, birds and other animals that she could put herself in their place, buoyed by the air or by water, gliding over and under the ocean’s surface. She conveyed the sense that she was the living ocean…&quot;

==Career==
Earle was a Radcliffe Institute Scholar (1967–1969). Earle was a research fellow at Harvard University (1967–1981). After receiving her Ph.D. in 1966, Earle spent a year as a research fellow at Harvard, then returned to Florida as the resident director of the Cape Haze Marine Laboratory.

Earle was a research associate at the University of California, Berkeley (1969–1981). In 1969, she applied to join the Tektite Project, an installation fifty feet below the surface of the sea off the coast of the Virgin Islands which allowed scientists to live submersed in their area of study for up to several weeks. Although she had logged more than 1,000 research hours underwater, Earle was rejected from the program. The next year, she was selected to lead the first all-female team of aquanauts in Tektite II.

Earle was the Curator of Phycology at the California Academy of Sciences (1979–1986). In 1979, she made an open-ocean JIM suit dive, untethered, to the sea ocean floor near Oahu. She set the women&#x27;s depth record of which still holds to date. In 1979 she also began her tenure as the Curator of Phycology at the California Academy of Sciences, where she served until 1986.

From 1980 to 1984, she served on the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere.

In 1982 she and her later husband, Graham Hawkes, an engineer and submersible designer, founded Deep Ocean Engineering to design, operate, support and consult on piloted and robotic subsea systems. In 1985, the Deep Ocean Engineering team designed and built the &quot;Deep Rover&quot; research submarine, which operates down to . By 1986, &quot;Deep Rover&quot; had been tested and Earle joined the team conducting training off Lee Stocking Island in the Bahamas.

Earle left the company in 1990 to accept an appointment as Chief Scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, where she stayed until 1992. She was the first woman to hold that position. During this post, given her expertise on the impact of oil spills, Earle was called upon to lead several research trips during the Persian Gulf War in 1991 to determine the environmental damage caused by Iraq&#x27;s destruction of Kuwaiti oil wells.

In 1992, Earle founded Deep Ocean Exploration and Research (DOER Marine) to further advance marine engineering. The company, now run by Earle&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth, designs, builds, and operates equipment for deep-ocean environments.

In 1998, Earle received the title National Geographic Explorer in Residence and now holds the title &#x27;Explorer at Large&#x27;. She is sometimes called &quot;Her Deepness&quot; or &quot;The Sturgeon General&quot;.

From 1998 to 2002, she led the Sustainable Seas Expeditions, a five-year program sponsored by the National Geographic Society and funded by the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund to study the United States National Marine Sanctuary. During this time, Earle was a leader of the Sustainable Seas Expeditions, council chair for the Harte Research Institute for the Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi, and chair of the Advisory Council for the Ocean in Google Earth. She also provided the DeepWorker 2000 submersible used to quantify the species of fish as well as the space resources utilized within the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary.

In 2001, Earle received the National Parks Conservation Association&#x27;s Robin W. Winks Award For Enhancing Public Understanding of National Parks.

Earle founded Mission Blue (also known as the Sylvia Earle Alliance, Deep Search Foundation, and Deep Search) in 2009.

In 2009, she also received the 100k TED prize which allowed her to continue her ocean advocacy work.

Given her past experience with the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; and &quot;Mega Borg&quot; oil spills, Earle was called to consult during the Deepwater Horizon Disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. During this year she also gave a 14-minute speech in front of 3,500 delegates and United Nations ambassadors at The Hague International Model United Nations Conference.

In July 2012, Earle led an expedition to NOAA&#x27;s Aquarius underwater laboratory, located off Key Largo, Florida. The expedition, entitled &quot;Celebrating 50 Years of Living Beneath The Sea&quot;, commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of Jacques Cousteau&#x27;s Conshelf I project and investigated coral reefs and ocean health. Mark Patterson co-led the expedition with Earle. Their aquanaut team also included underwater filmmaker D.J. Roller and oceanographer M. Dale Stokes.

Earle made a cameo appearance in the daily cartoon strip Sherman&#x27;s Lagoon in the week starting September 17, 2012, to discuss the closing of the Aquarius Underwater Laboratory.

In May 2013, the Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013 (H.R. 1891; 113th Congress) was introduced into Congress. Earle was listed by one commentator as a possible nominee for the position of Science Laureate, if the act were to pass.

In January 2018, the Seattle Aquarium granted its inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award to Earle and renamed the Seattle Aquarium Medal in her honor. The Aquarium&#x27;s first Lifetime Achievement Award was awarded to Earle.

Alongside her work at Mission Blue, she also serves on several boards, including the Marine Conservation Institute.

With TED&#x27;s support, she launched Mission Blue, which aims to establish marine protected areas (dubbed &quot;Hope Spots&quot;) around the globe. Mission Blue&#x27;s vision is to achieve 30% protection of the ocean by 2030, and more than two hundred organisations have supported them in this mission to date (2019). These supporters range from large, global companies to small, bespoke research teams.

With Mission Blue and its partners, Earle leads expeditions to Hope Spots around the globe. The organization has continued to grow with Earle&#x27;s work and the help of her team. As of 2020, Mission Blue has created 122 Hope Spots around the world. Past expeditions include Cuba in 2009, Belize in January 2010, the Galápagos Islands in April 2010, Costa Rica and the Central American Dome in early 2014 and the South African Coast in late 2014. A series of geographic information StoryMaps are available through ESRI&#x27;s ArcGIS which illustrate examples of Mission Blue hope spots around the world in great detail including: 1 Tribugá Gulf Hope Spot, 2 Little Cayman Hope Spot, and 3 Galápagos National Park Expedition. In August 2014, a Netflix exclusive documentary titled &#x27;Mission Blue&#x27; was released. It focuses on Earle&#x27;s life and career as her Mission Blue campaign to create a global network of marine protected areas.

In 2016, Earle appeared in the featurette &quot;Plankton Rules the World!&quot;, which coincided with &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot;. The featurette was shown at the Arlington Theater in Santa Barbara.

In the 2019 article &quot;California Seamounts Are Sylvia Earle&#x27;s Newest &#x27;Hope Spots&#x27;&quot; featured in Hakai Magazine, Hope Spots are described as &quot;areas critical to the health of the ocean for any number of reasons: an abundance or diversity of species, a unique habitat or ecosystem, or significant cultural or economic value to a community&quot;. Seamounts are also described as destinations for mining companies in search of undersea precious metals.

In January 2020, Aurora Expeditions announced their second ship would be named &quot;The Sylvia Earle&quot; after the marine biologist.

Earle is one of the supporters of the 30X30 movement which aims to protect 30% of seawaters by 2030 and which would be a significant increase from only 6% (as of 2021).

She supports the introduction of the crime of ecocide to the International Criminal Court, stating, &quot;There is a real case to be made for recognising ecocide in the International Criminal Court right along with genocide. Our existence is on the line&quot;.

In June 2024, DENR Secretary Toni Yulo-Loyzaga convened a dialogue with Earle, Ambassador MaryKay Carlson and Senator Loren Legarda, inter alia, to advocate Philippine Marine Biodiversity Protection and Conservation. Earle, as token gifted Loyzaga with copy of her &quot;Ocean: A Global Odyssey&quot;. She dived in Verde Island Passage with DENR divers and marine scientists campaigning for its conservation as marine protected area. Her Mission Blue named the VIP as a &quot;Hope Spot&quot; in July 2023.

In June 2024, Earle was also announced as a member of the Advisory Board of Climate Cardinals, one of the world&#x27;s largest youth-led climate organizations.

<text>Slot 1 refers to the physical and electrical specification for the connector used by some of Intel&#x27;s microprocessors, including the Pentium Pro, Celeron, Pentium II and the Pentium III. Both single and dual processor configurations were implemented.

Intel reverted to the traditional socket interface with the release of Socket 370 in 1999.

== General ==
With the introduction of the Pentium II CPU, the need for greater access for testing had made the transition from socket to slot necessary. Previously with the Pentium Pro, Intel had combined processor and cache dies in the same Socket 8 package. These were connected by a full-speed bus, resulting in significant performance benefits. Unfortunately, this method required that the two components be bonded together early in the production process, before testing was possible. As a result, a single, tiny flaw in either die made it necessary to discard the entire assembly, causing low production yield and high cost.

Intel subsequently designed a circuit board where the CPU and cache remained closely integrated, but were mounted on a printed circuit board, called a Single-Edged Contact Cartridge (SECC). The CPU and cache could be tested separately, before final assembly into a package, reducing cost and making the CPU more attractive to markets other than that of high-end servers. These cards could also be easily plugged into a Slot 1, thereby eliminating the chance for pins of a typical CPU to be bent or broken when installing in a socket.

The form factor used for Slot 1 was a 5-inch-long, 242-contact edge connector named SC242. To prevent the cartridge from being inserted the wrong way, the slot was keyed to allow installation in only one direction. The SC242 was later used for AMD&#x27;s Slot A as well, and while the two slots were identical mechanically, they were electrically incompatible. To discourage Slot A users from trying to install a Slot 1 CPU, the connector was rotated 180 degrees on Slot A motherboards. This also allowed motherboard manufacturers to save costs by stocking the same part for both Slot 1 and Slot A assemblies.

With the new Slot 1, Intel added support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP). A maximum of two Pentium II or Pentium III CPUs can be used in a dual slot motherboard. The Celeron does not have official SMP support.

There are also converter cards, known as Slotkets, which hold a Socket 8 so that a Pentium Pro CPU can be used with Slot 1 motherboards. These specific converters, however, are rare. Another kind of slotket allows using a Socket 370 CPU in a Slot 1. These are generally more common than Socket 8 to Slot 1 slotkets. Many of these latter devices are equipped with their own voltage regulator modules, in order to supply the new CPU with a lower core voltage, which the motherboard would not otherwise allow.

== Form factors ==


The Single Edge Contact Cartridge, or &quot;SECC&quot;, was used at the beginning of the Slot 1-era for Pentium II CPUs. Inside the cartridge, the CPU itself is enclosed in a hybrid plastic and metal case. The back of the housing is plastic and has several markings on it: the name, &quot;Pentium II&quot;; the Intel logo; a hologram; and the model number. The front consists of a black anodized aluminum plate, which is used to hold the CPU cooler. The SECC form is very solid, because the CPU itself is resting safely inside the case. As compared to socket-based CPUs, there are no pins that can be bent, and the CPU is less likely to be damaged by improper installation of a cooler.

Following SECC, the SEPP-form (Single Edge Processor Package) appeared on the market. It was designed for lower-priced Celeron CPUs. This form lacks a case entirely, consisting solely of the printed-circuit board holding the components.

A form factor called SECC2 was used for late Pentium II and Pentium III CPUs for Slot 1, which was created to accommodate the switch to flip chip packaging. Only the front plate was carried over, the coolers were now mounted straight to the PCB and exposed CPU die and are, as such, incompatible with SECC cartridges.

== History ==
Historically, there are three platforms for the Intel P6 CPUs: Socket 8, Slot 1 and Socket 370.

Slot 1 is a successor to Socket 8. While the Socket 8 CPUs (Pentium Pro) directly had the L2-cache embedded into the CPU, it is located (outside of the core) on a circuit board shared with the core itself. The exception is later Slot 1 CPUs with the Coppermine core which have the L2-cache embedded into the die.

In the beginning of 2000, around the time the Coppermine Pentium III CPUs with FC-PGA housing were already commonplace, Slot 1 was slowly succeeded by Socket 370, after Intel had already offered Socket 370 and Slot 1 CPUs at the same time since late 1998. Socket 370 was initially made for low-cost Celeron processors starting with the Mendocino Celerons, while Slot 1 was thought of as a platform for the more expensive Pentium II and early Pentium III models. Both cache and core were embedded into the die.

Slot 1 also obsoleted the old Socket 7, at least regarding Intel, as the standard platform for home users. After superseding the Intel P5 Pentium MMX CPU, Intel completely left the Socket 7 market.

<doc id="469477" wikidata="Q2064289" url="?curid=469477" title="1980 Quebec referendum">
<text>The 1980 Quebec independence referendum was the first referendum in Quebec on the place of Quebec within Canada and whether Quebec should pursue a path toward sovereignty. The referendum was called by Quebec&#x27;s Parti Québécois (PQ) government, which advocated secession from Canada.

The province-wide referendum took place on May 20, and the proposal to pursue secession was defeated by a 59.56 percent to 40.44 percent margin.

A second referendum on sovereignty, which was held in 1995, also rejected pursuing secession, albeit by a much smaller margin (50.58% to 49.42%).

== Background ==
Quebec, a province since Canadian Confederation in 1867, has always been the sole majority French-speaking province. Since Canada&#x27;s creation, tensions have existed between the French and English parts of the country. With English being the only national language until 1969, French Canadians in Quebec saw bilingualism as a “one-way road”, with French speakers expected to learn English to cater to Anglophones both in Quebec and the rest of the country. The Roman Catholic Church held power over everything from educational to welfare institutions in the province, with Quebec citizens having to pay tithe taxes to the Church.

As industrialization grew the size of the working middle class, power remained in the hands of English speakers. In Montreal, many mayors through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries did not speak French. This led to what The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science called &quot;a Montreal elite largely imported, overall Anglo-Saxon, and dominated by business matters&quot;. Across Quebec, business was conducted in English, with French speakers never controlling more than 20% of businesses throughout the 1900s. This constant subordination of French Canadians in Quebec led to the Quiet Revolution, characterized by the effective secularization of society and the creation of a welfare state (&quot;état-providence&quot;). It also caused a realignment of provincial politics into federalist and sovereigntist factions, the latter calling for the separation of Quebec from Canada and its establishment as a sovereign nation state.

A prominent sovereigntist was René Lévesque, who helped found the Parti Québécois (PQ) with like-minded separatists. The PQ proposed &quot;sovereignty-association&quot;, a proposal for Quebec to be a sovereign nation-state while requiring (hence the hyphen) an economic partnership with what remained of Canada. The PQ had intended to declare independence upon forming government, citing the principle of parliamentary supremacy. This was changed in the party platform after internal lobbying by Claude Morin to a referendum strategy to better allow such a declaration to be internationally recognized.

The PQ won the 1976 election in a surprise rout of the governing Quebec Liberals of Robert Bourassa on a general platform of good government and the promise of holding a referendum on sovereignty-association during their first term. In government, the PQ implemented a number of popular reforms to longstanding issues in the province, while emphasizing its nationalist credentials with laws such as Bill 101, which reinforced French as the province&#x27;s official language. The bill controls everything from street signs to education to internal business communications, and essentially gives everyone the right to live in Quebec without knowing English. While the bill was popular in French circles as it finally affirmed their language rights, it added to the tension in English communities. With anything English-only, even product labels, effectively banned, Bill 101 may have contributed to growing Anglophone migration out of Quebec, and one Anglophone paper at the time said Bill 101 made Quebec a “police state”.

The PQ&#x27;s efforts were in philosophical conflict with the federal Liberal government of Pierre Elliot Trudeau, an opponent of sovereignty who instead urged Quebecers to seek empowerment at the federal level through reforms that provided for bilingualism and protection for individual rights. Trudeau, an effective campaigner whose party had dominated federal politics in Quebec for over 80 years, was considered such a formidable opponent that Lévesque refused to implement a referendum while Trudeau remained in office.

In the 1979 federal election, the Liberals were narrowly defeated by the Progressive Conservatives led by Joe Clark, whose platform had included a more accommodating approach to constitutional negotiations with the provinces. Clark&#x27;s minority government made a point to not have the federal government be involved in the referendum, leaving the task of representing federalist voices to Claude Ryan, the new leader of the Quebec Liberal Party.

On June 21, 1979, Lévesque announced the promised referendum would occur in the spring of 1980, and that the question would be announced before Christmas.

== Leadup ==
On November 1, 1979, the Quebec government made public its constitutional proposal in a white paper entitled &quot;Québec-Canada: A New Deal. The Québec Government Proposal for a New Partnership Between Equals: Sovereignty-Association&quot;.

A dramatic change occurred in Ottawa on December 11, 1979, when a series of confused phone calls led the nationalist Social Credit Members of Parliament (MPs) to abstain from a budget vote, which, along with a concerted Liberal and New Democratic Party (NDP) push, led the Clark government to unexpectedly lose a vote of confidence on a budget bill, precipitating a federal election. Three days afterward, Trudeau announced his return as leader of the Liberals. Polls showed Clark losing handily.

== Question ==
The referendum question was a subject of much internal debate amongst the Parti Québécois caucus. &quot;Pur et durs&quot; such as Finance Minister Jacques Parizeau preferred a simple question on the entirety of the proposal. Lévesque came to the view that, as sovereignty-association would by necessity require negotiations with the Government of Canada, the government of Quebec should be treated as a legal agent and require ratification of its final decision. He also felt the safety of a second referendum would convince swing voters to back the &quot;Yes.&quot;

A significant debate arose as to whether a &quot;question&quot; under the &quot;Referendum Act&quot; could have more than one sentence: the final compromise was to use semicolons.

The question announced on December 20, 1979, was: &quot;The Government of Quebec has made public its proposal to negotiate a new agreement with the rest of Canada, based on the equality of nations; this agreement would enable Quebec to acquire the exclusive power to make its laws, levy its taxes and establish relations abroad — in other words, sovereignty — and at the same time to maintain with Canada an economic association including a common currency; any change in political status resulting from these negotiations will only be implemented with popular approval through another referendum; on these terms, do you give the Government of Quebec the mandate to negotiate the proposed agreement between Quebec and Canada?&quot;

Lévesque, while noting its cumbersome nature, stated that it was transparent and could be easily understood.

== Legislative debate==
The Liberals presented their constitutional proposal, known as the &quot;Beige Paper&quot; on January 10, 1980, which advocated a decentralized Canadian federation. While generally viewed as detailed and competent, the report did not make much impact on the federal election, and was attacked by the PQ as vague and insubstantial. Ryan, who disliked the federal Liberals, refused to endorse either Trudeau or Clark.

On February 18, 1980, the federal Liberals won a majority in the House of Commons, and Trudeau returned as Prime Minister. Trudeau announced Jean Chrétien, his most trusted lieutenant, as having responsibilities for the federal response to the referendum. Ryan was furious.

Television had recently been introduced to the Quebec National Assembly, and the legislative debate on the referendum question was scheduled for prime time live viewing on March 4, 1980. The debate lasted two weeks, and the result was a smashing PQ success and a disaster for the provincial Liberals. The PQ Cabinet, coordinated by House Leader Claude Charron, provided detailed outlines of their files and the benefits they said sovereignty would provide them. The Liberals provided quick and taunting retorts regarding the referendum question that would normally be heard on the legislative floor, but which appeared to be flippant and insubstantial compared to the lengthy and detailed speeches of PQ members to television viewers. The Liberals seemed to lack preparation and Ryan, unaware of the television cameras, was caught yawning on a few occasions during Liberal interventions. 

Polls released after the debates showed the Yes and No side roughly even, with a majority amongst Francophone voters for the &quot;Yes.&quot;

==&quot;Brunch des Yvettes&quot;==
Less helpful to the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign was a speech by the Minister of Consumer Affairs, Cooperatives and Financial Institutions Lise Payette to a committee in Montreal, which mocked what she viewed as the &quot;No&quot; side&#x27;s complacency by using the conception of &quot;Yvette&quot;, a docile schoolgirl from pre-Quiet Revolution schoolbooks, a general theme she had also used in the legislature. Payette then stated that Ryan wanted a Quebec full of &quot;Yvettes&quot; and that his wife, Madeline Ryan, was an Yvette. The personal attack prompted a furious editorial by prominent journalist Lise Bissonnette, who sarcastically contrasted Payette&#x27;s televised exploits with Mme Ryan&#x27;s accomplishments in the private and public sector.

Payette apologized during the legislative debate, but the remark and editorial sparked a movement. On March 30, a group of 1,700 women, including Madeline Ryan, held the &quot;brunch des Yvettes&quot; at the Château Frontenac in Quebec City. The movement grew until a rally at the Montreal Forum on April 7 when close to 15,000 women, among them the federal Health Minister, a legislator in the National Assembly of Quebec, and incoming Speaker of the House of Commons, denounced the minister&#x27;s declarations about women and manifested their support for the &quot;No&quot; side.

== Campaign ==
On April 15, Lévesque announced before the National Assembly the referendum would occur on May 20, 1980. The same day, on the opening of the House of Commons, Trudeau announced that the Government of Canada would not negotiate sovereignty-association under any circumstances, as he considered the question too vague and the Canadian government&#x27;s authority too uncertain to do so. He also stated that the question was too vague to give Lévesque and the PQ any mandate to declare independence, making any result from a &quot;Yes&quot; vote impossible; in contrast, he offered that a &quot;No&quot; vote would lead to constitutional change. His position was supported by Clark and national NDP leader Ed Broadbent.

The &quot;Yes&quot; campaign was, in the initial stages, low key. It focused on gaining broad acceptance of sovereignty-association through specialized &quot;&quot; that would be presented with special certificates at ceremonies led by Lévesque and other cabinet ministers. The regroupments were seen as an attempt to show broad support for the movement and create conversations at the ground level, however, the attempt to create them in some heavily Federalist professions, such as lawyers, prompted a severe backlash.

The &quot;No&quot; campaign, led by Ryan, was run as a traditional election campaign, with Ryan campaigning during the day and making speeches in local hockey arenas across rural Quebec.

Controversially, the Canadian government became involved on its own accord in the referendum despite the provisions of the provincial &quot;Referendum Act&quot;, which tightly restricted all campaigning to the designated &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; committees with set budgets. Canadian government politicians made appearances coordinated by Minister of Justice Jean Chrétien and Marc Lalonde, mainly speculating on the economic uncertainty a &quot;Yes&quot; vote could bring. Chrétien argued that prominent PQ member Claude Morin would sacrifice Canada&#x27;s oil and national gas price to drive in an ambassadors&#x27; Cadillac. Lalonde argued that old age pensions were directly threatened by a &quot;Yes&quot; vote. Though initially reluctant, Ryan started to accept and welcome the Canadian government&#x27;s help, and continued to speak across Quebec.

The referendum prompted an unheard-of political mobilization, and the campaign was seen as a traumatic event in Quebec, as the hard choice between &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; shattered the nationalist consensus that had existed since the Quiet Revolution.

=== Trudeau at Paul Sauvé Arena ===
On May 14, six days before the vote, Trudeau made his final appearance at a packed Paul Sauvé Arena, where the PQ had celebrated their victory in 1976. Trudeau attacked the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign for not asking a clear question, and stated that a &quot;Yes&quot; vote was a dead end, given that the rest of Canada was not bound by the question and that it was too vague to pursue independence if negotiations were refused.

Trudeau then stated that he would interpret a vote for the &quot;No&quot; as a mandate to renew federalism and change the constitution, putting his MPs&#x27; seats on the line if he were to fail to keep this promise. Addressing himself to Canadians outside Quebec on behalf of his MPs, Trudeau challenged English Canada that change would have to occur and that the referendum could not be interpreted as an endorsement of the status quo.

After this Trudeau hit an emotional high note, invoking a remark by Lévesque days earlier that he was showing his &quot;Elliott&quot; side during the campaign. Trudeau detailed the story of his parents, who had both had many ancestors in Quebec, and remarked that his full name was both a Québécois and a Canadian name. Trudeau then began to list members of the Parti Québécois who had Irish or English last names. The riposte brought the crowd to an uproar, and Trudeau exited to chants of &quot;Elliott.&quot;

The speech, which prompted Morin to wonder if his mind was changed, was seen as the death knell of the &quot;Yes&quot; camp, despite Lévesque&#x27;s attempts to cast doubt over Trudeau&#x27;s words.

== Results ==


== Immediate aftermath ==
After the lopsided defeat, a visibly emotional Lévesque addressed his supporters, many of whom were shown on screen in tears at the result. Lévesque began with, &quot;My dear friends, if I understand you correctly, you&#x27;re saying: &#x27;until next time. While calling the Canadian government&#x27;s involvement in the campaign &quot;scandalously immoral&quot;, he emphasized that the result must be accepted and that it was now the Canadian government&#x27;s responsibility to provide the promised changes to the constitution. He ended asking the audience to sing &quot;&quot; for him, as he did not have any voice left.

Claude Ryan&#x27;s speech was later in the evening. After refusing to let Jean Chrétien use the microphone to address those gathered, he proceeded to demand an election be called and listed every riding that had voted for the &quot;No&quot; side. The speech was generally seen as callous and harsh, especially after the emotional crowd scenes broadcast during Lévesque&#x27;s speech. Trudeau addressed the country afterward with a more conciliatory tone, emphasizing the need for unity after the hurt feelings and strained friendships that had been caused by the referendum. The next morning, Chrétien was tasked with creating a provincial consensus.

In Montreal, reactions were divided and emotional. Many predicted the referendum would result in violence and an early election. Shortly after results were released, a small riot of “Yes” voters marched through Westmount, a wealthy English neighbourhood, causing minor property damage. The aftermath of the referendum was filled with uncertainty, with sociologist Maurice Penard predicting more violence and an early election.

==Effects==
After the referendum, Trudeau acted upon his promise by calling together the provincial premiers in a first ministers&#x27; conference. The meeting showed signs of deadlock, and Lévesque surprised observers by uniting with the dissident premiers, who warmly received his decentralist views. Facing a lack of cooperation from the premiers, Trudeau then announced his intention to unilaterally patriate the constitution from the United Kingdom and have a charter of rights and constitutional amending formula approved by national referendum.

In the meantime, there was a provincial election in Quebec. Despite a brief post-referendum malaise, the PQ easily defeated Ryan&#x27;s Liberals in the 1981 provincial election, campaigning both on their governing record and against Trudeau&#x27;s intentions. Notably, the PQ did not promise to hold a second referendum.

With regards to Trudeau&#x27;s plans to unilaterally patriate and change the constitution, the newly re-elected Lévesque, who had initially argued for the incorporation of a Quebec veto into the new constitution, agreed with eight other premiers (the Gang of Eight) to a proposal that would not allow Quebec a veto, but would permit &quot;opting out&quot; of certain federal endeavours with compensation.

The federal government, still interested in proceeding unilaterally, sought an opinion on whether it was legally entitled to do so from the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court ruled that any constitutional changes, including patriation of the constitution, could be made unilaterally under the letter of the law, but, by non-binding convention, &quot;a substantial degree of provincial consent was required&quot;.

The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision prompted a final meeting among the first ministers. Lévesque abandoned the Gang of Eight and opted to join Trudeau in advocating immediate patriation with the promise of a future referendum on the other matters. The other premiers, loath to be seen arguing against the charter of rights that was included in Trudeau&#x27;s proposed constitutional changes, formulated a compromise proposal with Jean Chrétien that was acceptable to the Canadian government. The compromise came during the Kitchen Meeting, which took place after Lévesque had left for the evening. In Quebec, that night has sometimes been called the &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot;.

As a result of the compromise between the premiers (other than Lévesque) and the federal government, the government patriated the Canadian constitution in the Constitution Act, 1982 without support from Lévesque or Quebec&#x27;s National Assembly. The result was a shattering defeat for the PQ, especially after the Quebec government&#x27;s loss in its Quebec Veto Reference case. The National Assembly of Quebec, compared to its position in 1976, actually lost power under Lévesque and the PQ.

Historical debate would centre on whether Trudeau&#x27;s advocacy and agreement on patriation were in accord with or in contravention of his commitments made in his speech at the Paul Sauvé Arena. Trudeau defended his actions by stating he had kept his promise to deliver a new constitution that resided entirely within Canada and an embedded Charter of Rights. Quebec nationalists argue that this is an overly literal view of his words and that, in context to a Québécois audience, Trudeau had promised that Quebec would be given a status in accordance with a decentralized view of federalism, or his MPs would resign.

In 1984, Brian Mulroney led the Progressive Conservatives to victory nationally, having committed during the campaign to try to find a way to accommodate Quebec&#x27;s objections to the constitution. Lévesque pledged to take the risk of trying to work towards a deal with Mulroney. This led to a split in the PQ and subsequently Lévesque&#x27;s resignation from politics in 1985. After the PQ defeat by the Liberals of Robert Bourassa, the Mulroney government began negotiations with Quebec to find a deal that would be acceptable to all provinces. The 1987 Meech Lake Accord and the 1992 Charlottetown Accord, despite receiving unanimous consent among the provincial premiers, each failed in dramatic public fashion, reviving the sovereignty movement.

The PQ returned to office, led by hard-line separatist and former Finance Minister Jacques Parizeau, in 1994. Parizeau called a second sovereignty referendum of 1995, which featured a more direct question. That referendum failed by a margin of less than 0.6%.

Libya has mostly a flat undulating plain and occasional plateau, with an average elevation of around . Around 91 per cent of the land is covered by desert, with only 8.8 per cent agricultural land (with only 1% arable lands) and 0.1 per cent of forests. The major resources are petroleum, gypsum and natural gas. Along the coastal regions, the climate is Mediterranean in coastal areas, while it is desert climate in all other parts. Dust storms lasting four to eight days is pretty common during spring. Triplotania is the northwest region, while it is Cyrenacia in the east and Fezzen in the southwest. Cyrenacia is the largest region in Libya, which is mostly semi arid in nature. The region receives an annual rainfall of . There are no perennial rivers in the region, but the region is abundant with groundwater aquifers.

==Administration==
Libya became independent in 1951 from the colonial empire and generally known for its oil-rich resources. All the powers rested centrally with the Brotherly Leader Gaddafi, for 42 years till the 2011 armed rebellion which topple him. As per the constitution, Libya is the most decentralized Arab nation, but practically all powers are vested on central government on account of control over the oil revenues. Local governmental institutions manage the administration of education, industry, and communities. As a part of decentralization in 2012, the country is administratively split into 13 regions from the original 25 municipalities, which were further divided in 1,500 communes. Since 2015, the chief of the state is a chairman of Presidential Council, while the prime minister is the head of the state. The House of Representatives is an elected body that is elected on universal suffrage and popular vote. As of 2016, there were 22 administrative divisions in the country in the form of districts.

<text>In art history, &quot;Old Master&quot; (or &quot;old master&quot;) refers to any painter of skill who worked in Europe before about 1800, or a painting by such an artist. An &quot;old master print&quot; is an original print (for example an engraving, woodcut, or etching) made by an artist in the same period. The term &quot;old master drawing&quot; is used in the same way.

In theory, &quot;Old Master&quot; applies only to artists who were fully trained, were Masters of their local artists&#x27; guild, and worked independently, but in practice, paintings produced by pupils or workshops are often included in the scope of the term. Therefore, beyond a certain level of competence, date rather than quality is the criterion for using the term.

==Period covered==
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the term was often understood as having a starting date of perhaps 1450 or 1470; paintings made before that were &quot;primitives&quot;, but this distinction is no longer made. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines the term as &quot;A pre-eminent artist of the period before the modern; esp. a pre-eminent western European painter of the 13th to 18th centuries.&quot; The first quotation given is from 1696, in the diary of John Evelyn: &quot;My L: Pembroke..shewed me divers rare Pictures of very many of the old &amp; best Masters, especially that of M: Angelo..,&amp; a large booke of the best drawings of the old Masters.&quot; The term is also used to refer to a painting or sculpture made by an Old Master, a usage datable to 1824. There are comparable terms in Dutch, French, and German; the Dutch may have been the first to make use of such a term, in the 18th century, when &quot;oude meester&quot; mostly meant painters of the Dutch Golden Age of the previous century. &quot;Les Maitres d&#x27;autrefois&quot; of 1876 by Eugene Fromentin may have helped to popularize the concept, although &quot;vieux maitres&quot; is also used in French. The famous collection in Dresden at the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister is one of the few museums to include the term in its actual name, although many more use it in the title of departments or sections. The collection in the Dresden museum essentially stops at the Baroque period.

The end date is necessarily vague – for example, Goya (1746–1828) is certainly an Old Master, though he was still painting and printmaking at his death in 1828. The term might also be used for John Constable (1776–1837) or Eugène Delacroix (1798–1868), but usually is not. Edward Lucie-Smith gives an end date of 1800, noting &quot;formerly used of paintings earlier than 1700&quot;.

The term tends to be avoided by art historians as too vague, especially when discussing paintings, although the terms &quot;Old Master Prints&quot; and &quot;Old Master drawings&quot; are still used. It remains current in the art trade. Auction houses still usually divide their sales between, for example, &quot;Old Master Paintings&quot;, &quot;Nineteenth-century paintings&quot;, and &quot;Modern paintings&quot;. Christie&#x27;s defined the term as ranging &quot;from the 14th to the early 19th century&quot;.

The relevant part of the large and important collection of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in their main building in Brussels was renamed in recent years as the Oldmasters Museum in Dutch and English, and Musée Oldmasters in French. It was previously called the &quot;Royal Museum of Ancient Art&quot; in English (; ).

==Anonymous artists==
Artists, most often from early periods, whose hand has been identified by art historians, but to whom no identity can be confidently attached, are often given names (a Notname) by art historians such as &quot;Master E.S.&quot; (from his monogram), &quot;Master of Flémalle&quot; (from a previous location of a work), &quot;Master of Mary of Burgundy&quot; (from a patron), &quot;Master of Latin 757&quot; (from the shelf mark of a manuscript he illuminated), &quot;Master of the Embroidered Foliage&quot; (from his characteristic technique), &quot;Master of the Brunswick Diptych,&quot; or &quot;Master of Schloss Lichtenstein&quot;.

<text>Jufra or Jofra () is one of the districts of Libya. It is in the centre of the country. Its capital is Hun. Jufra was originally one of the 25 baladiya in the administrative system of Libya established in 1988. In 2001, it became a &quot;Shabiya&quot;, and its territorial extension was reduced. In 2007, under the new 22-shabiya system, its original boundaries were reintroduced. Jufra borders Sirte in the north, Al Wahat in northeast, Kufra in east, Murzuq in south, Sabha in southwest, Wadi al Shatii in west and Jabal al Gharbi in northwest.

==History and Geography==

The surrounding area of the three oases in the Jufra district (Sukna, Hun and Waddan) feature the majority of modern activity and traces of ancient occupation. The oases facilitate access to water and thus are natural concentrations of life. This chain of oases consist of substantial archaeology of several types and periods. The area, which was until recently under-studied is subject to the Trans-Saharan project, which in collaboration with the EAMENA work to identify (through satellite imagery analysis) and record a range of archaeological sites in the Jufra district. 86 individual sites were identified and include settlements, cairn cemeteries, field systems and foggara. These sites enable researchers to establish an initial chronology ranging from the first millennium BC to early modern times and develop our understanding of the occupation periods in different areas. The sites are endangered from a number of threats, most notably from construction and cultivation.

Jufra is part of Fezzan geographical division of Libya and is mostly full of deserts. The region receives an annual rainfall of . There are no perennial rivers in the region, but the region is abundant with groundwater aquifers. Libya has mostly a flat undulating plain and occasional plateau, with an average elevation of around . Around 91 per cent of the land is covered by desert, with only 8.8 per cent agricultural land (with only 1% arable lands) and 0.1 per cent of forests. The major resources are petroleum, gypsum and natural gas. Dust storms lasting four to eight days are common during Spring. The vast Haruj volcanic field is one of Libya&#x27;s largest geographic features, visible from space.

==Demographics==
Per the estimates of 2012, the total population in the region was 157,747 with 150,353 Libyans. The average size of the household in the country was 6.9, while the average household size of non-Libyans being 3.7. There were totally 22,713 households in the district, with 20,907 Libyan ones. The population density of the district was 1.86 persons per km2. Per 2006 census, there were totally 20,127 economically active people in the district. There were 11,057 government employees, 2,315 employers, and 6,000 first level workers. There were 5,348 workers in state administration, 2,715 in agriculture, animal husbandry and forestry, 3,056 in agriculture &amp; hunting, 4,714 in education, 1,515 in private enterprises, 763 in health &amp; social work, 1,453 in production, 4,808 in technical work and 729 service workers. The total enrollment in schools was 15,876 and the number of people above secondary stage and less than graduation was 992.
As per the report from World Health Organization (WHO), there were no communicable disease centres, one dental clinic, one general clinics, no in-patient clinics, three out-patient clinics, 12 pharmacies, 12 PHC centres, no polyclinics, one rural clinic and no specialized clinics.

==Local administration==

Libya became independent in 1951 from Britain and France and generally known for its oil rich resources. All the powers rested centrally with the President Gaddafi for 42 years till the 2011 armed rebellion which toppled him. As per the constitution, Libya is the most decentralized Arab nation, but practically all powers are vested on central government on account of control over the oil revenues. Local governmental institutions manage the administration of education, industry, and communities. As a part of decentralization in 2012, the country is administratively split into 13 regions from the original 25 municipalities, which were further divided in 1,500 communes. Since 2015, the chief of the state is a Chairman of Presidential Council, while the Prime Minister is the head of the state. The House of Representatives is an elected body that is elected on universal suffrage and popular vote. As of 2016, there were 22 administrative divisions in the country in the form of districts.

<text>The Victorian [[gold rush]] was a period in the history of Victoria, Australia, approximately between 1851 and the late 1860s. It led to a period of extreme prosperity for the Australian colony and an influx of population growth and financial capital for Melbourne, which was dubbed &quot;Marvellous Melbourne&quot; as a result of the procurement of wealth.

== Overview ==

The Victorian Gold Discovery Committee wrote in 1854:
With the exception of the more extensive fields of California, for a number of years the gold output from Victoria was greater than in any other country in the world. Victoria&#x27;s greatest yield for one year was in 1856, when 3,053,744 troy ounces (94,982 kg) of gold were extracted from the diggings. From 1851 to 1896 the Victorian Mines Department reported that a total of 61,034,682 oz (1,898,391 kg) of gold was mined in Victoria.

Gold was first discovered in Australia on 15 February 1823, by assistant surveyor James McBrien, at Fish River, between Rydal and Bathurst (in New South Wales). The find was considered unimportant at the time and was not pursued for policy reasons.

In the 1850s gold discoveries in Victoria, in Beechworth, Castlemaine, Daylesford, Ballarat and Bendigo sparked gold rushes similar to the California Gold Rush. At its peak, some two tonnes of gold per week flowed into the Treasury Building in Melbourne.

The gold exported to Britain in the 1850s paid off all of Britain&#x27;s foreign debts and helped lay the foundation of her enormous commercial expansion in the latter half of the century.

Melbourne was a major boomtown during the gold rush. The city became the centre of the colony with rail networks radiating to the regional towns and ports.

Politically, Victoria&#x27;s gold miners sped up the introduction of greater parliamentary democracy in Victoria, based on British Chartist principles adopted to some extent by the miners&#x27; activist bodies such as Bendigo&#x27;s Anti-Gold Licence Association and the Ballarat Reform League.

As the alluvial gold dwindled, pressures for land reform, protectionism and political reform generated social struggles, and a Land Convention in Melbourne during 1857 recorded demands for land reform.

By 1854, Chinese people were contributing to the gold rushes. Their presence on the goldfields of Bendigo, Beechworth and the Bright district resulted in riots, entry taxes, killings, and segregation in the short term, and became the foundations of the White Australia policy. In short, the gold rush was a revolutionary event and reshaped Victoria, its society and politics.

== Background ==
There were rumours abroad about the presence of gold in Australia, but Government officials kept all findings secret for fear of disorganising the young colony. However the Colonial Secretary, Edward Deas Thomson, saw a great future for the country when Edward Hargraves proved his theory that Australia was a vast storehouse of gold. Hargraves had been in the California gold rush and knew gold country, when he first saw it, round Bathurst. The news spread like wildfire, and soon the race was on from coast to gold fields. Flocks were left untended, drovers deserted their teams, merchants and lawyers rushed from their desks and entire ships&#x27; crews, captains included, marched off to seek their fortunes.

===Gold discovery===
In March 1850, William Campbell of Strath Loddon, found on the station of his brother-in-law, Donald Cameron, of Clunes several minute pieces of native gold in quartz. This was concealed at the time but on 10 January 1851, Campbell disclosed it. Others had found indications of gold. Dr. George H. Bruhn, a German physician, whose services as an analyst were in great demand, had been shown specimens of gold from what afterwards became the Clunes diggings. In spite of these and other discoveries, however, it was impracticable to market the gold, and James Esmond&#x27;s &quot;find&quot; which was made on Creswick&#x27;s Creek, a tributary of the Loddon River, at Clunes on 1 July 1851, was the first marketable gold field.

A party formed by Mr. Louis John Michel, consisting of himself, Mr. William Haberlin, James Furnival, James Melville, James Headon, and B. Groenig, discovered the existence of gold in the quartz rocks of the Yarra ranges, at Andersons Creek, near Warrandyte, in the latter part of June, and showed it on the spot to Dr. Webb Richmond, on behalf of the Gold Discovery Committee on 5 July.

The third discovery was by Mr. Thomas Hiscock, a resident at Buninyong; induced by the writings of the Rev. W. B. Clarke, and by the discovery of Brentani&#x27;s nugget in the Pyrenees district two years before, he had kept a constant lookout for gold in his neighbourhood. He discovered an auriferous deposit in the gully of the Buninyong ranges now bearing his name, on 8 August 1851, and he communicated the fact, with its precise locality, to the editor of the &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot; on the 10th of that month.

Dr. George H. Bruhn, a German physician, in the month of January, 1851, (i.e. before Mr. Hargraves&#x27; discovery at Summerhill) started from Melbourne to explore &quot;the mineral resources of this colony&#x27;. During his lengthened tour, he found, in April, indications of gold in quartz about two miles from Mr. Barker&#x27;s station, and on arriving at Mr. Cameron&#x27;s station was shown by that gentleman specimens of gold at what are now called the Clunes diggings. This information he made widely known through the country in the course of his journey, and communicated to Mr. James Esmond, at that time engaged in erecting a building at Mr. James Hodgkinson&#x27;s station. Dr. Bruhn forwarded specimens, which were received by the Gold Discovery Committee on 30 June 1851.

The Gold Discovery Committee awarded £1000 to Michel and his party; £1000 to Hiscock, as the substantial discoverer of the Ballarat deposits; £1000 to Campbell as the original discoverer of Clunes; £1000 to Esmond as the first active producer of alluvial gold for the market and £500 to Dr. Bruhn.

On 20 July 1851 Thomas Peters, a hut-keeper on William Barker&#x27;s &quot;Mount Alexander&quot; station, found specks of gold at what is now known as Specimen Gully. This find was published in the Melbourne &quot;Argus&quot; on 8 September 1851, leading to a rush to the Mount Alexander or Forest Creek diggings, centred on present-day Castlemaine, claimed as the richest shallow alluvial goldfield in the world.

These discoveries were soon surpassed by Ballarat and Bendigo. Further discoveries including Beechworth in 1852, Bright, Omeo, Chiltern (1858–59) and Walhalla followed.

The population of Melbourne grew swiftly as the gold fever took hold, as did the colony&#x27;s total population: from 1851 to 1861, it grew from 75,000 to 500,000.

Surface alluvial gold was the first to be exploited. It is reported that in 1851, when the first miners arrived on the Mount Alexander goldfield, near Castlemaine, nuggets could be picked up without digging. Then followed the exploitation of alluvial gold in creeks and rivers, or deposited in silt on river banks and flats. The gold-seekers used pans, sluice boxes and cradles to separate this gold from the dirt.

As surface alluvial gold ran out, gold seekers were forced to look further underground. Miners discovered so-called deep leads, which were gold-bearing watercourses that had been buried at various depths by centuries of silting and, in some Victorian goldfields such as Ballarat, volcanic action. They also began to exploit the underground gold reefs which were the original sources of the gold. Deep mining was more difficult and dangerous. Places such as Bendigo and Ballarat saw great concentrations of miners, who were forming partnerships and syndicates to enable them to sink ever-deeper shafts. Coupled with erratic and vexatious policing and licence checks, tensions flared around Beechworth, Bendigo and Ballarat. These frictions culminated in the Eureka Rebellion in Ballarat in 1854. Following that uprising, a range of reforms gave miners a greater say in resolving disputes via Mining Courts, and extended electoral franchise to them.

As gold-rush immigrants flooded into Victoria in 1852, a tent city, known as &quot;Canvas Town&quot;, was established at South Melbourne. The area soon became a massive slum, home to tens of thousands of migrants from around the world who arrived to seek their fortunes in the goldfields. Significant Chinatowns became established in Melbourne, Bendigo and Castlemaine.

At Walhalla alone, Cohens Reef produced over 50 tonnes (1.6 million tr oz) of gold in 40 years of mining.

== Chinese involvement in the Victorian gold rush ==
News of the gold discoveries in the colonies of New South Wales and Victoria in 1851 quickly arrived in the provinces of Southern China. By the end of 1855, more than 19,000 Chinese immigrants, particularly from the Guangdong province of China, were estimated to be working on the Victorian goldfields of Ararat, Ballarat, Ovens, Bendigo, Castlemaine and Maryborough. By 1858 this number increased to roughly 33,000 and Chinese miners were estimated to have made up approximately one fifth of Victoria&#x27;s miner population. Figures suggest that Victoria&#x27;s Chinese population began to dwindle after 1858. This is likely due to a decrease in the number of new gold discoveries in Victoria during this period.  

Like European gold diggers, the majority of Chinese miners in Victoria worked either independently or with a partner upon arrival. As gold however became harder to find in Victoria&#x27;s goldfields the Chinese population of Victoria began to form their own mining cooperatives and companies. An unofficial 1868 census on the Chinese population in Victorian gold districts suggests that 660 out of the 765 Chinese miners in Daylesford and half of the 4000 Chinese miners in the Oven District had &quot;form[ed] themselves into small companies&quot; by 1868.

A minority of Chinese miners in Victoria were also employed by European mining companies. The 1868 census on the Chinese population in Victoria suggests that 700 Chinese miners in the Oven District were working for European companies which were paying their employees £1 to £2 per week. Smaller numbers of Chinese miners were also reported to be working for European companies in Maryborough, Ballarat and Daylesford.

The rapid influx of Chinese migrants into the Colony of Victoria aroused large amounts of anxiety within Victoria&#x27;s European population. On April the 14th 1855, &quot;The Argus&quot;, a daily newspaper in Melbourne, described the growing Chinese population within Victoria as an &quot;invading army&quot; whose presence will &quot;subject the community to the demoralizing influence of their ideas&quot;.

In June 1855, the Victorian government passed &#x27;an act to make provision for certain immigrants&#x27;. The act sought to limit the number of Chinese immigrants that a vessel could carry to one for every ten tons of shipping and required the ship&#x27;s master to pay a £10 poll tax for each Chinese passenger it carried. The act however failed to reduce the number of Chinese arriving on Victorian Gold Fields. By landing at the port of Robe in the colony of South Australia and travelling more than 400 km across country to the Victorian goldfields, Chinese gold seekers were able to successfully evade the restrictions of Victoria&#x27;s immigration act.

In November 1857, the Victorian government passed &#x27;an act to regulate the residence of the Chinese Population in Victoria&#x27;. This act required all Chinese residing in Victoria to obtain a £1 license which had to be renewed every two months for an additional £1 in order to remain in the Colony of Victoria. The residence tax was, however, reduced in February 1859 and repealed in 1862 due to Chinese protests against the legislation, increasing levels of tax evasion, and a downturn in Victoria&#x27;s mining population.

The increasing presence of Chinese miners on Victorian goldfields eventually resulted in anti-Chinese riots taking place on several Victorian goldfields. On 8 July 1854, an estimated 1500 European miners meeting at a hotel in Bendigo planned a riot to drive the Chinese out of Bendigo. This riot was, however, brought to a stop by the arrival of police. The worst attack on Victoria&#x27;s Chinese miners occurred at the goldfields of Buckland River on 4 July 1857. Following a group meeting at the Buckland Hotel, an estimated 100 European miners sought to expel all 2500 Chinese miners that occupied the goldfields of the Buckland River through the use of tent and store burning, robbery and beatings. Drowning and severe beatings are believed to have resulted in the death of several Chinese miners. This event has come to be known as the Buckland Riot.

==Lead-up to the Eureka Stockade==
The conditions which led up to the Eureka Stockade arose mainly from the actions taken by the Government in supervising the various goldfields. To meet the expense of securing order and to restrain unauthorised mining on Crown land, a local Act of January 1852 imposed on all diggers a licence fee of 30 shillings per month, the penalty for mining without a licence being £6 for the first offence and afterwards imprisonment for terms up to six months. Clause 7 of this Act also appropriated half the fine to the use of the informer or prosecutor, a provocative and irritating provision. In December, 1853, an amending Act reduced the fee to £1 per month, but did not alter the diggers&#x27; greatest grievance, that they could be imprisoned for not having the actual licence on them, though their possession of one could be proved from the official record. They were also unrepresented in Parliament, and in 1854 the population on the Ballarat goldfields was estimated at 20,000.

Charles Hotham, who arrived in Victoria in June 1854, was alarmed at the depleted state of the Treasury and the growing expense of goldfields administration. He ordered the police to redouble their exertions in collecting the fees. To miners just scraping by, the payment of £12 per annum was impossible, and there is no doubt that hundreds did endeavour to evade payment, but the innocent suffered with the guilty. The police, too, had been largely recruited from Tasmania, and many were ex-convicts. These grievances were common to all the Victorian fields, and had under Latrobe&#x27;s administration produced riots at Beechworth and Castlemaine, but Ballarat, always the most domestic of the goldfields, was renowned for its peaceful progressiveness and quietness.

On the night of 6 October, however, a Scottish miner named James Scobie was killed at the Eureka Hotel, near Ballarat, and the murdered man&#x27;s associate blamed the murder on the proprietor, Bentley, a Tasmanian ex-convict. Bentley was brought up before a magistrate, who was alleged to be financially under Bentleys&#x27; thumb, and he was discharged. The miners were indignant; a meeting was called and a demand made for a fresh prosecution. The meeting itself was orderly, but towards the end of proceedings a cry was raised that the police (who had been ordered to protect the hotel) were trying to disperse the meeting, and the miners, becoming furious, swept aside the police, smashed the windows and furniture, and burned the building. The police arrested three men- who could not be proved to have been ringleaders or active in the riot, and they were sentenced to three, four, and six months&#x27; imprisonment.

At an indignation meeting held on 11 November on Bakery Hill, the Ballarat Reform League was formed, with John Basson Humffray (a Welshman) as its first secretary, and Peter Lalor, Frederic Vern (a Hanoverian), Raffaello Carboni (an Italian teacher, of languages), Timothy Hayes (an Irishman), and George Black, a well-educated Englishman, as prominent members. A deputation of three men waited on Governor Hotham to demand the release of the prisoners, but he refused and had already sent additional troops to Ballarat, which gave considerable offence by marching through the town with fixed bayonets and by other exasperating conduct. On 29 November, Black, Humffray, and Kennedy reported to a mass meeting held at Bakery Hill the result of their deputation to the Governor, and Vern proposed a burning of the hated licences, which was then carried out. Next day the police carried out a specially vicious and vigorous licence-hunt, and when the troops marched back to camp, the diggers hastened to a conference with the leaders of the Reform League.

Peter Lalor was elected leader, and under a blue flag adorned with the stars of the Southern Cross the assembled diggers swore &#x27;to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties.&#x27; An area of about an acre on the present Eureka site was hastily enclosed with a pallisade and a deputation was sent to the military camp demanding the release of the morning&#x27;s prisoners and the cessation of licence-hunting. The Commissioner flatly refused the request, saying that the agitation was &#x27;only a cloak to cover a democratic revolution.&#x27; On 1 December the occupants of the stockade were hard at work by 5 a.m. drilling and improving the barrier, and a German blacksmith was fashioning pike-heads. But neither food nor ammunition was available within the stockade, so that by the evening of the 2nd after a very hot day, not more than 200 remained within.

Spies informed the Commissioner of the situation and about 4.30 a.m. on Sunday morning (3 December) a troop of 276 men was marched silently to the stockade. Inside the stockade only 50 diggers had rifles; there was also a troop of Californian diggers armed with revolvers and another of Irishmen with pikes. Many of them were asleep when the signal gun was fired and a storming party of 64 &#x27;rushed&#x27; the stockade. In the first volleys several men fell on both sides, but the line of advancing bayonets, flanked on both sides by cavalry and mounted police, was too much for the diggers. They turned to seek shelter and all was over. Of the military force Captain Wise and four private soldiers were killed, and about a dozen injured. Sixteen miners were killed, and at least eight others died of their wounds, 114 prisoners were taken, and Lalor, badly wounded, managed to escape; so did Black and Vern. The Government then offered £500 for the apprehension of Vern, and £200 each for Black and Lalor.

==Legacy==

Australia&#x27;s population changed dramatically as a result of the rushes. In 1851 the Australian population was 437,655, of which 77,345, or just under 18%, were Victorians. A decade later the Australian population had grown to 1,151,947 and the Victorian population had increased to 538,628; just under 47% of the Australian total and a seven-fold increase. In some small country towns where gold was found abundantly, the population could grow by over 1000% in a decade (e.g. Rutherglen had a population of about 2,000. Ten years later, it had approximately 60,000 which is a 3000% increase). The rapid growth was predominantly a result of the gold rushes.

The gold rush is reflected in the architecture of Victorian gold-boom cities like Melbourne, Castlemaine, Ballarat, Bendigo and Ararat. Ballarat today has Sovereign Hill—a recreation of a gold rush town—as well as the Gold Museum. Bendigo has a large operating gold mine system which also functions as a tourist attraction.

The rushes left Victorian architecture in towns in the Goldfields region such as Maldon, Beechworth, Clunes, Heathcote, Maryborough, Daylesford, Stawell, Beaufort, Creswick, St Arnaud, Dunolly, Inglewood, Wedderburn and Buninyong whose economy has differing emphases on home working, tourism, farming, modern industrial and retired sectors. With the exception of Ballarat and Bendigo, many of these towns were substantially larger than they are today. Most populations moved to other districts when gold played out in a given locality. At the other end of the spectrum ghost towns, such as Walhalla, Mafeking and Steiglitz exist.
The last major gold rush in Victoria was at Berringa, south of Ballarat, in the first decade of the 20th century. Gold mining became nothing more than a hobby in Victoria for decades mainly because of the depth and cost of pumping. The First World War also drained Australia of the labour needed to work the mines. More significantly, the prohibition on the export of gold from Australia in 1915 and the abolition of the gold standard, winding down stockpiling of gold and production of sovereigns throughout the Empire saw Australian gold towns shrink, in some cases, being totally abandoned. The slump in gold production never recovered. Gold mining ceased in Stawell in 1920, but recommenced in 1982 and continued into the 21st century. However, as of 2005 the recent increase in the gold price has seen a resurgence in commercial mining activity with mining resuming in both of the major fields of Bendigo and Ballarat. Exploration also proceeds elsewhere, for example, in Glen Wills, an isolated mountain area near Mitta Mitta in north-eastern Victoria.

<text>The Rally Sweden (), formerly the KAK-Rally, the International Swedish Rally, and later the Uddeholm Swedish Rally, is an automobile rally competition held in February in Värmland, Sweden and relocated to Umeå in 2022. First held in 1950, as a summer rally called the Rally to the Midnight Sun () with start and finish at separate locations, seventeen years later both start and finish became located in Karlstad. The main service park is located in the town of Torsby, which is actually much closer to the special stages than Karlstad. The competition is spread out over three days with the start of the first part on Friday morning and the finish on Sunday afternoon.

In 1973 the rally was introduced to the World Rally Championship and started to get international attention; the Swedish Rally has been also traditionally the only rally held on snow. Like Rally Finland, this rally is known to be very difficult for non-Nordic drivers. The first driver to win the Swedish Rally who wasn&#x27;t from Sweden or Finland was Frenchman Sébastien Loeb in 2004; Frenchman Sébastien Ogier was the second non-Nordic winner (with wins in 2013, 2015 and 2016), with Belgian Thierry Neuville and Estonian Ott Tänak also recording wins in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Spaniard Carlos Sainz finished second four times and third two times.

The rally has been cancelled three times; in 1974 due to the oil crisis, in 1990 because of the mild weather and in 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic. The rally was also not held in 2009 due to the WRC&#x27;s round rotation system. Weather continues to be a concern, as rising global temperatures reduce the likelihood of appropriately snowy conditions every year. The 2005 event was one of the warmest ever, turning many stages into mud and destroying the special studded snow tires used by the teams.

In 2021 it was announced that Rally Sweden would relocate to the northern Swedish city of Umeå after being held in the province of Värmland since its foundation. The primary reason for its relocation was that Umeå is considered a more snow safe region.

<doc id="469497" wikidata="Q790092" url="?curid=469497" title="Avalon Peninsula">
<text>The Avalon Peninsula () is a large peninsula that makes up the southeast portion of the island of Newfoundland in Canada. It is in size.

The peninsula is home to 270,348 people, about 52% of Newfoundland&#x27;s population, according to the 2016 Canadian census. The peninsula is the location of St. John&#x27;s, the provincial capital and largest city. It is connected to the main section of the island by the wide Isthmus of Avalon. The peninsula protrudes into the rich fishing zones near the Grand Banks. Its four major bays (Trinity Bay, Conception Bay, St. Mary&#x27;s Bay and Placentia Bay) have long been the centre of Newfoundland&#x27;s fishing industry.

==Geography and geology==
The Avalon Peninsula is pinched into smaller peninsulas formed by St. Mary&#x27;s Bay and Conception Bay. St. John&#x27;s is located in the northeast of the peninsula.

The Avalon Peninsula is a noted region for Precambrian fossils, and many Lagerstätten of the diverse Ediacaran biota are found on the peninsula. Mistaken Point is the original location of the first documented Ediacaran, &quot;Aspidella terranovica&quot; (which gets its specific name from Newfoundland). The peninsula gives its name to the ancient micro-continent Avalonia of which it was part.

==History==

In 1497, explorer John Cabot led an expedition from England in an attempt to reach the Spice Islands in the East Indies. He is said to have reached what is now known as Bonavista. The English established their first permanent settlement at Cuper&#x27;s Cove in 1610.

Sir George Calvert was later given a large land holding on the peninsula in 1619 from William Vaughan, whose previous colony of Cambriol failed. The initial colony of Ferryland grew to a population of 100, becoming the first successful permanent settlement on Newfoundland island. In 1623 Calvert was given a royal charter extending the royal lands and granting them the name Province of Avalon &quot;in imitation of Old Avalon in Somersetshire wherein Glassenbury stands, the first fruits of Christianity in Britain as the other was in that party of America&quot;. Calvert wished to make the colony a refuge for Roman Catholics facing persecution in England. In 1625, Calvert was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as the 1st Baron Baltimore.

A series of crises and calamities led Lord Baltimore to quit the colony in 1629 for &quot;some other warmer climate of this new world&quot;, which turned out to be Maryland, in the Chesapeake Bay Colony. His family maintained agents to govern Avalon until 1637, when the entire island of Newfoundland was granted by charter to Sir David Kirke and the 3rd Marquess of Hamilton.

In 1696, during King William&#x27;s War, the French destroyed many English villages in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign. They had settled along the St. Lawrence River and from the Atlantic coast to Quebec and Montreal.

During Queen Anne&#x27;s War, Commodore John Leake of the Royal Navy led an expedition aimed at capturing French ships around the peninsula and burning French settlements. The expedition was largely successful. During this same conflict, the French attempted to besiege the fortified English port of St. John&#x27;s, but were unsuccessful. They later returned and captured the town, burning it to the ground.

In the late eighteenth century, the longstanding rivalry between Great Britain and France erupted again in the Seven Years&#x27; War. It was fought in the North American colonies as well, where it was known to British colonists as the French and Indian War. The Battle of Signal Hill was fought on the peninsula in 1762. In this engagement, British soldiers and artillery under the command of William Amherst drove the French occupants of St. John&#x27;s from Signal Hill and into the town&#x27;s fort, where they soon surrendered.

<doc id="469520" wikidata="Q790090" url="?curid=469520" title="Avalon (1990 film)">
<text>Avalon is a 1990 American drama film written and directed by Barry Levinson and starring Armin Mueller-Stahl, Elizabeth Perkins, Joan Plowright and Aidan Quinn. It is the third in Levinson&#x27;s semi-autobiographical tetralogy of &quot;Baltimore films&quot; set in his hometown during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s: &quot;Diner&quot; (1982), &quot;Tin Men&quot; (1987), and &quot;Liberty Heights&quot; (1999). The film explores the themes of Jewish assimilation into American life, through several generations of a Polish immigrant family from the 1910s through the 1950s.

The film was released to critical acclaim, and was nominated for four Academy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards.

==Plot==
It is the late 1940s and early 1950s, and much has happened to the family of Polish Jewish immigrant Sam Krichinsky since he first arrived in America in 1914 and eventually settled in Baltimore.

Television is new. Neighborhoods are changing, with more and more families moving to the suburbs. Wallpaper has been Sam&#x27;s profession, but his son Jules wants to try his hand at opening a large discount-appliance store with his cousin, Izzy, maybe even do their own commercials on TV.

Jules and his wife, Ann, still live with his parents, but Ann is quietly enduring the way that her opinionated mother-in-law Eva dominates the household. Ann is a modern woman who even learns to drive a car, although Eva refuses to ride with her and takes a streetcar instead.

The family contributes to a fund to bring more relatives to America. Slights, real or imagined, concern the family, as when Jules and Ann finally move to the suburbs, a long way for their relatives to travel. After arriving late and finding a Thanksgiving turkey has been carved without him, Uncle Gabriel is offended and storms out, beginning a feud with Sam.

Sam also cannot understand the methods his grandson Michael&#x27;s teachers use in school, or why Jules and Izzy have changed their surnames to Kaye and Kirk as they launch their business careers. But when various crises develop, including an armed holdup and a devastating fire, the family gets through the problems together.

==Relationship with other &quot;Baltimore films&quot;==
Levinson frequently places links between his films that are set in Baltimore. For example, there is an image of a diner under construction, recalling the director&#x27;s &quot;Diner&quot;, which also featured a Hudson automobile whose purchase figures in &quot;Avalon&quot;″s plot. The house that the Krichinsky family leaves to move to the suburbs was used as a residence in &quot;Tin Men&quot;.

==Release and reception==
Tri-Star Pictures released &quot;Avalon&quot; on October 5, 1990, initially in six theaters before expanding the following week to 600. Levinson criticized how the studio underpromoted the film and expanded its release too soon, while studio president Mike Medavoy would later defend himself stating &quot;&quot;Avalon&quot; wasn’t a wide-market movie, and we spent a lot of money to prove we could do it well. Putting it in a lot of theaters maximized the chance of making back our investment. Maybe we guessed wrong, but I don’t think anyone in the business could have squeezed another nickel out of it--or &quot;Bugsy&quot;, for that matter&quot;.

&quot;Avalon&quot; holds a rating of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes from 28 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10.

<doc id="469521" wikidata="Q48200" url="?curid=469521" title="Kufra District">
<text>Kufra, Kufrah or Kofra ( &quot;&quot;), also spelled &quot;Cufra&quot; in Italian, is the largest district of Libya and the second largest such district in Africa. It is slightly smaller than the country of Turkmenistan. Its capital is Al Jawf, one of the oases in Kufra basin. There is a very large oil refinery near the capital. In the late 15th century, Leo Africanus reported an oasis in the land of the &quot;Berdoa&quot;, visited by a caravan coming from Awjila. It is possible that this oasis in question was either the Al Jawf or the Taiserbo oasis, and on early modern maps, the Al Kufra region was often labelled as &quot;Berdoa&quot; based on this report.

==History==
The name &quot;Kufra&quot; (comes from Kufuh and Epher) itself is a derivation from &quot;kafir&quot;, the Arabic term for non-Muslims. Kufra did not fall under the dominion of either the Arabs or the Ottomans and was owned by the Arab Bedouin tribe of the Zuwayya only in the mid-19th century, and eventually by the Italians by the 1930s. In 1931, during the campaign of Cyrenaica, General Rodolfo Graziani easily conquered Kufra, considered a strategic region, leading about 3,000 infantry and artillery personnel, supported by about twenty bombers.

==Geography==
Kufra&#x27;s location in Libya&#x27;s southeast places it on the country&#x27;s border with Egypt, Sudan (unlike any other Libyan district), and Chad. It borders the following regions of these countries, namely, New Valley Governorate, Egypt in the east, Shamaliyah State, Sudan in the southeast, North Darfur State, Sudan in the far southeast, and Bourkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region, Chad in the south. Domestically, it borders the following districts, namely, Murzuq in the west, Jufra in the northwest and Al Wahat in the north. Kufra is a part of Cyrenacian geographical subdivision, the largest region in Libya and which is mostly semi-arid in nature. The region receives average annual rainfall of . There are no perennial rivers in the region, although it is abundant with groundwater aquifers. The terrain of all three regions of the county is mostly a flat undulating plain and occasional plateau, with an average elevation of around . Around 91 per cent of the land is covered by desert, with only 8.8 per cent agricultural land (with only 1% arable lands) and 0.1 per cent of forests. It is desert climate in all other parts of the region. Dust storms lasting four to eight days are fairly common during the spring.

Per 2006 census, there were totally 13,313 economically active people in the district. There were 6,295 government employees, 2,178 employers, 6,454 first level workers, and 1 second level worker. There were 85 workers in state administration, 85 in agriculture, animal husbandry and forestry, 2,445 in agriculture and hunting, 2,029 in education, 1,558 in private enterprises, 584 in health and social work, 85 in production, 2,214 in technical work, and 354 service workers. The total enrollment in schools was 17,364 and the number of people above secondary stage and less than graduation was 875.
As per the report from World Health Organization (WHO), there was one communicable disease centre, one dental clinic, one general clinic, three out-patient clinics, five pharmacies, 16 PHC centres, one rural clinic, and no specialized clinics.

==Local administration==
During 2007, the northern part of Kufra District was moved to the newly created Al Wahat District. Besides the main Oasis group of the Kufra basin, four more oases belong to the region, which lie northwest of Kufra basin are Rebiana, Buzema, Wadi Zighen and Tazirbu. The oasis-valleys of Jabal Arkanu and Jebel Uweinat lie southeast of the basin. Libya became independent in 1951 from the colonial empire and generally known for its oil rich resources. As a part of decentralization in 2012, the country is administratively split into 13 regions from the original 25 municipalities, which were further divided in 1,500 communes. As of 2016, there were 22 administrative divisions in the country in the form of districts.

<text>The Santa Clara River () is an long river in Ventura and Los Angeles counties in Southern California. It drains parts of four ranges in the Transverse Ranges System north and northwest of Los Angeles, then flows west onto the Oxnard Plain and into the Santa Barbara Channel of the Pacific Ocean.

The watershed has provided habitat for a wide array of native plants and animals and has historically supplied humans with water, fish, and fertile farmland. The northern portion of the watershed was home to the Tataviam people while the southern portion was occupied by the Chumash people. Much of the Santa Clara River Valley is used for agriculture which has limited the use of structural levees to separate the natural floodplain from the river. Although it is one of the least altered rivers in Southern California, some levees exist where the river flows through areas of significant urban development.

==History==
The Santa Clara River was originally named the Río de Santa Clara on August 9, 1769, by the Portolá expedition on the march north from San Diego to found a mission at Monterey, to honor Saint Clare of Assisi who died on August 11, 1253. The Santa Clara River Valley was then known as the Cañada de Santa Clara.

The Santa Clara-Mojave River Ranger District of the Angeles National Forest is named after the Santa Clara River.

===Floods===
The failure and near complete collapse of the St. Francis Dam took place in the middle of the night on March 12, 1928. The dam was holding a full reservoir of of water that surged down San Francisquito Canyon and emptied into the river.

==Course==
The Santa Clara River&#x27;s headwaters take drainage from the northern slopes of the San Gabriel Mountains near the Angeles Forest Highway, inside the western part of the Angeles National Forest. Its largest fork, Aliso Canyon, is about long and forms the primary headstream. These branches combine into the broad wash of the main stem near the town of Acton which flows west through Soledad Canyon, crossing under California State Route 14 near the town of Canyon Country. The Sierra Pelona Mountains on the north provide additional watershed and seasonal tributaries. The river receives Bouquet Creek, Placerita Creek, and San Francisquito Creek within the City of Santa Clarita. The riverbed surface remains dry most of the year here, except on extreme occasions of heavier than average rainfall. The river then crosses west under Interstate 5 and receives Castaic Creek from the right.

After the Castaic Creek confluence, the river starts to flow primarily southwest through the Santa Clarita Valley. Near the county line between Los Angeles County and Ventura County, the river enters the Santa Clara River Valley flowing past Buckhorn and Fillmore, incorporating additional flow from Piru Creek and Sespe Creek, both from the right, and Santa Paula Creek at the town of Santa Paula, where it passes the large South Mountain Oil Field on the south bank. The Santa Clara River then bends southwest, passing the Saticoy Oil Field on the north bank where South Mountain marks its entrance onto the broad Oxnard Plain. The river ends at the Pacific Ocean after flowing across the north side of this plain made fertile with the silt deposited by the river. A sand bar usually stands across the mouth at the Santa Clara Estuary Natural Preserve that lies within McGrath State Beach in Oxnard and bounded on the north by the city of Ventura wastewater treatment plant.

==Watershed==
Although located just north of the heavily populated Los Angeles Basin, the Santa Clara River watershed remains one of the most natural on the South Coast. It is separated from the Los Angeles Basin by the low Santa Susana Mountains, along the north side of which the Santa Clara River runs. On the east are the San Gabriel Mountains, and on the north are the Santa Ynez Mountains, Sespe Mountains, San Cayetano Mountains, and Tehachapi Mountains. Piru, Castaic and Sespe Creeks, each over long, are the primary tributaries of the Santa Clara River. While Piru and Castaic Creeks form reservoirs for the California State Water Project (Pyramid Lake and Lake Piru on Piru Creek, and Elderberry Forebay and Castaic Lake on Castaic Creek), Sespe Creek is designated a National Wild and Scenic River, unique among Southern California streams. There are 57 archaeological sites and 12 historical landmarks in the watershed.

The Santa Clara River watershed borders on the Ventura River/Matilija Creek watershed on the west. On the northwest lies the Santa Ynez River watershed. On the north is the interior drainage basin of Tulare Lake in the Central Valley. To the east is the Mojave River and to the south is the Los Angeles River. The Santa Clara River is the second largest river in Southern California; the larger one is the Santa Ana River.

==Estuary ==
The estuary has been modified by human activities at least since 1855. By the late 1920s roads and agricultural fields had become established. In the late 1950s the former delta area was occupied by the Ventura Water Reclamation Facility and agricultural fields with levees constraining the river from these areas and directing the flow to the Harbor Boulevard bridge. McGrath State Beach was established in 1948. The estuary has been designated a Natural Preserve within McGrath State Beach on the south bank of the river mouth.

From the north bank of the river, the city of Ventura releases some of treated effluent daily that flows into the Santa Clara Estuary Natural Preserve from their water reclamation facility (VWRF). A sand berm separates the river from the ocean most of the year. In years with adequate rainfall, the river breaks the berm which is then slowly rebuilt by ocean action through the rest of the year. When the river watershed has an exceptionally dry year, the berm acts as a dam, allowing the water level to rise with the discharge. In August 2014, with the frequent flooding of the access road and many of the campsites in the state park, a report found that the park had only been open five of the past eighteen months because of repeated flooding. When the berm is broken when it is not raining, fish can become stranded in the sudden draining of the estuary waters.

The estuary was identified on the 1998, 2002 and 2006 Clean Water Act 303(d) lists of impaired water bodies. In 2012, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board required the Counties of Ventura and Los Angeles together with cities along the river to limit the total maximum daily load of bacteria potentially harmful to human health that discharges from stormwater outfalls into the Santa Clara River, primarily during the dry season. Sources of bacteria of concern in urban runoff from the county, City of Fillmore, City of Oxnard, City of Santa Clarita, City of Santa Paula, and City of Ventura include pet and animal wastes, sanitary sewer overflows, and organic debris such as leaves and grass. Examples of ways they will improve water quality include increased frequencies of street sweeping and stormwater catch basin cleaning; field surveys to locate and eliminate both dry season street runoff and leaks from the sanitary sewer systems; and enhanced public education.

==Ecology==
The river is habitat for threatened species such as the unarmored three-spined stickleback, steelhead, southwestern pond turtle, and least Bell&#x27;s vireo. The endemic, endangered Santa Ana sucker (&quot;Catostomus santaanae&quot;) lives in parts of the Santa Clara River system.

Historic documentation of an important recreational steelhead trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) fishery occurs for the Santa Clara River into the mid-1900s. The steelhead trout run on the Santa Clara river prior to 1940 is estimated to have had thousands of fish and to have been one of the largest steelhead runs in southern California. Construction of the Vern Freeman Diversion Dam and other migration barriers on the mainstem, Santa Paula Creek, Sespe Creek, Piru Creek, and other tributaries during the mid-1900s appear to be correlated with the demise of the steelhead run as habitat availability decreased and surface flows decreased. Adult steelhead still try to migrate up the river with an adult trapped at the Vern Freeman Dam in 2001. A wild rainbow trout population still exists in the headwaters of the Santa Paula, Sespe, Hopper, and Piru Creek tributaries and is producing out-migrating steelhead smolts bound for the Pacific. However, challenges to outgoing smolt migration include low to no stream flows downstream of the dam or predation in the coastal estuary. Lampreys, a parasite, also impact the steelhead. Invasive species such as Arundo donax also create changes that are not favorable to spawning trout. Genetic analysis of the steelhead in the Santa Clara River watershed has shown them to be of native and not hatchery stocks.

There were beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) historically in the Santa Clara River until Europeans arrived, according to oral Ventureño history taken by ethnolinguist John Peabody Harrington in the early twentieth century. The full reference is: &quot;The beaver comes and gnaws the tree on the side towards which it leans, and at last falls over. The tree is leaning towards our house. I am beginning to fear that it will fall on us. The beaver builds its house in the river or the cienegas in the time of our ancestors. There were beavers at Ventura and also at Saticoy.&quot; This historical observer record is consistent with a beaver skull collected in 1906 in the Sespe Creek tributary by Dr. John Hornung, a zoologist at the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History.

Pronghorn antelope (&quot;Antilocapra americana&quot;) used to roam along the Santa Clara River, as Father Pedro Font, describe in his diary on the de Anza Expedition February 1776, &quot;We saw in the plain a very large drove of antelopes which, as soon as they saw us, fled like the wind, looking like a cloud skimming along the earth.&quot; There is a Ventureño word for antelope, &quot;q&#x27;aq&quot;, which is different from their separate words for deer and elk.

In 2002, eight Southwest willow flycatchers hatched in the Hedrick Ranch Nature Area (HRNA), a preserve just east of Santa Paula managed by the Friends of Santa Clara River. The first SWFs to hatch on the river in recent times was at the Fillmore Fish Hatchery in 2000.

Quagga mussels were discovered in Lake Piru in 2013. They are an invasive species found in rivers and lakes in the U.S.

==River modifications==
===In Ventura County===
The Harbor Boulevard bridge, the most westerly crossing, marks the upstream boundary of McGrath State Beach and the Ventura Water Reclamation Facility while the estuary continues a little farther upstream. In 1969 the river breached the north bank, flowed through an area that had historical been part of the estuary, flooded a new golf course and Harbor Boulevard, and deposited silt and debris into recently completed Ventura Harbor just upcoast from the reclamation facility.

Over the years, many communities have used the river banks as dumps to create levees that would keep the river from flooding adjacent lands during occasional years with heavy winter rains. Three dump sites about upstream from the mouth came under the control of the Ventura Regional Sanitation District by 1988. The district used the landfill gases to produce electricity until 2001. As the landfill aged and its contents decomposed, the release of gas became intermittent and the gases from the recovery system are burned off in a flare. The defunct power plant was built just upstream of the Victoria Avenue bridge, the second crossing upstream from the ocean.

The riverbed was mined extensively for sand and gravel throughout the post–World War II building boom for the construction of homes and highways. Mining the riverbed for sand and gravel impacts the riparian zones by destroying habitat and changes sediment flow regimes. The mining decreased significantly in the 1990s due to increased costs needed to satisfy environmental concerns and concerns that the removal of material increased scouring and undermining of bridge foundations and pipelines that crossed the river. there were still 3 active gravel operations in the upstream area.

There are also water diversions, most notably the Freeman Diversion Dam, located approximately from the ocean The United Water Conservation District, formed in 1950, battles groundwater overdraft through a combination of aquifer recharge and providing alternative surface water supplies. The District owns Lake Piru and key facilities along the Santa Clara River that are used to manage groundwater supplies. The district provides wholesale water delivery through three pipelines to various portions of the Oxnard Plain.

The Vern Freeman Diversion Dam, built by United Water in 1991 on the Santa Clara river, channels water to shallow basins designed to replenish the aquifer. For decades before the structure was built, earthen dams were constructed in the river to divert water to farmers and replenished the aquifer. The berms would have to be rebuilt whenever winter rains created a flow that breached the berms. Southern California Steelhead were declared endangered in 1997 and the fish ladder on the structure was deemed insufficient. The National Marine Fisheries Service determined in 2015 that fixing this was a high priority since it is the first structure the steelhead encounter when attempting to migrate from the ocean. A judge determined in 2018 that the federal Endangered Species Act had been violated by United Water by failing to ensure that the structure provided an adequate water supply and migratory passageway for steelhead.

====Treated Wastewater====
===In Los Angeles County===
The main channel of the Santa Clara River through the city of Santa Clarita remains largely natural, a variety of modifications have been made to the river and its major tributaries. The South Fork of the Santa Clara River features a system of 14 weirs that regulate the flow of the river through Newhall, Valencia, and Saugus. Bouquet Creek is channelized at the confluence of every minor creek that flows into it, most notably along a stretch of its riverbed near its confluence with the Santa Clara River.

The unincorporated community of Valencia is an under-construction, large scale master-planned community in Los Angeles County along the river in the easterly portion of the Santa Clarita Valley adjacent to Ventura County. The required permits for the project describe how the work will fill in and alter more than of flood plain and tributaries. These include threatened and endangered fauna and flora, including the California condor, the California gnatcatcher, the southwestern willow flycatcher, the least Bell&#x27;s vireo, the arroyo toad, the San Fernando Valley spineflower, and the threespine stickleback. The area is included in Los Angeles County&#x27;s Strategic Ecological Areas program, which designates areas of &quot;irreplaceable biological resources&quot;. The water reclamation plant serving the development will be near the boundary with Ventura County. The plant will treat an estimated of water every day before releasing it into the river as it flows towards the ocean and into Ventura County.

During the decades the project on the Newhall Ranch has been in planning, it has faced legal actions and environmental concerns. The downstream impact and other effects also drew Ventura County officials and citizens into opposition to the project. The landmark California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) used to challenge the development, may have led to a better-designed project while saving crucial habitat. In 2014, the California 2nd District Court of Appeal overturned a Los Angeles County Superior Court ruling and found that the environmental impact report adequately analyzed the project&#x27;s potential impact on endangered fauna and flora and Native American cultural artifacts. The ruling also supported the agency&#x27;s determination that storm-drain runoff from the project&#x27;s into the Santa Clara River would not harm juvenile steelhead trout downstream in Ventura County. Subsequently, the California Supreme Court agreed to review a petition that stated the appellate court opinion exempting developers from protections for the unarmored threespine stickleback would apply to other protected species such as the California Condor. the state Supreme Court directed lower courts to toss out the EIRs mentioned above for two phases of construction. After the EIRs had been toss out by the state Supreme Court in May 2016, changes were made to address the concerns. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife certified the environmental impact report in 2017. In July 2017, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors certified a revised environmental analysis and re-approved land-use permits for the Mission Village and Landmark Village communities.

==Restoration==

There has been significant interest in protecting and restoring the river habit. The riparian natural areas that remain along the river are of interest to several conservancy organizations. Easements are obtained that allow historical farming to continue and permanently protect the land from development. The river&#x27;s natural processes in the floodplain can continue with natural flooding of open space and agricultural fields. This avoids building levees that increase the risk of flooding downstream. The giant reed, or &quot;arundo&quot;, is a thirsty, invasive plant that lacks food value for native animals and impairs the growth of native plants.

The city of Santa Clarita protects significant portions of the natural ecology of the river within the Santa Clara River Open Space preserve, which includes portions of San Francisquito Creek and the South Fork of the Santa Clara River north of Lyons Avenue in Newhall.

Two wildlife corridor protection ordinances adopted by the county of Ventura restrict activities that impede the movement of mountains lions and other wildlife between the Santa Monica Mountains and the Los Padres National Forest. The river is included within the corridor especially at the junctions with major tributaries that connect to the Los Padres National Forest.

<doc id="469526" wikidata="Q7243173" url="?curid=469526" title="Primary sensory areas">
<text>The primary sensory areas are the primary cortical regions of the five sensory systems in the brain (taste, olfaction, touch, hearing and vision). Except for the olfactory system, they receive sensory information from thalamic nerve projections. The term &quot;primary&quot; comes from the fact that these cortical areas are the first level in a hierarchy of sensory information processing in the brain. This should not be confused with the function of the primary motor cortex, which is the &quot;last&quot; site in the cortex for processing motor commands.

Though some areas of the human brain that receive primary sensory information remain poorly defined, each of the five sensory modalities has been recognized to relate to specific groups of brain cells that begin to categorize and integrate sensory information.

* [[Somatosensory system]]: The primary somatosensory cortex (SI) is across the central sulcus and behind the primary motor cortex configured to generally correspond with the arrangement of nearby motor cells related to specific body parts. The area includes gray matter along the central gyrus and its extension into the postcentral gyrus.
* [[Primary sensory areas| The &quot;[[Gustatory cortex|primary gustatory area]]&quot; consists of the anterior part of the [[insular cortex|insula]] and the frontal [[operculum (brain)|operculum]].
* [[Primary sensory areas| The [[Primary olfactory cortex|olfactory cortex]] is located in the [[uncus]] which is found along the [[ventral]] surface of the [[temporal lobe]]. Olfaction is the only sensory system that is not routed through the thalamus.
* [[Primary sensory areas|[[Visual perception|Vision]]:]] The visual area known as V1, striate cortex, or ([[primary visual cortex]], Brodmann area 17) is located on the [[calcarine sulcus]] deep within the inside folds of the [[occipital lobe]].
* [[Primary sensory areas|[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]]:]] The [[primary auditory cortex]] is located on the transverse gyri that lie on the back of the superior temporal convolution of the [[temporal lobe]]s.

Following university, Anelay worked as a secondary school teacher from 1969 to 1974. She later became a volunteer adviser with the Citizens&#x27; Advice Bureau, served as a Justice of the Peace for Surrey and sat on the Social Security Appeal Tribunal.

<text>In Hawaiian mythology, Poliahu (Cloaked bosom or temple bosom) is one of the four goddesses of snow, all enemies of Pele. She was thought to reside on Mauna Kea, which if measured from the seafloor is the world&#x27;s tallest mountain.

== Legends==

===Aiwohikupua ===
Poliahu met the alii Aiwohikupua on the Eastern slope of Mauna Kea. The two fell in love and Aiwohikupua took Poliahu home to his native Kauai. There Poliahu discovered that the alii was already betrothed to a princess of Maui. Poliahu left in dismay, but managed to first curse the betrothed. She first chilled the princess of Maui to the bone, then turned the cold into heat. Finally, the princess gave up and left him. Later Poliahu similarly cursed Aiwohikupua, freezing him to death. The four goddesses are defined by their otherworldly beauty. Poliahu is noted as Hawaii&#x27;s most beautiful goddess.

=== Poliahu and Pele ===
Poliahu also engineered Hawaii&#x27;s Hāmākua Coast.

Poliahu mingled with humans on the East slope of Mauna Kea. One day, while hōlua sledding with mortals, Poliahu was joined by a beautiful stranger who challenged her. The stranger had no sled, so she borrowed one to run against Poliahu.

In the first run, Poliahu easily passed the stranger. Graciously, Poliahu exchanged sleds with the stranger, before winning again. On the third run, the stranger tried to prevent Poliahu from winning by opening lava streams in front of her, revealing herself as the volcano goddess Pele.

Poliahu ran towards the top of the mountain, reeling from Pele&#x27;s attack. Once she regained her composure, Poliahu threw snow at the lava and froze it, confining it to the island&#x27;s Southern end. To this day, Pele is said to rule Kīlauea and Mauna Loa, but must submit to Poliahu on the northern end of the island.

<doc id="469538" wikidata="Q5326261" url="?curid=469538" title="Earl of Ducie">
<text>Earl of Ducie is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1837 for Thomas Reynolds Moreton, 4th Baron Ducie. 

==History==
The Moreton family descends from Edward Moreton, who in the 17th century married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Ducie. Their son Matthew-Ducie Moreton represented Gloucestershire in the House of Commons. In 1720 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Ducie de Moreton, in the County of Stafford. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He was also a Member of Parliament and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Gloucestershire. In 1763 he was created Baron Ducie, of Tortworth in the County of Gloucester, with remainder to the sons of his sister Elizabeth Reynolds. This title was also in the Peerage of Great Britain.

On his death in 1770 the barony of 1720 became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony of 1763 according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Baron. He assumed the surname of Moreton by Act of Parliament in 1771. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie, a notable naval commander. He had earlier represented Lancaster in Parliament. Lord Ducie assumed the surname of Moreton by Act of Parliament in 1786. The remote Ducie Island in the South Pacific is named after him. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baron. In 1837 he was created Baron Moreton, of Tortworth in the County of Gloucester, and Earl of Ducie. These titles are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

His son, the second Earl, represented Gloucestershire and Gloucestershire East in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl. He was a Liberal politician and served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1859 to 1866 under Lord Palmerston and Lord Russell. His only son Henry Reynolds-Moreton, Lord Moreton, sat as Member of Parliament for Gloucestershire West. However, he predeceased his father and on Lord Ducie&#x27;s death the titles passed to his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He was a sheep and cattle farmer in Queensland, Australia, and also held several political offices in the state government. His son, the fifth Earl, was a dairy and fruit farmer in Australia. He was succeeded by his nephew, the sixth Earl. He was the son of Algernon Howard Moreton, second son of the fourth Earl. the titles are held by his eldest son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 1991.

Augustus Macdonald (who assumed the surname of Macdonald in lieu of Moreton), younger son of the first Earl, was a politician and writer.

==Family seat==

The ancestral seat of the Moreton family was Tortworth Court, Gloucestershire. Between 1848 and 1853, a new Tortworth Court was built for the second Earl of Ducie, in a Tudor style, to designs by the architect Samuel Sanders Teulon.
Another family seat was Spring Park, Gloucestershire, which was demolished and replaced with the incomplete Woodchester Mansion. 

The present family seat is the more modest Talbots End Farm, near Cromhall, Gloucestershire.

<doc id="469549" wikidata="Q3891499" url="?curid=469549" title="Free speech zone">
<text>Free speech zones (also known as First Amendment zones, free speech cages, and protest zones) are areas set aside in public places for the purpose of political protesting. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states that &quot;Congress shall make no law ... abridging ... the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot; The existence of free speech zones is based on U.S. court decisions stipulating that the government may reasonably regulate the time, place, and manner – but not content – of expression.

The Supreme Court has developed a four-part analysis to evaluate the constitutionality of time, place and manner (TPM) restrictions. To pass muster under the First Amendment, TPM restrictions must be neutral with respect to content, be narrowly drawn, serve a significant government interest, and leave open alternative channels of communication. Application of this four-part analysis varies with the circumstances of each case, and typically requires lower standards for the restriction of obscenity and fighting words.

Free speech zones have been used at a variety of political gatherings. The stated purpose of free speech zones is to protect the safety of those attending the political gathering, or for the safety of the protesters themselves. Critics, however, suggest that such zones are &quot;Orwellian&quot;, and that authorities use them in a heavy-handed manner to censor protesters by putting them literally out of sight of the mass media, hence the public, as well as visiting dignitaries. Though authorities generally deny specifically targeting protesters, on a number of occasions, these denials have been contradicted by subsequent court testimony. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed, with various degrees of success and failure, a number of lawsuits on the issue.

Although free speech zones existed prior to the presidency of George W. Bush, it was during Bush&#x27;s presidency that their scope was greatly expanded. These zones continued through the presidency of Barack Obama, who signed a bill in 2012 that expanded the power of the Secret Service to restrict speech and make arrests. Many colleges and universities earlier instituted free-speech-zone rules during the Vietnam-era protests of the 1960s and 1970s. In recent years, a number of them have revised or removed these restrictions following student protests and lawsuits.

==History==
During the 1988 Democratic National Convention, the city of Atlanta set up a &quot;designated protest zone&quot; so the convention would not be disrupted. A pro-choice demonstrator opposing an Operation Rescue group said Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young &quot;put us in a free-speech cage.&quot; &quot;Protest zones&quot; were used during the 1992 and 1996 United States presidential nominating conventions.

Free speech zones have been used for non-political purposes. Through 1990s, the San Francisco International Airport played host to a steady stream of religious groups (Hare Krishnas in particular), preachers, and beggars. The city considered whether this public transportation hub was required to host free speech, and to what extent. As a compromise, two &quot;free speech booths&quot; were installed in the South Terminal, and groups wishing to speak but not having direct business at the airport were directed there. These booths still exist, although permits are required to access the booths.

WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity saw a number of changes to how law enforcement deals with protest activities. &quot;The [National Lawyers] Guild, which has a 35-year history of monitoring First Amendment activity, has witnessed a notable change in police treatment of political protesters since the November 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. At subsequent gatherings in Washington, D.C., Detroit, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, and Portland a pattern of behavior that stifles First Amendment rights has emerged&quot;. In a subsequent lawsuit, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that &quot;It was lawful for the city of Seattle to deem part of downtown off-limits ... But the court also said that police enforcing the rule may have gone too far by targeting only those opposed to the WTO, in violation of their First Amendment rights.&quot;

When then-President George W Bush came to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Labor Day, 2002, for a speech, the local police, acting on the request of the Secret Service, erected chain-link fence on a baseball field a third of a mile from the speech site, and proclaimed it a &quot;designated free-speech zone.&quot;

Free speech zones were used in Boston at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. The free speech zones organized by the authorities in Boston were boxed in by concrete walls, invisible to the FleetCenter where the convention was held and criticized harshly as a &quot;protest pen&quot; or &quot;Boston&#x27;s Camp X-Ray&quot;. &quot;Some protesters for a short time Monday [July 26, 2004] converted the zone into a mock prison camp by donning hoods and marching in the cage with their hands behind their backs.&quot; A coalition of groups protesting the Iraq War challenged the planned protest zones. U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Woodlock was sympathetic to their request: &quot;One cannot conceive of what other design elements could be put into a space to create a more symbolic affront to the role of free expression.&quot;. However, he ultimately rejected the petition to move the protest zones closer to the FleetCenter.

Free speech zones were also used in New York City at the 2004 Republican National Convention. According to Mike McGuire, a columnist for the online anti-war magazine &quot;Nonviolent Activist&quot;, &quot;The policing of the protests during the 2004 Republican National Convention represent[ed] another interesting model of repression. The NYPD tracked every planned action and set up traps. As marches began, police would emerge from their hiding places – building vestibules, parking garages, or vans – and corral the dissenters with orange netting that read &#x27;POLICE LINE – DO &quot;not&quot; CROSS,&#x27; establishing areas they ironically called &#x27;ad-hoc free speech zones.&#x27; One by one, protesters were arrested and detained – some for nearly two days.&quot; Both the Democratic and Republican National parties were jointly awarded a 2005 Jefferson Muzzle from the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression, &quot;For their mutual failure to make the preservation of First Amendment freedoms a priority during the last Presidential election&quot;.

Free speech zones were commonly used by President George W. Bush after the September 11 attacks and through the 2004 election. Free speech zones were set up by the Secret Service, who scouted locations where the U.S. president was scheduled to speak, or pass through. Officials targeted those who carried anti-Bush signs and escorted them to the free speech zones prior to and during the event. Reporters were often barred by local officials from displaying these protesters on camera or speaking to them within the zone. Protesters who refused to go to the free speech zone were often arrested and charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct and/or resisting arrest. A seldom-used federal law making it unlawful to &quot;willfully and knowingly to enter or remain in ... any posted, cordoned off, or otherwise restricted area of a building or grounds where the President or other person protected by the Secret Service is or will be temporarily visiting&quot; has also been invoked.

==Criticisms==
Civil liberties advocates argue that free speech zones are used as a form of censorship and public relations management to conceal the existence of popular opposition from the mass public and elected officials. There is much controversy surrounding the creation of these areas – the mere existence of such zones is offensive to some people, who maintain that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution makes the entire country an unrestricted free speech zone. The Department of Homeland Security &quot;has even gone so far as to tell local police departments to regard critics of the War on Terrorism as potential terrorists themselves.&quot;

The Bush administration has been criticized by columnist James Bovard of &quot;The American Conservative&quot; for requiring protesters to stay within a designated area, while allowing supporters access to more areas. According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the American Civil Liberties Union has asked a federal court in Washington, D.C. to prevent the Secret Service from keeping anti-Bush protesters distant from presidential appearances while allowing supporters to display their messages up close, where they are likely to be seen by the news media.

The preliminary plan for the 2004 Democratic National Convention was criticized by the National Lawyers Guild and the ACLU of Massachusetts as being insufficient to handle the size of the expected protest. &quot;The zone would hold as few as 400 of the several thousand protesters who are expected in Boston in late July.&quot;

==Notable incidents and court proceedings==
In 1939, the United States Supreme Court found in &quot;Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization&quot; that public streets and parks &quot;have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.&quot; In the later &quot;Thornhill v. Alabama&quot; case, the court found that picketing and marching in public areas is protected by the United States Constitution as free speech. However, subsequent rulings – &quot;Edwards v. South Carolina&quot;, &quot;Brown v. Louisiana&quot;, &quot;Cox v. Louisiana&quot;, and &quot;Adderley v. Florida&quot; – found that picketing is afforded less protection than pure speech due to the physical externalities it creates. Regulations on demonstrations may affect the time, place, and manner of those demonstrations, but may not discriminate based on the content of the demonstration.

The Secret Service denied targeting the president&#x27;s political opponents. &quot;Decisions made in the formulation of a security plan are based on security considerations, not political considerations&quot;, said one Secret Service spokesman.

===Bill Neel===
&quot;These [free speech] zones routinely succeed in keeping protesters out of presidential sight and outside the view of media covering the event. When Bush came to the Pittsburgh area on Labor Day 2002, 65-year-old retired steel worker Bill Neel was there to greet him with a sign proclaiming, &#x27;The Bush family must surely love the poor, they made so many of us.&#x27; The local police, at the Secret Service&#x27;s behest, set up a &#x27;designated free-speech zone&#x27; on a baseball field surrounded by a chain-link fence a third of a mile from the location of Bush&#x27;s speech. The police cleared the path of the motorcade of all critical signs, though folks with pro-Bush signs were permitted to line the president&#x27;s path. Neel refused to go to the designated area and was arrested for disorderly conduct. Police detective John Ianachione testified that the Secret Service told local police to confine &#x27;people that were there making a statement pretty much against the president and his views.&#x27;&quot; District judge Shirley Trkula threw out the charges, stating that &quot;I believe this is America. Whatever happened to &#x27;I don&#x27;t agree with you, but I&#x27;ll defend to the death your right to say it&#x27;?&quot;

===Brett Bursey===
At another incident during a presidential visit to South Carolina, protester Brett Bursey refused an order by Secret Service agents to go to a free speech zone half-a-mile away. He was arrested and charged with trespassing by the South Carolina police. &quot;Bursey said that he asked the policeman if &#x27;it was the content of my sign,&#x27; and he said, &#x27;Yes, sir, it&#x27;s the content of your sign that&#x27;s the problem.&#x27;&quot; However, the prosecution, led by James Strom Thurmond Jr., disputes Bursey&#x27;s version of events. Trespassing charges against Bursey were dropped, and Bursey was instead indicted by the federal government for violation of a federal law that allows the Secret Service to restrict access to areas visited by the president. Bursey faced up to six months in prison and a US$5,000 fine. After a bench trial, Bursey was convicted of the offense of trespassing, but judge Bristow Marchant deemed the offense to be relatively minor and ordered a fine of $500 be assessed, which Bursey appealed, and lost. In his ruling, Marchant found that &quot;this is not to say that the Secret Service&#x27;s power to restrict the area around the President is absolute, nor does the Court find that protesters are required to go to a designated demonstration area – which was an issue in this case – as long as they do not otherwise remain in a properly restricted area.&quot;

Marchant&#x27;s ruling however, was criticized for three reasons:
* The ruling found that Bursey was not the victim of selective prosecution because Bursey was the only person who had refused an order to leave the area. However, this overlooks the fact that nobody else refused to leave the zone because nobody else was asked to leave.
* The prosecution claimed that the protected zone around the President was 100 yards wide. However, it was unmarked, with cars and trucks allowed to pass through and drop off ticket-holders, and nobody was willing to tell protesters where the zone&#x27;s boundaries were. Marchant&#x27;s decision noted this but did not find this unreasonable.
* Marchant found that in the &quot;age of suicide bombers&quot;, the Secret Service should have latitude to get rid of anyone suspicious who is standing near the president&#x27;s route. However, given that the reason Bursey was singled out by the Secret Service was his sign, &quot;it&#x27;s enough to make anyone with a dissenting view think twice before deciding to stand out from a crowd.&quot;

===ACLU litigation===
In 2003, the ACLU brought a lawsuit against the Secret Service, &quot;ACORN v. Secret Service&quot;, representing the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). &quot;The federal court in Philadelphia dismissed that case in March [2004] after the Secret Service acknowledged that it could not discriminate against protesters through the use of out-of-sight, out-of-earshot protest zones.&quot; Another 2003 lawsuit against the city of Philadelphia, &quot;ACORN v. Philadelphia&quot;, charged that the Philadelphia Police Department, on orders from the Secret Service, had kept protesters &quot;further away from the site of presidential visits than Administration supporters. A high-ranking official of the Philadelphia police told ACLU of Pennsylvania Legal Director Stefan Presser that he was only following Secret Service orders.&quot; However, the court found the ACLU lacked standing to bring the case and dismissed it.

The Secret Service says it does establish &#x27;public viewing areas&#x27; to protect dignitaries but does not discriminate against individuals based on the content of their signs or speech. &#x27;Absolutely not,&#x27; said Tom Mazur, a spokesman for the agency created to protect the president. &#x27;The Secret Service makes no distinction on the purpose, message or intent of any individual or group.&#x27; Civil libertarians dispute that. They cite a Corpus Christi, Texas, couple, Jeff and Nicole Rank, as an example. The two were arrested at a Bush campaign event in Charleston, West Virginia, on July 4, 2004, when they refused to take off anti-Bush shirts. Their shirts read, &#x27;Love America, Hate Bush&#x27; ... The ACLU found 17 cases since March 2001 in which protesters were removed during events where the president or vice president appeared. And lawyers say it&#x27;s an increasing trend. 

According to Jeff Rank, Nicole Rank&#x27;s shirt did say &quot;Love America, Hate Bush&quot; while Jeff Rank&#x27;s shirt said &quot;Regime change starts at home.&quot;

The incident occurred several months after the Secret Service&#x27;s pledge in &quot;ACORN v. Secret Service&quot; not to discriminate against protesters. &quot;The charges against the Ranks were ultimately dismissed in court and the mayor and city council publicly apologized for the arrest. City officials also said that local law enforcement was acting at the request of Secret Service.&quot; ACLU Senior Staff Attorney Chris Hansen pointed out that &quot;The Secret Service has promised to not curtail the right to dissent at presidential appearances, and yet we are still hearing stories of people being blocked from engaging in lawful protest&quot;, said Hansen. &quot;It is time for the Secret Service to stop making empty promises.&quot; The Ranks subsequently filed a lawsuit, &quot;Rank v. Jenkins&quot;, against Deputy Assistant to the President Gregory Jenkins and the Secret Service. &quot;The lawsuit, &quot;Rank v. Jenkins&quot;, is seeking unspecified damages as well as a declaration that the actions leading to the removal of the Ranks from the Capitol grounds were unconstitutional.&quot; In August 2007, the Ranks settled their lawsuit against the Federal Government. The government paid them $80,000, but made no admission of wrongdoing. The Ranks&#x27; case against Gregory Jenkins is still pending in the District of Columbia.

As a result of ACLU subpoenas during the discovery in the &quot;Rank&quot; lawsuit, the ACLU obtained the White House&#x27;s previously classified presidential advance manual. The manual gives people organizing presidential visits specific advice for preventing or obstructing protests. &quot;There are several ways the advance person&quot; – the person organizing the presidential visit – &quot;can prepare a site to minimize demonstrators. First, as always, work with the Secret Service to and have them ask the local police department to designate a protest area where demonstrators can be placed, preferably not in view of the event site or motorcade route. The formation of &#x27;rally squads&#x27; is a common way to prepare for demonstrators ... The rally squad&#x27;s task is to use their signs and banners as shields between the demonstrators and the main press platform ... As a last resort, security should remove the demonstrators from the event site.&quot;

==College and university campuses==
The use of free speech zones on university campuses is controversial. Many universities created on-campus free speech zones during the 1960s and 1970s, during which protests on-campus (especially against the Vietnam War) were common. Generally, the requirements are that the university is given advance notice and that they are held in locations that do not disrupt classes.

In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District&quot; that non-disruptive speech is permitted in public schools. However, this does not apply to private universities. In September 2004, U.S. District Court Judge Sam Cummings struck down the free-speech-zone policy at Texas Tech University.

According to the opinion of the court, campus areas such as parks, sidewalks, streets and other areas are designated as public forums, regardless of whether the university has chosen to officially designate the areas as such. The university may open more of the campus as public forums for its students, but it cannot designate fewer areas ... Not all places within the boundaries of the campus are public forums, according to Cummings&#x27; opinion. The court declared the university&#x27;s policy unconstitutional to the extent that it regulates the content of student speech in areas of the campus that are public forums.

In 2007, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education released a survey of 346 colleges and Universities in the United States. Of those institutions, 259 (75%) maintain policies that &quot;both clearly and
substantially restrict freedom of speech.&quot;

In December 2005, the College Libertarians at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro staged a protest outside the university&#x27;s designated protest zones. The specific intent of the protest was to provoke just such a charge, to &quot;provoke the system into action into a critical review of what&#x27;s going on.&quot; Two students, Allison Jaynes and Robert Sinnott, were brought up on charges under the student code of conduct of &quot;violation of respect&quot;, for refusing to move when told to do so by a university official. The university subsequently dropped honor code charges against the students. &quot;University officials said the history of the free-speech zones is not known. &#x27;It predated just about everybody here&quot;, said Lucien &#x27;Skip&#x27; Capone III, the university attorney. The policy may be a holdover from the Vietnam War and civil rights era, he said.&#x27;&quot;

A number of colleges and universities have revised or revoked free speech zone policies in the last decade, including: Tufts University, Appalachian State University, and West Virginia University. In August 2006, Penn State University revised its seven-year-old rules restricting the rights of students to protest. &quot;In effect, the whole campus is now a &#x27;free-speech zone.&#x27;&quot;

Controversies have also occurred at the University of Southern California, Indiana University, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and Brigham Young University.

At Marquette University, an unattributed Dave Barry quote was attached to the door of the office that graduate student Stuart Ditsler shared with three other teaching assistants. It read, &quot;As Americans we must always remember that we all have a common enemy, an enemy that is dangerous, powerful, and relentless. I refer, of course, to the federal government.&quot; Philosophy department chairman James South ordered Ditsler to remove the quote, calling it patently offensive. South claimed that the university&#x27;s free-speech zone rules required Ditsler to take it down. University spokeswoman Brigid O&#x27;Brien Miller stated that it was &quot;a workplace issue, not one of academic freedom.&quot; Ultimately, the quote was allowed to remain, albeit with attribution.

For example, the Louisiana State University Free Speech Alley (or Free Speech Plaza) was used in November 2015 when Louisiana gubernatorial candidate John Bel Edwards was publicly endorsed by former opponent and Republican Lt. Governor Jay Dardenne. The Consuming Fire Fellowship, a church located in rural Woodville, Mississippi, often sends members to convene at the university&#x27;s Free Speech Alley to preach their views of Christianity. The members have often been met with strong resistance and resentment by the student body. Ivan Imes, a retired engineer who holds &quot;Jesus Talks&quot; for students at the university, said in an interview that he advised students frustrated with the preachings of the Consuming Fire Fellowship, &quot;to give the church a break. They don&#x27;t understand love. They don&#x27;t understand forgiveness. There are a lot of things in the Bible that they don’t understand, or at least don’t live out.&quot;

, four states had passed legislation outlawing public colleges and universities from establishing free speech zones. The first state to do so was Virginia in 2014, followed by Missouri in 2015, Arizona in 2016, and Kentucky in 2017.

==Other countries==
Designated protest areas were established during the August 2007 Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America Summit in Ottawa, Canada. Although use of the areas was voluntary and not surrounded by fences, some protesters decried the use of designated protest areas, calling them &quot;protest pens.&quot;

During the 2005 WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Conference, over 10,000 protesters were present. Wan Chai Sports Ground and Wan Chai Cargo Handling Basin were designated as protest zones. Police wielded sticks, used gas grenades and shot rubber bullets at some of the protesters. They arrested 910 people, 14 were charged, but none were convicted.

Three protest parks were designated in Beijing during the 2008 Summer Olympics, at the suggestion of the IOC. All 77 applications to protest there were withdrawn or denied, and no protests took place. Four people who applied to protest were arrested or sentenced to &quot;re-education through labor&quot;.

In the Philippines, public spaces that are designated as free speech zones are called freedom parks.

<text>Gharyan District or Garian District () was one of the districts of Libya. It was located in the northwest part of the country and its capital was Gharyan. Under the 2007 reorganization of districts, it became part of Jabal al Gharbi District.

Gharyan District was governed by a district congress which had ten committees that conducted day-to-day management and oversight. Those committees were: Marine resources; Manpower, Employment and Training; Planning; Justice; Economy and Trade; Tourism; Public Security; Agriculture and Livestock; Industry, Mines and Energy; and Housing and Utilities.

==Boundaries==
Prior to 2007 Gharyan bordered the following districts:
*Jafara - north

*Bani Walid - southeast, at a quadripoint
*Mizda - south
*Yafran - west

==Attractions and communities==

<doc id="469553" wikidata="Q5326319" url="?curid=469553" title="Earl of Lovelace">
<text>Earl of Lovelace was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1838 for William King-Noel, 8th Baron King, a title created in 1725.

==History==
The King or Locke King family stems from the only known child of Jerome King, a grocer, of Exeter, and his wife Anne, first cousin of the leading philosopher of quite low birth, John Locke. This child was Sir Peter King, a prominent lawyer and politician who served as Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas from 1714 to 1725, and as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1725 to 1733; as such, in 1725 he was created Baron King of Ockham in the County of Surrey, in the Peerage of Great Britain (verbally and less formally Lord King). The estate he bought was chosen as his territorial designation.

He was succeeded by his eldest son (the second Baron) who represented Launceston and Exeter in the House of Commons but died aged 34. His three younger brothers—Peter, William and Thomas—all succeeded in the barony. Thomas was succeeded by his son, the sixth Baron, whose son, the seventh Baron, was a Whig politician and writer. On his death in 1833, the title passed to his eldest son, the eighth Baron.

In 1835, the eighth Baron married as his first wife the Hon. (Augusta) Ada Byron, the only daughter of the poet Lord Byron and his wife 11th Baroness Wentworth ( Anne Isabella Milbanke), who was a descendant of the extinct Barons Lovelace. In 1838 the eighth Baron was created Viscount Ockham (territorial designation the same, to be the family&#x27;s first courtesy title), and Earl of Lovelace in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was appointed the Lord-Lieutenant of Surrey from 1840 to 1893. Ada died in 1852, leaving her husband, in his forties, a widower. In 1860, he assumed for himself by Royal licence the additional surname and arms of Noel, those of Wentworth. In 1865 he remarried, to Jane Crawford Jenkins and had one child, who would eventually inherit the earldom. Lord Lovelace acquired Horsley Towers (now a hotel) in East Horsley and was patron of the parish church funding the rebuilding of the chancel and the nave in 1869. He also rebuilt the wall of the churchyard which included a number of architectural features such as the gazebo and its family crest-engraved walls. He planned for his death 20 years before he died when work began on building his mausoleum in another corner of the churchyard. The mausoleum, which has recently been restored, contains his tomb and that of his second wife. His eldest son Byron, Viscount Ockham, briefly succeeded his maternal grandmother to become the 12th Baron Wentworth according to its special remainder in 1860. However, he predeceased his father, unmarried, two years later.

At his death in 1893, the 1st Earl of Lovelace was succeeded by his second son Ralph (1839–1906), who was then already the 13th Baron Wentworth. In 1861, Ralph had assumed by Royal licence the surname of &quot;Milbanke&quot; in lieu of &quot;Noel&quot;.

The 2nd Earl of Lovelace had no sons and was succeeded in the barony of Wentworth by his only child, Ada King-Milbanke, 14th Baroness Wentworth. His other titles passed to his half-brother Lionel (1865–1929), the 3rd Earl.

In 1895, the 3rd Earl of Lovelace had received for himself only Royal licence to use the additional surname and arms of Noel, but resumed by Royal licence, in 1908, the surname and arms of King only for himself and his children. He served in the First World War as a Major in the Northumberland Fusiliers and as a staff-Captain.

The titles were finally held by his grandson, the 5th Earl (1951–2018), who succeeded his father in 1964 and died in 2018. As there were no heirs to the earldom of Lovelace, to the viscountcy of Ockham and to the barony of King of Ockham, these all became extinct at his death.

==Family seats==
The family seat following its purchase by the 1st Lord King was Ockham Park, Ockham, Surrey until the fine Jacobean house was reduced to outbuildings in a fire in 1948. The family then moved its main home to Torridon House, near Torridon in Ross-shire.

After the 1st Baron King&#x27;s death in 1734, the King Chapel was added to All Saints&#x27; Church, Ockham, intended as a chapel over the family vault of the Lords King and their descendants.
The traditional burial place of the Earls of Lovelace was at Martin&#x27;s Church, East Horsley. The 1st Earl is buried in a mausoleum in a corner of the churchyard, the 2nd Earl was cremated at Woking Crematorium (his ashes are buried in the King Chapel of All Saints&#x27; Church, Ockham), while the 3rd Earl and his wife Edith († 1932), the 4th Earl and his wife Doris († 1940) as well as the Lovelace daughters Lady Diana de Hosszu († 1955) and Lady Penelope Allen († 1947) rest in the churchyard of Martin&#x27;s, where the &quot;Lovelace Plot&quot; was set apart for “myself, my heirs and (...) the exclusive right in perpetuity of burial and placing monuments and gravestones” by the 3rd Earl in 1909.

==Notable family members==

===Notable wives===
Ada Lovelace, the 1st Earl&#x27;s first wife, was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage&#x27;s early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Because of this, she is often described as the world&#x27;s first computer programmer.

===Notable younger sons and their sons===
The Hon. Peter King, second son of the seventh Lord King (and brother of the first Earl of Lovelace), was a long-serving progressive politician who bought Brooklands and the father of Hugh F. Locke King, the entrepreneur who transformed it into a pioneering racetrack and aviation centre from the year 1906 onwards.

The family had no male heirs, nor female who married a celebrity. Hugh died without children in 1926 and his elder brother Peter died in middle age in 1885 in Aston without sons. Hugh&#x27;s large Brooklands estate became Brooklands College, Brooklands Museum, a hotel, Mercedes Benz World, paths through greens, skateboarding and playground spaces and Brooklands distribution/retail park. A small part has become housing, having addresses with motor history names.

<doc id="469554" wikidata="Q337310" url="?curid=469554" title="Academy of Ancient Music">
<text>The Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) is a British period-instrument orchestra based in Cambridge, England. Founded by harpsichordist Christopher Hogwood in 1973, it was named after an 18th-century organisation of the same name (originally the Academy of Vocal Music). The musicians play on either original instruments from the period when the music was composed or modern copies of such instruments. They generally play Baroque, Classical, and sometimes Romantic music, although they have also played some new compositions for baroque orchestra in recent years.

==Original organisation==

The original Academy of Vocal Music was founded in London, England in 1725/26 (the Gregorian date of the inaugural meeting was 1 February 1726). Records of the purpose of the academy no longer exist, but according to John Hawkins in 1770, it was intended to &quot;promote the study and practice of vocal and instrumental harmony&quot;. From the beginning, Agostino Steffani was elected honorary president for life.

In 1731 it was renamed the Academy of Ancient Music, and continued to grow in membership, including the composers William Croft, Michael Christian Festing, Maurice Greene, Bernard Gates, Giovanni Bononcini, Senesino, Nicola Haym, Francesco Geminiani, Pier Francesco Tosi, John Ernest Galliard, Charles Dieupart, Jean-Baptiste Loeillet and Giuseppe Riva. George Frideric Handel was never a member, although the society studied and performed his music as well as their own, and that of other composers of the day. Directors of the organisation included Johann Christoph Pepusch (from 1735 onwards), Benjamin Cooke and Samuel Arnold (from 1789 onwards).

H. D. Johnstone called the Academy of Ancient Music &quot;the most famous and influential institution of its kind in eighteenth-century London&quot;.

==Modern revival==

In 1973, the Academy of Ancient Music was revived by the British conductor and harpsichordist, Christopher Hogwood, for the purpose of playing 18th- and early 19th-century music on period instruments. For choral works, it is joined by the Academy of Ancient Music Chorus or by other external choruses.

The AAM was the first orchestra to record all of Mozart&#x27;s symphonies on period instruments. The AAM has since recorded the complete Mozart&#x27;s piano concertos, with fortepianist Robert Levin, the complete Beethoven&#x27;s piano concertos, with fortepianist Steven Lubin, and symphonies, and has recorded numerous Haydn&#x27;s symphonies. The AAM has also recorded Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Orlando&quot; and &quot;Rinaldo&quot;, Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, Haydn&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;anima del filosofo&quot; and over 200 other recordings for a range of different labels.

The commissioning of new works under Paul Goodwin represented a new development for the AAM. The first commission and recording, John Tavener&#x27;s &quot;Eternity&#x27;s Sunrise&quot;, met with enthusiastic critical acclaim and led to a second new Tavener work and recording, &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;. David Bedford&#x27;s &quot;Like a Strand of Scarlet&quot; followed in 2001 and, in 2003, the AAM premiered John Woolrich&#x27;s &quot;Arcangelo&quot;, written to mark the 350th anniversary of the birth of Arcangelo Corelli. The next commission in 2006 celebrated the 250th anniversary of Mozart&#x27;s birth with a work from the Scottish-American composer Thea Musgrave, &quot;Journey into Light&quot;, which was written as a companion piece to Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Exsultate, jubilate&quot;. Recently, this trend has been revived with commissioning the harpsichordist, conductor, and scholar Mahan Esfahani to write a new orchestration of Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;, which was premiered at the BBC Proms in July 2012.

Both Tavener recordings are on Harmonia Mundi (France), for whom the AAM has made a large number of CDs: Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Zaïde&quot; and Christmas music by Schütz and his contemporaries (conducted by Paul Goodwin); violin concertos by J.S. Bach and Vivaldi; and concerti grossi by Handel and Geminiani (directed by Andrew Manze); and Bach&#x27;s harpsichord concertos (played by Richard Egarr). Choral recordings include works by Bach, Handel, Purcell and Vivaldi, with King&#x27;s College Choir under Stephen Cleobury, and several recordings with Edward Higginbottom and New College Choir, including Pergolesi&#x27;s &quot;Marian Vespers&quot; and Handel&#x27;s coronation anthems, a collection of music from 17th and 18th-century English coronations. With Richard Egarr, the orchestra has released Handel&#x27;s instrumental music Opp. 1–7, as well as Bach&#x27;s four orchestral suites and his &quot;St John Passion&quot;. 

In 2013, the orchestra announced the opening of its own record label, the AAM Records, whose first album was released in October of the same year.

The AAM is Orchestra-in-Residence at the University of Cambridge. In January 2020, the Teatro San Cassiano announced that the AAM is to become its first associate ensemble.

==Leadership==
In 1996, the AAM appointed Paul Goodwin as associate conductor and Andrew Manze as associate director under Hogwood. In 2003, Manze resigned as associate director, to be replaced in 2005 by Richard Egarr. On 1 September 2006, Egarr succeeded Hogwood as music director of the AAM and Hogwood received the title of emeritus director. Egarr concluded his tenure as AAM music director at the close of the 2020–2021 season. In November 2020, the AAM announced the appointment of Laurence Cummings as its next music director, effective with the 2021–2022 season.

Past general managers and chief executives of the AAM have included Heather Jarman, Paul Hughes, Christopher Lawrence, Peter Ansell, Michael Garvey, Jonathan Manners, Ed Hossack and Alexander Van Ingen. In June 2020, the AAM announced the appointment of John McMunn as its next chief executive, effective 1 September 2020.

<doc id="469555" wikidata="Q828578" url="?curid=469555" title="Muisca">
<text>The Muisca (also called the Chibcha) are an Indigenous people and culture of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense of Colombia, that formed the Muisca Confederation before the Spanish invasion. The people speak Muysccubun, a language of the Chibchan language family, also called &quot;Muysca&quot; and &quot;Mosca&quot;. The first known contact with Europeans were Spaniards in 1537 during the conquest. During the colonial era, Spanish clerics and civil officials had a major impact on them, attempting to Christianize and incorporate them into the Spanish Empire as subjects. Postconquest Muisca culture underwent significant changes under the impact of the Spanish invasion and establishment of the New Kingdom of Granada. Sources for the Muisca are far less abundant than for the Aztec Empire of Mesoamerica or the Inca Empire and their incorporation to the Spanish Empire during the colonial era. In the New Kingdom if Granada and into the colonial era, the Muisca became &quot;the official &#x27;tribe&#x27; of the Colombian nation&quot; and &quot;a local version of the Aztecs and Incas&quot;. Recent scholarship on the Muisca by archeologists, anthropologists, and historians is revising the understanding of the Muiscas&#x27; prehispanic and colonial era past.

== History of the Muisca ==
Subgroupings were identified chiefly by their allegiances to three great Muisca rulers: the &quot;hoa&quot; in Hunza, ruling a territory roughly covering modern southern and northeastern Boyacá and southern Santander; the &quot;psihipqua&quot; in Muyquytá and encompassing most of modern Cundinamarca, the western Llanos; and the &quot;iraca&quot;, religious ruler of Suamox and modern northeastern Boyacá and southwestern Santander.

The territory of the Muisca spanned an area of around from the north of Boyacá to the Sumapaz Páramo and from the summits to the western portion of the Eastern Ranges. Their territory bordered the lands of the Panche in the west, the Muzo in the northwest, the Guane in the north, the Lache in the northeast, the Achagua in the east, and the Sutagao in the south.

At the time of the Spaniard invasion, the area had a large population, although the precise number of inhabitants is not known. Estimates vary from 1 million to over 3 million inhabitants. Their economy was based on agriculture, salt mining, trading, metalworking, and manufacturing.

Due to Spanish colonization, the population of the Muisca drastically decreased and assimilated into the general population. The descendants of the Muisca are often found in rural municipalities including Cota, Chía, Tenjo, Suba, Engativá, Tocancipá, Gachancipá, and Ubaté. A census by the Ministry of Interior Affairs in 2005 reports a total of 14,051 Muisca people in Colombia.

Much of the historical knowledge about the Muisca comes from the testimonies of conquistadors and colonists Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada; Spanish poet, soldier, and priest Juan de Castellanos (16th century); bishop Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita and Franciscan Pedro Simón (17th century). 

More recently, Javier Ocampo López and Gonzalo Correal Urrego have contributed notable scholarship.
Knowledge of events up until 1450 is mainly derived from mythological contexts. Thanks to the &quot;Chronicles of the West Indies,&quot; we have descriptions of the final period of Muisca&#x27;s history before the Spanish arrival.

=== Archeology ===
Excavations in the Altiplano Cundiboyacense (the highlands of Cundinamarca and Boyacá departments) show evidence of human activity since the Archaic Period at the beginning of the Holocene. Colombia has one of the most ancient archaeological sites of the Americas: El Abra, which is estimated to be approximately 13,000 years old. Other archaeological traces in the region of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense have led scholars to talk about an El Abra Culture: In Tibitó, tools and other lithic artifacts date to 9740 BCE; on the Bogotá savanna, especially at Tequendama Falls, other lithic tools dated a millennium later were found that belonged to specialized hunters. Human skeletons were found dating back to 5000 BCE, and an analysis demonstrated that the people were members of the El Abra culture.

=== Muisca era ===
Scholars agree that the group identified as Muisca migrated to the Altiplano Cundiboyacense in the Formative stage (between 1000 BCE and 500 CE), as shown by evidence found at Aguazuque and Soacha. Like the other formative-era cultures of America, the Muiscas were transitioning between being hunter-gatherers and becoming sedentary farmers. Around 1500 BCE, groups of agrarians with ceramic traditions came to the region from the lowlands. They had permanent housing and stationary camps, and worked the salty water to extract salt. In Zipacón, there is evidence of agriculture and ceramics; the oldest settlement of the highlands dates to 1270 BCE. Between 800 BCE and 500 BCE, a second wave of migrants came to the highlands. Their presence is identified by multicolor ceramics, housing, and farms. These groups were still in residence upon the arrival of the Spanish invaders. They left abundant traces of their occupation that have been studied since the 16th century, allowing scientists to reconstruct their way of life. The Muisca may have integrated with more ancient inhabitants, but the Muisca were the ones who molded the cultural profile and the social and political organization. Their language, a dialect of Chibcha, was very similar to those peoples of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Kogi, Ijka, Wiwa, and Kankuamo) and the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy (U&#x27;wa).

==== Wars ====

&quot;Zipa&quot; Saguamanchica (ruled 1470 to 1490) was in a constant war against aggressive tribes such as the Sutagao, and especially the Panche, who would also make difficulties for his successors, Nemequene and Tisquesusa. Kalina Caribs were also a permanent threat as rivals of the &quot;zaque&quot; of Hunza, especially for the possession of the salt mines of Zipaquirá, Nemocón and Tausa.

== Political and administrative organization ==
The Muisca people were organized in a confederation that was a loose union of polities that each retained sovereignty. The confederation was not a kingdom, as there was no absolute monarch, nor was it an empire, because it did not dominate other ethnic groups or peoples. It is hard to compare the Muisca Confederation with other American civilizations, such as the Aztec or the Inca empires as it was more similar to a confederation of states, such as the Achaean League. The Muisca Confederation was one of the biggest and best-organized confederations of tribes on the South American continent.

Every tribe within the confederation was ruled by a chief or a cacique. Most of the tribes were part of the Muisca ethnic group, sharing the same language and culture and forming relations through trade. They united in the face of a common enemy. The army was the responsibility of the &quot;zipa&quot; or &quot;zaque&quot;. Güeches, the traditional ancient warriors of the Muisca, made up the military.

The Muisca Confederation existed as the union of two lesser confederations. The southern confederation, headed by the &quot;zipa&quot;, had its capital at Bacatá (now Bogotá). This southern polity included most of the Muisca population and held greater economic power.

The northern territory was ruled by the &quot;zaque&quot;, and had its capital in Hunza, known today as Tunja. Although both areas had common political relations and affinities and belonged to the same tribal nation, rivalries still existed between them. Among the territories there were four chiefdoms: Bacatá, Hunza, Duitama, and Sogamoso. The chiefdom was composed by localities. The tribes were divided into &quot;Capitanías&quot; (ruled by a capitan). There were two kinds: &quot;Great Capitania&quot; (&quot;sybyn&quot;) and &quot;Minor Capitania&quot; (&quot;uta&quot;). The status of &quot;Capitan&quot; was inherited by maternal lineage.

Muisca legislation was customary law; that is, their rule of law was determined by long-extant customs with the approval of the &quot;zip&quot; or &quot;zaque&quot;. This kind of legislation was suitable for a well-organized confederation system. Natural resources could not be privatized: woods, lakes, plateaus, rivers, and other natural resources were common goods.

== Language ==

&quot;Chibcha&quot;, also known as &quot;muysca&quot;, &quot;mosca&quot;, or &quot;muysca cubun&quot;, belongs to the Chibchan languages. At the height of its expanse, the language was spoken across several regions of Central America and the north of South America. The Tairona culture and the U&#x27;wa, related to the Muisca culture, speak similar languages, which encouraged trade. The Muisca used a form of hieroglyphs for numbers.

Many Chibcha words were absorbed or &quot;loaned&quot; into Colombian Spanish:
* Geography: Many names of localities and regions were kept. In some cases, the Spanish named cities with a combination of Chibcha and Spanish words, such as Santa Fe de Bogotá (Chibcha: &quot;Bacatá&quot;). Most of the municipalities of the Boyacá and Cundinamarca departments are derived from Chibcha names: Chocontá, Sogamoso, Zipaquirá, and many others.
* Fruits, such as curuba and uchuva.
* Relations: the youngest child is called &quot;cuba&quot;, or &quot;china&quot; for a girl; &quot;muysca&quot; means people.

== Economy ==

The Muisca had an economy and society considered to have been one of the most powerful of the American Post-Classic stage, mainly because of the precious resources of the area: gold and emeralds. When the Spaniards arrived in Muisca territory, they found a prosperous state, with the Muisca Confederation controlling the mining of the following products:
* emeralds: Colombia is the primary producer of emeralds in the world
* copper
* coal: the coal mines still operate today at Zipaquirá and other sites. Colombia has some of the world&#x27;s most significant coal reserves.
* salt: there were mines in production at Nemocón, Zipaquirá, and Tausa
* gold: gold was imported from other regions but was so abundant that it became a preferred material for Muisca handicrafts. The many handicraft works in gold and the &quot;zipa&quot; tradition of offering gold to the goddess Guatavita contributed to the legend of &quot;El Dorado&quot;.

The Muisca traded their goods at local and regional markets with a system of barter. Items traded ranged from basic necessities to luxury goods. The abundance of salt, emeralds, and coal brought these commodities to &quot;de facto&quot; currency status.

Having developed an agrarian society, the people used terrace farming and irrigation in the highlands. Main products were fruits, coca, quinoa, yuca and potatoes.

Another major economic activity was weaving. The people made a wide variety of complex textiles. Scholar Paul Bahn said, &quot;The Andean cultures mastered almost every method of textile weaving or decoration now known, and their products were often finer than those of today.&quot;


== Culture ==

The Muisca were an agrarian and ceramic society of the Andes of the north of South America. Their political and administrative organization enabled them to form a compact cultural unity with great discipline.

The contributions of the Muisca culture to the Colombian national identity have been many.

=== Heraldry ===
Pre-Columbian Muisca patterns appear in various seals of modern municipalities located on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, for instance Sopó and Guatavita, Cundinamarca. The remaining Muisca people in central Colombia also have their own seal.

=== Sports ===
The Muisca culture had certain sports which were part of their rituals. The &quot;turmequé&quot; game, also known as tejo, has survived and became a popular sport of Colombia. Also important were matches of wrestling. The winner received a finely woven cotton blanket from the chief and was qualified as a guecha warrior.

=== Religion ===

Recent scholarship on the Muisca contends that Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita&#x27;s 1688 &quot;Historia general&quot; of New Granada, has unduly shaped understandings of Muisca religion, saying that it was &quot;full of confident assertions concerning a Muisca &#x27;religion&#x27; with a pantheon of deities, creation stories, and visions of the afterlife, led from great temples by high priests -- some of whom were pictured, at great expense, in three richly illustrated pages that accompanied his book.&quot;

Muisca priests were educated from childhood and led the main religious ceremonies. Only the priests could enter the temples. Besides the religious activities, the priests had much influence in the lives of the people, giving counsel in matters of farming or war. The religion originally included human sacrifice, but the practice may have been extinct by the time of the Spanish conquest, as there are no first-hand Spanish accounts.

Oral tradition suggests that every family gave up a child for sacrifice, that the children were regarded as sacred and cared for until the age of 15, when their lives were then offered to the Sun-god, Sué.

==== Deities ====
* Sué, Suá, Zuhé or Xué (The Sun god): he is the father of the Muisca. His temple was in Suamox, the sacred city of the Sun. He was the most venerated god, especially by the Confederation of the &quot;zaque&quot;, who was considered his descendant. &quot;was &quot;full of confident assertions and visions of he afterlife, led from great temples by high priest --some of whom were pictured, at great expensse, in three richly illustrated title pages that accompied his book&quot;
* Chía (The Moon-goddess): her temple was in what is today the municipality of Chía. She was widely worshipped by the Confederation of the &quot;zipa&quot;, who was considered her son.
* Bochica: though not properly a god, he enjoyed the same status as one. He was a chief or hero eternized in the oral tradition. The land was flooded by a goddess, a beautiful and sometimes mean woman, or by Chibchacum, protector of the farmers. Bochica listened to the complaints of the Muisca about floods. With his stick, he broke two rocks at the edge of the Tequendama Falls and all the water came out, forming a waterfall. Bochica punished Huitaca and Chibchacum: He made Huitaca an owl and made her hold up the sky. Chibchacum was tasked with holding up the Earth.
* Bachué: the mother of the Muisca people. It was said that a beautiful woman with a baby came out of Lake Iguaque. Bachué sat down at the bank of the lake and waited for the child to grow up. When he was old enough, they married and had many children, who were the Muisca. Bachué taught them to hunt, to farm, to respect the laws, and to worship the gods. Bachué was so good and loved that the Muisca referred to her as &quot;Furachoque&quot; (Good woman in Chibcha). When they became old, Bachué and her husband decided to go back to the deep of the lagoon. That day the Muisca were so sad, but at the same time very happy because they knew their mother was very happy. Other versions of the legend say that after stepping into the lagoon of Iguaque, Bachué ascended to the sky and became Chía; in other versions Chia and Bachué are two different figures.

==== Astronomy ====
The cult of the Muisca centered on two main deities; Sué for the Sun and Chía for the Moon. They developed a vigesimal (based on 20) calendar and knew exactly the timing of the summer solstice (June 21), which they considered the Day of &quot;Sué&quot;, the Sun god. The Sué temple was in Sogamoso, the sacred city of the Sun and the seat of the Iraca (priest). The Muisca name of the city, &quot;Suamox&quot; or &quot;Sugamuxi&quot;, means &quot;City of the Sun&quot;. On the solstice, the &quot;zaque&quot; went to Suamox for a major festival where ritual offerings were made. It was the only day of the year when the &quot;zaque&quot; showed his face, as he was considered a descendant of the Sun god.

=== Mythology ===

The Muisca mythology is well documented. Many of the writers who contributed to the &quot;Chronicles of the West Indies&quot; were based in Bogotá. They recorded many of the myths as they were interested in the traditions and culture of the conquered people. The Muisca territory became the seat of the colonial administration for the New Kingdom of Granada (Spanish: &quot;Nuevo Reino de Granada&quot;).

=== El Dorado ===

The origin of the legend of &quot;El Dorado&quot; (Spanish for &quot;The Golden One&quot;) in the early 16th century may be located in the Muisca Confederation. The &quot;zipa&quot; offered gold and other treasures to the Guatavita goddess. To do so, the &quot;zipa&quot; covered himself with gold dust and washed it off in the lake while tossing gold trinkets into the waters. This tradition was well known outside the Confederation, as far as the Caribbean Sea; the Spaniards were attracted by stories of a &quot;city of gold&quot; that did not exist. Indigenous people sometimes got rid of the avaricious Spaniards in that way, pointing them in the direction of other peoples. Lake Guatavita was explored by conquistadors who were looking for gold offerings from the &quot;zipa&quot; to the goddess. The legend grew until the term became a metaphor for any place where great wealth may be found or made.

=== Architecture ===

The Muisca did not construct large stone structures. They didn&#x27;t use the abundant rock to leave monumental ruins as has happened with other American cultures. Their houses were built with clay, canes, and wood. The houses had a conical form, most of them to the point that Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, founder of Bogotá, gave the area the name &quot;Valle de los Alcázares&quot; (&quot;Valley of the Palaces&quot;). The houses had small doors and windows, and the dwellings of the higher rank citizens were different. The Muisca used little furniture as they would typically sit on the floor.


== The Spanish conquest ==

Rivalries between the &quot;zaque&quot; and the &quot;zipa&quot; were taken advantage of by the Spaniards as they conquered the heart of what would be Colombia. Some of them, such as Sebastián de Belalcázar, Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, and Nicolás de Federman, interested in locating El Dorado, discovered the rich plains of Cundinamarca and Boyacá. The presence of the Spaniards gave hope to both sovereigns that, were they to make one Confederation, they could prevail in a war against the Spaniards. But the Spaniards prevailed.

The reaction of the chief leaders and the people did little to change the destiny of the Confederations. The Spanish executed the last Muisca sovereigns, Sagipa and Aquiminzaque, in 1539 and 1540 respectively. In 1542 Gonzalo Suárez Rendón finally put down the last resistance and the territories of the Confederations were shared by Belalcazar, Federmann, and De Quesada. Later the Spanish Crown would elect de Quesada as the man in charge, with the title &quot;adelantado de los cabildos de Santa Fe y Tunja&quot;.

=== Last Muisca sovereigns ===

=== Under the colonial regime ===

When the Muisca structure disappeared under the Spanish Conquest, the territory of the Confederations of the &quot;zaque&quot; and &quot;zipa&quot; were included in a new political division within the Spanish colonies in America. The territory of the Muisca, located in a fertile plain of the Colombian Andes that contributed to make one of the most advanced South American civilizations, became part of the colonial region named Nuevo Reino de Granada. Much information about the Muisca culture was gathered by the Spanish administration and by authors such as Pedro de Aguado and Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita. The viceregal era contributed to the importance of Bogotá, and people from the area would play an important role in the fights for independence and republican consolidation.

=== Independent Colombia ===
==== 20th century ====
After independence in 1810, the new state dissolved many of the Indigenous reservations. The one in Tocancipá was dissolved in 1940. The one in Sesquilé was reduced to 10% of its original size. Tenjo was reduced to 54% of its original size after 1934, and the Indigenous lands in Suba, a northern region in modern-day Bogotá, which had been recognized and protected by the crown, were taken away by the republican governments following a strategy of suppression of the native culture and ethnic presence in the country&#x27;s largest urban centres. The Reservation of Cota was re-established on land bought by the community in 1916, and then recognized by the 1991 constitution; the recognition was withdrawn in 1998 by the state and restored in 2006.

In 1948 the state forbade the production of chicha, a corn-based alcoholic drink. This was a blow to the culture and economy of the Muisca. The ban remained until 1991. Since then, the &quot;Festival of the chicha, maize, life, and joy&quot; is celebrated every year in Barrio La Perseverancia, a neighborhood in Bogotá where most of the chicha is produced.

==== 21st century ====

Since 1989, there has been a process of reconstruction of the Indigenous councils by the surviving members of the Muisca culture. Muisca Councils currently working are Suba, Bosa, Cota, Chía, and Sesquilé. The councils had an Assembly in Bosa on 20–22 September 2002, called the &quot;First General Congress of the Muisca People&quot;. In that congress, they founded the Cabildo Mayor del Pueblo Muisca, affiliated to the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC). They proposed linguistic and cultural recuperation, defense of the territories nowadays occupied by others, and proposed urban and tourist plans. They support the communities of Ubaté, Tocancipá, Soacha, Ráquira, and Tenjo in their efforts to recover their organizational and human rights.

The Muisca people of Suba opposed the drying up of the Tibabuyes wetland and wanted to recover the Juan Amarillo wetland. They defended the natural reserves like &quot;La Conejera&quot;, part of the Suba Hills that is considered by the Shelter&#x27;s Council to be communal land. &quot;Suati&quot; Magazine (&quot;The Song of the Sun&quot;) is a publication of poetry, literature, and essays about Muisca culture.

The community of Bosa made important achievements in its project of natural medicine in association with the Paul VI Hospital and the District Secretary of Health of Bogotá. The community of Cota has reintroduced the growing of quinua, and regularly barter their products at market.

Toward the end of 2006 there was a report on the Muisca population:

* Three Muisca councils: Cota, Chía, and Sesquilé, with a population of 2,318 persons
* in the Capital District 5,186 people are registered as belonging to the Muisca ethnic group
* in the localities of Suba and Bosa, 1,573 people are registered
* the report does not include the number of people of the Muisca ethnic group in the entire territory of the ancient Muisca Confederation or outside that territory. It does not include Muisca Creole persons, it is to say, those of mixed Muisca ancestry.

== Sources on the Muisca and scholarly research ==
Writings on the Muisca have a long tradition, dating from the conquest era with Spanish chronicles, colonial-era Spanish religious and civil administrative records, the findings of modern archeologists and anthropologists, and revised interpretations by scholars in recent years. Unlike the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica, the Muisca did not have a system of writing before the Spanish invasion in the sixteenth century and during the colonial era, so that the understanding of Muisca history and culture has largely been based non-native sources. Spanish cleric Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita authored a major work the New Kingdom of Granada, the &quot;Historia general de las conquistas de; Nuevo Reyno de Granada, a la S.C.R.M. de D. Carlos Segundo&quot;, 1688, which has shaped colonial era and, until recently, modern understandings of the Muisca. This work creates an image of the Precolombian Muisca, with powerful political structures and a unified religion and priestly hierarchy. Recent scholarship has re-examined early published writings and sought new sources in a variety of archives to posit a different understanding of the Muisca. The Muisca have been integral to the formation of national identity in Colombia, with Colombian scholar Carl Henrik Langebaek describing them as &quot;the official &#x27;tribe&#x27; of the Colombian nation&quot; and &quot;a local version of the Aztecs and Incas&quot;. The interpretation of the sixt,eenth-century Spanish invasion has received new attention which departs from a Eurocentric, triumphalist narrative. 

Since independence in the early nineteenth century, investigations into Muisca culture as part of national identity formation began. In 1849 president Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera invited Italian cartographer Agustín Codazzi, who led the Geography Commission with Manuel Ancízar and did descriptive studies of the national territory and an inventory of the archaeological sites. The result of the expedition was published in Bogotá in 1889 as &quot;Peregrinación Alfa&quot;. Argüello García pointed out that the goal of that expedition in the context of the new nation was to underline the pre-Hispanic societies and in that sense, they centered on the Muisca culture as the main model. A similar tendency can be found in the works of Ezequiel Uricoechea. An objection to that point of view came from Vicente Restrepo: his work &quot;Los chibchas antes de la conquista española&quot; showed them as barbarians.

Miguel Triana, in his work &quot;La Civilización Chibcha&quot; suggested that the rock art symbols were writing. Wenceslao Cabrera Ortíz was the one who concluded that the Muisca were migrants to the highlands; in 1969 he published on this and reported about excavations at the El Abra archaeological site. Those publications opened a new era in the studies of the pre-Hispanic cultures in Colombia.

Recent archaeological work has also concentrated on the creation and composition of Muisca goldwork, with this data being made available for wider research.

== Named after the Muisca and their culture ==

Several (fossil) flora and fauna found in Colombia in the area of the Muisca have been named after the people. Two volcanoes on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io have been named after the Muisca religion and mythology.

<text>Misrata ( ; , ; also spelled Misratah and known by the Italian spelling Misurata) is a city in northwestern Libya located in the Misrata District, situated to the east of Tripoli on the Mediterranean coast near Cape Misrata. With a population of about 881,000, it is the third-largest city in Libya, after Tripoli and Benghazi. It is the capital city of the Misrata District and has been called the economic and trade capital of Libya. Its harbor is at Qasr Ahmad.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Misrata ⵎⵙⵔⴰⵜⴰ&quot; derives from the Misrata tribe, a section of the larger Berber Hawwara confederacy, whose homeland in Antiquity and the early Islamic period was coastal Tripolitania.

&quot;Trirone Acrone&quot;, the oldest description mentioned by Ptolemy III Euergetes of Misrata because it consists of three heads of land stretching into the sea depth, and got Misrata importance by being at the crossroads of many convoys and also because it is in the middle of an agricultural area with the name of &quot;Cephalae Promentorium&quot; (Kevalay) of the Greek geographer Strabo. And the city of Misrata is one of the commercial stations that have been built by the Phoenicians, since more than 3000 years (The Tenth Century BC) to the north-western parts of the Libyan coast. The flag then by the name of Thubactis Misrata and know that name in relation to the Berber tribe of Misurata (The Misurateens), which means the sailors.

==History==
===Early history===
Modern Misrata was established around the 7th century AD during the beginning of modern Libya&#x27;s rule by the Caliphate. Some contemporary sources claim the town existed prior to Islamic rule, during the Roman Empire era and that its initial Arabic name derived from its Roman name Thubactis. David Mattingly, author of &quot;Tripolitania&quot;, a comprehensive reference book on northwestern Libya, stated that identification of Misrata as the ancient Thubactis is particularly problematic, complicated and &quot;defies an easy answer.&quot; Nonetheless, the Roman town was located at some point on the oasis upon which the modern city sits. The two common identifications are at the eastern and western anchorages of modern Misrata or south and inland of the city, respectively. The Roman town was recorded as one of the six &quot;municipia&quot; (small self-governing cities) of the Tripolitania province, a rank below &quot;coloniae&quot; (cities with full citizenship rights.)

In any case, in the 7th century, Misrata served as a caravan supply center and an important port. Merchant traders from Misrata were well known throughout the Sahara during the years of the Caliphate (7th–19th centuries). In addition to its strategic location, the city established itself as one of Libya&#x27;s oldest producers of luxury carpets. The Misrata tribe, a section of the larger Berber Hawwara confederacy, inhabited the coastal region of Tripolitania during the Roman and early Arab eras.

===Ottoman era===

The region of Tripolitania, which included Misrata, came under the regency of the Ottoman Empire in 1551. By the beginning of the 19th century, Misrata had established itself as a major center for the Trans-Saharan trade route, where caravans carrying gold, leather, and slaves regularly stopped. Because of the rainfall along the coast, which was abundant compared to other cities in Tripolitania, and supplemental water from underground springs, Misrata&#x27;s inhabitants were able to engage in unusually fertile agriculture in this largely arid region. The city was filled with thick areas of vegetable gardens while the surrounding countryside included fields of wheat, barley, date palms and olive orchards. Misrata&#x27;s artisans also expanded on the city&#x27;s ancient carpet industry for which it was regionally renowned. Although Misrata contained a well-built harbor, most of its long-distance trade was overland because the city of Benghazi to the east served as the preferable substitute for maritime shipping.

As a result of the abolition of slavery and increasing European colonial influence in Sub-Saharan Africa, Trans-Saharan trade declined and consequently Misrata&#x27;s role in the trade decreased. However, the decline in Trans-Saharan trade saw the establishment of weekly and permanent markets in the city, replacing the seasonal markets associated with long-distance trade. Because of this new economic situation, the residents of the countryside devoted less time to pastoralism, husbandry and guide service for foreign traders and began to shift their focus on agricultural production. Farmers concentrated on growing cash crops, relying on market relations to provide income for their families, instead of subsistence farming and periodic barter exchanging. Bedouins increasingly abandoned their nomadic lifestyle and began to settle into permanent dwellings within the city limits. To cope with an rising population due to immigration from the surrounding areas, Misrata witnessed a construction boom in the late 19th century. A covered produce market and numerous streets lined with shops were built in addition to new district and municipal government offices, a renovated Ottoman army barracks and several Turkish-style houses for the city&#x27;s wealthy families.

Two clans, the Muntasir and Adgham, dominated the political, social and economic aspects of Misrata and led the local tribes against their Turkish overlords during various periods of tension. There were many wealthy families in the city, but the Muntasirs, who were of Arabian descent, and the Adghams, who descended from Ottoman officers who settled in the province in previous centuries, were the most prominent. They made their income from commerce and protected their wealth by cooperating with the Ottoman provincial authorities. Both had extended families and economic holdings not just in Misrata, but also the provincial capital of Tripoli as well as the eastern Cyrenican towns of Benghazi and Derna. The Aghdams had traditionally resisted efforts by the central Ottoman government in Istanbul to reestablish direct control over Tripoli Province and, under the leadership of Osman al-Aghdam, they led a rebellion against the Ottomans and their local allies in 1835. After their eventual defeat in 1858, they were left in an inferior position to that of the Muntasirs. The Aghdams remained a powerful force nonetheless and their competition with the Muntasirs for leading positions within the local and regional government dominated Misratan politics. Misrata&#x27;s urban residents did not contribute much to the political scene and avoided contact with the Ottoman authorities out of concern of conscription into the army and provincial tax collection. In contrast, the rural areas of Misrata were populated mostly by &quot;fellahin&quot; (peasantry) and former Bedouins who had retained their tribal affiliations and loyalties and thus involved themselves in competition for political influence.

Up until 1908, the Muntasirs, led by Umar al-Muntasir, controlled the upper echelons of the newly organized bureaucracy in Tripoli Province and were largely accepted by the local notables as the administrators of Misrata along with Sirte, Gharyan and Tarhuna. However, that year, the Young Turks acquired power in Istanbul and ousted the traditional Ottoman leadership. Viewing the Muntasirs as loyalists of Abdul Hamid II, the ousted sultan, they made efforts to reduce Muntasir power in the region. The Young Turk administration in Tripoli vetoed Muntasir membership in the local parliament and dismissed the governor of Tarhuna who was Umar al-Muntasir&#x27;s son, Ahmad Dhiya al-Muntasir, from his post. In addition, they allegedly hired a group of local Misratans to assassinate Abd al-Qasim, another one Umar&#x27;s sons.

===Italian occupation===
In October 1911, Italy had launched an invasion against Ottoman Tripolitania, but were unable to reach Misrata until June 1912. Ahmad Dhiya al-Muntasir had consulted with the Italians in Rome months prior to the invasion and Umar al-Muntasir used his influence to coordinate with them militarily once they landed on the Libyan coastline. In return for their collaboration, the Muntasirs were able to maintain their administrative role and gained positions as advisers to the Italian military authorities.

During World War I, Misrata played an important role in the Libyan-Ottoman resistance against the occupying Italian Army. Under the leadership of Ramadan al-Swehli, the city was used a base of support for the Ottoman Empire and his Misratan army dealt a major blow to the Italians at Qasr Abu Hadi near Sirte in April 1915. Over 500 Italian troops were killed while Swehli&#x27;s troops captured over 5,000 rifles, various types of machine guns and artillery and several tons of ammunition. As a result of this Libyan victory, Italy&#x27;s army and their Muntasir allies withdrew from Misrata. By 1916, Misrata had become semi-autonomous and collected taxes from Sirte, the region of Fezzan and the area between it and Sirte as well as the Warfalla tribal area south of Tripoli. Because of its strategic harbor, Ottoman and German forces used Misrata as one of their principal supply ports during World War I. The city became the headquarters of a wide-ranging administration which supervised military recruitment and tax collection, had its own ammunition factory, printed its own currency and operated its own schools and hospitals. However, once Nuri Bey, the Ottoman officer in charge of the Libyan front, was recalled to Istanbul in early 1918, Ottoman influence waned in Misrata. Suwayhli lost his main backer and a huge source of funding as a result.

Although the Italians reestablished their control of much of Libya following their victory in World War I, al-Swehli retained his position as administrator of Misrata. In 1920 he expelled his Italian adviser from Misrata and controlled the town independently with about 10,000 fighters. &quot;Al Rakib&quot;, a Tripoli-based newspaper, commended the order and security in place at Misrata under al-Swehli as well as the strict application of Islamic law including the suppression of hard liquor. In June, however, al-Swehli attempted to attack the Muntasirs and Warfalla in the area between Misrata and Tripoli, but his forces were defeated and al-Swehli was executed by Abd al-Qadir al-Muntasir&#x27;s troops. A few weeks after the battle, the new Italian governor attacked Misrata.

During the mid-1920s and 1930s, Misrata became a center of Italian colonization. A new town was laid out on a grid pattern and several public buildings were constructed including a new municipal office, the first hospital of the area, a modern state-of-the-art church (which was later converted to a mosque) and a large hotel. Giuseppe Volpi was named Conte di Misrata, or the &quot;Count of Misrata.&quot; In 1935 the construction of the road connecting Zuwara in the west to Misrata was completed. Later in 1937 was built the Via Balbia, a main road that connected Misrata with Tripoli and Benghazi, and in 1938 Libya governor Italo Balbo created on the outskirts of Misrata the new cities of &quot;Gioda&quot; and &quot;Crispi&quot;.

In January 1939, the Kingdom of Italy created the 4th Shore, with Libya&#x27;s four coastal provinces of Tripoli, Misrata, Bengasi, and Derna becoming an integral part of metropolitan Italy. The last railway development in Libya done by the Italians was the &quot;Tripoli-Benghazi line&quot; that was started in 1941 and was never completed because of the Italian defeat during World War II: a new railway station was built in Misrata, but was destroyed by the British attacks in 1942.

===Independence===
In response to alleged vote rigging during the 1952 parliamentary elections, Misrata witnessed mass riots which contributed to the Libyan monarchy&#x27;s permanent ban on political parties.

Following Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s coup that overthrew the monarchy of King Idris in 1969, Misrata grew rapidly from the 1970s onward. Two iron and steel mills were established in the city resulting in a mass migration of Libyans from nearby rural areas to Misrata and consequently generated population and economic growth. The marina was rapidly developed to host shipping to service the steel plants and other factories with raw materials and other goods.

During this period Misrata became the principal economic, educational and administrative center of eastern Tripolitania. The majority of government ministries have branch offices in the city in addition to several college universities, schools and hospitals. The commercial area of Misrata contains numerous shops, restaurants, and cafes. The extensive development of the city attracted large numbers of immigrants to Misrata, giving it a cosmopolitan atmosphere. The main square adjacent to the old souk resembles those of major Moroccan cities.

===Revolution===
Starting on 20 February 2011, small demonstrations took place in Misrata in solidarity with anti-government protesters in Benghazi. Libyan police immediately arrested the Misratan protesters, sparking larger demonstrations which Libyan government forces sought to quell using live ammunition. Within a few days, 70 protesters were killed provoking outrage among the city&#x27;s inhabitants. By 24 February, Benghazi fell under the control of anti-Gaddafi forces in the Libyan uprising against Gaddafi. That same day, Gaddafi regime forces attempted to wrest control of the city, but were repelled.

The battle was renewed with shelling on 20 March as pro-Gaddafi tanks and artillery pushed forward and besieged Misrata. Eyewitnesses reported that pro-Gaddafi soldiers were shooting, killing and injuring unarmed civilians. The city was shelled by artillery, tanks, and snipers for over 40 days and had its water supply shut off by Gaddafi&#x27;s forces. By late April, over 1,000 people in the city were reported killed while around 3,000 were injured. With air support from NATO which entered the conflict on the rebels&#x27; side on March 19, and a vital sea-based life line from neighbouring country the Island of Malta, anti-Gaddafi forces managed to force loyalist troops to retreat on April 21, gaining control of most of the city by mid-May.

Thereafter, forces from Misrata played an important role in other theaters of the war, such as the Battle of Tripoli, the Battle of Sirte and the Battle of Bani Walid (2011).

==Geography==
Misrata lies on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea east of Tripoli and west of Benghazi. The location of the city creates a dualism of sea and sand, bounded by the sea to the north and east and to the south by golden sands dotted with palm and olive trees.

Like Benghazi and Tripoli, Misrata is divided into two distinct sections. Older Misrata consists of small stone houses and narrow arched streets while the newer part of the city, which began to develop in the 20th century, consists of modern buildings, homes, factories and industrial areas. Aside from its distinct location, which makes it a centre for the exchange of commodities and materials with the rest of the cities of the country, Misrata has modern infrastructure, including paved roads, electricity and communications.

===Climate===
The Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies Misrata&#x27;s climate as a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;).

The city is considered to be the &quot;main center of the Turkish-origin community in Libya&quot;; in total, the Turks form approximately two-thirds (est.270,000 in 2019) of Misrata&#x27;s 400,000 inhabitants.

==Economy==

Serving the role of Libya&#x27;s commercial hub, Misrata is notably clean and construction is well-organized. Its citizens are largely viewed by other Libyans as business oriented. The city&#x27;s steel mill industry (which is dominated by the government-owned Libyan Iron and Steel Company) is one its principal income producers and sources of employment. Due to the 1970s-80s renovation of Misrata&#x27;s marina to better supply the industrial plants with raw material, the industry has been able to expand and the steel mill authorities hold considerable influence in the city. Al-Naseem Dairy, one of the largest private companies in Libya, is also located in Misrata and employs around 750 workers.

A historic aspect of the local economy is the cloth and textile industry. Situated near the city&#x27;s central square are &quot;souks&quot; (&quot;open-air markets&quot;) where, usually three times a week, merchants continue to sell luxury carpets, furniture cloth and traditional clothing, including &quot;abayas&quot; (cloaks worn by males for celebratory occasions.)

Most major businesses, shops and social centers are located on Tripoli Street, Misrata&#x27;s main thoroughfare. During the Siege of Misrata, most of the buildings housing these assets were destroyed. However, several small businesses are beginning to rebuild and reopen. Nonetheless, recovery remains relatively slow partially due to the shortage of banknotes since Libyan banks are only allowing citizens to withdraw or borrow limited amounts of funds. Once the Libyan Central Bank receives most of the assets that had been internationally frozen during the civil war, it is probable that local banks would ease these restrictions.

The city has a great potential for expansion since it attracts a lot of internal immigration and is surrounded by uninhabited flat land with no obstacles. It is home to Misrata Airport, one of Libya&#x27;s largest airports. There is a port in the neighbouring town of Qasr Ahmad. Misrata is the seat of many national companies such as the Libyan Ports Company, Libyan Iron and Steel Company, the Libyan publishing, distribution and Advertising Company. Besides that, it has branches of public and private sector banks and one locally and privately owned bank.

==Government==
Misrata is governed by a local council consisting of 28 seats. The city held its first free elections on 20 February 2012 after a month of organizing. It was the first major city to hold local elections in post-Gaddafi Libya while other cities had their municipal officials by the national interim government. Voter registration was at 101,486 and the number of candidates was 28, all of whom were independents. The mayor of Misrata during the civil war was Khalifa al-Zwawy, while first elected mayor became Yousef Ben Yousef.

==Education==
Misurata University, with its 15 faculties, is located in the city of Misrata. There are several higher education institutions including a number of university faculties that are administratively linked to universities of other cities in Libya. Misurata University is a modern university which was established in 1983, persisting a long-term goal to have an educated community and to end illiteracy and innumeracy in society. Despite its short age, the university has gained excellence in providing the knowledge and skills required for higher education studies, and has enjoyed a great reputation for the teaching, research and training it provides. It has constantly topped the university rankings league in Libya and was recently ranked first in Libya and the 55th in Africa according to the Webometrics Rankings 2013. (e.g. Al-Tahadi University of Sirte and Tripoli University of Tripoli).

<text>Narni () is an ancient hilltown and (municipality) of Umbria, in central Italy, with 19,252 inhabitants (2017). At an altitude of , it overhangs a narrow gorge of the River Nera in the province of Terni. It is very close to the geographical centre of Italy. There is a stone on the exact spot with a sign in multiple languages.

== History ==
The area around Narni was already inhabited in the Paleolithic and Neolithic Ages, as attested by finds in some of the caves. Around the start of the first millennium the Osco-Umbrians, a people with a language of Indo-European origin that dominated the left bank of the Tiber that vertically cuts the region to the Adriatic Sea, settled in the area and called the town &quot;Nequinum&quot;. Records mention Nequinum as early as 600BC.

The Romans conquered Nequinum in the 4th century BC and made it a position of force at a key point of the Via Flaminia, the famous road which connected the city of Rome to the Adriatic Sea (at that time the road passed through the town descending to the right bank of the Nera to then carrying on to Carsulae, Acquasparta, Massa Martana and Spoleto). It supported the Gauls with the hope of freeing itself from Rome. The attempt failed and the victorious Romans changed its name to Narnia after the nearby Nar River; as in the case of Benevento, the former name was considered of ill augury— in means &#x27;I am unable&#x27;, and means &#x27;worthlessness&#x27;.

During Roman times the town was a strategic outpost for the Roman army. In 299BC it became a Roman Municipality and took the name &quot;Narnia&quot;. The rediscovery, in the late 20th – early 21st century, of an ancient Roman shipyard within its territory has made researchers hypothesise its particular importance during the Punic Wars. In 209BC, however, Narnia refused to help the Romans financially with their aim of continuing the war against Carthage.

The Roman Emperor Nerva was born at Narni in 30AD.

Narnia is mentioned in an Early Christian list of &quot;false gods&quot; in the second century Church father Tertullian&#x27;s &quot;Apologeticus&quot;, midway into Chapter 21: 

In Late Antiquity it suffered the events of the Greek-Gothic War (535–554) and was plundered by Totila. Narni was contested by the Exarchate of Ravenna and the Lombard Duchy of Spoleto in the late sixth century as the city controlled the southern reaches of the Via Flaminia, an essential route between Rome and Ravenna. Narni was the seat of a Lombard gastald. In 755 Fulrad went to . During the late 9th to early 10th century, Narni was, along with much of central Italy, a stronghold of—or threatened by—the Saracens. Narnia embraced the cause of Otho I of Saxony thanks to the mediation of its bishop, by then Pope John XVII.

From the 11th century it began to increase in wealth and power, was opposed to Pope Paschal II in 1112 and rose against Barbarossa in 1167. This insubordination cost Narni a ferocious repression imposed by the archbishop Christian of Mainz, Barbarossa&#x27;s chancellor. In 1242 Narni, prevalently tied to the Guelph party, entered into an alliance with Perugia and Rome against the Empire.

In the following century it was included in the reconquest of the papal patrimony by Cardinal Albornoz, who also had the mighty Rocca built. It was the work of Ugolino di Montemarte, known as &quot;il Gattapone&quot;. He was also author of the plans for the Loggia dei Priori and the Colonnade that faces out onto the Piazza dei Priori together with the 13th-century Palazzo del Podestà and the 14th-century fountain.

In 1373 Narni was given as fief to the Orsini to whom it returned in 1409. Occupied by King Ladislaus of Naples, in the 15th century, to be soon again reabsorbed by the church, thanks to Braccio da Montone. A decisive turning-point in Narni&#x27;s history was reached on 15July 1527 The troops of Charles V, mostly in fact German mercenaries (Landsknechts), put the city to fire and sword; it lost its ancient prosperity. Even the inhabitants of Terni took advantage of the situation to deliver their blame to give vent to their long-repressed hatred of Narni. Its reconstruction gives it a physiognomy characteristic of the cities in Papal territory. It became part of the Roman Republic in 1789. In 1831 it joined the revolt against Gregory XVI and was annexed to the Italian Kingdom in 1860.

== Monuments and sites of interest ==

Like many of the smaller towns of Umbria, Narni is still of strikingly medieval appearance today, with stone buildings, and narrow cobblestone streets. The town is famous for one of the largest Roman bridges (Ponte d&#x27;Augusto) ever built, by which the Via Flaminia crossed the Nera. One arch of the bridge still stands; it is some high.

There are a number of historical churches in the town:
* – decorated with 18th-century &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; frescoes
* ; a former Benedictine abbey located on Monte Santa Croce
* San Domenico – 12th-century church
* San Francesco – church located near the Palazzo dei Priori, built in late-Romanesque and Gothic styles

* Santa Maria Impensole – 12th-century Romanesque church in the town&#x27;s centre
* – Romanesque church just outside the town

* (or, Albornoz&#x27; Castle), overlooking the town, now hosting temporary exhibitions

== Narnia and C. S. Lewis ==
The imaginary land of Narnia, described in the works of C. S. Lewis, was named after Narni after he came across the name in an atlas as a child.

<text>Tarhunah Municipality () is one of the former municipalities (baladiyat) of Libya from 1983 to 1995. It is in the north of the country, in the position later (2001-2007) occupied by Tarhuna Wa Msalata District.

Tarhunah was brought to international attention in the 1990s, when it was believed that an underground chemical weapons facility was being built there, following the discovery of a previous smaller above-ground facility at Rabta (Algeria?).

<text>A decision support system (DSS) is an information system that supports business or organizational decision-making activities. DSSs serve the management, operations and planning levels of an organization (usually mid and higher management) and help people make decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified in advance—i.e., unstructured and semi-structured decision problems. Decision support systems can be either fully computerized or human-powered, or a combination of both.

While academics have perceived DSS as a tool to support decision making processes, DSS users see DSS as a tool to facilitate organizational processes. Some authors have extended the definition of DSS to include any system that might support decision making and some DSS include a decision-making software component; Sprague (1980) defines a properly termed DSS as follows:
# DSS tends to be aimed at the less well structured, underspecified problem that upper level managers typically face;
# DSS attempts to combine the use of models or analytic techniques with traditional data access and retrieval functions;
# DSS specifically focuses on features which make them easy to use by non-computer-proficient people in an interactive mode; and
# DSS emphasizes flexibility and adaptability to accommodate changes in the environment and the decision making approach of the user.

DSSs include knowledge-based systems. A properly designed DSS is an interactive software-based system intended to help decision makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions.

Typical information that a decision support application might gather and present includes:
*inventories of information assets (including legacy and relational data sources, cubes, data warehouses, and data marts),
*comparative sales figures between one period and the next,
*projected revenue figures based on product sales assumptions.

==History==
The concept of decision support has evolved mainly from the theoretical studies of organizational decision making done at the Carnegie Institute of Technology during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the implementation work done in the 1960s. DSS became an area of research of its own in the middle of the 1970s, before gaining in intensity during the 1980s.

In the middle and late 1980s, executive information systems (EIS), group decision support systems (GDSS), and organizational decision support systems (ODSS) evolved from the single user and model-oriented DSS. According to Sol (1987), the definition and scope of DSS have been migrating over the years: in the 1970s DSS was described as &quot;a computer-based system to aid decision making&quot;; in the late 1970s the DSS movement started focusing on &quot;interactive computer-based systems which help decision-makers utilize data bases and models to solve ill-structured problems&quot;; in the 1980s DSS should provide systems &quot;using suitable and available technology to improve effectiveness of managerial and professional activities&quot;, and towards the end of 1980s DSS faced a new challenge towards the design of intelligent workstations.

In 1987, Texas Instruments completed development of the Gate Assignment Display System (GADS) for United Airlines. This decision support system is credited with significantly reducing travel delays by aiding the management of ground operations at various airports, beginning with O&#x27;Hare International Airport in Chicago and Stapleton Airport in Denver, Colorado. Beginning in about 1990, data warehousing and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) began broadening the realm of DSS. As the turn of the millennium approached, new Web-based analytical applications were introduced.

DSS also have a weak connection to the user interface paradigm of hypertext. Both the University of Vermont PROMIS system (for medical decision making) and the Carnegie Mellon ZOG/KMS system (for military and business decision making) were decision support systems which also were major breakthroughs in user interface research. Furthermore, although hypertext researchers have generally been concerned with information overload, certain researchers, notably Douglas Engelbart, have been focused on decision makers in particular.

The advent of more and better reporting technologies has seen DSS start to emerge as a critical component of management design. Examples of this can be seen in the intense amount of discussion of DSS in the education environment.

==Applications==
DSS can theoretically be built in any knowledge domain. One example is the clinical decision support system for medical diagnosis. There are four stages in the evolution of clinical decision support system (CDSS): the primitive version is standalone and does not support integration; the second generation supports integration with other medical systems; the third is standard-based, and the fourth is service model-based.

DSS is extensively used in business and management. Executive dashboard and other business performance software allow faster decision making, identification of negative trends, and better allocation of business resources. Due to DSS, all the information from any organization is represented in the form of charts, graphs i.e. in a summarized way, which helps the management to take strategic decisions. For example, one of the DSS applications is the management and development of complex anti-terrorism systems. Other examples include a bank loan officer verifying the credit of a loan applicant or an engineering firm that has bids on several projects and wants to know if they can be competitive with their costs.

A growing area of DSS application, concepts, principles, and techniques is in agricultural production, marketing for sustainable development. Agricultural DSSes began to be developed and promoted in the 1990s. For example, the DSSAT4 package, The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer developed through financial support of USAID during the 1980s and 1990s, has allowed rapid assessment of several agricultural production systems around the world to facilitate decision-making at the farm and policy levels. Precision agriculture seeks to tailor decisions to particular portions of farm fields. There are, however, many constraints to the successful adoption of DSS in agriculture.

DSS is also prevalent in forest management where the long planning horizon and the spatial dimension of planning problems demand specific requirements. All aspects of Forest management, from log transportation, harvest scheduling to sustainability and ecosystem protection have been addressed by modern DSSs. In this context, the consideration of single or multiple management objectives related to the provision of goods and services that are traded or non-traded and often subject to resource constraints and decision problems. The Community of Practice of Forest Management Decision Support Systems provides a large repository on knowledge about the construction and use of forest Decision Support Systems.
A specific example concerns the Canadian National Railway system, which tests its equipment on a regular basis using a decision support system. A problem faced by any railroad is worn-out or defective rails, which can result in hundreds of derailments per year. Under a DSS, the Canadian National Railway system managed to decrease the incidence of derailments at the same time other companies were experiencing an increase.

DSS has been used for risk assessment to interpret monitoring data from large engineering structures such as dams, towers, cathedrals, or masonry buildings. For instance, Mistral is an expert system to monitor dam safety, developed in the 1990s by Ismes (Italy). It gets data from an automatic monitoring system and performs a diagnosis of the state of the dam. Its first copy, installed in 1992 on the Ridracoli Dam (Italy), is still operational 24/7/365. It has been installed on several dams in Italy and abroad (e.g., Itaipu Dam in Brazil), and on monuments under the name of Kaleidos. Mistral is a registered trade mark of CESI. GIS has been successfully used since the &#x27;90s in conjunction with DSS, to show on a map real-time risk evaluations based on monitoring data gathered in the area of the Val Pola disaster (Italy).

== Components ==

Three fundamental components of a DSS architecture are:
# the database (or knowledge base),
# the model (i.e., the decision context and user criteria)
# the user interface.

The users themselves are also important components of the architecture.

== Taxonomies ==
Using the relationship with the user as the criterion, Haettenschwiler differentiates &quot;passive&quot;, &quot;active&quot;, and &quot;cooperative DSS&quot;. A &quot;passive DSS&quot; is a system that aids the process of decision making, but that cannot bring out explicit decision suggestions or solutions. An &quot;active DSS&quot; can bring out such decision suggestions or solutions. A &quot;cooperative DSS&quot; allows for an iterative process between human and system towards the achievement of a consolidated solution: the decision maker (or its advisor) can modify, complete, or refine the decision suggestions provided by the system, before sending them back to the system for validation, and likewise the system again improves, completes, and refines the suggestions of the decision maker and sends them back to them for validation.

Another taxonomy for DSS, according to the mode of assistance, has been created by D. Power: he differentiates &quot;communication-driven DSS&quot;, &quot;data-driven DSS&quot;, &quot;document-driven DSS&quot;, &quot;knowledge-driven DSS&quot;, and &quot;model-driven DSS&quot;. 
*A &quot;communication-driven DSS&quot; enables cooperation, supporting more than one person working on a shared task; examples include integrated tools like Google Docs or Microsoft SharePoint Workspace.
*A &quot;data-driven DSS&quot; (or data-oriented DSS) emphasizes access to and manipulation of a time series of internal company data and, sometimes, external data.
*A &quot;document-driven DSS&quot; manages, retrieves, and manipulates unstructured information in a variety of electronic formats.
*A &quot;knowledge-driven DSS&quot; provides specialized problem-solving expertise stored as facts, rules, procedures or in similar structures like interactive decision trees and flowcharts.
*A &quot;model-driven DSS&quot; emphasizes access to and manipulation of a statistical, financial, optimization, or simulation model. Model-driven DSS use data and parameters provided by users to assist decision makers in analyzing a situation; they are not necessarily data-intensive. Dicodess is an example of an open-source model-driven DSS generator.

Using scope as the criterion, Power differentiates &quot;enterprise-wide DSS&quot; and &quot;desktop DSS&quot;. An &quot;enterprise-wide DSS&quot; is linked to large data warehouses and serves many managers in the company. A &quot;desktop, single-user DSS&quot; is a small system that runs on an individual manager&#x27;s PC.

== Development frameworks ==
Similarly to other systems, DSS systems require a structured approach. Such a framework includes people, technology, and the development approach.

The Early Framework of Decision Support System consists of four phases:
* &quot;Intelligence&quot; – Searching for conditions that call for decision;
* &quot;Design&quot; – Developing and analyzing possible alternative actions of solution;
* &quot;Choice&quot; – Selecting a course of action among those;
* &quot;Implementation&quot; – Adopting the selected course of action in decision situation.

DSS technology levels (of hardware and software) may include:
#The actual application that will be used by the user. This is the part of the application that allows the decision maker to make decisions in a particular problem area. The user can act upon that particular problem.
#Generator contains Hardware/software environment that allows people to easily develop specific DSS applications. This level makes use of case tools or systems such as Crystal, Analytica and iThink.
#Tools include lower level hardware/software. DSS generators including special languages, function libraries and linking modules

An iterative developmental approach allows for the DSS to be changed and redesigned at various intervals. Once the system is designed, it will need to be tested and revised where necessary for the desired outcome.

== Classification ==
There are several ways to classify DSS applications. Not every DSS fits neatly into one of the categories, but may be a mix of two or more architectures.

Holsapple and Whinston classify DSS into the following six frameworks: text-oriented DSS, database-oriented DSS, spreadsheet-oriented DSS, solver-oriented DSS, rule-oriented DSS, and compound DSS. A compound DSS is the most popular classification for a DSS; it is a hybrid system that includes two or more of the five basic structures.

The support given by DSS can be separated into three distinct, interrelated categories: Personal Support, Group Support, and Organizational Support.

DSS components may be classified as:
# &quot;Inputs&quot;: Factors, numbers, and characteristics to analyze
# &quot;User knowledge and expertise:&quot; Inputs requiring manual analysis by the user
# &quot;Outputs&quot;: Transformed data from which DSS &quot;decisions&quot; are generated
# &quot;Decisions&quot;: Results generated by the DSS based on user criteria

DSSs which perform selected cognitive decision-making functions and are based on artificial intelligence or intelligent agents technologies are called intelligent decision support systems (IDSS)

The nascent field of decision engineering treats the decision itself as an engineered object, and applies engineering principles such as design and quality assurance to an explicit representation of the elements that make up a decision.

<doc id="469583" wikidata="Q1152440" url="?curid=469583" title="Pickett's Charge">
<text>Pickett&#x27;s Charge was an infantry assault on 3 July 1863, during the Battle of Gettysburg. It was ordered by Confederate General Robert E. Lee as part of his plan to break through Union lines and achieve a decisive victory in the North. The charge was named after Major General George Pickett, one of the Confederate Army&#x27;s division commanders. The assault was aimed at the center of the Union Army&#x27;s position on Cemetery Ridge, which was believed to be a vulnerable point in the Union defenses. As the Confederate troops marched across nearly a mile of open ground, they came under heavy artillery and rifle fire from entrenched Union forces. The open terrain offered little cover, making the Confederate soldiers easy targets, and their ranks were quickly decimated. Although a small number of the Confederate soldiers managed to reach the Union lines and engage in hand-to-hand combat, they were ultimately overwhelmed. The charge ended in a disastrous defeat for the Confederates, with more than half of the men involved either killed, wounded, or captured. Pickett&#x27;s Charge marked the climax of the Battle of Gettysburg. The failure of the charge crushed the Confederate Army&#x27;s hopes of winning a decisive victory in the North and forced General Lee to retreat back to Virginia.

==Plans and command structures==
Pickett&#x27;s Charge was planned for three Confederate divisions, commanded by Maj. Gen. George Pickett, Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew, and Maj. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble, consisting of troops from Lt. Gen. James Longstreet&#x27;s First Corps and Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill&#x27;s Third Corps. Pettigrew commanded brigades from Maj. Gen. Henry Heth&#x27;s old division, under Col. Birkett D. Fry (Archer&#x27;s Brigade), Col. James K. Marshall (Pettigrew&#x27;s Brigade), Brig. Gen. Joseph R. Davis, and Col. John M. Brockenbrough. Trimble, commanding Maj. Gen. Dorsey Pender&#x27;s division, had the brigades of Brig. Gens. Alfred M. Scales (temporarily commanded by Col. William Lee J. Lowrance) and James H. Lane. Two brigades from Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson&#x27;s division (Hill&#x27;s Corps) were to support the attack on the right flank: Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox and Col. David Lang (Perry&#x27;s brigade).

The target of the Confederate assault was the center of the Union Army of the Potomac&#x27;s II Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock. Directly in the center was the division of Brig. Gen. John Gibbon with the brigades of Brig. Gen. William Harrow, Col. Norman J. Hall, and Brig. Gen. Alexander S. Webb. On the night of July 2, Meade correctly predicted to Gibbon at a council of war that Lee would try an attack on Gibbon&#x27;s sector the following morning. To the north of this position were brigades from the division of Brig. Gen. Alexander Hays, and to the south was Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday&#x27;s division of the I Corps, including the 2nd Vermont Brigade of Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard and the 121st Pennsylvania under the command of Col. Chapman Biddle. Meade&#x27;s headquarters were just behind the II Corps line, in the small house owned by the widow Lydia Leister.

The specific objective of the assault has been the source of historical controversy. Traditionally, the &quot;copse of trees&quot; on Cemetery Ridge has been cited as the visual landmark for the attacking force. Historical treatments such as the 1993 film &quot;Gettysburg&quot; continue to popularize this view, which originated in the work of Gettysburg Battlefield historian John B. Bachelder in the 1880s. However, recent scholarship, including published works by some Gettysburg National Military Park historians, has suggested that Lee&#x27;s goal was actually Ziegler&#x27;s Grove on Cemetery Hill, a more prominent and highly visible grouping of trees about 300 yards (274 m) north of the copse.

The much-debated theory suggests that Lee&#x27;s general plan for the second-day attacks (the seizure of Cemetery Hill) had not changed on the third day, and the attacks on July 3 were also aimed at securing the hill and the network of roads it commanded. The copse of trees, currently a prominent landmark, was under ten feet (3 m) high in 1863, visible to a portion of the attacking columns only from certain parts of the battlefield.

From the beginning of the planning, things went awry for the Confederates. While Pickett&#x27;s division had not been used yet at Gettysburg, A. P. Hill&#x27;s health became an issue and he did not participate in selecting which of his troops were to be used for the charge. Some of Hill&#x27;s corps had fought lightly on July 1 and not at all on July 2. However, troops that &quot;had&quot; done heavy fighting on July 1 ended up making the charge.

Although the assault is known to popular history as &quot;Pickett&#x27;s Charge&quot;, overall command was given to James Longstreet, and Pickett was one of his divisional commanders. Lee did tell Longstreet that Pickett&#x27;s fresh division should lead the assault, so the name is appropriate, although some recent historians have used the name &quot;Pickett–Pettigrew–Trimble Assault&quot; (or, less frequently, &quot;Longstreet&#x27;s Assault&quot;) to more fairly distribute the credit (or blame). With Hill sidelined, Pettigrew&#x27;s and Trimble&#x27;s divisions were delegated to Longstreet&#x27;s authority as well. Thus, Pickett&#x27;s name has been lent to a charge in which he commanded 3 out of the 11 brigades while under the supervision of his corps commander throughout.

Pickett&#x27;s men were almost exclusively from Virginia, with the other divisions consisting of troops from North Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Virginia, and Tennessee. The supporting troops under Wilcox and Lang were from Alabama and Florida.

In conjunction with the infantry assault, Lee planned a cavalry action in the Union rear. Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart led his cavalry division to the east, prepared to exploit Lee&#x27;s hoped-for breakthrough by attacking the Union rear and disrupting its line of communications (and retreat) along the Baltimore Pike.

Despite Lee&#x27;s hope for an early start, it took all morning to arrange the infantry assault force. Neither Lee&#x27;s nor Longstreet&#x27;s headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee&#x27;s oral order or a mistake. Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet&#x27;s Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee&#x27;s plan for the battle.

Meanwhile, on the far right end of the Union line, a seven-hour battle raged for the control of Culp&#x27;s Hill. Lee&#x27;s intent was to synchronize his offensive across the battlefield, keeping Meade from concentrating his numerically superior force, but the assaults were poorly coordinated and Maj. Gen. Edward &quot;Allegheny&quot; Johnson&#x27;s attacks against Culp&#x27;s Hill petered out just as Longstreet&#x27;s cannonade began. Meade knew another attack was imminent and sent a note to all his subordinates to scrape all stragglers and idle units and put them on the line.

==Artillery barrage==
The infantry charge was preceded by what Lee hoped would be a powerful and well-concentrated cannonade of the Union center, destroying the Union artillery batteries that could defeat the assault and demoralizing the Union infantry. But a combination of inept artillery leadership and defective equipment doomed the barrage from the beginning. Longstreet&#x27;s corps artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander, had effective command of the field; Lee&#x27;s artillery chief, Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, played little role other than to obstruct the effective placement of artillery from the other two corps. Despite Alexander&#x27;s efforts, then, there was insufficient concentration of Confederate fire on the objective.

The July 3 bombardment was likely the largest of the war, with hundreds of cannons from both sides firing along the lines for one to two hours, starting around 1 p.m. Confederate guns numbered between 150 and 170 and fired from a line over two miles (3 km) long, starting in the south at the Peach Orchard and running roughly parallel to the Emmitsburg Road. Confederate Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law wrote, &quot;The cannonade in the center ... presented one of the most magnificent battle-scenes witnessed during the war. Looking up the valley towards Gettysburg, the hills on either side were capped with crowns of flame and smoke, as 300 guns, about equally divided between the two ridges, vomited their iron hail upon each other.&quot;

Despite its ferocity, the fire was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often overshot the infantry front lines—in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation—and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly to create the illusion that they were being destroyed one by one. By the time all of Hunt&#x27;s cannons ceased fire, and still blinded by the smoke from battle, Alexander fell for Hunt&#x27;s deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander&#x27;s bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery—the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, and he had to evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill. The counter-battery fire depleted the northern ammunition stocks, leaving them insufficient time to replenish before the southern assault. For the rest of his life, Hunt always maintained that had he been allowed to do what he&#x27;d intended—saved his long range shells for the attack he knew was coming, then bombarded the Confederate forces with every gun available once they lined up for their advance—the charge would never have happened and many northern lives would have been saved.
The day was hot, 87 °F (31 °C) by one account, and humid, and the Confederates suffered under the hot sun and from the Union counter-battery fire as they awaited the order to advance. When Union cannoneers overshot their targets, they often hit the massed infantry waiting in the woods of Seminary Ridge or in the shallow depressions just behind Alexander&#x27;s guns, causing significant casualties before the charge began.

Longstreet had opposed the charge from the beginning, convinced the charge would fail (which ultimately proved true), and had his own plan that he would have preferred for a strategic movement around the Union left flank. In his memoirs, he recalled telling Lee:

Longstreet wanted to avoid personally ordering the charge by attempting to pass the mantle onto young Colonel Alexander, telling him that he should inform Pickett at the optimum time to begin the advance, based on his assessment that the Union artillery had been effectively silenced. Although he hadn&#x27;t become aware of such a development, Alexander eventually notified Pickett that he was running dangerously short of ammunition, sending the message &quot;If you are coming at all, come at once, or I cannot give you proper support, but the enemy&#x27;s fire has not slackened at all. At least eighteen guns are still firing from the cemetery itself.&quot; Pickett asked Longstreet, &quot;General, shall I advance?&quot; Longstreet recalled in his memoirs, &quot;The effort to speak the order failed, and I could only indicate it by an affirmative bow.&quot;

Longstreet made one final attempt to call off the assault. After his encounter with Pickett, he discussed the artillery situation with Alexander, and was informed that Alexander did not have full confidence that all the enemy&#x27;s guns were silenced, and that the Confederate ammunition was almost exhausted. Longstreet ordered Alexander to stop Pickett, but the young colonel explained that replenishing his ammunition from the trains in the rear would take over an hour, and this delay would nullify any advantage the previous barrage had given them. The infantry assault went forward without the Confederate artillery close support that had been originally planned.

==Infantry assault==
The entire force that stepped off toward the Union positions at about 2:00 p.m. comprised about 12,500 men. Although the attack is popularly called a &quot;charge&quot;, the men marched deliberately in line, prepared to speed up and charge only when they were within a few hundred yards of the enemy. The line consisted of Pettigrew and Trimble on the left, and Pickett to the right. The nine brigades of men stretched over a mile-long (1,600 m) front. The Confederates immediately encountered heavy artillery fire and were slowed by fences in their path. Fire from Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery&#x27;s concealed artillery positions north of Little Round Top raked the Confederate right flank, artillery fire from Cemetery Hill hit the left, while the center faced the cannons of the II Corps with the Union artillery reserve in a second line behind. The ground between Seminary Ridge and Cemetery Ridge is slightly undulating, and the advancing troops periodically disappeared from the view of the Union cannoneers while advancing the nearly three quarters of a mile across open fields to reach the Union line.

As the three Confederate divisions advanced, awaiting Union soldiers began shouting &quot;Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg!&quot; in reference to the disastrous Union advance on the Confederate line during the 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg. Shell and solid shot in the beginning turned to canister and musket fire as the Confederates came within 400 yards of the Union line. At this point Confederate unit cohesion and morale began to break down. The last shelter before reaching the Union lines lay at 300 yards, in the sunken depression of the Emmitsburg Road. Thousands of Confederates took to the ground there and refused to advance any further, many surrendering to Union troops after the battle. Over two-thirds of the initial force may have failed to make the final charge; at contact the mile-long front had shrunk to less than half a mile, as the men filled in gaps that appeared throughout the line and followed the natural tendency to move away from the flanking fire.

On the left flank of the attack, Brockenbrough&#x27;s brigade was devastated by artillery fire from Cemetery Hill. They were also subjected to a surprise musket fusillade from the 8th Ohio Infantry regiment. The 160 Ohioans, firing from a single line, so surprised Brockenbrough&#x27;s Virginians—already demoralized by their losses to artillery fire—that they panicked and fled back to Seminary Ridge, crashing through Trimble&#x27;s division and causing many of his men to bolt as well. The Ohioans followed up with a successful flanking attack on Davis&#x27;s brigade of Mississippians and North Carolinians, which was now the left flank of Pettigrew&#x27;s division. The survivors were subjected to increasing artillery fire from Cemetery Hill. More than 1,600 rounds were fired at Pettigrew&#x27;s men during the assault. This portion of the assault never advanced much farther than the sturdy fence at the Emmitsburg Road. By this time, the Confederates were close enough to be fired on by artillery canister and Alexander Hays&#x27; division unleashed very effective musketry fire from behind 260 yards of stone wall, with every rifleman of the division lined up as many as four deep, exchanging places in line as they fired and then fell back to reload.

Trimble&#x27;s division of two brigades followed Pettigrew&#x27;s, but made poor progress. Confusing orders from Trimble caused Lane to send only three and a half of his North Carolina regiments forward. Renewed fire from the 8th Ohio and the onslaught of Hays&#x27; riflemen prevented most of these men from getting past the Emmitsburg Road. Scales&#x27;s North Carolina brigade, led by Col. William L. J. Lowrance, started with a heavier disadvantage—they had lost almost two-thirds of their men on July 1. They were also driven back and Lowrance was wounded. The Union defenders also took casualties, but Hays encouraged his men by riding back and forth just behind the battle line, shouting &quot;Hurrah! Boys, we&#x27;re giving them hell!&quot;. Two horses were shot out from under him. Historian Stephen W. Sears calls Hays&#x27; performance &quot;inspiring&quot;.

On the right flank, Pickett&#x27;s Virginians crossed the Emmitsburg Road and wheeled partially to their left to face northeast. They marched in two lines, led by the brigades of Brig. Gen. James L. Kemper on the right and Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett on the left; Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Armistead&#x27;s brigade followed closely behind. As the division wheeled to the left, its right flank was exposed to McGilvery&#x27;s guns and the front of Doubleday&#x27;s Union division on Cemetery Ridge. Stannard&#x27;s Vermont Brigade marched forward, faced north, and delivered withering fire into the rear of Kemper&#x27;s brigade. At about this time, Hancock, who had been prominent in displaying himself on horseback to his men during the Confederate artillery bombardment, was wounded by a bullet striking the pommel of his saddle, entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail. He refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was settled.

As Pickett&#x27;s men advanced, they withstood the defensive fire of first Stannard&#x27;s brigade, then Harrow&#x27;s, and then Hall&#x27;s, before approaching a minor salient in the Union center, a low stone wall taking an 80-yard right-angle turn known afterward as &quot;The Angle&quot;. It was defended by Brig. Gen. Alexander S. Webb&#x27;s Philadelphia Brigade. Webb placed the two remaining guns of (the severely wounded) Lt. Alonzo Cushing&#x27;s Battery A, 4th U.S. Artillery, at the front of his line at the stone fence, with the 69th and 71st Pennsylvania regiments of his brigade to defend the fence and the guns. The two guns and 940 men could not match the massive firepower that Hays&#x27; division, to their right, had been able to unleash.

Two gaps opened up in the Union line: the commander of the 71st Pennsylvania ordered his men to retreat when the Confederates came too close to the Angle; south of the copse of trees, the men of the 59th New York (Hall&#x27;s brigade) inexplicably bolted for the rear. In the latter case, this left Captain Andrew Cowan and his 1st New York Independent Artillery Battery to face the oncoming infantry. Assisted personally by artillery chief Henry Hunt, Cowan ordered five guns to fire double canister simultaneously. The entire Confederate line to his front disappeared. The gap vacated by most of the 71st Pennsylvania, however, was more serious, leaving only a handful of the 71st, 268 men of the 69th Pennsylvania, and Cushing&#x27;s two 3-inch rifled guns to receive the 2,500 to 3,000 men of Garnett&#x27;s and Armistead&#x27;s brigades as they began to cross the stone fence. The Irishmen of the 69th Pennsylvania resisted fiercely in a melee of rifle fire, bayonets, and fists. Webb, mortified that the 71st had retreated, brought the 72nd Pennsylvania (a Zouave regiment) forward. Initially, the regiment was hesitant to attack, this being due to the regiment not recognizing Webb as brigadier general (he had recently been promoted.) However, the 72nd moved forward after realizing their error, helping to plug the gap in the line. During the fight, Lt. Cushing was killed as he shouted to his men, three bullets striking him, the third in his mouth. The Confederates seized his two guns and turned them to face the Union troops (to no avail, as the armaments lacked ammunition). At this point, Union soldiers arrived and successfully charged into the breach.

The advancing Northerners overwhelmed the Confederate forces; the rebel advance then collapsed in turn. Given that Union forces had killed each senior Confederate officer commanding the forward-most units, no man had the authority to command the Southern forces to fall back in an orderly manner. This resulted in a disorganized retreat. As they left the battlefield, several Union officers on horseback picked up fallen Confederate battle flags and rode back and forth across the lines, dragging the flags behind them on the ground to taunt the retreating southerners.

The infantry assault lasted less than an hour. The supporting attack by Wilcox and Lang on Pickett&#x27;s right was never a factor; they did not approach the Union line until after Pickett was defeated, and their advance was quickly broken up by McGilvery&#x27;s guns and by the Vermont Brigade.

==Aftermath==
While the Union lost about 1,500 killed and wounded, the Confederate casualty rate was over 50%. Pickett&#x27;s division suffered 2,655 casualties (498 killed, 643 wounded, 833 wounded and captured, and 681 captured, unwounded). Pettigrew&#x27;s losses are estimated to be about 2,700 (470 killed, 1,893 wounded, 337 captured). Trimble&#x27;s two brigades lost 885 (155 killed, 650 wounded, and 80 captured). Wilcox&#x27;s brigade reported losses of 200, Lang&#x27;s about 400. Thus, total losses during the attack were 6,555, of which at least 1,123 Confederates were killed on the battlefield, 4,019 were wounded, and a good number of the injured were also captured. Confederate prisoner totals are difficult to estimate from their reports; Union reports indicated that 3,750 men were captured.

The casualties were also high among the commanders of the charge. Trimble and Pettigrew were the most senior casualties of the day; Trimble lost a leg, and Pettigrew received a minor wound to the hand (only to die from a bullet to the abdomen suffered in a minor skirmish during the retreat to Virginia). In Pickett&#x27;s division, 26 of the 40 field grade officers (majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels) were casualties—twelve killed or mortally wounded, nine wounded, four wounded and captured, and one captured. All of his brigade commanders fell: Kemper was wounded seriously, captured by Union soldiers, rescued, and then captured again during the retreat to Virginia; Garnett and Armistead were killed. Garnett had a previous leg injury and rode his horse during the charge, despite knowing that conspicuously riding a horse into heavy enemy fire would mean almost certain death.

Armistead, known for leading his brigade with his cap on the tip of his sword, made the farthest progress through the Union lines. He was mortally wounded, falling near &quot;The Angle&quot; at what is now called the high-water mark of the Confederacy and died two days later in a Union hospital. Ironically, the Union troops that fatally wounded Armistead were under the command of his old friend, Winfield Scott Hancock, who was himself severely wounded in the battle. Per his dying wishes, Longstreet delivered Armistead&#x27;s Bible and other personal effects to Hancock&#x27;s wife, Almira. Of the 15 regimental commanders in Pickett&#x27;s division, the Virginia Military Institute produced 11 and all were casualties—six killed, five wounded.

Stuart&#x27;s cavalry action in indirect support of the infantry assault was unsuccessful. He was met and stopped by Union cavalry under the command of Brig. Gen. David McMurtrie Gregg about three miles (5 km) to the east, in East Cavalry Field.

As soldiers straggled back to the Confederate lines along Seminary Ridge, Lee feared a Union counteroffensive and tried to rally his center, telling returning soldiers and Wilcox that the failure was &quot;all my fault&quot;. Pickett was inconsolable for the rest of the day and never forgave Lee for ordering the charge. When Lee told Pickett to rally his division for the defense, Pickett allegedly replied, &quot;General, I have no division.&quot;

The Union counteroffensive never came; the Army of the Potomac was exhausted and nearly as damaged at the end of the three days as the Army of Northern Virginia. Meade was content to hold the field. On July 4, the armies observed an informal truce and collected their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant accepted the surrender of the Vicksburg garrison along the Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy in two. These two Union victories are generally considered the turning point of the American Civil War.

History may never know the true story of Lee&#x27;s intentions at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett&#x27;s report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him to destroy it, and no copy has been found. Years later, when asked why the charge at Gettysburg failed, Pickett reportedly said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always thought the Yankees had something to do with it.&quot;

Virginian newspapers praised Pickett&#x27;s Virginia division as making the most progress during the charge, and the papers used Pickett&#x27;s comparative success as a means of criticizing the actions of the other states&#x27; troops during the charge. It was this publicity that played a significant factor in selecting the name Pickett&#x27;s Charge. Pickett&#x27;s military career was never the same after the charge, and he was displeased about having his name attached to the repulsed charge. In particular North Carolinians have long taken exception to the characterizations and point to the poor performance of Brockenbrough&#x27;s Virginians in the advance as a major causative factor of failure. Some historians have questioned the primacy of Pickett&#x27;s role in the battle. W. R. Bond wrote in 1888, &quot;No body of troops during the last war made as much reputation on so little fighting.&quot;

Additional controversy developed after the battle about Pickett&#x27;s personal location during the charge. The fact that fifteen of his officers and all three of his brigadier generals were casualties while Pickett managed to escape unharmed led many to question his proximity to the fighting and, by implication, his personal courage. The 1993 film &quot;Gettysburg&quot; depicts him observing on horseback from the Codori Farm at the Emmitsburg Road, but there is no historical evidence to confirm this. It was established doctrine in the Civil War that commanders of divisions and above would &quot;lead from the rear&quot;, while brigade and more junior officers were expected to lead from the front, and while this was often violated, there was nothing for Pickett to be ashamed of if he coordinated his forces from behind.

==The Lost Cause==
Pickett&#x27;s Charge has become one of the central symbols of the literary and cultural movement known as the Lost Cause, in particular for Virginians. Proponents extol the bravery of Confederate soldiers attacking headlong into Union lines, the capable leadership of southern generals inspiring overwhelming confidence in their men, especially that of Virginians such as Lee and Pickett, and the tantalizing closeness of ultimate victory. William Faulkner, the quintessential Southern novelist, summed up the picture in Southern myth of this gallant but futile episode:

Over time this view came to dominate perceptions of the battle, despite the initial protestations from groups both north and south. Northern veterans in particular opposed the decreasing emphasis on their hard-fought defense of Cemetery Ridge in favor of extolling the bravery and sacrifice of the attacking Confederate army. Non-Virginian southerners took offense at the overwhelming focus the myth places on Virginian leaders and Virginian troops, despite that larger number of Northern Carolina troops, who sustained greater casualties than the Virginian regiments. Nevertheless, after decades of strident historicizing this narrative had firmly taken root and by the battle&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1913 it had become in many ways the standard interpretation of what occurred.

Modern analysis, however, has increasingly shifted away from many of the Lost Cause interpretation&#x27;s tenets. Lee&#x27;s decision to conduct the attack has been characterized as the culmination of multiple strategic and tactical blunders, and the sacrifice of his troops as unnecessary. Examination of casualty records, capture reports, and first hand accounts has revealed that substantial numbers of Confederate troops involved in the attack refused to make the final charge, instead choosing to shelter in the sunken depression of the Emmitsburg Road and surrender to Union soldiers after the battle. And later research has shown that it is unlikely Pickett&#x27;s charge could ever have provided the decisive victory imagined by Lee; a study using the Lanchester model to examine several alternative scenarios suggested that Lee could have captured a foothold on Cemetery Ridge if he had committed several more infantry brigades to the charge; but this likely would have left him with insufficient reserves to hold or exploit the position afterwards.

==The battlefield today==

The site of Pickett&#x27;s Charge is one of the best-maintained portions of the Gettysburg Battlefield. Despite millions of annual visitors to Gettysburg National Military Park, very few have walked in the footsteps of Pickett&#x27;s division. The National Park Service maintains a neat, mowed path alongside a fence that leads from the Virginia Monument on West Confederate Avenue (Seminary Ridge) due east to the Emmitsburg Road in the direction of the Copse of Trees.

Pickett&#x27;s division, however, started considerably south of that point, near the Spangler farm, and wheeled to the north after crossing the road. In fact, the Park Service pathway stands &quot;between&quot; the two main thrusts of Longstreet&#x27;s assault—Trimble&#x27;s division advanced north of the current path, while Pickett&#x27;s division moved from farther south.

A cyclorama painting by the French artist Paul Philippoteaux entitled &quot;The Battle of Gettysburg&quot;, also known as the Gettysburg Cyclorama, depicts Pickett&#x27;s Charge from the vantage point of the Union defenders on Cemetery Ridge. Completed and first exhibited in 1883, it is one of the last surviving cycloramas in the United States. It was restored and relocated to the new National Park Service Visitor Center in September 2008.

<text>Dame Janet Abbott Baker (born 21 August 1933) is an English mezzo-soprano best known as an opera, concert, and lieder singer.

Baker is particularly closely associated with baroque and early Italian opera and the works of Benjamin Britten. During her career, which lasted from the 1950s to the 1980s, she was considered an outstanding singing actress and widely admired for her dramatic intensity, perhaps best represented in her famous portrayal as Dido, the tragic heroine of Berlioz&#x27;s magnum opus, &quot;Les Troyens&quot;. As a concert performer, Baker was noted for her interpretations of the music of Gustav Mahler and Edward Elgar. David Gutman, writing in &quot;Gramophone&quot;, described her performance of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot; as &quot;intimate, almost self-communing&quot;.

==Biography and career==

===Early life===
Janet Abbott Baker was born in Hatfield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, where her father was an engineer as well as a chorister. Members of her family worked at Bentley Pit, in Doncaster. She attended York College for Girls and then Wintringham Girls&#x27; Grammar School in Grimsby. The death, when she was 10 years old, of her elder brother Peter, from a heart condition, was a formative moment that made her take responsibility for the rest of her life; she revealed this in a BBC Radio 3 Lebrecht Interview in September 2011.

In her early years Baker worked in a bank, transferring to London in 1953 where she trained with Meriel St Clair and Helene Isepp, whose son Martin became her regular accompanist. Knocked down by a bus in 1956, she suffered concussion and a persistently painful back injury. In the same year she came second in the Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Competition at the Wigmore Hall, winning national attention.

===Debut===
In 1956, she made her stage debut with Oxford University&#x27;s Opera Club as Miss Róza in Smetana&#x27;s &quot;The Secret&quot;. That year, she also made her debut at Glyndebourne. In 1959, she sang Eduige in the Handel Opera Society&#x27;s &quot;Rodelinda&quot;; other Handel roles included &quot;Ariodante&quot; (1964), of which she later made a notable recording with Raymond Leppard, and &quot;Orlando&quot; (1966), which she sang at the Barber Institute, Birmingham.

===Opera===
With the English Opera Group at Aldeburgh, Baker sang Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; in 1962, Polly (in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s version of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;) and Lucretia (in Britten&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot;). At Glyndebourne she appeared again as Dido (1966) and as Diana/Jupiter in Francesco Cavalli&#x27;s &quot;La Calisto&quot;, and Penelope in Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in Patria&quot;. For Scottish Opera she sang Dorabella in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; and Dido in Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;The Trojans&quot;, as well as Dido in Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, Octavian in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, the Composer in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; and the role of Orfeo in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;. The latter was considered her signature role; she sang it in many productions, and a videotaped performance from Glyndebourne is available (see below).

In 1966, Baker made her debut as Hermia in Britten&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and went on to sing there Berlioz&#x27;s Dido; Kate in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot;; Mozart&#x27;s Vitellia (in &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;) and Idamante (in &quot;Idomeneo&quot;); Cressida in William Walton&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;; and the title role in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Alceste&quot; (1981). For the English National Opera, she sang the title role in Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; (1971), Charlotte in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot;, and the title roles in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; and Handel&#x27;s &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;.

===Oratorio and song===
During this same period she made an equally strong impact on audiences in the concert hall, both in oratorio roles and solo recitals. Among her most notable achievements are her recordings of the Angel in Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, made with Sir John Barbirolli in December 1964 and Sir Simon Rattle over twenty years later; her 1965 performances of Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Sea Pictures&quot; and Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Rückert Lieder&quot;, also recorded with Barbirolli; and, also from 1965, the first commercial recording of Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s Christmas oratorio &quot;Hodie&quot; under Sir David Willcocks with The Bach Choir. In 1963, she sang the contralto part in the first performance at the BBC Promenade Concerts of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection&quot; Symphony under the direction of Leopold Stokowski, then making his Proms debut appearances. She performed in 1971 for the Peabody Mason Concert series in Boston.

In 1976 she premiered the solo cantata &quot;Phaedra&quot;, written for her by Britten; and Dominick Argento&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning song cycle &quot;From the Diary of Virginia Woolf&quot;, also written with her voice in mind. She has also been highly praised for her insightful performances of Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Alto Rhapsody&quot; and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Wesendonck Lieder&quot;, as well as solo songs from the French, German and English repertoire.

===Retirement===
Dame Janet&#x27;s final operatic appearance was as Orfeo in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, on 17 July 1982, at Glyndebourne. In May 1988, she repeated the role in a concert performance with the Oratorio Society of New York (an unannounced farewell to the U.S.). She had continued to perform lieder recitals, retiring for good in 1989 (although she did make a small handful of recordings in January 1990). She published a memoir, &quot;Full Circle&quot;, in 1982. In 1991, Baker was elected Chancellor of the University of York. She held the position until 2004, when she was succeeded by Greg Dyke. An enthusiastic Patron of the Leeds International Pianoforte Competition, she gave an address at the closing ceremony of the 2009 event.

==Honours and awards==
Janet Baker was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1970 and appointed to Dame Commander (DBE) in 1976. She was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in 1993. In 1968, she was initiated as an Honorary Member of Sigma Alpha Iota International Music Fraternity by the Alpha Omicron chapter at Occidental College, California, United States. In 1971, the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded her its annual Shakespeare Prize. She received the Léonie Sonning Music Prize of Denmark in 1979. She is the recipient of both Honorary Membership (1987) and the Gold Medal (1990) of the Royal Philharmonic Society. She has been a vice-president of The Bach Choir since 1983. In 2007, she received the Distinguished Musician Award from the Incorporated Society of Musicians and in 2011 she was installed as an Honorary Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Musicians at a ceremony in the City of London. This is the highest honour the company can bestow on a fellow musician. She was awarded a Fellowship by the Royal Northern College of Music (FRNCM) in 1978.

She was voted into &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine&#x27;s inaugural Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Private life==
She married James Keith Shelley in 1957 in Harrow; he became her manager and accompanied her to engagements. They decided not to have children for the sake of her career. Following her retirement as a singer, she did perform and record some spoken roles, for example the role of the narrator in Britten&#x27;s incidental music for &quot;The Rescue of Penelope&quot;; in later years, apart from occasional public appearances such as the 2009 Leeds event, she said she had &quot;nothing to do with anyone except close friends&quot;. Those friends include the singer Felicity Lott, pianist Imogen Cooper, conductor Jane Glover and actress Patricia Routledge, all of whom appeared in a BBC documentary profile, &quot;Janet Baker in her own words&quot;, shown in 2019. After her husband suffered a stroke, she cared for him at home. He died in June 2019.

<text>Joan Christabel Jill Knight, Baroness Knight of Collingtree, (; 9 July 1923 – 6 April 2022) was a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, she served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Edgbaston from 1966 to 1997. She was created a life peer as Baroness Knight of Collingtree, of Collingtree in the County of Northamptonshire, in 1997 after she had stood down at that year&#x27;s general election, and retired from the House of Lords in 2016.

==Early life==
Joan Christabel Jill Christie was born in Bristol on 9 July 1923, although she later shaved several years off her age: when seeking election, she put her year of birth as 1930. Her parents divorced when she was a child. Her mother was a teacher and a graduate of Bristol University. Christie attended Fairfield Secondary and Higher Grade School in Bristol and the King Edward Grammar School for Girls, Birmingham. In 1941, she joined the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). Her unit served in Amiens, moving later to Hamburg, following the British advance, performing ground control of aircraft. She also appeared on British Forces Network radio.

Upon her return to the UK, she joined the Young Conservatives in London. On 14 June 1947, she married James Montague &quot;Monty&quot; Knight (an optician, who had served in the war as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy), and moved to Northampton.

==Political career==
She was elected as a councillor on Northampton Borough Council, serving from 1956 to 1966, and became a whip. She unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary seat of Northampton at the 1959 and 1964 general elections for the Conservative Party. She was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Edgbaston in the 1966 general election, and held that seat in successive elections for 31 years until she stood down at the 1997 election. She was one of the longest serving female MPs in British history. The Conservative MP for Edgbaston, Dame Edith Pitt, had died on 27 January 1966 and it was the first time that a female Member of Parliament had been succeeded by another woman.

Knight was a member of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Race Relations and Immigration, 1969–72. For more than two decades she was an active member of the Conservative Monday Club and was an outspoken opponent of the Irish Republican Army. Following the February 1972 Aldershot bombing by the IRA she called for legislation to outlaw the IRA, and attacked its supporters and sympathisers.

She was on the Select Committee for the Council of Europe from 1977, the Select Committee for Home Affairs from 1980 to 1983, Lady Chairman of the Lords and Commons All-Party Child and Family Protection Group from 1978, on the Conservative Back-bench Health and Social Services Committee from 1982 and Secretary to the 1922 Committee from 1983 to 1987. Knight was President of the West Midlands Conservative Political Centre from 1980 to 1983, and Lady Chairman of the Western European Union Relations with Parliaments Committee from 1984 to 1988. She also served on the Council of Europe (1977–88), and as Chairman of the British Inter-Parliamentary Union (1994–97).

One slogan in the aftermath of the New Cross house fire, which left 13 young Black Britons dead, read: &quot;Dame Jill Knight Set The Fire Alight!&quot;; this was an apparent reference to a controversial speech by Knight which was widely interpreted as condoning or even encouraging direct action against noisy parties.

Knight was created a Life peer as Baroness Knight of Collingtree, of Collingtree in the County of Northamptonshire in 1997 after standing down at that year&#x27;s general election, and retired from the House of Lords on 24 March 2016, the week of the 50th anniversary of her first election to Parliament. She was Vice-Chairman of the Association of Conservative Peers from 2002 to 2005.

Her memoirs, &quot;About the House&quot;, were published in 1995. She was interviewed in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project.

=== Section 28 ===
Knight, along with David Wilshire, introduced the Section 28 amendment to the Local Government Act 1988, which barred local authorities, including schools, from &#x27;promoting&#x27; homosexuality. While promoting the new clause, Knight claimed children under two had access to gay and lesbian books in Lambeth, a claim which has never been substantiated. She linked discussion of homosexuality in schools to the spread of AIDS, also describing homosexuality as &quot;perverted&quot; and &quot;desperately dangerous&quot;. She was described as a key force behind the legislation and a &quot;dedicated – not to say fanatical – anti-gay MP&quot;.

In June 2013, Knight opposed same-sex marriage legislation, arguing that Parliament cannot change the fact that &quot;marriage is not about just love. It is about a man and a woman, themselves created to produce children, producing children. A man can no more bear a child, than a woman can produce sperm, and no law on earth can change that. This is not a homophobic view. It may be sad, it may be unequal, but it&#x27;s true.&quot; In the same year, she claimed it was wrong for the Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron to apologise for the legacy of Section 28, while appearing to defend herself from accusations of homophobia by claiming that gay people are &quot;very good at antiques&quot;.

In 2018, when she was interviewed by former &quot;Attitude&quot; magazine editor Matthew Todd, who confronted Knight about her role as an architect of and a main driving force behind Section 28, she said &quot;I&#x27;m sorry if anything I did upset you. All I was trying to do was acting on what people wrote to me, said to me, what the papers said.&quot; Knight stated that her motivation had only been to maintain the welfare of children.

==Outside Parliament==
From 1986 to 1995, Knight was Vice-President of Townswomen&#x27;s Guilds. She was director of Computeach International plc from 1991 to 2006 and Heckett Multiserv from 1999 to 2006. Knight has been President of Sulgrave Manor Trust since 2012; she was its Chairman from 2007 to 2012.

==Honours==
Knight was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1964, and elevated to a Dame Commander in 1985. She was awarded an honorary DSc by Aston University in 1999. Knight was made a Kentucky Colonel in 1973; a Nebraska Admiral in 1980; and was made an honorary Texas Ranger in 2014.

==Personal life and death==
Knight&#x27;s husband, James Montague Knight, died in 1986. The couple had two children. Her recreations were music, reading, tapestry work, theatre-going and antique-hunting. Knight died in West Northamptonshire, on 6 April 2022, at the age of 98.

<doc id="469590" wikidata="Q333749" url="?curid=469590" title="George Goschen, 1st Viscount Goschen">
<text>George Joachim Goschen, 1st Viscount Goschen (10 August 1831 – 7 February 1907) was a British statesman and businessman best remembered for being &quot;forgotten&quot; by Lord Randolph Churchill. He was initially a Liberal, then a Liberal Unionist before joining the Conservative Party in 1893.

While Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1888, he introduced the Goschen formula to allocate funding for Scotland and Ireland.

==Background, education and business career==
He was born in London, the son of Wilhelm Heinrich (William Henry) Goschen, who emigrated from Leipzig. His grandfather was the prominent German printer Georg Joachim Göschen. He was educated at Rugby under Tait, and at Oriel College, Oxford, where he took a first in Literae Humaniores and served as President of the Oxford Union. He entered his father&#x27;s firm of ″Frühling &amp; Göschen″, of Austin Friars, in 1853, and three years later became a director of the Bank of England. From 1874 to 1880, Goschen was Governor (Company chairman) of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, North America&#x27;s oldest company (established by English royal charter in 1670).

== Political career, 1863–1885 ==
In 1863 he was returned without opposition as one of the four MPs for the City of London in the Liberal interest, and he was reelected in 1865. In November of the same year he was appointed Vice-President of the Board of Trade and Paymaster General, and in January 1866 he was made Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, with a seat in the cabinet. When Gladstone became prime minister in December 1868, Goschen joined the cabinet as President of the Poor Law Board, until March 1871, when he succeeded Childers as First Lord of the Admiralty. In the 1874 general election he was the only Liberal returned for the City of London, and by a narrow majority. Being sent to Cairo in 1876 as delegate for the British holders of Egyptian bonds in 1876, he concluded an agreement with the Khedive to arrange for the conversion of the debt.

In 1878 his views on the county franchise question prevented him from voting consistently with his party. With the City of London becoming more Conservative, Goschen did not stand there at the 1880 general election, but was instead returned for Ripon in Yorkshire, which he represented until 1885, when he was returned for Edinburgh East. He declined to join Gladstone&#x27;s government in 1880 and refused the post of Viceroy of India, but he became special ambassador to the Porte, where he settled the Montenegrin and Greek frontier questions in 1880 and 1881. He was made an Ecclesiastical Commissioner in 1882. When Sir Henry Brand was raised to the peerage in 1884, Goschen was offered the role of Speaker of the House of Commons, but he declined. During the parliament of 1880–1885 he frequently found himself at odds with his party, especially over franchise extension and questions of foreign policy. When Gladstone adopted Home Rule for Ireland, Goschen followed Lord Hartington (afterwards 8th Duke of Devonshire) and became one of the most active of the Liberal Unionists. He failed to retain his seat for Edinburgh at the election in July of that year.

==Political career, 1885–1895==
On the resignation of Lord Randolph Churchill in December 1886, Goschen, though a Liberal Unionist, accepted Lord Salisbury&#x27;s invitation to join his ministry as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Churchill had assumed he could not be replaced and famously commented that he had &quot;forgotten Goschen&quot; was a potential alternative. Goschen needed a seat in Parliament and so stood in a by-election in the Liverpool Exchange constituency but was defeated by seven votes in January 1887. He was then elected for the strongly-Conservative St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, in February. His chancellorship was memorable for his successful conversion of the National Debt in 1888. He also introduced the first UK road tax, implemented in the form of two vehicle duties, on locomotives and carts.

According to Roy Jenkins, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, &quot;Whether Goschen was a good Chancellor is more problematical. His main and real achievement was the conversion in 1888 of the core of the national debt from a 3 percent to a 2.75 percent and ultimately 2.5 percent basis. For the rest he was a stolid and uninnovating Chancellor.&quot; Professor Thomas Skinner wrote, &quot;Yet there remains a feeling that he failed to accomplish much of what needed to be done&quot;.

The University of Aberdeen again conferred upon him the honour of the rectorship in 1888, he received an honorary LL.D from the University of Cambridge in the same year, and he received a similar honour from the University of Edinburgh in 1890.

Following the defeat of Salisbury&#x27;s government in 1892, Goschen moved into opposition. Though he had been a leading Liberal Unionist as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Goschen did not stand against Joseph Chamberlain for the leadership of the party in 1892 following the departure of Hartington to the House of Lords as the Duke of Devonshire. Unable to work with Chamberlain, Goschen left the Liberal Unionists and joined the Conservatives in 1893. One obvious sign of his change of allegiance within the Unionist alliance was when he joined the exclusively Conservative Carlton Club in the same year.

==Political career, 1895–1907==

From 1895 to 1900 Goschen was First Lord of the Admiralty. He retired in 1900 and was raised to the peerage as Viscount Goschen of Hawkhurst, Kent. Though retired from active politics he continued to take a great interest in public affairs, and when Chamberlain started his tariff reform movement in 1903, Lord Goschen was one of the weightiest champions of free trade on the Unionist side.

==Other public positions==
In educational subjects Goschen had always taken the greatest interest, his best known, but by no means his only, contribution to popular culture being his participation in the University Extension Movement. His first efforts in parliament were devoted to advocating the abolition of religious tests and the admission of Dissenters to the universities. His published works indicate how ably he combined the wise study of economics with a practical instinct for business-like progress, without neglecting the more ideal aspects of human life. In addition to his well-known work on &quot;The Theory of Foreign Exchanges&quot;, he published several financial and political pamphlets and addresses on educational and social subjects, among them being,&quot;The Cultivation of the Imagination&quot;, Liverpool, 1877, and that on &quot;Intellectual Interest&quot;, Aberdeen, 1888. He was President of the Royal Statistical Society, 1886–88.

He also wrote a biography of his grandfather, &quot;The Life and Times of George Joachim Goschen, publisher and printer of Leipzig&quot; (1903). This culminated a long-standing project to refute allegations of Jewish ancestry, giving his earliest ascertainable ancestor as a Lutheran pastor named Joachimus Gosenius, recorded in 1609. However, it did not prevent his family from being erroneously classed as of Jewish origin in the German genealogical work known as &quot;The Semi Gotha&quot;, first published 1913.

==Private life==
Goschen died on 7 February 1907. He had married, in 1857, Lucy, the daughter of John Dalley, and had 6 children. He was succeeded by his eldest son George (1866–1952), who was also a Conservative politician, served as Governor of Madras and married the daughter of Lord Cranbrook.

==Cultural references==
* Goschen appears as a minor character in the historical-mystery novel &quot;Stone&#x27;s Fall&quot;, by Iain Pears.
* He is referenced in the poem &quot;Away from It All&quot; by New Zealand poet A. R. D. Fairburn:
&lt;poem&gt;I want to leave behind me all rancid emotion.
I want to be alone. I want to forget Goschen.&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="469603" wikidata="Q1139877" url="?curid=469603" title="Lunar Strain">
<text>Lunar Strain is the debut studio album by Swedish melo death band In Flames, released in April 1994. The album is known for its &quot;folky elements&quot;, with the inclusion of violins and acoustic guitars along with influences from black metal.

It is the only In Flames album to not feature Anders Fridén as the vocalist and Björn Gelotte as either drummer or lead guitarist. Guitarist Jesper Strömblad plays the drums, while the vocals are sung by Dark Tranquillity vocalist Mikael Stanne, a session musician for In Flames at the time. Stanne had sung with the band previously on &quot;Demo &#x27;93&quot;. Coincidentally, Fridén was the original vocalist for Dark Tranquillity and he effectively traded places with Stanne in 1995. As of 2010, no members who played on this album are still with the band.

The songs &quot;Behind Space&quot; and &quot;Clad in Shadows&quot; were re-recorded in the album &quot;Colony&quot; (1999), featuring In Flames&#x27; future lineup; both songs were renamed with the suffix &#x27;99 at the end of the title. &quot;Clad in Shadows &#x27;99&quot; was also released on the reissue of the album &quot;Whoracle&quot; (1997).

==Reissues==
In 1999, the album was re-released under the title &quot;Lunar Strain – Subterranean&quot;, including all tracks from the band&#x27;s future release, &quot;Subterranean&quot;.

On the 2003 &quot;Regain Records&quot; re-release, the songs order differs slightly, with &quot;Clad in Shadows&quot; being the second track, shifting the rest down by one. However, the discrepancy is not apparent in the album&#x27;s track listing. Track 10, on the original release &quot;Clad in Shadows&quot;, became Track 2 (this was not shown on the album&#x27;s track list), and each track after track 2 ended up being credited as the track before (i.e. &quot;Clad in Shadows&quot; is credited as &quot;Lunar Strain&quot;, and so on).

The album was re-released and remastered with bonus tracks in 2004 via Regain Records and in 2005 via Candlelight Records, featuring the same artwork but a more modern logo, as seen on &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot; and &quot;Come Clarity&quot;. The bonus tracks are actually three songs re-recorded from the band&#x27;s 1993 demo, which contained &quot;alternative mixed versions of the album recordings.&quot;

<doc id="469604" wikidata="Q48753447" url="?curid=469604" title="Jerrycan">
<text>A jerrycan or jerrican (also styled jerry can or jerri can) is a fuel container made from pressed steel (and more recently, high density polyethylene). It was designed in Germany in the 1930s for military use to hold of fuel, and saw widespread use by both Germany and the Allies during the Second World War.

The development of the jerrycan was a significant improvement on earlier designs, which required tools and funnels to use, and it contained many innovative features for convenience of use and robustness. Today similar designs are used worldwide for fuel and water containers, in both military and civilian contexts. The designs usually emulate the original steel design, though some are also produced in plastic.

== History ==

The name of the jerrycan refers to its German origins, &quot;Jerry&quot; being slang for Germans. The design was reverse engineered and subsequently copied, with minor modifications, by the Allies during the Second World War.

=== German invention ===
The &quot;Wehrmacht-Einheitskanister&quot;, as it was known in Germany, was first developed in 1937 by the Müller engineering firm in Schwelm to a design by their chief engineer Vinzenz Grünvogel. A similar design was used in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, where they had a company logo for Ambi-Budd Presswerk GmbH. Among others, the Wehrmacht had specified that a soldier should be able to carry either two full containers or four empty ones, which is the reason the triple handles were fitted. To achieve the required filling and draining speed, it was fitted with a large spout and flip top closure. A hole in the closure retainer made it possible to fit a securing pin or wire with a lead seal. The rectangular shape made it stackable. The recessed welded seam stiffened the container and protected the seam from impact damage. The indentations ensured a full can would not be severely damaged when falling from a vehicle, while a dip coat of paint on the inside protected it from corrosion.

By 1939 the German military had thousands of such cans stockpiled in anticipation of war. Motorised troops were issued the cans with lengths of rubber hose in order to siphon fuel from any available source, a way to aid their rapid invasion of Poland at the start of the Second World War.

=== American adaptation ===
In 1939, American engineer Paul Pleiss had built a vehicle to journey to India with his German colleague. After building the car, they realised they did not have any storage for emergency water. The German engineer had access to the stockpile of jerrycans at Berlin Tempelhof Airport and managed to take three of them. The German engineer also gave Pleiss complete specifications for the manufacture of the can. Pleiss continued on to Calcutta, put his car in storage, and flew back to Philadelphia, where he told American military officials about the can. He could raise no interest. Without a sample, he realised he could not get anywhere. He eventually shipped the car to New York by a roundabout method, and sent a can to Washington. The War Department decided instead to use World War I cans with two screw closures, which required both a spanner and funnel for pouring.

The one jerrycan in American possession was sent to Camp Holabird, Maryland, where it was redesigned. The new design retained the handles, size and shape, but is most easily distinguishable from the German original by the simplified &#x27;X&#x27; - stiffening indentations in the sides of the can. The US can could be stacked interchangeably with German or British cans. The German recessed welded seam was replaced with rolled seams which were prone to leakage. For fuel cans, the lining was removed and a spanner and funnel were required. A similar water can was also adopted, with a flip-top lid and enamel lining.

The US-designed jerrycan was widely used by US Army and Marine Corps units. In all overseas theaters, fuel and other petroleum products represented about 50% of all supply needs, measured by weight. In the European Theatre of Operations alone, over 19 million were required to support US forces by May 1945.

The jerrycan played an important role in ensuring fuel supply to Allied operations. A single standard US 2.5 ton truck could carry of fuel loaded in jerrycans. US logisticians requested over 1.3 million per month to replace losses; these cans were provided by US and British manufacturers, but supply could not keep up with demand. Loss of jerrycans in units was severe, with 3.5 million reported &#x27;lost&#x27; in October 1944, for example. At one point in August 1944, lack of cans (caused by losses) limited the supply of fuel that could be brought forward to combat units, even though the fuel was available in rear areas.

The US design was slightly lighter than the German can ( vs. for the German version). These fuel containers were subsequently used in all theatres of war around the world. Such was the appreciation of the cans in the war effort that President Franklin Roosevelt noted, &quot;Without these cans it would have been impossible for our armies to cut their way across France at a lightning pace which exceeded the German Blitzkrieg of 1940.&quot;

=== British necessity ===
At the beginning of the Second World War the British Army was equipped with two simple fuel containers: the container made of pressed steel, and the container made from tin plate. The 2-gallon containers were relatively strong, but were expensive to produce. Manufactured primarily in Egypt, the 4-gallon containers were plentiful and inexpensive, but they had a tendency to leak after minor damage. Early 4-gallon containers were packed in pairs in wooden cases. When stacked, the timber framing protected the tins and prevented the upper layers of tins from crushing the lower. As the war progressed, the wooden case was replaced with either thin plywood or cardboard cases, neither of which provided much protection. 4-gallon containers carrying fuel were hazardous to the cargo ships carrying them. The leaking fuel would accumulate in cargo holds. At least one such ship exploded.

Though adequate for transport along European roads, the four-gallon containers proved extremely unsatisfactory during the North African Campaign. The crimped or soldered seams easily split during transport, especially off-road over the rock-strewn deserts of North Africa. In addition, the containers were easily punctured by even minor trauma. Because of these problems the troops referred to the 4-gallon containers as &quot;flimsies&quot;. Transport of fuel over rough terrain often resulted in as much as 25% of the fuel being lost through seam failures or punctures. Fuel leaks gave vehicles a propensity to catch fire. The containers were routinely discarded after a single use, and severely hampered the operation of the British Eighth Army. A more successful and popular use for the 4-gallon container was to convert it into a cooking stove, referred to as the &#x27;Benghazi burner&#x27;.

When the British Army first saw the German fuel cans during the Norwegian Campaign in 1940, they immediately saw the advantages of the superior design. The three handles allowed easy handling by one or two people, or movement bucket brigade-style. The handle design also allows for two empty cans to be carried in each hand, utilizing the outer handle.

The sides of the can were marked with cross-like indentations that strengthened the can while allowing the contents to expand, as did an air pocket under the handles when the can was filled correctly. This air pocket allowed the container to float if dropped in water. Rather than a screw cap, the containers used a cam lever release mechanism with a short spout secured with a snap closure and an air-pipe to the air pocket which enabled smooth pouring (which was omitted in some copies). The interior was also lined with an impervious plastic, first developed for steel beer barrels, that would allow the can to be used for either water or petrol. The can was welded and had a gasket for a leak-proof mouth.

The British used cans captured from the &quot;Jerries&quot; (slang for Germans), hence &quot;jerrycans&quot;, in preference to their own containers as much as possible. Later in 1940, Pleiss was in London and British officers asked him about the design and manufacture of the jerrycan. Pleiss ordered the second of his three jerrycans flown to London. After the second capture of Benghazi at the end of 1941, large numbers of Axis jerrycans were captured, sufficient to equip some units such as the Long Range Desert Group.

British companies such as Briggs Motor Bodies, Vauxhall Motors and the Pressed Steel Company manufactured copies of the German design.

=== Soviet usage ===

The strength of the &quot;Wehrmachtskanister&quot; was also recognised in the Soviet Union. Its design was later copied and the Soviet Army accepted it as the standard container for liquids. This container is still being produced and used in modern Russia. In civilian use this container is used primarily for automotive fuel and lubricants.

== Design ==
Jerrycans typically have a rounded rectangular cross section with package handles. Most have three handles: a center handle for one person carrying a lightweight can, two handles for a person lifting a full can, or two handles for two people to carry. The configuration of the three handles allows two empty jerrycans to be carried in one hand.

The cans were originally intended to be used as fuel containers, but uses for the cans have expanded beyond this. Today, a can&#x27;s use is denoted by its colouring, affixed labels and, occasionally, imprinted labelling on the container itself. This is to prevent contamination of the can&#x27;s contents by mixing different fuels or mixing fuel with water.

The US version of the jerrycan is covered by military specification MIL-C-1283 F and has been produced since the early 1940s by a number of US manufacturers, according to a current manufacturer, Blitz. The National Stock Number is 7240-00-222-3088. It is considered obsolete by a new A-A-59592 B specification, having been replaced with high-density polyethylene versions.

== Modern use ==
The German design jerrycan is still a standard container for fuel and other liquids in the armies of the NATO countries.

Finnish designer Eero Rislakki designed a plastic jerrycan in 1970 with a small screwable stopper on the top side behind the handle to allow air flowing in to ensure smooth fuel outflow. It is lighter than the original design yet almost as sturdy. It was quickly adopted by the Finnish armed forces, and is commercially available. 

== Current regulations ==

In the United States, the jerrycan is defined by the Code of Federal Regulation, 49 CFR 171.8 as &quot;a metal or plastic packaging of rectangular or polygonal cross-section&quot;. all portable fuel containers are required to conform to two new regulations:

# They must meet new federal Mobile Source Air Toxics regulations, based on the California Air Resources Board&#x27;s regulations.
# They must meet the requirements of the Children&#x27;s Gasoline Burn Prevention Act.

These new regulations do not apply to OSHA-approved metal safety containers, but rather to the common red plastic, portable gas cans. The regulations apply only to newly manufactured petrol cans, and there is no requirement on the part of users to discard their existing cans or to upgrade, although the EPA provides informational resources for implementing community Gas Can Exchange Programs. Furthermore, in the state of California, the following colours are mandated:

Per ASTM F852, the particular shades should be &quot;medium yellow&quot; and &quot;medium blue&quot;.

The transportation of dangerous goods (which includes liquid fuels) within Europe is governed by the UN &quot;European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road&quot; (ADR). The term &quot;jerrican&quot; is defined within Chapter 1.2 of the 2011 ADR as &quot;a metal or packaging of rectangular or polygonal cross-section with one or more orifices&quot;, a definition which includes the traditional jerrycan but which also covers a wide range of other packagings. The ADR sets performance standards for packaging and specifies what standard of packaging is required for each type of dangerous good, including petrol and diesel fuels. The traditional jerrycan is available in UN-marked approved versions which satisfy the requirements of the ADR.

<text>Black-Ash Inheritance is the second EP by Swedish heavy metal band In Flames, released in 1997. It was released as a preview of their upcoming album &quot;Whoracle&quot;. Its tracks were later included in the Japanese release of &quot;Whoracle&quot; as well as the later reissue of &quot;The Jester Race&quot;.

The title is a lyric from the song &quot;Dead God in Me&quot; from &quot;The Jester Race&quot;.

The &quot;Acoustic Medley&quot; is a medley of three In Flames songs; &quot;Artifacts of the Black Rain&quot; (&quot;The Jester Race&quot;), &quot;Dead Eternity&quot; (&quot;The Jester Race&quot;) and &quot;Jotun&quot; (&quot;Whoracle&quot;).

In 2007, &quot;Black-Ash Inheritance&quot; was re-released as a shaped mini-LP by Night of the Vinyl Dead Records, limited to 555 copies.

<text>Desktop Communication Protocol (DCOP) was an inter-process communication (IPC) daemon by KDE used in K Desktop Environment 3. The design goal for the protocol was to allow applications to interoperate, and share complex tasks. Essentially, DCOP was a ‘remote control’ system, which allowed applications or scripts to enlist the help of other applications. DCOP is built on top of the X11 Inter-Client Exchange protocol.

DCOP continues to be used by the K Desktop Environment 3-fork Trinity Desktop Environment. DCOP was replaced by D-Bus, a message bus system heavily influenced by the DCOP and standardized by freedesktop.org, in KDE Software Compilation 4 and later.

== DCOP model ==
DCOP implements the client–server model, where each application using DCOP is a client and communicates with other clients through the DCOP server. DCOP server functions like a traffic director, dispatching messages/calls to the proper destinations. All clients are peers of each other.

Two types of actions are possible with DCOP: &quot;send and forget&quot; messages, which do not block, and &quot;calls,&quot; which block waiting for some data to be returned.

Any data that will be sent is serialized (also referred to as &quot;marshalling&quot; in CORBA speak) using the built-in QDataStream operators available in all of the Qt classes. There is also a simple IDL-like compiler available (dcopidl and dcopidl2cpp) that generates stubs and skeletons. Using the dcopidl compiler has the additional benefit of type safety.

There is a command-line tool called ‘dcop’ (note the lower-case letters) that can be used for communication with the applications from the shell. ‘kdcop’ is a GUI tool to explore the interfaces of an application.

<doc id="469609" wikidata="Q903071" url="?curid=469609" title="Desiccation">
<text>Desiccation is the state of extreme dryness, or the process of extreme drying. A desiccant is a hygroscopic (attracts and holds water) substance that induces or sustains such a state in its local vicinity in a moderately sealed container. The word desiccation comes .

==Industry==
Desiccation is widely employed in the oil and gas industry. These materials are obtained in a hydrated state, but the water content leads to corrosion or is incompatible with downstream processing. Removal of water is achieved by cryogenic condensation, absorption into glycols, and absorption onto desiccants such as silica gel.

==Laboratory==
A desiccator is a heavy glass or plastic container, now somewhat antiquated, used in practical chemistry for drying or keeping small amounts of materials very dry. The material is placed on a shelf, and a drying agent or &quot;desiccant&quot;, such as dry silica gel or anhydrous sodium hydroxide, is placed below the shelf.

Often some sort of humidity indicator is included in the desiccator to show, by color changes, the level of humidity. These indicators are in the form of indicator plugs or indicator cards. The active chemical is cobalt chloride (CoCl2). Anhydrous cobalt chloride is blue. When it bonds with two water molecules, (CoCl2•2H2O), it turns purple. Further hydration results in the pink hexaaquacobalt(II) chloride complex [Co(H2O)6]2+.

==Biology and ecology==

In biology and ecology, desiccation refers to the drying out of a living organism, such as when aquatic animals are taken out of water, slugs are exposed to salt, or when plants are exposed to sunlight or drought. Ecologists frequently study and assess various organisms&#x27; susceptibility to desiccation. For example, in one study the investigators found that &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; dauer is a true anhydrobiote that can withstand extreme desiccation and that the basis of this ability is founded in the metabolism of trehalose.

===DNA damage and repair===
Several bacterial species have been shown to accumulate DNA damage upon desiccation. &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot; is extremely resistant to ionizing radiation. The functions necessary to survive ionizing radiation are also necessary to survive prolonged desiccation. Radiation resistance is considered to be an incidental consequence of the organism&#x27;s evolutionary adaptation to dehydration, a common physiological stress in nature. The chromosomal DNA from desiccated &quot;D. radiodurans&quot; revealed increased DNA double-strand breaks. DNA double-strand breaks are repaired principally by a RecA-dependent recombination process that requires the presence of two genome copies. By this process &quot;D. radiodurans&quot; can survive thousands of double-strand breaks per cell.

&quot;Mycobacterium smegmatis&quot; mutant strains that are deficient in the ability to repair double-strand breaks by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway are more sensitive to prolonged desiccation during stationary phase than wild-type strains. NHEJ appears to be the preferred pathway for repairing double-strand breaks caused by desiccation during the stationary phase. NHEJ can repair double-strand breaks even when only one chromosome is present in a cell.

Upon exposure to extreme dryness, &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; endospores acquire DNA-double strand breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks.

==Broadcasting==
In broadcast engineering, a desiccator may be used to pressurize the feedline of a high-power transmitter. Because it carries a large amount of energy from the transmitter to the antenna, the feedline must have low dielectric losses. Because it must also be lightweight so as not to overload the radio tower, air is often used as the dielectric. Since moisture can condense in these lines, desiccated air or nitrogen gas is pumped in. This pressure also keeps water or other dampness from coming into the line at any point along its length.

<doc id="469610" wikidata="Q282078" url="?curid=469610" title="Curt Hennig">
<text>Curtis Michael Hennig (March 28, 1958 – February 10, 2003), better known by the ring name Mr. Perfect, was an American professional wrestler. Considered one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time by peers, critics, and fans, he performed under his real name for promotions including the American Wrestling Association (AWA), the World Wrestling Federation (WWF; now WWE), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and NWA Total Nonstop Action. Hennig was the son of wrestler Larry &quot;The Axe&quot; Hennig and the father of wrestler Curtis Axel.

Hennig debuted in 1980 and won multiple championships in both Pacific Northwest Wrestling (PNW) and the AWA during the decade. He gained particular attention when he defeated Nick Bockwinkel for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship in 1987, with his 373-day reign being the seventh-longest in history. Hennig moved to the WWF thereafter, where he feuded with Hulk Hogan over the WWF Championship, and won the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship twice, becoming the longest-reigning titleholder of the 1990s. In addition to winning multiple titles in WCW during the late 1990s, Hennig challenged for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on pay-per-view (PPV), and led stable and country music group the West Texas Rednecks, who recorded the popular tongue-in-cheek song, &quot;Rap Is Crap&quot;. During a stint with the World Wrestling Council (WWC) in 2000, he won the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship. Hennig returned to the WWF/E for a brief period in 2002, being one of the last three men remaining at that year&#x27;s Royal Rumble. He later headlined multiple PPV events for TNA, in contention for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, prior to his death on February 10, 2003.

WWE credited Hennig for raising the standard of technical wrestling in that company, while professional wrestling journalists Bob Ryder and Dave Scherer, in a 2000 publication, recognized him as &quot;one of the best all-round competitors this business has ever produced&quot;. Hennig was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007 by former Major League Baseball player and longtime friend Wade Boggs. Hulk Hogan remarked, &quot;Everybody would check their egos at the door when they came to a building that Curt Hennig was in, because you couldn&#x27;t out-work him, you couldn&#x27;t outshine him, and you couldn&#x27;t out-perform him. He was the best of the best.&quot;

== Early life ==

Curt Hennig was born on March 28, 1958, the son of professional wrestler Larry &quot;The Axe&quot; Hennig. Hennig was childhood friends with fellow wrestler Rick Rude. They attended Robbinsdale High School in his hometown of Robbinsdale, Minnesota, alongside Tom Zenk, Brady Boone, Nikita Koloff, John Nord, Road Warrior Hawk, and Barry Darsow, who all became professional wrestlers.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== American Wrestling Association (1980–1982) ===
Known as &quot;Cool&quot; Curt Hennig, he began his career on January 30, 1980, in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), the promotion which had made his father, Larry &quot;The Axe&quot; Hennig a star.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1981–1983) ===
Hennig started his WWF career in 1981. His first victory was against Johnny Rodz. He established himself as a promising young performer against the likes of &quot;Playboy&quot; Buddy Rose, Greg Valentine and Killer Khan. Eventually, he was paired-up in tag team matches with another young upstart, Eddie Gilbert, himself the son of a wrestling legend (Tommy Gilbert).

=== Pacific Northwest Wrestling (1982–1988) ===

In 1982, Hennig teamed up with his father, Larry, and won the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship defeating Rip Oliver and Matt Borne on April 27. He later won the titles with Buddy Rose and Scott McGhee in 1983. He also won the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship in 1983, after defeating Sheik Abdullah Ali Hassan. He lost the title to The Dynamite Kid three months later. From 1984 to 1988 he made occasional appearances for the company. During this time he worked for New Japan Pro-Wrestling and various territories such as NWA St. Louis, Central States Wrestling and Continental Wrestling Association.

=== Return to AWA (1983–1988) ===
Hennig returned to the American Wrestling Association in 1983. He would eventually become one of the promotion&#x27;s top stars in his own right, winning the AWA World Tag Team Championship with Scott Hall by defeating &quot;Gorgeous&quot; Jimmy Garvin and &quot;Mr. Electricity&quot; Steve Regal on January 18, 1986, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Later, he resumed his solo career in the AWA, culminating in defeating the legendary Nick Bockwinkel for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship at SuperClash on May 2, 1987, with the help of Larry Zbyszko, and turning villain in doing so. Hennig, along with his father Larry &quot;The Axe&quot;, would engage in a long feud with Greg Gagne and his father, Verne Gagne. He began being associated with Madusa Miceli, the AWA World Women&#x27;s Champion since December 27, 1987. Hennig and Madusa joined The Diamond Exchange, a stable led by Diamond Dallas Page that also included Badd Company and Colonel DeBeers.

Hennig would hold the AWA World Heavyweight Title for about 53 weeks, before losing it to Jerry Lawler on May 9, 1988. Like many other AWA stars of the time (including Hulk Hogan, Rick Martel, and The Rockers), Hennig left the AWA for the WWF with the promise of more money and broadened exposure.

=== Return to WWF (1988–1996) ===
==== Undefeated streak (1988–1990) ====
Hennig returned to the WWF in mid-1988. Hennig made his televised in-ring return on the September 11 episode of &quot;All-American Wrestling&quot;, defeating enhancement talent Ron Rovishod. On the October 1 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, vignettes began airing on WWF television, during which he was repackaged with a new character of an arrogant braggart villain who claimed to be able to accomplish difficult tasks &quot;perfectly&quot;, thus earning the nickname of &quot;Mr. Perfect. He presented himself as being superior in athletics or anything else he did. These clips showed him hitting half-court, three-point, and no-look basketball shots, bowling a score of 300, running the table in billiards, throwing then catching his own Hail Mary football pass, sinking a long golf putt, hitting home runs and making bulls-eyes in darts. Stars of various major league sports, including Wade Boggs (MLB), Steve Jordan (NFL), Felton Spencer (NBA), and Mike Modano (NHL), co-starred with Hennig in these vignettes. Hennig performed for the first time as Mr. Perfect on the October 4 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, where he defeated Jim Brunzell.

His first major PPV match was at &quot;Survivor Series 1988&quot; in a five-on-five elimination tag team match as a member of co-captain André the Giant&#x27;s team, along with Rick Rude, Dino Bravo (also co-captain) and Harley Race against co-captain Jim Duggan&#x27;s team of Jake Roberts (also co-captain), Ken Patera, Tito Santana and Scott Casey. Perfect survived the match with Bravo. The following year, he appeared in SummerSlam, defeating The Red Rooster in a squash match. He went undefeated on television for over a year, beating mid-card wrestlers including B. Brian Blair, Ronnie Garvin, Koko B. Ware, The Blue Blazer, The Red Rooster, Jimmy Snuka, Tito Santana, and Bret Hart throughout 1989.

On the October 7 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, Perfect began appearing with The Genius, an arrogant, poetry-reciting scholar on &quot;The Brother Love Show&quot; and began a rivalry with Hulk Hogan over the WWF Championship. Their rivalry heated up when Genius defeated Hogan by countout, with Hennig&#x27;s assistance on November 25 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXIV&quot; and the duo stole Hogan&#x27;s title belt and destroyed it backstage. Perfect and Hogan wrestled on the live events, where he lost to Hogan but they did not compete on television until January 15, 1990, when Hennig received his first opportunity for the WWF Championship against Hogan at Madison Square Garden and this was his first televised match against Hogan, which he won by disqualification but not the title.

At Royal Rumble, Perfect attacked Genius&#x27;s opponent Brutus Beefcake after their match, which began a feud between the two. Later in the same night, Perfect participated in the Royal Rumble match as the No. 30 entrant. He eliminated Rick Rude before making it to the final two, where he was eliminated by Hogan. Perfect&#x27;s undefeated streak ended when he suffered his first pinfall loss on regional television against the Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior on March 19, at Madison Square Garden. His first loss in singles competition on national television was against Brutus Beefcake at WrestleMania VI. Hogan settled the score with Perfect with a match between the pair on April 28&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXVI&quot;, in which Hogan pinned Perfect for the first time on television. Following his loss to Hogan, Perfect quietly ended his association with The Genius.

==== Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion (1990–1991) ====
In May 1990, Perfect participated in a tournament for the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship after previous champion Ultimate Warrior vacated the title upon winning the WWF Championship at WrestleMania VI. Hennig was booked to win the tournament for the vacant title by defeating Jimmy Snuka in the quarter-finals on the May 5 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot; and two-time Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Tito Santana in the finals on May 19&#x27;s episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;. After his title win, Perfect enlisted Bobby Heenan as his &quot;perfect&quot; manager and made a successful title defense against Santana on July 28&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXVII&quot;. Hennig was scheduled to defend the title against Brutus Beefcake at SummerSlam, stemming from his loss to Beefcake at WrestleMania but Beefcake suffered an injury and The Texas Tornado substituted for Beefcake and challenged Hennig to a title match for SummerSlam on August 11&#x27;s episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, which Perfect accepted on the following week&#x27;s &quot;Superstars&quot;. Perfect dropped the championship to Texas Tornado at SummerSlam. Hennig was chosen to lead Demolition as &quot;The Perfect Team&quot; against The Warriors (Ultimate Warrior, Texas Tornado and Legion of Doom) in a four-on-four elimination tag team match at the Survivor Series pay-per-view, where Hennig&#x27;s team lost. He unsuccessfully challenged Texas Tornado in a rematch for the Intercontinental Championship on November 24 MSG Network special, before regaining the title by defeating Texas Tornado on the December 15 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, with help from Ted DiBiase. Perfect defended the title against Texas Tornado in a rematch on the February 2, 1991, episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, where he retained the title by losing via countout.

Perfect made his next title defense against Big Boss Man at WrestleMania VII, where he retained the title by losing via disqualification after the challenger was attacked by Haku and The Barbarian. The following month, Perfect won a battle royal on April 27&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot; by last eliminating Greg Valentine, which led to a match between the two for Perfect&#x27;s title on the May 14 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, where Perfect retained the title via disqualification. On a June 15 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, Bobby Heenan retired as a manager and introduced The Coach as Hennig&#x27;s new manager. Hennig began a rivalry with British Bulldog but suffered a back injury in late June, which led to the rivalry being wrapped up. Bret Hart was announced as his next challenger on the July 13 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, and in the meantime Hennig was held out of all house shows, usually replaced by Typhoon. On television, he wrestled a few preliminary opponents, but to avoid stressing his back with the Perfectplex, adopted the gimmick of throwing his opposition out of the ring in disgust and defeating them by countout. Perfect lost the title to Hart at SummerSlam and a broken tailbone and bulged discs forced him to retire from the ring.

==== Various storylines and departure (1991–1996) ====
Hennig spent the following year recovering from his injury. He returned to television on November 23 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot; where he became Ric Flair&#x27;s &quot;executive consultant&quot;. The following week on &quot;Superstars&quot;, Perfect became a color commentator of the show for the next full year, acting as a suitable villainous foil to Vince McMahon&#x27;s play-by-play. During this period, Perfect assisted Flair in winning matches and managed him to two World Heavyweight Championship reigns in 1992. By the fall of 1992, Perfect and Flair were in the midst of a rivalry with Randy Savage, building to a tag team match at Survivor Series where Flair and Razor Ramon would face Savage and Ultimate Warrior. However, Warrior was released from the WWF weeks prior to the event. On November 16 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, Savage asked Perfect to be his partner. After initially laughing off Savage&#x27;s offer, Perfect was swayed by Savage&#x27;s cajoling and by Bobby Heenan&#x27;s degrading comments and commanding Perfect to follow orders, which would lead to Perfect turning into a fan favorite for the first time in WWF by dumping water on Heenan and accepting Savage&#x27;s offer to return to the ring and become his partner at Survivor Series, much to the delight of the &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot; cast of Hillbilly Jim, Jim Duggan, and Vince McMahon. Hennig made his return to the ring at Survivor Series, where Hennig and Savage won their match.

Perfect began a high-profile rivalry with Flair. He made his return to singles competition on the January 2, 1993, episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, where he defeated The Berzerker. Hennig participated in the 1993 Royal Rumble match to determine the No. 1 contender for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania IX. He eliminated Flair, Skinner and Jerry Lawler until he was eliminated by Ted DiBiase, Koko B. Ware and Lawler. Hennig defeated Flair the next night on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; in a match where the loser would be forced to leave WWF. As a result, Flair left WWF. He then went on to feud with the debuting Lex Luger, who berated Perfect during his promos. Luger won their match at WrestleMania IX though both of Perfect&#x27;s feet were clearly between the ropes. Afterwards, Perfect chased Luger backstage where he was jumped from behind by Luger&#x27;s ally Shawn Michaels. As a result, Perfect began a rivalry with Michaels.

During this time, Hennig qualified for the first-ever televised King of the Ring tournament by defeating Doink the Clown. At King of the Ring, Perfect defeated Mr. Hughes in the quarter-finals but lost to eventual winner Bret Hart in the semi-finals. Perfect competed against Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship at SummerSlam, where Perfect lost by countout due to interference from Michaels&#x27; new bodyguard Diesel. Hennig&#x27;s last televised match in WWF was on November 7 episode of &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;, where he defeated Iron Mike Sharpe. He was set to participate as a member of Razor Ramon&#x27;s team at Survivor Series, but was replaced in the match by Randy Savage. Ramon took the microphone before the match saying Perfect was &quot;such a Perfect partner&quot; that he tagged out before the match had even begun.

Perfect made his surprise return to WWF at WrestleMania X on March 20, 1994, where he was the special guest referee for the WWF Championship match between Lex Luger and Yokozuna. Perfect disqualified Luger after Luger manhandled Perfect, who was tending to Yokozuna&#x27;s stricken managers Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji instead of counting the pinfall and turned heel again. Perfect was set to start another rivalry with Luger, during which he explained that he screwed Luger because of Luger&#x27;s illegal win over Perfect the previous year at WrestleMania IX. However, plans were scrapped after Hennig&#x27;s back problems flared up again. He left the WWF in the spring of 1994.

Hennig took a year off to recover from a back injury until he returned to the company as a color commentator at the Survivor Series pay-per-view in 1995. The following weekend, Jerry Lawler announced Perfect as his replacement on &quot;Superstars&quot;, his second stint as a color commentator on the show with Vince McMahon, this time with Jim Ross added as the analyst. Later in 1996, McMahon left and Ross switched to the play-by-play role. Perfect also did color commentary at Royal Rumble, SummerSlam and In Your House 10: Mind Games pay-per-views. Perfect also served as the special guest referee for the WWF Championship match between Shawn Michaels and British Bulldog at June&#x27;s King of the Ring pay-per-view.

In mid-1996, Hennig was placed in an angle with Hunter Hearst Helmsley, where he would come out to the ringside during Helmsley&#x27;s matches and steal his female escorts, which would often cause a distraction for Helmsley and affect his performance in matches. During the rivalry, Perfect helped Marc Mero in winning the Intercontinental Championship from Faarooq and assisted him in retaining the title against Goldust at In Your House 11: Buried Alive. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Perfect was initially going to make his wrestling comeback on Helmsley, but was attacked by Helmsley backstage just moments before their match. It appeared Helmsley&#x27;s attack left Perfect injured and unable to compete. This all turned out to be a ruse for the purpose of suckering Mero into defending his title against Helmsley. With help from Perfect, Helmsley won the title from Mero. Perfect began to serve as a mentor to Helmsley and accompanied Helmsley to the ring. Perfect left the WWF once again shortly before Survivor Series, making his last televised appearance on November 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1997–2000) ===
==== The Four Horsemen; New World Order (1997–1999) ====

Hennig signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in mid-1997. Since his Mr. Perfect ring name was trademarked by the WWF, he returned to competing under his real name. He debuted in WCW as a fan favorite on the June 30 episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;, during a brawl which erupted after the main event. His first match in the company took place at July&#x27;s Bash at the Beach pay-per-view where he became Diamond Dallas Page&#x27;s mystery tag team partner against nWo members Randy Savage and Scott Hall. Hennig ended up turning on Page costing them the match. As a result, Hennig began a rivalry with Page, defeating him in a match at Road Wild. Hennig continued to use the fisherman suplex as his finishing move, renaming it &quot;Hennig-Plex&quot;. Shortly after his debut, he became a top favorite of both Four Horsemen and the New World Order (nWo) as both factions showed interest in recruiting him. He ultimately joined the Four Horsemen, taking the spot of the retiring Arn Anderson. Hennig replied to Anderson&#x27;s invitation by saying &quot;It would be a privilege.&quot; Anderson&#x27;s plea that Hennig takes &quot;his spot&quot; was the subject of the following week&#x27;s parody of the Horsemen by the nWo, which led to the WarGames match. At Fall Brawl, Hennig was allegedly jumped backstage by the nWo before the WarGames match and came to ringside mid-match with his arm in a sling. The whole thing turned out to be a setup as Hennig betrayed the Horsemen and joined the nWo, handcuffing the other Horsemen to the cage and then slamming the steel cage door into Ric Flair&#x27;s head, afterward claiming he had &quot;destroyed the Horseman&quot; and as a further slap to Flair, claimed to be &quot;the wrestler that made Minnesota famous&quot;, thus becoming a villain. The following night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hennig won the United States Heavyweight Championship by defeating Horseman Steve McMichael. Hennig held the title for the next three months, during which he successfully defended the title against Flair in a standard wrestling match at Halloween Havoc and a no disqualification match at World War 3, before dropping the title to Diamond Dallas Page at Starrcade.

In the fall of 1997, Hennig was joined by his childhood best friend Rick Rude in the nWo. In 1998, Hennig and Rude were put into a rivalry with Bret Hart and his relatives British Bulldog and Jim Neidhart, during which both teams competed against each other in several matches throughout the first half of 1998. Hennig lost to Hart at Uncensored and defeated Bulldog at Spring Stampede.

He was sidelined due to a knee injury in mid-1998. During this time, the nWo broke into two different factions, the nWo Wolfpac and nWo Hollywood, both Hennig and Rude joined Kevin Nash&#x27;s fan-favorite Wolfpac group. However, the two villains did not really fit in with the fan-favorite Wolfpac faction, especially when Rude would still get on the microphone and tell the fans to shut up. Hennig was scheduled to wrestle Goldberg for the United States Heavyweight Championship at June&#x27;s The Great American Bash pay-per-view, but he failed to compete due to injury, so he asked Konnan to replace him. Konnan lost the match, and afterward both Hennig and Rude attacked him, removing themselves from the Wolfpac and joining nWo Hollywood. The following month, Goldberg won the World Heavyweight Championship and Hennig, despite his injury, faced Goldberg for the title in a losing effort at Bash at the Beach.

In the fall of 1998, Hennig began feuding with Horseman Dean Malenko over his betrayal of the Four Horsemen the previous year, which resulted in a match between the pair at September&#x27;s Fall Brawl pay-per-view, which Hennig lost. After the loss, Hennig was taken off television to recover from his knee injury. He returned to WCW at the Starrcade event in December to aid Eric Bischoff in defeating Ric Flair. Hennig joined forces with Barry Windham to take on Flair and his son David in a tag team match at Souled Out in 1999, which Hennig&#x27;s team lost. In 1999, both nWo factions reunited and Hennig was placed in the nWo B-Team, a group consisting of mid-card wrestlers of the nWo. However, he was kicked out of the group after speaking against the leaders on the January 25 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;.

==== West Texas Rednecks and departure (1999–2000) ====

Hennig formed a tag team with Barry Windham and continued the rivalry with The Four Horsemen. Hennig and Windham were placed in a tournament for the vacated World Tag Team Championship, which they won by defeating Horsemen Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko at SuperBrawl IX. Hennig and Windham held the tag titles for a month, before losing to Benoit and Malenko in a lumberjack match, the following month at Uncensored, after Arn Anderson hit Hennig with a tire iron. Hennig competed against Hollywood Hogan in a losing effort the main event of the March 18 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot; after Horace saved Hogan from a &quot;Hennig-Plex&quot;. In May, Hennig formed a new faction called The West Texas Rednecks with Windham, Barry&#x27;s brother, Kendall Windham, and Bobby Duncum, Jr. The group members were presented as southern country musicians. They began feuding with rapper Master P&#x27;s No Limit Soldiers and recorded an infamous country song titled &quot;Rap is Crap.&quot; During the rivalry, Hennig and Duncum lost to Konnan and Rey Mysterio Jr. of the No Limit Soldiers in a tag team match on June 13 at The Great American Bash. Less than a month later, the Rednecks lost to the Soldiers once again in an elimination tag team match at Bash at the Beach on July 11. Rednecks were intended to be villains but the southern WCW fans cheered them instead of the Soldiers, resulting in the angle being dropped. The Rednecks made their final pay-per-view appearance at Road Wild on August 14, where Hennig, Barry and Duncum lost to The Revolution in a six-man tag team match.

After the Rednecks disbanded, Hennig began a storyline, in which he stated that he was following orders from &quot;the powers that be&quot; that if he lost any match by pinfall, he must retire. He participated in a tournament to crown the new World Heavyweight Champion, during which he defeated Disco Inferno in the first round but lost to Jeff Jarrett in the second round. He was forced to retire after losing a retirement match against Buff Bagwell at Mayhem. He was reinstated by the powers that be a month later, however, and joined forces with Creative Control, during which the trio defeated Harlem Heat and Midnight at Starrcade.

He remained on the WCW television, continuing to make sporadic appearances with the company. He entered a feud with Shawn Stasiak in the spring of 2000, after Stasiak referred to himself as &quot;The Perfect One&quot; which was a ripoff of Hennig&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; character and even used entrance music composed to sound like Mr. Perfect&#x27;s theme song. Hennig lost to Stasiak at Slamboree. His last televised match in WCW was against Chris Harris on the May 20 episode of &quot;Worldwide&quot;, which Hennig won. Hennig left WCW after his contract expired in the summer of 2000.

=== Various promotions (2000–2001) ===
After leaving World Championship Wrestling, in summer 2000 Hennig appeared with the Australian i-Generation Superstars of Wrestling promotion, where he held the i-Generation World Heavyweight Championship on two occasions. Following his appearances in Australia, he began appearing with the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico, briefly winning the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship from Carly Colon. He appeared with the WWC until January 2001. In January 2001, Hennig made a one-night appearance in Japan with All-Japan Pro Wrestling at its King&#x27;s Road New Century 2001 event, taking part in a six-man tag team match in the Tokyo Dome.

In mid-2001, Hennig made a handful of appearances with Harley Race&#x27;s World League Wrestling promotion. He then wrestled sporadically on the independent circuit until November 2001, when he joined the newly-formed Xcitement Wrestling Federation. He wrestled for the XWF for the remainder of the year, facing opponents including Buff Bagwell and Vampiro. In December 2001, he made two further appearances with the World Wrestling Council.

=== Second return to WWF/E (2002) ===
During the buildup for January&#x27;s Royal Rumble, it was announced that Hennig would be returning as one of the 30 combatants in the match. Hennig, again billed as &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; (although his real name was widely acknowledged), entered the Royal Rumble at No. 25, and was one of the final three competitors before being eliminated by eventual winner Triple H. Perfect performed notably at the Rumble, hitting the Perfect-Plex on Kurt Angle and competing against several of the top WWF wrestlers of that period. His performance, along with the positive reaction of the Atlanta crowd, earned Hennig a full-time contract with the WWF. Perfect appeared the next night on &quot;Raw&quot; in a match with Val Venis. He then had matches with WWF&#x27;s up and coming Superstars like Brock Lesnar, Randy Orton, and Batista as well as having short feuds with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Rob Van Dam before forming a tag team with Shawn Stasiak at house shows throughout March and early April as well as a tag team on television with Big Boss Man. Perfect was drafted to Raw during the first ever WWF Draft. Perfect, now wrestling in the &quot;Raw&quot; brand, Faced the Big Show in a losing effort on April 8, 2002. In the April 21 edition of &quot;Heat&quot; he beat Stevie Richards and on the May 2 (Taped April 29) edition of &quot;Heat&quot;, Perfect faced Tommy Dreamer and won via pinfall. His final televised WWE match took place on May 12, 2002, where he was defeated by Matt Hardy. He also participated in a dark match at Insurrextion on May 4, 2002, defeating Goldust. Perfect was released from the WWE on May 8, 2002, due to a physical confrontation with Brock Lesnar on the return flight from the pay-per-view. Among other incidents of drunkenness, the tussle took place on the infamous &quot;Plane Ride from Hell&quot;. According to Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer on the &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot;, Hennig pranked Lesnar by slapping shaving cream on his head, which started the scuffle and almost opened the emergency exit door.

=== NWA Total Nonstop Action (2002–2003) ===
After being released from WWE, he went on to work for NWA Total Nonstop Action. In TNA, he would wrestle three matches for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship (two against Ron Killings and one against Jeff Jarrett), but didn&#x27;t win the title. Teaming with B.G. James, he also had a title match for the NWA World Tag Team Championship against Disciples of the New Church but failed to win the titles. Hennig wrestled his last match on January 8, 2003, defeating David Flair in an &quot;Axehandle on a Pole match&quot;.

== Personal life==
Hennig was married to Leonice Leonard. They had four children: Joseph, Amy, Kaite, and Hank. Joseph and Amy are professional wrestlers. In addition to his wife and four children, Hennig was survived by his parents, Larry and Irene; two brothers, Randy and Jesse; and two sisters, Sandra and Susan.

==Death==
On February 10, 2003, Hennig was found dead in a hotel room in Brandon, Florida at the age of 44, six weeks away from his 45th birthday. The Hillsborough County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office declared acute cocaine intoxication to be the cause of his death. It was stated by his father that steroids and painkillers also contributed to his death.

== Legacy ==
WWE aired a video tribute as well as words from friends and former co-workers Jerry Lawler and Jim Ross on Raw following the news of Hennig&#x27;s death. TNA paid tribute to Hennig by displaying his wrestling singlet and a framed photo as he was employed by TNA at the time of his death. A tribute song about Hennig, &quot;My Perfect Friend&quot;, was featured on the 2003 &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage album &quot;Be a Man&quot;.

Other peers including Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, and Kevin Nash have also commended Hennig&#x27;s in-ring talents. During his WWE Hall of Fame speech, Bret Hart spoke highly of Hennig, stating: &quot;Anytime I wrestled Curt was basically a night off&quot;, referring to Hennig&#x27;s ability to wrestle well and safely in the ring. Hennig&#x27;s widow, Leonice, signed a WWE Legends contract on her husband&#x27;s behalf.

Wade Boggs, who appeared in a vignette with Hennig and was a friend of his, inducted him into the WWE Hall of Fame on March 31, 2007. His wife, his four children, and his parents accepted the award on his behalf. On July 4, 2007, Hennig was posthumously inducted into the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in Waterloo, Iowa. His father, who was inducted the prior year, represented him at the event.

On September 9, 2008, WWE released a two-disc DVD set focused on Hennig titled &quot;The Life and Times of Mr. Perfect&quot;. Promotion for the video included Charlie Haas spoofing Hennig&#x27;s memorable sports vignettes at a Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s on &quot;Raw&quot;. Finding that he was incapable of performing those feats, Haas decided &quot;there was only one Mr. Perfect.&quot; The week after the DVD&#x27;s release, its first week possible, it went to number one on the Billboard Recreational Sports DVD sales list.

Hennig was mentioned on &quot;Raw 1000&quot; by his old friend Bret Hart, who acted as the guest ring announcer for the night&#x27;s Intercontinental title match. Hart stated that one of his best moments was winning his first ever Intercontinental title from Hennig, and described him as &quot;one of the greatest superstars who ever lived&quot;.

Hennig&#x27;s son Joe used the ring name Curtis Axel, representing his father&#x27;s first name and his grandfather&#x27;s nickname, respectively. He then went on to win the Intercontinental Championship in 2013 at Payback on Father&#x27;s day, and he dedicated his victory to his father. This title win makes them the first father-son duo to hold the championship the second being Rikishi and Jey Uso.

Hennig was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in Amsterdam, New York in 2015 by his son Joe.

<text>The Iolani Palace () was the royal residence of the rulers of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi beginning with Kamehameha III under the Kamehameha Dynasty (1845) and ending with Queen Liliʻuokalani (1893) under the Kalākaua Dynasty. It is located in the capitol district of downtown Honolulu in the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is now a National Historic Landmark listed on the National Register of Historic Places. After the monarchy was overthrown in 1893, the building was used as the capitol building for the Provisional Government, Republic, Territory, and State of Hawaii until 1969. The palace was restored and opened to the public as a museum in 1978. ʻIolani Palace is the only royal palace on US soil.

==Early history==
=== Pohukaina and the House of Kamehameha ===

In the early 19th century, the site of ʻIolani Palace was near an ancient burial site known as Pohukaina. It is believed to be the name of a chief (sometimes spelled Pahukaina) who according to legend chose a cave in Kanehoalani in the Koʻolau Range for his resting place. The land belonged to Kekauluohi, who later served as Kuhina Nui. She lived there with her husband Charles Kanaina. Kekūanaōʻa, a chief who served as Governor of Oʻahu, also had his home, called &quot;Haliimaile&quot;, just west of Kekauluohi&#x27;s home. Another chief, Keoni Ana, lived in Kīnaʻu Hale (which was later converted into the residence of the royal chamberlain), all members of the House of Kamehameha.

Kekāuluohi and Kanaʻina&#x27;s original home was similar to that of the other estates in the neighborhood consisting of small buildings used for different purposes. The sitting and sleeping area had a folding door entrance of green painted wood under glass upper panels. The house had two rooms separated by a festooned tent door of chintz fabric and was carpeted with hand crafted makaloa mats. In the front was a lounge area opposite a sideboard and mirror. In the middle they placed a semi circle of armchairs with a center table where the couple would write. Four matching cabinet-bookshelves with glass doors were set in each corner of the room with silk scarves hanging from each. In his book, &quot;A visit to the South Seas, in the U.S. Ship Vincennes: during the years 1829 and 1830&quot;, Charles Samuel Stewart describes the area and homes in detail.

Next to Kekāuluohi and Kanaʻina&#x27;s home was an old estate that had been demolished called &quot;Hanailoia&quot;. According to oral history, Hanailoia was the former site of a destroyed heiau called Kaʻahaimauli.

==== Tomb ====
Pohukaina was a sacred burial site for the aliʻi (ruling class). Years after 1825, the first Western-style royal tomb was constructed for the bodies of King Kamehameha II and his queen Kamāmalu. They were buried on August 23, 1825. The design was heavily influenced by the tombs at Westminster Abbey during Kamehameha II&#x27;s trip to London. The mausoleum was a small house made of coral blocks with a thatched roof. It had no windows, and it was the duty of two chiefs to guard the iron-locked koa door day and night. No one was allowed to enter the vault except for burials or Memorial Day, a Hawaiian holiday celebrated on December 30.

Over time, as more bodies were added, the small vault became crowded, so other chiefs and retainers were buried in unmarked graves nearby. In 1865 a selected eighteen coffins were removed to the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaiʻi, called Mauna ʻAla, in Nuʻuanu Valley. But many chiefs remain on the site including: Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku, Kalaniʻōpuʻu, Chiefess Kapiʻolani, and Haʻalilio. A lead coffin belonging to Kekupuohi (died 1836), one of the wives of Kamehameha I, was uncovered in 1931.

After being overgrown for many years, the Hawaiian Historical Society passed a resolution in 1930 requesting Governor Lawrence Judd to memorialize the site with the construction of a metal fence enclosure and a plaque.

According to tradition, Pohukaina was built on the site of a former cave.

=== Hale Aliʻi ===

In July 1844, Kekūanaōʻa began building a large home at the site of the current palace as a gift to his daughter Victoria Kamāmalu. Instead, Kamehameha III purchased the estate and used the home as his royal residence after moving the capital of the kingdom to Honolulu from Lāhainā. It would become the Iolani Palace. As older alii died, the lands were passed down and concentrated into fewer hands. Kekāuluohi&#x27;s lands were passed down to her from the Kamehameha family. When she died, she left her accumulated lands and wealth to her son, not her husband Kanaʻina however, Lunalilo predeceased his father.

The home built by Kekūanaōʻa was a wood and stone building called &quot;Hale Aliʻi&quot; meaning House of the Chiefs. It had only one-third the floor space of the present palace. Mataio Kekūanaōʻa, who was long-time Royal Governor of Oʻahu and husband of Kīnaʻu, the daughter of Kamehameha I, built the large home for his daughter Princess Victoria Kamāmalu who, from birth, was expected to rule in some capacity. It was purchased by King Kamehameha III from Kamāmalu (the King&#x27;s niece) when he moved his capital from Lahaina to Honolulu in 1845.

It was constructed as a traditional aliʻi residence with only ceremonial spaces, no sleeping rooms. It just had a throne room, a reception room, and a state dining room, with other houses around for sleeping and for retainers. Kamehameha III slept in a cooler grass hut around the palace. He called his home &quot;Hoʻihoʻikea&quot;, a separate building flanking the palace on the west side in honor of his restoration after the Paulet Affair of 1843. Kamehameha IV build a separate house on the east side of the palace called &quot;Ihikapukalani&quot; (on the mauka side) and &quot;Kauluhinano&quot; (on the makai side).

==== Name changed to ʻIolani Palace ====

During Kamehameha V&#x27;s reign Hale Aliʻi&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;ʻIolani Palace&quot;, after his brother Kamehameha IV&#x27;s given names (his full name was Alexander Liholiho Keawenui ʻIolani). It refers to the ʻIo (royal hawk). The Palace served as the official residence of the monarch during the reigns of Kamehameha III, Kamehameha IV, Kamehameha V, Lunalilo, and the first part of Kalākaua&#x27;s reign. The original structure was very simple in design and was more of a stately home than a palace, but at the time, it was the grandest house in town. The palace was largely meant for receiving foreign dignitaries and state functions with the monarch preferring to sleep in private homes.

===Seat of government===
Kamehameha I formed his official government at Lahaina, Maui in 1802, where he built the kingdom&#x27;s first royal residence called the Brick Palace. Lahaina remained the seat of government under the first three Kamehameha monarchs until 1845 when Kamehameha III moved the royal court. Lahaina had been the seat of government, where the royal courts of many chiefs of Maui had been located, including Kahekili II until 1794. In 1845 Kamehameha III moved the Royal Court and capitol to Honolulu. Hale Ali&#x27;i would become the seat of government and would remain so through the subsequent Kamehameha monarchs. After 1874, the main seat of government was transferred to the new central government building left by Kamehameha V. After the overthrow the provisional government would use the Iolani Palace as the seat of government. While a territory, the palace was called: The Capitol of the Territorial Government. It would also serve as the first state capitol building. The area was culturally significant as a seat of government for many reasons including the palace&#x27;s size, orientation and other factors of religious importance and bridged the ancient history of Hawaiʻi with the new 19th century monarchy.

==Kalākaua&#x27;s ʻIolani Palace==

By the time David Kalākaua assumed the throne, the original Iolani Palace was in poor condition, suffering from ground termite damage. He ordered the old palace to be razed.

Kalākaua was the first monarch to travel around the world and like Kamehameha V, he dreamed of a royal palace befitting the monarch of a modern state. While visiting Europe, Kalākaua took note of the customs and traditions practiced by his contemporaries where he decided that incorporating their elements would help legitimize his kingdom through their eyes; this included the building of a new palace inspired by these European grand palaces. Thus, he commissioned the construction of a new Iolani Palace, directly across the street from Aliiōlani Hale, to become the official palace of the Hawaiian monarchy.

===Design and construction===
Three architects, Thomas J. Baker, Charles J. Wall, and Isaac Moore, contributed to the design; of these, Baker designed the structure, while Wall and Moore offered other details. The cornerstone was laid December 31, 1879 during the administration of Minister of the Interior Samuel Gardner Wilder. It was built of brick with concrete facing. The building was completed in November 1882 and cost over $340,000 — a vast fortune at the time ($ in dollars ). It measures about by , and rises two stories over a raised basement to high. It has four corner towers and two in the center rising to . On February 12, 1883, a formal European-style coronation ceremony was held, even though Kalākaua had reigned for nine years. The coronation pavilion officially known as &quot;Keliiponi Hale&quot; was later moved to the southwest corner of the grounds and converted to a bandstand for the Royal Hawaiian Band.

Iolani Palace features architecture seen nowhere else in the world. This unique style is known as American Florentine. On the first floor a grand hall faces a staircase of &quot;koa&quot; wood. Ornamental plaster decorates the interior. The throne room (southeast corner), the blue meeting room, and the dining room adjoin the hall. The blue room included a large 1848 portrait of King Louis Philippe of France and a koa wood piano where Liliuokalani played her compositions for guests. Upstairs are the private library and bedrooms of the Hawaiian monarchs.

It served as the official residence of the Hawaiian monarch until the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. Therein not only Liliuokalani, but, Queen Kapiolani and other royal retainers were evicted from the palace after the overthrow.

The palace is the only official state residence of royalty on U.S. soil.

===Royal imprisonment and trial===
Upon the overthrow of the monarchy by the Committee of Safety in 1893, troops of the newly formed Provisional Government of Hawaii took control of Iolani Palace. After a few months government offices moved in and it was renamed the &quot;Executive Building&quot; for the Republic of Hawaii. Government officials carefully inventoried its contents and sold at public auctions whatever furniture or furnishings were not suitable for government operations. Queen Liliuokalani was imprisoned for nine months in a small room on the upper floor after the second of the Wilcox rebellions in 1895. The quilt she made is still there, in a room now called the Imprisonment Room or Quilt Room. The trial was held in the former throne room.
When a proposed annexation treaty up for ratification, the Hawaiian Patriotic League held a protest rally at the palace on September 6, 1897. They gathered petition signatures in an effort to demonstrate the treaty did not have popular support. On August 12, 1898, U.S. troops from the came ashore and raised the Flag of the United States at the palace to mark the annexation by the Newlands Resolution. The Queen and other Hawaiian nobles did not attend, staying at Washington Place instead. The building served as the capitol of the Territory of Hawaii, the military headquarters during World War II, and the State of Hawaii. During the government use of the palace, the second-floor royal bedroom became the governor&#x27;s office, while the legislature occupied the entire first floor. The representatives met in the former throne room and the senate in the former dining room.

When Liliuokalani died in 1917, territorial governor Lucius E. Pinkham accorded her the honor of a state funeral in the throne room of the palace.

===Archives===
After annexation, there was a fear that all records would be moved to the mainland. Since an 1847 effort by Robert Crichton Wyllie, a set of archives had been kept of all kingdom records. A new fireproof building was built in 1906 on the grounds just to the southeast of the palace. It included a vault by with steel shelves. At first it was to be called the Hall of Records, but the name Archives of Hawaiʻi made it clear the documents included those from the kingdom. A new Kekāuluohi building provides digital access to some of the collections.

== Palace restoration ==

In 1930 the interior of ʻIolani Palace was remodeled, and wood framing replaced by steel and reinforced concrete. The name ʻIolani Palace was officially restored in 1935.
During World War II, it served as the temporary headquarters for the military governor in charge of martial law in the Hawaiian Islands.

The Hawaiian soldiers of Japanese ancestry who were accepted for service in the U.S. Army became the core of the 442nd Infantry Regiment. Before leaving Hawaiʻi for training on the mainland, they were sworn in during a mass ceremony on the grounds of the Palace.

Through more than 70 years as a functional but neglected government building, the Palace fell into disrepair. After Hawaiʻi became a state, Governor John A. Burns began an effort to restore the palace in the 1960s. The first step was to move the former ʻIolani Barracks building from its original position northeast of the palace. It now serves as a visitors center for the palace.

ʻIolani Palace was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 29, 1962 and added as site 66000293 to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu on October 15, 1966. Government offices vacated the Palace in 1969 and moved to the newly constructed Hawaiʻi State Capitol building on the former barracks site. In preparation for restoration, the Junior League of Honolulu researched construction, furnishings, and palace lifestyle in nineteenth-century newspapers, photographs and archival manuscripts. Overseeing the restoration was The Friends of ʻIolani Palace, founded by Liliʻuokalani Kawānanakoa Morris, grand-niece of Queen Kapiʻolani. Two wooden additions were removed and the interior was restored based on original plans.

Through the efforts of acquisitions researchers and professional museum staff, and donations of individuals, many original Palace objects have been returned. Government grants and private donations funded reproduction of original fabrics and finishes to restore Palace rooms to their monarchy era appearance. ʻIolani Palace opened to the public in 1978 after structural restoration of the building was completed. In the basement is a photographic display of the Palace, orders and decorations given by the monarchs, and an exhibit outlining restoration efforts.

The grounds of ʻIolani Palace are managed by the Hawaiʻi State Department of Land and Natural Resources but the palace building itself is managed as a historical house museum by the Friends of ʻIolani Palace, a non-profit non-governmental organization. The birthdays of King Kalākaua (November 16) and Queen Kapiʻolani (December 28) are celebrated with ceremonies.

ʻIolani Palace is one of the only places in Hawaiʻi where the flag of Hawaiʻi can officially fly alone without the American flag; the other three places are Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau Heiau, the Mauna ʻAla and Thomas Square.

== Contemporary events ==
On January 17, 1993, a massive observation was held on the grounds of ʻIolani Palace to mark the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. A torchlight vigil was held at night, with the palace draped in black.

On April 30, 2008, ʻIolani Palace was overtaken by a group of native Hawaiians who called themselves the Hawaiian Kingdom Government to protest what they view as illegitimate rule by the United States. Mahealani Kahau, &quot;head of state&quot; of the group, said they do not recognize Hawaiʻi as a U.S. state, but would keep the occupation of the palace peaceful. &quot;The Hawaiian Kingdom Government is here and it doesn&#x27;t plan to leave. This is a continuity of the Hawaiian Kingdom of 1892 to today,&quot; Kahau said. Friends of ʻIolani Palace released a statement stating: &quot;We respect the freedom of Hawaiian groups to hold an opinion on the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, we believe that blocking public access to Iolani Palace is wrong and certainly detrimental to our mission to share the Palace and its history with our residents, our &quot;keiki&quot; (children), and our visitors.&quot;

=== In popular culture ===
An exterior view of the Palace was frequently shown on the 1968 TV show &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, suggesting it hosted the offices of the fictional state police unit featured on the show. It was also later portrayed in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the headquarters of the Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney, including Jason McCabe, in the TV series &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot;.

A movie titled &quot;Princess Kaiulani&quot; about Princess Victoria Kaʻiulani Cleghorn was filmed at the palace in 2008.

<text>Trigger is a song by Swedish heavy metal band In Flames from their 2002 album &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot;. A standalone version of the song was released as an EP on 10 June 2003, including bonus tracks. The title song was used on the soundtrack for the 2003 film &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;.

==Track listing==


==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Trigger&quot; showed the band playing in a club and being constantly pestered and booed by the members of Soilwork, with interspersed footage of other incidents between the two bands. Soilwork&#x27;s video for &quot;Rejection Role&quot; showed the situation &quot;vice versa&quot;, Soilwork playing and In Flames as the bullies. The colour is also reversed in each video: blue for In Flames, red for Soilwork. Both videos also had the other band riding in a pickup truck to and from the club. While some believed the tension between the two bands to be real, in reality the groups are close friends and devised the idea of a dual-video concept as a joke.

==Personnel==
*Anders Fridén – vocals

<text>Janet Evelyn Fookes, Baroness Fookes, (born 21 February 1936) is a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, she is a life peer in the House of Lords. She was previously a member of the House of Commons from 1970 to 1997, representing the constituencies of Merton and Morden (1970–74) and Plymouth Drake (1974–97). She was a Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons from 1992 to 1997, and presently is a Deputy Speaker in the House of Lords.

==Biography==
Fookes was educated at Royal Holloway College, University of London. She worked as a teacher from 1958 to 1970. She served as a Councillor on Hastings Borough Council from 1960 to 1961, and 1963–70.

Fookes was elected a Member of Parliament (MP) representing Merton and Morden in 1970. When this constituency was abolished, she was elected MP for Plymouth Drake in 1974. Drake was never a safe seat, but Fookes managed to survive many strong challenges in each general election she fought, including winning by a majority of just 34 at the October 1974 general election. She served as one of three Deputy Speakers of the House of Commons from 1992 to 1997. She retired from the House of Commons in 1997, when the number of Plymouth seats fell from three to two, after 27 years as an MP: as she humorously put it, &quot;longer than a life sentence&quot;.

Fookes served on the Council of the RSPCA 1975–92, and was its chair from 1979 to 1981. She was also a member of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (1987–97). She is an Ambassador for unemployment charity, Tomorrow&#x27;s People Trust.

==Honours==
On 30 September 1997, she was made a Life Peer as Baroness Fookes, of Plymouth in the County of Devon.

She had previously been made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1989 New Year&#x27;s Honours, and became Deputy Lieutenant of East Sussex in 2001.

<doc id="469628" wikidata="Q2415880" url="?curid=469628" title="Surrey Quays">
<text>Surrey Quays is a largely residential area of Rotherhithe in south-east London, occupied until 1970 by the Surrey Commercial Docks. The precise boundaries of the area are somewhat amorphous, but it is generally considered to comprise the southern half of the Rotherhithe peninsula from Canada Water to South Dock; electorally, Surrey Docks is the eastern half of the peninsula. The area is served by Surrey Quays railway station on the Windrush line of the London Overground. &quot;Surrey&quot; Docks are so called because the borders of Surrey and Kent met in this area until 1889.

== History ==
After the closure of the docks, the area remained derelict for over a decade; much of the warehousing was demolished and over 90% of the docks filled in. The only surviving areas of open water were Greenland Dock, South Dock, part of Canada Dock (renamed Canada Water), remnants of Norway Dock and a basin renamed Surrey Water. 

In 1981, the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher established the London Docklands Development Corporation to redevelop the former dockyard areas of east London, including the Surrey Docks.

Surrey Quays shopping centre was opened in 1988 and Surrey Docks underground station was renamed &quot;Surrey Quays&quot;. A massive building programme took place in the area during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with 5,500 new homes being built; this ranged from individual detached housing to large apartment complexes, such as Baltic Quay. South Dock was converted into a marina – now the largest in London – and a sailing facility (named &quot;Surrey Docks Watersports Centre&quot;) was constructed on Greenland Dock. The northern part of Canada Water and the infilled Russia Dock became wildlife reserves. Leisure facilities and a number of light industrial plants were also built, notably a new printing works for Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the London Evening Standard and the Daily Mail. This site was the headquarters of &quot;Metro (British newspaper)&quot; from its launch in 1999 until 2006, when the newspaper&#x27;s production was relocated to Kensington, west London. A further phase of development at Canada Water began around 2005 and is still underway. The location of &quot;Canada Water Surrey Quays&quot; lends its name to local property developer &quot;CWSQ&quot;.

Since 2007, there have been campaigns to change the name of the railway station back to &quot;Surrey Docks&quot;.

==Transport==
The area is served by Surrey Quays railway station on the London Overground route. The nearest London Underground station is at Canada Water, on the Jubilee line.

Surrey Quays is served by Transport for London bus services 1, 47, 188, 199, 225, 381, C10 and P12; night buses N1, N199 and N381 also call here.

Greenland Dock Pier is the nearest place for boarding London River Services, operated by Thames Clippers.

<doc id="469630" wikidata="Q6291244" url="?curid=469630" title="Interdict">
<text>In Catholic canon law, an interdict () is an ecclesiastical censure, or ban that prohibits certain persons or groups from participating in particular rites, or that the rites and services of the church are prohibited in certain territories for a limited or extended time.

==Definition==
An interdict is a censure, or prohibition, excluding the faithful from participation in certain holy things, such as the Liturgy, the sacraments (excepting private administrations of those that are of necessity), and ecclesiastical burial, including all funeral services.

The prohibition varies in degree, according to the different kinds of interdicts. Interdicts are either local or personal. The former affect territories or sacred buildings; the latter directly affect persons. A general local interdict is one affecting a whole territory, district, town, etc., and this was the ordinary interdict of the Middle Ages; a particular local interdict is one affecting, for example, a particular church. A general personal interdict is one falling on a given body or group of people as a class, e.g. on a chapter, the clergy or people of a town, or a community; a particular personal interdict is one affecting certain individuals as such, for instance, a given bishop, a given cleric.

Interdict differs from excommunication, in that it does not cut one off from the communion of the faithful. It differs from suspension also in that the latter affects the faculties of clerics, while the interdict affects the access of the faithful to religious rites. While the clergy cannot exercise their functions towards those under interdict, or in interdicted places or buildings, their powers are not directly affected, as happens in case of suspension.

== 1917 Code of Canon Law ==

===Distinctions===
Only the Holy See was empowered to impose a general interdict on a diocese or State or a personal interdict on the people of a diocese or country, but bishops too could impose a general interdict on a parish or on the people of a parish or a particular interdict on a place (such as a church or oratory, an altar or a cemetery) or a person.

===Effects===

A local interdict forbade general public celebration of sacred rites. Exceptions were made for the dying, and local interdicts were almost entirely suspended on five feasts of the year: Christmas Day, Easter Sunday, Pentecost, Corpus Christi and the Assumption of Mary.

Those who were under personal interdict were forbidden to be at any religious rite except preaching of the word of God. While mere attendance by them did not require that they be expelled, those well-known to be under interdict were to be prevented from taking any active part.

==1983 Code of Canon Law==

An interdict today has the effect of forbidding the person concerned to celebrate or receive any of the sacraments, including the Eucharist, or to celebrate the sacramentals. One who is under interdict is also forbidden to take any ministerial part (e.g., as a reader if a layperson or as a deacon or priest if a clergyman) in the celebration of the Eucharist or of any other ceremony of public worship.

These are the only effects for those who have incurred a &quot;latae sententiae&quot; interdict, namely, one incurred automatically at the moment of committing the offence for which canon law imposes that penalty. For instance, a priest may not deny Holy Communion publicly to those who are under merely automatic interdict, even if he knows they have incurred this kind of penalty – unless the reason for the interdict is known publicly and is persistent, in which case (though not technically due to the interdict) the concerned people are to be denied Holy Communion by force of can. 915.

However, in the case of a &quot;ferendae sententiae&quot; interdict, one incurred only when imposed by a legitimate superior or by sentence of an ecclesiastical court, those affected are barred from Holy Communion (see canon 915), and if they violate the prohibition against taking a ministerial part in celebrating the Eucharist or some other ceremony of public worship, they are to be expelled or the sacred rite suspended, unless there is a grave reason to the contrary. In the same circumstances, local ordinaries and parish priests lose their right to assist validly at marriages.

An automatic (&quot;latae sententiae&quot;) interdict is incurred by anyone using physical violence against a bishop, a person who, not being an ordained priest, attempts to celebrate Mass, or who, though unable to give valid sacramental absolution, attempts to do so, or hears a sacramental Confession.
Automatic interdict is also incurred by anyone falsely accusing a priest of soliciting sexual favours in connection with Confession or attempting to marry while having a perpetual vow of chastity.
An interdict is also the censure that canon law says should be imposed on someone who, because of some act of ecclesiastical authority or ministry, publicly incites to hatred against the Holy See or the Ordinary, or who promotes or takes up office in an association that plots against the Church, or who commits the crime of simony.

==Notable local canonical interdicts==

=== Norway ===
*Pope Innocent III placed the Kingdom of Norway under interdict in October 1198. Although King Sverre forged letters to show the interdict had been lifted, he and his subjects technically remained under interdict until Sverre&#x27;s death in 1202.

=== England ===
*Pope Innocent III also placed the kingdom of England under an interdict for six years between March 1208 and July 1214, after King John refused to accept the pope&#x27;s appointee Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury.

=== Scotland ===
*Following the rejection by Robert the Bruce (crowned King of Scotland in 1306) of papal mediation between England and Scotland, Pope John XXII placed Scotland under interdict in 1317 or 1318 because of continuing Scots raids into England; in 1328 the same Pope lifted the interdict in the light of the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton.

=== Hungary ===
* The town of Buda was placed under interdict by papal legate Niccolò Boccasini in 1303, who was sent there to build support for Charles of Anjou, Pope Boniface VIII&#x27;s favoured candidate for the Hungarian Crown. The burghers of Buda retaliated by excommunicating the Pope and all his loyal bishops and priests.

=== Italy ===

* Rome itself was placed under interdict by Pope Adrian IV in 1155 a result of a rebellion led by the preacher, Arnold of Brescia. 
*Pope Gregory XI placed the city of Florence under interdict in March 1376 during the War of the Eight Saints. 
* Pope Sixtus IV decreed an interdict against the Republic of Florence in 1478 in response to the hanging of Bishop Francesco Salviati in response to his involvement in the Pazzi conspiracy.
* On 23 June 1482, Pope Sixtus IV decreed an interdict against the Republic of Venice, unless it abandoned within 15 days its siege of Ferrara. The Venetians managed to evade it by an appeal to a future council.
* On 27 April 1509, as he entered the War of the League of Cambrai, aiming to recover papal control of the Romagna, where Venice had seized several cities in 1503, Pope Julius II placed Venice under interdict until it accepted peace terms on 14 February 1510, when it was lifted.
* The Venetian Interdict of 1606–1607 is a better-known and more lengthy case. Pope Paul V placed the Republic of Venice under interdict in 1606 after the civil authorities jailed two priests.
*In 1909, the town of Adria in Italy was placed under interdict for 15 days after a local campaign against the move of a bishop.

=== Malta ===
Interdiction featured in 20th-century Maltese politics. Between 1930 and 1933, those who voted for the progressive Compact parties (Constitutional Party, Labour Party) were interdicted and refused burial in sacred grounds. Once again, between 8 April 1961 and 4 April 1969, the National Executive of the Malta Labour Party was interdicted and voting Labour became a mortal sin; the leadership of the Malta Labour Party, readers, advertisers and distributors of Party papers as well as its voters were interdicted by the local bishop. In both cases, the Nationalist Party won elections while its opponents were interdicted.

=== France ===
*Pope Innocent III put the whole Kingdom of France under interdict on 13 January 1200 to force Philip II of France to take his wife Ingeborg of Denmark back. After a reconciliation ceremony, the interdict was lifted on 12 September 1200.

===United States===
*In 1955, white parishioners had refused a black priest entry to a chapel about 20 miles from New Orleans. Archbishop Joseph Rummel placed that chapel under interdict.

==Notable personal canonical interdicts==

Bishop René Henry Gracida of Corpus Christi, Texas, interdicted a Roman Catholic politician in the late 20th century for supporting legal abortion; the unnamed individual died under interdict.

In June 2008, Raymond Leo Burke, in his capacity as the Archbishop of St. Louis, applied an interdict to a Sister of Charity, Louise Lears, judging her guilty of three grave canonical offenses against the Catholic Church&#x27;s faith and teachings. Lears, a pastoral worker and educator, had publicly stated her belief that all of the church&#x27;s ministries, including the priesthood, should be open to women. Lears received the interdict after attending an ordination ceremony, which the church does not recognize, of a woman to the priesthood at a Jewish synagogue by the WomenPriests movement.

<text>The Game Developers Conference (GDC) is an annual conference for video game developers. The event includes an expo, networking events, and awards shows like the Game Developers Choice Awards and Independent Games Festival, and a variety of tutorials, lectures, and roundtables by industry professionals on game-related topics covering programming, design, audio, production, business and management, and visual arts.

==History==

Originally called the Computer Game Developers Conference, the first conference was organized in April 1988 by Chris Crawford in his San Jose, California-area living room. About twenty-seven designers attended, including Don Daglow, Brenda Laurel, Brian Moriarty, Gordon Walton, Tim Brengle, Cliff Johnson, Dave Menconi, and Carol and Ivan Manley. The second conference, held that same year at a Holiday Inn at Milpitas, attracted about 125 developers. Early conference directors included Brenda Laurel, Tim Brengle, Sara Reeder, Dave Menconi, Jeff Johannigman, Stephen Friedman, Chris Crawford, and Stephanie Barrett. Later directors include John Powers, Nicky Robinson, Anne Westfall, Susan Lee-Merrow, and Ernest W. Adams. In the early years the conference changed venue each year to accommodate its increases in size. Attendance in this period grew from 525 to 2,387. By 1994 the CGDC could afford to sponsor the creation of the Computer Game Developers Association with Adams as its founding director. Miller Freeman, Inc. took on the running of the conference in 1996, nearly doubling attendance to 4,000 that year. In 2005, the GDC moved to the new Moscone Center West, in the heart of San Francisco&#x27;s SOMA district, and reported over 12,000 attendees. The GDC returned to San Jose in 2006, reporting over 12,500 attendees, and moved to San Francisco in 2007 – where the organizers expect it will stay for the foreseeable future. Attendance figures continued to rise in following years, with 18,000 attendees in the 2008 event. The 2009 Game Developers Conference was held in San Francisco, on March 23–27, 2009. The IGDA awarded 25 scholarships to send qualified students to attend the 2009 GDC.

Crawford continued to give the conference keynote address for the first several years of the conference, including one in the early 1990s where he punctuated a point about game tuning and player involvement by cracking a bullwhip perilously close to the front row of the audience. Crawford also founded &quot;The Journal of Computer Game Design&quot; in 1987 in parallel to beginning the GDC, and served as publisher and editor of the academic-style journal through 1996.

During the late 1990s, the conference expanded from its original strict focus on game design to include topics such as marketing and legal issues.

The CGDC changed its name to &quot;Game Developers Conference&quot; in 1999. The GDC has also hosted the Spotlight Awards from 1997 to 1999, the Independent Games Festival since 1999 and the Game Developers Choice Awards since 2001. The GDC is also used for the annual meeting of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA).

The Independent Games Festival (IGF) is the first and largest competition for independent games, and highlights the innovative achievements of developers ranging in size from individuals building PC titles to studio teams creating console downloadable titles. A pool of judges from the game industry selects the finalists and winners, and the individual creators are named as the recipients of the awards. The IGF is managed and developed by UBM TechWeb, the organizer of the GDC.

The Game Developers Choice Awards is the game industry&#x27;s only open, peer-based awards show. Any member of the IGDA may nominate games, and then the membership votes on the finalists. As with the IGF, the individual creators are named as the recipients of the awards. Specialty awards such as Lifetime Achievement and First Penguin are determined by the GDCA committee, and all are revealed at the Game Developers Choice Awards ceremony at the GDC. The IGF and the GDCA are presented back to back, in an awards show produced by UBM TechWeb, typically on the Wednesday of the GDC.

UBM TechWeb has added several other events to the GDC in recent years. At the GDC Expo, developers display the latest techniques useful in game development. &quot;GDC Mobile&quot;, first held in 2002, focuses on developing games for mobile phones. Starting in 2004, the GDC partnered with Game Connection to present Game Connection @ GDC, a live matchmaking service for developers and publishers, which in 2007 expanded to include Game Connection Services for outsourcing and other services. Starting in 2006, the GDC partnered with Video Games Live to feature their symphonic performance of videogame music as the closing night event. In addition, the GDC has hosted a number of conference-wide game experiments designed by GameLab. The 2017 GDC included a Board Game Design Day, featuring talks from developers and publishers of tabletop games on their design processes.

UBM TechWeb has also produced several spinoff events. For example, the first GDC Europe (GDCE) was featured at the European Computer Trade Show (ECTS) in London between August 31 and September 1, 2001. Other GDC-related events include the Serious Games Summit, first held in 2004 as a GDC tutorial, and spun off as a standalone event in 2005, focusing on developing games for practical purposes, such as education, corporate training, military, and health care applications; and the Hollywood and Games Summit in conjunction with The Hollywood Reporter first held in June 2006. Additional events include the Game Advertising Summit, the Game Outsourcing Summit, the Game Career Seminar, GDC Russia, the China Game Summit, GDC London, the London Games Summit, the London Game Career Fair, and many others. In late 2006, UBM TechWeb acquired The Game Initiative, and now produces the Austin Game Developers Conference.

The 2020 GDC notably was the first to be fully postponed from its planned March 2020 dates, as a result of several companies having pulled out due to fears from the COVID-19 pandemic. Organizers ran the 2020 GDC as a virtual conference and announced GDC Summer as the next live event to take place in August. While initially planning on a mixed in-person and virtual conference for the 2021 event, the organizers dropped the in-person portion in February 2021 due to continued concerns from COVID-19, maintaining the virtual events.

UBM TechWeb brought its flagship event to Shanghai in 2007, where GDC China was held annually until 2015.

GDC China hosted the annual Independent Games Festival China (IGF China) from 2009, calling for entries developed by independent game studios and individuals in the Asia-Pacific region. IGF China includes the Independent Games Summit, the Independent Games Festival Pavilion, and the Independent Games Festival Awards Ceremony.

==Recurring highlights==

=== Tutorials ===
About half of the time during the first two days of GDC are given over to tutorials, one- or two-day-long sessions on a given topic. Tutorials take the form of hands-on workshops and cover a variety of technical subjects such as game design, audio, topics in computer programming (such as physics, graphics programming or web technologies), production and business management.

===Summits===
A summit is a section of panels dedicated to a sub-segment of the game industry, also usually held on the first two days of the conference. Past and current summit topics include mobile games, independent games, game education (for students aspiring to join the industry), serious games, social games, artificial intelligence, and online games.

===Console Maker&#x27;s Keynotes===
Regularly, Sony Computer Entertainment, Microsoft and Nintendo deliver keynotes at the conference showcasing upcoming products and technologies. Next to the Electronic Entertainment Expo, GDC keynotes are one of the more significant sources of news about upcoming console hardware and platforms, but with a focus on the developer audience instead of the wider press. A number of games in development or upcoming releases are also showcased, but generally far fewer than at traditional gaming conventions.

===Developer&#x27;s Rant===
Since 2005, the &quot;rant&quot; panel has been one of the most popular sessions at the conference. Moderated by Eric Zimmerman and Jason Della Rocca, a selection of notable industry figures are invited to speak on industry-related subjects they are passionate about. According to Zimmerman, the idea of the panel &quot;is to really take those grumblings and mutterings and bring them out into the light, speak truth to power, cut through to the real s***, and talk about what is going on in our industry—what&#x27;s wrong and what we can do to change it.&quot; Many rants inspire controversy, discussion and a good deal of media coverage in industry press. Most rant sessions focus on a particular segment of the industry to draw their speakers from:

* 2005: &quot;Burning Down the House: Game Developers Rant&quot;
* 2006: &quot;Burn Baby, Burn: Game Developers Rant&quot;
* 2007: &quot;Burning Mad: Game Publishers Rant&quot;
* 2008: &quot;Pouring Gas on the Flames: Game Designers Rant&quot;
* 2009: &quot;Burned by Friendly Fire: Game Critics Rant&quot;
* 2010: &quot;Fired and Fired-Up: Jobless Developers Rant&quot;
* 2011: &quot;No Freaking Respect! Social Game Developers Rant Back&quot;
* 2012: &quot;Burn this MotherFather!: Game Dev Parents Rant&quot;
* 2013: &quot;Mad as Hell: Hothead Developers Rant Back&quot;
* 2014: &quot;Rant Apocalypse: The 10th Anniversary Mega Session&quot;

The Rant panel has inspired similarly structured sessions, with more specialized topics (e.g., &quot;Game Educators Rant&quot; during the Education Summit, or rants during the Indie Game Summit).

===Game Design Challenge===
Eric Zimmerman created the Game Design Challenge. &quot;The idea of the challenge, he said, was to give everyone a sense of the process behind game design, and to attempt to get everyone thinking about new kinds of games.&quot; No actual game needs to be built, just designed. The goal of the 2nd annual Game Design Challenge was to create a game based on Emily Dickinson. It was won by Will Wright who designed an Emily Dickinson personality simulator contained entirely on a USB flash drive. The personality would interact with the player by sending Instant Messages and email. The goal was to maintain a stable relationship and avoid the two extremes: romantic obsession with the player or suicidal depression. The first occurrence meant constant interruptions when using the computer. The latter occurrence allowed for the simulation to delete itself. The 3rd time, the task was to create a game worthy of a Nobel Prize. Harvey Smith won with his PeaceBomb game. It would utilize wireless devices to organize flash mobs to engage in random acts of charity. For the first 3 challenges, Eric Zimmerman has always ended the challenge by indicating that all the contestants&#x27; ideas could really be made into a game.

The goal of the 4th annual Game Design Challenge was to create a game which was a religion, or which could become one. It was won by Jason Rohrer who designed a one-player at a time multiplayer game named &quot;Chain World&quot; contained entirely on a USB flash drive.

=== Experimental Gameplay Workshop ===
The Experimental Gameplay Workshop is an influential 2-hour game presentation session held annually at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The event showcases experimental video games and game prototypes. The workshop was founded by Jonathan Blow, the developer behind the game Braid. As of 2021, it was headed by Robin Hunicke and Daniel Benmergui. The session generally showcases 20 titles from over 250 submissions each year. Keita Takahashi showcased his title Katamari Damacy before it was released in the US at the workshop in 2004. At lecture at the GDC in 2005, Keita credited the session for helping get the game released in the US. In a 2009 interview, he however expressed some criticism of the format, saying the games chosen felt gimick-y and the presentations being uninteresting.

=== Game Developers Choice Awards ===
Held at the main GDC event in the first part of the year, the presentation for the Game Developers Choice Awards (GDCA) is held. The GDCAs are available for any game made in the previous calendar year, nominated and voted on by members of the game development community.

=== Independent Games Festival ===

The Independent Games Festival (IGF) is an event held during the main GDC in the early part of the year, open to games from small independent studios and from students at universities. The IGF culminates with the presentation of several awards to games which have been nominated and voted on in the months prior, and which are given space at the IGF to showcase their game. These awards have cash prizes associated with them, ranging from to for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize. The ceremony is typically held as the lead-in to the GDCA award ceremony.

=== alt.ctrl.GDC ===
alt.ctrl.GDC is an exhibit taking place in the GDC Expo. Visitors can play games using alternative controllers and meet the developers behind the projects. One of these games win the alt.ctrl.GDC Award, which includes a $2,000 prize plus a special trophy, at the IGF ceremony during GDC, with judging taking place on-site.
