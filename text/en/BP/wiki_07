<text>The A11 is a major trunk road in England. It originally ran roughly north east from London to Norwich, Norfolk. It now consists of a short section in Inner London and a much longer section in Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Norfolk. The lengthy section between these was renumbered as a result of the opening of the M11 in the 1970s and then the A12 extension in 1999.

It also multiplexes/overlaps with the A14 on the Newmarket bypass.

==Route==
===City of London===
All this part has been declassified and is now a minor road. Thus the A11 now starts at Aldgate, just inside the eastern boundary of the City of London. The first stretch is Whitechapel High Street, east of the junction with Mansell Street. In a complex reworking of the roads since the days of the Aldgate gyratory system, it is two-way, but the east-bound section is part of the ring-road that retained a one-way system south of this junction, but the westbound section is for local access and motorists have to U-turn to avoid entering the congestion charging zone.

===Tower Hamlets===
East of Aldgate station, the A11 enters the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and the East End of London. It becomes Whitechapel High Street (containing Aldgate East Underground station), again part of the Aldgate one-way system. The A11 passes through Whitechapel, past Whitechapel station and the Royal London Hospital.

It becomes Mile End Road at the eastern end of Whitechapel Road, at Mile End Gate, the former toll gate for the turnpike. It passes Stepney Green Underground station, with Stepney to the south, and continues through Mile End, passing the Mile End Underground station. Next, as it continues through Bow, it becomes Bow Road, passing Bow Road Underground station and Bow Church DLR station.

There is a dual carriageway flyover over the Bow Interchange roundabout, a junction with the A12. However at the end of the flyover, as the road crosses into the London Borough of Newham, the A11 designation disappears and it instead becomes the A118. This renumbering followed the opening of the A12 extension in 1999, to make the former A11 seem a less important road and encourage traffic to use the new dual carriageway between there and Leytonstone.

===Cambridgeshire and Suffolk===
The road number A11 reappears at M11 Junction 9A on the border between Essex and Cambridgeshire, and it is now a trunk road. It roughly follows the route of a Roman road for the remainder of its length.

The A11 formerly went through Newmarket; that stretch is now the A1304. The Newmarket bypass, opened to traffic in July 1975, is a dual carriageway. The western end is the A11, but most of its length is a multiplex/overlap with the A14. The A11 re-appears north-east of Newmarket, and remained a dual carriageway. The road bypasses Barton Mills before entering Norfolk in the Thetford Forest, passing the 113-foot-tall () Elveden War Memorial. This section of the road opened as a dual carriageway on 12 December 2014. This completes the dualling of the trunk road between Norwich and London.

===Norfolk===
The upgrading of the final section of single carriageway &#x27;Thetford Straight&#x27; between Barton Mills and Thetford (opened December 2014) means the road is dual carriageway all the way to Norwich. The road continues northeast bypassing Thetford, Attleborough and Wymondham. The A11 originally ran through the centre of all three towns giving rise to congestion which frequently became the focus of delays on the route. It also passes the Snetterton Circuit motor racing venue. On entering Norwich, it becomes single carriageway again and is called Newmarket Road. It terminates at the St Stephens Street roundabout near the city centre.

Various sections of the A11 between the junction with the M11 in Cambridgeshire and Norwich have recently been upgraded to dual carriageway. The Roudham Heath to Attleborough section was dualled in 2003
and the Attleborough bypass was dualed in 2007.
The previously single carriageway road between Thetford and the Fiveways roundabout is now dual carriageway and opened in December 2014.

== Cycling ==

=== London ===

Cycleway 2 (C2) runs alongside the A11 between Aldgate and the A12 in Bow. One-way cycle tracks run along either side of the A11 through Whitechapel, Mile End, and Bow, carrying cyclists from the City to Stratford. The route runs unbroken; the route is signposted and marked using blue paint and cycle icons.

At Bow, where the A11 meets the A12, C2 leaves the main carriageway along slip roads, and cyclists may congregate at an Advanced Stop Line - in both directions - to cross the roundabout, rejoining the main carriageway on the other side of the roundabout. East of Bow, C2 runs along either side of the A118 to Stratford station, and cycle lanes are provided as far as Ilford.

=== Norwich ===
The Wymondham to Sprowston Pedalway runs along the A11/Newmarket Road. To the west, the Pedalway joins the A11 at Eaton. Westbound destinations include Cringleford, Hethersett, and Wymondham. Running northeast, the Pedalway is signposted along a shared-use path adjacent to the Newmarket-bound (westbound) carriageway. The route crosses the A140/Daniels Road and continues along Newmarket Road as a shared-use path. It leaves the A11 in a northerly direction at the junction with the A1056/Ipswich Road. The route runs through Norwich City Centre to Sprowston.

==Completed improvements==

===A11 Fiveways – Thetford Improvement===
Proposals to dual 14.8 km of the road between the Fiveways Roundabout at Barton Mills, bypassing Elveden to the North and joining the western end of the Thetford Bypass had been discussed for many years without any developments being made. Draft Orders together with an Environmental Statement were published in Autumn 2008. The Labour government&#x27;s Secretary of State for Transport announced the scheme would be brought forward by 18 months to 2010 with an open date of 2013 in November 2008 in response to the Financial crisis of 2007–2008. Supporters expressed concern in September 2010 that the scheme would be cancelled as part of the coalition government&#x27;s comprehensive spending review noting that the report from the public inquiry had not yet been signed off by the Department for Transport.

The Highways Agency has published an official map of the proposed scheme and a Google overlay map is also available. The original cost estimate was £30 million rising to £60 million in March 2007
and then to £113-£157 million by August 2008.

The project received strong support from local business groups and local government
and was expected to reduce journey times by 3 minutes off-peak and up to 25 minutes at peak times. Environmental campaign groups believed that in a time of economic downturn it would be better to invest in local public transport rather than on costly road schemes.
On 20 October 2010, the government approved the scheme, indicating that the works would continue.
The Elveden Bypass opened during Easter 2014 with one lane in use each way. The full dual carriageway between Barton Mills and Thetford was opened on 12 December 2014 by transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.

==Former sections==
===City of London===
Originally, the A11 started at the Bank of England in the City of London, next to Bank Underground station, and went eastwards along Cornhill and Leadenhall Street, past Aldgate Pump and along Aldgate. Hence leading to the current A11 starting point at Aldgate.

===Newham===
From Bow Interchange, A118 briefly becomes a dual carriageway as it crosses the valley of the River Lea. This dual carriageway section ends at Stratford town centre, and was a one-way system until 16 September 2018, the eastbound road of which, Great Eastern Road, passed Stratford station. The formerly westbound road is now two way, called Broadway and The Grove; the latter road runs north–south. The old A11 then becomes Leytonstone Road; Maryland railway station turns northwards on the corner where the name change occurs. Meanwhile, the A118 heads eastward along its route towards Ilford and Romford. The A112 also joins the one-way system, heading north–south.

===Waltham Forest===
North of Maryland, the old A11 crosses from the London Borough of Newham into the London Borough of Waltham Forest and becomes High Road Leytonstone, passing under the Gospel Oak to Barking line.

===Redbridge===
Once past the Green Man Interchange, the former A11 route enters the London Borough of Redbridge and briefly becomes a southern extension to the A113 before turning into the A1199 (a duplicate designation, given that there is another A1199 in Islington), and is called Hollybush Hill, Woodford Road and High Road Woodford Green. It crosses over the A406 at Gates Corner (named after a Ford car showroom, which was turned into residential flats in 2006), but since the A406 was widened when the M11 was constructed there are no slip roads for interchange and the old A11 passes over the top. It merges with the A104 Woodford New Road by the Statue of Winston Churchill and becomes the A104 High Road Woodford Green. North, the road was A11 until the M11 opened in the 1970s, triggering the downgrading of the A11 between Woodford and Stump Cross (see below). Just before leaving London for Essex, the A104 becomes Epping New Road.

===Essex, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire===
Shortly after entering Essex, the A11 enters Epping Forest, following the mainly straight course of the Epping New Road turnpike constructed during the second quarter of the nineteenth century, alongside the boundary between Waltham Abbey and Loughton. It then reaches the Wake Arms Roundabout and becomes the B1393. Just after leaving the forest, it crosses the M25 motorway (here lowered into a cut-and-cover tunnel), then continuing through Epping. The B1393 ends at junction 7 of the M11, and the route of the A11 goes along the A414 through the eastern suburbs of Harlow, having been rerouted slightly to the west at the end of the 1950s to avoid passing through Potter Street. The road then becomes the A1184 and goes through Sawbridgeworth: through the rest of the Essex stretch between Harlow and Stump Cross the road follows a more traditionally English course, characterised by bends of varying and sometimes uneven radii, with just one straight mile (1.6 km) (to the south of Littlebury) along the north Essex stretch.

At Thorley Wash, just south of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, the A1184 turns sharp left to become part of the Bishop&#x27;s Stortford bypass, but the route of the A11 becomes the B1383 and goes through Thorley Street, Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, Stansted Mountfitchet, and Quendon. It crosses the M11 and passes Audley End. The B1383 ends at 9A (Stump Cross), the end of a spur that comes off the M11 at Junction 9, near Great Chesterford. From there, the former A11 section aligns once more with the current A11.

<text>The A13 is a major road in England linking Central London with east London and south Essex. Its route is similar to that of the London, Tilbury and Southend line via Rainham, Grays, Tilbury, Stanford-Le-Hope &amp; Pitsea, and runs the entire length of the northern Thames Gateway area, terminating on the Thames Estuary at Shoeburyness. It is a trunk road between London and the Tilbury junction, a primary route between there and Sadlers Hall Farm near South Benfleet, and a non-primary route between there and Shoeburyness.

==Route==
===London===

The A13 used to start at Aldgate Pump; but now begins at the junction with the A11 at what used to be the Aldgate one way system in east London and heads eastwards through the boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Newham, Barking &amp; Dagenham and Havering before reaching the Greater London boundary.

====Commercial Road and East India Dock Road====
At the central London end, Commercial Road and East India Dock Road form one of two main arteries through the historic East End (the other being the A11 &quot;Whitechapel Road&quot;). The A13 route is a relatively recent addition to London&#x27;s radial network, having been built at the beginning of the 19th century to connect the City with the (then) newly expanding Docklands area. &quot;Commercial Road&quot; dates from 1802, while &quot;East India Dock Road&quot; was set out from 1806 to 1812. The first iron bridge across the River Lea was built in 1810. Today the route is still largely single carriageway, though notable is the junction with the A12 and A102 at the northern portal of the Blackwall Tunnel. This section of A13 is used by the important London Bus routes 15 (as far as Blackwall) and 115.

====East Ham &amp; Barking By-pass (Newham Way and Alfreds Way)====

However, just east of Blackwall, at the crossing of the River Lea, there is a TOTSO (turn-off to stay on) with the A1261 East India Dock Link Tunnel, and the road changes character dramatically, becoming a dual three-lane expressway. This grade-separated route continues all the way to the Greater London Boundary. Notable junctions include Canning Town, and the A406 junction near Beckton, as well as the single carriageway Lodge Avenue flyover near Barking, where the old A13 route (&quot;Ripple Road&quot;) merges with the new. Grade-separated in 2002–2004, the dual carriageway section through Newham is &quot;Newham Way&quot;, while through Barking it is &quot;Alfreds Way&quot;, both comprising the &quot;East Ham &amp; Barking Bypass&quot;, and originally dualled by the 1960s. This section is structurally sound and built to high standards, but was subject to a 40 mph (64 km/h) speed limit. Prior to grade-separation, the speed limit was 50 mph (80 km/h). Works involved inserting new underpasses at Prince Regent and Movers Lane, a new flyover at Beckton Alps, and expanding Canning Town flyover from two lanes either way to three. Also inserted was the free-flow link to the A1261 tunnel. London Bus route 173 is the only route to use the A13 here, between Beckton Alps and &quot;Ripple Road&quot;. However, the speed limit was increased back to 50 mph in 2011.

====Ripple Road and the Thames Gateway====
East of the Lodge Avenue junction near Barking, the route then takes over the much older &quot;Ripple Road&quot;, with its last at-grade junction at &quot;Renwick Road&quot;, while the all-new grade-separated section east of the Goresbrook Interchange at Dagenham is termed the &quot;Thames Gateway&quot;, completed in 1999. This is notable for the award-winning viaduct over Fords works, opening in late 1999, and the causeway over Rainham and Wennington Marshes, the latter structure causing some delay to the project due to necessary studies on its environmental impact, although this section opened first, in mid-1997. The contract also included the Wennington to M25 motorway section (see below). It has National Speed Limit from just east of Goresbrook Interchange. London Bus routes 173 and 287 are the only routes to use the A13 here, between &quot;Ripple Road&quot; and Goresbrook.

In 2005, Havering Council commissioned the &quot;Litmus Towers&quot; sculptures on the A13 junctions near Rainham which display local environmental data using large LED arrays.

===Essex===

====Wennington to Sadlers Hall Farm====

The &quot;Thames Gateway&quot; section of the A13 leaves London at Wennington on the border with Thurrock, still dual three lanes, intersecting with the M25 motorway at Junction 30, close to the Dartford Crossing and Lakeside Shopping Centre. The A13 here is a much older dual carriageway, dating mostly to the 1980s, including the four-lane flyover above the M25, left incomplete for over 15 years. The Wennington to M25 section opened in late 1998. The next junction, the turn-off for Lakeside (A126), has only west-facing slips, so there is no exit eastbound. It is then dual three lanes past the junction with the A1089, the road into Tilbury, and loses its Trunk Road status to the latter. The A13 finally drops down to two lanes each way at the nearby A128 junction. It is dual for another , bypassing Stanford-le-Hope and Basildon before it reaches the Sadlers Hall Farm (or Sadlers Farm) roundabout. Here the road meets the A130 and loses its dual and Primary Route status. The main route into Southend is now the A127 &quot;Southend Arterial Road&quot;, accessible via the A130.

====A13/A130 Sadlers Farm Junction====

Improvements to the A13/A130 Sadlers Farm Junction were first given government approval in July 2006 following a 2005 public consultation. The project involved by-passing the roundabout by creating a new full-depth cutting link road between the A13 and A130, building slip roads connecting traffic to the Sadlers Farm roundabout and widening the A13 to dual four lane carriageway to Pitsea and the A130 to dual three lane carriageway to the Rayleigh Spur roundabout. The scheme is part of the Thames Gateway transport infrastructure plans which gave it an estimated cost of £63 million in 2007 and timelines it for 2012. The scheme was opened in 2012.

====Benfleet to Shoeburyness====

The A13 continues east of Sadlers Farm as mostly single-carriageway through Thundersley, Hadleigh, Leigh-on-Sea and Westcliff, before reaching the seaside resort of Southend-on-Sea. This is the last major town on the route, but it continues eastwards, including brief dual sections (&quot;London Road&quot;, Hadleigh, &quot;Queensway&quot; round the town centre, with its roundabouts with the A127 and A1160 (another &quot;TOTSO&quot;), and &quot;Southchurch Boulevard&quot; in Southchurch), and on to Shoeburyness, on the estuary east of Southend proper. It turns to the south at Parsons Corner, and then as &quot;Ness Road&quot;, it terminates at an end-on junction with the B1016, also forming part of &quot;Ness Road&quot;.
==History==

=== Original route through Newham and Barking ===

East of the River Lea, through Newham and Barking, the original route followed the A124 &quot;Barking Road&quot; and then the A123 &quot;Ripple Road&quot;. The present A13 still uses much of the eastern end of &quot;Ripple Road&quot;. The route was replaced by the &quot;East Ham &amp; Barking Bypass&quot; first opened in 1928, which was given the number A118 before being redesignated. As with the route west of the River Lea, &quot;Barking Road&quot; is a relatively new route, being built .

=== Original route through Dagenham and Havering ===

&quot;Ripple Road&quot; leads to Dagenham. The eastern end of this as well as &quot;New Road&quot; heading towards Rainham, in Havering, and the Greater London border, were bypassed by the new-build &quot;Thames Gateway&quot; in 1999. The former route was redesignated A1306. The western end between Dagenham and Rainham is still dual, but a short section near Rainham was singled in recent years. Like &quot;Barking Road&quot; further west, the original section of &quot;New Road&quot; between Dagenham and Rainham dates from , and was dualled at roughly the same time as the &quot;East &amp; Ham and Barking Bypass&quot;. &quot;New Road&quot; east of Rainham is much newer, and dates from the 1920s. It is and was single all the way towards the border at Wennington, consequently suffering congestion, especially after Lakeside Shopping Centre opened in 1990.

=== Original route in Thurrock and Basildon ===

The eastern half of &quot;New Road&quot; originates from 1924, and continues past Wennington as the A1306 &quot;Arterial Road&quot;, completed in 1925, bypassing Purfleet (the project including that town&#x27;s now unclassified &quot;bypass&quot;). It subsequently intersects with the M25 and A282 at Junction 31, heads past Lakeside and then ends at the A1012 near Grays. The route continues as the unclassified Lodge Lane before the latter becomes part of the A1013. The A1013 continues as far as Stanford-le-Hope, where the old A13 route merges with new at the A1014 junction. The eastern end of the erstwhile single-carriageway bypass is now a farm access, but can be shadowed on foot, meeting the B1420 at a roundabout just south of the modern A13 (the actual original A13 (pre-1930s) followed &quot;London Road&quot; and &quot;Southend Road&quot; through Stanford and Corringham). East of there, the B1420 meets the A13 at the A176 junction at Thurrock/Essex border and then the B1464 &quot;London Road&quot; continues the route south of Basildon, before meeting the newer road and the A130 at Sadlers Farm. The section of the route between the M25 and Sadlers Farm was by-passed or dualled in several stages between the mid-1970s and early 1990s, with Wennington to M25 opening in 1998 (see above).

=== Original route in Southend ===

In Southend, the short dual carriageway &quot;Queensway&quot; bypasses the original route through the town centre, and while much of this is pedestrianised, it can be followed on foot. East of the town centre, &quot;Shoebury Road&quot; was bypassed by the single-carriageway &quot;Bournes Green Chase&quot;, just a few yards to the north, linking Southchurch with Shoeburyness. Finally, the terminus of the A13 has been truncated, the road formerly ending on Shoeburyness &quot;High Street&quot; at the railway station.

=== Proposed route near Southend ===

In the 1960s, a route along the lines of the A13 was planned to take traffic to a new airport located at Maplin Sands near Southend. Only preliminary planning was carried out for the road (which may have been designated a motorway) before the proposals for the airport were dropped in favour of expanding Stansted Airport).
The route would have followed a similar route to the current A13 through Barking and Dagenham to Rainham before heading north-east towards South Ockendon then east towards Basildon. It would have continued eastwards between Basildon and Stanford-le-Hope before passing north of Canvey Island and south of Hadleigh, Leigh-on-Sea. The last section of road would have been constructed in the Thames Estuary passing south of Southend-on-Sea and Shoeburyness to reach the proposed site of the airport.

==Management==

The section between Limehouse and Wennington is maintained by RMS (A13) Plc as part of a 30-year DBFO deal reached with the Highways Agency in 2000. It was RMS who undertook grade-separation of the &quot;East Ham &amp; Barking Bypass&quot; section in 2002–2004. RMS also maintain the A1203 Limehouse Link tunnel as well as the &quot;Aspen Way&quot; and East India Dock Link tunnel sections of the A1261 through Docklands. This latter route runs just south of the A13, is dual carriageway and nearly all grade-separated and acts as an alternative to &quot;East India Dock Road&quot; and much of &quot;Commercial Road&quot;.

Despite the DBFO, Transport for London (who took over responsibility for all trunk non-motorway routes in London from the Highways Agency in 2000) still have overall responsibility for the entire A13 section inside Greater London, while the Highways Agency have responsibility for the remaining Trunk Road section between Wennington and the A1089 junction near Tilbury. From there until Sadlers Hall Farm, the A13 is a primary route and is maintained by Essex County Council, as is the non-primary section through Castle Point, although the sections through Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock are managed by their respective unitary authorities.

==Cycleway 3==

Cycleway 3 (C3) runs along the A13 between Poplar and Barking.

To the east C3 joins the A13 at the junction with the A1020/Leamouth Road. C3 runs eastbound, crossing the Bow Creek and Barking Creek and passing through Canning Town and Beckton &quot;en route&quot;. To the west, C3 ends at Greatfields Park, Barking, at the junction with Movers Lane/River Road.

West from Canning Town, C3 crosses over the A1020/Leamouth Road, heading southbound along the pavement until a junction with Sorrel Lane, where it turns right. It is signposted from Sorrel Lane and runs unbroken to Tower Hill in the City and Lancaster Gate, Hyde Park.

For the entirety of its route, C3 runs adjacent to the westbound carriageway of the A13 (to the south of the road) as a two-way bike freeway. The route is segregated from other traffic, except at some junctions. It is signposted and marked by blue paint.

Between Greatfields Park and the Lodge Avenue Junction, the two-way, segregated bikeway continues along the southern edge of the A13. The route is part of National Cycle Route 13 (NCR 13), but not the TfL Cycleways network. NCR 13 leaves the A13 to the east of Lodge Avenue Junction, crossing the A13 and joining residential streets as it runs towards Rainham. The northern terminus of NCR 13 is in Fakenham, Norfolk.

==Future developments==

=== A13 Passenger Transport Corridor (Southend) ===
The scheme aims to improve public transport along the A13; it includes bus stop improvements, provision of real time information and bus prioritisation at signals as well as junction enhancements and road widening. The road widening is planned for a number of points on the Hatley Gardens and Kenneth Road stretch of the A13. Following a public consultation in March 2009, the scheme was approved.&quot;The people of Thurrock have been calling for this for more than a decade, now at last the money is in sight and we can start to get things moving.&quot; The original estimated cost of the scheme was given at £4 million in the 2001–2006 Local Transport Plan and increased to £4.9 million in the 2006–2011 update. &quot;The government is recognising that a further £80 million more is needed to actually build the scheme.&quot;

===London===

Grade-separation of &quot;Renwick Road&quot; traffic lights in Barking, the final at-grade junction between Canning Town and Sadlers Hall Farm, was due to be undertaken &quot;in time for the Olympics in 2012&quot;. The works may also involve replacement of the nearby Lodge Avenue Flyover (Ripple Road Flyover), but this is subject to available funding and development of Barking Riverside.

The junction with the A406 North Circular Road was built in 1987 and is incomplete. The long-awaited Thames Gateway Bridge is yet to get the go ahead, but if built it will start at a flyover above the A13, thereby linking the A406 with the road network south of the River Thames. As of 2008, the project in its original form was cancelled by newly elected mayor Boris Johnson.

===M25 Junction 30===

Improvements including widening are being made at J30 of the M25 motorway and at nearby Lakeside turn-off (A126), following a Route Management Strategy undertaken by the Highways Agency.
The work commenced in late 2014 and was scheduled to be completed in autumn 2016.

==A13 in popular culture==
The A13 has inspired at least two rock songs: Billy Bragg&#x27;s &quot;A13, Trunk Road to the sea&quot;, which is a localisation of Bobby Troup&#x27;s song about Route 66; The music video for the Underworld song &quot;Scribble&quot; also features the A13, with the distinctive fencing on the side of the road clearly visible during the video. There is also the spoken word track called &#x27;A13&#x27; featured on the album &quot;Without Judgement&quot; by Jah Wobble&#x27;s Invaders of the Heart, in which Wobble intones his deeper, satirical thoughts concerning the &quot;hopeless highway of Essex&quot; over the musical backing of the band. In 2004, British author Iain Sinclair published a psychogeographic road novel, titled &quot;Dining on Stones&quot;, which loosely follows the route of the A13 from East London to the Thames Estuary. Mike Newman published an account of attempting to walk the route of the A13 in &quot;Adverse Camber: An Incomplete walk to the seaside&quot; in 2018.

<text>The City of Hume is a local government area located within the metropolitan area of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It includes the outer north-western suburbs, including the major centres of Broadmeadows, Craigieburn and Sunbury, as well as a number of rural localities between 13 and 40 kilometres from the Melbourne city centre.

It has an area of 504 square kilometres, and in June 2018 it had a population of 224,394. The City was formed on 15 December 1994 after the amalgamation of most of the City of Broadmeadows, the Shire of Bulla and parts of the City of Keilor and City of Whittlesea.

The City was Australia&#x27;s first local government to introduce a Bill of Rights for its denizens in 2004, following the establishment of a Social Justice Charter in 2001. This Bill of Rights predates the State Government&#x27;s Charter of Rights and Responsibilities by three years, and is more sweeping in that it explicitly includes economic, social, and cultural rights.

==Council==

===Mayors (1997– current)===
===Current composition and election method===

Between 2012 and 2024, Hume was divided into three wards – Aitken, Jacksons Creek and Meadow Valley – which elected a total of 11 Councillors:
* Aitken Ward (4 Councillors)
* Jacksons Creek Ward (3 Councillors)
* Meadow Valley Ward (4 Councillors)

Council elections are counted using single transferable vote. Voting is compulsory for residents who are on the voters&#x27; roll for local council elections, but voters aged 70 years or over are not obliged to vote at local council elections. The Mayor is a serving councillor, chosen annually by councillors. Council elections occur every four years, and were most recently held in October 2020 and October 2024.

=== 2020–2024 ===
=== 2024-2028 ===
==Townships and localities==
The 2021 census, the city had a population of 243,901 up from 197,376 in the 2016 census

<text>The A22 is one of the two-digit major roads in the south east of England. Radial, it carries traffic from London to the Eastbourne area of the East Sussex coast, in which town it ends.

==History==
===Turnpikes===
For part of its route the A22 utilises the turnpikes opened in the 18th century:
* 1718: London to East Grinstead section opened as a turnpike
* 1720: above road extended through East Grinstead to &quot;Highgate&quot;, Forest Row, the entrance to Ashdown Forest
By 1820 the road ran for 34 miles (54 km) from Stones End Street, Borough, London to Wych Cross. 
===Extension to Westminster Bridge===
The road was extended north to Westminster Bridge which was later renamed the A23.

==Route==
The A22 diverges from the A23 south of London at &quot;Purley Cross Junction&quot; (south of Purley). It runs over the North Downs into Surrey, crossing the M25 London Orbital Motorway just north of Godstone. This section incorporates the Caterham bypass, which opened in 1939 as one of the earliest such roads in the country, including the Wapses Lodge roundabout at the northern end. It then travels along the route of an ancient Roman road.

To the south of the M25, the road briefly enters West Sussex at Felbridge, just to the north of East Grinstead, and the A264 between Crawley and Tunbridge Wells merges with the A22 for a short section. The A22 bypasses East Grinstead town centre, running along a disused railway cutting, part of a line which closed as a consequence of the Beeching Report, which cut large numbers of local rail services. Richard Beeching was a local resident, and as a result, some local residents wanted to call this section the &quot;Beeching Cut&quot;. Instead, it was named Beeching Way.

To the south of East Grinstead the A22 crosses into East Sussex, just north of Forest Row. Between Forest Row and Nutley the road crosses the ancient Ashdown Forest. The A22 is the only road through the forest not subject to 40 mph speed limits. The A275 branches south to Lewes at the Wych Cross junction. Both the A272 and the A26 cross the A22 between Nutley and Uckfield. The A26 merges with the A22 for the section round Uckfield. There are bypasses of East Hoathly and Hailsham. There is a junction with the A27, to the north of the end of the A22, in Eastbourne.

<doc id="467299" wikidata="Q465863" url="?curid=467299" title="Shabana Azmi">
<text>Shabana Azmi (born 18 September 1950) is an Indian actress of film, television and theatre. Her career in the Hindi film industry has spanned over 160 films, mostly within independent and neorealist parallel cinema, though her work extended to mainstream films as well as a number of international projects. One of India&#x27;s most acclaimed actresses, Azmi is known for her portrayals of distinctive, often unconventional female characters across several genres. She has won a record of five National Film Awards for Best Actress, in addition to five Filmfare Awards and several international accolades. The Government of India honoured her with the Padma Shri in 1998 and the Padma Bhushan in 2012.

The daughter of poet Kaifi Azmi and stage actress Shaukat Azmi, she is an alumna of Film and Television Institute of India of Pune. Azmi made her film debut in 1974 with &quot;Ankur&quot; and soon became one of the leading actresses of parallel cinema, then a new-wave movement of art films known for their serious content and realism and sometimes received government patronage. Several of her films have been cited as a form of progressivism and social reformism which offer a realistic portrayal of Indian society, its customs and traditions.

In addition to acting, Azmi is a social and women&#x27;s rights activist. She is married to poet and screenwriter Javed Akhtar. She is a Goodwill Ambassador of the United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA). In appreciation of Azmi&#x27;s life and works, the President of India gave her a nominated (unelected) membership of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament.

== Early life and background ==
Azmi was born into a family, in Hyderabad, India. Her parents are Kaifi Azmi (an Indian poet) and Shaukat Azmi (a veteran Indian People&#x27;s Theatre Association stage actress), both of whom were members of the Communist Party of India. Her brother, Baba Azmi, is a cinematographer, and her sister-in-law, Tanvi Azmi, is also an actress. Azmi was named at the age of eleven by Ali Sardar Jafri. Her parents used to call her Munni. Baba Azmi was named by Prof. Masood Siddiqui as Ahmer Azmi. Her parents had an active social life, and their home was always thriving with people and activities of the communist party. It was not unusual for her to wake up in the morning and find members of the communist party sleeping about, from a previous night&#x27;s communist social that ran late. Early in childhood, the environment in her home inculcated into her a respect for family ties, social and human values; and her parents always supported her to develop a passion for intellectual stimulation and growth.

Azmi attended Queen Mary School, Mumbai. She completed a graduate degree in Psychology from St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Mumbai, and followed it with a course in acting at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune. She explained the reason she decided to attend the film institute, saying: &quot;I had the privilege of watching Jaya Bhaduri in a (Diploma) film, &quot;Suman&quot;, and I was completely enchanted by her performance because it was unlike the other performances I had seen. I really marvelled at that and said, &#x27;My god, if by going to the Film Institute I can achieve that, that&#x27;s what I want to do.&#x27;&quot; Azmi eventually topped the list of successful candidates of 1972.

In 2025, she will be seen in Netflix series Dabba Cartel written by daughter-in-law, Shibani Dandekar and produced by son, Farhan Akhtar. 

== Career ==
Azmi graduated from the FTII in 1973 and signed on to Khwaja Ahmad Abbas&#x27; &quot;Faasla&quot; and began work on Kanti Lal Rathod&#x27;s &quot;Parinay&quot; as well. Her first release, however, was Shyam Benegal&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Ankur&quot; (1974). Belonging to the art-house genre of neo-realistic films, &quot;Ankur&quot; is based on a true story which occurred in Hyderabad. Azmi played Lakshmi, a married servant and villager who drifts into an affair with a college student who visits the countryside. Azmi was not the original choice for the film, and several leading actresses of that time refused to do it. The film went on to become a major critical success, and Azmi won her first National Film Award for Best Actress and her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her performance. Qurratulain Hyder wrote that Azmi lives her role and acts like a seasoned dramatic actress in her first film.

She went on to receive the National Film Award for Best Actress consecutively for three years from 1983 to 1985 for her roles in &quot;Arth&quot;, &quot;Khandhar&quot; and &quot;Paar&quot;. &quot;Godmother&quot; (1999) earned her a record-setting fifth National Film Award, taking her tally to five. Azmi&#x27;s acting has been characterised by a real-life depiction of the roles played by her. In &quot;Mandi&quot; (1983), she acted as a madam of a whorehouse. For this role, she put on weight and even chewed betel. Real-life portrayals continued in almost all her films. These included the role of a woman named Jamini resigned to her destiny in &quot;Khandhar&quot; and a typical urban Indian wife, mother and homemaker in &quot;Masoom&quot; (1983).

She mainly acted in experimental and parallel Indian cinema. Deepa Mehta&#x27;s &quot;Fire&quot; (1996) depicts her as a lonely woman, Radha, in love with her sister-in-law. The on-screen depiction of lesbianism (perhaps the first in Indian cinema) drew severe protests and threats from many social groups as well as by the Indian authorities. Her role as Radha brought her international recognition with the Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress at the 32nd Chicago Film Festival and Jury Award for Best Actress at Outfest, Los Angeles. She was the initial choice for Deepa Mehta&#x27;s &quot;Water&quot; (2005), which was planned to hit the floors in 2000. A few scenes were already shot. Azmi had to shave her head with Nandita Das to portray the character of Shakuntala. However, due to political reasons, the film was shelved and later shot in 2005 with Seema Biswas replacing Azmi.

Some of her notable films are Shyam Benegal&#x27;s &quot;Nishant&quot; (1975), &quot;Junoon&quot; (1978), &quot;Susman&quot; (1978), and &quot;Antarnaad&quot; (1992); Satyajit Ray&#x27;s &quot;Shatranj Ke Khilari (The Chess Players)&quot;; Mrinal Sen&#x27;s &quot;Khandhar&quot;, &quot;Genesis&quot;, &quot;Ek Din Achanak&quot;; Saeed Mirza&#x27;s &quot;Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai&quot;; Sai Paranjpye&#x27;s &quot;Sparsh&quot; and &quot;Disha&quot;; Gautam Ghose&#x27;s &quot;Paar&quot;; Aparna Sen&#x27;s &quot;Picnic&quot; and &quot;Sati&quot;; Mahesh Bhatt&#x27;s &quot;Arth&quot;; and Vinay Shukla&#x27;s &quot;Godmother&quot;. Her other films include the commercially successful Manmohan Desai&#x27;s &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; and &quot;Parvarish&quot; and Prakash Mehra&#x27;s &quot;Jwalamukhi&quot;. Azmi starred in Hollywood productions such as John Schlesinger&#x27;s &quot;Madame Sousatzka&quot; (1988) and Roland Joffe&#x27;s &quot;City of Joy&quot; (1992).

Azmi debuted on the small screen in a soap opera titled &quot;Anupama&quot;. She portrayed a modern Indian woman who, while endorsing traditional Indian ethos and values, negotiated more freedom for herself. She has participated in many stage plays: notable among them include M. S. Sathyu&#x27;s &quot;Safed Kundali&quot; (1980), based on &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot;; and Feroz Abbas Khan&#x27;s &quot;Tumhari Amrita&quot; with actor Farooq Sheikh, which ran for five years. She toured Singapore on an assignment with the Singapore Repertory Theatre Company, acting in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s adaptation of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, which was directed by Rey Buono. She toured the UK, Dubai and India with British production &quot;Happy Birthday Sunita&quot; by Theatre Company RIFCO Arts in 2014. Pointing out the differences in all these media, she once remarked that theatre was really the actor&#x27;s medium; the stage was the actor&#x27;s space; cinema was the director&#x27;s medium; and television was a writer&#x27;s medium.

== Personal life ==
Azmi was engaged to Benjamin Gilani in late 1970s, but the engagement was called off. Later, she had an affair and married Javed Akhtar, a lyricist, poet and scriptwriter in Hindi films, on 9 December 1984, making her a member of the Akhtar-Azmi film family. It was Javed Akhtar&#x27;s second marriage, the first being with another Hindi film scriptwriter, Honey Irani. However Azmi&#x27;s parents objected to her being involved with a married man with 2 children (Farhan Akhtar and Zoya Akhtar). Indian actresses Farah Naaz and Tabu are her nieces and Tanvi Azmi is her sister-in-law.

== Humanitarian and other work ==
Azmi has been a committed social activist, active in supporting child survival and fighting AIDS and injustice in real life. She has campaigned against ostracism of victims of AIDS. A small film clip issued by the Government of India depicts an HIV positive child cuddled in her arms and saying: &quot;She does not need your rejection, she needs your love&quot;. In a Bengali film named &quot;Meghla Akash&quot;, directed by Nargis Akter, she played the role of a physician treating AIDS patients. She has also given her voice to an HIV/AIDS education animated software tutorial created by the nonprofit organisation TeachAids.
She has participated in several plays and demonstrations denouncing communalism. In 1989, along with Swami Agnivesh and Asghar Ali Engineer, she undertook a four-day march for communal harmony from New Delhi to Meerut. Among the social groups whose causes she has advocated are slum dwellers, displaced Kashmiri Pandit migrants and victims of the earthquake at Latur (Maharashtra, India). The 1993 Mumbai riots appalled her and she emerged as a forceful critic of religious extremism. In 1995, she reflected on her life as an activist in an interview in Rungh. After the 11 September 2001 attacks, she opposed the advice of the grand mufti of Jama Masjid calling upon the Muslims of India to join the people of Afghanistan in their fight by retorting that the leader go there alone.

Since 1989, she has been a member of the National Integration Council headed by the Prime Minister of India; a member of National AIDS Commission (of India); and was nominated (in 1997) as a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian parliament. In 1998, the United Nations Population Fund appointed her as its Goodwill Ambassador for India.

In 2019 Indian general election, she actively campaigned for Kanhaiya Kumar who contested from Begusarai, Bihar on a Communist Party of India (CPI) ticket.

== Artistry and legacy ==
Azmi is regarded as one of the greatest actors of Indian cinema. &quot;Rediff.com&quot; placed her as the seventh-greatest Indian actress of all time. In 2022, she was placed in &quot;Outlook India&quot;″s 75 Best Bollywood Actresses list. Azmi was placed first in &quot;Rediff.com&quot;″s &quot;Best Bollywood Debut Ever&quot; list, for her film &quot;Ankur&quot;. In 2023, Rajeev Masand named Azmi as one of Hindi cinema&#x27;s best actresses of all time. &quot;Times of India&quot; placed her in its &quot;50 Beautiful Faces&quot; list.

&quot;Filmfare&quot; included Azmi&#x27;s performances in &quot;Mandi&quot; and &quot;Arth&quot; in its list of &quot;80 Iconic Performances&quot; of Bollywood, placed 37th and 27th respectively. For &quot;Mandi&quot;, it noted, &quot;Shabana is dramatic, she is quirky and she´s bang on. A natural, her carefully restrained performance makes you smile at her lament about professionalism and loyalty. Although she is supported by a sterling cast, this is a satire which is all hers. See her spirited performances in &quot;Morning Raga&quot;, &quot;Masoom&quot; and &quot;Ankur&quot; as well.&quot;

== Filmography ==

She has acted in more than one hundred Hindi films, both in the mainstream as well as in Parallel Cinema. Several of her films have received attention in the international arena and Scandinavian countries, including at the Norwegian Film Institute, the Smithsonian Institution and the American Film Institute. She has appeared in a number of foreign films, most of which have won international acclaim, including John Schlesinger&#x27;s &quot;Madame Sousatzka&quot;, Nicholas Klotz&#x27;s &quot;Bengali Night&quot;, Roland Joffe&#x27;s &quot;City of Joy&quot;, Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Immaculate Conception&quot;, Blake Edwards&#x27; &quot;Son of the Pink Panther&quot;, and Ismail Merchant&#x27;s &quot;In Custody&quot;.

<text>The A27 is a major road in England. It runs from its junction with the A36 at Whiteparish (near Salisbury) in the county of Wiltshire, follows the south coast of Hampshire and West Sussex, and terminates at Pevensey (near Eastbourne and Bexhill) in East Sussex.

It is the westernmost road in Zone 2 in the UK road numbering system.

Between Portsmouth and Lewes, it is one of the busiest trunk roads in the UK.

==History==
Historically, for longer distance movement along the south coast, the M25 in combination with the M2, M20, M23 / A23, A3 / A3(M) and M3 has provided an attractive alternative to the actual south coast route of A259, A27 and M27. In 2002 an offpeak journey between Margate and Southampton via the M25 took 2 hours 30 minutes, and via the coastal route using the A259, A27 and M27 took 3 hours 50 minutes. The reason the coastal route is so much slower than the M25 alternative is largely due to a series of bottlenecks on the A27. These include Chichester, Arundel, Worthing and Polegate.

The British government announced, in its 2013 spending review, that it would go ahead with improvements to the Chichester bypass. The Highways Agency said that the proposals would be subject to public consultation in July 2015. The preferred route would then be announced in September 2015 and the plan would be to start construction in February 2018 with a completion date of December 2019. However the timescales were then revised. There was a six-week public consultation period during Spring 2016. The proposed construction would then commence in March 2019 with a completion date of March 2021. After five options were published and two dropped the government cancelled the whole project on 28 February 2017, citing lack of support from local authorities as the main reason. Chichester Bypass is now scheduled to be included in &quot;RIS3&quot;.
A proposed scheme to bypass Lancing and Sompting (as well as other sections) was dropped in 1988.

A proposed scheme to bypass Arundel was dropped in 2003, although the junction at the end of the dual carriageway has been partly made into an underpass. However, the scheme was relaunched in Spring 2018 when Highways England announced their preferred route, choosing a &quot;a modified version of Option 5A&quot;. Although the document claims 48% of respondents support this option, there are worries that the new road may damage ancient woodland in the South Downs National Park. With protests about the western end destroying an ancient woodland, Highways England consulted further in October 2019 and in October 2020 announced a new preferred route that is long and avoids the South Downs National Park and ancient woodland entirely. Plans were deferred until 2025-2030, before being dropped in 2025.

At Worthing, where the possibility of a bypass has often been discussed since 1967, even getting as far as passing the inspector&#x27;s report at a public inquiry, the plan was dropped in 1996 following rising costs. Arundel and Worthing are both areas of known traffic congestion during times of peak usage. The proposed improvements for Worthing would have begun in 2025 and be completed by 2027, but the scheme has been dropped.

A bridge over the level crossing at Beddingham was completed on 22 August 2008. The original proposal called for a dual carriageway standard link with a bridge over the crossing. However, the actual project involved improving the original single carriageway road by providing two lanes westbound and one lane eastbound between the Southerham and Beddingham roundabouts.

Despite the limited improvements to the A27, it is still substantially quicker (usually more than an hour difference) to travel from Southampton to Margate via the M25 route compared to the coast route of A259, A27 and M27.

Because of all the delays along its route, according to West Sussex County Council, the A27 is the most unreliable all-purpose trunk road in England.
Further, it is widely considered by businesses on the coast to cost money and inhibit economic performance due to its unreliability and frequent congestion.

Highways England commissioned a report by &quot;Transport Focus&quot; to undertake road user priorities. The South Central route, that is largely the A27, was one of the lower rated routes with 50% of users experiencing problems. Out of a list of strategic routes across the whole of England only two were rated worse than the South Central route: the M25 to Solent route (61%) and the London Orbital and M23 to Gatwick (58%). Further Highways England identified the A27 between Lancing and the A24; between Arundel and the A284; between the A23 and Polegate; also around Chichester as being some of worst performing links in the country for safety issues. One accident victim was Actor Desmond Llewelyn, who portrayed Q in a large portion of the James Bond film series and was fatally injured in a car accident on the A27 in 1999, at Firle, on the A23 to Polegate section.

There are several sections of the A27 that fall inside the Highways Agency nationwide top 250 collision rankings:

* A27 between Shoreham-by-Sea and Southwick – ranking 123 
* A27/A23 junction Brighton – ranking 158 
* A27 near the junction with the A2025 near Lancing – ranking 158 
* A27 Chichester By-Pass east of the city – ranking 202

==Serious incidents==
===Shoreham Airshow crash===

At the Shoreham Airshow on 22 August 2015, a Hawker Hunter crashed into the A27 at Lancing, striking several vehicles and killing eleven people. The road was completely closed for eight days and did not fully reopen until 16 September 2015.

===Flooding===
In November 2022, during the outbreak of flooding, the road near Chichester, Emsworth and Havant was extensively covered with floodwater. 20 cars were trapped on this section of the road.

The road starts at its junction with the A36 at Whiteparish. It runs through Romsey, Chilworth, at which point it follows a Roman Road, Swaythling, West End and Bursledon. It then closely parallels the south coast and travels on via Fareham, Cosham, Havant, Chichester, Arundel, Worthing, Lancing, Shoreham-by-Sea, Hove, Brighton, Falmer, Lewes and Polegate where it then terminates at Pevensey in East Sussex.

A section of the A27 running from the eastern end of the M27 to the end of the road at Pevensey forms part of, what was known as, the &quot;South Coast Trunk Road&quot;. Much of the road has been improved to dual carriageway standard, with the westernmost section of the trunk portion even having as much as four lanes plus a hard shoulder in each direction, and on a motorway alignment with grade-separated junctions. This is perhaps a reflection that the M27 was once proposed to run as far as Chichester.

The road runs east from Portsmouth to Havant then on to the Warblington/ Emsworth exit. Beyond Warblington the dual carriageway east has no junctions in it until it reaches Chichester, where the by-pass has five roundabouts and one traffic signal controlled junction, that disrupt the mainline flow of the road. The Chichester by-pass is regularly subject to congestion and although a public inquiry has proposed improvements, those improvements are currently on hold.

East of Chichester the road largely retains a two-lane dual-carriageway standard. There are, however a couple of sections of single-carriageway; at Arundel and at Worthing. These are both areas of known traffic congestion during times of peak usage.

At the junction of the A27 and the A24, the A27 has a brief section where the road is designated &#x27;A27&#x27; and &#x27;A24&#x27; before continuing from the &#x27;Grove Lodge&#x27; roundabout where the road is named &quot;Upper Brighton Road&quot;.
After Worthing, the A27 passes Sompting on the Sompting Bypass before passing through Lancing where there are traffic lights and a roundabout which disrupt traffic flow. Just before the road crosses the River Adur near Shoreham via the &#x27;Shoreham flyover&#x27; (constructed 1968-70), there is a traffic light-controlled intersection close to Lancing College and the headquarters of Ricardo plc which was the scene of the multiple-fatality Shoreham Airshow crash in 2015. After the &#x27;flyover&#x27; over the Adur, the A27 then runs past the Holmbush interchange (Shoreham-by-Sea) and on through the Southwick Hill Tunnel, at that point entering the City of Brighton and Hove, traditionally (though no longer administratively) part of East Sussex.

Later, it passes Brighton — where it is known as the Brighton Bypass — and around the South Downs. The junction of the A23 and the A27 is often slow in the morning rush hour.

It then passes around Falmer with this section of road having three lanes in each direction but loses the third lane later. When Brighton and Hove Albion play at home this section can become congested due to its proximity to Falmer Stadium. The road passes into East Sussex proper just to the west of the Falmer junction.

Afterwards, it passes south of Lewes where it meets the A26 road to Newhaven.

Here, the road becomes a single carriageway standard and formerly crossed a level crossing until it was bypassed by a bridge which opened in 2008. The South Coast Multi-Modal Study (SoCoMMS) recommended a dual carriageway, but the Highways Agency built it to a cheaper single-carriageway standard. Plans are still proposed for upgrading this later.

The road afterwards reverts to a dual carriageway with access to the A22, which provides links to Eastbourne and Hailsham.

The road then once again becomes a single carriageway near Pevensey, where the road ends, and the South Coast Trunk Road transfers over to the A259; this coast road starts in Emsworth and shadows the route of the A27.

===Bexhill to Hastings link road===

Work on the contentious Bexhill to Hastings link road commenced in early 2013 and was completed in late 2015. The road provides a more direct link from the A27 to the A28 road via the A259 road.

==Proposed developments==
The National Highways Agency state on their website that the A27 is the only east–west trunk road south of the M25 and it serves a population of more than 750,000 people along the south coast. They also say that safety is a problem along the A27 with many accidents and incidents along its length. To improve its safety and serviceability they intend to make improvements to the road. This includes:
*Arundel Bypass (RIS3)Plans were originally deferred until 2025-2030, but have now been cancelled.
*Worthing &amp; Lancing ImprovementsImprovements to junctions in the urban areas of Worthing and Lancing to increase capacity and improve safety. Proposed improvements would have begun in 2025 and be completed by 2027, but have been cancelled by the government.
*Chichester Bypass (RIS3)The National Highways Agency intend to hold a comprehensive public engagement programme in 2023, where people will be encouraged to have their say.

<text>The City of Bayside is a local government area in Victoria, Australia. It is within the southern suburbs of Melbourne. It has an area of 36 square kilometres and in 2018 had a population of 105,718 people.

==History==

===City of Brighton===

In 1858, after receiving two petitions, the Government proclaimed the Municipality of Brighton. Brighton was proclaimed a borough in 1863, a town in 1887, and a city in 1919.

===City of Sandringham===

The Moorabbin Road District was created in 1862 and became the Shire of Moorabbin in 1871. In 1917, parts of the West and South ridings were severed to create the Borough of Sandringham and three years later parts of the South and Cheltenham ridings were severed to create the Borough of Mentone and Mordialloc. The two boroughs became the Town of Sandringham and the Town of Mentone and Mordialloc in 1919 and 1923 respectively and Sandringham the City of Sandringham in 1923.

===City of Moorabbin===

Created a road district on 16 May 1862 and later proclaimed a shire in January 1871. A portion of Moorabbin Shire severed and annexed to Brighton Town in 1912 and a portion severed in 1917. The Borough of Mentone and Mordialloc was established in 1920 and re-subdivided in 1929 and later proclaimed a city in 1934.

===City of Mordialloc===

Created as the Borough of Mentone and Mordialloc by severance from Moorabbin Shire in May 1920. Redefined as a portion of Moorabbin Shire being severed and annexed in 1921. Declared a town in April 1923 and its name changed to Town of Mordialloc in April 1923 and later gazetted a city on 5 May 1926.

===City of Bayside===
On 15 December 1994 a new municipality was created to form Bayside City Council which comprises the former City of Brighton, the former City of Sandringham and part of the former City of Mordialloc west of Charman Road and part of the City of Moorabbin between the railway and Charman Road. The original proposal for the LGA gave it the name &quot;City of Warrain&quot;, &quot;warrain&quot; being a Boon wurrung word for &quot;by the sea&quot;, but the City of Sandringham proposed that the name &quot;Bayside&quot; be used instead.

Bayside was rated eighth of 590 Australian Local Government Areas in the BankWest Quality of Life Index 2008.

<text>The City of Banyule is a local government area in Victoria, Australia in the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It was created under the Local Government Act 1989 and established in 1994 as an amalgamation of former councils. It has an area of and lies between 7 and 21 km from central Melbourne. In 1994 it had a population of 116,000. In June 2018 Banyule had a population of 130,237. The Yarra River runs along the City&#x27;s southern border while its western border is defined by Darebin Creek.

The City moved their main offices from Ivanhoe to Greensborough in 2017. A brand-new civic centre was constructed, including three-level offices to accommodate 320 council staff, community and function rooms.

==History==
The area was originally occupied by the Wurundjeri, Indigenous Australians of the Kulin nation, who spoke variations of the Woiwurrung language group.

The City was named after the Indigenous Australian term Banyule or &quot;Banyool&quot;, and was originally the name of a locality within the former City of Heidelberg before being adopted as the name of the new Council during the amalgamation of local government areas in Victoria. It was formed in December 1994 from the merger of the City of Heidelberg with parts of the Shires of Diamond Valley and Eltham.

The City also has some significant heritage within its boundaries. Significant buildings listed on the Victorian Heritage Register include:

*Charterisville (1840)
*Banyule (1846)
*Ravenswood (1891)
*Chadwick House (1904)
*Heidelberg Town Hall (1937)

There are a number of housing estates designed by leading early 20th Century architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin and by property developer Albert Victor (A.V.) Jennings, some of the most significant art deco buildings in Melbourne, and the world&#x27;s first Olympics athletes&#x27; village.

Banyule is the birthplace of the Heidelberg School of Art, which was formed when a group of artists, including Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, Frederick McCubbin, Walter Withers, Charles Conder and others moved to a shack on Mount Eagle (now known as Eaglemont) and began painting the landscape in a uniquely Australian way during the late 1880s.

===Former councils===

Former councils which formed part of Banyule council&#x27;s current jurisdiction prior to their amalgamation include:

* City of Heidelberg (all apart from the Bundoora Health precinct)
* Shire of Diamond Valley (all apart from the area north of Greensborough Highway, the Bundoora Health precinct and the eastern part of Eltham North)
* Shire of Eltham (suburbs of Montmorency and Lower Plenty only).

==Council==
The councillors of Banyule after the elections in October 2024 are:

<doc id="467312" wikidata="Q176762" url="?curid=467312" title="Hualālai">
<text>Hualālai (pronounced in Hawaiian) is an active volcano on the island of Hawaii in the Hawaiian Islands. It is the westernmost, third-youngest and the third-most active of the five volcanoes that form the island of Hawaii, following Kīlauea and the much larger Mauna Loa. Its peak stands above sea level. Hualālai is estimated to have risen above sea level about 300,000 years ago. Despite maintaining a very low level of activity since its last eruption in 1801, and being unusually inactive for the last 2,000 years, Hualālai is still considered active, and is expected to erupt again sometime in the next 100 years. The relative unpreparedness of the residents in the area caused by the lull in activity would worsen an eruption&#x27;s consequences.

The area near Hualālai has been inhabited for centuries by Hawaiian natives, dating back to before recorded history. The coast to its west in particular had several royal complexes. The volcano is also important ecologically, is home to many rare species and several nature reserves near the summit, and is a popular hiking attraction. Today the coast near Hualālai is dotted by vacation resorts, some built on historic flows, and a National Historical Park.

== Geology ==

=== Structural features ===

Hualālai stands at with a prominence of . It is the westernmost of the five major volcanoes that form the island of Hawaii. Being in the post-shield stage of development, Hualālai is overall much rougher in shape and structure than the more youthful Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Hualālai&#x27;s structure is denoted by three rift zones: a well-developed one approximately 50° to the northwest, a moderately developed one to the southeast, and a poorly developed one trending northward about east of the summit. Over 100 cinder and spatter cones are arranged along these rift zones. Hualālai has no summit caldera, although there is a collapse crater about across atop a small lava shield. Much of the southern slope (above the modern town of Kailua-Kona) consists of lava flows covered by a layer of volcanic ash from thick. Of the volcanoes on the island, it is the third-tallest, third-youngest, third-most active, and second-smallest, making up just 7% of the island.

A major subfeature of Hualālai is &quot;Puu Waawaa&quot;, Hawaiian for &quot;many-furrowed hill&quot;, a volcanic cone standing tall and measuring over in diameter. It extends for , and has a prominence of , north of the summit at . The cone is constructed of trachyte, a type of volcanic lava not found on other volcanoes on the island. Trachyte flows move more slowly than the typically &quot;runny&quot; Hawaiian lavas due to its high (over 62%) silica composition (typical basalt is only 50% silica). Geologists hypothesize that Puu Waawaa originally formed during a pumice eruption a little over 100,000 years ago, and has continued to build since then, with at least three distinct trachyte flows recognized. The eruptions, although partially covered by flows from Hualālai and Mauna Loa, have built a distinctive structure known as the Puu Anahulu ridge.

Hualālai&#x27;s westward-facing flank forms a large underwater slump known as the North Kona slump. An area of about , the slump consists of an intricate formation of beaches and scarps below the waterline. This area was explored more closely in a 2001 joint Japan-United States project to explore the volcano&#x27;s flanks, utilizing the remotely operated vehicle ROV &quot;Kaikō&quot;. Data collected showed that the lava flows there originated in shallow water deep, and that unlike similar slumps at other volcanoes, the slump at Hualālai formed gradually.

Hualālai is a known source for xenoliths, rock from the Earth&#x27;s mantle that have been brought up in lava flows. Many prehistoric deposits, as well as those from the 1801 event, contain xenoliths of large size and abundant quantity.

=== History ===
Lava attributed to a shield-stage Hualālai has been found just offshore of its northwest rift zone. Tholeiitic basalt, indicative of the submarine subphase of the volcano&#x27;s construction, has been found in wells driven into the volcano at a depth of . These lavas persisted until an estimated 130,000 years ago. Hualālai entered the post-shield stage, the stage it is now in, about 100,000 years ago. Pumice and trachyte eruptions at Puu Waawaa may be a sign of this change.

Geological mapping of Hualālai indicates that as much as 80% of its surface has been topped by lava flows during the last 5,000 years, entirely composed of shield alkalic basalt. More than half of this is under 3,000 years old, and about 12% is less than 1,000 years old. Between 1700 and 2016, eruptions originated from six vents; four of these lava flows poured into the sea to the west coast.

== Eruption history ==
Hualālai is the third most active volcano on the island of Hawaii, behind Kīlauea and Mauna Loa. Although the two larger volcanos have each erupted over 150 times in the last 1,000 years, Hualālai has done so only thrice. Activity seems to recur at the volcano every 200 to 300 years.

A recent calm period, with almost no earthquake or magmatic activity at Hualālai, has seen the growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on its flanks. The most recent major activity at the volcano was in 1929, when an intense earthquake swarm rocked it, most likely caused by magmatic action near its peak. Although it has been relatively placid in the recent past, Hualālai is still potentially active, and is expected to erupt again in the next 100 years.

=== Lava stratigraphy ===
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has divided the exposed lava flows and tephra erupted by Hualālai volcano during the last 112,000 years into 419 rock units of eight chronostratigraphic age groups. These are summarized in the table below:

=== 1800–1801 eruption ===
Hualālai last erupted in 1800–1801. This eruption produced very fluid alkalic basalt lava flows that entered the ocean off the western tip of Hawaii island. Although five vents were active at the time, only two produced flows that eventually reached the ocean. The total output volume of the flow is estimated at over . One volcanic vent, situated high on the slope, produced a large ʻaʻā flow, dubbed the &quot;Kaʻūpūlehu flow&quot;, that reached the ocean as two distinct lobes. On its way down, it overran a village and a valuable fishing pond. There is a local legend that after the failure of several offerings of animals and other items to the gods, the flow was finally stopped when Kamehameha I threw a lock of his own hair into the fire. The Ka&#x27;ūpūlehu flow is also known for the particularly large quantity of mafic and ultramafic xenoliths that came up with it.

The other major outflow from the event reached the sea south of Kiholo Bay, destroying the village of Kaʻūpūlehu. This 1801 flow, known as the Huehue flow, formed Keahole Point where Kona International Airport is now located, north of Kailua-Kona. The eruption at Hualālai is believed to have been concurrent with an eruption at the nearby Mauna Loa. It is theorized that in the near past, Hualālai has been active around the same time as both Mauna Loa and Kilauea, although precise dating is impossible.

=== Recent activity ===
A severe earthquake swarm shook the volcano in 1929, lasting about a month. This caused $100,000 worth of damage to the Kona district ($1.2 million as of 2010), and two earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.5 and 6.5 were felt as far away as Honolulu. This was probably caused by magma movement near the surface, but there was no surface activity or eruption.

The 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake, with epicenter just to the north in Kiholo Bay near Māhukona, caused much damage in the area.

=== Future monitoring ===

Hualālai is expected to erupt again in the near future, as a 200- to 300-year estimated pause in activity is coming to an end. This presents a distinct hazard to the communities around it; for example, in the event of an eruption similar to the 1801 event, Kailua-Kona, which is from the volcano&#x27;s summit, could be covered completely in a matter of hours. According to the USGS lava-flow hazard zones, on a scale of 1 to 9, all of Hualālai is listed as threat level 4. For comparison, almost all of Kīlauea and Mauna Loa is listed as threat levels 1 through 3. The volcano&#x27;s flanks do not pose a lower threat to the population than the area near the rift zones because the distance is short and the slopes are steep; lava poses as much of a threat as it does near its source. The 2018 U.S. Geological Survey National Volcanic Threat Assessment classified Hualālai as a high threat volcano, with an overall threat score of 109, and ranked it 23rd among United States volcanoes most likely to threaten lives and infrastructure.

Since 1971, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has maintained a seismic recording station east of Hualālai&#x27;s summit to monitor the volcano. During this time, not a single earthquake swarm or harmonic tremor, indicative of activity at the volcano, has occurred. Hualālai is also monitored by several other instruments, including one continuous GPS instrument and several instruments on the flanks of adjacent volcanoes. In addition, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory uses GPS to measure slight changes in tilt and slope of Hualālai, indicative of magmatic movement.

Although Hualālai does experience several magnitude-4 earthquakes per year, these are attributed to a deep source off the coast of the north-western rift zone and are not related to the movement of magma.

== Human history ==

Hualālai has been a home to native people since ancient times. Centuries ago, the Ahu A Umi Heiau was built on the dry plateau east of the mountain. The Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park lies on the shore west of Hualālai, over the site of an ancient Hawaiian settlement. Although it is called &quot;kekaha ʻaʻole wai&quot; (lands without water), the rugged volcanic terrain attracted much sea life, making it an appealing place to settle. There are two main attractions within the park: the Kaloko fishpond, an area of &quot;loko kuapa&quot; (rockwall fishponds) constructed of interlocking rocks across a natural embayment on the coast, and Honokōhau, a former extensive settlement on the south side of the park.

Kamakahonu, Holualoa Bay, and Keauhou Bay were favored retreats of Hawaiian royalty long before the westernization of Hawaii. It was here that Kamehameha I rested after his eight-year campaign to unite the Hawaiian isles. His death in 1819 triggered social chaos. Mokuaikaua Church, built for missionaries in 1837 of lava rock and crushed coral, still stands today. Hulihee Palace, where many of Hawaii&#x27;s last kings spent their time, has been maintained as a museum since 1927.

Today, the coast west of Hualālai is a popular location for vacation resorts, since the rain shadow of the mountain causes many sunny days. The first, Kona Village resort, was built in 1961. Since then the Four Seasons Resort and the Kūkio golf course and vacation home complex have also been built on the 1800 flow. Both the Kona Village Resort and the Four Seasons Resort were damaged by the tsunami generated by the 2011 Sendai earthquake. The Hawaii Belt Road traverses the western slopes with an upper route called the Mamalahoa Highway and lower route named for Queen Kaahumanu.

Much of the Kona coffee crop grows on Hualālai&#x27;s western slope near the town of Holualoa.
The family of early coffee merchant Henry Nicholas Greenwell owned a large ranch on the western side of the volcano. The road from Kailua-Kona up the slopes of Hualālai is named for Frank &quot;Palani&quot; Greenwell.
Hawaii Route 200 known as the Saddle Road, crosses the plateau north of Hualālai, where the Pohakuloa Training Area provides a remote training ground for the United States Army and United States Marine Corps.

== Ecology and environment ==

Although some of Hualālai is bare volcanic rock, most of it is covered by some form of vegetation. Bushes, ferns, and grass are common, and even a few ōhia lehua trees (&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot;) grow along the summit. Many of the collapse craters in particular have vegetation, and a few even have respectably-sized &quot;vertical forests&quot; inside, including several eucalyptus tree groves. The volcano is populated by many birds and animals; the coast in particular attracts many fish and sea-dependent animals, such as the green sea turtle (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) and the black-winged stilt (&quot;Himantopus himantopus&quot;). Hualālai averages of rainfall per year. The summit gets more rain than the coast and is typically obscured in heavy cloud cover and vog.

Several ecological reserves lie on the flanks of Hualālai. The Puu Waa Waa forest sanctuary was established in 1992 (along with the Laupahoehoe sister reserve on Mauna Kea) as a testbed for long term ecological research about Hawaiian moist forest and dry forest biomes, and lies within a mile of the volcano&#x27;s summit on its northwestern flank. Elevation differs from sea level near the coastal edge to near the summit. Median annual rainfall is about . Plentiful lava flows from the 19th century provide unique niches for vegetative and soil growth in the region. The southern section of the reserve, closest to the summit, has been split into a bird sanctuary.

The Honuaula forest reserve on the southwestern flank of the volcano at , preserves an extensive koa (&quot;Acacia koa&quot;) forest stand, with smaller Naio (&quot;Myoporum sandwicense&quot;) and Māmane (&quot;Sophora chrysophylla&quot;) trees and an undergrowth of Ākala (&quot;Rubus hawaiensis&quot;) and various ferns. The reserve measures and protects an ecosystem that has since been largely deforested in the surrounding area. The Wai Aha spring reserve on the lower slopes of the mountain is somewhat swampy and is home to the flowering evergreen ōhia (&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot;), the woody climber Ieie (&quot;Freycinetia arborea&quot;), and a dense undergrowth of Amau (&quot;Sadleria cyatheoides&quot;).

<text>Mount Katmai () is a large active stratovolcano (composite volcano) on the Alaska Peninsula in southern Alaska, located within Katmai National Park and Preserve. It is about in diameter with a central lake-filled caldera about in size, formed during the Novarupta eruption of 1912. The caldera rim reaches a maximum elevation of . In 1975 the surface of the crater lake was at an elevation of about , and the estimated elevation of the caldera floor is about . The mountain is located in Kodiak Island Borough, very close to its border with Lake and Peninsula Borough.
The volcano has caused ten known fatalities due to gas exposure.

==Geology==
Mount Katmai is one of five vents encircling the Novarupta volcano, source of the VEI 6 eruption and associated voluminous pyroclastic flows in 1912. 
Katmai consists chiefly of lava flows, pyroclastic rocks, and non-welded to agglutinated air fall. The Quaternary volcanic rocks at Katmai and adjacent cones are less than thick. Much of the volcano is mantled by snow and ice and several valley glaciers radiate out from the flanks.

Katmai volcano is built on the sedimentary rocks of the Naknek Formation of Late Jurassic age, which are exposed just west of the caldera rim at an elevation of about , as well as north and southeast of the crater. Sedimentary rocks have been reported at an elevation of over in the west wall of the caldera and near the bottom of the eastern wall near .

==Volcanic activity==
Little is known about the historical activity of Katmai volcano before the great 1912 eruption. Early United States Coast and Geodetic Survey maps suggest a pre-caldera summit elevation of about , and local villagers reported in 1898 that one of the volcanoes in the general area &quot;smoked&quot; occasionally.

Between June 6 and 9, 1912, the most spectacular Alaskan eruption in recorded history and the 20th century&#x27;s largest measured volcanic eruption formed a large summit caldera at Katmai volcano. The eruption happened at a vent about to the west of Mount Katmai (at the Novarupta Volcano). During over 60 hours, the volcano erupted an estimated of ash flows and tephra representing of magma volume. The eruption produced a cloud of suffocating gas and ash that blackened the sky.

The inhabitants of the town of Kodiak, with ash falling on them, were led to the United States Revenue Cutter Service revenue cutter where they sheltered and were cared for by the crew, remaining in the harbor because Captain Perry determined &quot;an attempt to leave here would be unwise&quot; because the eruption made navigation dangerous.

The withdrawal of magma beneath Katmai resulted in the collapse of the summit area, forming the caldera. Following the subsidence, a small dacitic lava dome known as Horseshoe Island was emplaced on the floor of the caldera; this is the only juvenile material erupted from Katmai caldera during the historical eruption. It was visible at the time of the expedition in 1916, but has since been submerged by the crater lake. Still, the eruption from Katmai had a VEI of 3, and possibly involved phreatic eruptions.
Following the eruption, thousands of fumaroles vented steam from the ash, creating the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes.

In 1919, geologists noted a lake covering a large part of the caldera floor. By 1923 the lake was gone and numerous fumaroles, mud pots, and a large mud geyser had replaced it. The lake has since refilled to a depth of over . Small glaciers have formed on a bench within the caldera beside the lake. Pumice still floats on Naknek Lake nearby.

<text>Roth is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Middle Franconia, Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the northeast and clockwise) the districts of Nürnberger Land, Neumarkt, Eichstätt, Weißenburg-Gunzenhausen, Ansbach and Fürth, and the cities of Schwabach and Nürnberg.

In medieval times the area was ruled by many lords. Brandenburg-Ansbach and Nuremberg owned possessions in the territory, and other parts were the property of clerical states. When these clerical states were dissolved in 1803, the territory fell to Bavaria.

The district was established in 1972 through the merger of the former districts of Roth, Schwabach and Hilpoltstein.

<text>Tivadar Puskás de Ditró (in older English technical literature: Theodore Puskás) (17 September 1844 – 16 March 1893) was a Hungarian inventor, telephone pioneer, and inventor of the telephone exchange. He was also the founder of Telefon Hírmondó.

==Biography==

The Puskás family from Ditró (today Harghita County of Romania), was part of the Transylvanian Hungarian nobility. Puskás studied law and later engineering sciences. After living in England and working for the Warnin Railway Construction Company he returned to Hungary. In 1873, on the occasion of the World Exhibition in Vienna, he founded the Puskás Travel Agency, the fourth-oldest in the world and the first travel agency in Central Europe. 
After this, Puskás moved to Colorado and became a gold miner. It was while he was in America that Puskás exposed the American &quot;energy machine&quot; inventor Keely as a fraud. 

Puskás was working on his idea for a telegraph exchange when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. This led him to take a fresh look at his work and he decided to get in touch with the American inventor Thomas Edison.

Puskás now began to concentrate on perfecting his scheme to build a telephone exchange. According to Edison, &quot;Tivadar Puskas was the first person to suggest the idea of a telephone exchange&quot;. The first experimental telephone exchange was based on the ideas of Puskás, and it was built by the Bell Telephone Company in Boston in 1877.

On March 11, 1878, Puskas demonstrated the first working Edison phonograph from the US (using tinfoil) to the French Academy of Sciences. It was generally successful although he was also accused of &quot;ventriloquism.&quot; He was responsible for having it manufactured (in limited quantities) by E. Hardy of Paris.

In 1879 Puskás set up a telephone exchange in Paris, where he looked after Thomas Edison&#x27;s European affairs for the next four years. In Paris he was greatly helped by his younger brother Ferenc Puskás (1848–1884), who later established the first telephone exchange in Pest.

In 1887 he introduced the multiplex switchboard, which was a revolutionary step in the further development of telephone exchanges.

In 1890, Puskás was granted a patent for a procedure for carrying out controlled explosions, which was the forerunner of modern techniques. He experimented with this technology when he was working on regulating the Lower Danube.

Puskás registered the patent of technology behind the telephone newspaper Telefon Hírmondó in 1892, in the Patent Office of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with the title &quot;A new method of organizing and fitting a telephone newspaper&quot;. The &quot;Telefon Hírmondó&quot; service started on 15 February 1893, with around 60 subscribers. This &quot;Telephone News Service&quot; that he introduced in Pest, which announced news and &quot;broadcast&quot; programmes and was in many ways the forerunner of the radio. According to a contemporary scientific journal, at most 50 people could listen to Edison&#x27;s telephone at the same time, if one more person was connected, none of the subscribers could hear anything. With Puskás&#x27;s apparatus, by contrast, half a million people could clearly hear the programme coming from the exchange. After Puskás&#x27;s death on 16 March 1893, his brother Albert Puskás sold the enterprise and the patent rights to István Popper. 

Tivadar Puskás did not win extensive public recognition during his lifetime. However, in 2008, the Hungarian National Bank issued a 1000 Forint commemorative coin in honor of Puskás and the 115th anniversary of the introduction of the &quot;Telefon Hírmondó&quot;.

<text>BMW&#x27;s motorcycle history began in 1921 when the company commenced manufacturing engines for other companies. BMW&#x27;s own motorcycles—sold under the BMW Motorrad brand—began in 1923 with the BMW R 32, which was powered by a flat-twin engine (also called a &quot;boxer-twin&quot; engine). Production of motorcycles with flat-twin engines continues to this day, however BMW has also produced many models with other types of engines.

==Motorcycle history==
===1921–1938===
At the end of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles demanded that BMW cease production of aircraft engines. To remain in business, the company began producing small industrial engines (along with farm equipment, household items and railway brakes). In 1920, BMW M2B15 flat-twin petrol engine was released. Despite being designed as a portable industrial engine, the M2B15 was also used by several motorcycle manufacturers, including for the 1920–1923 Victoria KR1 and the 1920–1922 Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFw) &quot;Helios&quot; motorcycles.

BMW merged with Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, and the BFw Helios became the starting point for the first BMW motorcycle. Released in 1923, the BMW R 32 used a flat-twin petrol engine, which was longitudinally-mounted to eliminate the cooling problems of the transversely mounted engine in the Helios. This engine with , resulting in a top speed of . At a time when many motorcycle manufacturers used total-loss oiling systems, the new BMW engine featured a recirculating wet sump oiling system with a drip feed to roller bearings; a design which BMW used until 1969. The R 32 also started the tradition of shaft drive, which was used on all BMW motorcycles until 1994.

The &quot;BMW R 37&quot;, produced from 1925 to 1926, was BMW&#x27;s first sporting model. It was based on the &quot;R 32&quot; and used an overhead valve engine producing .

The first single-cylinder BMW motorcycle was the 1925 &quot;BMW R 39&quot;, which was BMW&#x27;s smallest model and used a engine. It was not successful and was discontinued in 1927. The next single-cylinder motorcycle was the BMW R 2, which was released in 1931. It used a engine and could therefore be ridden in Germany without a motorcycle licence at that time. The lineage of single-cylinder motorcycles continued with the &quot;BMW R 4&quot; in 1932 and the &quot;BMW R 3&quot; in 1936.

The BMW R 12 and &quot;BMW R 17&quot;, both introduced in 1935, were the first production motorcycles with hydraulically damped telescopic forks.

In 1937, Ernst Henne recorded a top speed of on a &quot;BMW 500 Kompressor&quot; racing motorcycle, setting a world record that stood for 14 years.

The &quot;BMW R 71&quot; big flat-twin motorcycle was exceptional. It was the Icon of BMW, expensive to build and well engineered. Unfortunately only 2638 motorcycles could be built before production was disrupted due to the War. Original bikes are now rare and highly sought after. Around 500 are known to survive today. It was either licensed to the Soviet Union in 1938 or just copied there, resulting in the Dnepr M-72 (produced from 1942 to 1960) and IMZ-Ural (modernised version still in production) motorbikes .

=== 1939–1945 ===
During World War II, the German military needed as many vehicles as it could get of all types and many other German companies were asked to build motorcycles. The BMW R 75 performed particularly well in the harsh operating environment of North Africa, partly due to the protruding cylinders of the flat-twin engine providing more effective cooling than other configurations which overheated in the sun. Shaft drives also performed better than chain-drives which were damaged by desert grit. The &quot;R 75&quot; inspired similar models from U.S. manufacturers, such as the Indian 841 and Harley-Davidson XA.

===1945–1955===
In Soviet-controlled East Germany, BMW&#x27;s sole motorcycle plant in Eisenach recommenced production of R35 and R75 motorcycles soon after the war, for reparations. The factory continued to use the BMW name, causing two separate companies (one in Eisenach and the other in Munich, West Germany) to be using the BMW name between 1948 and 1952. The head office of BMW, based in Munich, had no control over the operations in East Germany. Eventually in 1952, after the Soviets ceded control of the plant to the East German Government, and following a trademark lawsuit, the East German company was renamed Eisenacher Motorenwerk (EMW). Instead of BMW&#x27;s blue-and-white roundel, EMW used a very similar red-and-white roundel as its logo.

In West Germany, many of BMWs facilities had been badly damaged during the war, including the Munich factory which was in ruins. Initially, the terms of Germany&#x27;s surrender forbade BMW from manufacturing motorcycles. In 1947, when BMW received permission to restart motorcycle production from US authorities in Bavaria, BMW had to start from scratch. There were no plans, blueprints, or schematic drawings because they were all in Eisenach. The first post-war BMW motorcycle in Western Germany, was the 1948 &quot;BMW R 24&quot;. The &quot;R 24&quot; was reverse-engineered from the pre-war &quot;BMW R 23&quot; motorcycle with several improvements and powered by a single-cylinder engine. It was the only postwar West German model without rear suspension. In 1949, BMW produced 9,200 units and by 1950 production surpassed 17,000 units.

Production of flat-twin models resumed in 1950 with the &quot;R 51/2&quot; model, which was followed by the BMW R 51/3 and &quot;BMW R 67&quot; twins in 1951, and the sporting BMW R 68 in 1952. Except for the &quot;R 68&quot;, all flat-twin models came with &quot;bell-bottom&quot; front fenders and front stands.
===1955–1969===

Motorcycle sales in Europe plummeted as the 1950s progressed, with three of BMW&#x27;s major German competitors going out of business in 1967. In 1954, BMW produced 30,000 motorcycles. By 1957, that number was less than 5,500.

In 1955, BMW began introducing a new range of motorcycles with Earles forks and enclosed drive shafts. These were the BMW R 50, the BMW R 60 and the sporting model BMW R 69 with . On June 8, 1959, John Penton rode a &quot;BMW R 69&quot; from New York to Los Angeles in 53 hours and 11 minutes, slashing over 24 hours from the previous record.

By the late 1950s, the overall BMW company was in financial trouble. The company narrowly avoided a merger with Daimler-Benz through the combination of financing from brothers Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt, increased success of the automobile division and the selling off its aircraft engine division. Changes in the motorcycle market saw BMW&#x27;s last shaft-driven single-cylinder model, the BMW R 27, end production in 1967. Also, most of BMW&#x27;s offerings were still designed to be used with sidecars. However, by the late 1960s, sidecars were no longer a consideration of most riders; people were interested in sportier motorcycles instead. The BMW R 50/2, R 60/2, and R 69 S were the last sidecar-capable BMWs, with the latter being the most powerful and desirable model.

In the United States, sales of motorcycles were strong through the 1950s, in contrast to drastically declining sales in Europe. Later, specific &quot;US&quot; models were sold in the United States for the 1968 and 1969 model years: the BMW R 50 US, R 60 US and the R 69 US. These models were sold with telescopic forks (alongside other BMW models which were sold with Earles forks) and without sidecar lugs.

=== 1969–1982 ===
The model range was entirely revamped in 1969 with the introduction of the BMW /5 range, consisting of the 500 cc &quot;BMW R 50/5&quot;, the 600 cc &quot;BMW R 60/5&quot; and the 750 cc &quot;BMW R 75/5&quot; models. The engines were a complete redesign, with the crankshaft bearings upgraded from roller bearings to shell-type journal bearings (the type used in modern car engines). The camshaft was now chain-driven and located underneath the crankshaft instead of at the top of the engine, in order to lower the centre of gravity. An electric starter was available for the first time, although the traditional gearbox-mounted kick starter was also retained. The styling of the first models included chrome-plated side panels and a restyled tank. In 1973, the rear swingarm was lengthened, which improved the handling and allowed a larger battery to be installed.

The introduction of the &quot;/5&quot; models coincided with production relocating from Munich to a new factory in Spandau, West Berlin. at a site earlier occupied by a Siemens aircraft engine factory.

The BMW /6 range replaced the &quot;/5&quot; models in 1974, with the engine being discontinued and a engine introduced. The &quot;/6&quot; model range consisted of the 600 cc &quot;BMW R 60/6&quot;, the 750 cc &quot;BMW R 75/6&quot;, the 900 cc &quot;BMW R 90/6&quot; and the sporting 900 cc BMW R 90 S. Other upgrades included a five-speed gearbox, brakes and the electrical system. In 1975, the kick starter was finally eliminated.

In 1976, the BMW /7 range replaced the &quot;/6&quot; models. The 800 cc &quot;BMW R 80/7&quot; model was introduced, and the 900 cc &quot;BMW R 90/6&quot; and &quot;BMW R 90S&quot; models were replaced by the 1,000 cc &quot;BMW R 100/7&quot;, &quot;BMW R 100S&quot; and &quot;BMW R 100RS&quot; models. The latter was a full-fairing design which produced and had a top speed of . Later variants of the 1,000 cc models included the &quot;BMW R 100T&quot; (&quot;Touring&quot;), the &quot;BMW R 100 RT&quot; and &quot;BMW R 100CS&quot; (&quot;Classic Sport&quot;).

The 1978 BMW R 45 and BMW R 65 were entry-level 450 cc and 650 cc models that replaced the &quot;BMW R 60/7&quot;. Later variants of the &quot;BMW R 65&quot; included the 1982 &quot;BMW R65 LS&quot;, the sporting &quot;BMW R 65 S&quot; and the 1987 dual-sport &quot;BMW R 65 GS&quot;.

=== 1983–1992 ===

The BMW K 100, introduced in 1983, marked a departure from BMW&#x27;s tradition of air-cooled flat-twin engines. It was powered by a water-cooled inline-four engine with a displacement of , which was also BMW&#x27;s first fuel-injected motorcycle engine. The frame was tubular steel and the rear suspension was a single-sided swingarm. 

In 1985, the BMW K 75 was added as the entry-level model. The &quot;K 75&quot; was powered by a 750 cc inline-three engine, which was BMW&#x27;s first engine to use a counterbalance shaft. In 1988, the &quot;K 100&quot; became the first motorcycle to have anti-lock brakes (ABS) and in 1989 the &quot;K 100 RS 4V&quot; model became the first BMW motorcycle to use an engine with four valves per cylinder.

The 1988 BMW K 1 sports tourer was BMW&#x27;s first full-fairing sport bike. It had an aerodynamic body which was designed to minimise drag at high speeds.

Production of flat-twin touring models continued with the BMW R 100 and BMW R 80 model ranges.

=== 1993–2003 ===
Beginning with the BMW R 1100 RS sports tourer in 1993, BMW began to transition from engines with air-cooled cylinder heads (&quot;airhead&quot; engines) to oil-cooled cylinder heads (&quot;oilhead&quot; engines). The &quot;BMW R 100 RS&quot; also used &quot;Telelever&quot; front suspension (where braking forces are transferred horizontally to minimize &quot;fork dive&quot;) and a stressed engine.

Also introduced in 1993 were the single-cylinder BMW F 650 models, which was based on the Aprilia Pegaso 650. The related BMW F650 CS began production in 2001.

The &quot;airhead&quot; BMW R 80 GS and R 100 GS models remained in production until 1997, before being replaced by the newer &quot;oilhead&quot; models such as the &quot;BMW R 850&quot; series, the 1994–1999 BMW R 1100 R standard motorcycle, the 1994–1999 BMW R 1100 GS dual-sport, the 1996–2001 BMW R 1100 RT tourer, the 1998–2005 BMW R 1100 S sports, and the 1999–2004 BMW R1150 GS dual-sport.

The K Series models, powered by a water-cooled inline-four engine, included the 1996–2004 BMW K 1200 RS sports tourer, the 1998–2009 &quot;BMW K 1200 LT&quot; luxury tourer, and the 2002–2005 BMW K 1200 GT sports tourer.

The BMW R 1200 C, produced from 1997 to 2004, was BMW Motorcycle&#x27;s only entry into the cruiser market. At the other end of the model lineup, the 2000–2002 BMW C1 was BMW&#x27;s first and only enclosed scooter model.
=== 2004–2014 ===
The revised K Series range of water-cooled inline-four cylinder models began in 2004 with the &quot;BMW K 1200 S&quot; a sport-tourer. The K1200S was primarily designed as a Super Sport motorcycle, albeit larger and heavier than the closest Japanese competitors. Other additions to the K Series range were the 2005 BMW K 1200 R naked bike and related 2007 &quot;BMW K 1200 R Sport&quot; semi-faired sport-tourer, and the 2006 BMW K 1200 GT sport-tourer. The engine capacity of the K Series was expanded to for the 2008 BMW K 1300 S sport-tourer, the 2009 BMW K 1300 GT sport-tourer and the 2009 BMW K 1300 R naked bike.

In 2011, two six-cylinder models were added to the K Series range- the BMW K 1600 GT and BMW K 1600 GTL, the former intended as a sport-tourer and the latter as a luxury-tourer.

The R Series range of flat-twin models was also updated in 2004, beginning with the BMW R 1200 GS dual-sport, which was powered by a new &quot;oilhead&quot; engine. This was followed by the 2005 BMW R 1200 ST sport-tourer, the 2005 BMW R 1200 RT tourer, the 2006 BMW R 1200 S sport-tourer, and the 2006 BMW R 1200 R naked bike. In 2014, the redesigned BMW R1200 RT used a water-cooled engine and a wet clutch.

The BMW HP2 Enduro dirt bike was introduced in 2005, based on the &quot;BMW R 1200 GS&quot;. In 2007, the HP2 Enduro was joined by the road-biased HP2 Megamoto fitted with smaller alloy wheels and street tyres.

As part of the F Series range update in 2006, the BMW F 800 S sports bike and BMW F 800 ST sport-touring models were introduced, both powered by a Rotax parallel-twin engine. The BMW F 650 GS and BMW F800 GS dual-sport bikes were added to the range in 2008, both using the same 798 cc engine, despite the different names and the F 700 GS replaced the 650 in 2012. In 2009, the BMW F 800 R naked bike was introduced and in 2013 the BMW F 800 GT replaced the &quot;BMW F 800 ST&quot; sport-touring. In 2009, the BMW G 650 GS replaced the &quot;BMW F 650 GS&quot;.

The BMW G650X series range was introduced in 2006, co-developed with Aprilia and powered by a Rotax single-cylinder engine. The range consisted of the &quot;BMW G650 Xchallenge&quot; dual-sport, the &quot;BMW G650 Xcountry&quot; dual-sport and the G650 Xmoto supermoto models. The &quot;BMW G 450 X&quot; hard-enduro model was produced from 2008 to 2010.

In 2007, BMW acquired Husqvarna Motorcycles, including its production facilities and staff, from Italian manufacturer MV Agusta. BMW&#x27;s ownership of Husqvarna ended in 2013, when the company was sold to Pierer Industrie AG.

The BMW S 1000 RR sport bike was released in 2009, to compete in the Superbike World Championship. It is powered by a transverse-four engine producing .

<text>Trident Volcano is an eroded volcanic complex on the Alaska Peninsula in Katmai National Park, Alaska. Up to 23 domes comprise the complex stratovolcano, with the greatest elevation of . The most recent major activity produced a dome in an amphitheater on the southwest flank of the southwest peak. Volcano Novarupta formed on its slopes in the largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century.

According to the United States Geological Survey, the descriptive name, Trident, was given by Robert Fiske Griggs of the National Geographic Society, in 1916, because there were three major peaks. The volcano has been known by several variants of the name. The feature was officially named Mount Trident by the United States Board on Geographic Names in 1928. The board assigned the current name in 1968.

==Historical volcanic activity==
There is no evidence of recent eruptive activity at the summit of Trident, nor have there been any reports of historical activity, except fumarolic activity on the east side. The earliest known activity was minor eruptions in 1913, 1949 and 1950. A satellite cone formed February 15, 1953 on the southwest flank of Trident following a major explosive eruption that sent ash to an altitude of over . A succession of blocky lava flows were erupted in 1954, 1957, 1958, 1959-1960 from the new vent. Ash eruptions, some to altitudes over , were associated with several of the lava eruptions. By 1960, the dome had grown nearly high and a sequence of viscous flows, up to thick and covering an area of about south of the volcano, had been extruded. Further explosions were reported in the early to late 1960s. Lava extrusion, accompanied by explosions, was also reported from 1966 to 1968 and 1974 to 1975. In 1983, steam and/or vapor continued to rise from the central vent area of the new cone as well as from numerous fumaroles on the near-vent portion of the blocky lava flows.

==Composition==
Trident lavas are andesitic to dacitic in composition. The dominant phenocrysts are zoned plagioclase, hypersthene, calcic clinopyroxene, titanomagnetite, and rimmed olivine. The five flows which erupted from the new vent during the period from 1953 to 1963 are olivine-bearing, two pyroxene, high-silica andesite.

<text>The City of Maribyrnong is a local government area within the metropolitan area of Melbourne, Australia. It comprises the inner western suburbs between 5 and 10 kilometres from Melbourne city centre. It was formed in 1994 from the merger of the City of Footscray and parts of the City of Sunshine. In June 2018, Maribyrnong had a population of 91,387.

According to Local Government Victoria, Maribyrnong has the second most ethnically diverse population in Victoria, with 40% of residents born outside Australia.

Many of Maribyrnong&#x27;s former industrial sites have been replaced by residential developments. New residents are generally more educated and higher income. Maribyrnong attracted new cultural groups. Its name comes from the nearby Maribyrnong River.

<doc id="467327" wikidata="Q917261" url="?curid=467327" title="City of Brimbank">
<text>The City of Brimbank is a local government area located within the metropolitan area of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It comprises the western suburbs between 10 and 20 km west and northwest from the Melbourne city centre.

The City has an area of 123 km2 and in June 2018, Brimbank had a population of 208,714.

==History==
The Wurundjeri people have been the custodians of the land in the Port Phillip Bay region, including the current City of Brimbank, for over 40,000 years before European settlement. Brimbank lies within the area occupied by the Kurung-Jang-Balluk and Marin-Balluk clans of the Wurundjeri people (also known as the Woiwurung language group) who form part of the larger Kulin Nation. Other groups who occupied land in the area include the Yalukit-Willam and Marpeang-Bulluk clans.

Brimbank was founded on 15 December 1994 during the amalgamations of local councils by the state government. It was formed after the merger of the former Cities of Keilor and Sunshine. It was named after Brimbank Park in Keilor, which itself was named for the practice of local farmers driving livestock &quot;around the brim of the bank&quot; of the Maribyrnong River.

The municipality has thirteen places listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

===Misconduct investigations and dismissal===
In 2008 and 2009, the Brimbank City Council was the subject of several investigations into alleged misconduct by councillors.

On 30 July 2008, the state MP for Keilor, George Seitz, invoked parliamentary privilege in the Legislative Assembly to accuse former Brimbank mayor Cr Natalie Suleyman of branch stacking, describing her as the &quot;Robert Mugabe of Brimbank&quot;. Seitz alleged that Suleyman had &#x27;retaliated&#x27; by directing Council to block funding for capital works projects after she was defeated in Labor Party preselection for the 2008 Kororoit state by-election. Following disclosures made under the &quot;Whistleblowers Protection Act 2001&quot;, the Victorian Ombudsman, George Brouwer, commenced an investigation into the Council in September.

Brouwer&#x27;s report was presented to Parliament on 7 May 2009, and found councillors were &quot;generally dysfunctional&quot;, &quot;lacked awareness of their role&quot;, and were &quot;influenced&quot; by unelected third parties. The report asserted that between 2005 and 2008, decisions were reached by a majority (or &#x27;ruling&#x27;) faction of councillors who would vote on decisions as a bloc. Of the 6 members of the &#x27;ruling faction&#x27;, only two were re-elected to council in 2008.

The report concluded that:
* External parties, including state MPs George Seitz and Theo Theophanous, and former federal MP Andrew Theophanous, had unduly influenced council business,
* The &#x27;ruling faction&#x27; &quot;did not exercise reasonable care&quot; in directing Brimbank CEO Marilyn Duncan to remove funding for the Keilor Lodge Reserve project,
* The &#x27;ruling faction&#x27; intended to &quot;worry&quot; Seitz by calling for expressions of interest on the Keilor Lodge Reserve site,
* Cr Suleyman acted &quot;with inappropriate partiality&quot; in prioritising works at Cairnlea Park in the Council&#x27;s 2008–09 budget,
* Cr Eriksson contravened the Council&#x27;s Code of Governance by releasing confidential information to the &quot;Sunshine Advocate&quot;, &quot;Brimbank Leader&quot; and &quot;Brimbank Star&quot; newspapers,
* The Labor Party had appeared to breach the &quot;Electoral Act&quot; by distributing prohibited material to Cr Capar,
* Councillors had misused council-owned laptops and BlackBerry devices,
* Council had failed to handle the severance package of outgoing CEO Marilyn Duncan &quot;in an open and transparent manner&quot;,
* The &#x27;ruling faction&#x27; had determined the election of mayor until 2013, and
* Local Government Victoria had failed to adequately deal with complaints from residents about Council decision-making.

In response to the Brouwer report, the Minister for Local Government, Richard Wynne, appointed William Scales to closely monitor the council over a three-month period. In his second report Scales found that, despite being closely monitored, there remained widespread misconduct amongst councillors, and recommended that councillors should be suspended or dismissed from their positions. David Walker, a former police detective, was also appointed to investigate possible breaches of the &quot;Local Government Act&quot;.

On 15 September, Wynne announced that Council would be dismissed, with administrators appointed until November 2012. On 17 November, the Victorian Government appointed Peter Lewinsky, Joanne Anderson and Meredith Sussex as administrators for a three-year period. Investigations into the conduct of Seitz, along with councillors Suleyman, Kathryn Eriksson and Troy Atanasovski, concluded in December with the Local Government Inspectorate informing those involved that it would take no further action.

In May 2012, the Victorian Government announced it would extend the tenure of administrators for a further three years, with Lewinsky reappointed alongside John Watson and former Brimbank commissioner Jane Nathan.

In October 2016, council elections were held in Brimbank for the first time in eight years. Two former councillors were re-elected: Sam David and Margaret Giudice, the latter having rescinded her Labor Party membership in 2014.

== Environmental issues ==
In 2021, Brimbank was recognised as Melbourne&#x27;s smelliest local government area with more than 640 complaints from residents mainly due to the large amount of industries in the area. This includes the Kealba Sunshine Landfill which produced a smell described as &quot;rotting carcasses&quot; for three years. EPA Victoria suspended and then cancelled the license to operate the landfill by Barro Group.

<text>Melton is a suburb on the outskirts of Melbourne, Victoria. The suburb is located west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District on the city&#x27;s western rural-urban fringe. It is the administrative centre of the City of Melton local government area. As of the 2021 Australian census, the suburb has a population of 7,953. 

Originally a country town along the Ballarat — Melbourne growth corridor, Melton was designated a satellite city of Melbourne in 1974. Along with the rest of the City of Melton, it forms a part of Greater Melbourne and counts as part of its population statistic. In 2023, Melbourne&#x27;s significant urban area boundary was expanded to include Melton.

Like the overall local government area, Melton was named after Melton Mowbray in the United Kingdom.

==History==

=== Pre-settlement history ===
The land to the east of the Werribee River is the traditional home of the Wurundjeri and Boon Wurrung people, and to the west, the traditional home of the Wadawurrung. Mount Cottrell is jointly managed by Wurundjeri and Boon Wurrung.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
Melton was first settled by squatters establishing sheep runs in the area in the 1830s and a small settlement benefited from traffic passing through it on the way to the Ballarat gold fields during the Victorian Gold Rush. The post office opened on 1 March 1856.

The population of Melton remained stable at around 1,000 - 1,500 until the mid 1950s, rising to 1800 in 1962 and doubling to 3600 in 1968. The first of the larger residential estates was Delphic Realty&#x27;s Melton Views Estate in 1964.

The area was declared a satellite city in 1974.

===21st century===
The overall City of Melton is forecast to grow in population by over 250,000 by 2051, however most of this growth is predicted to happen in the surrounding suburbs, particularly in Aintree, Caroline Springs, and Brookfield; the suburb of Melton itself is only predicted to grow 2% by 2051.

Melbourne&#x27;s significant urban area boundary was redefined to include Melton in 2023, leading to global headlines claiming that Melbourne&#x27;s population overtook Sydney&#x27;s.

According to census data, the suburb of Melton has had a relatively stable population since being recognised as a separate suburb on the 2006 census, where it had a population of 7,305. The population grew to 7,593 by 2011, then to 8,069 by 2016. The population lowered to 7,953 at the 2021 census.

==Geography and Climate==
Melton is located on mostly flat, largely featureless, former volcanic plains.

To the south-east of Melton is Mount Cottrell, a blast-shield volcano, and to the north-east of the suburb is Mount Kororoit. Mount Cottrell produced some of the largest lava flows in the western Victoria. These two volcanoes are some of the easternmost volcanoes on the Victorian Volcanic Plain which extends to the South Australian border.

Melton receives less rainfall than Melbourne due to the area&#x27;s position within the Otway Ranges rain shadow. The area has a profound urban heat island effect due to its ongoing rapid suburban development. There is some concern over how continued development and climate change will affect Melton, with particular concern focused on the loss of several threatened animal species&#x27; habitat, and an increased risk of bushfires and extreme weather events in the near future. The Melton City Council has noted that the area is &quot;particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change due to its moderate level of socio-economic disadvantage and large proportion of overseas-born residents&quot;, along with &quot;significant structural barriers to participating in low-carbon lifestyles including limited local employment opportunities, lack of access to public transport, and inefficient new housing developments&quot;. 

Precipitation records for Melton follow. 

==Arts and culture==
Each year the Djerriwarrh Festival is held in the city in November. The festival includes a street parade down High Street, two-day market stalls, and the Lions Club Carnival, held in the Police Paddock on High Street.

The Melton Library and Learning Hub was the first library in Australia to be awarded a 5 Star Green Star rating from the Green Building Council of Australia. It has a theatre, recording studio, wall space for exhibitions and runs several public events.

When the town was first established, the east end of High Street was the centre of town containing the police station, post office, court house, grocery stores, blacksmith, and pubs. High Street remains the main activity centre, with the surrounding streets forming the Melton Town Centre and the Central Walk Shopping Centre.

Melton has a botanic garden.

Golfers play at the course of the Melton Valley Golf Club on Melton Valley Drive.

==Governance==

Melton is the administrative centre for the City of Melton.

Its state electorate is the electoral district of Melton, and its federal electorate is the division of Hawke, currently held by Sam Rae. Since the electoral division&#x27;s inception in 1992, Melton has elected only Labor members. Hawke was won by Labor at its first election in 2022.

==Media==
Melton receives the same digital television stations as Melbourne. It is also within the broadcast range of all commercial radio stations from Melbourne, and is an end point for digital radio broadcasts in metropolitan Melbourne. Broadcast signals diminish towards the west.

Melton shares one local newspaper with the neighbouring Shire of Moorabool, the &quot;Melton &amp; Moorabool Star Weekly&quot;.

Melton has one local radio station, 979fm, and can receive Apple FM broadcasting from nearby Bacchus Marsh.

==Transport==
=== Road ===
Melton has been identified by the Department of Transport as one of the most car-dependent communities in Greater Melbourne. The Western Highway is the main road transport link from Melton to Melbourne. The Melton Highway links Melton to the Calder Highway — and thus to the Melbourne Airport — via nearby suburb Taylors Lakes.

=== Rail ===
Rail passengers use the Melton railway station located in neighbouring suburb Melton South. The Melton railway line forms part of the Ballarat V/Line rail service, with trains running to and from Melton Station once every 20 minutes during peak, once every 40 minutes off-peak, and once an hour on weekends.

Melton&#x27;s train service is known for being overcrowded. Funding was committed in the 2023 Victorian State Budget to investigate upgrading stations along the railway line to allow for larger nine-carriage V/Line VLocity trains to run on the line. Melton station is planned to be rebuilt in 2026, along with the removal of four level crossings between Melton and Deer Park railway station, as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project. 

Electrification of Melton&#x27;s rail line was recommended in Public Transport Victoria&#x27;s 2013 Network Development Plan and planned to be delivered as part of the Western Rail Plan. These plans initially included quadruplication of the Melton line to separate the Ballarat V/Line service from the future Melton Metro service. In 2023 it was reported that, while electrification to Melton is still planned for the future, track quadruplication is no longer part of the Western Rail Plan.

=== Air ===
The Melton Airfield, located in neighbouring suburb Toolern Vale, provides general aviation.

==Education==

<doc id="467337" wikidata="Q7375675" url="?curid=467337" title="Ruaraidh Erskine">
<text>Ruaraidh Erskine of Marr (15 January 1869 – 5 January 1960) (Scottish Gaelic: Ruaraidh Arascain is Mhàirr) was a Scottish nationalist political activist, writer and Scottish Gaelic language revival campaigner.

==Early life==
Ruaraidh Erskine was born &quot;The Honourable Stuart Richard Joseph Erskine&quot; at 1 Portland Place, Brighton, East Sussex, England on 15 January 1869. He was the third of the four children born to William Macnaghten Erskine, 5th Baron Erskine (1841–1913), an army officer, and his wife, Caroline Alice Martha Grimble. The family were descendants of the Erskine Earls of Buchan.

Erskine claimed that he learned to speak Scottish Gaelic from his childhood nanny, who came from Harris, and that this kindled the enthusiasm which was to be a main hallmark of his career. His imagination was fired early by the Irish nationalist movement and these combined influences, together with his family&#x27;s Scottish roots, led to his development as a prominent Gaelic nationalist, whose compelling dream was of a self-governing Celtic Scotland. As essential steps towards the realization of this dream he was actively involved in the fostering of Gaelic consciousness and in the extension of Gaelic usage, especially in the written form. He hoped that a significant extension of Scottish Gaelic literature would contribute to the raising of literary standards, in a reaction against what he saw as the degrading influence of music-hall and ‘pop’ culture on Gaelic verse in the second half of the nineteenth century. He probably also viewed his activity as a response to the dominance of folklore in the Gaelic literary world.

== Journalism and the Neo-Jacobite Revival==
In 1890, Erskine and Herbert Vivian co-founded &quot;The Whirlwind&quot;, a weekly newspaper. The paper was published for less than a year, but printed works by a number of notable artists, including Walter Sickert and James NcNeill Whistler. It advocated nationalism, peace, free trade and Irish Home Rule, and opposed female suffrage and socialism. It also espoused a Jacobite philosophy, and the restoration of the House of Stuart. Erskine, along with Vivian and Melville Henry Massue founded the Legitimist Jacobite League of Great Britain and Ireland in 1891, and he was president of the organisation in 1893, 1894 and 1897.

In 1891, he stood as a candidate for the Buteshire constituency as a &quot;Scottish Tory Home Ruler&quot;, but by October of that year, he had withdrawn.

In 1901, Erskine began to edit a new bilingual newspaper, &quot;Am Bàrd&quot;, which ran until July of the following year. In 1904, he launched &quot;Guth na Blaidhna&quot;, a bilingual periodical which promoted Scottish Gaelic language revival, Catholicism and a twentieth-century Counter-Reformation. It was published for 21 years, finally going out of business in 1925. Between February 1908 and February 1909 he published the weekly Gaelic language newspaper &quot;Alba&quot;, which covered a range of political and cultural matters, including land, crofting, fishing, Scottish Gaelic-medium education, early Scottish history and Gaelic song.

In 1914, Erskine revived &quot;The Scottish Review&quot;, a title which had been edited by the 3rd Marquess of Bute between 1882 and 1900. The journal&#x27;s political stance became leftist as well as nationalist. Contributors included the Aberdonian trade unionist William Diack, James Maxton of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), the author and poet Lewis Spence, and the Welsh Nationalist MP Edward Thomas John.

== Scottish nationalism ==
In 1892, aged 23, he became vice-president of the Scottish Home Rule Association, but he grew to oppose the notion of home rule for Scotland within the United Kingdom and went on to support Scottish independence.

In 1904 he formed the &quot;Guth na Bliadhna&quot; (Voice of the Year) publication and used it to advocate independence and a coming together of the Gaels of both Scotland and Ireland to aid each other in a campaign to establish their respective languages as the official language of their country. He also used the magazine to call for the formation of a political party to campaign for independence.
His activities with the publication brought him into contact with William Gillies, with whom he formed the Scots National League (SNL) in 1920, thus going some way towards the realisation of the formation of a Scottish nationalist political party.

Despite his aristocratic background, Erskine had links with the socialist figure John Maclean who was himself an advocate of an independent (socialist) Scotland. Erskine had at one stage described socialism as &quot;a predatory creed&quot;, but by the time of the First World War he was becoming more politically radical and finding sympathy with the cause of figures such as Maclean.

He championed the Easter Rising in Ireland in 1916, and attempted to foster links with the Irish nationalist community by attempting to set up a joint Scottish-Irish Celtic newspaper with Art O&#x27;Brian the president of the Irish Self Determination League.

Erskine attempted to get independent representation for Scotland at the Paris Peace Conference at the end of the First World War. In this he was ultimately unsuccessful, but it did attract the support of figures such as James Maxton, a prominent figure in the Independent Labour Party at the time.

Erskine and Gillies led the SNL into joining with other groups to form the National Party of Scotland (NPS) in 1928. The NPS was quite different in outlook to the SNL had been and many SNL members left the NPS due to this factor, including Erskine. After this, Erskine was to play little role in politics.

Erskine was long accused of being reactionary. Some of his ideas, however, have gained in popularity over time, e.g. Scottish independence, land reform (through the Highland Land League), and even the Scottish Gaelic language revival. His pan-Celticism has received attention from the Celtic Congress and Celtic League.

== Personal life ==
In May 1891, the engagement of Erskine and Muriel Lilias Colquhoun Graham was announced; they were married on 18 July 1891.

<text>Robert Adrain (30 September 1775 – 10 August 1843) was an Irish political exile who won renown as a mathematician in the United States. He left Ireland after leading republican insurgents in the Rebellion of 1798, and settled in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. With Nathaniel Bowditch, he shares the distinction of being the first scholar to publish original mathematical research in America. This included his formulation of the method of least squares while working on a surveying problem (in two proofs of the exponential law of error published independently of Carl Friedrich Gauss) for which he is chiefly remembered. His fields of applied mathematical interest included physics, astronomy and geodesy. Many of his mathematical investigations focussed on the shape of the Earth.

==Biography==
Adrain was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, Ireland. His father, of French Huguenot descent, was a school teacher and maker of mathematical instruments, and he apparently received a good education until he was fifteen when both his parents died. He then supported himself and his four siblings by assuming his father&#x27;s position as a teacher and as a private tutor. In the cause of democratic reform and national independence, on 7 June 1798 he led a contingent of United Irishmen in the rebel army commanded by Henry Joy McCracken at the Battle of Antrim. In the confrontation with British Crown forces, he was near fatally wounded by one of his own men. After being nursed back to health, with a bounty on his head he, his wife and infant child escaped to America. 

Although he was himself largely self-taught in mathematics, he secured a teaching position at the academy at Princeton, New Jersey. In 1801 he became president of the York County Academy in York, Pennsylvania. He wrote for the &quot;Mathematical Correspondent&quot; (edited by George Baron), the first mathematical journal in the United States, contributing the first article published in America on diophantine algebra. Later he twice attempted, in 1808 and 1814, to found his own journal, &quot;The Analyst, or, Mathematical Museum.&quot; While he failed to attract sufficient subscribers, the first volume of the &quot;Analyst&quot; has been considered &quot;the best collection of mathematical work produced in the United States up to that time&quot;. As well as from Adrain, it included contributions from Nathaniel Bowditch, Robert Patterson, John Gummere and Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler. Recognition followed. 

In 1809 Adrain was called to a professorship at Rutgers (then Queen&#x27;s) College which, in 1810, awarded him an honorary M.A.. In 1812 he was elected a Fellow of the American Philosophical Society and the next year, when he took a position at Columbia, of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. From 1827 he was Professor of Mathematics in the University of Pennsylvania

In 1825, he founded a somewhat more successful publication targeting a wider readership, &quot;The Mathematical Diary&quot;, which was published through 1832. It was fashioned after the &quot;Correspondent&quot;, but at a higher level of mathematical involvement in problems solving and exposition.

In 1834, Adrain was asked to resign from the University of Pennsylvania on grounds of class ill-discipline (instances of students overturning benches and throwing eggs). He returned to New Brunswick. He rented a school room and offered private tutoring until 1836. Local records in New Brunswick indicate that during the 1830s, he held in slavery a woman named Caroline and her son Alfred. After 1836, he returned to New York and taught at the Columbia College Grammar School before retiring to New Brunswick in 1840 where three years later he died.

It is suggested that Adrain, today, consistent with his conviction that &quot;the last and highest department of mathematical science consists in its application to the laws and phenomenon of the natural world&quot;, would be considered an applied mathematician. Among his broad interests in physics, astronomy and geography, his paramount concern was dynamic geodesy, specifically the mathematical investigation of the shape of the earth.

Adrain was the father of Congressman Garnett B. Adrain. He is commemorated by a blue plaque, unveiled at Carrickfergus by the Ulster History Circle.

<doc id="467343" wikidata="Q7203254" url="?curid=467343" title="Player's Handbook">
<text>The Player&#x27;s Handbook (spelled Players Handbook in first edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;)) is the name given to one of the core rulebooks in every edition of the fantasy role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;). It does not contain the complete set of rules for the game, and only includes rules for use by players of the game. Additional rules, for use by Dungeon Masters (DMs), who referee the game, can be found in the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;. Many optional rules, such as those governing extremely high-level players, and some of the more obscure spells, are found in other sources.

Since the first edition, the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; has contained tables and rules for creating characters, lists of the abilities of the different character classes, the properties and costs of equipment, descriptions of spells that magic-using character classes (such as wizards or clerics) can cast, and numerous other rules governing gameplay. Both the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; and the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; give advice, tips, and suggestions for various styles of play. For most editions of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, The &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;, and &quot;Monster Manual&quot; make up the core rulebooks.

==&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;==
The first &quot;Players Handbook&quot; was released in June 1978 as a 128-page hardcover. It was written by Gary Gygax and edited by Mike Carr, who also wrote the foreword. The original cover art was by D.A. Trampier, who also provided interior illustrations along with David C. Sutherland III. Numerous foreign editions of the &quot;Players Handbook&quot; were published, including versions for the United Kingdom, Australia, France, and Germany. Games Workshop (U.K.) published a softcover version also in 1978. In 1983, TSR changed the cover art of the &quot;Players Handbook&quot;, although the interior contents remained the same. This printing featured cover art by Jeff Easley. Printings with this cover also bear an orange spine that fits in with other &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; books. Dealers continued to place orders for the 1st edition &quot;Players Handbook&quot; even after 2nd edition was released, causing the final printing to be in July 1990, a year after the release of 2nd edition.

Shannon Appelcline highlighted that &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;is one of the few roleplaying games to maintain a split between core books for players and game masters throughout most of its history&quot; and this split started with the release of the &quot;Players Handbook&quot; (1978), followed by the release of the &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot; (1979). The &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; core game rules were divided between these books, and the open-ended nature of the new rules mandated that for game campaigns to be run successfully they would now need a referee or Dungeon Master. The &quot;Players Handbook&quot; contained the information that players needed for playing the standard character classes: cleric, druid, fighter, ranger, paladin, magic-user, illusionist, thief, assassin, and monk. The book also included information on non-human races, such as dwarves, elves, and halflings, as well as character abilities, equipment such as armor and weapons, descriptions of spells, and optional rules to add psionics to the game. Appelcline noted that TSR mostly published books aimed at Dungeon Masters after the release of the core rulebooks until &quot;the release of &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; (1985), which could easily have been called &#x27;Player&#x27;s Handbook 2&#x27;, and &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; (1985), an &#x27;alternate players handbook&#x27; for the east&quot;.

In 1999, a paperback reprint of the first edition was released. In 2012, Wizards of the Coast released a new printing of the original book, billed as the &quot;1st Edition Premium Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, as part of a set of limited-edition reprints of the original 1st Edition core rulebooks: the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, and &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;. These premium versions of the original &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; rulebooks were reprinted with the original art and content, but feature a new cover design. Purchase of the reprinted &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; helped support the Gygax Memorial Fund—established to immortalize Gary Gygax with a memorial statue in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

The original &quot;Players Handbook&quot; was reviewed by Don Turnbull in issue No. 10 of &quot;White Dwarf&quot;, who gave the book a rating of 10 out of 10. Turnbull noted, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen a product sell so quickly as did the &quot;Handbook&quot; when it first appeared on the Games Workshop stand at Dragonmeet&quot;, a British role-playing game convention; after the convention, he studied the book and concluded that &quot;whereas the original rules are ambiguous and muddled, the &quot;Handbook&quot; is a detailed and coherent game-system, and very sophisticated.&quot; Turnbull felt a bit of apprehension at the amount of time it would require to digest all the new material, but concluded by saying &quot;I said of the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; that it was TSR&#x27;s most impressive publication to date; that is no longer true—this accolade must belong to the &quot;Handbook&quot; which is nothing short of a triumph.&quot;

Scott Taylor for &quot;Black Gate&quot; in 2014 listed the 1st edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; cover by artist David Trampier as #1 in &quot;The Top 10 TSR Cover Paintings of All Time&quot;. Then in 2016, Taylor listed the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; as #5 on the list of &quot;Top 10 &#x27;Orange Spine&#x27; &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; Hardcovers By Jeff Easley, saying &quot;you aren&#x27;t going to top Trampier&#x27;s version, but nonetheless, for many players who didn&#x27;t start &quot;D&amp;D&quot; in the 1980s, THIS is their &quot;Players Handbook&quot;, and many of us have imagined this fantastic fight as we sat around a gaming table.&quot;

== &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition&quot; ==

The &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was a 256-page hardcover book written by David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook and released in 1989. The original cover art is by Jeff Easley, and the book featured eight full-page illustrations in color. Gary Gygax originally started development of the next edition of &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; and planned on incorporating rules revisions from the &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; (1985) and &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; (1985) in a new &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;. However, Gygax was forced out of TSR by the end of 1985 &quot;and his plans for second edition were abandoned&quot;. In 1986, Editor Steve Winter convinced management at TSR that the game needed more than a &quot;reorganization&quot; and instead that the game &quot;should be redeveloped&quot;; Winter and Cook then spent several years developing &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd Edition. In August 1987, Director of Games Development Michael Dobson outlined that &quot;the two core books were to be done by December 1987, then turned over to the RPGA for playtesting in early 1988, then returned to TSR for redevelopment in late 1988&quot; aiming to release in &quot;March or April 1989&quot;. Shannon Appelcline highlighted that &quot;Dobson&#x27;s scheduling was quite accurate, as the 2e &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1989) appeared in February 1989, then the 2e &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; (1989) in May&quot;.

The &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1989) for 2nd edition was designed to be compatible with 1st edition rules, but the information in the book was streamlined and clarified. Appelcline commented that unlike the previous &quot;Players Handbook&quot; (1978), &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1989) became the larger &quot;core rulebook of the game&quot; and included most of &quot;the character creation rules and &quot;everything&quot; else that players should know&quot;. The book contained the information on how to play the standard character classes organized in categories consisting of warriors (fighters, paladins, and rangers), wizards (mages and specialist wizards such as illusionists), priests (clerics, with guidelines for variance by mythos, including the druid as an example), and rogues (thieves and bards); while most character classes remained similar to their versions in the 1st edition rules, the bard was regularized to function more like the other classes, and the assassin and monk were removed. TSR, Inc. also removed some races from the game, such as half-orcs, although some of these were added back into the game in supplements, such as &quot;The Complete Book of Humanoids&quot;.

Appelcline noted that following the release of the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1989), TSR published a &quot;player-focused series of splatbooks, the &quot;PHBR&quot; &quot;Complete&quot; series (1989-1995)&quot;; in the TSR code system, &quot;PHBR&quot; stood for &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; reference series. It was in the &quot;Player&#x27;s Option: Spells &amp; Magic&quot; sourcebook for the second edition that the artificer was first introduced, as a specialist choice for magic users specifically. A set of optional rules for &quot;proficiencies&quot; was added, to represent skills, and sections detailing role-playing, combat, magic, time and movement, equipment, and spell descriptions were all expanded from the original book. The book included major changes regarding character classes, races, and magic, and incorporated many new rules that had been published in supplements such as &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; (1985) and &quot;Dragonlance Adventures&quot; (1987).
In 1995, a new version of the 2nd edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was released as part of TSR&#x27;s 25th anniversary. The book was revised, becoming sixty-four pages larger, mainly due to layout changes and new artwork. A new foreword in this edition specifically stated that the book was not &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition.

The 2nd edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was reproduced as a premium reprint on May 21, 2013.

===Reception===

In the May 1989 edition of &quot;Games International&quot;, James Wallis called the 2nd edition &quot;an improvement over the original&quot;, but concluded that it was &quot;a step forward for the game, but a very small step.&quot; Wallis felt that the many improvements called for by the &quot;archaic mechanics&quot; and &quot;hugely overly-complex&quot; rules had not been addressed, and that the game still provided &quot;a terrible introduction to role-playing.&quot; He concluded that the designer &quot;lacked the vision to see what could have been done with the material&quot;, and gave the book a below-average rating of 2 out of 5, saying, &quot;&quot;AD&amp;D&quot; may be the biggest selling rolegame of all time, but like the IBM PC, that doesn&#x27;t mean that it isn&#x27;t thoroughly obsolete and to be avoided.&quot;

The 2nd edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was an Origins and Gamer&#x27;s Choice award winner. Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book &quot;Heroic Worlds&quot;, called the book &quot;a vast improvement&quot; over the 1st edition book; he noted that the monk character class had been &quot;banished to &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; where it belongs&quot;, but commented that the spell descriptions &quot;have positively bloated to over 100 pages&quot;.

Stephan Wieck reviewed the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; within a broader review of the 2nd Edition rules in a 1989 issue of &quot;White Wolf&quot;. He saw the revised rules as a clear improvement. He noted that its &quot;interior is laid out very well and is graphically attractive&quot; with a helpful color scheme.

==&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition ==

The third edition, published August 10, 2000, (with the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; debuting at that year&#x27;s Gen Con, in August 2000) represented a major overhaul of the game, including the adoption of the d20 system. The third edition also dropped the word &quot;Advanced&quot; from the title, as the publisher decided to publish only one version of the game instead of both basic and advanced versions.

Monte Cook, Jonathan Tweet, and Skip Williams all contributed to the 3rd edition &quot;Players Handbook&quot;, &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;, and &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions. Tweet is credited with the book&#x27;s design. The 3rd edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; also saw the return of half-orcs and monks to the core rules set, along with some all-new classes.

The reviewer from &quot;Pyramid&quot; commented on the release of third edition, stating: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot to like about &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; 3rd Edition as seen in the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;. The new artwork is gorgeous and evocative, and in the 286 pages of the main rulebook there&#x27;s a lot of well-written and tightly packed rules.&quot; Another reviewer wrote a response to the first review. A third reviewer felt that the design team &quot;smoothed out the rough edges from &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragon&quot; 2nd Edition and added tons of new goodies to make &quot;D&amp;D&quot; 3rd Edition the best combat-oriented RPG you can buy&quot;.

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; v3.5 ===
In July 2003, the rules were revised again to version 3.5 based on two years of player feedback. Revisions to the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; included the classes becoming more balanced against each other. Andy Collins explained that he was originally put in charge of &quot;evaluating the 3.0 &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; to see if there were places where the rules could stand any improvement or upgrades&quot; as a &quot;thought experiment for R&amp;D&quot;; however, by winter 2001, there was a shift to developing &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; v3.5 to reflect the game&#x27;s rapid evolution. Collins was put in charge of the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2003) development with Rich Redman on the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2003) and Skip Williams on the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2003). When asked about the changes from the prior &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2000) release, Williams said &quot;I think they range from the almost invisible (unless it affects your character directly) to the pretty radical,&quot; while Collins replied &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d call any of the changes &#x27;radical.&#x27; Even though some characters will undergo some significant changes, the aim is for the character to still feel like the same character, only with more interesting and balanced options.&quot; Monte Cook, one of the lead designers of the 3rd Edition who left Wizards of the Coast in 2001, was critical of v3.5 in his review of the new core rulebooks – &quot;this revision is too much, too soon. In fact, it&#x27;s much more than just a &#x27;revision.&#x27; That said, most of the changes it presents are good. The bad changes, thankfully, won&#x27;t have a huge impact on your game&quot;. Cook claimed that this new edition &quot;was motivated by financial need rather than by design need&quot;. 

May 2006 saw the release of the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook II&quot;, designed to follow up the standard &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;. This book was designed by David Noonan. It contains four new classes, along with new spells, feats, and new role-playing options. Its cover pays homage to the 1st edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;.
The 3.5 edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was reproduced as a premium reprint on September 18, 2012.
==&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition ==

On June 6, 2008, the Fourth Edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, subtitled &quot;Arcane, Divine and Martial Heroes&quot;, was released. It was originally announced that the 4th edition&#x27;s three core rulebooks would be released over a three-month period, but the date changed after customer feedback revealed a majority preference among D&amp;D customers to have all three core rulebooks released in the same month. The Fourth Edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was designed by Rob Heinsoo, Andy Collins, and James Wyatt. The front cover illustration was by Wayne Reynolds and the back cover illustration was by Dan Scott.

The first &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; includes eight classes: cleric, fighter, paladin, ranger, rogue, warlock, warlord, and wizard, and eight races: dragonborn, dwarf, eladrin, elf, human, half-elf, halfling, and tiefling. The warlock and warlord classes, and the dragonborn and tiefling races, represented new additions to the core rules, while the book left out previous core elements such as the monk and bard classes and the gnome and half-orc races. Wizards of the Coast emphasized that those elements would be coming in subsequent &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbooks&quot; and would be considered to be as central to the game as those in the first book. Shannon Appelcline highlighted that the omission of some classic character classes and races was considered controversial – &quot;the designers later said that they regretted not saying that the first &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was just a starting place for D&amp;D 4e&quot; as &quot;more races and classes would appear in the years to come&quot;.

Appelcline opined that the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2008) was notable for being &quot;the most complete player&#x27;s rulebook ever produced for&quot; &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; since it contained &quot;all the character creation rules&quot;, &quot;all the other core rules&quot; and &quot;first time ever it included magic items&quot;. He explained that one of the 4th Edition goals was &quot;moving the game away from being a simulation and toward being a more cinematic gaming experience – something that would allow players to simply reskin their character fluff without it changing the game itself&quot; and so player character classes saw &quot;the biggest revamp&quot;. He highlighted that fewer roleplaying aspects were codified while the gameplay mechanics were &quot;more focused on combat than in previous editions&quot; making battle maps very important; the healing surge mechanic reflected the importance of combat while &quot;spells and other abilities that weren&#x27;t combat-oriented either disappeared or were revamped&quot;.

The 4th edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook 2&quot;, subtitled &quot;Arcane, Divine and Primal Heroes&quot;, was released on March 17, 2009. The &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook 2&quot; includes eight classes: the avenger, barbarian, bard, druid, invoker, shaman, sorcerer, and warden, and five races: the deva, gnome, goliath, half-orc, and shifter. The book reached No. 28 on &quot;USA Today&quot;″s bestseller list the week of March 26, 2009 and No. 14 on the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;″s non-fiction bestseller list a week later.

A third book in the series, &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook 3&quot;, subtitled &quot;Psionic, Divine and Primal Heroes&quot;, was released on March 16, 2010. The book was designed by Mike Mearls, Bruce R. Cordell, and Robert J. Schwalb, and featured cover art by Michael Komarck. It includes six classes: ardent, battlemind, monk, psion, runepriest, and seeker, along with four races: wilden, the minotaur, githzerai, and shardminds. The PHB3 also includes new multi-classing rules for hybrid characters.

===Reception===

John Baichtal of &quot;Wired&quot; highlighted that he liked the various character changes included in the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2008) – &quot;a lot of people have been talking about how MMPORGs have influenced D&amp;D, particularly toward making advancement more fun. There are cool new powers at nearly every level, and all the classes are equally balanced&quot;. He commented that the shift between 3.5 and 4th Edition is &quot;as profound as between, say, 1st Edition AD&amp;D and 3.5&quot;. He also liked the healing surge ability the sourcebook introduced as it allows player characters (PCs) &quot;to be more adventurous and daring&quot;. However, he &quot;didn&#x27;t like&quot; how various classes and races (such as bard, barbarian, druid, monk, gnome, and half-orc) were left out of the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2008). Baichtal opined that 4th Edition &quot;certainly isn&#x27;t a token update to sell more books&quot; with &quot;thoughtful&quot; changes and an &quot;easy start that makes newbie PCs tough enough to take care of business&quot;.

==&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition ==
The 5th Edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was released on August 19, 2014 by Wizards of the Coast. The &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; contains the basic rules of the 5e system, the base classes and races, and character customization options. The cover art by Tyler Jacobson features King Snurre, from &quot;The Hall of the Fire Giant King&quot; (1978) adventure module, looming over two heroes engaged in battle with him. Jacobson explained that &quot;the angle is so extreme in order to convey a desperate battle again such a giant foe. I wanted to put the female hero in a pose that seemed very &#x27;last ditch effort&#x27; to cast a spell and possibly take him out [...]. But mainly I just wanted a composition that was very action-packed&quot;. He also highlighted the blue magic &quot;about to be cast&quot; by the heroine as the focal point with the bright color contrasting &quot;the hot colors everywhere else in the image&quot;.

Wizards of the Coast rereleased the three core rulebooks as part of a bundled boxset, titled &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Core Rulebooks Gift Set&quot;, in November 2018; the rulebooks contain the errata for the edition. An alternative edition of the set, with new cover art by Hydro74, was only available through local game stores. Gavin Sheehan for &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; highlighted that the alternative cover art of the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; features &quot;the &#x27;welcoming&#x27; face of King Snurre, iron helmet and all looking at you like you don&#x27;t belong here and why shouldn&#x27;t he put you down? I love the design of his helmet cast in a slightly deeper red with orange eyes and bear shining underneath&quot;.

=== Reception ===
In &quot;Publishers Weekly&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Best-selling Books Week Ending September 1, 2014&quot;, &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was #1 in &quot;Hardcover Nonfiction&quot; and sold 22,090 units; it was #7 on the overall bestseller list. It remained in the &quot;Hardcover Nonfiction&quot; top 25 for four weeks. The &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was the top selling book at Amazon on its release day. The 5th edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; won the 2015 Origins Award for Best Role Playing Game and Fan Favorite Role Playing Game. The book won three 2015 gold ENnie Awards, &quot;Best Game&quot;, &quot;Best Rules&quot;, &quot;Product of the Year&quot;, and one silver award for &quot;Best Writing&quot; by Jeremy Crawford, James Wyatt, Robert J. Schwalb, and Bruce R. Cordell.

Jeff LaSala &quot;of Tor.com&quot; commented that &quot;there&#x27;s no denying&quot; the &quot;visual appeal&quot; of the covers for the 5th Edition sourcebooks and that he was &quot;extremely satisfied to see the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;&#x27;s cover at last give us an action heroine in sensible clothing—quite a contrast to last edition&#x27;s &quot;PHB&quot; cover. Whatever anyone thinks of the overall format and design of these books, that&#x27;s a huge win&quot;. Andrew Zimmerman Jones of &quot;Black Gate&quot; commented on the 5th edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;: &quot;Their rules light approach make it a natural system for old fans to bring new players into the hobby, but even with this initial offering there are enough customization options to keep old school gamers happy playing with it.&quot; Chuck Francisco of &quot;Mania.com&quot; commented: &quot;While it was an easily accessible system, 4e left a lukewarm feeling with my gaming group. There was something too generic and uninteresting about player characters which pervaded the system, especially in the wake of 3.5e (which some felt provided too many options so as to be confusing). In the process, 4e characters lost an indescribable crunchy feeling, but I&#x27;m pleased to say that it&#x27;s been brought back for the newest installment of this venerated table top series.&quot; In comparing the 2014 &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; to the 1978 &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, James Floyd Kelly of GeekDad viewed the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; sourcebook as both &quot;outstandingly fun&quot; and &quot;a product of its time&quot; while &quot;this new 5th edition feels streamlined... and much more accessible&quot;. Kelly commented that &quot;the writing is much more polished. The artwork more inspiring. And the overall look and feel (with the layout of the graphical elements and charts and the organization of material) is appealing both visually and for comprehension. New gamers are going to find this new material fun to read – at no time did I feel bogged down as I was reading&quot;.

Henry Glasheen of &quot;SLUG Magazine&quot; highlighted getting &quot;lost in the artwork&quot; of the 2014 &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; as the new edition&#x27;s &quot;art has the patient beauty of old-school high adventure, amped up with a distinctly modern aesthetic&quot; and &quot;everything has this magnificent watercolor texture that, while obviously digital in most cases, gives each piece a familiar, knowable feel&quot;. John Farrell at &quot;Gaming Trend&quot; called the 2014 &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; artwork &quot;both iconic and evocative&quot; although &quot;of questionable quality in very few places&quot;. Glasheen enjoyed the character creation process including the new Background system and thought making the Feats system optional &quot;de-clutters the game and removes the incentive to try and break system mechanics&quot;. Similarly, Farrell commented that &quot;character creation is fast and easy, without an overload of options at the outset&quot; and with a simpler ruleset, this edition &quot;has found substantial yet unobtrusive ways to bring your thoughts to roleplay without enforcing rigid methods of keeping in line with an archetype&quot;. In terms of gameplay, Farrell highlighted the &quot;simplicity of the actions&quot; which makes &quot;combat more fast-paced&quot; and praised the bounded accuracy of the game. Farrell thought that the &quot;game is fun, simply put, and guaranteed to pull new players into the fold&quot;. Glasheen commented that while the game is less complex than previous editions, 5th Edition &quot;is easily my favorite, ranking even higher than D&amp;D 3.5, my first love in D&amp;D&quot;. However, those looking for &quot;a hardcore RPG to test your skills at optimizing characters and crunching numbers&quot; are probably not going to enjoy 5th Edition as much since the focus &quot;is heavy on story and keeps the mechanics fast and loose&quot;.

=== 2024 revision ===
The backward compatible &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2024), as part of the 2024 revision to the 5th Edition ruleset, updates preexisting player options while introducing new content to the game. The sourcebook was released globally on September 17, 2024. Wizards of the Coast released a limited number of copies for sale six weeks early at Gen Con; local game stores in the Wizards Play Network were allowed to release the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; for early access on September 3, 2024. The digital edition on D&amp;D Beyond also came with early access for subscribers who pre-ordered. 

Wizards of the Coast also released an alternate cover edition which will be available only in local game stores; shipping delays pushed the release of the alternate cover outside of North America to October 2024. The standard edition features cover art by Tyler Jacobson and the alternate cover features art by Wylie Beckert. Alex Meehan, for &quot;Dicebreaker&quot;, highlighted that the standard edition features a party of adventurers with &quot;a friendly golden dragon standing behind them&quot; and the &quot;artwork strongly implies that the group is in the midst of a battle&quot;. In comparing the cover of the 2024 &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; to the 2014 &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, Matt Bassil of &quot;Wargamer&quot; commented that &quot;the old cover is an obvious power fantasy: look how powerful you can become and the cool things you can fight&quot; while the new cover has a different focus: &quot;look at the variety of DnD races and classes you can play, and the cool people you&#x27;ll be hanging out with&quot;. Bassil thought it was &quot;interesting that Wizards&quot; chose to highlight the group dynamic on the 2024 cover, which &quot;wasn&#x27;t such a priority in 2014&quot;. He also saw it as a clear attempt to &quot;champion diversity&quot; and convey that &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;is for everyone&quot;. Meehan commented that the 2024 alternate cover &quot;gives off a very different vibe&quot; with the party in cave &quot;sharing a pot of tea&quot; and &quot;included within this serene tea party is a golden dragon – somewhat linking things back to the standard cover – who grasps a normal-sized tea cup in one massive paw, with the party&#x27;s rogue balancing on part of the dragon&#x27;s body above&quot;. Josh Herman, head of art at Wizards of the Coast, commented that they liked making a &quot;not so aggressive&quot; cover which is &quot;a sweeter, calmer version of&quot; the standard cover. Herman explained that combat is a &quot;huge pillar of D&amp;D, but sometimes a lot of what D&amp;D is, is just storytelling&quot; and the alternate cover reflects the camp downtime the party has between adventures.

==== Reception ====
Wizards of the Coast announced that the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2024) was &quot;the fastest-selling &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; product ever&quot; and surpassed &quot;Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything&quot; (2020) to become &quot;the biggest product launch in the game&#x27;s 50-year history&quot;. Scott Thorne of &quot;ICv2&quot; noted that data service BookScan, which publishes &quot;weekly sales figures of trade book sales in the U.S. from most chain retailers and over 800 independent booksellers&quot; and covers &quot;about 85% of the market&quot;, reported &quot;a total of 3,773 copies sold&quot;. Thorne viewed BookScan as an accurate accounting of bookstore sales, however, not an accurate accounting of every sale as very few hobby game stores report their sales to BookScan and BookScan&#x27;s figures do not appear to include the 3,000 copies sold at GenCon.

Benjamin Abbott of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; commented that &quot;with this 2024 update, the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; is finally as lavish as you&#x27;d expect&quot; and that in the 2014 edition, &quot;too much was left to your imagination. Class pages, some of the most used in the game, were frequently limited to one or two illustrations and decorative elements apiece, while the spell section was an unrelenting wall of text&quot;. Abbott highlighted that &quot;alongside a much grander piece of hero art for each class (which proudly takes up a whole page this time), each subclass also gets an evocative illustration&quot;, every character background has &quot;a landscape or scene that begs you to imagine your character there&quot;, and there is &quot;artwork displaying how a spell works every page or two – and it&#x27;s actually quite compelling, showing off how magic works&quot;. Beside the art, Abbott thought &quot;in direct contrast to previous editions where sections bled together&quot;, the 2024 edition has a more sensible layout design and emphasizes reader accessibility. Joshua Rivera, in a pre-release review for &quot;Polygon&quot;, thought that the 2014 &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was &quot;clearly built with the assumption that the reader arrives with some level of buy-in or, preferably, someone to guide them&quot; while the 2024 &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; is a &quot;modern and clean reworking of the first book every D&amp;D player reads&quot; and is far more accessible than its predecessor. He highlighted the thoughtful layout and that while &quot;rules are explained when necessary&quot;, more complicated aspects &quot;are relegated to a glossary in the appendices&quot;. Rivera commented that this updated sourcebook is &quot;better suited to how the game is played in 2024&quot; and &quot;feels well-planned in a way previous books haven&#x27;t, offering an organic path through the game&#x27;s concepts and ideas&quot;. Following the release, Charlie Hall of &quot;Polygon&quot; also emphasized the &quot;user-friendly&quot; aspects of the sourcebook which he thought &quot;seamlessly&quot; onboards players – &quot;lead graphic designer Matt Cole and art director Emi Tanji should be given medals, because the very shape of the brand feels suddenly glossy, modern, and new&quot;. However, Hall criticized the digital edition on D&amp;D Beyond as the platform is &quot;cluttered and complex, so filled with speed bumps and interruptions&quot;; while he recommended purchasing the physical sourcebook, Hall also recommended avoiding D&amp;D Beyond &quot;unless you know exactly what you&#x27;re doing&quot;.

Chase Carter of &quot;Rascal&quot; commented that while he &quot;ultimately&quot; echoed Hall&#x27;s &quot;plea to buy a physical copy of the 2024 &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;&quot;, and to do so from the local community if you&#x27;re purchasing the new sourcebook, he also emphasized that he &quot;can&#x27;t recommend anyone purchase D&amp;D 2024&#x27;s &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;&quot;. He criticized Wizards of the Coast for releasing the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; months before the other two core rulebooks in a move &quot;that&#x27;s simply prioritized towards the largest population of wallets&quot; and opined that you can&#x27;t truly review the 2024 update with only one core rulebook. Christian Hoffer of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; viewed the 2024 &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; as &quot;an improvement from its 2014 predecessor in almost every single way&quot; since the sourcebook &quot;is more accessible, has better art, a better layout, and has clearer rules&quot;. Hoffer highlighted that the update &quot;played it safe&quot; and that the sourcebook features many changes which &quot;were either already implemented via different expansions or exist in the same design space as third-party material&quot;. Hoffer opined that &quot;the designers should be acknowledged&quot; for their work on improving the game, &quot;however, nothing about the new &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; excites me as a veteran DM or makes me want to play &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; more than I already did&quot;. Mollie Russell of &quot;Wargamer&quot; rated the 2024 &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; a 9 out 10 and commented that a close reading of the sourcebook shows a &quot;complex web of small changes&quot; but at a distance, while playing, &quot;things still feel like fifth edition. The broader experience hasn&#x27;t been innovated much, but on the bright side, that means it&#x27;s just as fun to play as it was before&quot;. Russell thought that the sourcebook &quot;loses a sense of place and character&quot; in terms of world-building and there are some &quot;issues with homogenisation&quot;, however, &quot;the structure of the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; is more logical, efficient, and beginner-friendly&quot; and &quot;most of the new rules you come across will delight rather than dismay&quot;.

<doc id="467347" wikidata="Q1132608" url="?curid=467347" title="Fiat Croma">
<text>The Fiat Croma name was used for two distinct large family cars by Fiat, one a five door liftback manufactured and marketed from 1985 to 1996, and after a nine-year hiatus, a crossover station wagon manufactured and marketed from 2004 to 2010. 

==First generation (1985–1996)==

The original Croma (Type 154) was a five door notchback liftback styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro of Italdesign using the Type Four platform, cooperatively used with the Saab 9000, Lancia Thema and Alfa Romeo 164. 

Released in December 1985, it was marketed in the large family car segment, replacing the Argenta in the Fiat lineup. The Croma was the first large car produced by Fiat to feature a transverse mounted engine and front wheel drive.

===Facelift===
The Croma received a light facelift for 1988, first shown in Frankfurt in September 1987. The black plastic between the rear lamps was now ridged rather than smooth, the lower portion of the bumpers were body coloured, and the turn signals received clear glass rather than amber. 

The front appearance received some other light modifications to bring its appearance in line with that of the recently introduced Tipo.

A more significant facelift was released in January 1991, with a new front design, including changes to the lights, bumpers, grille and sheet metal changes to wings and bonnet. Also in 1991, the direct injected diesel engine was equipped with a variable geometry turbocharger (&quot;VNT&quot;). Another facelift was released in June 1993.

Production ended in December 1996, and Fiat left the large family car segment. The Bravo/Brava based Marea small family car debuted at the same time as the Croma ceased production.

===Engines===
The Croma was available with a variety of petrol and diesel engines, most of the petrol units coming from Fiat&#x27;s Twin Cam engine family.

Base models had a single cam 1,585 cc four-cylinder engine rated at and the larger 1,995 cc, &quot;Controlled High Turbulence&quot; (CHT) engine rated at , followed by two fuel injected 2.0 litre twin cam powerplants, one with and the other a turbocharged and intercooled version rated at .

The later 2.5 L V6 petrol unit was from Alfa Romeo, but as with the 1.6 L engine it was not available in all markets. The 2.0 CHT model was designed specifically to provide low fuel consumption under light and medium loads thanks to two separate inlet manifolds of different diameters.

The Fiat Croma was the first passenger car in the world to have a direct injection Diesel (Turbo D i.d.) engine, going on sale in 1988. The 1.9 L fitted with a turbocharger with direct injection produces . It joined the 2,499 cc unit supplied by Iveco, with a normally aspirated version giving and a turbocharged one with . The latter version replaced the original 2,445 cc with .

Diesel engined variants of the Croma were not marketed in the United Kingdom.

==Second generation (2005–2010)==
In March 2005, Fiat introduced the second generation Croma: a large high-roof, six passenger, crossover wagon with an upright tailgate, with styling by Italdesign. 

Reflecting Fiat&#x27;s short term joint venture with General Motors, the new Croma, internally designated the Type 194, used an extended variant of the GM Epsilon platform sharing components with the Opel Vectra, Opel Signum and Saab 9-3. It was presented at the Geneva Motor Show in spring 2005 and went on sale in Italy in June of that year. 

Aware of its lack of image in the upper market segments, Fiat opted for developing a &quot;Comfort Wagon&quot;, an automobile with design elements of both estates and large MPVs, instead of developing a standard large family car like the previous model.

Its height of falls between that of the Mitsubishi Grandis and Ford S-Max large MPVs ( and respectively) and SEAT Altea XL (). In February 2007, Fiat UK announced that the Croma would no longer be generally available in the United Kingdom, after less than 900 had been sold in 2005.

The car was still offered, but only on special order, with right-hand drive models manufactured to customer specifications. Production of the second generation Croma ended at the end of 2010 and the car was replaced by the Dodge-based Fiat Freemont.

===Safety===
The Croma features seven airbags, anti-lock braking system, electronic brakeforce distribution, and received a five star Euro NCAP crash rating for adult occupant protection:
===Facelift===

The Croma received a facelift in November 2007, and was termed the &quot;Nuova Croma&quot;, featuring a revised grille, headlights, rear bumper, as well as interior changes, now designated a &quot;Station Wagon&quot; rather than &quot;Comfort Wagon&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;italiaspeed.com/new_models/2007&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Nuova Croma&quot; was only sold in mainland Europe, excluding the United Kingdom.

===Engines===
The Croma ws manufactured at Fiat&#x27;s Cassino factory with three trim levels and five engine options. As with the chassis, petrol engines were supplied by Opel, beginning with the brand new evolution of the Family 1 &quot;Ecotec&quot; 1.8 L with , followed by the torquier L850 &quot;Ecotec&quot; 2.2 L with .

Most examples featured Fiat&#x27;s own Multijet engine, available in three variants 1.9 L with 8 valves and , 1.9 L with 16 valves and , and the range topping, five-cylinder 2.4 L 20V with . The diesel engines were fitted with a standard six-speed manual gearbox, a six-speed automatic was also available and was standard on the 2.4 engines.

<text>The Suwannee River (also spelled Suwanee River or Swanee River) is a river that runs through south Georgia southward into Florida in the Southern United States. It is a wild blackwater river, about long. The Suwannee River is the site of the prehistoric Suwanee Straits that separated the Florida peninsula from the Florida panhandle and the rest of the continent. Spelled as &quot;Swanee&quot;, it is the namesake of two famous songs: &quot;Way Down Upon the Swanee River&quot; (1851) and &quot;Swanee&quot; (1919).

==Geography==
The headwaters of the Suwannee River are in the Okefenokee Swamp in the town of Fargo, Georgia. The river runs southwestward into the Florida Panhandle, then drops in elevation through limestone layers into a rare Florida whitewater rapid. Past the rapid, the Suwanee turns west near the town of White Springs, Florida, then connects to the confluences of the Alapaha River and Withlacoochee River.

The confluences of these three rivers form the southern borderline of Hamilton County, Florida. The Suwanee then bends southward near the town of Ellaville, followed by Luraville, then joins together with the Santa Fe River from the east, south of the town of Branford.

The river ends and drains into the Gulf of Mexico on the outskirts of Suwannee.

==Etymology==
The Spanish recorded the native Timucua name of &quot;Guacara&quot; for the river that would later become known as the Suwannee&quot;.&quot; Different etymologies have been suggested for the modern name.
* San Juan: D.G. Brinton first suggested in his 1859 &quot;Notes on the Floridian Peninsula&quot; that Suwannee was a corruption of the Spanish San Juan. This theory is supported by Jerald Milanich, who states that &quot;Suwannee&quot; developed through &quot;San Juan-ee&quot; from the 17th century Spanish mission of San Juan de Guacara, located on the Suwannee River. 
* Shawnee: The migrations of the Shawnee (Shawnee: &quot;Shaawanwaki;&quot; Muscogee: &quot;Sawanoke)&quot; throughout the South have also been connected to the name Suwannee. As early as 1820, the Indian agent John Johnson said &quot;the &#x27;Suwaney&#x27; river was doubtless named after the Shawanoese [Shawnee], Suwaney being a corruption of Shawanoese.&quot; However, the primary southern Shawnee settlements were along the Savannah River, with only the village of Ephippeck on the Apalachicola River being securely identified in Florida, casting doubt on this etymology.
* &quot;Echo&quot;: In 1884, Albert S. Gatschet claimed that Suwannee derives from the Creek word &quot;sawani,&quot; meaning &quot;echo&quot;, rejecting the earlier Shawnee theory. Stephen Boyd&#x27;s 1885 &quot;Indian Local Names with Their Interpretation&quot; and Henry Gannett&#x27;s 1905 work &quot;The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States&quot; repeat this interpretation&quot;,&quot; calling &quot;sawani&quot; an &quot;Indian word&quot; for &quot;echo river&quot;. Gatschet&#x27;s etymology also survives in more recent publications, often mistaking the language of translation. For example, a University of South Florida website states that the &quot;Timucuan Indian word Suwani means Echo River ... River of Reeds, Deep Water, or Crooked Black Water&quot;. In 2004, William Bright repeats it again, now attributing the name &quot;Suwanee&quot; to a Cherokee village of &quot;Sawani&quot;, which is unlikely as the Cherokee never lived in Florida or south Georgia. This etymology is now considered doubtful: 2004&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary of Creek Muscogee&quot; does not include the river as a place-name derived from Muscogee, and also lacks entries for &quot;echo&quot; and for words such as &quot;svwane, sawane,&quot; or &quot;svwvne&quot;, which would correspond to the anglicization &quot;Suwannee&quot;&quot;.&quot;

==History==

The Suwannee River area has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years. During the first millennium it was inhabited by the people of the Weedon Island culture, and around the year 900 a derivative local culture known as the Suwanee River Valley culture developed.

By the 16th century, the river was inhabited by two closely related Timuca-speaking peoples: the Yustaga, who lived on the west side of the river; and the Northern Utina, who lived on the east side. By 1633, the Spanish had established the missions of San Juan de Guacara, San Francisco de Chuaquin, and San Augustin de Urihica along the Suwannee to convert these western Timucua peoples.

In the 18th century, Seminoles lived by the river.

The steamboat &quot;Madison&quot; operated on the river before the Civil War, and the sulphur springs at White Springs became popular as a health resort, with 14 hotels in operation in the late 19th century.

===&quot;Swanee River&quot;===
The Suwanee (given as &quot;Swanee&quot;) is the locale of the protagonist&#x27;s longed-for home in two famous songs: Steven Fosters 1851 &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;, which is commonly called by its first line (&quot;Way down upon the Swanee River&quot;) or just &quot;Swanee River&quot;, and George Gershwin&#x27;s 1919 song &quot;Swanee&quot; (partly inspired by Foster&#x27;s song) made a #1 hit by Al Jolson.

The river thus being internationally famous much beyond other rivers of its size and importance, the Suwanee is presumably the referent in the idiom &quot;go down the swanny&quot; (a variation of &quot;go down the river&quot;), meaning &quot;finished, used up, gone to hell&quot;.

&quot;Swanee whistle&quot;, another name for slide whistle, is also probably based on &quot;swanee&quot; as a variant spelling of &quot;Suwanee&quot;.

==Ecology and biota==
The Suwannee River is a diverse and rich ecological space, hosting varied aquatic and wetland habitats. It is home to a large number of temperate and subtropical species, including unique and endangered ones. The Suwannee alligator snapping turtle, described scientifically only in 2014, is endemic to the Suwannee river basin.

==Recreation==

According to the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, &quot;The Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuge is unlike other refuges in that it was not established for the protection of a specific species, but in order to protect the high water quality of the historic Suwannee River.&quot;

The Suwannee River Wilderness Trail is &quot;a connected web of Florida State Parks, preserves and wilderness areas&quot; that stretches more than 170 miles (274 kilometers), from Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park to the Gulf of Mexico.

The Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuge offers bird and wildlife observation, wildlife photography, fishing, canoeing, hunting, and interpretive walks. Facilities include foot trails, boardwalks, paddling trails, wildlife drives, archaeological sites, observation decks and fishing piers.

<text>Coquet Island is a small island of about , situated off Amble on the Northumberland coast, northeast England. It is included in the civil parish of Hauxley.

==Bird reserve==
The island is owned by the Duke of Northumberland. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds manages the island as a bird reserve, for its important seabird colonies.

The most numerous species is the puffin, with over 18,000 pairs 
nesting in 2002, but the island is most important for the largest colony of the endangered roseate tern in Britain, which, thanks to conservation measures including the provision of nestboxes to protect the nests from gulls and bad weather, has risen to 118 pairs in 2018. Other nesting birds include sandwich tern, common tern, Arctic tern, black-legged kittiwake, fulmar, three other gull species, and eider duck.

The island is uninhabited in winter, but seasonal wardens are present throughout the summer to protect the nesting birds. Landing on Coquet Island for the general public is prohibited, but boats from local companies in Amble sail close up to the island in good weather throughout the summer, allowing visitors to get good views of the puffins and roseate terns.

==Coquet Lighthouse==
Coquet Island was the home at one time of Henry of Coquet (died 1127), a Dane who lived in a hermitage there. The island also holds the remaining structure of a medieval monastery on the southwestern shore, which was largely incorporated into the 19th-century lighthouse and lighthouse keepers&#x27; cottages. 

Coquet Lighthouse was built by Trinity House in 1841 at a cost of £3,268. James Walker designed the lighthouse, which is a white square tower of sandstone, with walls more than one metre thick, surrounded by a turreted parapet. The first keeper at Coquet Lighthouse was William Darling, the elder brother of Grace Darling.
The lighthouse was initially provided with a large (first-order) fixed dioptric along with a set of mirrors (which were replaced with refracting prisms ten years later); the lens was by Isaac Cookson &amp; co. of Newcastle upon Tyne. The lamp was oil-fuelled. 

In 1854 red sectors were added, to warn ships of Hauxley Point to the south and Boulmer Rocks to the north. Later, in 1870, a separate sector light was added, pointing south from a lower window in the tower. In 1891 both lights were made much more powerful; the main lamp was replaced with an eight-wick mineral-oil burner, and its character was changed to occulting (being eclipsed for 2.5 seconds every minute).

An explosive fog signal was established at the lighthouse in 1902, which sounded once every seven-and-a-half minutes; later sounding every three minutes, it was still in use in the 1970s. The light was electrified in 1976; up until this date a paraffin vapour burner provided the main light, and an old-style Argand lamp provided the sector light.

In 1990 the lighthouse was automated, at which point a revolving array of quartz halogen sealed beam lamps were installed in place of the old optic, with columns of lamps grouped in threes on a rotating pedestal, so as to display three flashes every 30 seconds. Subsequently, these were replaced by a small revolving optic, mounted on an AGA PRB gearless drive. Coquet&#x27;s light has been solar powered since 2008.

After its removal from the tower, the original 1841–1851 optic was exhibited (along with the old occulting apparatus) at the Trinity House National Lighthouse Museum in Penzance. After the museum closed they were loaned to Souter Lighthouse where they were displayed for a number of years.

<text>A normal school or normal college is an institution created to train teachers by educating them in the norms of pedagogy and curriculum. Many such schools have since been called teacher training colleges or teachers&#x27; colleges, but in Argentina and Mexico they continue to be called normal schools with student-teachers in the latter country being known as &quot;normalistas&quot;. Many schools require a high school diploma for entry, and may be part of a comprehensive university. Normal schools in the United States, Canada, and Argentina trained teachers for primary schools, while in Europe, the equivalent colleges typically educated teachers for primary schools and later extended their curricula to also cover secondary schools.

In 1685, St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle established the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, founded what is generally considered the first normal school, the &quot;École normale&quot;, in Reims, Champagne, France. The term &quot;normal&quot; in this context refers to the goal of these institutions to instill and reinforce particular &quot;norms&quot; within students. &quot;Norms&quot; included historical behavioral norms of the time, as well as norms that reinforced targeted societal values, ideologies and dominant narratives in the form of curriculum.

The first public normal school in the United States was founded in Concord, Vermont by Samuel Read Hall in 1823 to train teachers. In 1839, the first state-supported normal school was established by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on the northeast corner of the historic Lexington Battle Green; it evolved into Framingham State University. The first modern teacher training school in China was established by educator Sheng Xuanhuai in 1895 as the normal school of the Nanyang Public School (now Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in Shanghai during the Qing dynasty.

Several comprehensive public or state-supported universities—such as UCLA in the United States and Beijing Normal University in China—began as normal schools and later expanded their faculties and programs to become research universities. Some of these universities, particularly in Asia, retain the word &quot;Normal&quot; in their name, highlighting their historical purpose. In Canada, most normal schools were eventually assimilated into a university as its faculty of education, offering a one or two-year Bachelor of Education degree. Such a degree requires at least three, but usually four, years of prior undergraduate study.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;normal school&quot; originated in the early 17th century from the French &quot;école normale&quot;. The French concept of an &quot;école normale&quot; was to provide a model school with model classrooms to teach model teaching practices to its student teachers, and thereby to set the norm for the profession of teaching. The children being taught, their teachers, and the teachers of the teachers were often together in the same building. Although a laboratory school, it was the official school for the children—primary or secondary.. 

Alternatively, the name derives from the objective of the institution to teach the practice or norms of pedagogy, &quot;i.e.&quot;, teaching.

== Europe ==
Educating teachers was of great importance in the newly industrialized European economies which needed a reliable, reproducible and uniform work force. The process of instilling such norms within students depended upon the creation of the first uniform, formalized national educational curriculum. Thus, normal schools, as the teacher training schools, were tasked with both developing this new curriculum and developing the techniques through which teachers would instill these ideas, behaviors and values in the minds of their students.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, schools of education only exist in the state of Baden-Württemberg. These schools prepare teachers for Grundschule (primary school) and secondary schools like Hauptschule and Realschule. Teachers for the Gymnasium are educated at universities.

=== Finland ===
In Finland, normal schools are under national university administration, whereas most schools are administered by the local municipality. Aspirant teachers do most of their compulsory trainee period in normal schools and teach while being supervised by a senior teacher.

=== France ===
In France, a two-tier system developed after the Revolution: primary school teachers were educated at départemental &quot;écoles normales&quot; and high school teachers and university professors at the &quot;écoles normales supérieures&quot;. Nowadays all teachers are educated in an (Graduate School of Teaching and Education). The &quot;écoles normales supérieures&quot; in France now mainly train researchers, who spend one year teaching in &quot;lycée&quot;.

=== Italy ===
In Italy, Normal Schools now are called Liceo delle Scienze Umane. The Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa now focus mainly on training researchers.

=== Lithuania ===
In Lithuania, Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences (LEU), former Vilnius Pedagogical University (VPU) is the main teachers&#x27; training institution, established in 1935.

=== Serbia ===
In Serbia, the first public normal school was founded in Sombor, Vojvodina, by Avram Mrazović in 1778 to train teachers.
In 2018, the Faculty of Education in Sombor celebrated 240 years since the founding of the first school for the education of Serbian teachers called &quot;Norma&quot;. It was a teacher training college at the beginning called &quot;Norma college&quot; before it was closed in 1811, and another school was opened in its place in 1812 in Szentendre under the Declaratory Rescript of the Illyrian Nation. The new institution was named &quot;Regium Pedagogium Nationis Illiricae&quot; or Royal Pedagogium Of The Illyrian-Serbian Nation (also referred to in Latin as &quot;Preparandium&quot; or &quot;Preparadija&quot; in Serbian) which eventually was relocated back to Sombor in 1816. The Normal school – Teachers College is generally considered the first normal school or &quot;École normale&quot; in Sombor. The term &quot;normal&quot; in this case refers to &quot;the goal of the institution to instill and reinforce particular &quot;norms&quot; within students&quot;. Also, these &quot;&quot;norms&quot; included historical behavioral norms of the time, as well as norms that reinforced targeted societal values, ideologies and dominant narratives in the form of curriculum&quot;. For the longest time, this was the only academy for teachers&#x27; training in Serbian. The first woman academician of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Isidora Sekulić, the poet Jovan Dučić, the composers Petar Konjović and Josif Marinković are just some of the &quot;alumni&quot; of &quot;Norma.&quot;

=== Spain ===
In Spain, the first public normal school was the &quot;Escuela Normal de Madrid&quot;, founded in Madrid in 1839. It was gradually integrated into the Complutense University of Madrid&#x27;s Faculty of Education between 1991 and 1995. Later normal schools were founded in Zamora (1841), Segovia (1857), Salamanca and Valladolid.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, teacher training colleges were once named as such, and were independent institutions.

Following the recommendation of the 1963 &quot;Robbins Report&quot; into higher education, teacher training colleges were renamed &quot;Colleges of Education&quot;. Later in the 20th century some became a &quot;College of Higher Education&quot; or an &quot;Institute of Higher Education&quot;. For information about academic divisions devoted to this field outside of the United States and Canada, see Postgraduate Training in Education (disambiguation).

A restructuring of higher education in the UK during the first two decades of the 21st century resulted in some establishments taking the status of &quot;university&quot;. The University of Chester, founded by the Anglican church, traces its roots back to 1839 as the earliest training college in the United Kingdom. Others were also established by religious institutions, and most were single-sex until World War II. Since then, they have either become multi-discipline universities in their own right (e.g. Bishop Grosseteste University; University of Chester; Edge Hill University; St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham; Newman University, Birmingham; Plymouth Marjon University; University of Winchester; University of Worcester; York St John University) or merged with another university to become its faculty of education (e.g. Moray House).

In Wales, there were at least three institutions which included the word &quot;Normal&quot; in their name: Normal School, Brecon, subsequently relocated to become Normal College Swansea (where the academic and mathematician John Viriamu Jones was educated); and Normal College, Bangor (founded 1858), which survived until 1996, when it became part of University of Wales Bangor. The latter was one of the last institutions in the UK to retain the word &quot;Normal&quot; in its name.

== Asia ==

=== China ===

In Mainland China, the &quot;normal school&quot; terminology is still preserved in the official English names of former normal schools established in the late 19th and early 20th century. The Chinese term &quot;normal university&quot; (, abbreviated 师大; &quot;shīdà&quot;) refers to a modern comprehensive university established as a normal school in the early twentieth century. These &quot;normal universities&quot; are usually controlled by the national or provincial government.

In 1895, Qing banking tycoon and educator Sheng Xuanhuai gained approval from the Guangxu Emperor to establish the Nanyang Public School in Shanghai, China. This comprehensive institution included the first normal school on the Chinese mainland. 

In 1923,The Supreme Education School of Peking() has been renamed as National Beijing Normal University(), which is the first Normal University in China&#x27;s history.

Since 1949, many former normal schools in China have developed into comprehensive research universities. As of 2012, Beijing Normal University and East China Normal University, both members of the national government&#x27;s Project 985 program, have been ranked the top two among the mainland Chinese universities that originated as normal schools.

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, there were specialised higher institutions to train teacher by educating them in the norms of pedagogy and curriculum. Indonesian government created crash program around 1950 as B-I/B-II/PGSLP course. In year 1954, the government opened the Teacher Education Higher Education Institutions (, PTPG) in Batusangkar, Manado, Bandung, and Malang by Education and Culture Ministerial Decision No. 382/Kab Year 1954. Both courses were integrated to Teaching and Pedagogy Faculty at nearby university. Government Decision No. 51 Year 1958 integrate Pedagogy Faculty into Teaching and Pedagogy Faculty. In year 1962, Ministry of Basic Education established Teacher Education Institute (, IPG) for middle school teacher. In year 1963, B-I and B-II courses and IPG were merged into Teaching and Pedagogy Faculty under Ministry of Higher Education. In year 1963–1964, Teaching and Pedagogy Faculties were established as separate higher education institutions which were known as Teaching and Education Institutes (, IKIP). Presidential Decision No. 93 Year 1999 allowed IKIP to develop non-educational sciences and marked the end of specialised teacher education higher institutions in general.

=== Japan ===

In Japan, the first normal school () was established at Yushima Seido, Tokyo in 1872. Eventually, prefectural normal schools for primary teachers were established in all prefectures. Japanese-style normal schools were also established in the colonies of Taiwan, Korea, and Manchukuo under Japanese rule.

In 1886, the Normal School Order (師範学校令) was promulgated and the Higher Normal School (高等師範学校) was established in Tokyo to train secondary teachers.

In 1929, Tokyo Arts and Sciences University (Tsukuba University) and Hiroshima Arts and Sciences University (Hiroshima University) were established for Normal School graduates.

During the postwar educational reform, normal schools were reorganized into universities&#x27; education faculties, arts and sciences faculty or universities of education.

=== Malaysia ===

In Malaysia, the Ministry of Education runs a total of 27 Institutes of Teacher Education (ITEs), which were formerly known as Teacher Training Colleges. These ITEs function primarily to educated both undergraduate and postgraduate teacher trainees. The ministry bureau responsible for overseeing them is the Teacher Education Division. The ITEs also run in-service teacher training and continuous professional development among qualified teachers.

=== Philippines ===
In Naga City, the Philippines, one can find the oldest normal school for girls in the Far East, the Universidad de Santa Isabel. It is a sectarian school run by the Daughters of Charity. The first secular normal school was founded in 1901 by the Thomasites, the Philippine Normal School. It was converted into a college in 1949 and was elevated to its present university status in 1992 as the Philippine Normal University. In 2009, it was named National Center of Excellence for Teacher Education by virtue of Republic Act 9647. In Iloilo City, the West Visayas State University was originally established as a normal school in 1902; in 1994, it was recognized by the Philippines government as a Center for Teaching Excellence.

=== Taiwan ===

In Taiwan, three universities served as national normal universities historically. Located in Taipei (National Taiwan Normal University), Changhua (National Changhua University of Education), and Kaohsiung (National Kaohsiung Normal University), the schools primarily cultivates secondary school teachers and also trains teachers for preschool, elementary school, special education and other fields. These schools&#x27; missions have expanded since to make them &quot;de facto&quot; comprehensive research or liberal arts universities.

NCUE didn&#x27;t adopt the term &quot;normal university&quot; because its predecessor was named Taiwan Provincial College of Education, and it was unrelated to the subsequent trend of renaming education universities.

Ten Taiwanese normal schools (, abbreviated 師院; shīyuàn, &quot;normal colleges&quot;) were established under Japanese rule and at the end of World War 2, serving for primary school teacher&#x27;s education. These were promoted as teachers&#x27; colleges and later granted university status in 2000s. It is distinguished under the name &quot;Education University&quot; from the &quot;Normal University&quot;. Some of these were merged with comprehensive university, such as National Hualien University of Education, which were merged with National Dong Hwa University in 2007. Some of them were merged with professional university, such as Taipei Physical Education College was merged with Taipei Municipal University of Education to form the University of Taipei in 2013.

== Oceania ==

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, the term &quot;normal school&quot; can refer to a primary or intermediate school used for teacher training, such as the Epsom Normal Primary School (in Auckland), Kelburn Normal School, Palmerston North Intermediate Normal School, Papakura Normal School, Central Normal School in Palmerston North, and Tahuna Normal Intermediate School and George Street Normal School in Dunedin. They were associated with a teachers&#x27; training college, such as the Auckland College of Education and the Dunedin College of Education, which became colleges of education that trained secondary as well as primary and intermediate school teachers.

Many normal schools were founded in the postrevolutionary period to train the sons and daughters of peasants as teachers. In the 1960s, normal school students joined in the widespread student agitation to create systemic change in Mexico. The 2014 mass kidnapping of normal school students from Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers&#x27; College was a major scandal in Mexico.

====Panama, Colombia and Paraguay====
In Panama, the Escuela Normal Juan Demóstenes Arosemena was founded in Santiago de Veraguas, Panama in 1938. In Colombia, normal schools were primarily associated with women&#x27;s religious schools although in modern times have admitted men, thus forming &quot;escuelas normales mixtas&quot; (mixed normal schools). In Paraguay, they are known as Instituto de Formación Docente.

===United States===


In the United States, the former normal schools that survive in the 21st century have become colleges, usually requiring a high school diploma for entrance. Before the American Civil War public schools were elementary schools, and a normal school provided high school-level instruction as part of preparation for teaching the elementary common schools. Many American universities began as normal schools.

1906 – Eastern Kentucky State Normal School No. 1, Richmond, Kentucky
The same Kentucky law that authorized the state to take over the school now known as Western Kentucky University (see 1876 above) also led to the creation of a second normal school in Richmond. Much like the predecessor to WKU, the Richmond institution, originally known as Eastern Kentucky State Normal School No. 1, took over the campus of an earlier institution, though under somewhat different circumstances. The Eastern Normal School was established in 1906 on the former campus of Central University, an institution that had been founded in 1874 but fell into financial difficulty, and consolidated itself with Centre College in 1901.

A normal school in Murray was created alongside one in Morehead (now Morehead State University). Unlike the three aforementioned schools, the Murray State Normal School was created from scratch, and had no buildings of its own when it began operation. The first classes were held in 1923 at the then-current campus of Murray High School, but the Normal School soon had its own facilities. The Normal School went through several name changes in the following decades—first to Murray State Normal School and Teachers College (1922), Murray State Teachers College (1930), Murray State College (1948), and finally Murray State University (1966).

<doc id="467368" wikidata="Q1415412" url="?curid=467368" title="The Lone Gunmen">
<text>The Lone Gunmen are a trio of fictional characters, Richard &quot;Ringo&quot; Langly, Melvin Frohike and John Fitzgerald Byers, who appeared in recurring roles on the American television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, and who starred in the short-lived spin-off, &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;. Their name was derived from the Warren Commission&#x27;s conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald was solely responsible for the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Described as countercultural patriots, they are ardent conspiracy theorists, government watchdogs and computer hackers who frequently assist central &quot;X-Files&quot; characters Mulder and Scully, though they sometimes have their own adventures. The Lone Gunmen author a news publication called &quot;The Lone Gunman&quot; (once referred to as &quot;The Magic Bullet Newsletter&quot;; a pejorative reference to the single bullet theory and, like the group&#x27;s name, a reference to the John F. Kennedy assassination), to which Mulder loyally subscribed. None of them have day jobs; they rely on financial backers who believe in their cause, and the revenue generated by the subscriptions to their paper. They share a loft apartment where they also work, and use a 1974–79 VW Transporter to commute.

==Characters==
John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood) was once a public relations worker for the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). He was a conservative dresser with a neatly trimmed beard, a stark contrast to his grungier comrades. He had at least some working knowledge of medicine, genetics and chemistry and is known for the famous line, &quot;That&#x27;s why we like you, Mulder. Your ideas are weirder than ours&quot;. He was born on November 22, 1963, the same day that President Kennedy was assassinated, so his parents named him after the fallen president. His name would have been Bertram otherwise. Byers was the most &quot;normal&quot; of the three, and while Frohike and Langly were seemingly born angry misfits, Byers dreamed of a quiet, uneventful, suburban life. Byers&#x27; father was a high-ranking government official, but they never saw eye to eye and when Byers&#x27; father appears in &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot; pilot, the two had not spoken for some time.

Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) was a former 1960s radical and the oldest of the three. Though a skilled computer hacker, Frohike was primarily the photography specialist for the newsletter. Frohike had a lascivious attitude toward women. However, he had a more purely romantic attitude towards Dana Scully; when she was gravely ill in the episode &quot;One Breath&quot;, Frohike appeared at the hospital in a tailored suit carrying a bouquet. His unique sense of fashion made him stand out: leather jackets, black vests, combat boots, fingerless gloves, etc. Frohike considered himself the &quot;action man&quot; of the trio and would often be seen doing very intense stunts (many rigged to look more impressive than they really were). Despite his childish scraps with Langly and others, Frohike&#x27;s age and experience gave him a kind of quiet wisdom that occasionally surfaced when he consoled his friends about the sorry nature of their lives. In &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot; episode &quot;Tango de los Pistoleros&quot;, Frohike was revealed to be a former tango champion who danced under the stage name &quot;El Lobo&quot;.

Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) was the most confrontational and youngest of the three. He was a big fan of the Ramones, he enjoyed critiquing the scientific inaccuracies of the short-lived sci-fi series &quot;Earth 2&quot;, and he had a long-running competition with Frohike over who was a better computer hacker. He also had &quot;a philosophical aversion to having his image bounced off a satellite&quot;. His nickname was &quot;Ringo&quot;. Langly was a Dungeons &amp; Dragons player (as &quot;Lord Manhammer&quot;) and enjoyed video games like &quot;Quake&quot;. In the &quot;Lone Gunmen&quot; episode &quot;Like Water for Octane&quot;, it is revealed that Langly is a &quot;32-year-old virgin&quot;. At some point during his life he uploaded a part of his mind into a computer server, which activated when he died. In the 2018 &quot;X-Files&quot; episode &quot;This&quot;, the part of his mind he had uploaded contacted Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, and told them to destroy the server. When they did, it was revealed he was still &quot;alive&quot; in the backup he created.

===Associates===

Fox Mulder (David Duchovny): an FBI Special agent who was in charge of The X-Files. Mulder first met the trio when they first formed, and they would prove to be his longtime allies and friends. He turned to The Lone Gunmen numerous times when needing information on elements of the paranormal or when he needed to access highly guarded government institutions. After he disappeared from the FBI, his X-Files partner Dana Scully, his boss Walter Skinner, and his replacements John Doggett and Monica Reyes would ask for the assistance of The Lone Gunmen as well. When Mulder was supposedly found &quot;dead&quot;, The Gunmen appeared at his funeral, but when he proved to be alive, they were the ones who tearfully welcomed him back. Mulder was not able to attend the funeral of The Lone Gunmen, as he was still in hiding, but he talked to their apparitions following his resurfacing. Scully, Skinner, Doggett, and Reyes would attend their funeral, and Scully proclaimed that The Lone Gunmen &quot;meant so much to [her]&quot;.

Kenneth Soona aka The Thinker (Bernie Coulson): an unofficial fourth member, a computer hacker, who succeeded in accessing Majestic 12 files and encrypting them onto a digital tape in the season 2 finale of the &quot;X-Files&quot; titled &quot;Anasazi&quot;. The Thinker first appeared in the season 2 episode titled &quot;One Breath&quot;. The Thinker was killed by assassins working for the Cigarette Smoking Man, who eventually re-acquired the tape. He was referred to in the first episode of season 3 titled &quot;The Blessing Way&quot; as being murdered, but he was not in that episode.

Jimmy Bond (Stephen Snedden): another &quot;fourth member&quot;, who joined the trio in &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot; series. Though he shares the bravery and physicality of his namesake, he initially appears to be rich but not very bright, and is fascinated with the trio, who often consider him a nuisance. His saving grace is his boundless optimism, coupled with an idealistic view that the jaded Gunmen wish they still held.

Yves Adele Harlow (Zuleikha Robinson): a pseudonymous femme fatale who sometimes works with the Lone Gunmen (though she&#x27;s sometimes at odds with them, as her goals are rarely as selfless as theirs) and often employs various disguises. Her alias is an anagram for Lee Harvey Oswald. Her real name is Lois Runce, and she is the daughter of an arms dealer. Jimmy Bond is emotionally attached to her, although his feelings are unrequited.

Kimmy the Geek (Jim Fyfe): an expert hacker and a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan who occasionally helps the trio. He is the twin brother of Jimmy the Geek, a character killed by a bus in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Three of a Kind&quot;, played by the same actor.

Susanne Modeski (Signy Coleman): an employee at the Advanced Weapon Research Centre at White Stone Army Base in New Mexico in 1989, who assisted in the development of a biological weapon that creates psychotic hallucinations. After she turned against their employers, she enlisted the help of Byers (then an employee of the FCC), Frohike and Langley (then both freelance hackers, selling bootleg cable hardware) in order to uncover the truth. Though she was unsuccessful in bringing her story to the public, and was abducted by the mysterious government operative known as X shortly thereafter, she was unwittingly responsible for the formation of the group as investigative journalists and their first introduction to Mulder. A decade later, Byers (who harbored feelings for Susanne) encountered her in Las Vegas, where he and the others helped her assume a new identity. Modeski appears in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episodes &quot;Unusual Suspects&quot; and &quot;Three of a Kind&quot;.

==Origins==
In the &quot;X-Files&quot; season 5 episode &quot;Unusual Suspects&quot;, it is revealed how the Gunmen initially got together.

In 1989, John Byers meets a woman named Holly in an electronics expo. Holly claims that her ex-boyfriend (Mulder) is stalking her and has kidnapped her daughter. She gives Byers an internet address which is supposed to locate her daughter. The file is encrypted, so Byers enlists the aid of computer hacker/cable salesman Melvin Frohike. Frohike decrypts the file, but when they confront Mulder, they discover he is an FBI agent (who has not yet been assigned to the X-Files). Suspicious, Byers and Frohike get Richard Langly to hack into the FBI network. They discover that Holly&#x27;s real name is Susanne Modeski, and she is wanted for bombing an FBI lab. The three confront Modeski, and she admits that she works for the Army Advanced Weapons facility at Whitestone, NM. She has developed a gas that causes fear and paranoia, and the military plans to test it on civilians. She then enlists the help of the three to stop the government&#x27;s plan. They track the material to a warehouse, where the gas is in a shipment of asthma inhalers. Mulder follows them and is about to arrest them when all five of them are ambushed by two hitmen sent to kill Modeski. A shootout ensues, and Mulder takes cover.

Modeski kills the hitmen as they are about to execute Mulder and promptly flees. A team led by X sanitizes the scene, cautioning the guys to stay out of trouble. The trio got their name as a result of Byers confronting X at this point about the assassination of John F. Kennedy. X&#x27;s cynical reply was, &quot;I heard that it was a lone gunman.&quot;

The police arrive soon after. All three of the Gunmen are arrested, and Byers recounts his story to Detective John Munch. Munch is skeptical, but Mulder verifies the story, so the guys are released. They find Modeski, and she implores them to tell as many people as they can about the government conspiracy. Without warning, a black rental car pulls up, and the occupants force Modeski inside. Later, the guys are visited by Mulder, who says that he has weird ideas in his head that he cannot seem to shake.

==&quot;X-Files&quot; appearances==
Despite only minor appearances in early &quot;X-Files&quot; episodes, the Gunmen became fan favorites, getting their own T-shirts. They also appeared prominently in episodes written by acclaimed science fiction authors William Gibson and Tom Maddox.

Since becoming &quot;X-Files&quot; mainstays, Gunmen-styled technogeeks have appeared on other television series, such as Brian Roedecker on &quot;Millennium&quot; and Abby Sciuto on &quot;NCIS&quot;. Similar characters have appeared in many genre series: the Trio, a group of geeky would-be villains in season six of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and a pair of nerdy &quot;paranormal investigator&quot; bloggers who appear in the first season &quot;Hell House&quot; and third-season episode &quot;Ghostfacers!&quot; of the show &quot;Supernatural&quot;, while &quot;Invasion&quot; featured Dave, a rather Frohike-esque blogger journalist who was determined to bring the truth about alien &quot;hybrids&quot; to the world. On the FX series &quot;Terriers&quot;, the main characters repeatedly utilized the services of a tech-savvy trio who operated out of an RV and were especially skilled in surveillance and computer hacking.

One or all of the Gunmen appeared in the following &quot;X-Files&quot; episodes, as well as all episodes of &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;. All three characters died in the &quot;X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Jump the Shark&quot;, which aired the year after &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot; series was cancelled.

==&quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot; series==
The Lone Gunmen, a spin-off of the popular series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, is a television show that aired on the Fox network, featuring the characters of the same name. The show first aired in March 2001 and, despite good reviews, was canceled due to a drop in ratings. The last episode aired in June 2001.

The debut of the show involved Byers&#x27; father faking his death to uncover a conspiracy to hijack an airliner and fly it into the world trade center. The Lone Gunmen try to get to the truth of his supposed death and uncover the conspiracy.

One retrospectively relevant aspect of this pilot episode is that the airliner has been hijacked (via remote control of the plane&#x27;s autopilot) and, by the end, both Byers and his father have boarded the plane to try to stop the hijacking. Through the aid of the other Gunmen, they are able to regain control of the plane and just miss crashing into the World Trade Center with the airliner. This episode aired about six months before the actual September 11 attacks against the World Trade Center later that year.

Their spin-off series involved investigating mostly corporate crime, aided (and sometimes hindered) by a mysterious thief named Yves Adele Harlow (Zuleikha Robinson). Despite fan loyalty, the show was ultimately canceled after 13 episodes. They return to &quot;The X-Files&quot; in the episode &quot;Jump the Shark&quot; in the show&#x27;s ninth season where they were exposed to a deadly biological agent and ultimately died. They briefly reappeared in the season nine finale of &quot;The X-Files&quot; as Mulder spoke to their ghosts (this episode stood as the series finale for 14 years until season ten aired in 2016).

Frank Spotnitz confirmed that had The Lone Gunmen returned for a second season, the character of Morris Fletcher (played by Michael McKean) was to have become a regular one, either assisting or antagonising (or possibly both) the three main protagonists.

==&quot;The X-Files: Season 10&quot; (ongoing comic series)==
In the second issue of the ongoing comic book Season 10, ex-FBI agent Fox Mulder is investigating the disappearances of Dana Scully and John Doggett and receives a tip from someone with the initials &quot;TLG&quot;. This leads Mulder to dig up the graves of The Lone Gunmen in Arlington National Cemetery to which, despite initially surprising Fox while masquerading as the cemetery&#x27;s security, he is confronted by the alive and breathing Frohike. A descending staircase is unearthed beneath one of the caskets and Mulder is reunited with the rest of the trio. Their deaths in &quot;Jump the Shark&quot; being faked so they could continue their operations more discreetly, TLG are ready to jump into action when Mulder tells them he needs help pinpointing information on the Van de Kamps in order to move forward in the search for Scully and Doggett.

A few questions are on Mulder&#x27;s mind however – although he&#x27;s first told that their hand in the creation of the Stuxnet virus for the U.S. military in 2010 is what allows them to continue to fly under the radar, what Fox really wants to ask them is &quot;how&#x27;d you boys know I was coming again?&quot; The comic ends with a shadowy, silhouetted figure standing alone in the cemetery, just having dumped an empty pack of Morley cigarettes behind him.

It is often called the original Universal Japanese Motorcycle (UJM) and also is regarded as the first motorcycle to be called a &quot;superbike&quot;.

The CR750 is the associated works racer.

Though other manufacturers had marketed the transverse, overhead camshaft, inline four-cylinder engine configuration and the layout had been used in racing engines prior to World War II, Honda popularized the configuration with the CB750, and the layout subsequently became the dominant sport bike engine layout.

The CB750 is included in the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame Classic Bikes; was named in the Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Motorbikes Ever&quot;; was in &quot;The Art of the Motorcycle&quot; exhibition, and is in the UK National Motor Museum. The Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc. rates the 1969 CB750 as one of the &quot;240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology&quot;.

Although the CB750 nameplate has carried on throughout multiple generations, the original CB750 line from 1969 to 1983 was succeeded by the CBX750, which used the CB750 designation for several of its derivatives.

==History==
Honda of Japan introduced the CB750 motorcycle to the US and European markets in 1969 after experiencing success with its smaller motorcycles. In the late 1960s Honda motorcycles were, overall, the world&#x27;s biggest sellers. There were the C100 Cub step-through—the best-selling motorcycle of all time—the C71, C72, C77 and CA77/8 Dreams; and the CB72/77 Super Hawks/Sports. A taste of what was ahead came with the introduction of the revolutionary CB450 DOHC twin-cylinder machine in 1966. Profits from these production bikes financed the successful racing machines of the 1960s, and lessons learned from racing were applied to the CB750. The CB750 was targeted directly at the US market after Honda officials, including founder Soichiro Honda, repeatedly met US dealers and understood the opportunity for a larger bike.

===Early racing===
In 1967 American Honda&#x27;s service manager Bob Hansen flew to Japan and discussed with Soichiro Honda the possibility of using Grand Prix technology in bikes prepared for American motorcycle events. American racing&#x27;s governing body, the AMA, had rules that allowed racing by production machines only, and restricted overhead-valve engines to 500 cc whilst allowing the side-valve Harley Davidsons to compete with 750 cc engines. Honda knew that what won on the race track today, sold in the show rooms tomorrow, and a large engine capacity road machine would have to be built to compete with the Harley Davidson and Triumph twin-cylinder machines.

Hansen told Soichiro Honda that he should build a &#x27;King of Motorcycles&#x27;, and the CB750 appeared at the Tokyo Show in November 1968. In the UK, it was publicly launched at the Brighton motorcycle show, held at the Metropole Hotel exhibition centre during April 1969, with an earlier press-launch at Honda&#x27;s London headquarters; the pre-production versions appeared with a high and very wide handlebar intended for the US market.

The AMA Competition Committee recognised the need for more variation of racing motorcycle and changed the rules from 1970, by standardizing a full 750 cc displacement for all engines regardless of valve location or number of cylinders, enabling Triumph and BSA to field their 750 cc triples instead of the 500 cc Triumph Daytona twins.
The Honda factory responded by producing four works-racer CR750s, a racing version of the production CB750, ridden by UK-based Ralph Bryans, Tommy Robb and Bill Smith under the supervision of Mr Nakamura, and a fourth machine under Hansen ridden by Dick Mann. The three Japanese-prepared machines all failed during the race with Mann just holding on to win by a few seconds with a failing engine.

Hansen&#x27;s race team&#x27;s historic victory at the March 1970 Daytona 200 with Dick Mann riding a tall-geared CR750 to victory preceded the June 1970 Isle of Man TT races when two &#x27;official&#x27; Honda CB750s were entered, again ridden by Irishman Tommy Robb partnered in the team by experienced English racer John Cooper. The machines were entered into the 750 cc Production Class, a category for road-based machines allowing a limited number of strictly-controlled modifications. They finished in eighth and ninth places. Cooper was interviewed in UK monthly magazine &quot;Motorcycle Mechanics&quot;, stating both riders were unhappy with their poor-handling Hondas, and that he would not ride in the next year&#x27;s race &quot;unless the bikes have been greatly improved&quot;.

In 1973, Japanese rider Morio Sumiya finished in sixth place in the Daytona 200-Mile race on a factory 750.

== Production and reception ==

Under development for a year, the CB750 had a transverse straight-four engine with a single overhead camshaft (SOHC) and a front disc brake, neither of which had previously been available on an affordable mainstream production motorcycle. This spec, married with the introductory price of US$ (US$ in current money), gave the CB750 a considerable sporting-performance advantage over its competition, particularly its British rivals.

&quot;Cycle&quot; magazine called the CB750, &quot;the most sophisticated production bike ever&quot; at the time of the bike&#x27;s introduction. &quot;Cycle World&quot; called it a masterpiece, highlighting Honda&#x27;s painstaking durability testing, the bike&#x27;s top speed, the fade-free braking, the comfortable ride, and the excellent instrumentation.

The CB750 was the first modern four-cylinder machine from a mainstream manufacturer, and the term &quot;superbike&quot; was coined to describe it. Adding to the bike&#x27;s value were its electric starter, kill switch, dual mirrors, flashing turn signals, easily maintained valves, and overall smoothness and low vibration both under way and at a standstill. Much later models from 1991 included maintenance-free hydraulic valves.

Unsure of the bike&#x27;s reception and therefore unable to accurately gauge demand for the new bike, Honda limited its initial investment in the production dies for the CB750&#x27;s engine by using a technique called permanent mould casting (often erroneously referred to as sandcasting), rather than diecasting. The bike remained in the Honda line up for ten years, with a production total over 400,000.

===CB750A Hondamatic===

In 1976, Honda introduced the CB750A to the United States, with the &quot;A&quot; suffix designating &quot;Automatic&quot;, for its automatic transmission. Although the two-speed transmission includes a torque converter typical of an automatic transmission, the transmission does not automatically change gears for the rider. Each gear is selected by a foot-controlled hydraulic valve/selector (similar in operation to a manual transmission motorcycle). The foot selector controls the application of high pressure oil to a single clutch pack (one clutch for each gear), causing the selected clutch (and gear) to engage. The selected gear remains selected until changed by the rider, or the kickstand is lowered (which shifts the transmission to neutral).

The CB750A was sold in the North American and Japanese markets only. The name Hondamatic was shared with Honda cars of the 1970s, but the motorcycle transmission was not fully automatic. The design of the transmission is similar in concept to the transmission in Honda&#x27;s N360AT, a kei car sold in Japan from 1967 to 1972.

The CB750A uses the same engine as the CB750, but detuned with lower 7.7:1 compression and smaller carburettors producing a lower output, . The same oil is used for the engine and transmission, and the engine was changed to a wet sump instead of dry sump type. A lockout safety device prevents the transmission from moving out of neutral if the side stand is down. There is no tachometer but the instruments include a fuel gauge and gear indicator. For 1977 the gearing was revised, and the exhaust changed to a four-into-two with a silencer on either side. Due to slow sales the model was discontinued in 1978, though Honda did later introduce smaller Hondamatic motorcycles (namely the CB400A, CM400A, and CM450A). &quot;Cycle World&quot; tested the 1976 CB750A&#x27;s top speed at , with a time of 10.0 seconds and a standing time of 15.90 seconds at . Braking from was .
===Nighthawk 750 &amp; CBX750 derived CB750 Models===
From 1982 through 2003, with the exception of several years, Honda produced a CB750 known as the Nighthawk 750. As the motorcycle market in the early 1980s began to experience segmentation and the prevalence of UJMs began to dwindle, Honda made efforts to hold its territory on the market by offering more specific variants of their existing bikes as the company was still in the midst of researching and developing dedicated sportbike and cruiser lines. The cruiser variant of many of the Honda models offered at the time would be known as &quot;customs&quot;; this included but was not limited to the CB900C, CX500C, CM250C and the CB750C, and these bikes would prove to be the most popular with American consumers. Therefore, expanding upon the niche that the CB750C &quot;Custom&quot; had initiated along with its &quot;custom&quot; stable mates, a new series of bikes appeared with the surname &quot;Nighthawk&quot;. These bikes would continue to take on the &#x27;pseudo&#x27; cruiser bike aesthetic that was specifically catered for the North American market at the time along with offering certain upmarket features, one notable feature being hydraulic valves. Along with the normal CB750 1982-1983 variants the CB750SC Nighthawk would be offered. The Nighthawk 750SC had a 749cc 4-stroke engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, chain drive, front disc and rear drum brakes. Also exclusive to the Nighthawk variant was Honda&#x27;s TRAC (Torque Reactive Anti-Dive System). Because of the 1983 motorcycle tariff, the Nighthawk CB750SC was soon replaced by the smaller, yet more sporty and sophisticated CB700SC Nighthawk S. This new motorcycle was a downsized version of the CB750SC Nighthawk S, the export variant of the CB750&#x27;s successor, the CBX750
After the discontinuation of the CB700SC Nighthawk S in 1986 and the tariff being lifted in 1987 Honda decided not to follow up with the larger CB750SC Nighthawk S, which was offered for the Canadian market. Instead, as was typically the case for many Japanese corporations during the bubble years, Honda began to experiment with its standard bike offerings by first releasing the V-twin NT650 in 1988 and later both the boutique-developed cafe racer GB500 and CBR400RR derived CB-1 in 1989. Though innovative in their own right, these motorcycles had very short lives in the North American Market; soon growing demand emerged for a return towards the traditional UJM style that had fallen out of prominence due to market segmentation. Also in 1989, Kawasaki had successfully released the Zephyr 400 in the Japanese market and soon 550cc and 750cc versions would debut for export markets as well, which was an indicator that a return to form was needed in order to meet demand both at home and abroad. 

Honda responded in the summer of 1991 with the RC38 Nighthawk 750, which was marketed in both North America and Japan, though for the latter only for a single year as the RC39 CB750 Nighthawk. The following year, the higher spec RC42 CB750 would debut for Europe and Japanese markets (in Europe it went by either CB750F2 or &quot;CB&quot; &quot;Seven-Fifty&quot;). Both the RC38/39 and RC42 were parts-bin specials, mainly being mechanical descendants of the CBX750 yet also borrowing numerous components from other bikes such as the CBR600F2, Goldwing and CB-1.

The RC38/39 Nighthawk 750 differed from the RC42 CB750 by taking on a more budget-friendly, cruiser-adjacent approach with its packaging; instead of the CB750&#x27;s dual front disc and single rear disc brake setup, the Nighthawk 750 instead made use with a single disc brake on a larger front 18&quot; wheel and a rear drum brake. The fork rake angle on the Nighthawk 750 was slightly increased and conventional twin hydraulic shock absorbers were used instead of the CB750&#x27;s gas-charged absorbers; the Nighthawk&#x27;s foot rest were welded to the frame, rather than being interchangeable like on the CB750 and the styling for the Nighthawk was given a more &#x27;retro&#x27;, smoother reworking that was reminiscent of the Nighthawk bikes of the early 1980s. The engine, exhaust, transmission, gearing and gauges were the same on both bikes.

The RC42 CB750 was widely adopted at riding schools throughout Japan to prepare riders for their large motorcycle license exams due in part to its smooth power delivery, predictable handling, neutral ergonomics, reliability and maintainability.

The entry-level 1992-2008 Nighthawk 250 was derived from the Nighthawk 750.

==== 2007 CB750 Special Edition ====

In 2007 Honda Japan announced the CB750 Special Edition. This limited edition run was put forth to commemorate the 25th anniversary of &quot;Fast Freddie&quot; Spencer joining the Honda Grand Prix Team and a version of this bike donning the &quot;Digital Silver Metallic&quot; color of the CB750 racebike Spencer used in the 1981 AMA Superbike championship was offered alongside a version that was painted in &quot;Candy Blazing Red&quot; reminiscent of the CBX1000.

=== Discontinuation and Successors ===
The CB750F2/&quot;CB Seven-Fifty&quot; was discontinued for the European market in 2001 and in 2003 the Nighthawk 750 was discontinued in North America, though the CB750 would continue in Japan until 2008 when 2007 automobile exhaust gas regulations went into effect. This would lead the CBR-based Honda Hornet CB600F and later NC700 series to eventually take over the role as Honda&#x27;s middleweight standard bike offerings in both Europe and North America.

In 2010, Honda released the CB1100, which although well over 750cc in displacement and fuel-injected was marketed as a spiritual successor to the CB750, both in style and in concept; this motorcycle would be later sold to Europe and North America from 2013 until 2022.

==== 2023 CB750 Hornet ====
In 2023, Honda Motor Europe Ltd revived the CB750 nameplate once more in the form of the CB750 Hornet. This new model, though sharing the same name, takes a major departure from the established layout that previous CB750s possessed, namely in regards to its engine configuration and fuel injection system. The frame and engine of the motorcycle is lifted directly from new XL750 Transalp; the new engine being a 755cc DOHC 8-valve liquid-cooled parallel twin with an output of 90.5 hp @ 9,500 rpm and 55.3 lb.-ft. @ 7,250 rpm. It is also the first CB750 to use Honda&#x27;s PGM-FI fuel system. The CB750 Hornet is currently sold for European, Australia, India and Southeast Asian markets.

<doc id="467383" wikidata="Q240485" url="?curid=467383" title="Kerry Katona">
<text>Kerry Katona (born 6 September 1980) is an English television personality and former singer. She was an original member of the pop girl group Atomic Kitten between 1998 and 2001, leaving before the group&#x27;s success. Katona has appeared on various reality television shows, including &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here&quot; (2004), &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; (2011), &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; (2011), and &quot;Celebs on the Farm&quot; (2021), as well as her own documentary series about her life on MTV UK.

==Early life==
Katona was born on 6 September 1980 in Warrington, Cheshire. Katona&#x27;s maternal grandfather is Hungarian who fled Budapest to London during the Second World War. As a child she was placed in care and brought up by four sets of foster parents and attended eight different schools. She left school aged 16 and become a lap dancer, touring Europe. She posed topless for Page 3 in &quot;The Sun&quot; at the age of 17 and posed for the men&#x27;s publication &quot;Zoo&quot;. She also worked as a glamour model, appearing in publications like &quot;New!&quot;, &quot;Now&quot;, and &quot;Star&quot;.

==Career==
===1998–2001: Atomic Kitten===
In 1998, Katona auditioned for a new girl group created by OMD frontman Andy McCluskey and was chosen, along with Liz McClarnon and Heidi Range – replaced by Natasha Hamilton in 1999. The group became Atomic Kitten and their debut single, &quot;Right Now&quot;, was released on 29 November 1999, reaching number 10 in UK. Following this initial success, the group released three more singles that failed to reach the top 5 and a debut album that peaked at number 29. Atomic Kitten&#x27;s record label, Innocent Records, was considering dropping them because of their limited success, but were persuaded to allow the group to release &quot;Whole Again&quot; on 29 January 2001. Katona shot the music video, but left the group two days before release because of an unexpected pregnancy and conflicts with the other girls.

She was quickly replaced by former Precious singer Jenny Frost and their debut album was re-released with the new vocalist. With Frost, &quot;Whole Again&quot; reached number one in 18 other countries, and the group had four number one singles in UK, two number one albums and estimated sales of 10 million records.

===2002–2012: Reality shows===
In 2002, Katona presented the ITV&#x27;s dating show &quot;ElimiDate&quot; and appeared on &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;. In 2004, she won the third series of the British reality TV show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. She also appeared as judge on the RTÉ talent show &quot;You&#x27;re a Star&quot;. In 2005 Katona starred her own reality show, &quot;My Fair Kerry&quot;, on ITV. From 2007 to 2010, she starred more five reality shows on MTV UK about her life, rehab and bipolar disorder: &quot;Kerry Katona: Crazy in Love&quot; (2007), &quot;Kerry Katona: Whole Again&quot; (2008), &quot;Kerry Katona: What&#x27;s The Problem?&quot; (2009), &quot;Kerry Katona: Coming Clean&quot; (2010) and &quot;Kerry Katona: The Next Chapter&quot; (2010). In 2009, she also attempted to become a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 7&quot; but she failed the required psychological tests.

In 2011 she was a contestant on &quot;Dancing on Ice Series 6&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 8&quot;, reaching the second place.

===2013–present: Atomic Kitten return and new reality shows===
In 2013 Katona reunited with Liz McClarnon and Natasha Hamilton to reform Atomic Kitten for the reality show &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, along with five other pop groups of their time – 911, Honeyz, B*Witched, Five and Liberty X. After the show, they officially returned and toured for four years. In 2017 Katona left the group again when she drank and hit Hamilton after a performance in Australia. In 2019, Katona appeared in the sixth series of E4 reality series &quot;Celebs Go Dating&quot;.

In 2021, Katona starred more reality shows, including &quot;Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins&quot;, &quot;Fame in the Family&quot;, &quot;Celeb Cooking School&quot; and &quot;Celebs on the Farm&quot;, which she won. In 2022, she became co-host of the &quot;Wheel of Misfortune&quot; podcast alongside comedian Alison Spittle.

==Personal life==
From 2002 to 2004 Katona was married to singer Brian McFadden and they had two daughters. In 2005 she started dating taxi driver Mark Croft, whom she married on 14 February 2007 and had two children. In her autobiography, &quot;Still Standing&quot;, Katona said she met Croft when she was supplying cocaine to her mother. They divorced in 2011. On 14 September 2014 Katona married former rugby league player George Kay and had her fifth child. On 7 October 2015, Katona announced their separation after he allegedly assaulted her at their home in Crowborough and was subsequently arrested by police. Kay died on 5 July 2019 after an overdose.

===Health and drugs abuse===
Since 2004, Katona has been in rehab many times for cocaine and alcohol abuse, according to her autobiography, &quot;Still Standing&quot;. In 2009, Iceland Foods and Asda supermarkets broke a long-standing €290,000 advertising campaigns deal with Katona after photographs appeared in the tabloids, allegedly showing her taking cocaine in a bathroom.

Like her mother Sue, Katona was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2005. On 19 July 2007 Katona was admitted to the Priory Hospital with a mental health crisis. Katona also has dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Katona is a patron of The Shannon Bradshaw Trust, a Warrington-based charity which helps children with life-threatening conditions.

===Legal issues===
On 15 July 2007, Katona, Croft, and their infant daughter Heidi were held hostage, when three men forcibly entered their home in Wilmslow, one of them holding Katona at knife-point while the others forced Croft to show them where valuables were kept. Nobody was physically harmed, but the men left with a blue BMW and other valuables with an estimated total value between £100,000 and £150,000. On 21 August 2008, Katona was declared bankrupt at the High Court in London after failing to pay the final £82,000 of a £417,000 tax bill. On 2 July 2013, Katona filed for bankruptcy again at County Court in Wigan.

On 8 May 2019, Brighton Magistrates&#x27; Court ordered Katona to pay a £500 fine after the school attendance rate of one of her children had fallen below 50% in 2018, but her solicitor argued that Katona did not have childcare and had to take the child to work with her.

<doc id="467384" wikidata="Q2278680" url="?curid=467384" title="Shift operator">
<text>In mathematics, and in particular functional analysis, the shift operator, also known as the translation operator, is an operator that takes a function 
to its translation . In time series analysis, the shift operator is called the &quot;lag operator&quot;.

Shift operators are examples of linear operators, important for their simplicity and natural occurrence. The shift operator action on functions of a real variable plays an important role in harmonic analysis, for example, it appears in the definitions of almost periodic functions, positive-definite functions, derivatives, and convolution. Shifts of sequences (functions of an integer variable) appear in diverse areas such as Hardy spaces, the theory of abelian varieties, and the theory of symbolic dynamics, for which the baker&#x27;s map is an explicit representation. The notion of triangulated category is a categorified analogue of the shift operator.

==Definition==

===Functions of a real variable===

The shift operator (where ) takes a function on to its translation , 
: formula_1

A practical operational calculus representation of the linear operator in terms of the plain derivative was introduced by Lagrange,

~, &lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}

which may be interpreted operationally through its formal Taylor expansion in ; and whose action on the monomial is evident by the binomial theorem, and hence on &quot;all series in&quot; , and so all functions as above. This, then, is a formal encoding of the Taylor expansion in Heaviside&#x27;s calculus.

The operator thus provides the prototype 
for Lie&#x27;s celebrated advective flow for Abelian groups,
:formula_2
where the canonical coordinates (Abel functions) are defined such that 
:formula_3

For example, it easily follows that formula_4 yields scaling,
:formula_5
hence formula_6 (parity); likewise, 
formula_7 yields 
:formula_8

formula_9 yields 
:formula_10

formula_11 yields 
:formula_12
etc.

The initial condition of the flow and the group property completely determine the entire Lie flow, providing a solution to the translation functional equation
:formula_13

===Sequences===

The left shift operator acts on one-sided infinite sequence of numbers by

:formula_14

and on two-sided infinite sequences by

:formula_15

The right shift operator acts on one-sided infinite sequence of numbers by

:formula_16

and on two-sided infinite sequences by

:formula_17

The right and left shift operators acting on two-sided infinite sequences are called bilateral shifts.

===Abelian groups===

In general, as illustrated above, if is a function on an abelian group , and is an element of , the shift operator maps to
:formula_18

==Properties of the shift operator==

The shift operator acting on real- or complex-valued functions or sequences is a linear operator which preserves most of the standard norms which appear in functional analysis. Therefore, it is usually a continuous operator with norm one.

===Action on Hilbert spaces===

The shift operator acting on two-sided sequences is a unitary operator on The shift operator acting on functions of a real variable is a unitary operator on 

In both cases, the (left) shift operator satisfies the following commutation relation with the Fourier transform:
formula_19
where is the multiplication operator by . Therefore, the spectrum of is the unit circle.

The one-sided shift acting on is a proper isometry with range equal to all vectors which vanish in the first coordinate. The operator is a compression of , in the sense that
formula_20
where is the vector in with for and for . This observation is at the heart of the construction of many unitary dilations of isometries.

The spectrum of is the unit disk. The shift is one example of a Fredholm operator; it has Fredholm index −1.

==Generalization==

Jean Delsarte introduced the notion of generalized shift operator (also called generalized displacement operator); it was further developed by Boris Levitan.

A family of operators acting on a space of functions from a set to is called a family of generalized shift operators if the following properties hold:
# Associativity: let formula_21 Then formula_22
# There exists in such that is the identity operator.
In this case, the set is called a hypergroup.

<doc id="467386" wikidata="Q1792726" url="?curid=467386" title="The Moon and Sixpence">
<text>The Moon and Sixpence is a novel by W. Somerset Maugham, first published on 15 April 1919. It is told in episodic form by a first-person narrator providing a series of glimpses into the mind and soul of the central character, Charles Strickland, a middle-aged English stockbroker, who abandons his wife and children abruptly to pursue his desire to become an artist. The story is, in part, based on the life of the painter Paul Gauguin.

==Plot summary==
The book is written largely from the point of view of the narrator, a young, aspiring writer and playwright in London. Certain chapters entirely comprise accounts of events by other characters, which the narrator recalls from memory, selectively editing or elaborating on certain aspects of dialogue, particularly Strickland&#x27;s, because Strickland is said by the narrator to have a very poor ability to express himself in words. The narrator first develops an acquaintance with Strickland&#x27;s wife at literary parties and later meets Strickland himself, who appears to be an unremarkable businessman with no interest in his wife&#x27;s literary or artistic tastes.

Strickland is a well-off, middle-class stockbroker in London, sometime in the late 19th or early 20th century. Early in the novel, he leaves his wife and children and goes to Paris. The narrator enters directly into the story at that point, when he is asked by Mrs Strickland to go to Paris and talk with her husband. He lives a destitute but defiantly contented life there as a painter, lodging in run-down hotels and falling prey to both illness and hunger. Strickland, in his drive to express through his art what appears to continually possess and compel him on the inside, cares nothing for physical discomfort and is indifferent to his surroundings. He is helped and supported by a commercially successful but hackneyed Dutch painter, Dirk Stroeve, coincidentally, also an old friend of the narrator, who recognises Strickland&#x27;s genius as a painter. After helping Strickland recover from a life-threatening illness, Stroeve is repaid by having his wife, Blanche, abandon him for Strickland. Strickland later discards the wife, because all he really wanted from Blanche was for her to be a model to paint, not a serious companion. It is hinted in the novel that he indicated that to her, but she took the risk anyway. Blanche then dies by suicide. She is another human casualty in Strickland&#x27;s single-minded pursuit of art and beauty, the first casualties being his own established life, and those of his wife and children.

After the Paris episode, the story continues in Tahiti. Strickland has already died, and the narrator attempts to piece together his life there from recollections of others. He finds that Strickland had taken up with a native woman, had two children by her (one of whom died), and started painting prolifically. We learn that Strickland had settled for a short while in the French port of Marseille before traveling to Tahiti, where he lived for a few years before dying of leprosy. Strickland left behind numerous paintings, but his magnum opus, which he painted on the walls of his hut before losing his sight to leprosy, was burnt by his wife after his death, as per his dying orders.

==Inspiration==
The life of the French artist Paul Gauguin is the inspiration for the story, but the character of Strickland as a solitary, sociopathic, and destructive genius is more related to a mythological version of Gauguin&#x27;s life, which the artist himself developed and promoted, than the actual course of his life. The real Gauguin was a participant in the artistic developments in France in the 1880s, exhibiting his work regularly with the Impressionists, and being a friend and collaborator with many artists. Gauguin did work as a stockbroker, did leave his wife and family to devote his life to art, and did leave Europe for Tahiti to pursue his career. However, none of that happened in the brutal way of the novel&#x27;s character. Maugham took inspiration from the published writings about Gauguin available at the time, as well as personal experience living among the artistic community in Paris in 1904, and a visit to Tahiti in 1914.

Strickland is created as an extreme version of the &quot;modern artist as &#x27;genius&#x27;&quot;, who is indifferent and frequently hostile to the people around him.

Writing in 1953, Maugham described the idea for the book as arising during a year that he spent living in Paris in 1904: The idea remained in his mind for ten years, until a visit to Tahiti in 1914, where Maugham was able to meet people who had known Gauguin, inspired him to start writing.

The critic Amy Dickson examines the relationship between Gauguin and Strickland. She contrasts the novel&#x27;s description of Strickland, &quot;his faults are accepted as the necessary complement of his merits... but one thing can never be doubtful, and that is that he had genius&quot;, with Gauguin&#x27;s description of himself: Dickson sums up the novel as follows:

According to some sources, the title, the meaning of which is not explicitly revealed in the book, was taken from a review in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; of Maugham&#x27;s novel &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;, in which the novel&#x27;s protagonist, Philip Carey, is described as being &quot;so busy yearning for the moon that he never saw the sixpence at his feet.&quot; According to a 1956 letter from Maugham, &quot;If you look on the ground in search of a sixpence, you don&#x27;t look up, and so miss the moon.&quot; Maugham&#x27;s title echoes the description of Gauguin by his contemporary biographer, Meier-Graefe (1908): &quot;He [Gauguin] may be charged with having always wanted something else.&quot;

==Adaptations==
The book was made into a stage play in 1925 at the New Theatre, with Henry Ainley as Strickland and Eileen Sharp as Ata. A film of the same name directed and written by Albert Lewin, was released in 1942, starring George Sanders as Charles Strickland.

The novel served as the basis for a 1957 opera, also titled &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot;, by John Gardner to a libretto by Patrick Terry which premiered at Sadlers Wells.

S Lee Pogostin adapted it for American TV in 1959. That production, &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; (1959), starred Laurence Olivier, with Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in supporting roles.

==In popular culture==

Ray Noble&#x27;s dance band hit &quot;We&#x27;ve Got the Moon and Sixpence&quot; (1932), sung by Al Bowlly, takes its name from the book.

&quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; is central to the protagonist&#x27;s solving the mystery in the Howard Pease novel &quot;The Ship Without a Crew&quot; (1934).

The book was mentioned in Agatha Christie&#x27;s mystery (Hercule Poirot series) novel &quot;Five Little Pigs&quot; (1942), when Poirot asks one of the suspects (Angela Warren) if she read the book at the time the crime was committed. The victim in the case is a married artist infatuated with a younger woman he yearns to paint, and for whom he may or may not be about to abandon his wife. 

It was mentioned in the James Jones novel &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1951), in a conversation between Sergeant Warden and Corporal Mazzioli.

Jack Kerouac mentions the book in his novella &quot;The Subterraneans&quot; (1958).

In the opening scene of François Truffaut&#x27;s film &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1966), an adaptation of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1953 novel of the same name, several firemen are preparing books for burning. In the crowd of onlookers is a little boy who picks up one of the books and thumbs through it before his father takes it from him and throws it on the pile with the rest. That book is &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot;.

It is mentioned frequently in two Stephen King novels: &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; (1998); and, in passing, &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; (2015). 

The book (with its title visible) is handed to Major Gale &quot;Buck&quot; Cleven in episode eight of the 2024 series &quot;Masters of the Air&quot;.

<text>Fantasia Monique Barrino-Taylor (born June 30, 1984), known professionally by her mononym Fantasia, is an American singer and actress. She rose to prominence in 2004 for her performance of the &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; standard &quot;Summertime&quot; during the third season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, and eventually became that season&#x27;s winner. Following her victory, Barrino became the second woman to have her first single debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, following Lauryn Hill, when her debut single &quot;I Believe&quot;, launched atop the chart. Her accolades include two Billboard Music Awards and a Grammy Award, along with nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a BAFTA Award. In 2024, &quot;Time&quot; named her one of the 100 most influential people. 

Barrino&#x27;s debut album &quot;Free Yourself&quot; (2004), was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album garnered three Grammy Award nominations, including Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance for her recording of &quot;Summertime&quot;. She went on to release the hit single &quot;When I See U&quot;, from her second album &quot;Fantasia&quot; (2006), recorded the duet &quot;Put You Up on Game&quot; with Aretha Franklin in 2007, and released later albums &quot;Back to Me&quot; (2010) and &quot;Side Effects of You&quot; (2013), with both peaking at number-two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Her single &quot;Bittersweet&quot;, won her a Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance in 2011.

Barrino released her New York Times Best-Selling autobiography &quot;Life Is Not a Fairy Tale&quot; (2005), which was adapted into the 2006 television film, which she starred in. She portrayed Celie Johnson in the Broadway musical &quot;The Color Purple&quot; from 2007 to 2008, which earned her a Theatre World Award for Best Debut Performance. She reprised her role in the 2023 film adaptation, for which she earned nominations for a Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Actress and won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Motion Picture.

== Early life and education ==
Barrino was born to Diane and Joseph Barrino and raised in High Point, North Carolina. She began singing at the age of five. R&amp;B duo K-Ci &amp; JoJo are her first cousins. Her uncles, The Barrino Brothers, were a 1970s R&amp;B band.

She attended Andrews High School in High Point, North Carolina. Feeling embarrassed and harassed after she was raped by a classmate, she dropped out of high school. She became pregnant at 16, and on August 8, 2001, she gave birth to a daughter with her ex-boyfriend Brandel Shouse.

== Career ==
=== 2004–2005: &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;Free Yourself&quot; ===
Barrino&#x27;s show was a staging of the &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; standard &quot;Summertime&quot; that left her in tears from &quot;feeling the song&quot; and earned praise from the judges and was named amongst the AOL&#x27;s 2004 list of greatest television moments.

For the final performance of the season, Barrino offered a second performance of &quot;Summertime&quot; that again drew praise from the judges; Simon Cowell remarked that she was the best contestant to ever compete in any competition, including the more than seventy &quot;Idol&quot; champions crowned nationally and internationally since the show began its first global incarnations. On the finale, over 65 million votes were cast to determine the winner on May 26, 2004, up from 24 million in 2003. Barrino defeated runner-up Diana DeGarmo by 1.3 million votes. At age 19, she was the youngest &quot;American Idol&quot; winner until May 23, 2007, when then 17-year-old Jordin Sparks won the title.

Barrino participated in the U.S. tour with the other &quot;American Idol&quot; finalists, and appeared in the 2004 Christmas special, &quot;Kelly, Ruben and Fantasia: Home for the Holidays&quot; as well.

Barrino&#x27;s brother auditioned for the eighth season of &quot;American Idol&quot; but failed to make it to the Hollywood round.

==== Performances ====

After winning &quot;American Idol&quot;, Barrino signed to J Records with 19 Entertainment and began work on her debut album. In June 2004, she released her debut single, &quot;I Believe&quot;, which later debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This number-one debut made Barrino the first artist in history to achieve this with a first single. On the sales chart, the single spent eleven consecutive weeks at number one, giving it the longest consecutive stay on top of that chart for an &quot;American Idol&quot; contestant. The CD single, &quot;I Believe&quot;, went on to become the top selling single of 2004 in the U.S., and has since been certified double platinum by the CRIA. She also won three Billboard Music Awards for the single.

Barrino released her debut studio album, &quot;Free Yourself&quot;, in November 2004. It debuted at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 240,000 copies in its first week. To date, it has sold over two million copies worldwide, and was certified Platinum in the U.S. The singles &quot;Truth Is&quot; and &quot;Free Yourself&quot; became R&amp;B hits, reaching number two and number three respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, while the controversial &quot;Baby Mama&quot;—which critics accused of romanticizing single motherhood—reached the top twenty. Barrino did even better on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Adult R&amp;B Airplay, where she was the first artist of any kind to simultaneously hold the top two spots of the top three, and &quot;Truth Is&quot; spent 14 weeks at the number one position. Barrino was named the number-one artist of the Adult Urban Contemporary format for 2005 according to the December 13, 2005, issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

Through the spring and winter of 2005, Barrino made many television appearances to promote her album. She played Aretha Franklin in an episode of the series &quot;American Dreams&quot;, singing &quot;Respect&quot;; guest voiced on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;A Star Is Torn&quot;; and guest starred as herself in a cameo role on the sitcom &quot;All of Us&quot;. She appeared three times as a musical guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Jay Leno. On March 25, 2005, Barrino performed at the thirty-sixth NAACP Image Awards in honor of Illinois Senator Barack Obama after winning the award for Outstanding Female Artist. In May 2005, Barrino went on her first tour with her own live band, with soul singers Kem and Rashaan Patterson. She also appeared as a headliner at several music festivals including the Saint Lucia Jazz Festival and the Reggae Sumfest in Jamaica. In October 2005, she received good notices as an opening act for Kanye West&#x27;s Touch the Sky Tour.

=== 2006–2007: &quot;Fantasia&quot;, acting debut and Broadway ===
In 2006, Barrino was nominated for three Grammy Awards for her debut album. Though she did not win any awards, she performed at the 48th annual telecast with several artists including Aerosmith, Joss Stone, John Legend, Maroon 5, and Ciara in an all-star tribute to Sly and the Family Stone during the Grammy Award show. In August 2006, Barrino played herself in a &quot;Lifetime Television&quot; film based on her autobiography &quot;Life Is Not a Fairy Tale&quot;. The film was directed by Debbie Allen and debuted on August 19, 2006. The movie received nineteen million viewers throughout its debut weekend. &quot;The Fantasia Barrino Story: Life is Not a Fairy Tale&quot; has also become the network&#x27;s second most viewed program of all time. In 2006, Barrino released her second album &quot;Fantasia&quot;, that featured the single &quot;When I See U&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for eight weeks. 

Barrino had many musical collaborations during the fall of 2006 including a remake of The Clark Sisters&#x27; &quot;Endow Me&quot; which featured Faith Evans, Lil&#x27; Mo, and Coko of SWV; a remake of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s 1976 song &quot;I Wish&quot; with Patti LaBelle and Yolanda Adams for the soundtrack to the 2006 animated film &quot;Happy Feet&quot;; and most notably her duet with Aretha Franklin &quot;Put You Up on Game&quot;, which was recorded at that time and later released in 2007.
She released her self-titled second effort, &quot;Fantasia&quot;, on December 12, 2006. The album involved production by Missy Elliott, Swizz Beatz, Babyface, Diane Warren, and others, and has since spawned the singles &quot;Hood Boy&quot; produced by Tone Mason, &quot;When I See U&quot;, and &quot;Only One U&quot; and went on to be certified gold. &quot;When I See U&quot; became her first single to top the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, remaining at the number one spot for eight consecutive weeks. The single stayed on the chart for over a year and was named number eight on the Billboard Best of The 2000s R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs.

In February 2007, Barrino appeared and performed on &quot;American Idol&quot;, and announced that she would be taking over the role of Celie from LaChanze who originated the role in the Broadway musical &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1982 novel of the same name by Alice Walker. After appearing on &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, the musical received a boost of over two million in pre-ticket sales in one week. Leading up to her first performance on April 10, 2007, the play garnered a total of 6.5 million in pre-ticket sales. Barrino performed at the 2007 Tony Awards in a tribute to Atlanta&#x27;s Alliance Theater in which &quot;The Color Purple&quot; got its start. Barrino was given the Theatre World Award and the Best Replacement Star Broadway.com Award. Barrino was initially scheduled for a limited six-month engagement ending in October 2007 but had her run extended until January 6, 2008. &quot;The Color Purple&quot; box office saw a thirty-four-million-dollar jump in sales since Barrino started in the show, a third of the play&#x27;s 100 million dollar earning since its debut in 2005. In the September 2008 issue of &quot;Sister 2 Sister&quot; magazine, Barrino revealed that the reason for her absences in &quot;The Color Purple&quot; was because of the development of a cyst on her vocal cords. She was ordered to immediately undergo surgery which later revealed that she in fact had a tumor on her vocal cords. She now reports that after a successful surgery, the tumor was completely removed and she is now well. For her role she earned a Theatre World Award for Best Debut Performance.

=== 2008–2010: &quot;Back to Me&quot; and &quot;Fantasia for Real&quot; ===
Barrino received two Grammy nominations for her sophomore release, &quot;Fantasia&quot; and subsequently began work on her third studio album in 2008. She stated on the red carpet of the 2008 Grammy Awards that the style of the new album would be a blending of the avenues she has touched musically, which include &quot;American Idol&quot; and Broadway. She also revealed that she would be writing some of the album&#x27;s songs and would collaborate again with Missy Elliott, The Underdogs, and Midi Mafia, who produced one of her biggest hits, &quot;When I See U&quot;.

Midi Mafia produced the majority of Barrino&#x27;s third studio album. Also, hip hop duo Rock City were confirmed to be writing for the new project. At the time, they had recorded four songs together. She also worked with songwriter-producer Rich King which spawned two songs for her third release. KP, Eric Hudson and Raphael Saadiq are a few people that also became involved on the project. Barrino confirmed that about 75 percent of the album was complete by mid-2009, and that fans should&#x27;ve expected a new single by the fall of 2009, with the album due to be released in early 2010. This was later delayed, and while recording her new album, Barrino decided to do a great deal of it the &quot;old fashioned way&quot;, inviting a live orchestra to record in the studio with her.

In June 2008, Barrino parted ways with 19 Entertainment, but remained with 19 Recordings and J Records. She said that after the release of her third album, she plans to release a gospel album. She performed with her mother, Diane Barrino, in a Thanksgiving special on BET&#x27;s &quot;Bobby Jones Gospel&quot;. Barrino also appeared on Jennifer Hudson&#x27;s self-titled album, on the song &quot;I&#x27;m His Only Woman&quot;, which was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award, though it did not win. Barrino reprised the role of Celie in the national tour of &quot;The Color Purple&quot; during its Washington D.C., Chicago, Atlanta, and Los Angeles stops.

Barrino also stars in a reality show produced by World of Wonder. Titled &quot;Fantasia for Real&quot;, it premiered on January 11, 2010, on VH1 to rave reviews and ratings. The show&#x27;s first season ended in July 2010 with its second began on September 19, 2010. &quot;Even Angels&quot;, a song from Barrino&#x27;s third studio album, produced by The Stereotypes and written by Heather Bright, was never released to radio . She performed the song on The Oprah Winfrey Show on February 3, 2010. The album&#x27;s first official single, &quot;Bittersweet&quot;, was released on May 11, 2010, and has gone on to reach number seven on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart as well as number seventy-four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Barrino&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Back to Me&quot;, was released on August 24, 2010. Barrino cited Tina Turner, Queen and Aretha Franklin as influences, and like musicians she admired from their era, she recorded with a live band. The album has been promoted by appearances on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot; among others. On March 28, 2010, Barrino also performed &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at WWE WrestleMania XXVI. To promote the album, Barrino embarked on her first solo concert tour, &quot;Back to Me Tour&quot; in the fall of 2010. Barrino appeared on the track &quot;I Want to Be Your Man&quot; from Charlie Wilson&#x27;s album &quot;Just Charlie&quot;. In the summer of 2010, she appeared as a guest judge alongside Wayne Brady, on episode 11 of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;.

=== 2011–2016: &quot;Side Effects of You&quot; and &quot;The Definition Of&quot;===
On February 13, 2011, Barrino won her first Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;Bittersweet&quot;. In 2011, Barrino was cast in her first film role, playing gospel singer Mahalia Jackson in a biographical film based on the 1993 book &quot;Got to Tell It: Mahalia Jackson, Queen of Gospel&quot;. It was later reported that the film was fully endorsed by the Mahalia Jackson estate. Barrino also would receive not only the top salary in the project but a percentage of the box office revenue the film creates. Production was originally planned to begin in October 2011 in New Orleans and Chicago with a release date of late 2012 and a premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. In August 2011, organizers of the International Hair Show in Atlanta, Georgia, said medical conditions requiring bed rest had forced Barrino to cancel her scheduled performance there. After reports were released suggesting that Barrino would not be involved with the film, Double Dutch Productions LLC, the production company behind &quot;Mahalia!&quot;, released a statement saying it &quot;extends apologies to Barrino for the inaccurate, non-factual and disparaging statements of Ms. Barrino&#x27;s reputation, character and image.&quot;

In 2011, Aretha Franklin stated Barrino and Jennifer Hudson were on her list of people to play her in a planned biographical movie. Hudson ended up portraying her in the film &quot;Respect&quot; (2021). On October 7, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding J Records along with Arista Records and Jive Records. With the shutdown, Barrino (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release her future material on the RCA Records brand. On February 13, 2012, VH1 named Barrino 32nd out of the 100 Greatest Women in Music. Barrino was featured on a cover version of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;True Colors&quot; with Kelly Price and Faith Evans from Evans&#x27; compilation album &quot;R&amp;B Divas&quot;, which was released on October 2, 2012.

On December 19, 2012, Barrino premiered her new single, &quot;Lose to Win&quot;. During an interview on Steve Harvey&#x27;s morning radio show, Barrino revealed that the album&#x27;s release date would be March 13, 2013. However, on February 28, 2013, via her Facebook page, Barrino announced that her album would be released on April 23, 2013. The album was available for pre-order on March 19, 2013. On April 19, 2013, Barrino revealed that her next single would be &quot;Without Me&quot;, featuring Kelly Rowland and Missy Elliott. In June 2013, Barrino embarked on a five-date tour with Andrea Bocelli. In an interview on &quot;Today&quot; in that same month, she revealed that she will return to Broadway in October 2013.

Barrino starred in the musical revue &quot;After Midnight&quot; which opened on Broadway on November 3, 2013, with previews beginning on October 18 at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre. Her role ended on February 9, 2014. She had received rave reviews from critics for her performance. &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote &quot;... although I admired Ms. Barrino&#x27;s heartfelt performance in &#x27;The Color Purple,&#x27; I was surprised at how smoothly and intuitively she slid into the vocal persona of a jazz singer.&quot; Barrino was the first of a rotating roster of special guest stars that also included k.d. lang, Toni Braxton and Babyface. On March 20, 2014, it was announced that Barrino will return to the production for a second stint for four weeks, beginning on May 13 through June 8. Barrino performed alongside the cast and Patti LaBelle and Gladys Knight at the 68th Tony Awards. In August 2013, Barrino co-wrote and recorded the theme song &quot;In the Middle of the Night&quot; for &quot;The Butler&quot;. The song was longlisted for an Academy Award for Best Original Song but did not end up receiving a nomination.

In September 2005, Barrino published a memoir, dictated to a freelance writer, titled &quot;Life Is Not a Fairy Tale&quot;. In it, she revealed she was functionally illiterate. In 2006, following the release of her autobiography, Barrino&#x27;s father sued her for $10 million after she said unflattering things about him in the book that he claimed were false.

On December 9, 2008, Barrino&#x27;s , lakefront home in Charlotte&#x27;s Glynmoor Lakes at Piper Glen community was in foreclosure and would be up for auction. Her home, also in Piper Glen, is unaffected. The home was due to be auctioned in January 2009 by the Mecklenburg County Sheriff&#x27;s Office after the company Broward Energy Partners, which had paid over $68,000 of her taxes in 2006, said it had not been fully repaid. The auction earnings were to be used to finish reimbursing the company for the loan, on which Barrino had paid back $10,000. The auction was canceled after Barrino&#x27;s attorneys and the lender reached an &quot;eleventh-hour deal&quot;, the details of which were not disclosed.

She dated former NFL player Michael Clayton, who was at the time playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

An August 2010 divorce filing in Mecklenburg County District Court alleges that Barrino had a year-long relationship with Antwaun Cook, who was married, bringing up the subject of alienation of affection laws in North Carolina. Barrino claimed the two began dating after Cook and his wife separated. In December 2010, a North Carolina judge ruled in Barrino&#x27;s favor, stating the Cooks&#x27; separation date was September 14, 2009, and not June 2010 as Paula previously claimed.

On August 9, 2010, Barrino was hospitalized in Pineville, North Carolina, due to overdosing on aspirin and an unknown sleep aid.

In December 2011 she gave birth to a son.

On July 18, 2015, she married Kendall Taylor, a businessman.

In 2019, Barrino stoked controversy during an interview on &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; radio show. She claimed women were not to lead their households, and that the reason so many women were single is because they were trying to be the leader of a relationship, a position that should fall to the man. Barrino also said it was &quot;generational curse&quot; women were trying to control relationships and stated her belief women should submit to their male partners.

In November 2020, Barrino revealed that she was expecting her first child with husband Kendall Taylor. In May 2021, she gave birth to a daughter.

On November 29, 2022, Sigma Gamma Rho sorority announced that Barrino was inducted as an honorary member of their sorority.

Barrino has said from childhood she has been influenced by soul singers Aretha Franklin, Patti LaBelle, and Chaka Khan, and grew up listening to jazz singers Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Cab Calloway and Nina Simone. Barrino has drawn many comparisons to her idols. LaBelle affectionately calls Barrino &quot;baby Patti&quot;. &quot;[Fantasia&#x27;s] just a baby me...when you see yourself in someone else, you say, &#x27;God I&#x27;m 70, she&#x27;s 30,&#x27; so she&#x27;s like the Patti Labelle from back in the day and everything and she&#x27;s so raw&quot;, LaBelle stated in an interview. She always credit her church upbringing and cites The Clark Sisters as one of her influences. Barrino is also an admirer of rock music and was influenced by Queen, Tina Turner and Elton John.

During an interview with Billboard.com, Barrino has stated that she would like to go in more of a rock direction for her fifth studio album. &quot;This whole rock soul direction has been on my heart. I&#x27;ll always be soulful: I started singing in the church at the age of five. So that will never go anywhere. But there&#x27;s a certain side of me that wants to tap into that whole rock world. It&#x27;s hard to come from R&amp;B to that. But it&#x27;s something I believe in and will fight for&quot;, Barrino said in the interview.

Over the course of her career, Barrino has inspired other artists, including &quot;American Idol&quot; season eleven contestant Joshua Ledet who was dubbed &quot;Mantasia&quot; by fans, the media and even Barrino herself.

<text>Diana Nicole DeGarmo (born June 16, 1987) is an American singer. She rose to fame in 2004 as the runner-up of the third season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, releasing her debut studio album, &quot;Blue Skies&quot;, later that year. The following year, DeGarmo ventured into a career in musical theatre. She has starred in two Broadway, one off-Broadway and three national tours. She made her television acting debut in a six-month arc as Angelina Veneziano on &quot;The Young and the Restless.&quot; DeGarmo has since released two extended plays, &quot;Unplugged in Nashville&quot; (2009) and &quot;Live to Love&quot; (2012). She is married to fifth season &quot;American Idol&quot; finalist Ace Young.

== Early life ==
Diana DeGarmo was born on June 16, 1987 in Birmingham, Alabama, but was raised primarily in the Atlanta suburb of Snellville, Georgia. DeGarmo began singing at a young age, including the 1997 Georgia Music Hall of Fame Awards, and in Atlanta-based stage productions of &quot;Annie&quot; and &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.
At age ten she was part of the Cartoon Gang on The Cartoon Network, appearing in various bumper segments. As a third grader she was a Coca-Cola Kid during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. The next year she sang at Opryland USA during the Christmas season. In 2002, she was named Miss Georgia Teen and was also a finalist on the NBC talent search program &quot;America&#x27;s Most Talented Kid&quot;.

== Career ==
=== &quot;American Idol&quot; ===
DeGarmo took part in the third season of &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2004, finishing second to winner Fantasia Barrino. She was 16 years old at the time she competed.

During her run on &quot;American Idol&quot; she was thrice in the bottom three, but was the first contestant sent to safety each time and thus never in the bottom two. She became one of the front-runners by week 6.

She performed around the country with the other third-season top-ten contestants during the summer of 2004.

====Performances====
=== Post-&quot;Idol&quot; music ===

DeGarmo was signed to RCA Records shortly after the &quot;Idol&quot; finale and released her single, &quot;Dreams,&quot; on June 29, 2004. The single reached number 2 in Canada and number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The single also included her version of &quot;I Believe&quot; and a remake of Melissa Manchester&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Out Loud&quot;. She recorded her debut album in between &quot;Idol&quot; summer tour stops.

DeGarmo&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Blue Skies&quot;, was released on December 7, 2004, to opening week sales of 47,000. The album debuted at number 52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and included songs written by future American Idol judge Kara DioGuardi, as well as Desmond Child, Adam Shankman, and Andreas Carlsson, among others. As of fall 2008, the album had sold 168,000 copies with little to no advertising. The lone single from the CD, &quot;Emotional&quot;, was released to radio in November 2004, peaking at number 54 on the Mediabase Pop Chart. She toured independently in the spring and summer of 2005 in support of &quot;Blue Skies.&quot; During the same time she recorded a song for the soundtrack of the Disney movie &quot;Ice Princess&quot;. &quot;Reaching for Heaven&quot;, written by Desmond Child, can be heard during the climactic ice skating scene in the movie. In June 2005, RCA and DeGarmo parted ways. On September 17, 2005, DeGarmo received the Horizon Award at the Georgia Music Hall Of Fame Awards ceremony; the award recognizes Georgia artists on the path to successful and lengthy careers.

DeGarmo began recording a pop/R&amp;B album in 2007; however, she backed out of the project to return to her country music roots. After filming CMT&#x27;s &quot;Gone Country&quot; in late 2007, she relocated to Nashville. She signed to John Rich&#x27;s production company and recorded material with him in 2008. The songs were never released and DeGarmo moved on to other collaborators. In February 2009 she self-released a four-song acoustic country EP, &quot;Unplugged in Nashville&quot;, to digital retailers.

In March 2012, DeGarmo wrote &quot;Good Goodbye&quot; for use with her character on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. It was released to iTunes and was included on her May 2012 EP &quot;Live to Love&quot;. After producing a music video for &quot;Good Goodbye,&quot; fans were asked to vote on two versions of the video on the &quot;American Idol&quot; website. The winning video became available on iTunes.

DeGarmo&#x27;s second album, &quot;Gemini&quot;, was released August 2, 2019 with a release concert at Sony Hall. DeGarmo presented and streamed a live concert of &quot;Gemini&quot; in the summer of 2020, ultimately winning the 2020 BroadwayWorld Award for Best Streamed Concert.

=== Musical theatre ===
DeGarmo made her major stage debut as Maria in an American Musical Theatre of San Jose production of &quot;West Side Story&quot; in November 2005. She followed with her Broadway debut in a four-month run of &quot;Hairspray&quot; as nerdy Penny Pingleton taking over for Tracy Miller in February 2006. She also performed the lead role of Brooklyn in the 2006 national tour of &quot;Brooklyn: The Musical&quot; alongside one of her idols, Melba Moore. DeGarmo returned to &quot;Hairspray&quot; for a second engagement from September 2006 to February 2007. She made her Carnegie Hall debut in April 2007 at a tribute to Neil Sedaka.

In 2008, DeGarmo was set to star in a Broadway revival of &quot;Godspell&quot; at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, but on August 19, it was announced that the show was postponed indefinitely due to the loss of an investor.

In May 2009, DeGarmo starred in the musical revue &quot;Back to Bacharach and David,&quot; which featured the songs of Burt Bacharach and Hal David. The Kathy Najimy created and produced show played a limited two-week engagement in Los Angeles at the Music Box Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. In July 2009, she starred as the narrator in the Oklahoma Lyric&#x27;s Theatre production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; alongside &quot;Idol&quot; alum Anthony Federov. Her next role saw her return to New York City when she debuted in August 2009 as Sarah, the &quot;sexy, blind librarian&quot; and love interest of Toxie, in the off-Broadway musical &quot;The Toxic Avenger.&quot; The show was housed at New World Stages. DeGarmo remained with &quot;Avenger&quot; until it closed on January 3, 2010.

DeGarmo made her return to Broadway, starring as Sheila in the Broadway company of &quot;Hair&quot; where she met her future husband, Ace Young. She succeeded original cast member Caissie Levy beginning March 9, 2010. She played Sheila until the show&#x27;s closure on June 27, 2010.

DeGarmo played the role of Doralee Rhodes in the national tour of &quot;9 to 5&quot;, which was launched in Nashville on September 21, 2010. She ended her run as Doralee after the July 2011 Minneapolis tour stop.

DeGarmo appeared on musical theatre composer Scott Alan&#x27;s third album, &quot;What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up&quot; with the song &quot;I Wish&quot;, released November 1, 2010.

She reprised the role of Penny Pingleton in the Hollywood Bowl production of &quot;Hairspray&quot;, which ran from August 5–7, 2011.

DeGarmo has done several readings for new musicals over the years, starting with &quot;In Your Dreams&quot; in early October 2006. In 2009, she played the title role in a concert for &quot;Liberty: A New Musical&quot; at the New York Musical Theatre Festival (NYMF) and in 2009 played the role of &quot;Chris&quot; in the much anticipated reading of an updated &quot;Carrie: The Musical&quot;. In 2011 and again in 2013 she played Fern/Vylette in Manhattan industry readings of &quot;Jawbreaker,&quot; a musical based on the 1990s movie of the same name.

In January 2013, DeGarmo played &quot;Sally&quot; in the pre-Broadway run of the new musical &quot;NERDS,&quot; in Raleigh, NC, for the North Carolina Theatre.

In June 2015, DeGarmo starred as Dorothy in Studio Tenn&#x27;s production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; at The Schermerhorn Symphony Theater in Nashville, Tennessee. She and Young are set to lead the first national tour of &quot;First Date&quot;, which is set to launch in the fall of 2020.

She played Lucy in the 2016 to 2017 world tour of &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot;.

DeGarmo joined the cast of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in October 2011. She portrayed Angelina Veneziano, the daughter of resident mobster, Angelo. Her character was a terrible singer who was obsessed with gaining the affections of Kevin Fisher. Her character went through a redemption arc, and by the time her last episode aired in March 2012, Angelina not only could sing, she had matured into a kinder and gentler character.

In film, DeGarmo played Dora Hand, a dance hall singer in the 2012 western film &quot;Wyatt Earp&#x27;s Revenge.&quot;

DeGarmo made a cameo appearance as herself in the Lifetime Network holiday movie &quot;All About Christmas Eve&quot; starring Haylie Duff. She also appeared on the second season of TLC&#x27;s wedding dress show &quot;Brides of Beverly Hills&quot;, which documented her search for a wedding dress.

DeGarmo was nominated for the Jack Nance Breakthrough Performance Award at VisionFest, where Alto won the Audience Award.

<doc id="467411" wikidata="Q2636013" url="?curid=467411" title="Chatteris">
<text>Chatteris () is a market town and civil parish in the Fenland district of Cambridgeshire, England, situated in the Fens between Huntingdon, March and Ely. The town is in the North East Cambridgeshire parliamentary constituency.

The parish of Chatteris is large, covering 6,099 hectares, and for much of its history was a raised island in the low-lying wetland of the Fens. Mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, the town has evidence of settlement from the Neolithic period. After several fires in the 18th and 19th centuries, the majority of the town&#x27;s housing dates from the late Victorian period onwards, with the tower of the parish church the only medieval building remaining.

Following the draining of the Fens, beginning in the 17th century and completed in the 19th century, the town&#x27;s economy has been based on agriculture and related industry. Due to its proximity to Cambridge, Huntingdon and Peterborough, the town has emerged as a commuter town. The town had a population of 11,011 at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2021.

==Toponymy==
The origin of the name &quot;Chatteris&quot; is uncertain. The name is first attested in a charter of 974 (in a fourteenth-century copy), as &quot;Cæateric&quot; and in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Catriz&quot;, &quot;Cietriz&quot;, &quot;Cetriz&quot; and &quot;Cateriz&quot;. The &quot;Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names&quot; derives the name from a putatively Old English personal name &quot;Ceatta&quot; and a word * (&quot;ridge&quot;), thus meaning &quot;Ceatta&#x27;s ridge&quot;. Others have suggested, however, that the name derives from a Common Brittonic word corresponding to modern Welsh (&quot;wood&quot;) compounded with Common Brittonic *&quot;rïcc&quot; (&quot;groove&quot;), though Richard Coates and Andrew Breeze characterise this interpretation as &quot;frankly [...] most uncertain&quot;). Others again suggest that name probably derives from the Celtic &quot;Cedrid&quot; – &quot;Ced&quot; meaning a wood and &quot;Rid&quot;, a ford, although it may also derive from &quot;cader&quot;, meaning hill fort, suggesting a similar site to the nearby Stonea Camp.

== History ==
=== Prehistory and early history ===
Archaeological evidence has been found of Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements in the area, and Chatteris possesses what has been interpreted as the only upstanding Neolithic boundaries in Fenland. Saxon evidence is less well preserved, although in 679, Hunna, the chaplain to Æthelthryth of Ely built a hermitage on Honey Hill. More apocryphally, Chatteris is reputed to have been the last refuge of Boudica as she fled from the Romans.

=== Medieval period ===
The miraculous story of the first known parishioner of the town, Bricstan, is documented in the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; by the Chronicler Orderic Vitalis (1075 – c.1142). According to the legend, Bricstan was a pious free tenant from the town who had joined the monastery at Ely Cathedral in 1115 to begin training as a monk. However, he was accused of theft and imprisoned in London. The legend recounts that one night he had a vision of Saint Etheldreda coming towards him, and as if by a miracle, his heavy chains fell from him and he was shackled no longer. When he awoke from his dream, he discovered that this was indeed true and he was free of his chains. The wife of Henry I, Matilda of Scotland, heard of the miracle, and she assured herself that he was no rogue or thief, issued a writ of pardon and declared him a free man.

During the Medieval period, the town was dominated by Chatteris Abbey, a small Benedictine nunnery dedicated to St Mary, built in 980 by Eadnoth the Younger for Aelfwyn or Alfwen the niece of King Edgar and one of only eight nunneries mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. The first abbess of Chatteris was Eadnoth&#x27;s sister, Aelfwyn. Throughout its existence, the abbey was comparatively poor compared to other foundations, due to a lack of royal patronage and a consequent lack of tithe estates. As a result, the abbey survived the first wave of closures during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but was surrendered to the king&#x27;s commissioners in 1538, by which time there were eleven nuns in residence.

At this date fourteen local families still used the abbey church as parochial but this, unusually, did not save it from demolition, the parishioners being transferred to nearby St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church in the area. It has been conjectured that due to the short space between them, the parish church may have been the abbey church, although Claire Breay&#x27;s &quot;Cartulary of Chatteris Abbey&quot; discounts this idea, citing that historical documentation clearly defines two separate churches. A range of the cloister buildings survived as part of a mansion known as Park House. This was demolished in 1847 and the site has now completely vanished beneath streets and housing, although the &quot;Park Streets&quot; of Chatteris mark the boundary of its walls and several buildings contain stone originating from the abbey. A large portion of the town was destroyed by a great fire in 1310, which destroyed the nunnery and a large portion of the church, leaving only sections of the base of the tower.

=== Early modern and contemporary ===

Later fires in 1706 and 1864 destroyed most medieval and Georgian architecture, and a large proportion of the town&#x27;s listed buildings date from the Victorian period onwards. However, many of the pasture fields on the outskirts of the town have evidence of ridge and furrow farming practices, although these are under threat by current building proposals.

To the north of the town runs the Forty Foot Drain, a large river also called Vermuyden&#x27;s Drain, after the Dutch engineer whose name is associated with the fen drainage works of the middle of the 17th century. Several of the older buildings of the town show evidence of the Dutch architectural style.

Chatteris is a market town and has possessed this designation since 1834, although an earlier market existed in the town, which was discontinued due to poor roads in 1808. A small market is still held every Friday.

Following the Beeching Axe, Chatteris railway station, formerly on the St Ives extension of the Great Eastern Railway, was closed in March 1967. The station buildings no longer exist.

== Geography ==
Chatteris is situated between Huntingdon, St Ives, Peterborough, March and Ely, in the middle of the Fens—the lowest-lying area in the United Kingdom—with most of the land surrounding the town being below sea level, although the highest point in the Fens (36 feet above sea level) is within Chatteris&#x27;s parish boundaries. The peaty land surrounding the town is largely used for agriculture, drained by numerous ditches and dykes, and there are two large drainage rivers near the town – the Forty Foot Drain, also known as Vermuyden&#x27;s Drain, and the Sixteen Foot Drain.

Chatteris is a key turning point on the A141 road (known as the Isle of Ely way) and the starting point of the A142 road to Ely and Suffolk (known as Ireton&#x27;s Way). The town also has important links to Cambridge and the A14 via the B1050 to Bar Hill. The town centre traffic was bypassed in 1986, with the disused route of the former St Ives extension of the Great Eastern Railway being used to build the A141 to March and Guyhirn.

=== Climate ===
There are no Met Office recording stations in the Fens, but an indication of rainfall and temperature of the county town Cambridge on the edge of the Fens shows that rainfall is below the national average, and in a wider study of East Anglia, the region had temperatures comparable with London, the warmest part of the UK.

== Governance ==

There are three tiers of local government covering Chatteris, at civil parish (town), district, and county level: Chatteris Town Council, Fenland District Council, and Cambridgeshire County Council. The district and county councils are also members of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, led by the directly elected Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. The town council is based at 14 Church Lane.

The town is part of the North East Cambridgeshire parliamentary seat, whose Member of Parliament is currently Steve Barclay, a Conservative.

===Administrative history===
Chatteris was an ancient parish in the North Witchford hundred of Cambridgeshire. It was administered by its vestry and manorial courts until 1873, when the parish was made a local government district, with an elected local board. Such local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

The North Witchford hundred formed part of the Isle of Ely, which was historically a liberty under the secular jurisdiction of the Bishop of Ely. The bishop&#x27;s jurisdiction was ended by the Liberty of Ely Act 1837 (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. 53). Between 1889 and 1965, the Isle of Ely was an administrative county with its own county council, whilst also forming part of the wider geographical county of Cambridgeshire. Between 1965 and 1974, the administrative county covering Chatteris was called Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely.

Chatteris Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. District-level functions passed to the new Fenland District Council. A successor parish called Chatteris was created covering the area of the abolished urban district, with its parish council taking the name Chatteris Town Council.

===Policing===
Under the Police Act 1964 and local government reform in 1974, the Isle of Ely Constabulary became part of the Mid-Anglia Constabulary until the present Cambridgeshire Constabulary was formed in 1974. A small police station is situated in East Park Street, but it is no longer open to the public.

== Economy ==
===Overview===
Chatteris is sited in particularly fertile agricultural land, and as such, the town&#x27;s local economy is largely based on this industry. Alan Bartlett and Sons Ltd, a major British grower and packer of root vegetables has a large facility in the town with over 2,500 hectares under cultivation, much of it growing parsnips and the Chantenay and Bushytops carrot. The company is a demerger of Albert Bartlett &amp; Sons, which are now based in Scotland. Rustler Produce Ltd, also based in Chatteris, is another major player in this industry, and a number of smaller vegetable producers and processors operate in the Chatteris area.

Another major employer in the town is Metalcraft (Stainless Metalcraft (Chatteris) Ltd). The company was established in the town in the late 19th century and over the years has manufactured diamond mining equipment and overhead cranes. The company is now part of the Avingtrans Group and specialises in creating engineered products for the oil, gas, nuclear and medical industries.

An Aldi supermarket located on Bridge Street opened in 2016. It was formerly a large Co-op which opened in 1990, trading under a variety of brandnames until its closure in 2014.

Another supermarket constructed on the A141 Fenland Way became the first of Tesco&#x27;s discount Jack&#x27;s-branded stores in the UK and hosted the press launch on 19 September 2018, opening to the public the following day. It is located within a larger building intended as a Tesco supermarket, constructed at a cost of £22 million but left mothballed following the company&#x27;s decision to halt the opening of 49 out-of-town supermarkets following poor financial results in October 2014. In 2022 Jack&#x27;s closed and converted to a Tesco store as originally intended. The other half opened as a Poundstretcher in 2018 which closed in 2023 and re-opened as a B&amp;M store. Alongside the two big stores is a smaller Screwfix store opened in 2020.

The traditional town centre stretches from Park Street through Market Hill to the High Street and generally features more specialist non-branch shops. The town centre has a post office but no banks following the closure of Barclays in 2019. The Petrou Brothers fish and chip shop in West Park Street won the 2006 National Fish and Chip Shop of the Year competition; the owners were presented with the award by chef Ainsley Harriott.

There are a number of small restaurants, pubs, tea shops and several members&#x27; clubs.

=== Transport ===
Chatteris was well served by local bus routes, with regular buses to the nearby towns of March, St Ives, Ely and the city of Cambridge. There are also occasional services to Huntingdon and Peterborough. However the decline in bus usage associated with Covid and more generally has led to the potential ending of all services.

The nearest railway stations are in March and Manea.

== Demographics==
The United Kingdom Census 2011 found the population of Chatteris to be 10,453. This was an increase of 1163 since 2001 which recorded 8,820 people living in 3,809 households, with the average number of people per dwelling 2.31. The 2001 census found that 98.9% of the population of the town were of the white ethnic group. The parish of Chatteris is large, covering 6,099 hectares, equalling an average population density of 1.45, although most of the dwellings are concentrated in a smaller area, the outskirts of the town consisting of farmland. 99.6% of residents lived in households, the remaining 0.4% lived in communal establishments.

=== Ethnic groups ===
The majority of the population in Chatteris state their ethnic group as &quot;White&quot;. At 97.2% this is higher than the average of 94.1 for England and Wales. Since 2011 diversity in Chatteris has increased slightly and all ethnic groups have increased in size except for &quot;Other&quot; but this is likely due to the addition of &quot;Mixed&quot; as an option in the 2011 census.

=== Languages ===
In the 2011 Census 2.3% of households in Chatteris reported to have no people in household who have English as a main language.

=== Religion ===
Christianity is the majority religion in Chatteris. From 2001 to 2011 it fell from 74.8% to 62.6%, partly due to a decrease in numbers but mostly due to population growth of which the majority have no religion. Despite the reduction in numbers the Christian population of Chatteris is above the average for England and Wales at 59.3%.

The parish church of St Peter &amp; St Paul is situated in the centre of the town. A church has been on the site since at least 1162, although the current tower dates from 1352. The building had fallen into disrepair during the 19th century, and the majority of the building is the result of an intensive restoration in 1910. This included restoring a pitched roof and adding new aisles, although the nave arches are original. The church of St Peter &amp; St Paul is a Grade I listed building. In 1935, a new two-manual Harrison &amp; Harrison organ was installed, a fine example of a pneumatic action instrument. Recent years have seen the construction of several new facilities, such as the Bricstan room extension. The church lists itself as of the low church branch of the Church of England. The church also hosts Catholic Church services.

The Emmanuel Church in East Park Street was created through the union of the Methodist, United Reformed and Baptist Union churches in Chatteris in 1990. It is based in the former United Reformed building in East Park Street. Several former chapel buildings exist around the town. The town has a Salvation Army citadel, also in East Park Street, and a Grace Baptist church, founded in 2010 and called Chatteris Community Church, meets in the King Edward centre on King Edward Street.

=== Migration ===
The majority of the population of Chatteris was born within the UK. 6.4% of residents were born outside the UK, this is below the national average of 13%.

=== Education ===

The town has three primary schools, Kingsfield Primary School (created in 2003 by the amalgamation of the former Burnsfield School and King Edward School), Glebelands School, which opened in the early months of 1994 and Cromwell Primary which opened in 2021. Cromwell Community College is an all-through school admitting primary school and secondary school age pupils. It was founded in 1939. The Isle College used to have a presence in the town, with a base in Grove House. However, this closed following the college&#x27;s merger with the College of West Anglia. The town has a library run by Cambridgeshire County Council.

==Culture==
===Music===
In 2005, British indie band Half Man Half Biscuitperhaps best known for &quot;The Trumpton Riots&quot; and &quot;Dickie Davies Eyes&quot;included a song entitled &quot;For What Is Chatteris...&quot; on their award-winning &quot;Achtung Bono&quot; album. The song extolled the virtues of the town, offset against how unsatisfying the best place in the world can suddenly become when the one you love is no longer there: &quot;a market town that lacks quintessence / that&#x27;s Chatteris without your presence&quot;. News of the song made the headlines of the &quot;Cambridgeshire Times&quot; and the &quot;Peterborough Evening Telegraph&quot; during September 2005, a month before the album&#x27;s official release.

=== Sport ===
Fen skating was very popular in the past. An illustration from 1823 by George Cruikshank shows the Wisbech coach in the background of a skating match.

The town&#x27;s football club, Chatteris Town, was founded in 1920 and currently play in the Kershaw Premier Division of the Cambridgeshire Football Association County League. 
The town also has a cricket club, Chatteris Cricket Club, which was founded in 1879. The club has five senior teams and four youth teams that compete in both the Fenland and Cambridgeshire leagues. Chatteris CC won the St Ivo Midweek League in 2008 and 2009 going both seasons unbeaten. 
The town also has a bowls club and a tennis club (St Peters). Chatteris Airfield is about north-northeast, which is mainly used for skydiving, and is the base of the North London Skydiving Centre. A flying school is also based at the airfield.

The town has one swimming pool, the Empress, which is privately owned and is a registered charity run by three trustees. It is open to members and can be booked for private hires or group sessions. It is home of the Chatteris Kingfishers swimming club, who after successes in 2008 compete in Division One of the 2009 &quot;Cambs Cup&quot; competition. Plans for a public swimming pool and leisure centre have been proposed by the council since 1990, but have yet to be approved. Proposals for the development of Cromwell Community College under the government&#x27;s BSF programme include significant leisure provisions and these are expected to start in 2010.
A new gym situated in the grounds of Cromwell Community College opened in 2013.

===Media===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, Heart East, and Greatest Hits Radio East. The town is served by these local newspapers, &quot;Fenland Citizen&quot; and &quot;Cambs Times&quot;.

=== Community activities and events ===
The town is noted for its annual display of Christmas lights, which are entirely funded by community donations and have been featured on BBC Look East. In 2008, a medieval-themed Historical Festival replaced the town&#x27;s traditional festival week.

The town has a museum https://www.chatterismuseum.org.uk/ run by volunteers, with several permanent exhibitions about local history, the Fens, Victoriana and the railways. Chatteris also has a Scout club, an Army Cadet Force and a youth football team.

Chatteris has morning and evening Women&#x27;s Institutes, which both meet at the King Edward Centre, and a Rotary Club which meet at the local fire station.

Since 2012 Chatteris has a branch of the University of the Third Age (U3A) which caters for people no longer in full time employment, with a talk every month at the general meeting held at the King Edward Centre, plus over 20 interest groups of various kinds, and a number of trips and theatre visits are also provided during the year.

Chatteris in Bloom is a charity responsible for entering the town in to the annual &quot;Anglia in Bloom&quot; competition. Chatteris achieved the highest gold award in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022 and in 2023 was joint winner of Anglia in Bloom with Huntingdon.

<text>The Santa Ana Freeway is one of the principal freeways in Southern California, connecting Los Angeles and its southeastern suburbs including the freeway&#x27;s namesake, the city of Santa Ana. The freeway begins at its junction with the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405, I-405), called the El Toro Y, in Irvine, signed as I-5. From there, it generally goes southeast to northwest to the East Los Angeles Interchange, where it takes the designation of U.S. Route 101 (US 101). It then proceeds northwest to the Four Level Interchange (also known as the Bill Keene Memorial Interchange) in downtown Los Angeles. Formerly, the entirety of the route was marked as US 101 until the 1964 highway renumbering, which truncated US 101 to the East Los Angeles Interchange and designated the rest of the freeway as I-5.

North of the East Los Angeles Interchange complex, I-5 follows the Golden State Freeway. South of the El Toro Y, I-5 takes on the San Diego Freeway name from I-405.

An abundance of landmarks, most importantly Disneyland and Angel Stadium of Anaheim, along the Orange County portion of its route combines with a severe bottleneck beginning at the Los Angeles County line (shrinking from 10 to 6 lanes) to make it one of the most congested freeways in Southern California. The infamously busy intersection of the Santa Ana, Garden Grove, and Orange freeways in southwestern Orange is nicknamed the Orange Crush.

The freeway is officially defined as Routes 101 and 5 from Route 110 (Four Level Interchange) to Route 405.

==History==
The Santa Ana Freeway is a bypass of the original state highway from Los Angeles to Santa Ana, which passed through Whittier and mostly became SR 72 in the 1964 renumbering. Southeast of Santa Ana, this earlier highway, added to the state highway system in 1910 as Route 2, generally followed the present freeway from Tustin past East Irvine to El Toro. This route was marked as part of US 101 in 1928.

In 1933, the state legislature added a number of routes to the state highway system, including two that later formed parts of the Santa Ana Freeway. Route 166 began at the new Route 172 (now SR 60), at the corner of Indiana and Third Streets, and headed south on Indiana Street and east and southeast on Mines Avenue (Olympic Boulevard) and Anaheim-Telegraph Road (now Telegraph Road) to Route 171 (now SR 39) at the intersection with Los Nietos Road near Santa Fe Springs. Route 174 began at Route 60 (then signed Alternate U. S. 101 now SR 1) in what now is known as Westchester and followed Manchester Avenue and Firestone Boulevard (then under construction alongside the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Santa Ana Branch) to Route 2 (then Los Angeles Street, now Anaheim Boulevard) in southern Anaheim. A second piece began further southeast on Route 2, where it turned east on Chapman Avenue, and followed the shorter Santa Ana Boulevard diagonally to Route 2 (Main Street) in northern Santa Ana. In 1934, Route 166, except on Indiana Street, was marked as part of Sign Route 6 (which continued along Route 171 to Buena Park), and the entire length of Route 174 became Sign Route 10. (SR 6 was renumbered to SR 26 in 1937, when US 6 entered California; SR 10 was soon truncated to Anaheim Boulevard, as US 101 had moved from Route 2 to the shorter Route 174 in Santa Ana.)

A U.S. Route 101 Bypass was created by 1941, beginning at the intersection of Routes 166 (Indiana Street, soon moved to Downey Road) and 2 (US 101 along Whittier Boulevard), and following Routes 166 and 174 to Route 2 (US 101) in Anaheim. The connection between Routes 166 and 174 was made via Route 168 (Rosemead Boulevard, then and now SR 19). This resulted in SR 10 being truncated further, to the intersection of Firestone and Rosemead Boulevards, though SR 26 continued to extend east on Routes 166 and 171 to Buena Park.

A freeway connecting downtown Los Angeles with Orange County was planned by 1939, and was included in &quot;A Transit Program for the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area&quot;, published that year by the Metropolitan Transportation Engineering Board. To allow for its construction by the state, the definition of Route 166 was modified in 1941, changing the southeast end to Route 174 near Norwalk; at the same time, the northernmost piece was changed from Indiana Street to Downey Road.

The entire Santa Ana Freeway began construction in 1947 and completed in 1956. Originally it was signed as US 101 before the segment of 101 between the East Los Angeles Interchange and the United States–Mexico border in San Ysidro, California was decommissioned in favor of Interstate 5. It was approved as a chargeable interstate in 1961. The Santa Ana Freeway and also portions of San Diego Freeway (before the freeway was built) south of El Toro Y went up changing the U.S. 101 signs to Interstate 5 in 1964, including full length of Golden State Freeway which was originally signed as US 99.

===Former Interstate 105===
From 1964 to 1968, the I-105 designation was used on a stretch of road linking I-5/I-10, US 101, and SR 10 (former I-110) north of downtown Los Angeles, now known as the East Los Angeles Interchange. In 1968, this I-105 was decommissioned, and that portion of the Santa Ana Freeway was folded into US 101.

<text>Interstate 405 (I-405, locally referred to as The 405) is a major north–south auxiliary Interstate Highway in Southern California. The entire route is known as the northern segment of the San Diego Freeway. I-405 is a bypass auxiliary route of I-5, running along the southern and western parts of the Greater Los Angeles urban area from Irvine in the south to Sylmar in the north.

I-405, heavily traveled by both commuters and freight haulers along its entire length, is the busiest and most congested freeway in the United States. The freeway&#x27;s annual average daily traffic between exits 21 and 22 in Seal Beach reached 374,000 in 2008, making it the highest count in the nation. It has played a crucial role in the development of dozens of cities and suburbs along its route through Los Angeles and Orange counties. It also serves Los Angeles International Airport, Long Beach Airport, and Orange County&#x27;s John Wayne Airport.

==Route description==
The entirety of I-405 is designated as Route 405 in the state highway system. It is defined as follows in the California Streets and Highways Code&#x27;s section 615, subdivision (a):
Route 405 is from Route 5 near El Toro to Route 5 near San Fernando.
As of January 2025, subdivision (b) of section 615 designates the portion of Route 405 from Bolsa Chica Road to Bolsa Avenue in Orange County as the &quot;Little Saigon Freeway.&quot;

===Orange County===

I-405 begins at the El Toro Y interchange in southeastern Irvine in Orange County, splitting from its parent I-5 and inheriting that route&#x27;s San Diego Freeway title; I-5 continues north as the Santa Ana Freeway. The freeway passes immediately south of the Irvine Spectrum Center mall before intersecting with State Route 133 (SR 133). It then continues through Irvine, passing north of the University of California, Irvine, and then along the northern boundary of John Wayne Airport. After passing the airport, the freeway enters Costa Mesa and has an interchange with SR 55. It passes South Coast Plaza before a partial interchange with SR 73, which serves as a partially-tolled bypass of I-405 between Costa Mesa and Laguna Niguel.

The freeway then travels through Fountain Valley and along the edges of Westminster and Huntington Beach before entering Seal Beach, where it begins to run concurrently with SR 22. It continues along the northern edge of Seal Beach, passing between Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach and Joint Forces Training Base - Los Alamitos, before SR 22 splits from I-405 and continues west while the freeway turns north. I-405 then intersects the southern end of I-605 before crossing the San Gabriel River and entering Los Angeles County.

===Los Angeles County===
I-405 enters Los Angeles County in the city of Long Beach. It passes to the north of California State University, Long Beach, and then along the south of Long Beach Airport. The freeway then intersects with I-710 before entering Carson (and crossing through a small sliver of the city of Los Angeles before reentering Carson). It passes near California State University, Dominguez Hills, and Dignity Health Sports Park, home of Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy. A weigh station for both directions is located in Carson between the Avalon Boulevard and Main Street exits.
The freeway then intersects with I-110 as it briefly reenters the city of Los Angeles by passing through the Harbor Gateway, a strip of land connecting San Pedro to the rest of the city. I-405 then continues to roughly parallel the contour of the coastline as it passes through the South Bay communities of Torrance, Lawndale, Redondo Beach, Hawthorne, and El Segundo. The freeway then encounters I-105 on the southeastern corner of Los Angeles International Airport. It passes to the east of the airport, serving it with exits at the Imperial Highway and Century Boulevard.

I-405 next passes through Inglewood, coming near SoFi Stadium, home to the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League. It then passes through Westchester and Culver City where it meets SR 90, the Marina Freeway. It serves the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Mar Vista and West Los Angeles while passing a few miles east of Santa Monica, intersecting with I-10 in the process. The freeway continues into Westwood, passing just to the west of University of California, Los Angeles. It then passes the Getty Center as it ascends Sepulveda Pass through the Santa Monica Mountains.
After cresting the mountains, I-405 descends into the San Fernando Valley, intersecting US Route 101 (US 101) in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles. The freeway then continues due north through the western part of the valley, passing east of Van Nuys Airport and California State University, Northridge. It intersects SR 118 in the Mission Hills area before ending in a merge with I-5 in Sylmar.

I-405 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The entire freeway is known as the San Diego Freeway, and parts of it are less commonly known as the Sepulveda Freeway (after Sepulveda Boulevard).

==Express lanes==
High-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes along I-405 between SR 73 in Costa Mesa and I-605 in Seal Beach opened on December 1, 2023. This was part of the I-405 Improvement Project that started construction in March 2018. The project included converting the existing high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, with them closing in November to test the tolling equipment. In addition, two lanes were added in each direction, one toll lane and one general purpose lane, making the upgrade from five to seven lanes in each direction.

, the HOT lanes are a 24/7 service. Solo drivers are tolled using a congestion pricing system based on the real-time levels of traffic. For two-person carpools, they are charged the posted toll during weekday peak hours between 6:00 am and 10:00 am and between 3:00 pm and 8:00 pm and weekend peak hours between 1:00 pm and 6:00 pm; no toll would charged during off-peak hours until years after their opening. Carpools with three or more people and motorcycles are not charged. All tolls are collected using an open road tolling system, and therefore there are no toll booths to receive cash. Each vehicle using the HOT lanes is required to carry a FasTrak &quot;Flex&quot; transponder with its switch set to indicate the number of the vehicle&#x27;s occupants (1, 2, or 3+). Those with clean air vehicles need to apply to get a 15 percent discount. Solo drivers may also use the FasTrak standard tag without the switch. Drivers without any FasTrak tag will be assessed a toll violation regardless of whether they qualified for free.

==Traffic congestion==

The freeway is one of the busiest freeways in the nation and is the busiest freeway in California. The freeway&#x27;s congestion problems have led to jokes that the road was numbered 405 because traffic moves at &quot;four or five&quot; miles per hour (), or because drivers had spent &quot;four or five&quot; hours to travel anywhere. Indeed, average speeds as low as are routinely recorded during morning and afternoon commutes, and its interchanges with the Ventura Freeway (US 101) and with the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) each consistently rank among the five most congested freeway interchanges in the US. As a result of these congestion problems, delays passing through the entirety of Greater Los Angeles using this bypass route instead of merely using the primary route I-5 through Downtown Los Angeles may be present.

I-405 is the only major north–south freeway in the densely populated areas between West Los Angeles and Downtown Los Angeles, crossing the Santa Monica Mountains and connecting the San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles Basin. It is also a major connection for traffic en route to either the Port of Los Angeles, the Port of Long Beach, Los Angeles International Airport, or SoFi Stadium. By 2040, this corridor is estimated to increase by 35 percent and travel times reduced by 75 percent. The freeway&#x27;s West Los Angeles section is the subject of annual gridlock photos and videos taken during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, most often from an aerial view.

Another parallel freeway was proposed to connect the valley and basin (the Laurel Canyon Freeway or La Cienega Freeway) but has faced upper-class and NIMBY homeowner opposition. Despite four years of construction disruptions and billions of dollars of public money, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commentary claims traffic with the lane expansions is actually just as bad or worse. 

Unlike some of the other major travel corridors in the region (such as I-5 which parallels the LOSSAN Corridor), I-405 has no rail-based public transit which parallels it along the west side of Orange and Los Angeles counties. There is a proposal for a Sepulveda Transit Corridor which would parallel I-405 through Sepulveda Pass, one of the major bottlenecks on the route, which would ease congestion by providing an alternative to driving.

==History==

I-405 was approved as a chargeable Interstate (in other words, an Interstate financed with federal funds) in 1955. The Division of Highways originally requested I-9 for the corridor, while the Santa Ana Freeway would be I-11; I-3 was later requested in April 1958 before the Division of Highways agreed to use I-405. Construction began in 1957 with the first section, mostly north of Los Angeles International Airport, which was completed in 1961 and initially signed as SR 7. The section through Sepulveda Pass was dedicated on December 21, 1962, and cost $20 million to construct. It was designed with a maximum grade of 5.5 percent and required the relocation of Sepulveda Boulevard and the Mulholland Highway, which was moved to the south along a new bridge over the freeway. Additional sections west of Alameda Street were completed in 1962 and 1963, creating of continuous freeway.

The highway was renumbered to I-405 during the 1964 state highway renumbering. The Orange County portion of the San Diego Freeway took 13 years to construct, with the first section opening in 1958; The final section of I-405, leading to I-5 in Irvine, was dedicated on December 6, 1968, and opened to traffic in January 1969.

===&quot;Carmageddon&quot;===
A section of I-405 was closed over the weekend of Friday, July 15, 2011, as part of the Sepulveda Pass Improvements Project. Before the closing, local radio DJs and television newscasts referred to it as &quot;Carmageddon&quot; and &quot;Carpocalypse&quot;, parodying the notion of Armageddon and the Apocalypse, since it was anticipated that the closure would severely impact traffic. In reality, traffic was lighter than normal across a wide area. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) reported that fewer vehicles used the roads than usual, and those who did travel by road arrived more quickly than on a normal weekend. The Metrolink commuter train system recorded its highest-ever weekend ridership since it began operating in 1991. Ridership was 50 percent higher than the same weekend in 2010 and 10 percent higher than the previous weekend ridership record, which occurred during the U2 360° Tour in June 2011. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on Sunday, July 17, 2011, featured comments and images of people enjoying the moment next to the I-405 freeway with the free-flowing traffic.

In response to JetBlue&#x27;s offer of special flights between Hollywood Burbank Airport in Burbank and Long Beach Airport, a distance of only , for $4.00, a group of cyclists did the same journey in one and a half hours, compared to two and a half hours by plane (including a drive to the airport from West Hollywood 90 minutes in advance of the flight and travel time to the end destination). There was also some debate about whether the Los Angeles area could benefit from car-free weekends regularly.

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority then had full closure of a stretch of I-405 on the weekend of September 29–30, 2012, while construction crews worked to demolish a portion of the Mulholland Bridge.

Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, used the closure of I-405 to study particulate matter air pollution. The researchers took air samples before, during, and after the closure. The researchers found an 83-percent reduction in ultrafine particles, 55-percent reduction in fine particle matter, and 62-percent less black carbon.

===Sepulveda Pass Improvements Project===
The $1-billion Sepulveda Pass Improvements Project added a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane and associated changes to freeway entrances, exits, and underpasses along a stretch through Sepulveda Pass between I-10 and US 101/Ventura Boulevard. The project was completed as a design–build in contrast to the traditional design–bid–build used typically in infrastructure improvement. This section of I-405 was closed for a weekend in mid-July 2011 to demolish the Mulholland Drive Bridge, and a section was closed for the last weekend of September 2012.

Jamzilla was the name for the I-405 closure on Presidents&#x27; Day weekend 2014. There were lane closures and complete closures on I-405 starting February 14 at 10:00 pm until February 18 at 6:00 am to pave and restripe the northbound lanes.

On May 23, 2014, the HOV lane was opened to traffic.

==Future==
===Manchester and Century Boulevard interchanges===
Proposed changes between the Manchester and Century Boulevard interchanges in the city of Inglewood are to provide a new southbound onramp and a new northbound offramp for Arbor Vitae Street, to reconstruct and widened the Arbor Vitae Street over-bridge and replace the Century Boulevard overcrossing structure. This work would reduce congestion on the approach to Los Angeles International Airport. Caltrans has not yet issued a start date for this work.

===Sepulveda Pass express lanes===
The HOVs lane that were constructed as part of the Sepulveda Pass Improvements Project are proposed to be upgraded to express lanes by 2028.

<text>Skarns or tactites are coarse-grained metamorphic rocks that form by replacement of carbonate-bearing rocks during regional or contact metamorphism and metasomatism. Skarns may form by metamorphic recrystallization of impure carbonate protoliths, bimetasomatic reaction of different lithologies, and infiltration metasomatism by magmatic-hydrothermal fluids. Skarns tend to be rich in calcium-magnesium-iron-manganese-aluminium silicate minerals, which are also referred to as calc-silicate minerals. These minerals form as a result of alteration which occurs when hydrothermal fluids interact with a protolith of either igneous or sedimentary origin. In many cases, skarns are associated with the intrusion of a granitic pluton found in and around faults or shear zones that commonly intrude into a carbonate layer composed of either dolomite or limestone. Skarns can form by regional or contact metamorphism and therefore form in relatively high temperature environments. The hydrothermal fluids associated with the metasomatic processes can originate from a variety of sources; magmatic, metamorphic, meteoric, marine, or even a mix of these. The resulting skarn may consist of a variety of different minerals which are highly dependent on both the original composition of the hydrothermal fluid and the original composition of the protolith.

If a skarn has a respectable amount of ore mineralization that can be mined for a profit, it can be classified as a skarn deposit.

==Etymology==
&quot;Skarn&quot; is an old Swedish mining term originally used to describe a type of silicate gangue, or waste rock, associated with iron-ore bearing sulfide deposits apparently replacing Palaeoproterozoic age limestones in Sweden&#x27;s Persberg mining district.

==Petrology==
Skarns are composed of calcium-iron-magnesium-manganese-aluminum silicate minerals. Skarn deposits are economically valuable as sources of metals such as tin, tungsten, manganese, copper, gold, zinc, lead, nickel, molybdenum and iron.

A skarn is formed by a variety of metasomatic processes during metamorphism between two adjacent lithologic units. Skarns can form in almost any rock type such as shale, granite, or basalt but the majority of skarns are found in carbonate rocks containing limestone or dolomite. It is common to find skarns near plutons, along faults and major shear zones, in shallow geothermal systems, and on the bottom of the sea floor. The specific mineralogy of skarns are highly related to the mineralogy of the protolith.

Skarn mineralogy is dominated by garnet and pyroxene with a wide variety of calc-silicate and associated minerals, including idocrase, wollastonite, actinolite, magnetite or hematite, epidote and scapolite. Because skarns are formed from silica-rich aqueous fluids replete with incompatible elements, a variety of uncommon mineral types are found in skarns, such as: tourmaline, topaz, beryl, corundum, fluorite, apatite, barite, strontianite, tantalite, anglesite, and others.

==Classification==
Skarns can be subdivided depending on specific criteria. One way to classify a skarn is by its protolith. If the protolith is of sedimentary origin, it can be referred to as an exoskarn and if the protolith is igneous, it can be called an endoskarn.

Further classification can be made based on the protolith by observing the skarn&#x27;s dominant composition and the resulting alteration assemblage. If the skarn contains minerals such as olivine, serpentine, phlogopite, magnesium clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, spinel, pargasite, and minerals from the humite group, it is characteristic of a dolomitic protolith and can be classed as a magnesian skarn. The other class, called calcic skarns, are the replacement products of a limestone protolith with dominant mineral assemblages containing garnet, clinopyroxene, and wollastonite.

Rocks that contain garnet or pyroxene as major phases, and that are also fine-grained, lack iron, and have skarn-like appearances, are generally given the term &quot;skarnoid&quot;. Skarnoid is therefore the intermediate stage of a fine-grained hornfels and a coarse-grained skarn.

=== Skarn ore deposits ===
Metal ore deposits that have skarn as gangue are called skarn deposits and can form by any combination of closed metamorphism or open system metasomatism, although most skarn deposits are thought to be related to magmatic-hydrothermal systems. Skarn deposits are classified by their dominant economic element, e.g., a copper (Cu) skarn deposit or a molybdenum (Mo) skarn deposit.

===Fe (Cu, Ag, Au) skarn deposits===

The tectonic setting for calcic Fe skarns tends to be the oceanic island arcs. The host rocks tend to range from gabbro to syenite associated with intruding limestone layers. The tectonic setting for magnesium Fe skarns tends to be the continental margin. The host rocks tend to be granodiorite to granite associated with intruding dolomite and dolomitic sedimentary rocks. Magnetite is the principal ore in these types of skarn deposits which its grade yields from 40 to 60 %. Chalcopyrite, bornite and pyrite constitute minor ores.

===Cu (Au, Ag, Mo, W) skarn deposits===

The tectonic setting for Cu deposits tends to be the Andean-type plutons intruding older continental-margin carbonate layers. The host rocks tend to be quartz diorite and granodiorite. Pyrite, chalcopyrite and magnetite are typically found in higher abundances.

==Formation==
Generally, there are two types of skarns that form, exoskarns and endoskarns.

Exoskarns are more common and form on the outside of an intrusive body that comes into contact with a reactive rock unit. They are formed when fluids left over from the crystallisation of the intrusion are ejected from the mass at the waning stages of emplacement, in a process called boiling. When these fluids come into contact with reactive rocks, usually carbonates such as limestone or dolomite, the fluids react with them, producing alteration (infiltration metasomatism).

Endoskarns form within the intrusive body where fracturing, cooling joints, and stockworks have been produced, which results in a permeable area. This permeable area can be altered by fluids originally sourced from the intrusion itself, after interacting with surrounding rocks (protolith). Thus, both the composition and the textures of protoliths strongly play a role in the formation of the resulting skarn. Endoskarns are considered to be rare. 

Reaction skarns are formed from metamorphism occurring on thinly interlayered sedimentary units, via small-scale metasomatic exchange between adjacent units.

Skarnoids are calc-silicate rocks that are fine-grained and iron poor. Skarnoids tend to be found between hornfels and coarse-grained skarn. Skarnoids commonly reflect the composition of the protolith.

Most large skarn deposits experience a transition from early metamorphism—which forms hornfels, reaction skarns, and skarnoids—to late metamorphism, which forms relatively coarser grained, ore-bearing skarns. The magma intrusion triggers contact metamorphism in the surrounding region, forming hornfels as a result. The recrystallization and phase change of hornfels reflects the composition of the protolith. After the formation of hornfels, metasomatism occurs involving hydrothermal fluids from a source that is magmatic, metamorphic, marine, meteoric, or even a mix of these. This process is called isochemical metamorphism, and can result in the production of a wide range of calc-silicate minerals that form in impure lithology units and along fluid boundaries where small-scale metasomatism occurs (argillite and limestone, and banded iron formation).

The skarn deposits that are considered economically important for containing valuable metals are a result of large-scale metasomatism, where the composition of fluid controls the skarn and its ore mineralogy. They are relatively coarser grained and do not strongly reflect the composition of protolith or surrounding rocks.

Uncommon types of skarns are formed in contact with sulfidic or carbonaceous rocks such as black shales, graphite shales, banded iron formations and, occasionally, salt or evaporites. Here, fluids react less via chemical exchange of ions, but because of the redox-oxidation potential of the wall rocks.

==Ore deposits==
The major economic metals that are sourced from skarn deposits are copper, tungsten, iron, tin, molybdenum, zinc-lead, and gold. Other minor economic elements include uranium, silver, boron, fluorine, and rare-earth elements.

Some examples of the major economic skarn deposits, both current and historical, are:
* Iron skarns: Dashkesan Mine, Azerbaijan

* Copper skarns: Bingham Canyon Mine, Utah, U.S.A

* Tungsten skarns: Sangdong mine, South Korea

* Gold-bearing skarns: Hedley Mascot Mine, British Columbia, Canada

* Zinc-lead skarns: Santa Eulalia, Chihuahua, Mexico

* Nickel skarns: Avebury Mine, Zeehan, Tasmania (Australia)

* Molybdenum skarns: Yangchiachangtze mine, China

<doc id="467423" wikidata="Q14634108" url="?curid=467423" title="May you live in interesting times">
<text>&quot;May you live in interesting times&quot; is an English expression that is claimed to be a translation of a traditional Chinese curse. The expression is ironic: &quot;interesting&quot; times are usually times of trouble.

Despite being so common in English as to be known as the &quot;Chinese curse&quot;, the saying is apocryphal, and no actual Chinese source has ever been produced. The most likely connection to Chinese culture may be deduced from analysis of the late-19th-century speeches of Joseph Chamberlain, probably erroneously transmitted and revised through his son Austen Chamberlain.

==Origins==
Despite the phrase being widely attributed as a Chinese curse, there is no known equivalent expression in Chinese. The nearest related Chinese expression translates as &quot;Better to be a dog in times of tranquility than a human in times of chaos.&quot; () The expression originates from Volume 3 of the 1627 short story collection by Feng Menglong, &quot;Stories to Awaken the World&quot;.

Evidence that the phrase was in use as early as 1936 is provided in a memoir written by Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China in 1936 and 1937, and published in 1949. He mentions that before he left England for China in 1936, a friend told him of a Chinese curse, &quot;May you live in interesting times.&quot;

Frederic René Coudert Jr. also recounted having first heard the phrase in 1936:

Some years ago, in 1936, I had to write to a very dear and honoured friend of mine, who has since died, Sir Austen Chamberlain, brother of the present Prime Minister, and I concluded my letter with a rather banal remark &quot;that we were living in an interesting age&quot;. Evidently he read the whole letter, because by return mail he wrote to me and concluded as follows: &quot;Many years ago I learned from one of our diplomats in China that one of the principal Chinese curses heaped upon an enemy is, &#x27;May you live in an interesting age. &quot;Surely&quot;, he said, &quot;no age has been more fraught with insecurity than our own present time.&quot; That was three years ago.

The phrase is again described as a &quot;Chinese curse&quot; in an article published in &quot;Child Study: A Journal of Parent Education&quot; in 1943.

Research by philologist Garson O&#x27;Toole shows a probable origin in the mind of Austen Chamberlain&#x27;s father Joseph Chamberlain dating around the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Specifically, O&#x27;Toole cites the following statement Joseph made during a speech in 1898:

I think that you will all agree that &quot;we are living in most interesting times.&quot; (Hear, hear.) I never remember myself a time in which our history was so full, in which day by day brought us new objects of interest, and, let me say also, &quot;new objects for anxiety.&quot; (Hear, hear.) [emphasis added]

Over time, the Chamberlain family may have come to believe that the elder Chamberlain had not used his own phrase, but had repeated a phrase from Chinese.

==Trilogy==
The curse is sometimes presented as the first in a trilogy. Comedic author Terry Pratchett stated:
The phrase &quot;may you live in interesting times&quot; is the lowest in a trilogy of Chinese curses that continue &quot;may you come to the attention of those in authority&quot; and finish with &quot;may the gods give you everything you ask for.&quot; I have no idea about its authenticity.

==Use==
This phrase was used as a title for the 2019 edition of the Venice Biennale exhibition.

<text>Theodore &quot;Steve&quot; Brown (January 13, 1890September 15, 1965) was a jazz musician best known for his work on string bass. Like many New Orleans bassists, he played both string bass and tuba professionally.

Brown was the younger brother of trombonist Tom Brown. In his youth he played with his brother&#x27;s band in New Orleans. Because of his devil-may-care personality he was nicknamed &quot;Steve&quot; after Steve Brodie, a man who became famous for jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge on a dare. Few musicians knew Brown&#x27;s real name.

Brown went north to Chicago in 1915 with his brother Tom in the first wave of jazz musicians to go to the city. He was a member of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings in the early 1920s, where his slap style on bass attracted attention.

In 1924 he joined Jean Goldkette&#x27;s Orchestra, with whom he remained until 1927, creating the first recordings of the style. In 1927, he joined the top-paying band in the United States, Paul Whiteman&#x27;s Orchestra.

Around 1930 he settled in Detroit, Michigan, which would be his home for the rest of his life. He led his own band and continued playing with traditional jazz and Dixieland bands into the 1950s.

Wellman Braud, bass player with the Duke Ellington orchestra, once called Brown the greatest of all bass players.

<doc id="467428" wikidata="Q2394614" url="?curid=467428" title="Potential gradient">
<text>In physics, chemistry and biology, a potential gradient is the local rate of change of the potential with respect to displacement, i.e. spatial derivative, or gradient. This quantity frequently occurs in equations of physical processes because it leads to some form of flux.

==Definition==

===One dimension===

The simplest definition for a potential gradient &quot;F&quot; in one dimension is the following:

:formula_1

where is some type of scalar potential and is displacement (not distance) in the direction, the subscripts label two different positions , and potentials at those points, . In the limit of infinitesimal displacements, the ratio of differences becomes a ratio of differentials:

:formula_2

where is the electromagnetic vector potential. This last potential expression in fact reduces Faraday&#x27;s law to an identity.

===Fluid mechanics===

In fluid mechanics, the velocity field describes the fluid motion. An irrotational flow means the velocity field is conservative, or equivalently the vorticity pseudovector field is zero:

:formula_3

This allows the velocity potential to be defined simply as:

:formula_4

==Chemistry==

In an electrochemical half-cell, at the interface between the electrolyte (an ionic solution) and the metal electrode, the standard electric potential difference is:

:formula_5

where &quot;R&quot; = gas constant, &quot;T&quot; = temperature of solution, &quot;z&quot; = valency of the metal, &quot;e&quot; = elementary charge, &quot;N&quot;A = Avogadro constant, and &quot;a&quot;M+z is the activity of the ions in solution. Quantities with superscript ⊖ denote the measurement is taken under standard conditions. The potential gradient is relatively abrupt, since there is an almost definite boundary between the metal and solution, hence the interface term.

==Biology==

In biology, a potential gradient is the net difference in electric charge across a cell membrane.

==Non-uniqueness of potentials==

Since gradients in potentials correspond to physical fields, it makes no difference if a constant is added on (it is erased by the gradient operator which includes partial differentiation). This means there is no way to tell what the &quot;absolute value&quot; of the potential &quot;is&quot; – the zero value of potential is completely arbitrary and can be chosen anywhere by convenience (even &quot;at infinity&quot;). This idea also applies to vector potentials, and is exploited in classical field theory and also gauge field theory.

Absolute values of potentials are not physically observable, only gradients and path-dependent potential differences are. However, the Aharonov–Bohm effect is a quantum mechanical effect which illustrates that non-zero electromagnetic potentials along a closed loop (even when the and fields are zero everywhere in the region) lead to changes in the phase of the wave function of an electrically charged particle in the region, so the potentials appear to have measurable significance.

==Potential theory==

Field equations, such as Gauss&#x27;s laws for electricity, for magnetism, and for gravity, can be written in the form:

:formula_6

where is the electric charge density, monopole density (should they exist), or mass density and is a constant (in terms of physical constants , , and other numerical factors).

Scalar potential gradients lead to Poisson&#x27;s equation:

:formula_7

A general theory of potentials has been developed to solve this equation for the potential. The gradient of that solution gives the physical field, solving the field equation.

<text>The Bayshore Freeway is a part of U.S. Route 101 (US 101) in the San Francisco Bay Area of the U.S. state of California. It runs along the west shore of the San Francisco Bay, connecting San Jose with San Francisco. Within the city of San Francisco, the freeway is also known as James Lick Freeway, named after the California philanthropist. The road was originally built as a surface road, the Bayshore Highway, and later upgraded to freeway standards. Before 1964, it was mostly marked as U.S. Route 101 Bypass, with US 101 using the present State Route 82 (El Camino Real).

==Route description==
The Bayshore Freeway begins at the Blossom Hill Road interchange on US 101. The freeway curves north and northwest, bypassing downtown San Jose to the east, and then curves west-northwest, crossing I-880 and State Route 87, the latter just north of the San Jose International Airport. The portion of the highway from San Jose to South San Francisco is relatively straight and flat, running near the west edge of the San Francisco Bay. Junctions here include SR 237 in Sunnyvale, SR 85 in Mountain View, SR 84 in Menlo Park and Redwood City, SR 92 in San Mateo, and the San Francisco International Airport and I-380 in San Bruno. In South San Francisco, the freeway curves northeast around San Bruno Mountain, crossing its east edge at Sierra Point, and then heads north on a causeway across the former Candlestick Cove to the San Francisco city line.
In San Francisco, where the road is also known as the &quot;James Lick Freeway&quot;, it continues north-northwesterly between Bayview Park and McLaren Park, and crosses I-280 at the Alemany Maze. There it curves north-northeasterly around Bernal Heights and then northwest around Potrero Hill, meeting the Central Freeway at the border between the Mission District and South of Market. The Bayshore Freeway ends at the intersection of US 101 and Interstate 80, which, although signed as Interstate 80, is not officially Interstate 80 until the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. The freeway that goes from US 101 to the Bay Bridge that is signed as I-80 but not officially I-80 is called the &quot;San Francisco Skyway&quot;.

==History==
===Initial construction===
Before the Dumbarton and San Mateo-Hayward Bridges were built across the San Francisco Bay in the 1920s, San Francisco was bottled up at the north end of a long peninsula, with driving south on El Camino Real towards San Jose as the only reasonable alternative to the ferries for crossing the bay. The first of several highways built as an alternate to El Camino Real was the Skyline Boulevard, which was added to the state highway system in 1919. A second route, the Bay Shore Highway (Route 68), became a state highway in 1923, but only from the San Francisco city limits into San Mateo County, where the Dumbarton Bridge would begin. Just prior to the start of construction on the Dumbarton Bridge, San Francisco Supervisor Richard J. Welch noted that the Bay Shore Highway would need to be built all the way to San Jose as an escape valve for the additional traffic that the bridge would attract. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held in South San Francisco for the Bayshore Highway on September 11, 1924. The route used a right-of-way that was wide with a four-lane undivided highway wide.
The state legislature extended the highway in 1925, defining it to run from near the intersection of Army Street (Cesar Chavez Street) and San Bruno Avenue in San Francisco to a point in San Jose. The governor approved the bill with the stipulation that only the portion between the city limits of San Francisco and San Jose would be a state highway. Construction between South San Francisco and Burlingame had begun by 1924, funded by a $500,000 contribution from San Francisco, and was completed in 1928. A disconnected segment north of San Mateo was built by the state at the same time. It was not until February 1929 that the road was fully paved between San Francisco and Burlingame, and on October 20, 1929, the new highway was officially dedicated to San Mateo, several months after the connecting San Mateo-Hayward Bridge opened (at what is now Third Avenue). Even then, motorists had to wait until May 7, 1931, to reach Jefferson Avenue in Redwood City (near the west end of the four-year-old Dumbarton Bridge). The roadway was extended to Oregon Avenue in Palo Alto in mid-1932, Lawrence Station Road in mid-1933, and to Lafayette Street near Santa Clara, across the Guadalupe River from San Jose, by 1934. The final piece to Oakland Road (13th Street) in San Jose, which was then the main road - Legislative Route 5 and Sign Route 17 - between San Jose and Oakland, was dedicated on June 12, 1937, over ten years after the Dumbarton Bridge opened in January 1927.

Although the highway was designed and built to what were, at the time, high standards, with a 100-foot (30 m) wide right-of-way in most places, it was accident-prone because it lacked a median barrier. One segment of the so-called &quot;Bloody Bayshore&quot; was &quot;Boneyard Hill&quot;, a steep grade through the Visitacion Valley near the San Francisco city line, running past a bone meal plant. Causes of the crashes included turning conflicts at intersections, and speeding drivers crossing the centerline to use the oncoming lanes as a passing lane. The roadway was entirely at-grade except for crossings of rail lines. It generally followed the present alignment of the Bayshore Freeway, but deviated in several places: Old Bayshore Highway in San Jose, Veterans Boulevard in Redwood City, Bayshore Highway in Burlingame, a destroyed section of road through San Francisco International Airport, and Airport and Bayshore Boulevards from South San Francisco through Brisbane into San Francisco. Within that city, the new highway continued three miles (5 km) along the present Bay Shore Boulevard to Army (Cesar Chavez) Street and Potrero Avenue.

When the Bayshore Highway was completed in 1937, U.S. Route 101 signs were moved to it from El Camino Real, and El Camino became U.S. Route 101 Alternate. Businesses along El Camino created the El Camino Real Association to protest the move and resulting loss of business, and by 1939 the main route had been moved back, with the Bayshore Highway becoming U.S. Route 101 Bypass. The two routes split in San Jose at the junction of First and Second Streets near Keyes Street, with the El Camino route mostly following the present SR 82 and the Bayshore route using locally maintained Second, Reed, and Fourth Streets to reach the state-maintained Bayshore Highway. In San Francisco, they rejoined at the present location of the Alemany Maze, with the El Camino route following Alemany Boulevard from near the city line; from there US 101 continued north on Bay Shore Boulevard, Potrero Avenue, and 10th and Fell Streets to Van Ness Avenue, meeting the Bay Bridge approach (US 40/US 50) at Bryant and Harrison Streets. The Bryant/Harrison one-way pair was added to Route 68 (which already included the bridge) in 1937 and removed in 1947 along with the bridge; in 1961 the new freeway approach became part of Route 68, which was extended back over the bridge to Route 5 at its Oakland landfall.

Construction of an extension to Route 115 (Santa Clara Street, now SR 130) at 30th Street in San Jose began in 1939, and was completed by late 1940. As with the portion between Fourth and 13th Streets, it was not marked as a numbered route. The state legislature authorized an extension beyond San Jose back to El Camino Real near Ford Road in 1947, which was already under construction, and was completed that year. This was the first segment built with interchanges, and included a median barrier. Despite this, most crossings were at-grade; only the two ends at Route 115 (Santa Clara Street) and regular US 101 included bridges, the former a diamond interchange and the latter a simple split with additional access to Ford Road. It also crossed over Coyote Road, though with no access, just south of the Coyote Creek bridge. The original 1947 bridge over Coyote Road remains, though widened in 1990, and is one of the oldest road-road grade separations on the present freeway.

===Reconstruction===

The Bayshore Highway through San Francisco and San Mateo counties was considered complete in 1940, at the dawn of the freeway era; that year, the California Department of Public Works announced plans to convert the Bayshore Highway into a six-lane divided freeway between San Francisco and Palo Alto. It was the first freeway planned for Northern California, and the second in the state, after the Arroyo Seco project. In general, the goals of the Bayshore Freeway project were to grade-separate the freeway from surface streets and railroad tracks to accommodate projected traffic and to reduce the rate of accidents. At the time, it was anticipated that traffic along the San Francisco Peninsula would reach the capacity of both El Camino Real and the Bayshore Highway within ten years. In addition, the accident rate along the Bayshore Highway was 2.9 per million vehicle miles, compared with the state-wide average of 1.4; current traffic on the Bayshore Highway was estimated at 30,000 vehicles per day and in 1939 alone, there were 276 accidents, resulting in 19 fatalities and 235 injuries. Twenty years later in 1959, the accident rate on the new Bayshore Freeway had dropped to 0.75 per million vehicle miles, carrying 59,000 vehicles per day.
The first segment rebuilt as a modern freeway was finished in 1947, stretching from Peninsula Avenue (then called Peninsular) at the San Mateo-Burlingame line to Broadway Avenue in Burlingame, including the overpass for Peninsula. Contracts in 1948 and 1949 extended the freeway north to South San Francisco, a distance of . This segment converted the existing two-way traffic on Bayshore Highway to a single three-lane one-way road and added a new three-lane roadway running parallel to it. The new roadway, intended for northbound traffic, was constructed east of the existing alignment, separated by a wide median, permitting a future expansion to four lanes in each direction. This six-lane freeway followed the existing highway to Broadway in Burlingame, but then took a more inland alignment past the airport at Mills Field (now SFO), and crossed the old road at South San Francisco, running just east of it to near the south end of the cut at Sierra Point. The routing had been adjusted to the west to allow an additional for airport expansion. Since this segment was being constructed on predominantly marshy land, of fill was taken from the arm of San Bruno Mountain that extended into the water as Sierra Point; the hill was essentially levelled and the remaining fill was used for airport expansion.

Construction began in San Francisco in 1950 on a segment north from Augusta to 25th at a contracted cost of $6.5 million, including the cost of the right-of-way (about half the total) and grade separations over Alemany and Army. This segment opened on June 1, 1951. Also in 1951, the state legislature renamed the portion within San Francisco after James Lick, a California pioneer and philanthropist. San Francisco construction included segments to the north, opened in 1953, and the south. The connection to the upper deck of the Bay Bridge opened in June 1955. Construction in San Francisco was completed by 1958.
A new causeway across Candlestick Cove connected the completed section in South San Francisco with San Francisco and opened on July 11, 1957. Planning began in 1951, when bids were taken for an experimental causeway wide extending south from Candlestick Point; rather than pumping out soft bay mud and back-filling with sand, fill dirt would be dumped directly into the Bay to see if the mud underneath could be displaced instead. This section of the Bay had water up to deep, overlying soft mud deep, which in turn was overlying harder, compacted mud. The compacted mud was deemed sufficiently strong to support the weight of the freeway, but it was hoped that excavation of the soft mud layer could be avoided by dumping fill at a sufficient rate, later calculated to be per day. The experiment was deemed a success, and the remaining of causeway was put out for bid in 1954, awarded in 1955 to Guy F. Atkinson Co. By that time, over of fill had already been placed.

Meanwhile, construction had progressed south from San Mateo through San Carlos, with that segment completed in 1954, and continuing on into Redwood City (Marsh Road relocation, July 1958), Menlo Park (Willow Road Interchange, 1956), and Palo Alto (June 1958).

A movement to make the four-lane undivided &quot;Bloody Bayshore&quot; safer all the way to San Jose began in Palo Alto. As a temporary measure, the state lowered the speed limit, installed traffic signals, closed minor crossroads, and prohibited left turns in places. The community convinced the state to extend the six-lane freeway. Contracts for the projects in Santa Clara County had been awarded by 1959, and the Bayshore Freeway was completed to San Jose in 1962, officially opening on February 2 of that year. The total cost of freeway conversion was , including to acquire right-of-way. The south end of the freeway was the old El Camino Real merge near Ford Road until the early 1980s, when the South Valley Freeway was built.

<text>The Hollywood Freeway is one of the principal freeways of Los Angeles, California (the boundaries of which it does not leave) and one of the busiest in the United States. It is the principal route through the Cahuenga Pass, the primary shortcut between the Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley. It is considered one of the most important freeways in the history of Los Angeles and instrumental in the development of the San Fernando Valley. It is the second oldest freeway in Los Angeles (after the Arroyo Seco Parkway). From its southern end at the Four Level Interchange to its intersection with the Ventura Freeway in the southeastern San Fernando Valley (the Hollywood Split), it is signed as part of U.S. Route 101. It is then signed as State Route 170 (SR 170) north to its terminus at the Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5).

==Route description==

The freeway runs from the Four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles to the Golden State Freeway in the Sun Valley district of Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley. From the Four Level Interchange to its intersection with the Ventura Freeway in the southeastern San Fernando Valley (also known as the Hollywood Split), the freeway is signed as part of U.S. Route 101. Afterwards, it is signed as State Route 170 until its northern terminus at Interstate 5.

The intersection of the Hollywood, Santa Ana, and Harbor freeways and the Arroyo Seco Parkway, known as the Four Level Interchange, is one of the major landmarks in Los Angeles and a symbol of the city&#x27;s post-World War II development.

===California State Route 170===
As of the latest amendment on October 2, 2015, the California Streets and Highways Code defines Route 170 in section 470 as follows: Route 170 is from Route 101 near Riverside Drive to Route 5 near Tujunga Wash.

In addition to the above, the original 1963 definition of Route 170 included &quot;Route 405 near Inglewood to Route 101 in Los Angeles&quot; in a separate subdivision. This was defined in anticipation of the Laurel Canyon Freeway, which never came to fruition. In 1970, the definition was amended to subdivide the portion south of US 101 as &quot;(a) Los Angeles International Airport to Route 90.&quot; and &quot;(b) Route 2 to Route 101 in Los Angeles,&quot; deleting the segment between SR 2 and an extension of SR 90 that was never constructed. Subdivision b would run along Highland Avenue in Hollywood. In 2015, the state relinquished Highland Avenue to the city of Los Angeles, and the legislature amended the definition to reflect that as well as remove the final unconstructed freeway segment.

SR 170 begins its northbound route at the junction with the Ventura Freeway, continuing the freeway northwards. US 101 leaves the freeway, merging onto the Ventura Freeway and heads west. SR 134 continues the Ventura Freeway, heading east. On the southbound side, a sign indicates &quot;END Route 170&quot;. Curiously, there is no interchange from SR 134 west to US 101 south. This connector route was put on hold pending the construction of the Laurel Canyon Freeway. Motorists intending to go in that direction must exit SR 134 at Cahuenga Boulevard, make a left, continue on Lankershim Boulevard and follow the signs near Universal Studios to re-enter on US 101. Likewise, there is no interchange from US 101 north to SR 134 east. Motorists intending to go in that direction must exit US 101 at Vineland Avenue, make a right, make another right on Riverside Drive and enter SR 134 on the left. This interchange is also known as the &quot;Hollywood Split&quot;.

SR 170 then continues through the northeastern portion of the San Fernando Valley, finally merging onto northbound I-5. There is no connector route to I-5 south because the angle between the two freeways is too acute.

There are HOV lanes in operation 24 hours a day in each direction of SR 170 between I-5 and the Hollywood Split interchange. There is a direct connection from the northbound SR 170 HOV lanes onto the northbound I-5 HOV lanes, as well as from the southbound I-5 HOV lanes onto the southbound SR 170 HOV lanes. This makes it possible to connect with the I-5 HOV lanes as well as the SR 14 HOV lanes (from the I-5) without merging into regular lanes.

Both this portion of US 101 and the entirety of SR 170 are part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and are part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

As of 2018, Caltrans is planning to add soundwalls to SR 170 in both directions between Sherman Way and the Hollywood Split. There are currently some neighborhoods located near the freeway, which cause noise pollution. Now that soundwalls are in place, it can reduce the noise and reduces smog.

==History==
Plans for the Hollywood Freeway officially began in 1924 when Los Angeles voters approved a &quot;stop-free express highway&quot; between Downtown Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. The first segment of the Hollywood Freeway built was a one and a half mile stretch through the Cahuenga Pass. That segment opened on June 15, 1940. It was then known as the &quot;Cahuenga Pass Freeway&quot;. Pacific Electric Railway trolleys ran down the center of this freeway until 1952. The next section of the freeway that stretched from the San Fernando Valley to Downtown Los Angeles opened on April 16, 1954 at a cost of $55 million. The final section, north of the Ventura Freeway to the Golden State Freeway was completed in 1968.

A year after the Hollywood Freeway opened, it was used by an average of 183,000 vehicles a day, almost double the capacity it was designed to carry. Actor Bob Hope called it the &quot;biggest parking lot in the world&quot; in his routine.

The segment through Hollywood was the first to be built through a heavily populated area and requiring the moving or demolition of many buildings, including Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s former home in Whitley Heights. The freeway was also designed to curve around KTTV Studios and Hollywood Presbyterian Church. Much of the rubble and debris from the buildings removed for the freeway&#x27;s construction was dumped into Chávez Ravine, the current home to Dodger Stadium.

In 1967, the Hollywood Freeway was the first freeway in California that had ramp meters.

Near the Vermont Avenue exit, there&#x27;s a seemingly over-wide center strip now filled with trees. This is where the never-built Beverly Hills Freeway was to merge with the Hollywood Freeway. Plans for the Beverly Hills Freeway were halted in the 1970s.

The Hollywood Freeway is an expansion of the original Cahuenga Parkway, a short six-lane freeway that ran through the Cahuenga Pass between Hollywood and Studio City. The Cahuenga Parkway featured Pacific Electric Railway &quot;Red Car&quot; tracks in its median, but by the 1950s these tracks were out of service due to radical reductions in Red Car service. The Pacific Electric right-of-way later accommodated an additional lane in each direction.

The second location of Los Angeles High School was in the path of the freeway. The school moved to its third and current location in 1917. The school buildings were converted into a school for habitually truant boys until 1948, when it was demolished to make way for the freeway.

SR 170 was originally supposed to run from the I-5 interchange to I-405 near the Los Angeles International Airport as the Laurel Canyon Freeway under the Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Crescent Heights Boulevard and La Cienega Boulevard alignments of today. In fact, much of La Cienega Boulevard between Manchester Avenue and Venice Boulevard was constructed to freeway standards, with several grade-separated interchanges, although it is now an expressway maintained by Los Angeles County.

California&#x27;s legislature has relinquished state control of the segment of SR 170 along Highland Avenue, and thus that portion is now maintained by the City of Los Angeles. Despite the relinquishment, the exit numbers on SR 170 still correlate to when the route started at its junction with SR 2 (the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard and Highland Avenue), thus the route&#x27;s first exit northbound at Magnolia Boulevard is numbered as exit 6 instead of exit 1, while the last two southbound exits with SR 134 east and US 101 south are numbered as exits 5B and 5A instead of exits 1B and 1A, respectively (although as of 2022, signage has not yet been updated with exit numbers).

<text>The Ventura Freeway is a freeway in southern California, United States, that runs from the Santa Barbara/Ventura county line to Pasadena in Los Angeles County. It is the principal east–west route (designated north–south) through Ventura County and in the southern San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County. From the Santa Barbara County line to its intersection with the Hollywood Freeway in the southeastern San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles (the Hollywood Split), it is signed as [[Ventura Freeway|U.S. Route 101]] (US 101), which was built in the late 1950s and opened on April 5, 1960. The segments from the Santa Barbara County line to Sea Cliff, and from Solimar Beach to Oxnard, are also concurrent with State Route 1 (SR 1), although no signs mention SR 1 there. East of the Hollywood Freeway intersection, the Ventura Freeway is signed as State Route 134 (SR 134), which was built by 1971.

Before the construction of a new alignment in 1971, the portion east of the Golden State Freeway was known as the Colorado Freeway after nearby Colorado Boulevard, a historic thoroughfare in Pasadena and northeastern Los Angeles.

==Route description==
===U.S. Route 101===
The Ventura Freeway begins at the Santa Barbara/Ventura county line, west of La Conchita, as US 101. It travels eastward through the citrus orchards and strawberry fields of the Oxnard Plain before ascending the short, steep Conejo Grade into the Conejo Valley. Continuing eastward through the northern Santa Monica Mountains, it crosses the Ventura/Los Angeles county line before entering the San Fernando Valley. The freeway continues eastward along the valley&#x27;s southern rim, crossing the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405) near Sherman Oaks at an interchange consistently rated as one of the five most congested in the nation. It then reaches an interchange with the Hollywood Freeway known as the Hollywood Split. Here, the US 101 designation switches to the southeast-bound Hollywood Freeway, while the Ventura Freeway becomes SR 134 as it continues eastward. The northwest-bound portion of the Hollywood Freeway is designated as SR 170.

The westernmost portion of the freeway also forms part of the unsigned SR 1 concurrency that stretches from Las Cruces in the west to Oxnard in the east, with SR 1 spitting off for about to serve Sea Cliff, Faria, Solimar Beach, and Emma Wood State Beach. 

The portion of the Ventura Freeway signed as US 101 is signed as a north–south route by CalTrans despite the freeway&#x27;s actual alignment being east–west. This is due to the fact that US 101 as a whole has an overall north–south alignment. The apparent inconsistency can be confusing to visitors, as the same freeway entrance can often be signed as &quot;101 North&quot; and &quot;101 West.&quot; This is most common in the San Fernando Valley.

===California State Route 134===

Continuing eastward from the Hollywood Split as SR 134, the Ventura Freeway, now signed as east–west, skirts the northern edge of Griffith Park before intersecting the Golden State Freeway (I-5) and crossing the Los Angeles River. After passing through Downtown Glendale south of the Verdugo Mountains, it continues along the southern slope of the San Rafael Hills between Glendale and Eagle Rock before entering Pasadena near the Arroyo Seco and terminating at the Foothill Freeway (I-210).

The road is the main connector from the San Fernando Valley and points north to the San Gabriel Valley and points east. The future I-710 dead-ends at California Blvd and is signed as SR 710. Residents of South Pasadena have blocked efforts to extend I-710 north to California Boulevard from its current end at Valley Boulevard north of I-10 near the Alhambra/Los Angeles city limit. Signs on SR 134 and I-210 refer to the SR 710 stub in Pasadena as SR 110, because exiting left from the SR 710 stub onto California Blvd and turning right on Arroyo Parkway leads directly to SR 110, which is Pasadena&#x27;s only direct freeway link to Downtown Los Angeles.

Both the SR 134 and US 101 portions of the freeway are part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

==History==

===History of State Route 134===
A pre-freeway alignment of State Route 134 originated at U.S. Route 101 (Ventura Boulevard) and Fulton Avenue in Los Angeles, then along Fulton, Moorpark Street, Riverside Drive and Alameda Avenue before meeting up with U.S. 6/99 (San Fernando Road) in Burbank. It traveled along San Fernando Road to Colorado Street, then ran along Colorado Street (portions of which have been renamed Eagle Vista Drive) through Glendale, Eagle Rock and Pasadena before terminating at U.S. Route 66. The alignment was later cut back to terminate in Studio City at Lankershim and Ventura.

The Interstate 5 off-ramp at Colorado Street is actually a former routing of SR 134, and there are still mileposts that refer to it as such. Old SR 134 followed Colorado Street through Glendale and Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock to the ramp connecting Colorado Boulevard and Figueroa Street to the Ventura Freeway. Old SR 134 continued onto the ramp and then onto what is presently the Ventura Freeway to Orange Grove Boulevard in Pasadena. The Colorado Boulevard/Figueroa Street ramps plus the segment of freeway between the ramps and just east of Orange Grove Boulevard were previously known as the Colorado Freeway. 

From 1964 to 1992, the Colorado Boulevard portions of Route 134 were renumbered as California State Route 248.
==Legal definitions==

The official Ventura Freeway designation is Routes 101 and 134 from Route 5 to the Santa Barbara County line. This does not include the portion of Route 134 between Route 5 and Route 210 even though local usage extends the name over this portion of freeway. At the freeway&#x27;s eastern terminus with Interstate 210 in Pasadena, highway signs indicate &quot;Ventura&quot; as the destination direction for Route 134.

The interchange of SR 134 and I-5 is officially the &quot;Gene Autry Memorial Interchange&quot;, after the singing cowboy superstar Gene Autry. Autry&#x27;s Museum of the American West is located near the interchange in Griffith Park.

Assembly Concurrent Resolution 54, Chapter 85 in 2003 also designated Route 101 in Ventura County as the &quot;Screaming Eagles Highway&quot;. This honors the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army, which formed on July 23, 1918 and has been involved in every major war that the United States has participated in since then.

The California Legislature passed a resolution in 2017 to designate the easternmost segment of the SR 134 freeway between SR 2 and its terminus at I-210 as the &quot;President Barack H. Obama Highway&quot;, in honor of the 44th U.S. President Barack Obama, who had attended Occidental College in Eagle Rock from 1979 to 1981. Signs were posted on December 20, 2018.

==Projects==
The proposed Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing is a vegetated overpass spanning the Ventura Freeway and Agoura Road at Liberty Canyon in Agoura Hills. When built, it will be one of the largest urban wildlife crossing in the United States, connecting the Simi Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains over a busy freeway with ten traffic lanes (including exit lanes).&lt;ref name=&quot;VTD 2015/09/03&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Ventura Freeway currently carries the Los Angeles Metro express bus route 501 between Pasadena and North Hollywood. Portions of SR 134 are also being considered as part of a Bus Rapid Transit project.

==Exit list==
This exit list proceeds from east to west, since the majority of the freeway is the north-south US 101.

<doc id="467442" wikidata="Q7389090" url="?curid=467442" title="SCA (computer virus)">
<text>The SCA virus is the first computer virus created for the Amiga and one of the first to gain public notoriety. It appeared in November 1987. The SCA virus is a boot sector virus. It features a line of text that appears at every 15th copy after a warm reboot:
Something wonderful has happened Your AMIGA is alive !!! and, even better...

Some of your disks are infected by a VIRUS !!! Another masterpiece of The Mega-Mighty SCA !!
&quot;SCA&quot; is an acronym for the Swiss Cracking Association, a group engaged in software protection removal, so the geographic origin of the virus was Switzerland. The virus is probably authored by an SCA member known as &quot;CHRIS&quot;.

SCA will not harm disks per se, but spreads to any write-enabled floppies inserted. If they use custom bootblocks (such as games), they are rendered unusable. SCA also checksums as an original filesystem (OFS) bootblock, hence destroying newer filesystems if the user doesn&#x27;t know the proper use of the &quot;install&quot; command to remove SCA (&quot;install df0: FFS FORCE&quot; to recover a &#x27;fast filesystem&#x27; floppy).

The &quot;Mega-Mighty SCA&quot; produced the first Amiga virus checker which killed the SCA virus. This may well have been in response to estimates that approximately 40% of all Amiga users had SCA in their disk collection somewhere, due to rampant piracy and floppy disk sharing.

Other authors inspired by the harmless SCA virus would later produce more destructive viruses known as the Byte Bandit and the Byte Warrior.

The first line of the infection message refers to the 1986 movie Short Circuit and the subsequent computer game with the line &quot;Something wonderful has happened... No. 5 is alive.&quot;

<text>Rampart is a 1990 video game released by Atari Games and Midway Games that combines the shoot &#x27;em up, strategy, and puzzle genres. It debuted as an arcade game with trackball controls, and was ported to home systems. It had a limited US release in October 1990, and a wide release in early 1991. It was distributed in Japan by Namco.

&quot;Rampart&quot; is considered a precursor to the tower defense genre of the following decade.

==Gameplay==
The player controls and defends a territory consisting of a wall surrounding a set of castles and cannons. Gameplay alternates between two time-limited phases, combat and building. In the building phase, the player attempts to repair the damage from combat and expand their territory. In the combat phase, they attempt to damage the enemy with their cannons. In single-player games, the player fights against a fleet of attacking ships, in multi-player games, the players fight each other with rivers separating the sides.

The game opens with an automated building phase in which the computer builds a wall around one castle. The ownership of a castle grants the player control over a number of cannons, and after building the wall the game enters a phase in which the user places the cannons within their controlled territory.

When the building phase ends, combat begins. In single-player mode, the player is attacked by a number of ships that approach the player&#x27;s territory while firing cannons at their walls. The player responds by firing their cannons at the moving ships; the relatively slow speed of the cannonballs requires the player to &quot;lead&quot; their targets. In multi-player mode, the players shoot at each other&#x27;s walls. The goal of the attacker in both cases is to make holes in the walls. Combat ends when the user sinks a certain number of ships, or in two-player, after a set time.

When combat ends, the player loses control of any area that is no longer fully surrounded by their wall, along with any cannons in that area. A user-controlled building phase then begins. Shapes like those from Tetris appear and the player moves and rotates them with the goal of placing them so that they close gaps in the existing wall or extend the wall around additional castles.

When the tile placement phase time ends, any castle or cannon that is completely enclosed by a continual wall is added to the player&#x27;s territory. Afterwards, the cycle repeats with cannon placement again. Each surrounded castle awards the player with one cannon during each arming phase (the home castle grants two) but only if there is space.

Because the damage caused during the combat phase is normally spread out, repairing it can be difficult. The blocks are generally larger than the gaps (although one-unit blocks do appear sometimes) and filling the gaps often requires a large block to fill a small gap. The leftover extra bits of the block become barriers to the placement of future blocks, making it increasingly difficult to fix the damage as the larger blocks may not fit into the block-free area.

The player loses when they fail to have at least one surrounded castle after the tile placement phase. In single-player games, there is a fixed set of six levels, and in two player modes if both players survive the one with the higher score is declared the winner. If the player defeats the opponent, the player can execute the commander, by walking the plank or beheading. Cannons can be destroyed, bonus squares give extra points when captured, and when there are no grunts or craters.

== Ports ==
&quot;Rampart&quot; has been ported to the Super NES, Master System, Mega Drive/Genesis, Atari Lynx, MS-DOS, Macintosh, Commodore 64, Amiga, and Atari ST. Separate versions were made for Game Boy, Game Boy Color, NES, and Famicom. The NES, Super NES, and MS-DOS versions were all done by Bitmasters, and the NES version was planned for publication by Tengen (without a Nintendo license), but was switched to Jaleco (which was granted a Nintendo license), and the Super NES and MS-DOS versions were published by Electronic Arts. Most of the home versions have updated features. The Japanese Famicom version, which was released by Konami, includes 7 training levels, 3 difficulty settings, and an extensive two-player mode. The Famicom port was given an unofficial English translation in May 2017.

In the Super NES and MS-DOS versions, the cannons gained can also be converted into powerups.

The arcade version is part of the &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot; compilation for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PlayStation Portable, and of the &quot;Midway Arcade Origins&quot; compilation for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is bundled in a dual pack with &quot;Gauntlet&quot; for the Game Boy Advance. A PlayStation 3 version with Internet multiplayer mode was released on the PlayStation Network on May 10, 2007.

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Rampart&quot; in the June 1, 1991, issue as the seventh most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

Julian Rignall of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewed the arcade game, giving it a 93% score.

&quot;MegaTech&quot; gave the Mega Drive version 90% and a Hyper Game Award, saying that it was a &quot;superb blend of different game styles&quot;. &quot;Console XS&quot; reviewed the Master System version, giving it an 81% score. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; placed it the fourth best Game Boy Game of 1993.

==Legacy==
&quot;Rampart&quot; influenced the first tower defense games around a decade later. Gameplay similarities include defending a territory by erecting defensive structures, and making repairs between multiple rounds of attacks.

<text>Thessaloniki Airport , officially Thessaloniki Airport &quot;Makedonia&quot; () and formerly Mikra Airport, is an international airport serving Thessaloniki, the second-largest city in Greece. It is located southeast of the city, in Thermi.

The airport is the third-largest airport in the country after Athens International Airport and Heraklion International Airport. It opened in 1930 and was the second-busiest airport in Greece in terms of flights served and the third-busiest in terms of passengers served in 2016, with over 6 million passengers. It is the main airport of Northern Greece and apart from the city of Thessaloniki it also serves the popular tourist destination of Chalkidiki and the surrounding cities of Macedonia. The AthensThessaloniki route is the tenth busiest in the EU with 1.8 million passengers. To cope with demand, a second terminal was constructed in conjunction with Fraport and formally opened in 2021.

==History==
The airport was first established as an airfield during the First World War, as part of the allied war effort on the Macedonian front. There were numerous airfields at the time, including , (which became the current international airport), and the major military airfield of Sedes. The first international flight to Thessaloniki landed at the air field, and government efforts at encouraging the growth of civil aviation saw the start of construction of a purpose-built civilian airport at the present location in 1938. Works were temporarily abandoned due to the Second World War and the airport opened to civilian traffic in 1948.

Major works were undertaken after the war. The accession of Greece to North Atlantic Treaty Organisation saw NATO-funded investments such as the expansion of the 10/28 runway to and the inauguration of a new terminal building in 1965. Damage to the tower caused by the 1978 Thessaloniki earthquake meant it needed to be torn down, and a new tower, still in operation, was built. Modernisation works were undertaken in the late 1990s, as part of the celebrations for Thessaloniki being European Capital of Culture in 1997. In 1993 the airport took the name (, Macedonia).

The operational aspects of the airport were privatised in 2015. Fraport AG/Copelouzos Group joint venture and the state privatisation fund agreed to the privatisation of the airport operations, and 13 other Greek airports, in December 2015. Fraport Greece will operate the airport for 40 years starting on 11 April 2017. It pledged to invest €400 million ($ million) on the various airports, including a refurbishment of the existing facilities at Thessaloniki as well as the construction of a second terminal. Construction on the new terminal began on 19 September 2018 and finished in February 2021, three months ahead of schedule. Refurbishment works other than the terminal included the installation of an upgraded baggage handling system, the construction of three additional baggage reclaim belts, the connection of the wastewater treatment plant to the municipal service, the construction of a new airport fire station, and the construction of two new access control gatehouses to the previously unguarded apron. Fraport expects passenger traffic to increase by 48% by 2026 as a result of its investment.

==Facilities==
=== General ===
The airport consists of two terminals arranged in a T-shape, with the main access road on one side and the tarmac on the other, while the control tower is located in the junction between the two terminals. Four parking lots are located directly in front of the Terminal 1 building: the P4 lot is reserved for short term (visitor) parking and lots P6, P7 and P8 are used for long term (traveler) parking. P5, located on the left of the T1 building, serves taxi cabs and tourist buses.

=== Terminals ===

The airport&#x27;s original terminal (T1) consists of three floors. The ground floor serves arrivals only and is divided into two sections: international/extra-Schengen arrivals and domestic/intra-Schengen arrivals. The second floor serves departures and also includes a shopping center. On this floor there are 16 check-in counters, waiting areas, bars, stores and various airlines&#x27; offices. The third floor houses two restaurants and several bars with views to the runways, as well as two passenger lounges. T1 houses twelve departure gates (numbered 13-24) : gates 13 and 14 are for domestic or intra-Schengen flights, gates 15-18 are used interchangeably for either domestic, intra-Schengen or extra-Schengen flights, and gates 19-24 are reserved exclusively for extra-Schengen international flights.

An additional terminal (T2) was opened in the beginning of 2021. It includes an additional 28 check in counters (bringing the airport total to 44), and twelve departure gates (numbered 01-12) for international (intra-Schengen) and domestic flights. This terminal also includes several additional duty-free shops, traditional souvenir and jewelry shops, and auxiliary airline offices.

In both terminals, passengers can use the &quot;Fraport-free&quot; free Wi-Fi and public mobile phone charging ports, as well as luggage carrying trolleys, and receive information from two National Tourism Organization offices. There are also ATM machines, postal service and car rental offices in the departure sections of both terminals.

===Runways and apron===
The airport has two runways (10/28 and 16/34) and two taxiways. There are 22 stands for narrow-body aircraft and 20 for light aircraft.

A modernisation and expansion project for runway 10/28 began in 2005, with an initial completion date of 2011, but has since been delayed and was finally completed in March 2019. The runway entered service on 11 September 2020. Overall, the project took almost a quarter century to build, from inception in 1997, and it had an estimated cost of €179 million ($ million). The runway was extended by 1000 meters into the sea, with a total length of 3440 meters and was equipped with ILS. When the runway opened for commercial use it was able to accommodate 89.6% of current commercial aircraft types, as opposed to just 22.6% before the extension, and improved safety while landing in bad weather conditions and low visibility.

=== Fire station ===
The airport is served by Thessaloniki Fire Station No 5, whose facility is located in the junction between runways 10/28 and 16/34.

=== Other facilities ===
The Thessaloniki AeroClub recreational flying club maintains a hangar next to the T2 building which is used by its more experienced pilots (the club&#x27;s actual hangar facilities are on the Kolchiko airport). The Aeolus pilot academy also operates on the airport.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Thessaloniki Airport:

==Statistics==

===Overview===

== Transport ==
The airport is directly connected with the city&#x27;s major road arteries in the southeast, the EO16 and the A25 motorway, which connects Thessaloniki with Chalkidiki, via the ΕΟ67. The Thessaloniki Inner Ring Road provides access to the A1 (E75) and the A2 (E90) motorways. A total of 2,285 parking spaces for cars exist at the front of the terminal building. A car rental service is available at the terminal building. In addition, taxi services are available outside the airport terminal building 24 hours a day.

=== Public transport ===
There are plans to connect the airport with the Thessaloniki Metro. Elliniko Metro, the company overseeing the project, has published a map of proposed extensions, and it includes an overground extension of Line 2 towards the airport. This extension is not an immediate concern for the company, however, since the terminus of Line 2, , will be connected with the airport by a 10-minute shuttle bus. Detailed planning of the metro extension toward the airport was initiated in March 2019. For now, the airport is connected with the Line 1 of the system at with a shuttle bus, with the number 02X.

In the meantime, the airport is served on a 24-hour basis by bus 01X/01N of the Thessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (OASTH), which provides bus services between the Thessaloniki Bus Station (KTEL) and Makedonia airport arrivals/departures.

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 31 August 1995, a Mali Air Force Antonov An-26 after an attempted go-around crashed into a mountain 2.5 miles from SKG during an ILS approach to the airport in poor weather. All 6 occupants were killed.
*On 12 August 1997, Olympic Airways Flight 171, a Boeing 727-230 registered as SX-CBI inbound from Athens Ellinikon Airport, touched down late and was steered off the runway to avoid overrunning into the sea. None of the 35 passengers and crew were killed, but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
*On 17 December 1997, Aerosvit Flight 241, a Yakovlev Yak-42, operating the route from Odesa, Ukraine to Thessaloniki, lost contact with the airport&#x27;s air traffic control and during the second attempt the aircraft crashed in the Pierian Mountains, near Mount Olympus. A total of 70 people, passengers and crew, 41 of which were Greeks, were killed.
*On 4 July 2000, HA-LCR, a chartered Malév Flight 262 Tupolev Tu-154 landed on its belly. The crew had forgotten to lower the undercarriage and the plane skidded on the runway. Thanks to the plane&#x27;s robust construction and the engines&#x27; high position, the plane was able to become airborne again as the pilots applied full throttle. It circled while the crew lowered the undercarriage and landed safely. There were no injuries. It was considered uneconomical to repair the aircraft. The aircraft still remains on site, although airline markings have been obscured and it has been heavily depleted of re-usable spares.
*On 15 June 2013, an AMC Airlines Boeing 737-800 on behalf of Astra Airlines Greece, registration SU-BPZ performing flight A2-921 from Novosibirsk (Russia) to Thessaloniki (Greece) with 160 passengers, landed on Thessaloniki&#x27;s runway 16 at about 07:14L (04:14Z) but overran the end of the runway by about 110 meters/360 feet and came to a stop with all gear on soft ground. No injuries occurred, the aircraft received minor if any damage.

<text>Mikhail Nikolayevich Tukhachevsky (; – 12 June 1937), nicknamed the [[Red Napoleon]], was a Soviet general who was prominent between 1918 and 1937 as a military officer and theoretician. He was later executed during the Moscow trials of 1936–1938.

He served as an officer in World War I of 1914–1917 and in the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923, leading the defense of the Moscow district (1918), commanding forces on the Eastern Front (1918), commanding the Fifth Army in the recapture of Siberia from Alexander Kolchak, and heading Cossack forces against Anton Denikin (1920). From 1920 to 1921 he commanded the Soviet Western Front in the Polish–Soviet War. Soviet forces under his command successfully repelled the Polish forces from Western Ukraine, driving them back into Poland, but the Red Army suffered defeat outside of Warsaw, and the war ended in a Soviet defeat. Tukhachevsky blamed Joseph Stalin for his defeat at the Battle of Warsaw.

He later served as chief of staff of the Red Army from 1925 to 1928, as assistant in the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Defense after 1934 and as commander of the Volga Military District in 1937. He achieved the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1935.

As a major proponent of modernisation of Soviet armament and army force structure in the 1920s and 1930s, he became instrumental in the development of Soviet aviation, and of mechanized and airborne forces. As a theoretician, he was a driving force behind the Soviet development of the theory of deep operations in the 1920s and 1930s. Soviet authorities accused Tukhachevsky of treason, and after he confessed during torture, he was executed in 1937 during the military purges of 1936–1938, led by Stalin and Nikolai Yezhov.

== Early life ==

Tukhachevsky was born at Alexandrovskoye, Safonovsky District (in the present-day Smolensk Oblast of Russia), into a family of impoverished hereditary nobles. Legend states that his family descended from a Flemish count who ended up stranded in the East during the Crusades and took a Turkish wife before settling in Russia. His great-grandfather Alexander Tukhachevsky (1793–1831) served as a colonel in the Imperial Russian Army. He was of Russian ethnicity. After attending the Cadet Corps in 1912, he moved on to the , where he graduated in 1914.

==World War I==
At the outset of the First World War, he joined the Semyenovsky Guards Regiment (July 1914) as a second lieutenant, declaring:

I am convinced that all that is needed in order to achieve what I want is bravery and self-confidence. I certainly have enough self-confidence... I told myself that I shall either be a general at thirty, or that I shall not be alive by then.

Taken prisoner by the Imperial German Army in February 1915, Tukhachevsky escaped four times from prisoner-of-war camps and was finally held as an incorrigible escapee in Ingolstadt fortress in Bavaria.

=== Captivity in Ingolstadt ===
Fluent in French, there he met journalist Remy Roure and shared a cell with Captain Charles de Gaulle. Tukhachevsky played his violin, assailed nihilist beliefs and spoke against Christians and Jews, whom he called dogs who &quot;spread their fleas throughout the world&quot;. Later in various works he made Russians familiar with De Gaulle&#x27;s military thinking. Roure, under the pseudonym of Pierre Fervacque, wrote about his encounter with Tukhachevsky. He reported that Tukhachevsky highly praised Napoleon, and also in a certain conversation, Tukhachevsky said he hated Jews for bringing Christianity and the &quot;morality of capital&quot; to Russia. Roure then asked him if he was a socialist, and he replied:

According to Roure, Tukhachevsky said that he would follow Lenin only if he &quot;de-europeanised and threw Russia into barbarism&quot;, but feared Lenin would not do that. After ranting about how he could use Marxism as a justification to secure the territorial aims of the tsars and cement Russia&#x27;s position as a world power, he laughed and said he was only joking. Roure said the laugh had an ironic and despairing tone.

On another occasion, following the February Revolution, Roure observed Tukhachevsky carving a &quot;scary idol from colored cardboard&quot;, with &quot;burning eyes&quot;, a &quot;gaping mouth&quot;, and a &quot;bizarre and terrible nose&quot;. He inquired about its purpose, to which Tukhachevsky responded:

Tukhachevsky&#x27;s apparent neopaganism was also corroborated by another prisoner at Ingolstadt, , who recalled that he once saw a &quot;scarecrow&quot; in the corner of Tukhachevsky&#x27;s cell, and upon asking him as to what it was, Tukhachevsky responded (to what Tsurikov interpreted as heavy sarcasm), that it was an effigy of Yarilo (the Slavic god of vegetation, fertility and springtime), which he had created during Shrovetide.

Tukhachevsky never denied and later even confirmed those stories about his imprisonment in Germany, but always said that he was politically immature in 1917 and greatly regretted his early views. In France 1936, when confronted with what Roure wrote about him, he said that he had read his book and stated the following:I was still very young... a novice at politics, and all I knew about revolutions was the last phase of the citizens&#x27; revolution in France: the Bonapartism whose military triumphs filled me with boundless admiration. (...) I never think of my views at Ingolstadt without regretting them, since they could cause doubts about my devotion to the Soviet motherland. I&#x27;m taking advantage of our reunion to tell you my true feelings.Whether or not Tukhachevsky really gave up on his old views, the assertion that he was a fully-fledged Bolshevik by the time he joined them is considered to be most likely not true.

Tukhachevsky&#x27;s fifth escape met with success, and after crossing the Swiss-German border and carrying with him some small pagan idols, he returned to Russia in September 1917. After the October Revolution in 1917, Tukhachevsky joined the Bolsheviks and went on to play a key role in the Red Army despite his noble ancestry.

==Russian Civil War==

He became an officer in the newly-established Red Army and rapidly advanced in rank because of his great ability. During the Russian Civil War, he was given responsibility for defending Moscow. The Bolshevik Defence Commissar, Leon Trotsky, gave Tukhachevsky command of the 5th Army in 1919, and he led the campaign to capture Siberia from the anticommunist White forces of Aleksandr Kolchak. Tukhachevsky used concentrated attacks to exploit the enemy&#x27;s open flanks and threaten them with envelopment. According to Tukhachevsky&#x27;s close confidant Leonid Sabaneyev, when Tukhachevsky was in the service of the Military Department of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee in 1918, in his last overt display of neopaganism, Tukhachevsky drew up a project for destruction of Christianity and restoration of Slavic paganism. To that end, Tukhachevsky submitted a memo on declaring paganism as the state religion of Soviet Russia, which although mocked, also received some serious discussion in the Small Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, which commended Tukhachevsky for his &quot;joke&quot; and his commitment to atheism. Sabaneyev observed that Tukhachevsky seemed &quot;as happy as a schoolboy who had just succeeded in a prank.&quot;

He also helped defeat General Anton Denikin in the Crimea in 1920 in conducting the final operations. In February 1920, he launched an offensive into the Kuban and used cavalry to disrupt the enemy&#x27;s rear. In the retreat that followed, Denikin&#x27;s force disintegrated, and Novorossiysk was evacuated hastily.

In the final stage of the civil war, Tukhachevsky commanded the 7th Army during the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion in March 1921. He also commanded the assault against the Tambov Republic between 1921 and 1922.

==Polish-Soviet War==

Tukhachevsky commanded the Soviet invasion of Poland during the Polish-Soviet War in 1920. In the lead-up to hostilities, he concentrated his troops near Vitebsk, which he theatrically dubbed, &quot;The Gates of Smolensk&quot;. When he issued his troops orders to cross the border, Tukhachevsky said, &quot;The fate of world revolution is being decided in the west: the way leads over the corpse of Poland to a universal conflagration... On to Wilno, Minsk, and Warsaw – forward!&quot;

According to Richard M. Watt, &quot;The boldness of Tukhachevsky&#x27;s drive westward was the key to his success. The Soviet High Command dispatched 60,000 men as reinforcements, but Tukhachevsky never stopped to let them catch up. His onrushing armies were leaving behind greater numbers of stragglers every day, but Tukhachevsky ignored these losses. His supply services were in chaos and his rear scarcely existed as an organized entity, but Tukhachevsky was unconcerned; his men would live off the land. On the day his troops captured Minsk, a new cry arose – &#x27;Give us Warsaw!&#x27; Tukhachevsky was determined to give them what they wanted. All things considered, Tukhachevsky&#x27;s performance was a virtuoso display of energy, determination, and, indeed, rashness.&quot;

His armies were defeated by Józef Piłsudski outside Warsaw. It was during the Polish war that Tukhachevsky first came into conflict with Joseph Stalin. Both blamed each other for the Soviet failure to capture Warsaw. Tukhachevsky later lamented:

His book about the war was translated into Polish and published, together with a book by Piłsudski.

==Reform of the Red Army==

Tukhachevsky fervently criticised the Red Army&#x27;s performance during the 1926 Summer manoeuvres. He criticised the officers&#x27; inability to determine what course of action to take and communicate that with their troops especially harshly. Tukhachevsky noted that initiative among officers was lacking, that they responded slowly to changes in the situation and that communication was poor. That was not purely the officers&#x27; fault, as the only way of communication from local unit headquarters to the field positions was a single telephone line. In contrast, German divisions that mobilised shortly after during the interwar period had telephones, radio, horse, cycle and motorcycle messengers, signal lights and flags and pieces of cloth, and messages were conveyed mostly to aircraft.

Tukhachevsky reached the position of First Deputy Commissar for defence to Defence Commisar Kliment Voroshilov. Voroshilov disliked Tukhachevsky and would later be one of the initiators of the Great Purge in which Tukhachevsky was executed. According to Georgy Zhukov, it was Tukhachevsky, not Voroshilov, who ran the ministry in practice. Voroshilov disliked Tukhachevsky, but his perception of military doctrine was impacted significantly by Tukhachevsky&#x27;s ideas.

According to Simon Sebag Montefiore, Stalin regarded Tukhachevsky as his most bitter rival and dubbed him &quot;Napoleonchik&quot; (little Napoleon). Upon Stalin&#x27;s ascension to the party leadership in 1929, he began receiving denunciations from senior officers who disapproved of Tukhachevsky&#x27;s tactical theories. In 1930, the Joint State Political Directorate forced two officers to testify that Tukhachevsky was plotting to overthrow the Politburo via a coup d&#x27;état.

According to Montefiore:

Tukhachevsky later wrote several books on modern warfare, In 1931, after Stalin had accepted the need for an industrialized military, Tukhachevsky was given a leading role in reforming the army. Tukhachevsky held advanced ideas on military strategy, particularly on the use of tanks and aircraft in combined operations.

Tukhachevsky took a keen interest in the arts and became a political patron and close friend of the composer Dmitri Shostakovich; they met in 1925 and subsequently played music together at Tukhachevsky&#x27;s home (Tukhachevsky played the violin). In 1936, Shostakovich&#x27;s music was under attack after &quot;Pravda&quot; denounced his opera &quot;Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk&quot;. However, Tukhachevsky intervened with Stalin on his friend&#x27;s behalf. After Tukhachevsky&#x27;s arrest, pressure was put on Shostakovich to denounce him, but Shostakovich was saved from doing so by the fact that the investigator was himself arrested.

==Theory of deep operation==
Tukhachevsky is often credited with the theory of deep operation in which combined arms formations strike deep behind enemy lines to destroy the enemy&#x27;s rear and logistics, but his exact role is unclear and disputed because of shortage of firsthand sources, and his published works containing only limited amounts of theory on the subject. The theories were opposed by some in the military establishment but were largely adopted by the Red Army in the mid-1930s. They were expressed as a concept in the Red Army&#x27;s &quot;Field Regulations of 1929&quot; and more fully developed in the 1935 &quot;Instructions on Deep Battle&quot;. The concept was finally codified into the army in 1936 in the &quot;Provisional Field Regulations of 1936&quot;. An early example of potential effectiveness of deep operations can be found in the Soviet victory over Japan at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol in which a Soviet Corps under the command of Zhukov defeated a substantial Japanese force in August and September 1939 in Nomonhan.

It is often stated that the widespread purges of the Red Army officer corps in 1937 to 1939 made &quot;deep operation&quot; briefly fall from favour. However, it was certainly a major part of Soviet doctrine after its efficacy was demonstrated by the Battle of Khalkin Gol and the success of similar German operations in Poland and France. The doctrine was used with great success during World War II on the Eastern Front in such victories as the Battle of Stalingrad and Operation Bagration.

==Fall and death==

On November 20, 1935, Tukhachevsky was made a Marshal of the Soviet Union when he was 42. In January 1936, Tukhachevsky visited the United Kingdom, France and Germany.

Just before his arrest, Tukhachevsky was relieved of duty as assistant to Marshal Voroshilov and was appointed military commander of the Volga Military District. Shortly after departing to take up his new command, he was secretly arrested on May 22, 1937, and brought back to Moscow in a prison van.

Tukhachevsky&#x27;s interrogation and torture were directly supervised by NKVD Chief Nikolai Yezhov. Stalin instructed Yezhov, &quot;See for yourself, but Tukhachevsky should be forced to tell everything... It&#x27;s impossible he acted alone&quot;.

According to Montefiore, a few days later, as Yezhov buzzed in and out of Stalin&#x27;s office, a broken Tukhachevsky confessed that Avel Yenukidze had recruited him in 1928 and that he was a German agent co-operating with Nikolai Bukharin to seize power. Tukhachevsky&#x27;s confession, which survives in the archives, is dappled with a brown spray that was later found to be blood-spattered by a body in motion.
Stalin commented, &quot;It&#x27;s incredible, but it&#x27;s a fact, they admit it&quot;.

On June 11, 1937, the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union convened a special military tribunal to try Tukhachevsky and eight generals for treason. The trial was dubbed the Case of the Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization. Upon hearing the accusations, Tukhachevsky was heard to say, &quot;I feel I&#x27;m dreaming&quot;. Most of the judges were also terrified. One was heard to comment, &quot;Tomorrow I&#x27;ll be put in the same place&quot;.

At 11:35 that night, all of the defendants were declared guilty and sentenced to death. Stalin, who was awaiting the verdict with Yezhov, Molotov and Lazar Kaganovich, did not even examine the transcripts. He simply said, &quot;Agreed&quot;.

Within the hour, Tukhachevsky was summoned from his cell by NKVD Captain Vasily Blokhin. As Yezhov watched, the former Marshal was shot once in the back of the head.

Immediately afterward, Yezhov was summoned into Stalin&#x27;s presence. Stalin asked, &quot;What were Tukhachevsky&#x27;s last words?&quot; Yezhov responded, &quot;The snake said he was dedicated to the Motherland and Comrade Stalin. He asked for clemency. But it was obvious that he was not being straight, he hadn&#x27;t laid down his arms&quot;.

==Aftermath==

Tukhachevsky&#x27;s family members all suffered after his execution. His wife, Nina Tukhachevskaya, and his brothers Alexandr and Nikolai, both of whom were instructors in a Soviet military academy, were shot. Three of his sisters were sent to the Gulag. His underage daughter was arrested when she reached adulthood and remained in the Gulag until the 1950s Khrushchev Thaw. She lived in Moscow after her release and died in 1982.

Leon Trotsky described Tukhachevsky posthumously as an &quot;outstanding talent&quot; for his strategic skills and viewed the purge of the Red Army by the Stalinist bureaucracy as a means of preserving its political position.

Before Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s Secret Speech in 1956, Tukhachevsky was officially considered a fascist and fifth columnist. Soviet diplomats and supporters in the West enthusiastically promulgated this opinion. Then, on January 31, 1957, Tukhachevsky and his codefendants were declared innocent of all charges and were rehabilitated.

Although Tukhachevsky&#x27;s prosecution is almost universally regarded as a sham, Stalin&#x27;s motivations continue to be debated. In his 1968 book &quot;The Great Terror&quot;, the British historian Robert Conquest accuses Nazi Party leaders Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich of forging documents that implicated Tukhachevsky in an anti-Stalinist conspiracy with the Wehrmacht General Staff, to weaken the Soviets&#x27; defence capacity. The documents, Conquest said, were leaked to President Edvard Beneš of Czechoslovakia, who passed them to the Soviet Union through diplomatic channels. Conquest&#x27;s thesis of an SS conspiracy to frame Tukhachevsky was based upon the memoirs of Walter Schellenberg and Beneš.

In 1989, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union announced that new evidence had been found in Stalin&#x27;s archives indicating German intelligence&#x27;s intentions to fabricate disinformation about Tukhachevsky with the goal of eliminating him. &quot;Knowledge of personal characteristics of Stalin – like paranoia and extreme suspicion, had been possibly highest factor in it.&quot;

According to the opinion of Igor Lukes, who conducted a study on the matter, it was Stalin, Kaganovich and Yezhov who actually concocted Tukhachevsky&#x27;s &quot;treason&quot; themselves. At Yezhov&#x27;s order, the NKVD had instructed a known double agent, Nikolai Skoblin, to leak to Heydrich&#x27;s Sicherheitsdienst (SD) concocted information suggesting a plot by Tukhachevsky and the other Soviet generals against Stalin.

Seeing an opportunity to strike a blow at the Soviet military, Heydrich immediately acted on the information and undertook to improve on it. Heydrich&#x27;s forgeries were later leaked to the Soviets via Beneš and other neutral nations. While the SD believed that it had successfully fooled Stalin into executing his best generals, in reality, it had merely served as an unwitting pawn of the Soviet NKVD. Ironically, Heydrich&#x27;s forgeries were never used at trial. Instead, Soviet prosecutors relied on signed &quot;confessions&quot; beaten out of the defendants.

In 1956, the NKVD defector Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov published an article in &quot;Life Magazine&quot; with &quot;The Sensational Secret Behind the Damnation of Stalin&quot; as title. The story held that NKVD agents had discovered papers in the tsarist Okhrana archives proving Stalin had once been an informer. From this knowledge, the NKVD agents had planned a coup d&#x27;état with Tukhachevsky and other senior officers in the Red Army. According to Orlov, Stalin uncovered the conspiracy and used Yezhov to execute those responsible. The article lists the Eremin letter as documentary evidence that Stalin was part of the Okhrana, but most historians agree it&#x27;s a forgery.

Simon Sebag Montefiore, who has conducted extensive research in Soviet archives, states:

It has been speculated that the reason that Stalin had Tukhachevsky and other high-ranking generals executed was to remove a potential threat to his political power. Ultimately, Stalin and Yezhov would orchestrate the arrest and execution of thousands of Soviet military officers as well as five of the eight generals who presided over Tukhachevsky&#x27;s show trial.

While at the time of his death the Red Army was still firmly in the grip of the cavalry, Tukhachevsky had changed the Red Army&#x27;s mentality quite significantly. While many machine-gunners were being arrested and marshal Budyonny spoke in favour of cavalry, influential people, even including Marshal Voroshilov, under whom Tukhachevsky served and who took part in the arrests, began to question the cavalry&#x27;s position inside the Red Army. The horse remained ingrained in the Red Army, however. In peacetime, cavalry made sense to the Red Army; it was effective in smaller actions and internal security actions, many horse riders were available without requiring significant training, and there were the memories of the effectiveness of cavalry during the Civil War, all of which helped the horse in maintaining its central position inside the Red Army. When the Second World War began mixed units were set up, which included both cavalry and tanks; these played a central role in use of the deep operations doctrine during WWII.

<text>The Kawasaki KLR650 is a dual-sport motorcycle intended for both on-road and off-road riding. It was a long-standing model in Kawasaki&#x27;s lineup, having been introduced in 1987 to replace the 1984–1986 Kawasaki KLR600, and remaining almost unchanged through the 2007 model. The 2008 model was the first significant redesign of the KLR650 since its inception. It was built with a 652 cc four-stroke, DOHC, dual-counterbalanced, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine. The second significant redesign in 2022 added new features such as electronic fuel injection and an anti-lock braking system.

The KLR is widely used as an inexpensive adventure/touring bike. The addition of luggage and personalized modifications (GPS, heated handgrips, larger windscreens) make it more functional on long trips. The bikes have been used for long distance and intercontinental trips, as well as full global circumnavigation rides e.g., by Dr. Gregory Frazier in 2001 and 2002.


== First Generation (1987–2007) ==

Variants

* KLR650-A: The &quot;A&quot; model was introduced in 1987, based on its KLR600 predecessor (1984 to 1986). The &quot;A&quot; model remained nearly unchanged until the introduction of the 2008 model in USA, Canada, Australia and South Africa. It is not sold in Europe due to emission regulations.
* KLR650-B or Tengai: The Tengai got Adventure/Dakar styling, a full fairing blending into the tank, different sidepanels, and an unsprung front mudguard. It was sold in the US starting 1990 and in other countries for two years afterward – this could be classified as a separate model in its own right as the others are more trail bike orientated. Its name &quot;Tengai&quot; is a traditional Japanese saying which means &quot;The End of The Sky.&quot;
* KLR650-C: The &quot;C&quot; model gets completely new bodywork and is a more dirt-oriented motorcycle fitted with stiffer front forks, improved brakes, tubular engine guard, smaller fuel tank, and steel wheel rims. Lacking a temperature gauge, it has an over-heat lamp.
*The U.S. Military has KLR650s modified by Hayes Diversified Technologies to burn military-spec fuels including diesel. (M1030M1) All-new engines were designed to replace the 4-stroke gasoline engines. The new engines employ the original unit-construction main cases and transmission, but with new piston, cylinder, and other components. The balancing system that is used in the gasoline KLR650 engines (to reduce engine vibration) was removed from the military diesel KLR engines. Some components of the military diesel version can be applied to &quot;civilian&quot; KLR650 models, such as the nonspillable absorbed glass mat battery which offers several advantages over the conventional unsealed KLR batteries.

Incremental changes

Aside from livery/colors, the 1st Generation KLR650 did not change much between its 1987 introduction and the 2008 redesign. The key differences are:
* 1987: Crankshaft is unique to this year.
* 1988: Beefed up the engine cases with extra bolts between the crank and countershaft; crank has a different part number, and may be lighter.
* 1990: Countershaft improved with longer splines for increased engagement with sprocket.
* 1992: Changes to front brake master cylinder.
* Mid-1996: Changed valve cover, added bracket to hold cam chain bumper; changed crank to heavier unit; improved clutch basket with 1 more clutch plate; changed countershaft sprocket retainer from slotted plate to large nut; changed second and third gear ratios. Kickstarter no longer fits with new clutch basket. At least some early 1996 models had the matte black engine cases and covers rather than the later hammer-finished dark gray coloration found in the 1997 and later models.
* 2001: Around this time final assembly moved from Japan to Thailand. All major parts still made in Japan.
* 2007: New shift lever


==Second Generation (2008–2018)==
In 2008 the KLR650 was extensively redesigned compared to the minor year over year updates seen throughout the first generation. A vast majority of the changes are comfort and quality of life improvements, rather than performance-related changes.

Changes from first generation

* New trim, fairings, and turn signals
* New instrument panel and gauge cluster
* Redesigned handlebar control switches
* Twin-piston rear brake caliper (previously single piston)
* Alternator upgraded to 17 A output, providing 36  additional watts
* Reinforced idler-shaft lever (called the doohickey by KLR riders).
* Fork diameter increased from 
* New rear swingarm
* Larger petal-style vented brake rotors (280mm/240mm)
* Increased radiator capacity

Other minor changes were also done, such as a dual beam headlight, larger luggage rack, firmer seat and larger-diameter wheel spokes. With the numerous changes and improvements, the second generation KLR gained of dry weight to the bike.
Incremental changes

During production of the second generation of KLR, the following changes were made:
* 2009: New piston rings are thinner and have more tension, resulting in a significant reduction in oil consumption.
* Mid-2011: New clutch basket with only 6 clutch plates (vs 7 since 1996). The change starts at engine number KL650AEA72320.
* 2014 1/2: (Mid year) The 41mm forks were upgraded to make the springs 40% firmer and to increase the firmness of the rebound damping by 27%. The Uni-Trak rear linkage suspension were upgraded to provide a 63% increase spring rate and to increase the firmness of the rebound damping by 83%. Changes to the seat were made to make it narrower with a more tapered front. The width of the rear of the seat has been increased and has become less tapered.
==Third Generation (2022–present)==

After 3 years of being out of production, the third generation of the KLR 650 was redesigned and unveiled on January 26, 2021. The KLR650 was released at a price of in Thailand.

Changes from second generation
* Carburetor replaced for electronic fuel injector system
* ABS added (optional)
* New bodywork, trim, and fairings
* Adjustable windshield
* LCD gauge cluster
* Larger front disk brake
* Alternator upgraded to 26 A output

Other minor changes include new exhaust pipe diameter, revised cam profiles, and a new catalyzer. The third generation KLR gained of dry weight to the bike.

Variants

KLR650-S: Introduced in 2023, this variation offers shorter foot pegs, higher hand grips, and a slightly slimmer seat.
