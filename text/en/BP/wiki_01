<text>American handball, known as handball in the United States and sometimes referred to as wallball, is a sport in which players use their hands to hit a small, rubber ball against a wall such that their opponent(s) cannot do the same without the ball touching the ground twice or hitting out-of-bounds. The three versions are four-wall, three-wall and one-wall (also known as &quot;Wallball&quot; or &quot;international fronton&quot;). Each version can be played either by two players (singles), three players (cutthroat) or four players (doubles), but in official tournaments, singles and doubles are the only versions played.

==History==

Games in which a ball is hit or thrown have been referenced as far back as Homer and ancient Egypt. A game similar to handball was played by Northern and Central Americans from 1500 BC, most famously by the Aztecs as the Mesoamerican ballgame. However, no references to a rebound game using a wall survive. It is thought that these ancient games more closely resembled a form of hand tennis. Further examples of similar games include the European-originated games of &quot;Basque pelota&quot; (or &quot;Jai-alai&quot;), Gaelic handball, &quot;Valencian frontó&quot;, &quot;International fronton&quot; and Eton fives. 

References to similar games (then referred to as either &quot;hand-tennis&quot; and &quot;hand-ball&quot;) have been found as early as 1287, when the Synod of Exeter banned the game due to the damage it caused to church buildings. Other notable examples of wall ball games being banned include Robert Braybrooke, Bishop of London, who in 1385 prohibited the game. Another recorded game of striking a ball against a wall using a hand was in Scotland in 1427, when King James I ordered a cellar window in his palace courtyard to be blocked up, as it was interfering with his game. In Ireland, the earliest written record of a similar game is in the 1527 town statutes of Galway, which forbade the playing of ball games against the walls of the town. The first depiction of an Irish form of handball does not appear until 1785. The sport of handball in Ireland was eventually standardized as Gaelic handball. By the mid-19th century, Australians were playing a similar game, which developed into the modern sport of Australian handball.

===American===
In &quot;Treacherous Beauty&quot;, by Mark Jacob and Stephen H. Case, about the Arnold-Andre conspiracy, Major John Andre and General Sir Henry Clinton are said to have played a game called handball during the American Revolution. The earliest record of the modern game in the United States mentions two handball courts in San Francisco in 1873. The sport grew over the next few decades. By the early 1900s, four-wall handball was well established and a one-wall game was developed in New York City by beach-goers who hit bald tennis balls with their hands against the sides of the wooden jetties that lined beaches. This led to a rise in one-wall handball at New York beaches and by the 1930s, thousands of indoor and outdoor one-wall courts had been built throughout the city. American handball is seen predominantly in parks, beaches, and high school yards in New York, Chicago and other large urban areas.

=== National Championships ===
National championships in handball have been held annually in the United States since 1919. These championships were organized by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) until 1950, when their control was transferred to the newly formed United States Handball Association (USHA).

===Influence on racquetball and wall paddleball===
The sports of racquetball, squash, fives, four-wall and one-wall paddleball were heavily influenced by handball. Four-wall paddleball and one-wall paddleball were created when people took up wooden paddles to play on handball courts. Four-wall paddleball was invented in 1930 by Earl Riskey, a physical-education instructor at the University of Michigan, when he came up with the idea of using paddles to play on the school&#x27;s handball courts. Racquetball was invented in 1949 by Joe Sobek in Greenwich, Connecticut, when he played handball using a strung racquet.

== Court ==

American handball is played on a walled court, with either a single (front) wall, three walls, or in a fully enclosed four-wall court; four-wall courts typically have a ceiling while three-wall courts may or may not. The four-wall court is a rectangular box. The front wall is square, and the side walls are long and high.

In the middle of the floor lies a short line, dividing the floor into two squares. Also along the floor is the service line, which is in front of the short line. The service zone is the area between these two lines. The back wall of the court is usually high, with an above gallery for the referee, scorekeeper and spectators. Some courts have a glass back wall and glass side walls to allow for better viewing. (In three-wall court handball, the court often has a front wall and two full side walls, or the front wall is flanked by two triangular wings.)

== Play ==
Handball may be played as singles (two players against each other), doubles (two teams of two players), or &quot;cutthroat&quot; (three players rotating one against two). In cutthroat handball, one server plays against two receivers, until he or she is &quot;put out&quot; (Other terms include &quot;down&quot; or &quot;side out&quot;). Then, the left-most receiver serves. Serves rotate in this way until one player wins by scoring either 7, 11, 15, or 21 points. Should both teams reach a score 1 below the winning score, the game can be continued by &quot;win-by-two&quot; or &quot;straight&quot;. In &quot;win-by-two&quot;, the winning score is increased by 2 points. In &#x27;straight&#x27;, the score remains the same and cannot be pushed. When a tie of 20 is reached in a 21-point match, a common decision is &#x27;straight 25&#x27;, where the winning score is set to 25 and cannot be changed. The cutthroat mode of play is also known as &quot;triangles.&quot;

=== Service (4-Wall) ===
The ball is served by one player standing in the service zone. The server begins by dropping the ball to the floor of the service zone and striking it, after one bounce, with the hand or fist so that it hits the front wall. The ball must hit the front wall first; it may then hit at most one side wall before the first bounce; the served ball must then bounce on the floor past the short line but before reaching the back wall.

If the served ball lands in front of the short line, it is called a &quot;short&quot;, while a serve that reaches the back wall without bouncing is called &quot;long&quot;, and a serve that hits both side walls before hitting the floor is called a &quot;3-wall.&quot; These are all types of errors known as service faults. After one service fault, the server will have only one serve remaining. The server is &quot;put out&quot; by hitting two faults in a row and becomes the receiver. However, if any serve hits the ceiling, floor, or a side wall &quot;before&quot; hitting the front wall, the server is out (no second serve allowed).

In doubles, the server&#x27;s teammate has to stand in the service area with their back to a side wall in a service box, marked by a parallel line from the side wall, until the ball passes the short line.

=== Return (4-Wall) ===
While the server has the ball, the receiver must stand at least behind the short line, indicated by dashed lines extending from each side wall. Once the ball is served, the receiver must hit the ball either directly (&quot;on the fly&quot;) or after the first bounce. However, a receiver choosing to take the serve on the fly must first wait for the ball to cross the short line (the dashed line, in racquetball).

The ball can bounce off the floor twice. Also, any player during a return may hit the ball off the floor before it touches the front wall. The server then hits the ball on the rebound from the front wall, and play continues with the opponents alternately hitting the ball until one of them fails to make a legal return. After the serve and return, the ball may be played from anywhere and may hit any number of walls, the ceiling, or a player so long as it hits the front wall before bouncing on the floor. Players can &quot;hinder&quot; (block) their opponents from hitting the ball. Servers failing to make a legal return is &quot;put out&quot; and becomes the receiver. If the receiver fails to make the return, a point goes to the server, who continues to serve until &quot;put out.&quot; Only the server/serving team can score points. The game goes to the player/team first to score 21 points. A match goes to the player/team to win two out of three games; the third game goes to 11 points.

==Variants==

===Three-wall===
A three-wall handball court is an outside court with a front-wall, two side-walls (these may be &quot;full&quot; or &quot;half&quot;—half being a pair of sloping side-walls), and no back-wall in the play area. It is played very much like an indoor four-wall court, only with the challenge of returning the ball without any back-wall rebound. The long line at the forty-foot mark is considered out if the ball hits it when hitting the floor.

===One-wall / Wallball / International fronton===

One-wall handball courts have a wall wide and high. The court floor is wide and long. When not played as part of tournament or league play, the one-wall game typically uses the bigger ball called &quot;the big blue&quot; (described below in the &quot;Equipment&quot; section). The main difference between one-wall handball and other versions is that the ball must always be played off the front wall. One-wall handball can be watched by more people than a four-wall game. The court is also cheaper to build, making this version of handball popular at gymnasiums and playgrounds. In New York City alone, an estimated 2,299 public handball courts occupy the five boroughs.

==Equipment==

A typical outfit includes protective gloves, sneakers, athletic shorts and goggles. Eye protection is required in tournament handball, as the ball moves at high speeds and in close proximity to the players. It is rarely used in &quot;street&quot; handball, however, where a softer &quot;big blue&quot; ball is usually used.

The black or blue rubber ball weighs and is in diameter (smaller, heavier, and more dense than a racquetball), is hit with a gloved hand (open palm, fingers, fist, back of hand) (informal games often do not include gloves).

===Small ball versus big ball===

A true handball is referred to as an &quot;ace ball&quot; or, in earlier days, &quot;blackball&quot;. A racquetball used to play handball is called a &quot;big ball&quot; or &quot;big blue&quot;. A small ball is hard, bounces higher and moves faster. Types of small balls include the Red Ace (for men) and the White Ace (for women). The Red Ace small ball is heavier than the White Ace small ball.

A big ball bounces slower and is softer and hollower than a small ball.

Four-wall games use the small ball almost exclusively. Three-wall and one-wall games use both balls. Both balls are used extensively in New York City, with formal tournaments for big ball – NYC Big Blue, for example. Internationally, the big ball is used most often in the One-wall game (in the European 1-Wall Tour, the big ball is used exclusively for the Tour), however at World Handball Championships organised by the World Handball Council, competitions in both big-ball and small ball are offered for the One-wall code.

<doc id="465922" wikidata="Q1106818" url="?curid=465922" title="UniMás">
<text>UniMás (, stylized as UNIMÁS, and originally known as TeleFutura from its launch on January 14, 2002, to January 6, 2013) is an American Spanish-language free-to-air television network owned by TelevisaUnivision. The network&#x27;s programming, which is aimed at Hispanic Americans in the 18–34 age range, includes telenovelas and other serialized drama series, sports, sitcoms, reruns of imported series previously aired on parent network Univision, reality and variety series, and theatrically released feature films (primarily consisting of Spanish-dubbed versions of American movie releases).

The network is operated out of Univision&#x27;s South Florida headquarters in the Miami suburb of Doral, Florida. Since its launch, the network has made major inroads in overall and demographic viewership, eventually ranking as the second highest-rated Spanish-language television network in key dayparts, behind only sister network Univision, by 2012.

UniMás is available on cable and satellite television throughout most of the United States, with local stations in over 40 markets with large Hispanic and Latino populations. Most of these stations are pass-throughs for the network&#x27;s main programming feed, offering limited to no exclusive local programming. Univision Communications chief operating officer Randy Falco has overseen the network&#x27;s operations since his appointment in the position by the company on June 29, 2011.

==History==
===Origins===
The network traces its origins to Barry Diller&#x27;s November 1995 acquisition of the Home Shopping Network and its broadcasting arm Silver King Communications, which owned television stations affiliated with HSN in several larger media markets. In June 1998, the renamed USA Broadcasting (which had been merged into the Diller-owned USA Networks in 1997) launched a customized independent station format, &quot;CityVision&quot;, which infused syndicated programming – including a few produced by sister production unit Studios USA that also aired nationally on USA Network – with a limited amount of local entertainment and magazine programs (reminiscent of the format used by CITY-TV in Toronto and more prominently, its co-owned stations that became charter outlets of Citytv, when CHUM Limited expanded the format to other Canadian markets as a television system in 2002). USA&#x27;s Miami outlet, WYHS-TV, served as the test station for the format, disaffiliating from HSN and converting into a general entertainment outlet under the new call letters WAMI-TV.

By September 2000, USA Broadcasting had expanded the &quot;CityVision&quot; entertainment format to three of its thirteen other HSN outlets – with some of the stations adopting call letters referencing common nicknames for their home cities – WHOT-TV (now WUVG-DT) in Atlanta, KSTR-TV in Dallas–Fort Worth and WHUB-TV (now WUTF-DT) in Boston. Before the group could carry out the proposed conversions of its other stations into independent stations, USA Networks announced that it would sell off its television station group in the summer of 2000, to focus on its cable network and television production properties. Among the prospective buyers for the thirteen-station group were The Walt Disney Company (which would have created duopolies with ABC owned-and-operated stations in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston) and Univision Communications (which would create duopolies with Univision owned-and-operated stations in those same four cities); the latter purchased the USA Broadcasting stations for $1.1 billion on December 7, 2000, with the sale being finalized on May 21, 2001.

===TeleFutura===

On May 15, 2001, during Univision&#x27;s upfront presentation, Univision Communications announced its intentions to form a then-unnamed secondary television network that would compete with Univision, Telemundo and the then-recently launched Azteca América. Organizational plans for the network called for the recently acquired former USA Broadcasting stations to serve as the network&#x27;s nuclei, with its programming catering to bilingual Latinos with a preference toward watching English-language television programs, as well as young adult males between the ages 18 and 34 that seldom watch Spanish language television other than sporting events; Univision executives expected the network to reach 80% of all Hispanic and Latino households throughout the U.S. that own at least one television set by the time of its launch. Although Univision maintained a dominant market share among the American Spanish language television networks (holding an 83% share of Latino viewers during prime time at the time), Univision Communications executives did not believe that a second network would result in a cannibalization of the flagship network&#x27;s market share.

On July 31, 2001, Univision announced that TeleFutura would be the name for the new network, with Univision Communications chairman and chief executive officer A. Jerrold Perenchio noting the name was suggested in part by two of corporate employees to &quot;represent[…] the future of Spanish-language television&quot;. Univision continued to run the nine HSN affiliates and four independent stations (one of which regained its affiliation with HSN earlier that year) as English language outlets for several months following the USA Broadcasting purchase.

TeleFutura formally launched at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 14, 2002, debuting initially on 18 Univision-owned stations (consisting of twelve former USA Broadcasting stations – an additional station, WQHS-TV in Cleveland, was converted into an owned-and-operated station of parent network Univision instead; it would later carry UniMás on a subchannel) – and six others that Univision Communications acquired afterward) and 24 affiliates owned by other companies. Initial programming on the network – which was counterprogrammed to offer distinct programs that do not directly compete with shows aired on Univision – included &quot;Escándalo TV&quot; (&quot;Scandal TV&quot;; the program was originally titled &quot;Escándalo en el Medio Dia&quot;, before being changed due to the existence of a similarly titled Mexican program produced by Televisa), a three-hour gossip/entertainment program designed to compete with similar newsmagazines such as Telemundo&#x27;s &quot;Cotorreando&quot; (and ran on the network until October 2011); and the daytime talk show &quot;Monica&quot;.

The remainder of TeleFutura&#x27;s programming consisted of imported telenovelas from Latin American production companies with which Univision maintained programming agreements including Televisa, Venevisión, Coral Productions, RCTV, RCN and Rede Globo, which aired only on weekday afternoons at its launch. Evenings and weekends primarily consisted of feature films, consisting exclusively of dubbed Spanish prints of American releases from the 1980s onward, as part of the umbrella showcases &quot;CinePlex&quot; (for daytime movies, usually those airing on weekends), &quot;CinEscape&quot; (for late night movies), &quot;Cine Especial&quot; (for special movie presentations) or &quot;Cine de las Estrellas&quot; (for prime time movies). The network also featured news and sports updates during prime time, as well as several sports programs and events including &quot;Contacto Deportivo&quot; (&quot;Contact Sports&quot;), an hour-long weeknight sports news program; weekly boxing matches on Friday nights; and soccer matches from Liga MX on weekend afternoons.

On June 27, 2006, Univision Communications was acquired by Broadcasting Media Partners Inc. – a consortium of investment firms led by the Haim Saban-owned Saban Capital Group (which had previously owned Saban Entertainment until its sale to The Walt Disney Company in June 2001, as part of News Corporation&#x27;s sale of Fox Family Worldwide), TPG Capital, L.P., Providence Equity Partners, Madison Dearborn Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners – for $12.3 billion (increasing to $13.7 billion or $36.25 per share by the sale&#x27;s closure), plus the assumption of $1.4 billion in debt. The sale received federal approval and was formally consummated on March 27, 2007.

During the February 2007 sweeps period, according to Nielsen Media Research, TeleFutura made significant gains in viewership at the expense of Telemundo, which it overtook for second place among the major Spanish-language networks in the key demographics of Adults 18–34, Men 18–34 and Men 18–49. On February 26, 2010, TeleFutura once again ranked as the second highest-rated Spanish-language network in the United States and earned its highest ratings for an entertainment special in the network&#x27;s history, with the finale of the reality competition series &quot;Buscando La Doble de Selena&quot; (&quot;Search for Selena&#x27;s Double&quot;), which attracted 1.9 million total viewers. TeleFutura finished 2012 as the youngest broadcast network with a median age of 36 and finished the year averaging 642,000 total viewers aged 2 and up. It also ranked as the second highest-rated Spanish-language network in 2012 in key dayparts among Adults 18–49 and Adults 18–34.

===UniMás===

On December 3, 2012, Univision Communications announced that it would relaunch TeleFutura as UniMás – which loosely translates to &quot;Univision Plus&quot;, to underline its ties to its parent network Univision – with a programming refocusing to appeal more towards Latino males between the ages of 12 and 35 years old. The revamped network would feature Mexican and Colombian-imported programming from Televisa, Caracol Televisión and RTI Colombia (the latter two of which compete with RCN in the domestic Colombian market), which had maintained longstanding programming and production agreements with rival Telemundo, through contracts struck months before the relaunch, it would also increase its reliance on sports content for its weekend schedule.

The new logo and brand identity, which debuted on-air at 5:00 a.m. CST on January 7, 2013 (exactly one week before the network&#x27;s 11th anniversary), were created in collaboration with branding firm Troika Design Group. As part of the campaign to announce the launch, Univision Communications launched an extensive advertising campaign for UniMás that included promotional spots, digital ads, print ads and outdoor advertising in New York City, Los Angeles and Miami. The network&#x27;s prime time was revamped to feature several new serial dramas formatted of a grittier nature than the romance-themed telenovelas produced by Televisa that air on Univision to appeal to male viewers including the Colombian adaptation of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, &quot;Metástasis&quot;; the crime dramas &quot;Made in Cartagena&quot; and &quot;¿Quién Eres Tú?&quot; (&quot;Infringement&quot;); and the boxing-themed drama &quot;Cloroformo&quot; (&quot;Chloroform&quot;), which were included among the relaunched network&#x27;s initial prime time offerings.

On May 13, 2019, UniMás refocused its programming strategy in order to target a younger audience to that of its parent network Univision, with a focus on news, sports, unscripted entertainment and reality shows, most of them broadcast live. On that day, the network added an early edition of Noticiero Univision: Edición Nocturna at 10 p.m., coinciding with the arrival of Colombian newsreader Patricia Janiot to the broadcast, co-anchoring alongside Enrique Acevedo. On October 31, 2021, this shift was completed with the launch of a new wordmark logo and brand identity, designed, as in 2013, by Troika Design Group, and a new slogan, &quot;Vívelo Todo&quot; (&quot;Live it All&quot;).

==Programming==

UniMás operates on a 126-hour network programming schedule, which it has maintained since its launch as TeleFutura in January 2002. It provides general entertainment programming to owned-and-operated and affiliated stations daily from 6:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. Two separate children&#x27;s programming blocks known as &quot;Toonturama&quot; and &quot;Toonturama Junior&quot; – which features some programs compliant with FCC educational programming requirements – airs for five hours each Saturday at 7:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. All other time periods are filled with infomercials.

As TeleFutura, the network featured a broad mix of programming, consisting of telenovelas, sports, feature films, entertainment newsmagazines, comedy series (such as &quot;¡Qué Locura!&quot; (&quot;What Madness!&quot;) and &quot;Chespirito&quot;), game shows (such as the &quot;Family Feud&quot; adaptations &quot;¿Qué dice la gente?&quot; (&quot;What do the People Say?&quot;) and &quot;100 Mexicanos Dijeron&quot; (&quot;A Hundred Mexicans Said&quot;))) and variety series (such as &quot;Pepsi Música&quot; (&quot;Pepsi Music&quot;) and &quot;Sabadazo&quot;). In January 2009, TeleFutura launched the daily gossip show &quot;La Tijera&quot;, hosted by Charitin Goyco, Liliana Rodriguez, Paul Bouche, Carolina Sandoval and Augusto Valverde. The hosting staff was gradually altered over its two-year run to include Tanya Charry, Raul Garcia, Anabelle Blum and Rodolfo Jimenez joining Sandoval; the show was cancelled in October 2011. On October 10, 2011, &quot;La Tujera&quot; was replaced by a daily gossip show &quot;Tómbola&quot;, while the network also debuted a late night talk show &quot;Noche de Perros&quot;; due to low ratings, &quot;Tombola&quot; was cancelled on January 17, 2012, followed by &quot;Noche de Perros&quot; three months later on April 20.

Currently, the majority of UniMás&#x27; programming consists of telenovelas and series produced by Televisa (the majority of which originated on the company&#x27;s flagship network in Mexico, Canal de las Estrellas), Caracol Televisión and RTI Colombia; several of the network&#x27;s Televisa-sourced programs (including &quot;Casos de Família&quot; (&quot;Family Cases&quot;) and &quot;El Chavo del 8&quot;) have also previously aired on parent network Univision, many having aired on that network years prior to being broadcast on UniMás. It also carries a moderate amount of first-run original programming produced by sister production unit Univision Studios, including the reality courtroom show &quot;Veredicto Final&quot; and sports magazine program &quot;Zona NBA&quot;.

Notably, UniMás was to replace Telemundo as the U.S. Spanish language broadcaster of the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants through an agreement with the Miss Universe Organization that was signed on February 5, 2015. However, Univision Communications chose to relinquish the rights to the two pageants on June 25 of that year, as part of its decision to cut business ties with then-Miss Universe Organization co-owner Donald Trump in response to controversial remarks he made during his June 16 speech announcing his candidacy for the Republican Party Presidential nomination in which Trump stated that Mexicans immigrating into the U.S. were responsible for the transporting of illegal drugs, brought crime, rapists and drug dealers into the country, and called for the building of a wall along the Mexico–United States border. The termination of the agreement led Trump and the Miss Universe Organization to jointly file a breach of contract and defamation lawsuit against Univision Communications in the New York Supreme Court on June 30, 2015, seeking $500 million in damages.

===News programming===
The only general news program to have aired on the network to date debuted on October 17, 2005, when TeleFutura began airing &quot;En Vivo y Directo&quot; (&quot;Live and Direct&quot;), a half-hour early evening newscast that aired at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time (opposite a taped 4:00 p.m. news program on sister network Galavisión) that featured an in-depth analysis of news stories affecting the U.S. Hispanic community. The program was cancelled in April 2006 due to low ratings, replacing the newscast with movies.

As UniMás, on September 20, 2015, the network began airing &quot;Fusion Presenta&quot; (&quot;Fusion Presents&quot;), a weekly block on Sunday nights consisting of Spanish-language versions of original docu-series originally aired on English language sister cable network Fusion. In November 2015, the network also began simulcasting Univision&#x27;s late night newscast, &quot;Noticiero Univision Edición Nocturna&quot; on weeknights, as Univision began several simulcasting efforts to maximize its ratings, including having lead-out program &quot;Contacto Deportivo&quot; airing both on Univision and Univision Deportes Network to compete against the flagship English broadcast and the ESPN Deportes Spanish version of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

===Sports programming===

Through its association with Univision&#x27;s sports division, Univision Deportes (which is also responsible for the production of sports content on Galavisión and its dedicated cable-satellite sports channel Univision Deportes Network), UniMás broadcasts soccer matches from Liga MX (which have aired since the network&#x27;s inception in January 2002) and Major League Soccer. The network has also broadcast weekly boxing matches on most Fridays for much of its history; as TeleFutura, the network debuted a new weekly boxing showcase, &quot;Sólo boxeo&quot;, on April 30, 2010.

The network also served as a supplementary Spanish-language broadcaster of the FIFA Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s World Cups through Univision Communications&#x27; exclusive contract with FIFA for the U.S. Spanish-language television rights to the tournament that concluded in 2014 (Telemundo and NBC Universo assumed the contract beginning with the 2015 Women&#x27;s World Cup). Just a few months after its launch TeleFutura first aired the replays of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. As TeleFutura, it carried eight live games during the 2006 FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup, all occurring during the last days of group play when multiple games are played simultaneously (in the same capacity that ESPN2 served for English-language rightsholder ESPN); the network also aired replays of tournament matches and World Cup recap shows. In 2007, TeleFutura acquired the exclusive rights to broadcast weekly Major League Soccer games on Sunday afternoons; its relationship with the league expanded in 2012, when the network aired the MLS Cup, which was watched by 485,000 viewers (a 58% increase from the 2011 final and a 109% increase over the 2010 final, both of which aired on Galavisión).

Upon the rebrand to UniMás, the network increased its sports offerings with events such as soccer matches from the Mexico National Team and Liga MX, and the acquisition of rights to the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and Copa América Centenario, along with the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup. TeleFutura shows carried over to the relaunched UniMás included sports programs such as &quot;Solo Boxeo&quot; and the nightly sports news program &quot;Contacto Deportivo&quot; (which would eventually move to Univision after a twelve-year run on TeleFutura/UniMás on March 8, 2015). On November 1, 2014, UniMás began airing rebroadcasts of the El Rey Network professional wrestling showcase &quot;Lucha Underground&quot; on Saturday afternoons. On May 3, 2015, the network debuted a weekly sports magazine program &quot;Zona NBA&quot; (&quot;NBA Zone&quot;), featuring news and interviews from around the National Basketball Association (NBA).

The network began airing UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League matches in 2018 as a result of Univision acquiring the Spanish-language rights to UEFA club competitions from Fox Sports beginning with the 2018–19 season.

TelevisaUnivision will also have the exclusive Spanish-language rights in the U.S. to the 2024 American League Division Series and American League Championship Series, which will air on UniMás and simulcast on TUDN, with select games on Univision. Additionally, Game 1 of the 2024 World Series will be broadcast on Univision.

===Children&#x27;s programming===

For much of its history, the bulk of TeleFutura/UniMás&#x27; children&#x27;s programming was derived of mainly live-action and animated programming from American and international producers, much of which consisted of dubbed versions of series natively produced in English (including &quot;Bob the Builder&quot;, &quot;Ned&#x27;s Newt&quot; and &quot;Dumb Bunnies&quot;).

When the network launched in 2002, TeleFutura launched three children&#x27;s program blocks aimed at different audiences: &quot;Mi Tele&quot; (&quot;My TV&quot;), a two-hour animation block on weekday mornings featuring a mix of imported Spanish-language cartoons (such as &quot;Fantaghiro&quot; and &quot;El Nuevo Mundo de los Gnomos&quot; (&quot;The New World of the Gnomes&quot;)); and two weekend morning blocks, &quot;Toonturama&quot;, a three-hour lineup that mainly featured dubbed versions of American and European animated series as well as anime series (such as &quot;Flight Squad&quot; and &quot;Problem Child&quot;, &quot;Lost Universe&quot;, &quot;Tenchi Universe&quot; and &quot;Red Baron&quot;; &quot;Toad Patrol&quot; was an exception to the dubbing as it needed to use an English dub to fix translation issues) and a two-hour companion block that preceded it on Saturday and Sunday mornings, &quot;Toonturama Junior&quot;, featuring programs aimed at preschoolers that fulfilled educational programming requirements defined by the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Television Act (among the programs featured on &quot;Toonturama Junior&quot; was &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; (&quot;City Square Sesame&quot;), Televisa and Sesame Workshop&#x27;s Spanish-language adaptation of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; featuring a mix of original segments featuring characters based on its U.S.-based parent series and dubbed interstitials from the aforementioned originating program, which had aired on Univision since 1995 and passed on the U.S. television rights to TeleFutura at its launch). On September 9, 2018, in an agreement with Animaccord, the network launched the popular Russian cartoon Masha and the Bear, airing it every Sunday morning.

==Stations==

, UniMás has 26 owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 19 additional television stations encompassing 19 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. Counting only conventional over-the-air affiliates, the network has a combined national reach of 46.54% of all households in the United States (or 145,419,291 Americans with at least one television set).

Despite Univision&#x27;s over-the-air expansion since its sister network launched as TeleFutura, UniMás has been slower in expanding its national coverage through broadcast television outlets and does not have over-the-air stations in several major markets with relatively sizeable populations of Hispanic and Latino residents where Univision and/or at least one of its competing Spanish language networks have broadcast affiliates, most notably Seattle, Washington; Kansas City, Missouri; Amarillo, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Midland, Texas. Partly in order to fill these gaps, UniMás provides a national cable network feed that is distributed directly to cable, satellite and IPTV providers as an alternative method of distribution in markets without either the availability or the demand for a locally based owned-and-operated or affiliate station.

The network maintains affiliations with low-power stations in a few markets, such as Philadelphia (WFPA-CD), Bakersfield, California (KBTF-CD), Las Vegas (KELV-LD) and Palm Springs, California (KEVC-CD). In some markets, including both of those mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station. UniMás also maintains a handful of subchannel-only affiliations in a few markets, the largest by market size being WUVG-DT2 in Atlanta, Georgia, whose parent station operates as a Univision owned-and-operated station.

Currently, the Entravision Communications Corporation is the largest operator of UniMás stations in terms of both numerical total and overall market reach, owning or providing services to 20 UniMás-affiliated stations, including that are relayed on subchannel of full-power sister stations and two that the company operates under local marketing agreements with network parent Univision Communications (including stations in markets such as Boston (WUTF-DT) and Orlando (WOTF-DT)).

==Related services==
===Video-on-demand services===
UniMás provides video on demand access for delayed viewing of full episodes of the network&#x27;s programming through various means, including via Hulu&#x27;s Hulu Latino platform through a content deal with the service. The network also a traditional VOD service – UniMás on Demand – which is carried on most traditional cable and IPTV providers, which originally launched on February 1, 2011, as TeleFutura On Demand, and also offers the network&#x27;s news programming, tape-delayed versions of its sports telecasts and feature film content alongside telenovelas.

Due to restrictions imposed on the streaming service by Univision Communications, Hulu limits day-after-air streaming of newer episodes of UniMás&#x27; programs to subscribers of its subscription service until eight days after their initial broadcast, in order to encourage live or same-week (via both DVR and cable on demand) viewing. Like the video-on-demand television services provided by the other U.S. broadcast networks, UniMás on Demand disables fast forwarding for content provided through the service.

====UVideos====
Since the service launched on October 29, 2012, Univision Communications&#x27; multi-platform streaming service UVideos has made full-length episodes of UniMás&#x27; programs (including those produced by Televisa and its other content providers) available on its website at UVideos.com and companion mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers supporting the iOS and Android platforms (with programs streamable over 3G and WiFi networks). The most recent episodes are usually made available for streaming on the service (as well as Univision on Demand) the day after their original broadcast to subscribers of participating pay television providers (such as Comcast, Verizon FiOS and Time Warner Cable) using an ISP account via an authenticated user login. The service also includes select original digital content, user-enabled English subtitling for most programs (except for excerpts from Noticiero Univision broadcasts) as well as a social stream featuring viewer comments from the UVideos and other social media platforms, which are time-synched to the user&#x27;s local time zone to mimic a live relay to the user as posted during the program&#x27;s original broadcast.

====Univision Now====
On November 18, 2015, Univision Communications launched Univision Now, an over-the-top subscription video on demand streaming service, which features program content from both UniMás and Univision without requiring an existing pay television subscription in order to access. The service – which is available for either $5.99 per month or $59.99 per year, although prospective users can access content through a seven-day free trial – is initially available via a dedicated website (univisionnow.com), and apps for iOS and Android devices.

The service carries UniMás&#x27; alternative series, classic series previously seen on the network and live soccer matches from Liga MX and Major League Soccer; a live stream of the network&#x27;s main feed is also available, and incorporates a DVR-style &quot;rewind&quot; feature allowing users to replay live content up to 72 hours after their broadcast. New episodes of prime time series aired on UniMás and Univision – both original content and programs from their distribution partners – are made available for streaming the day after their broadcast on the two linear television networks and are accessible for seven days following their airdate. Restrictions imposed by film studios that supply such content for the network prohibit certain movies carried on UniMás from being made available on Univision NOW.

===UniMás HD===
UniMás&#x27; master feed is transmitted in 1080i high definition, the native resolution format for Univision Communications&#x27; network television properties. However, twelve UniMás-affiliated stations – all but one of which is owned by Entravision Communications – currently transmit the network&#x27;s programming in 480i standard definition, either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry programming from another network in high definition on their main channel or because a primary feed UniMás affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD.

What was then TeleFutura launched its high definition simulcast feed at 12:02 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time on January 1, 2010, on its East and West Coast flagship stations in New York City and Los Angeles, WFUT/WFTY-DT and KFTR-DT (which, along with Univision, became the last two U.S. broadcast networks to begin offering their programming in HD). Most of the network&#x27;s programming is presented in HD (including most telenovelas; sports programs, including soccer events; newsmagazines; and most feature films, depending on the availability of high-definition &quot;television&quot; cuts of films) is broadcast by the network in high definition; exceptions exist with certain telenovelas, sitcoms and variety series as well as select children&#x27;s programs aired as part of the network&#x27;s weekend morning children&#x27;s block produced prior to 2008 that air in reruns, which continue to be presented in their native 4:3 standard definition format. DirecTV began carrying the Eastern Time Zone feed of the HD simulcast nationwide on April 28, 2010; Dish Network subsequently added it two weeks later on May 12, 2010. TeleFutura&#x27;s HD format was also rebranded as UniMás HD on January 7, 2013.

==Controversies==
===Carriage disputes===
On March 4, 2016, UniMás, along with its sister channels, Univision, Galavisión, TUDN and Univision tlnovelas were dropped by AT&amp;T U-verse due to a carriage dispute. This however, did not affect DirecTV customers, despite being a subsidiary of AT&amp;T, as they were done on a separate deal. All of Univision&#x27;s channels (including UniMás) were later returned to the U-verse lineup on March 24, 2016.

On January 27, 2017, Charter Spectrum (along with Time Warner Cable and Bright House, the latter merged with Charter Communications on 2016) faced another dispute with Univision, warning Charter Communications that UniMas and its sister channels could be removed from Charter by January 31, 2017. Prior to then, Univision sued Charter over pay carriage rates at the New York Supreme Court in July 2016. On, January 31, Charter customers lost access to all of Univision&#x27;s channels, including UniMás and Galavision. On February 2, the New York Superior Court ordered Univision to end the blackout on Charter as negotiations continue. This blackout affects all Univision affiliates, even if Univision doesn&#x27;t own them, so it included all stations owned by Entravision Communications, even if Entravision was not involved in the dispute.

<text>William Horwood (born 12 May 1944 in Oxford) is an English novelist. He grew up on the East Kent coast, primarily in Deal, within a family fractious with &quot;parental separation, secret illegitimacy, alcoholism and genteel poverty&quot;.

Between the ages of six and ten, he was raised in foster care, attended school in Germany for a year, then went on to Grammar School at age eleven. In his eighteenth year, he attended Bristol University to study geography, after which he had any number of jobs—fundraising and teaching, among others, as well as editing for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

In 1978, at age 34, he retired from the newspaper in order to pursue novel-writing as his primary career, inspired by some long-ago reading of Frances Hodgson Burnett&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;.

His first novel, &quot;Duncton Wood&quot;, an allegorical tale about a community of moles, was published in 1980. It was followed by two sequels, forming &quot;The Duncton Chronicles&quot;, and also a second trilogy, &quot;The Book of Silence&quot;. William Horwood has also written two stand-alone novels intertwining the lives of humans and of eagles (&quot;The Stonor Eagles&quot; and &quot;Callanish&quot;), and &quot;The Wolves of Time&quot; duology. &quot;Skallagrigg,&quot; his 1987 novel about disability, love, and trust, was made into a BBC film in 1994. In addition, he has written a number of sequels to the 1908 novel &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; by Kenneth Grahame.

&quot;Boy with No Shoes,&quot; published in August 2004, is a fictionalised memoir that explores challenging themes of childhood in Kent.

In 2007, he collaborated with historian Helen Rappaport to produce &quot;Dark Hearts of Chicago&quot;, a historical mystery and thriller set in nineteenth-century Chicago. It was re-published in 2008 as &quot;City of Dark Hearts&quot; with some significant revisions and cuts under the pen name James Conan.

After almost fifteen years, Horwood returned to his hallmark genre of fantasy, publishing the first novel in his &quot;Hyddenworld&quot; quartet in 2010. Each novel is thematically based on a season — the first is &quot;Hyddenworld: Spring&quot;, the next to be published was &quot;Hyddenworld: Awakening&quot; followed by &quot;Hyddenworld: Harvest&quot; and &quot;Hyddenworld: Winter&quot; and deals with the adventures of a cast of humans and &quot; (&#x27;little folk,&#x27; with some distinct fae overtones) on a quest to find gems holding the powers of the season for which each is named. &quot;If they can be brought together they may combine to re-kindle the fires of a dying universe.&quot;

<text>Franco-Provençal (also Francoprovençal, Patois or Arpitan) is a language within the Gallo-Romance family, originally spoken in east-central France, western Switzerland, and northwestern Italy.

Franco-Provençal has several distinct dialects and is separate from but closely related to neighbouring Romance dialects (the langues d&#x27;oïl and the langues d&#x27;oc, in France, as well as Rhaeto-Romance in Switzerland and Italy).

Even with all its distinct dialects counted together, the number of Franco-Provençal speakers has been declining significantly and steadily. According to UNESCO, Franco-Provençal was already in 1995 a &quot;potentially endangered language&quot; in Italy and an &quot;endangered language&quot; in Switzerland and France. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; classifies it as &quot;nearly extinct&quot;.

The designation &quot;Franco-Provençal&quot; (Franco-Provençal: ; ; ) dates to the 19th century. In the late 20th century, it was proposed that the language be referred to under the neologism Arpitan (Franco-Provençal: &#x27;; ), and its [[Areal feature|areal]] as &quot;[[Arpitania]]&quot;. The use of both neologisms remains very limited, with most academics using the traditional form (often written without the hyphen:Francoprovençal&quot;&#x27;), while language speakers refer to it almost exclusively as patois or under the names of its distinct dialects (&quot;Savoyard&quot;, &quot;Lyonnais&quot;, &quot;Gaga&quot; in Saint-Étienne, etc.).

Formerly spoken throughout the Duchy of Savoy, Franco-Provençal is nowadays (as of 2016) spoken mainly in the Aosta Valley as a native language by all age ranges. All remaining areas of the Franco-Provençal language region show practice limited to higher age ranges, except for Evolène and other rural areas of French-speaking Switzerland. It is also spoken in the Alpine valleys around Turin and in two isolated towns (Faeto and Celle di San Vito) in Apulia.

In France, it is one of the three Gallo-Romance language families of the country (alongside the langues d&#x27;oïl and the langues d&#x27;oc). Though it is a regional language of France, its use in the country is marginal. Still, organizations are attempting to preserve it through cultural events, education, scholarly research, and publishing.

== Classification ==
Although the name Franco-Provençal suggests it is a bridge dialect between French and the Provençal dialect of Occitan, it is a separate Gallo-Romance language that transitions into the Oïl languages Burgundian and Frainc-Comtou to the northwest, into Romansh to the east, into the Gallo-Italic Piemontese to the southeast, and finally into the Vivaro-Alpine dialect of Occitan to the southwest.

The philological classification for Franco-Provençal published by the Linguasphere Observatory (Dalby, 1999/2000, p. 402) follows:

A philological classification for Franco-Provençal published by Ruhlen (1987, pp. 325–326) is as follows:
== History ==
Franco-Provençal emerged as a Gallo-Romance variety of Latin. The linguistic region comprises east-central France, western portions of Switzerland, and the Aosta Valley of Italy with the adjacent alpine valleys of the Piedmont. This area covers territories once occupied by pre-Roman Celts, including the Allobroges, Sequani, Helvetii, Ceutrones, and Salassi. By the fifth century, the region was controlled by the Burgundians. Federico Krutwig has also suggested a Basque substrate in the toponyms of the easternmost Valdôtain dialect.

Franco-Provençal is first attested in manuscripts from the 12th century, possibly diverging from the langues d&#x27;oïl as early as the eighth–ninth centuries (Bec, 1971). However, Franco-Provençal is consistently typified by a strict, myopic comparison to French, and so is characterized as &quot;conservative&quot;. Thus, commentators such as Désormaux consider &quot;medieval&quot; the terms for many nouns and verbs, including &quot;pâta&quot; &quot;rag&quot;, &quot;bayâ&quot; &quot;to give&quot;, &quot;moussâ&quot; &quot;to lie down&quot;, all of which are conservative only relative to French. As an example, Désormaux, writing on this point in the foreword of his Savoyard dialect dictionary, states:
Franco-Provençal failed to garner the cultural prestige of its three more widely spoken neighbors: French, Occitan, and Italian. Communities where speakers lived were generally isolated from each other because of the mountains. In addition, the internal boundaries of the entire speech area were divided by wars and religious conflicts.

France, Switzerland, the Franche-Comté (part of the Spanish Monarchy), and the duchy, later kingdom, ruled by the House of Savoy politically divided the region. The strongest possibility for any dialect of Franco-Provençal to establish itself as a major language died when an edict, dated 6 January 1539, was confirmed in the parliament of the Duchy of Savoy on 4 March 1540 (the duchy was partially occupied by France since 1538). The edict explicitly replaced Latin (and by implication, any other language) with French as the language of law and the courts (Grillet, 1807, p. 65).

The name &quot;Franco-Provençal&quot; (&quot;franco-provenzale&quot;) is due to Graziadio Isaia Ascoli (1878), chosen because the dialect group was seen as intermediate between French and Provençal. Franco-Provençal dialects were widely spoken in their speech areas until the 20th century. As French political power expanded and the &quot;single-national-language&quot; doctrine was spread through French-only education, Franco-Provençal speakers abandoned their language, which had numerous spoken variations and no standard orthography, in favor of the culturally prestigious French.

== Origin of the name ==
Franco-Provençal is an extremely fragmented language, with scores of highly peculiar local variations that never merged over time. The range of dialect diversity is far greater than that found in the langue d&#x27;oïl and Occitan regions. Comprehension of one dialect by speakers of another is often difficult. Nowhere is it spoken in a &quot;pure form&quot; and there is not a &quot;standard reference language&quot; that the modern generic label used to identify the language may indicate. This explains why speakers use local terms to name it, such as Bressan, Forèzien, or Valdôtain, or simply &quot;patouès&quot; (&quot;patois&quot;). Only in recent years have speakers who are not specialists in linguistics become conscious of the language&#x27;s collective identity.
The language region was first recognized in the 19th century during advances in research into the nature and structure of human speech. Graziadio Isaia Ascoli (1829–1907), a pioneering linguist, analyzed the unique phonetic and structural characteristics of numerous spoken dialects. In an article written about 1873 and published later, he offered a solution to existing disagreements about dialect frontiers and proposed a new linguistic region. He placed it between the &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; group of languages (&quot;Franco&quot;) and the &quot;langues d&#x27;oc&quot; group (&quot;Provençal&quot;) and gave Franco-Provençal its name.

Ascoli (1878, p. 61) described the language in these terms in his defining essay on the subject:

Although the name Franco-Provençal appears misleading, it continues to be used in most scholarly journals for the sake of continuity. Suppression of the hyphen between the two parts of the language name in French (&quot;francoprovençal&quot;) was generally adopted following a conference at the University of Neuchâtel in 1969; however, most English-language journals continue to use the traditional spelling.

The name Romand has been in use regionally in Switzerland at least since 1424, when notaries in Fribourg were directed to write their minutes in both German and &quot;Rommant&quot;. It continues to appear in the names of many Swiss cultural organizations today. The term &quot;Romand&quot; is also used by some professional linguists who feel that the compound word &quot;Franco-Provençal&quot; is &quot;inappropriate&quot;.

A proposal in the 1960s to call the language Burgundian (French: &quot;burgondien&quot;) did not take hold, mainly because of the potential for confusion with an Oïl language known as Burgundian, which is spoken in a neighbouring area, known in English as Burgundy (). Other areas also had historical or political claims to such names, especially (Meune, 2007).

Some contemporary speakers and writers prefer the name Arpitan because it underscores the independence of the language and does not imply a union to any other established linguistic group. &quot;Arpitan&quot; is derived from an indigenous word meaning &quot;alpine&quot; (&quot;mountain highlands&quot;). It was popularized in the 1980s by Mouvement Harpitanya, a political organization in the Aosta Valley. In the 1990s, the term lost its particular political context. The &quot;Aliance Culturèla Arpitana&quot; (Arpitan Cultural Alliance) is advancing the cause for the name &quot;Arpitan&quot; through the Internet, publishing efforts, and other activities. The organization was founded in 2004 by Stéphanie Lathion and Alban Lavy in Lausanne, Switzerland, and is now based in Fribourg. In 2010 SIL adopted the name &quot;Arpitan&quot; as the primary name of the language in ISO 639-3, with &quot;Francoprovençal&quot; as an additional name form.

Native speakers call this language patouès (patois) or nosta moda (&quot;our way [of speaking]&quot;). Some Savoyard speakers call their language sarde. This is a colloquial term used because their ancestors were subjects of the Kingdom of Sardinia ruled by the House of Savoy until Savoie and Haute-Savoie were annexed by France in 1860. The language is called gaga in France&#x27;s Forez region and appears in the titles of dictionaries and other regional publications. &quot;Gaga&quot; (and the adjective ) comes from a local name for the residents of Saint-Étienne, popularized by Auguste Callet&#x27;s story &quot;La légende des Gagats&quot; published in 1866.

== Geographic distribution ==

The historical linguistic domain of the Franco-Provençal language are:

=== Italy ===
*Aosta Valley (place name in Valdôtain patois: &quot;Val d&#x27;Outa&quot;; in Italian: &quot;Valle d&#x27;Aosta&quot;; in French: &quot;Vallée d&#x27;Aoste&quot;); excepting the Walser-speaking valley, the villages of Gressoney-Saint-Jean, Gressoney-La-Trinité and Issime (Lys valley).
* the alpine heights of the Metropolitan City of Turin in the Piedmont basin which includes the following 43 communities: Ala di Stura, Alpette, Balme, Cantoira (Cantoire), Carema (Carême), Castagnole Piemonte, Ceres, Ceresole Reale (Cérisoles), Chialamberto (Chalambert), Chianocco (Chanoux), Coassolo Torinese, Coazze (Couasse), Condove (Condoue), Corio (Corio), Frassinetto (Frasinei), Germagnano (Saint-Germain), Giaglione (Jaillons), Giaveno, Gravere (Gravière), Groscavallo (Groscaval), Ingria, Lanzo Torinese (Lans), Lemie, Locana, Mattie, Meana di Susa (Méan), Mezzenile (Mesnil), Monastero di Lanzo (Moutier), Noasca, Novalesa (Novalaise), Pessinetto, Pont-Canavese, Ribordone (Ribardon), Ronco Canavese (Ronc), Rubiana (Rubiane), Sparone (Esparon), Susa (Suse), Traves, Usseglio (Ussel), Valgioie (Valjoie), Valprato Soana (Valpré), Venaus (Vénaux), Viù (Vieu). &quot;Note&quot;: The southernmost valleys of Piedmont speak Occitan.
* two enclaves in the Province of Foggia, Apulia region in the southern Apennine Mountains: the villages of Faeto and Celle di San Vito.

=== France ===

* the major part of Rhône-Alpes and Franche-Comté regions, which includes the following départements: Jura (southern two-thirds), Doubs (southern third), Haute-Savoie, Savoie, Isère (except the southern edge which traditionally spoke occitan), Rhône, Drôme (extreme north), Ardèche (extreme north), Loire, Ain, and Saône-et-Loire (southern edge).

=== Switzerland ===
* most of the officially French-speaking Romandie (Suisse-Romande) part of the country, including the following cantons: Geneva (Genève/Genf), Vaud, the lower part of Valais (Wallis), Fribourg (Freiburg), and Neuchâtel. &quot;Note&quot;: the remaining parts of Romandie, namely Jura, and the northern valleys of the canton Bern linguistically belong to the &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot;.

== Present status ==
The Aosta Valley is the only region of the Franco-Provençal area where this language is still widely spoken as native by all age ranges of the population. Since 1948 several events have combined to stabilize the language (Valdôtain dialect) in this region. The constitution of Italy was amended to change the status of the former province to an autonomous region. This gives the Aosta Valley special powers to make its own decisions about certain matters. This resulted in growth in the region&#x27;s economy and the population increased from 1951 to 1991, improving long-term prospects. Residents were encouraged to stay in the region and they worked to continue long-held traditions. 

The language was explicitly protected by a 1991 Italian presidential decree and a national law passed in 1999. Further, a regional law passed by the government in Aosta requires educators to promote knowledge of Franco-Provençal language and culture in the school curriculum. Several cultural groups, libraries, and theatre companies are fostering a sense of ethnic pride with their active use of the Valdôtain dialect as well (EUROPA, 2005).

Paradoxically, the same federal laws do not grant the language the same protection in the Province of Turin because there Franco-Provençal speakers make up less than 15% of the population. Lack of jobs has resulted in their migration from the Piedmont&#x27;s alpine valleys, and contributed to the language&#x27;s decline.

Switzerland does not recognize Romand (not be confused with &quot;Romansh&quot;) as one of its official languages. Speakers live in western cantons where Swiss French predominates; they converse in the dialects mainly as a second language. The use in agrarian daily life is rapidly disappearing. However, in a few isolated places the decline is considerably less steep. This is most notably the case for the Evolène dialect.

Franco-Provençal has had a precipitous decline in France. The official language of the French Republic has been designated as French (article 2 of the Constitution of France). The French government officially recognizes Franco-Provençal as one of the &quot;languages of France&quot;, but its constitution bars it from ratifying the 1992 European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (ECRML) that would guarantee certain rights to Franco-Provencal. This language has almost no political support in France and it is associated with generally low social status. This situation affects most regional languages that comprise the linguistic wealth of France. Speakers of regional languages are aging and live in mostly rural areas.

== Number of speakers ==
Franco-Provençal is currently most spoken in Aosta Valley, with Valdôtain having the greatest population of active daily speakers. A 2001 survey of 7,250 people by the Fondation Émile Chanoux revealed that 15% of all Aosta Valley residents claimed Franco-Provençal as their mother tongue, a substantial reduction to the figures reported on the Italian census 20 years earlier (and used in the 2001 European Commission report). 

At the time, 55.77% of residents said they knew Franco-provençal and 50.53% said they knew French, Franco-provençal and Italian. This opened a discussion about the concept of mother tongue when concerning a dialect. The Aosta Valley was confirmed as the only area where Franco-provençal is actively spoken in the early 21st century. A report published by Laval University in Quebec City, which analyzed this data, reports that it is &quot;probable&quot; that the language will be &quot;on the road to extinction&quot; in this region in ten years. 

In 2005, the European Commission wrote that an approximate 68,000 people spoke the language in the Aosta Valley region of Italy, according to reports compiled after the 2003 linguistic survey conducted by the Fondation Chanoux. In 2010, anthropologist and ethnologist Christiane Dunoyer proposed a much more conservative estimate of speakers in Aosta Valley at 40,000, with 20,000 using the language on a daily basis. 

In 2018, other linguistic academics estimated the number of speakers of Franco-provençal in Aosta Valley to be between 21,000 and 70,000, depending on whether one would choose the number of speakers designating Franco-provençal as their native language, or whether one included all those declaring they knew the language, irrespective of native language considerations. That same year, academic Riccardo Regis calculated that there were 50,000 Franco-provençal speakers in Aosta Valley.

The 2009 edition of ethnologue.com (Lewis, 2009) reported that there were 70,000 Franco-Provençal speakers in Italy. However, these figures are derived from the 1971 census. Outside of Aosta Valley, the alpine valleys of the adjacent province of Turin were estimated to be the home of another 22,000 speakers. Regis estimated the number of speakers in Piedmont in 2019 to be around 15,000. The Faetar and Cigliàje dialect was thought to be spoken by 1,400 people in an isolated pocket of the province of Foggia, in the southern Italian Apulia region. Beginning in 1951, strong emigration from the town of Celle Di San Vito to Canada established the Cigliàje variety of this dialect in Brantford, Ontario. At its peak, the language was used daily by several hundred people. As of 2012 this community has dwindled to fewer than 50 daily speakers across three generations.

In rural areas of the cantons of Valais and Fribourg in Switzerland, various dialects are spoken as a second language by about 7,000 residents (figures for Switzerland: Lewis, 2009). In the other cantons of Romandie where Franco-Provençal dialects used to be spoken, they are now all but extinct.

Until the mid-19th century, Franco-Provençal dialects were the most widely spoken language in their domain in France. Today, regional vernaculars are limited to a small number of speakers in secluded towns. A 2002 report by the INED (&quot;Institut national d&#x27;études démographiques&quot;) states that the language loss by generation was 90%, made up of: &quot;the proportion of fathers who did not usually speak to their 5-year-old children in the language that their own father usually spoke in to them at the same age&quot;. This was a greater loss than undergone by any other language in France, a loss called &quot;critical&quot;. The report estimated that fewer than 15,000 speakers in France were handing down some knowledge of Franco-Provençal to their children (figures for France: Héran, Filhon, &amp; Deprez, 2002; figure 1, 1-C, p. 2).

== Linguistic structure ==
Note: The overview in this section follows Martin (2005), with all Franco-Provençal examples written in accordance with &quot;Orthographe de référence B&quot; (see &quot;Orthography&quot; section, below).

=== Typology and syntax ===
* Franco-Provençal is a synthetic language, as are Occitan and Italian. Most verbs have different endings for person, number, and tenses, making the use of the pronoun optional; thus, two grammatical functions are bound together. However, the second-person singular verb form regularly requires an appropriate pronoun for distinction.
* The standard word order for Franco-Provençal is subject–verb–object (SVO) form in a declarative sentence, for example: &quot;Vos côsâds anglès.&quot; (&quot;You speak English.&quot;), except when the object is a pronoun, in which case the word order is subject–object–verb (SOV). verb–subject–object (VSO) form is standard word order for an interrogative sentence, for example: &quot;Côsâds-vos anglès ?&quot; (&quot;Do you speak English?&quot;)

=== Morphology ===
Franco-Provençal has grammar similar to that of other Romance languages.

== Phonology ==
The consonants and vowel sounds in Franco-Provençal:

=== Vowels ===
* is frequently realized as , as well as in short form when preceding a or a . 
* have a phonemic status in the dialects of Savoy, Val d&#x27;Aosta, and Lyon.

=== Consonants ===
* Affricate sounds and are mainly present in Fribourg and Valais dialects (often written as &quot;chi&quot; and &quot;gi/ji&quot;, occurring before a vowel).
* In Arles, and in some dialects of Hauteville and Savoie, the phoneme is realized as .
* In the dialects of Savoie and Bresse, phonetic dental sounds and occur corresponding to palatal sounds and . These two sounds may also be realized in dialects of Valais, where they correspond to a succeeding after a voiceless or voiced stop (like &quot;cl&quot;, &quot;gl&quot;) they are then realized as , .
*A nasal sound can occur when a nasal precedes a velar stop.
* Palatalizations of can be realized as in some Savoyard dialects.
*In rare dialects, a palatal lateral can be realized as a voiced fricative .
*A glottal fricative occurs as a result of the softening of the allophones of in Savoie and French-speaking Switzerland.
* In the dialects of Valdôtien, Fribourg, Valais, Vaudois and in some dialects of Savoyard and Dauphinois, realizations of phonemes often are heard as affricate sounds . In the dialects of French-speaking Switzerland, Valle d&#x27;Aosta, and Neuchâtel, the two palatal stops are realized as the affricates, .
* The placement of stressed syllables in the spoken language is a primary characteristic of Franco-Provençal that distinguishes it from French and Occitan. Franco-Provençal words take stress on the last syllable, as in French, or on the penultimate syllable, unlike French.
* Franco-Provençal also preserves final vowel sounds, in particular &quot;a&quot; in feminine forms and &quot;o&quot; in masculine forms (where it is pronounced &quot;ou&quot; in some regions.) The word &quot;portar&quot; is pronounced or , with accent on the final &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot;, but &quot;rousa&quot; is pronounced , with accent on the &quot;ou&quot;.
*Vowels followed by nasal consonants &quot;&#x27;&quot; and &quot;&#x27;&quot; are normally nasalized in a similar manner to those in French, for example, and &#x27; in Franco-Provençal, and &quot;chanter&quot; and &quot; in French. However, in the largest part of the Franco-Provençal domain, nasalized vowels retain a timbre that more closely approaches the un-nasalized vowel sound than in French, for example, &#x27; and in Franco-Provençal, compared to &quot; and &quot;&quot; in French.

== Orthography ==
There is no single official standard that covers Franco-Provençal as a whole. The orthographies in use include the following:

* The one used by Aimé Chenal and Raymond Vautherin, who wrote the first comprehensive grammar and dictionary for any variety of Franco-Provençal. Their landmark effort greatly expands upon the work by Jean-Baptiste Cerlogne begun in the 19th century on the Valdôtain (Valdotèn) dialect of the Aosta Valley. It was published in twelve volumes from 1967 to 1982.
* The one used by the &quot;Bureau régional pour l&#x27;ethnologie et la linguistique&quot; (BREL) in Aosta and the &quot;Centre d&#x27;études franco-provençales&quot; « &quot;René Willien&quot; » (CEFP) in Saint-Nicolas, Italy. It is based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Cerlogne, albeit with several modifications.
* The &quot;Graphie de Conflans&quot;, which has achieved fairly wide acceptance among speakers residing in Bresse and Savoy. Since it was first proposed by the &quot;Groupe de Conflans&quot; in 1983, it has appeared in many published works. This method perhaps most closely follows the International Phonetic Alphabet, omitting extraneous letters found in other historical and contemporary proposals. It features the use of a combining low line (underscore) as a diacritic to indicate a stressed vowel in the penult when it occurs, for example: &quot;toma&quot;, &quot;déssanta&quot;.
* The &quot;Orthographe de référence B&quot;, or ORB, devised by linguist Dominique Stich. It is the only orthography intended to represent all Franco-Provençal dialects. It strays from a close representation of various local pronunciations, instead opting for more diaphonemic and etymological spellings, with frequent influence from French. There are two subtypes of ORB: &quot;large&quot; (&quot;broad&quot;), namely spellings intended to represent all dialects; and &quot;serrée&quot; (&quot;narrow&quot;), namely spellings modified to represent certain local features. For instance the descendant of Latin &quot;festa&quot; is given as &quot;féta&quot; in &quot;broad&quot; spelling and &quot;fétha&quot; in &quot;narrow&quot; spelling for a number of dialects where Latin [st] underwent metathesis to *[ts] and then developed to modern [θ].
The table below compares a few words in each writing system, with French and English for reference. (Sources: Esprit Valdôtain (download 7 March 2007), C.C.S. Conflans (1995), and Stich (2003).

== Numerals ==
Franco-Provençal uses a decimal counting system. The numbers &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;4&quot; have masculine and feminine forms (Duplay, 1896; Viret, 2006).

0) &quot;zérô&quot;; 1) &quot;yon&quot; , &quot;yona / yena&quot; ; 2) &quot;dos&quot; , &quot;does / doves / davè&quot; ; 3) &quot;três&quot;; 4) &quot;quatro&quot; , &quot;quat / quatrè&quot; ; 5) &quot;cinq&quot;; 6) &quot;siéx&quot;; 7) &quot;sèpt&quot;; 8) &quot;huét&quot;; 9) &quot;nô&quot;; 10) &quot;diéx&quot;; 11) &quot;onze&quot;&#x27;; 12) &quot;doze&quot;; 13) &quot;trèze&quot;; 14) &quot;quatôrze&quot;; 15) &quot;quinze&quot;; 16) &quot;sèze&quot;; 17) &quot;dix-sèpt&quot;; 18) &quot;dix-huét&quot;; 19) &quot;dix-nou&quot;; 20) ; 21) / ; 22) ... 30) &quot;trenta&quot;; 40) &quot;quaranta&quot;; 50) &quot;cinquanta&quot;; 60) &quot;souessanta&quot;; 70) &quot;sèptanta&quot;; 80) &quot;huétanta&quot;; 90) &quot;nonanta&quot;; 100) &quot;cent&quot;; 1000) &quot;mila&quot;; 1,000,000) .

Many western dialects use a vigesimal (base-20) form for &quot;80&quot;, that is, &quot;quatro-vingt&quot; , possibly due to the influence of French.

== Word comparisons ==
The chart below compares words in Franco-Provençal to those in selected Romance languages, with English for reference.

Between vowels, the Latinate &quot;p&quot; became &quot;v&quot;, &quot;c&quot; and &quot;g&quot; became &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;t&quot; and &quot;d&quot; disappeared. Franco-Provençal also softened the hard palatized &quot;c&quot; and &quot;g&quot; before &quot;a&quot;. This led Franco-Provençal to evolve down a different path from Occitan and Gallo-Iberian languages, closer to the evolutionary direction taken by French.

== Dialects ==
Classification of Franco-Provençal dialect divisions is challenging. Each canton and valley uses its own vernacular without standardization. Difficult intelligibility among dialects was noted as early as 1807 by Grillet.

The dialects are divided into eight distinct categories or groups. Six &quot;dialect groups&quot; comprising 41 &quot;dialect idioms&quot; for the Franco-Provençal language have been identified and documented by Linguasphere Observatory (Observatoire Linguistique) (Dalby, 1999/2000, pp. 402–403). Only two dialect groups – Lyonnaise and Dauphinois-N. – were recorded as having fewer than 1,000 speakers each. Linguasphere has not listed any dialect idiom as &quot;extinct&quot;, however, many are highly endangered. A seventh isolated dialect group, consisting of Faetar (also known as &quot;Cigliàje&quot; or &quot;Cellese&quot;), has been analyzed by Nagy (2000). The Piedmont dialects need further study.

== Dialect examples ==
Several modern orthographic variations exist for all dialects of Franco-Provençal. The spellings and IPA equivalents listed below appear in Martin (2005).

== Toponyms ==
Other than in family names, the Franco-Provençal legacy survives primarily in placenames. Many are immediately recognizable, ending in . These suffixes are vestiges of an old medieval orthographic practice indicating the stressed syllable of a word. In polysyllables, &#x27;z&#x27; indicates a paroxytone (stress on penultimate syllable) and &#x27;x&#x27; indicates an oxytone (stress on last syllable). So, Chanaz (&quot;shana&quot;) but Chênex (&quot;shèné&quot;). The following is a list of all such toponyms:

== Literature ==

A long tradition of Franco-Provençal literature exists, although no prevailing written form of the language has materialized. An early 12th-century fragment containing 105 verses from a poem about Alexander the Great may be the earliest known work in the language. &quot;Girart de Roussillon&quot;, an epic with 10,002 lines from the mid-12th century, has been asserted to be Franco-Provençal. It certainly contains prominent Franco-Provençal features, although the editor of an authoritative edition of this work claims that the language is a mixture of French and Occitan forms. A significant document from the same period containing a list of vassals in the County of Forez also is not without literary value.

Among the first historical writings in Franco-Provençal are legal texts by civil law notaries that appeared in the 13th century as Latin was being abandoned for official administration. These include a translation of the (known as the &quot;Justinian Code&quot;) in the vernacular spoken in Grenoble. Religious works also were translated and conceived in Franco-Provençal dialects at some monasteries in the region. &quot;The Legend of Saint Bartholomew&quot; is one such work that survives in Lyonnais patois from the 13th century.

Marguerite d&#x27;Oingt (–1310), prioress of a Carthusian nunnery near Mionnay (France), composed two remarkable sacred texts in her native Lyonnais dialect, in addition to her writings in Latin. The first, entitled &quot;Speculum &quot;(&quot;The Mirror&quot;), describes three miraculous visions and their meanings. The other work, &quot;Li Via seiti Biatrix, virgina de Ornaciu&quot; (&quot;The Life of the Blessed Virgin Beatrix d&#x27;Ornacieux&quot;), is a long biography of a nun and mystic consecrated to the Passion whose faith lead to a devout cult. This text contributed to the beatification of the nun more than 500 years later by Pope Pius IX in 1869. A line from the work in her dialect follows:

: § 112 : « &quot;Quant vit co li diz vicayros que ay o coventavet fayre, ce alyet cela part et en ot mout de dongiers et de travayl, ancis que cil qui gardont lo lua d&#x27;Emuet li volissant layssyer co que il demandavet et que li evesques de Valenci o volit commandar. Totes veys yses com Deus o aveyt ordonat oy se fit.&quot; »

Religious conflicts in Geneva between Calvinist Reformers and staunch Catholics, supported by the Duchy of Savoy, brought forth many texts in Franco-Provençal during the early 17th century. One of the best known is &quot;Cé qu&#x27;è lainô&quot; (&quot;The One Above&quot;), which was composed by an unknown writer in 1603. The long narrative poem describes l&#x27;Escalade, a raid by the Savoyard army that generated patriotic sentiments. It became the unofficial national anthem of the Republic of Geneva. The first three verses follow below (in Genevois dialect) with a translation:


Several writers created satirical, moralistic, poetic, comic, and theatrical texts during the era that followed, which indicates the vitality of the language at that time. These include: Bernardin Uchard (1575–1624), author and playwright from Bresse; Henri Perrin, comic playwright from Lyon; Jean Millet (1600?–1675), author of pastorals, poems, and comedies from Grenoble; Jacques Brossard de Montaney (1638–1702), writer of comedies and carols from Bresse; (1647–1694), priest and composer of more than 1,500 carols, songs, epistles, and essays from Saint-Étienne; and (1690–1742), writer of prose poems, including &quot;Grenoblo maléirou&quot; about the great flood of 1733 in Grenoble. 19th century authors include Guillaume Roquille (1804–1860), working-class poet from Rive-de-Gier near Saint-Chamond, (1805–1872), physician, poet, and songwriter from Rumilly, and (1818–1880) of Gruyères. Clair Tisseur (1827–1896), architect of Bon-Pasteur Church in Lyon, published many writings under the pen name &quot;Nizier du Puitspelu&quot;. These include a popular dictionary and humorous works in Lyonnaise dialect that have reprinted for more than 100 years.

Amélie Gex (1835–1883) wrote in her native &quot;patois&quot; as well as French. She was a passionate advocate for her language. Her literary efforts encompassed lyrical themes, work, love, tragic loss, nature, the passing of time, religion, and politics, and are considered by many to be the most significant contributions to the literature. Among her works are: &quot;Reclans de Savoué&quot; (&quot;Echos from Savoy&quot;, 1879), &quot;Lo cent ditons de Pierre d&#x27;Emo&quot; (&quot;One Hundred Sayings by Pierre du Bon-Sens&quot;, 1879), &quot;Poesies&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;, 1880), &quot;Vieilles gens et vieilles choses: Histoires de ma rue et de mon village&quot; (&quot;Old people and old things: Stories from my street and from my village&quot;, 1889), &quot;Fables&quot; (1898), and &quot;Contio de la Bova&quot; (&quot;Tales from the Cowshed&quot;).

The writings of the &quot;abbé&quot; Jean-Baptiste Cerlogne (1826–1910) are credited with reestablishing the cultural identity of the Aosta Valley. His early poetry includes: (1855), &quot;Marenda a Tsesalet&quot; (1856) and &quot;La bataille di vatse a Vertosan&quot; (1858); among his scholarly works are: &quot;Petite grammaire du dialecte valdotain&quot; (1893), &quot;Dictionnaire du dialecte valdôtain&quot; (1908) and &quot;Le patois valdotain: son origine littéraire et sa graphie&quot; (1909). The Concours Cerlogne – an annual event named in his honor – has focused thousands of Italian students on preserving the region&#x27;s language, literature, and heritage since 1963.

At the end of the 19th century, regional dialects of Franco-Provençal were disappearing due to the expansion of the French language into all walks of life and the emigration of rural people to urban centers. Cultural and regional savant societies began to collect oral folk tales, proverbs, and legends from native speakers in an effort that continues to today. Numerous works have been published.

 (1852–1933), the bard of Bresse; Louis Mercier (1870–1951), folk singer and author of more than twelve volumes of prose from Coutouvre near Roanne; Just Songeon (1880–1940), author, poet, and activist from La Combe, Sillingy near Annecy; (1896–1983), poet from Aosta; and (1896–1961) of Gruyères whose complete works were published in &quot;Kan la têra tsantè&quot; (&quot;When the earth sang&quot;), are well known for their use of patois in the 20th century.
Louis des Ambrois de Nevache, from Upper Susa Valley, transcribed popular songs and wrote some original poetry in local
patois.
There are compositions in the current language on the album Enfestar, an artistic project from Piedmont

The first comic book in a Franco-Provençal dialect, &quot;Le rebloshon que tyouè!&quot; (&quot;The cheese that killed!&quot;), from the &quot;Fanfoué des Pnottas&quot; series by Félix Meynet, appeared in 2000. Two popular works from &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; and one from the Lucky Luke series were published in Franco-Provençal translations for young readers in 2006 and 2007.

<text>Richard L. &quot;Rick&quot; Adams, Jr. is an American Internet pioneer. He is known as the founder of UUNET, which, in the mid and late 1990s, was the world&#x27;s largest Internet Service Provider (ISP). In 1997, his fortune was estimated at $500 million.

==Early life and education==
He obtained a master&#x27;s degree in computer science from Purdue University. 

==Career==
Adams was responsible for the first widely available Serial Line IP (SLIP) implementation and founding UUNET, which is known for helping make the internet widely accessible. In 1982 he ran the first international UUCP e-mail link, known as &quot;Seismo&quot;, at the Center for Seismic Studies in Northern Virginia), which evolved into the first (UUCP-based) UUNET. He maintained B News (at that time the most popular Usenet News transport).

In 1996, he donated one million dollars U.S. to the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) to be used as the basis for its One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge. He is the JREF&#x27;s treasurer.

Adams co-authored the O&#x27;Reilly book &quot;!%@:: A Directory of Electronic Mail Addressing &amp; Networks&quot; with his wife Donnalyn Frey in 1994. He is a co-author of RFC 1036, the Standard for Interchange of USENET Messages.

=== Creation of SLIP ===
In the early 1980s, 3Com&#x27;s UNET Unix system could exchange TCP/IP traffic over serial lines. In 1984 Adams implemented this system on Berkeley Unix 4.2 and dubbed it SLIP. The SLIP protocol was documented in RFC 1055.

The SLIP protocol was superseded in the early 1990s, by the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which is still in use.

=== Founding UUNET ===
Adams founded a nonprofit telecommunications company, UUNET Communications Service, to reduce the cost of mail and Usenet traffic sent by UUCP, particularly for rural sites in America. (UUNET was founded with a $50,000 loan from the USENIX Association, which was subsequently repaid.) UUNET became an official gateway between UUCP mail and Internet email, as well as between North America and Europe. It hosted many related services, such as Internet FTP access for its UUCP clients and the comp.sources.unix archives.

Adams spun out a for-profit company, UUNET Technologies, which was the first ISP in the United States. The for-profit company bought the assets of the nonprofit, repaying it with a share of the profits over the years. The nonprofit has spent that money for many UNIX-related charitable causes over the years, such as supporting the Internet Software Consortium. The for-profit ISP became a multibillion-dollar company and made an initial public offering in 1995. It was acquired by MFS (Metropolitan Fiber Systems, a wide-area optical-networking company), in 1996, which was subsequently acquired by Worldcom, which rose to challenge the largest telecommunications companies in America.

Adams left UUNET after transitioning leadership of the company to John Sidgmore in 1994. After leaving UUNET, Adams pursued opportunities as a partner in other ventures, including Cello Recording Studios and the 2941 Restaurant in Falls Church, Virginia.

=== Cello Recording Studios ===
In 1999 Adams purchased the &quot;Western Studio&quot; portion of Ocean Way Recording Studios in Hollywood, California from Alan Sides and renamed it Cello Studios. Notable artists recorded at Cello Studios such as Weezer, Rage Against The Machine, Macy Gray, Blink 182 and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Cello Studios continued under Adams&#x27; ownership until January 2005, when the business abruptly closed and filed for bankruptcy. The vacant building, threatened with demolition, was sold and reopened as EastWest Studios in 2009.

==Personal life==
, he resided in Northern Virginia with his wife Donnalyn and their two sons.

<text>Ugley is a small village and civil parish in the non-metropolitan district of Uttlesford in Essex, England. It is about north from Stansted Mountfitchet, and situated between Saffron Walden and Bishop&#x27;s Stortford. Within the parish is the village of Ugley Green, to the south. 

Ugley was first recorded in 1041 as &quot;Uggele&quot;. It appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Ugghelea&quot;, in the ancient hundred of Claverling. The name probably means &quot;woodland clearing of a man named Ugga.&quot;

Within Ugley there are several buildings of the 16th and 17th centuries. The Grade II* listed church, St Peter&#x27;s, has a 13th-century nave and a Tudor brick tower. Orford House is a Grade II* listed building built by Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford, c.1700.

The village&#x27;s name has been noted on lists of unusual place names. There have been many claims of the existence of an Ugley Women’s Institute, seemingly without strong confirmatory evidence.

==Cycling==
There is a cycling time trial course which starts close to Ugley. The village is home to several bungalows or &quot;huts&quot; owned by long-established cycling clubs based in Essex and Greater London.

<doc id="465930" wikidata="Q976335" url="?curid=465930" title="Purple triangle">
<text>The purple triangle was a concentration camp badge used by the Nazis to identify Bibelforsher (that is Bible Student movement and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses) in Nazi Germany. The purple triangle was introduced in July 1936 with other concentration camps such as those of Dachau and Buchenwald following in 1937 and 1938. In the winter of 1935–36, before the onset of the war, Jehovah’s Witnesses have been reported to make up 20–40% of the prisoners in concentration camps. Although Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses made up the vast majority of those wearing the purple triangle (over 99%), a few members of other small pacifist religious groups were also included.

==Background==

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses came into conflict with the Nazi regime because they refused to use the Hitler salute, which conflicted with their beliefs. Because refusing to use the Hitler salute was considered a crime, they were arrested, and their children attending school were expelled, detained and separated from their families. When Germany made military enlistment mandatory, they were persecuted because they refused to bear arms. Being politically neutral, they also refused to vote in the elections.

Based on the Nuremberg Laws, those who were also classified as ethnic Jews wore a badge comprising a purple triangle superimposed on a yellow triangle.

<doc id="465931" wikidata="Q164750" url="?curid=465931" title="Jony Ive">
<text>Sir Jonathan Paul Ive (born 27 February 1967) is a British-American designer. He is best known for his work at Apple Inc., where he was senior vice president of industrial design and chief design officer. He has been chancellor of the Royal College of Art in London since 2017.

Ive joined Apple in September 1992, and was promoted to senior vice president of industrial design in the late 1990s after the return of the co-founder, Steve Jobs. He was Chief Design Officer from 2015,until his departure in July 2019. Working closely with Jobs, Ive played a vital role in the designs of products including the iMac, Power Mac G4 Cube, iPod, iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and the user interface of Apple&#x27;s mobile operating system iOS. He was also responsible for the design of major architectural projects including Apple Park and Apple Stores.

Born in London, Ive lived there until his family moved to Stafford when he was 12. He studied design at Newcastle Polytechnic, and later joined the London-based design firm Tangerine, where he worked on client projects for LG and Ideal Standard as well as Apple. After leaving Tangerine to join Apple full time, he began designing the decade&#x27;s PowerBooks and Macs. He acquired US citizenship in 2012. He was invited to join the Royal College of Art in May 2017 as its head of college, serving a fixed five-year term until May 2022.

Ive has received accolades and honours for his designs and patents. In the United Kingdom, he has been appointed a Royal Designer for Industry (RDI), an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (HonFREng), and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). In 2018, he was awarded the Hawking Fellowship of the Cambridge Union Society. In a 2004 BBC poll of cultural writers, Ive was ranked the most influential person in British culture. His designs have been described as integral to the successes of Apple, the world&#x27;s largest information technology company by revenue and the largest company in the world by market capitalization. In 2019, Ive announced he his departure from Apple after 27 years to start his own design firm, LoveFrom, with the industrial designer Marc Newson. In 2021, he was recruited by the Agnelli family to work on Ferrari vehicles.

==Early life and education==
Jonathan Paul Ive was born on 27 February 1967 in Chingford, London, United Kingdom. His father, Michael Ive, was a silversmith who lectured at Middlesex Polytechnic, and his grandfather was an engineer. While attending secondary school, he was diagnosed with dyslexia.

According to a March 2014 interview with &quot;Time&quot;, Ive was inspired to become a designer by his teenage love of cars. He investigated car design courses in London, including one at the Royal College of Art, but was repelled by the students: &quot;The classes were full of students making vroom! vroom! noises as they drew.&quot;

Ive studied industrial design at Newcastle Polytechnic, where he was introduced to a form of Germanic design which originated at the Bauhaus. The Bauhaus expressed the idea of only including what is needed into designs. This philosophy can be seen in his work with Apple. While at Newcastle, some of his designs – including a telephone and a hearing aid – were exhibited at the Design Museum in London. He graduated with a first class Bachelor of Arts in 1989.

==Career==
Ive&#x27;s designs at polytechnic garnered him the RSA Student Design Award in 1988 and 1989, which afforded him a small stipend and a travel expense account to use on a trip to the United States. He travelled to San Francisco, where he met designers including Robert Brunner, who ran a small consultancy firm that would later join Apple Computer. After returning to England six weeks later, Ive interned at the product design agency Roberts Weaver Group (his college sponsor), where he impressed executives with his attention to detail and work ethic.

=== Tangerine ===
After a year with Roberts Weaver, Ive joined a London-based design agency, Tangerine, in Hoxton Square. He designed a diverse array of products, such as microwave ovens, toilets, drills and toothbrushes for clients including LG and Ideal Standard. However, he became frustrated after he designed a toilet, bidet, and sink for Ideal Standard, and the company rejected the work, stating that the products were too costly and looked too modern. He became unhappy with his clients who had different ideas.

From 1990 to 1992, Brunner tried to recruit Ive to Apple. During this time, Apple became a client of Tangerine. Ive worked on &quot;Project Juggernaut&quot; for Apple, investigating the future of portable computers and setting the stage for what would become the PowerBook.

=== Apple ===
He was formally recruited to Apple as a full-time employee in September 1992. Ive was initially apprehensive about joining Apple given the move from the UK to California. His first major assignment in Apple&#x27;s Industrial Design Group regarded the second generation of the Newton and the MessagePad 110. A lack of emphasis on design during the early 1990s prompted Ive to consider quitting.

Steve Jobs, who left in 1985 after being pushed away by John Sculley, was staging a return to the company and recruited Ive to join him in taking the firm in a different direction. Jon Rubinstein, Ive&#x27;s boss at the time, managed to retain Ive as an employee by explaining that Apple was &quot;going to make history&quot; under Jobs in 1996.

Ive became the senior vice president of industrial design in 1997 heading up the industrial design team responsible for most of the company&#x27;s significant hardware products. Ive&#x27;s first assignment in this capacity was the iMac, introduced in 1998 (he is credited with designing its translucent plastic case). The iMac helped pave the way for many other designs such as the iPod and eventually the iPhone and the iPad. Ive described his rapport with Jobs in 2014: &quot;When we were looking at objects, what our eyes physically saw and what we came to perceive were exactly the same. And we would ask the same questions, have the same curiosity about things.&quot; Ive became the first human to make a public phone call with Jobs after he introduced the iPhone on 9 January 2007. It was reported that Ive&#x27;s desire for keeping the products as thin as possible may have led to the mechanically fragile butterfly keyboard and removing the Magsafe power connector, HDMI port, and SD card reader from the MacBook.

Ive was given his own design office at Apple during the early 2000s in which he oversaw the work of his appointed design team, and he was the only Apple designer with a private office. Only his core team—which consisted of around 15 people from the UK, the US, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand (who had worked together for around two decades)—and top Apple executives were allowed into the office, because it contained all of the concepts, including prototypes, that the design team was working on. Ive did not allow his children to enter the office. 

Jobs described Ive as his &quot;spiritual partner at Apple&quot;, stating that

The difference that Jony has made, not only at Apple but in the world, is huge. He is a wickedly intelligent person in all ways. He understands business concepts, marketing concepts. He picks stuff up just like that, click. He understands what we do at our core better than anyone. If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it&#x27;s Jony. Jony and I think up most of the products together and then pull others in and say, &#x27;Hey, what do you think about this?&#x27; He gets the big picture as well as the most infinitesimal details about each product. And he understands that Apple is a product company. He&#x27;s not just a designer. That&#x27;s why he works directly for me. He has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me. There&#x27;s no one who can tell him what to do, or to butt out. That&#x27;s the way I set it up.

The offices of Jobs and Ive in Apple&#x27;s Cupertino headquarters were linked by a covered corridor. Ive delivered the eulogy for Steve at both the Apple employee memorial service and the family service.

In 2011 it was reported that Ive was paid $30 million in base salary with a $25 million stock bonus for the year. His compensation ceased to be publicly disclosed by the firm thereafter, rendering him the only Apple executive to be afforded such as provision. A year later it was estimated that his net worth was £80 million.

On 29 October 2012, Apple announced that Ive would &quot;provide leadership and direction for Human Interface (HI) across the company in addition to his role as the leader of Industrial Design.&quot; With the 2013 World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) announcement of iOS 7 and Ive&#x27;s role as principal, Apple press information was also updated to reflect his new title: senior vice president of design. In the same press update, Ive stated that he hoped his best work was yet to emerge and that he preferred to be identified as a maker of products, rather than a designer. On 26 May 2015, the firm announced that Ive was promoted to chief design officer (CDO), at the time one of only three C-level executives at Apple along with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri (Jeff Williams would be promoted to COO at the end of 2015). On 8 December 2017, Apple announced that Ive would resume direct responsibility for the company&#x27;s product design.

===LoveFrom===
Apple announced on 27 June 2019 that Ive would depart the company, stating that he would start an independent firm named LoveFrom, along with fellow designer Marc Newson, that would work with Apple as its primary client. LoveFrom is known to keep a low profile. Partners in LoveFrom include Marc Newson and Peter Saville. LoveFrom unveiled a minimalistic website in October 2021. In July 2022, the consulting agreement with Apple was ended, thus ending Ive&#x27;s relationship with the company. LoveFrom works with a number of brands including Ferrari and Airbnb. Ive is close friends with Airbnb chief executive Brian Chesky. Through Terra Carta Design Lab in 2021 and his coronation in 2023, Ive produced designs for Charles III. In 2023, Ive led the development of a foldable red nose for Comic Relief. In 2024, it was reported that LoveFrom was working with tech firm OpenAI to develop hardware focused on artificial intelligence, though details are scarce. 

=== Royal College of Art ===
Ive received an honorary degree from the Royal College of Art (RCA) in 2009. On 25 May 2017, Ive was appointed Chancellor of the RCA in London, effective 1 July 2017, succeeding Sir James Dyson. In this position he serves a fixed five-year term as the Head of college, where he will govern the college as an academic administrator. Ive began running committee meetings, attending faculty meetings, and conferring degrees in the summer of 2017. Ive said of the appointment: &quot;I am thrilled to formalise my relationship with the RCA, given the profound influence the college has had on so many of the artists and designers that I admire.&quot; Ive was still chancellor in January 2023.

== Public image ==

Ive is known for his minimalist, downplayed sense of style and presentation of self. Chief among his public image is his &quot;nearly shaved head and tightly trimmed beard&quot;. It is estimated that Ive first shaved his head in a tight buzzcut and coupled it with stubble when, in 2001, aged 34, he was promoted to vice president of industrial design at Apple. His look had him referred to as one of the &quot;100 Most Powerful Bald Men in the World&quot; by &quot;GQ&quot; in their 2013 listing. Known for its minimalist look, it has inspired Halloween costumes, grooming regimens, and a small-scale fashion movement, among other things.

He has been known to sport &quot;signature looks&quot; that include: multi-colored &quot;pied-de-poule&quot; suits, painter&#x27;s pants, canvas pants, linen button down shirts, Clarks Wallabees, and mono-colored t-shirts. His favorite tailor is reportedly British clothier Thomas Mahon. Ive&#x27;s voice, used in Apple&#x27;s marketing and promotional videos since 1994, has been noted for its Essex accent and reserved style of speech.

== Influences ==

The work and principles of Dieter Rams, the chief designer of Braun from 1961 until 1995, influenced Ive&#x27;s work. In Gary Hustwit&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Objectified&quot; (2009), Rams says that Apple is one of only a handful of companies existing today that design products according to his ten principles of good design. Ive contributed an essay to a 2011 Rams monograph, &quot;Dieter Rams: As Little Design as Possible&quot;.

He is also said to have been influenced by the Bauhaus tradition (known for its credos form follows function and less is more), which emerged in Germany during the 1920s and became a staple design approach adopted by the Ulm School of Design during the 1950s. The Bauhaus / Ulm design style was also adopted during the 1980s by luxury automotive brand Audi, which also influenced Jonathan Ive&#x27;s designs (particularly his work with Apple), and has garnered comparisons in color stencil, structure, and lighting design.

== Personal life ==
While he was attending secondary school at Walton High School in Stafford he met his future wife, British writer Heather Pegg in 1987. They have two sons. His family resides in the Pacific Heights neighbourhood of San Francisco, California. Their home was purchased for US$17 million in 2012. While at Apple, Ive commuted an hour and a half from San Francisco to Cupertino every day. He said in 2014 that if his work at Apple ever became substandard, he would &quot;make things for [himself], for [his] friends at home instead&quot;. Ive also owns a house in the Cotswolds.

According to the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; in 2019, Ive was worth an estimated £192 million.

Ive is known to live a reserved, private home life; he shuns publicity.

=== Automobiles ===
Since his early years in England, Ive has expressed an interest in automobiles and automotive design. While in university he drove a Fiat 500. He frequently attends auto shows and exhibitions such as the Goodwood Festival of Speed, where he serves as a jury member for competitions.

It has been reported that Ive&#x27;s preferred carmakers were all once-British: Aston Martin, Bentley, and Land Rover. Ive has been linked to owning an Aston Martin DB4, Aston Martin DB9, Aston Martin Vanquish, Bentley Brooklands, Bentley Mulsanne, Land Rover Discovery 3, and a Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud.

==Charity work and public service==

Ive has designed products for charitable causes, including a one-off Leica camera that set a world record auction price and a Jaeger-LeCoultre sports watch — one of only three — for an HIV/AIDS charity. During this auction, Ive and fellow designer Marc Newson raised $13 million for Bono&#x27;s Product Red charity. With matching from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and additional matching from the UK and US Governments, the total raised was $46 million.

In 2023, Ive redesigned the Red Nose, the symbol of Comic Relief&#x27;s Red Nose day, sold to raise money for charity. He also designed the emblem for the coronation of Charles III, which features a rose, thistle, daffodil, and shamrock— traditional symbols representing the four parts of the United Kingdom – in the shape of St Edward&#x27;s Crown. Ive described the choice of these flowers as being &quot;inspired by King Charles&#x27;s love of the planet, nature, and his deep concern for the natural world,&quot; and that it is intended to refer to the &quot;optimism of spring&quot;.

In 2023, LoveFrom announced its own scholarship programme, which is aimed at increasing representation in the design industry by supporting designers from all backgrounds. The programme covers the full tuition of a student at the California College of the Art, the Rhode Island School of Design and two students at the Royal College of Art each year.

==Honors and awards==

Throughout his career at Apple, Ive has received nominations and garnered awards for his work. He has been appointed a Royal Designer for Industry (RDI), an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (HonFREng), a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2006 and Knight Commander of the same Order (KBE) in 2012. He has received honorary degrees from the Rhode Island School of Design and California College of the Arts, and made an honorary doctor of the Royal College of Art. On successive Wednesdays in June 2016, Ive was awarded honorary doctorates at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford. In 2004, he was named the &quot;Most Influential Person on British Culture&quot; in a BBC poll of cultural writers.

<text>Wanning, or in local Hainanese dialect as Ban Ning, is a county-level city in the southeast of Hainan Province, China. Although called a &quot;city&quot;, Wanning refers to both the county seat and to the entire county as a whole. The county-wide area has an estimated population of 65,871 (2006).

==History==
Wanning () first got its current name during the Southern Song dynasty, after being renamed from Wan&#x27;an (). Wanning was later renamed back to Wan&#x27;an in 1143 until its name was changed to Wanzhou () in 1370, but subsequently reverted to its present name after the Communist takeover in the 1950s. It was promoted from a county to a city on August 5, 1996.

==Economy==
Tourism plays a vital role in the city. Famous for its tropical scenery, Wanning proper lies approximately half an hour&#x27;s drive from the beach and has several five-star hotels. The city of Wanning produces coffee, black pepper, rubber, rice, bananas, and sugarcane.

== Transportation ==
Wanning is served by the Wanning Railway Station, part of the Hainan East Ring Intercity Rail.

==Climate==
Wanning has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen: &quot;Am&quot;), falling just short of a tropical rainforest climate, as it is hot and very rainy most of the year. Only January and February have rainfall barely below . The rainfall is more pronounced during the monsoon season, which runs through late June to early November. At times, it can become cold with temperatures between 5 and 8 degrees Celsius.

<doc id="465934" wikidata="Q3091139" url="?curid=465934" title="Hakim rifle">
<text>The Hakim rifle is a gas-operated semi-automatic rifle. It was originally designed by Sweden and produced as the Ag m/42 for the Swedish Army. The tooling and design were later sold to Egypt, and the Hakim was produced there during the 1950s and early 1960s. It was replaced in the mid-1960s by the Maadi AK-47 (a licensed copy of the Soviet rifle) but was stored in military reserve arsenals. In more recent years, it has been observed in use by some Egyptian police units. Around 70,000 were made.

A shortened carbine version of this rifle called the Rasheed was manufactured in limited numbers in Egypt using the smaller 7.62x39mm cartridge.

Due to its age, the Hakim is designated as a curio and relic firearm by the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

== History ==
&quot;The Hakim,&quot; an Arabic term signifying &quot;judge, ruler, or governor,&quot; refers to an enhanced Egyptian iteration of the Swedish Automatgevär m/42. After the 1952 Egyptian revolution, General Gamal Abdul Nasser initiated a campaign to modernize the Egyptian military. This involved procuring manufacturing equipment and initial technical support from Sweden to construct an Egyptian variant of the Ag m/42. This marked the inception of Egypt&#x27;s domestic small-arms industry.

A total of around 70,000 rifles would be produced.

==Design==
Egypt introduced an adjustable gas operated system, whereas the Ag m/42 had been non-adjustable. The Hakim system is adjustable by use of a special tool and is a simple, direct impingement type whereby the flow of gas impacts directly on the front face of the bolt carrier, propelling it to the rear, which unlocks and moves the bolt as it does so. The Hakim features a Tokarev-pattern tipping bolt system as used in the FN-49, SKS and MAS-49 rifles.

While the Ag m/42 fired the 6.5×55mm cartridge, Egypt owned large stockpiles of 8×57mm Mauser ammunition, much of it left behind from World War II. To take advantage of the large stockpile, the Hakim was further re-engineered to accept the larger cartridge, which also necessitated the addition of a permanent, non removable muzzle brake to help reduce the concurrent greater recoil. Some internet sites have incorrectly referred to this as a flash suppressor; the two are distinctly different features that serve entirely different functions: a muzzle brake is designed to reduce recoil (thereby reducing stress on the operator, as well as wear on the rifle itself), whereas a flash suppressor is designed to reduce the bright muzzle flash so that it does not blind the operator when firing in dark conditions.

The Hakim features a 10-round detachable magazine intended to be loaded from the top breech with 5-round stripper clips. Though it is possible to modify magazines designed for the MG13 to fit and be used in the Hakim, bringing its capacity to 25.

<doc id="465938" wikidata="Q554325" url="?curid=465938" title="Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus">
<text>Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus was a Roman general and statesman, who served as consul of the Roman Republic in 256 and 250 BC. He is remembered for his military successes; his military achievements, especially the Battle of Cape Ecnomus, which significantly contributed to the victory of the Romans in the First Punic War.

==Career==
During Lucius’ mature life, he ran for the consulate several times, succeeding twice. On both occasions he ended up leading military expeditions. The term for being consul was one year. Two consuls ruled at a time and one could serve up to two terms. It was the consuls’ job to govern provinces, lead armies in major wars, and run the Senate and assemblies.

He ran in 259 BC, but lost to Lucius Cornelius Scipio. After this, he successfully ran in 256 and 250 BC. In 256, he ruled with Marcus Atilius Regulus and in 250 with Gaius Atilius Regulus. In 256, Lucius and Marcus Atilius Regulus sailed to Africa during the First Punic War to fight Carthage—see Battle of Cape Ecnomus. Rome had prepared a large fleet of 330 ships and 140,000 men (100,000 crew and 40,000 soldiers), Carthage had a slightly larger fleet of 350 ships and 150,000 men. The Romans sailed in battle formation with three squadrons. Two of the squadrons, commanded by the consuls Marcus Atilius Regulus and Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus, led the way. The other squadron was in the back protecting the horse-transport ships that were between them. They sailed in a triangular shape because of the strong base that was easy to support during battle and also difficult to break up.

The Carthaginians were positioned in a long horizontal line with Hamilcar in the center and two slightly advanced sides. The two Carthaginian flanks advanced, which left the main line alone. This line was immediately targeted because of its vulnerability. The first two squadrons were the main ships to fight the center of the Carthaginian fleet. Since the soldiers were fighting under both consuls, who were taking part in the battle in person, they felt even more encouraged to fight with their entire strength and defeated the Carthaginians after an extensive fight. After, the squadrons went to relieve the back of the fleet. Vulso&#x27;s squadron went after the Carthaginian left wing that was attacking the transport ships, while Regulus attacked Hanno. Saving these transport ships was essential to the Romans&#x27; later victories at Aspis because these ships contained horses for the cavalry and extra food and supplies which were necessary for fighting on land. After the battle, about half of Carthage&#x27;s fleet had been captured or sunk. Both consuls then landed in Africa to quickly regroup and then sailed to Cape Bon, where they landed near Aspis. Here, they surrounded the city and set up a garrison. Then the consuls sent the troops to plunder the area, which was very plentiful. They herded cattle, burned houses of the rich, captured slaves, and destroyed the city&#x27;s defenses. In the meantime, the Senate instructed one consul to come back to Rome with the navy and the other to stay with the army in Africa. Manlius ended up returning with most of the fleet and prisoners.

During his second term in 250 BC, with Gaius Atilius Regulus, Lucius faced some tough times. In the previous years, Rome had many unsuccessful military ventures. After losing 150 ships during a storm in open sea, they had almost entirely withdrawn from naval warfare. Now, limited to combat by foot, the Romans received news of losing over half of their troops in Africa after an elephant stampede. This created a great fear of elephants and the Romans would not come within 3/4 of a mile of them. After these events, the army had a general lack of spirit, which Lucius’ second term would help to raise. With Gaius Atilius, he built 50 ships, and had a huge campaign to collect sailors and organize a fleet. In the meantime, Hasdrubal, the Carthaginian, brought his troops from Lilybaeum and set up camp near Panormus in June 250 BC, where Caecilius’ army got the Carthaginians’ elephants to stampede their own army, leading to improved morale and confidence among the army. With this, the consuls were encouraged to finish the war. They sailed to Sicily with about 120 ships in the fleet. They stopped and anchored off Lilybaeum, and besieged the city. The Romans thought that if they controlled this port it would be easy to manipulate the war. The Carthaginians also understood the obvious importance of this port and put their whole force together to save the city. The Carthaginians had a force of about 10,000 mercenaries (Celts and Greeks) to protect the people from the Romans.

The Romans lost to the Carthaginians&#x27; unexpected attacks. The Carthaginians sailed 50 ships from Africa under the command of Hannibal to try to save the city by charging towards the center of the harbor. The Romans did not attempt to stop the entry of the fleet because of their sudden appearance and unfavorable winds in a foreign port. Soon after, battles between the armies broke out and eventually the Carthaginians retreated and the Romans maintained their blockade. Later, the Carthaginians defeated the Romans for good when they set fire to the locations where the Romans had taken over. Even after the great losses that the Romans suffered at Lilybaeum, back in Rome, Lucius Manlius was quickly able to recruit about 10,000 sailors and sent them to Sicily, where they planned to attack Drepana, which was a port town about 24 miles north of Lilybaeum. The Roman attempt during the second consulship of Lucius Manlius Vulso ultimately failed, but it shows his leadership abilities through his capacity to keep recruiting sailors, even after a serious loss. With these abilities, he was able to help Rome stay on the path to winning the First Punic War.

==Death==
Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus died in 216 BC. Nothing is known about how he died. Since he died in 216 BC, this means that he lived for around 83 years, since one had to be around 40 years old to run for consul and the first time he ran was in 259 BC. It is probable that he died from natural causes, since he was around 83 years old, which was very old for someone living in Ancient Rome. Assuming this is correct, his birth would be somewhere around 300 BC.

==Analysis of contributions==
Throughout the years, Lucius Manlius has generally been accepted as yet another consul who helped in military victories. In the Battle of Cape Ecnomus, his command skills were essential in saving the transport ships, which allowed the Romans to pursue a follow-up attack at Aspis. In his second term, he brought the army into an improved and positive state of mind through building a new fleet and recruiting many sailors, even after the losses at Lilybaeum.

<doc id="465941" wikidata="Q1510231" url="?curid=465941" title="Betula nigra">
<text>Betula nigra, the black birch, river birch or water birch, is a species of birch native to the Eastern United States from New Hampshire west to southern Minnesota, and south to northern Florida and west to Texas. It is one of the few heat-tolerant birches in a family of mostly cold-weather trees which do not thrive in USDA Zone 6 and up. &quot;B. nigra&quot; commonly occurs in floodplains and swamps.

==Description==
&quot;Betula nigra&quot; is a deciduous tree growing to with a trunk in diameter. The base of the tree is often divided into multiple slender trunks.

Bark

Bark characteristics of the river birch differ during its youth stage, maturation, and old growth. The bark of a young river birch can vary from having a salmon-pink to brown-gray tint and can be described as having loose layers of curling, paper thin scales. As the tree matures, the salmon-pink color is exchanged for a reddish-brown with a dark grey base color. The scales on a mature tree lack the loose curling and are closely pressed into thick, irregular plates. These scales are slightly separated from the trunk and can shift outward to the side. Once the river birch ages past maturity, the scales become thicker towards the base of the trunk and are divided in deep furrows.

Leaves and fruit

The twigs are glabrous or thinly hairy. There is an absence of terminal buds, and lateral buds often have a hook at the tip of the bud, which differs from other species in the family Betulaceae. The leaves are alternate, ovate, long and broad, with a serrated margin and five to twelve pairs of veins. The upper surface of the leaf is dark green in color, while the underside can be described as having a light yellow-green color. The leaves turn yellow in Autumn. The flowers are wind-pollinated catkins long, the male catkins pendulous, the female catkins erect. The fruit is unusual among birches in maturing in late spring; it is composed of numerous tiny winged seeds packed between the catkin bracts.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Betula nigra&quot; is a tree that classified in the family Betulaceae, which is commonly known as the Birch or Alder Family. This family comprises six genera (&quot;Alnus, Betula, Carpinus, Corylus, Ostrya,&quot; and &quot;Ostryopsis)&quot; and includes alders, birches, hornbeams, and hazelnuts. Species within this family, along with &quot;Betula nigra&quot;, are shrubs or trees that grow along stream sides or in poorly drained soils throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Betulaceae is included within the order Fagales, which branches from the Rosid clade.

== Habitat and range ==
The river birch is often found in low-elevation regions from as north as Massachusetts to as south as northern Florida. It can be found extending west to Kansas and east to the coast where proper habitat conditions occur. As its name depicts, this birch is found along stream-sides. It can also be a prominent species found in forested wetland communities and in areas containing moist soil, such as floodplains. States include: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

River birch is best placed in USDA hardiness zones 4–9.

==Conservation status in the United States==
It is listed as threatened in New Hampshire.

== Ecology ==
In states in which mining is prevalent, the river birch is often used for reclamation and erosion control, as it is well suited for soils that are too acidic for other species of hardwoods. In West Virginia, they have been found to establish within mine refuse sites after being blown from neighboring areas.As the species occurs predominately in flood plains and along stream banks, it is described as being moderately tolerant of flooding. Saplings were observed to survive up to 30 days of continuous flooding in some regions. While the species is tolerant of excessive water, it is intolerant of shade. Seeds will not germinate without a large amount of direct sunlight.

This species is utilized by many local bird species, such as waterfowl, ruffed grouse, and wild turkey. Many waterfowl use the cover for nesting sites, while the ruffed grouse and wild turkey use the seeds as a food source. Deer have been known to graze on saplings or reachable branches. It is a larval host for over fifteen moth species, including &quot;Acronicta betulae&quot;, &quot;Acrobasis betulivorella&quot;, &quot;Bucculatrix coronatella&quot;, &quot;Nemoria bistriaria&quot;, &quot;Nites betulella&quot;, &quot;Orgyia leucostigma&quot;, and &quot;Pseudotelphusa betulella&quot;.

== Germination ==
Seeds are typically produced annually. Seasonal development begins in the fall as male catkins begin to form and mature. The emergence of female catkins corresponds with the return of leaves around early spring. Male and female fruit matures during the spring season or in the early summer months.

Once mature, the seeds are predominantly spread by wind or water from neighboring stream channels. Seeds spread by water are generally more successful as the moist banks of stream channels, where the seeds are deposited, are favorable for germination and sturdy establishment. Successful germination often occurs in large numbers along sandbars, where alluvial soil is present.

== Cultivation and uses ==
While its native habitat is wet ground, it will grow on higher land, and its bark is quite distinctive, making it a favored ornamental tree for landscape use. A number of cultivars with much whiter bark than the normal wild type have been selected for garden planting, including &#x27;Heritage&#x27; and &#x27;Dura Heat&#x27;; these are notable as the only white-barked birches resistant to the bronze birch borer (&quot;Agrilus anxius&quot;) in warm areas of the southeastern United States of America.Native Americans used the boiled sap as a sweetener similar to maple syrup, and the inner bark as a survival food. The river birch is not typically used in the commercial lumber industry, due to knotting, but its strong, closely grained wood is sometimes used for local furniture, woodenware, and fuel.
== Essential oils ==
The essential oils derived from leaves, inner bark, and buds of &quot;B. nigra&quot; are mostly composed of eugenol, linalool, palmitic acid, and heptacosane with many more compounds in smaller concentrations. The combined essential oils are phytotoxic to lettuce (&quot;Lactuca sativa&quot;) and perennial ryegrass (&quot;Lolium perenne&quot;) seedlings. They have also demonstrated insecticidal, nematicidal, and antibacterial properties.

<text>The Conservatoire de Paris (), or the Paris Conservatory, is a college of music and dance founded in 1795. Officially known as the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris (; CNSMDP), it is situated in the avenue Jean Jaurès in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, France. The Conservatoire offers instruction in music and dance, drawing on the traditions of the &#x27;French School&#x27;.

Formerly the conservatory also included drama, but in 1946 that division was moved into a separate school, the Conservatoire National Supérieur d&#x27;Art Dramatique (CNSAD), for acting, theatre and drama. Today the conservatories operate under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture and Communication and are associate members of PSL University. The CNSMDP is also associated with the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Lyon (CNSMDL).

== History ==
=== École Royale de Chant ===
On 3 December 1783 Papillon de la Ferté, &quot;intendant&quot; of the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi, proposed that Niccolò Piccinni should be appointed director of a future École Royale de Chant (Royal School of Singing). The school was instituted by a decree of 3 January 1784 and opened on 1 April with the composer François-Joseph Gossec as the provisional director. Piccinni refused the directorship, but did join the faculty as a professor of singing. The new school was located in buildings adjacent to the Hôtel des Menus-Plaisirs at the junction of the rue Bergère and the rue du Faubourg Poissonnière. In June, a class in dramatic declamation was added, and the name was modified to École Royale de Chant et de Déclamation.

=== Institut National de Musique ===
In 1792, Bernard Sarrette created the École Gratuite de la Garde Nationale, which in the following year became the Institut National de Musique. The latter was also installed in the facilities of the former Menus-Plaisirs on the rue Bergère and was responsible for the training of musicians for the National Guard bands, which were in great demand for the enormous, popular outdoor gatherings put on by the revolutionary government after the Reign of Terror.

=== Merger ===
On 3 August 1795, the government combined the École Royale with the Institut National de Musique, creating the Conservatoire de Musique under the direction of Sarrette. The combined organization remained in the facilities on the rue Bergère. The first 351 pupils commenced their studies in October 1796.

By 1800, the staff of the Conservatory included some of the most important names in music in Paris, including, besides Gossec, the composers Luigi Cherubini, Jean-François Le Sueur, Étienne Méhul, and Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny, as well as the violinists Pierre Baillot, Rodolphe Kreutzer, and Pierre Rode.

=== Bourbon restoration ===
Sarrette was dismissed on 28 December 1814, after the Bourbon Restoration, but was reinstated on 26 May 1815, after Napoleon&#x27;s return to power during the Hundred Days. After his fall, Sarrette was compelled to retire on 17 November. The school was closed in the first two years of the Bourbon Restoration, during the reign of Louis XVIII, but reopened in April 1816 as the École Royale de Musique, with François-Louis Perne as its director. In 1819, François Benoist was appointed professor of organ.

Probably the best known director in the 19th century was Luigi Cherubini, who took over on 1 April 1822 and remained in charge until 8 February 1842. Cherubini maintained high standards and his staff included teachers such as François-Joseph Fétis, Habeneck, Fromental Halévy, Le Sueur, Ferdinando Paer, and Anton Reicha.

Cherubini was succeeded by Daniel-François-Esprit Auber in 1842. Under Auber, composition teachers included Adolphe Adam, Halévy, and Ambroise Thomas; piano teachers, Louise Farrenc, Henri Herz, and Antoine François Marmontel; violin teachers, Jean-Delphin Alard and Charles Dancla; and cello teachers, Pierre Chevillard and Auguste Franchomme.

In 1852, Camille Urso, who studied with Lambert Massart, became the first female student to win a prize on violin.

=== Franco-Prussian War and the Third Republic ===
In the Franco-Prussian War, during the siege of Paris (September 1870 – January 1871), the Conservatory was used as a hospital. On 13 May 1871, the day after Auber&#x27;s death, the leaders of the Paris Commune appointed Francisco Salvador-Daniel as the director. Daniel was shot to death ten days later by troops of the French Army. He was replaced by Ambroise Thomas, who remained in the post until 1896. Thomas&#x27;s rather conservative directorship was vigorously criticized by many of the students, including Claude Debussy.

During this period César Franck was ostensibly the organ teacher, but was actually giving classes in composition. His classes were attended by several students who were later to become important composers, including Ernest Chausson, Guy Ropartz, Guillaume Lekeu, Charles Bordes, and Vincent d&#x27;Indy.

Théodore Dubois succeeded Thomas after the latter&#x27;s death in 1896. Professors included Charles-Marie Widor, Gabriel Fauré, and Charles Lenepveu for composition, Alexandre Guilmant for organ, Paul Taffanel for flute, and Louis Diémer for piano.

Lenepveu had been expected to succeed Dubois as director, but after the &quot;Affaire Ravel&quot; in 1905, Ravel&#x27;s teacher Gabriel Fauré became director. &quot;Le Courrier Musical&quot; (15 June 1905) wrote: &quot;Gabriel Fauré is an independent thinker: that is to say, there is much we can expect from him, and it is with joy that we welcome his nomination.&quot;

Fauré appointed forward-thinking representatives (such as Debussy, Paul Dukas, and André Messager) to the governing council, loosened restrictions on repertoire, and added conducting and music history to the courses of study. Widor&#x27;s composition students during this period included Darius Milhaud, Arthur Honegger, and Germaine Tailleferre. Other students included Lili Boulanger and Nadia Boulanger. New to the staff were Alfred Cortot for piano and Eugène Gigout for organ.

=== Rue de Madrid ===
In 1911 the Conservatory moved to 14 rue de Madrid, into facilities that were formerly the of the of the Jesuits, whose building had been purchased by the French state in 1905.

Henri Rabaud succeeded Fauré in 1920 and served until April 1941. Notable students were Olivier Messiaen, Jean Langlais, and Jehan Alain. Staff included Dukas and Jean Roger-Ducasse for composition, Marcel Dupré for organ, Marcel Moyse for flute, and Claire Croiza for singing.

Like all institutions in Paris, the Conservatoire was ruled by Nazi Germany and the collaborationist Vichy government during the Occupation of France of 1940–1944. Under the regime&#x27;s antisemitic policies, Conservatoire administrators alternated between actively collaborating to purge the school of Jewish students (in the case of Rabaud) or working to conceal and protect Jewish students and faculty (in the case of Rabaud&#x27;s successor, Claude Delvincourt).

Delvincourt was director from 1941 until his death in an automobile accident in 1954. Delvincourt was a progressive administrator, adding classes in harpsichord, saxophone, percussion, and the Ondes Martenot. Staff included Milhaud for composition and Messiaen for analysis and aesthetics.

In 1946, the dramatic arts were transferred to a separate institution, the Conservatoire National Supérieur d&#x27;Art Dramatique (CNSAD). Music and dance became the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris (CNSMDP).

Delvincourt was succeeded by Dupré in 1954, Raymond Loucheur in 1956, Raymond Gallois-Montbrun in 1962, Marc Bleuse in 1984, and Alain Louvier in 1986. Plans to move CNSMDP to more modern facilities in the Parc de la Villette were initiated under Bleuse and completed under Louvier.

==== Traditions for flute ====

The tradition of the final or exit examination, the &quot;concours&quot;, has required students, at the end of their course of study, to perform in public a prepared set of musical pieces for a jury consisting of the professors and internationally renowned professionals on the particular instrument, the composer of the solo de concours, and the Director. Behind closed doors, the candidates would be given additional tasks to perform such as sight-reading. In the 20th century, the candidates were judged against a standard, and those who demonstrated outstanding mastery and artistry receive the &quot;Premier Prix&quot;, the equivalent of a diploma with high honor. Those who earned &quot;Deuxieme Prix,&quot; also received a diploma but could elect to remain to try again a year later for the top prize. Two lesser levels of distinction existed, the &quot;Premier Accessit&quot; and &quot;Deuxieme Accessit&quot;, equivalent to Honorable Mentions but without a diploma. Historically, students who failed to pass the exam on the first attempt would return for another one to two years additional study and try a second time. A student failing to earn either level diploma after two additional attempts would be terminated from the program.

=== Cité de la Musique ===
CNSMDP moved to its new facilities in the Cité de la Musique in September 1990.

After over two centuries of male directors, Émilie Delorme, for a decade director of the European Academy of Music () at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, was appointed as the Conservatoire&#x27;s first woman director on 14 December 2019. Currently, the conservatories train more than 1,200 students in structured programs, with 350 professors in nine departments.

== Facilities ==

=== Former concert hall on the rue Bergère ===
A concert hall, designed by the architect , was inaugurated on 7 July 1811. It is in the shape of a U (with the orchestra at the straight end). It holds an audience of 1055. The French composer and conductor Antoine Elwart described it as the Stradivarius of concert halls.

In 1828 François Habeneck, a professor of violin and head of the conservatory&#x27;s orchestra, founded the Société des Concerts du Conservatoire (forerunner of the Orchestre de Paris). The society held concerts in the hall almost continuously until 1945, when it moved to the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. The French composer Hector Berlioz premiered his &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot; in the conservatory&#x27;s hall on 5 December 1830 with an orchestra of more than a hundred players.

The concert hall is now part of CNSAD.


=== Library ===
The original library was created by Sarrette in 1801. After the construction of the concert hall, the library moved to a large room above the entrance vestibule. In the 1830s, Berlioz became a part-time curator in the library and was the librarian from 1852 until his death in 1869, when he was succeeded by Félicien David.

=== Instrument museum ===
The Conservatory Instrument Museum, founded in 1861, was formed from the instrument collection of Louis Clapisson. The French music historian Gustave Chouquet became the curator of the museum in 1871 and did much to expand and upgrade the collection. The collection is now located in the Musée de la Musique.

== Successor institutions ==

=== CNSAD ===
The dramatics arts were separated from music and dance in 1946 and are now in the Conservatoire National Supérieur d&#x27;Art Dramatique (CNSAD) (National Superior Conservatory of the Dramatic Arts), a school for acting, drama. It is located in the original historic building of the Conservatoire de Paris on the rue du Conservatoire at rue Sainte-Cécile in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. Free public performances by students at the CNSAD are given frequently in the Conservatory of Music&#x27;s former theatre.

=== CNSMDP ===
The music and dance divisions of the Conservatoire de Paris are now officially known as the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris (CNSMDP) (National Superior Conservatory of Paris for Music and Dance). The French government built its new campus in the 19th arrondissement of Paris as part of the Cité de la Musique, designed by Christian de Portzamparc. The new facilities were inaugurated in 1990.

The organ on site was built in 1991 by the Austrian Rieger Orgelbau firm. It has 53 stops on 3 manuals and pedals. A larger organ of over 7,000 pipes with 91 stops was made in 2015 by the same company for the symphony hall of the nearby Philharmonie de Paris.

<text>Zhumadian (; postal: Chumatien) is a prefecture-level city in southern Henan province, China. It borders Xinyang to the south, Nanyang to the west, Pingdingshan to the northwest, Luohe to the north, Zhoukou to the northeast, and the province of Anhui to the east.

As of the 2020 Chinese census, its total population was 7,008,427 inhabitants whom 1,466,913 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of Yicheng District and Suiping County now conurbated.

It was once the center of the Cai state during the Eastern Zhou era. The state leaves its name in several of the subdivisions including Shangcai County and Xincai County.

== Administrative divisions ==
The prefecture-level city of Zhumadian administers 1 district and 9 counties.

*Yicheng District ()
*Runan County ()
*Pingyu County ()
*Xincai County ()
*Shangcai County ()
*Xiping County ()
*Suiping County ()
*Queshan County ()
*Zhengyang County ()
*Biyang County ()

== Geography ==
Zhumadian is situated at 32° 18&#x27;−33° 35&#x27; N latitude, and 113° 10&#x27;−115° 12&#x27; E longitude, with a maximum east–west width of , and at most long from south to north. The area of the prefecture is , occupying 8.9% of the total provincial area. Neighbouring prefectures are:

*Fuyang, Anhui (E)
*Xinyang (S)
*Nanyang (W)
*Pingdingshan (NW)
*Luohe (N)
*Zhoukou (NE)

The terrain is dominated by mountains, hills, hillocks, and plains.

=== Climate ===
Zhumadian has a four-season, monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;), with cold, somewhat damp, winters, and hot, humid summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, while the annual mean is . More than 60% of the annual precipitation of occurs from June to September. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 39% in March to 46% in four months, the city receives 1,927 hours of bright sunshine annually.

== Agriculture ==
Mainly wheat, maize, peanut, sesame, green beans and tobacco are grown.

== Culture ==
Zhumadian has a rich cultural history and the birthplace of many great people in ancient times. There is an old site of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai who are the characters in &quot;the Butterfly Lovers&quot;, a famous Chinese story.

Zhumadian is the location of Mount Chaya, a major geological site of interest and tourist attraction.

People from Henan have been negatively stereotyped, with Zhumadian being singled out as the supposed base of scamming. This may have originated from the aftermath of the 1975 Banqiao Dam collapse, when locals affected by the disaster eventually become the first large batch of migrant workers to go to Guangdong. Most of these workers had little education and lived together in impoverished communities, leading to a negative perception of Zhumadian people. A popular quote going around was:

== Dams ==
Zhumadian has 62 different dams including Banqiao Dam within its territory. The failure of the Banqiao and Shimantan Dams in 1975, which caused more than 150,000 casualties and made more than 10 million people homeless, is considered the biggest catastrophe of its kind.

== Transportation ==
One of the Chinese main highways, China National Highway 107, runs through Zhumadian. Zhumadian also has its own transportation system. The old Golden Decade-built Zhumadian Aerodrome primarily served military operations from 1931 until late-2018, when it was converted for commercial passenger airliner use as well.

<text>Greenleaf Whittier Pickard (February 14, 1877 – January 8, 1956) was an American electrical engineer and inventor. He was largely responsible and most famous for the development of the crystal detector, the earliest type of diode detector, although he was not the earliest discoverer of the rectifying properties of contact between certain solid materials. The crystal detector was the central component in many early radio receivers from around 1906 until about 1920. Pickard also experimented with antennas, radio wave propagation and noise suppression.

On August 30, 1906 he filed a patent for a silicon crystal detector, which was granted on November 20, 1906.

On June 10, 1907 he filed a patent for a &quot;Magnetic Aerial&quot; (a loop aerial) which was granted on January 21, 1908. Pickard&#x27;s loop antenna had directional properties that could be used to reduce interference to the intended wireless communications.

On June 21, 1911 he filed a patent on a crystal detector incorporating a springy low inertia wire of about 24 gauge formed with a loop or helix and pointed to make contact with the crystal. Crystal detectors incorporating this construction would become the most widely used and popularly known by the term &quot;cat whisker detector&quot;. This patent was granted on July 21, 1914.

Greenleaf Whittier Pickard was named after his great-uncle, the American Quaker John Greenleaf Whittier (1807-1892). He was the grandson of author and humorist Mathew Franklin Whittier. Pickard was president of the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1913.

<text>The online public access catalog (OPAC), now frequently synonymous with &quot;library catalog&quot;, is an online database of materials held by a library or group of libraries. Online catalogs have largely replaced the analog card catalogs previously used in libraries.

==History==

===Early online ===

Although a handful of experimental systems existed as early as the 1960s, the first large-scale online catalogs were developed at Ohio State University in 1975 and the Dallas Public Library in 1978.

These and other early online catalog systems tended to closely reflect the card catalogs that they were intended to replace. Using a dedicated terminal or telnet client, users could search a handful of pre-coordinate indexes and browse the resulting display in much the same way they had previously navigated the card catalog.

Throughout the 1980s, the number and sophistication of online catalogs grew. The first commercial systems appeared, and would by the end of the decade largely replace systems built by libraries themselves. Library catalogs began providing improved search mechanisms, including Boolean and keyword searching, as well as ancillary functions, such as the ability to place holds on items that had been checked-out.

At the same time, libraries began to develop applications to automate the purchase, cataloging, and circulation of books and other library materials. These applications, collectively known as an integrated library system (ILS) or library management system, included an online catalog as the public interface to the system&#x27;s inventory. Most library catalogs are closely tied to their underlying ILS system.

===Stagnation and dissatisfaction===
The 1990s saw a relative stagnation in the development of online catalogs. Although the earlier character-based interfaces were replaced with ones for the Web, both the design and the underlying search technology of most systems did not advance much beyond that developed in the late 1980s.

At the same time, organizations outside of libraries began developing more sophisticated information retrieval systems. Web search engines like Google and popular e-commerce websites such as Amazon.com provided simpler to use (yet more powerful) systems that could provide relevancy ranked search results using probabilistic and vector-based queries.

Prior to the widespread use of the Internet, the online catalog was often the first information retrieval system library users ever encountered. Now accustomed to web search engines, newer generations of library users have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the complex (and often arcane) search mechanisms of older online catalog systems.

This has, in turn, led to vocal criticisms of these systems within the library community itself, and in recent years to the development of newer (often termed &#x27;next-generation&#x27;) catalogs.

===Next-generation catalogs===
Newer generations of library catalog systems, typically called discovery systems (or a discovery layer), are distinguished from earlier OPACs by their use of more sophisticated search technologies, including relevancy ranking and faceted search, as well as features aimed at greater user interaction and participation with the system, including tagging and reviews. These new features rely heavily on existing metadata which may be poor or inconsistent, particularly for older records.

Newer catalog platforms may be independent of the organization&#x27;s integrated library system (ILS), instead providing drivers that allow for the synchronization of data between the two systems. While the original online catalog interfaces were almost exclusively built by ILS vendors, libraries have increasingly sought next-generation catalogs built by enterprise search companies and open-source software projects, often led by libraries themselves.

==Union catalogs==
Although library catalogs typically reflect the holdings of a single library, they can also contain the holdings of a group or consortium of libraries. These systems, known as union catalogs, are usually designed to aid the borrowing of books and other materials among the member institutions via interlibrary loan. Examples of this type of catalogs include COPAC, SUNCAT, NLA Trove, and WorldCat—the last catalogs the collections of libraries worldwide.

==Related systems==
There are a number of systems that share much in common with library catalogs, but have traditionally been distinguished from them. Libraries utilize these systems to search for items not traditionally covered by a library catalog, although these systems are sometimes integrated into a more comprehensive discovery system.

Bibliographic databases—such as Medline, ERIC, PsycINFO, and many others—index journal articles and other research data.

There are also a number of applications aimed at managing documents, photographs, and other digitized or born-digital items such as Digital Commons and DSpace. Particularly in academic libraries, these systems (often known as digital library systems or institutional repository systems) assist with efforts to preserve documents created by faculty and students.

Electronic resource management helps librarians to track selection, acquisition, and licensing of a library&#x27;s electronic information resources.

<text>Robert Jay Lifton (born May 16, 1926) is an American psychiatrist and author, chiefly known for his studies of the psychological causes and effects of wars and political violence, and for his theory of thought reform. He was an early proponent of the techniques of psychohistory.

==Biography==

Lifton was born in 1926, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of businessman Harold A. Lifton, and Ciel Lifton née Roth. In 1942, he enrolled at Cornell University at the age of 16. He was admitted to New York Medical College in 1944, graduating in 1948. He interned at the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn in 1948–49. He did his psychiatric residence training at the Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York in 1949–51.

From 1951 to 1953, Lifton served as an Air Force psychiatrist in Japan and Korea, to which he later attributed his interest in war and politics. He has since worked as a teacher and researcher at the Washington School of Psychiatry, Harvard University, and the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, where he helped to found the Center for the Study of Human Violence.

He married the children&#x27;s writer Betty Jean Kirschner in 1952, and they had two children. She died in Boston on November 19, 2010, from complications of pneumonia. Lifton has said that cartooning is his avocation; he has published two books of humorous cartoons about birds.

He is a member of Collegium International, an organization of leaders with political, scientific, and ethical expertise whose goal is to provide new approaches in overcoming the obstacles in the way of a peaceful, socially just and an economically sustainable world. In 2012, Lifton was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from The New School.

==Wellfleet Psychohistory Group==

During the 1960s, Lifton, together with his mentor Erik Erikson and historian Bruce Mazlish of MIT, formed a group to apply psychology and psychoanalysis to the study of history. Meetings were held at Lifton&#x27;s home in Wellfleet, Massachusetts. The Wellfleet Psychohistory Group, as it became known, focused mainly on psychological motivations for war, terrorism, and genocide in recent history. In 1965, they received sponsorship from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences to establish psychohistory as a separate field of study. A collection of research papers by the group was published in 1975: &quot;Explorations in Psychohistory: The Wellfleet Papers&quot; (see Bibliography; Lifton as editor). Lifton&#x27;s work in this field was deeply influenced by Erikson&#x27;s studies of Hitler and other political figures, as well as by Sigmund Freud&#x27;s concern with the mass social effects of deep-seated drives, particularly attitudes toward death.

Beginning in 1953, Lifton interviewed American servicemen who had been prisoners of war (POWs) during the Korean War, in addition to priests and students, or teachers who had been held in prison in China after 1951. In addition to interviews with 25 Americans and Europeans, Lifton interviewed 15 Chinese who had fled after having been subjected to indoctrination in Chinese universities.

Lifton&#x27;s 1961 book, &quot;Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of &quot;Brainwashing&quot; in China&quot;, based on this research, was a study of coercive techniques used in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He described this process as &quot;thought reform&quot; or &quot;brainwashing&quot;, though he preferred the former term. The term &quot;thought-terminating cliché&quot; was popularized in this book. Lifton found that after the POWs returned to the United States, their thinking soon returned to normal, contrary to the popular image of &quot;brainwashing&quot; as resulting in permanent changes. A 1989 reprint edition was published by University of North Carolina Press.

==Studies of war and atrocity survivors==

Several of his books featured mental adaptations that people made in extreme wartime environments: &quot;Death in Life: Survivors of Hiroshima&quot; (1967), &quot;Home from the War: Vietnam Veterans—Neither Victims nor Executioners&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide&quot; (1986). Regarding Hiroshima and Vietnam survivors or Nazi perpetrators, Lifton believed that the psychic fragmentation suffered by his subjects was an extreme form of the pathologies that arise in peacetime life due to the pressures and fears of modern society.

His studies of the behavior of people who had committed war crimes, both individually and in groups, concluded that while human nature is not innately cruel and only rare sociopaths can participate in atrocities without suffering lasting emotional harm, such crimes do not require any unusual degree of personal evil or mental illness. He says that they are nearly sure to happen given certain conditions (either accidental or deliberately arranged), which Lifton called &quot;atrocity-producing situations&quot;. &quot;The Nazi Doctors&quot; was the first in-depth study of how medical professionals rationalized their participation in the Holocaust, from the early stages of the T-4 Euthanasia Program to the extermination camps.

In the Hiroshima and Vietnam studies, Lifton also concluded that the sense of personal disintegration that many people experienced after witnessing death and destruction on a mass scale could ultimately lead to a new emotional resilience—but that without the proper support and counseling, most survivors would remain trapped in feelings of unreality and guilt. In her 2005 autobiography &quot;My Life So Far&quot;, Jane Fonda described Lifton&#x27;s work with Vietnam veterans, along with that of fellow psychiatrists Leonard Neff, Chaim Shatan, and Sarah Haley, as &quot;tireless and empathetic&quot;.

In 1975, the BBC adapted Lifton&#x27;s book &quot;Death in Life&quot; as Episode 31 in Season 11 of their program Horizon.  The documentary, &quot;To Die, To Live, The Survivors of Hiroshima&quot;, was written and directed by Robert Vas, and edited by Peter Goodchild. The program aired on August 6, 1975.  In a &quot;New York Times&quot; review, John Leonard wrote, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to watch a whole hour of it. I got the point. I was suspicious of the cultivated European voices translating the words of the survivors. I resented the ominous music, the pregnant pauses, the mechanical alternations of scenes of modern Hiroshima in livid, living color with the black‐and-white disaster footage of 1945 newsreels. Where was the center of this irony and at whose expense? I disliked the manipulation of my emotions by crude juxtaposings of disfigured women and department store mannequins with American wigs, of missing ears and honky‐tonk acts, of a river of corpses and night baseball. I thought the subtleties of Dr. Lifton&#x27;s book were obscured by a piling‐on of images intended, and guaranteed, to shock. Mutilated bodies look the same, don&#x27;t they, at death camps and at Dresden and at train wrecks? What, in this wretched century, is so special about Hiroshima?&quot;

Lifton was one of the first organizers of therapeutic discussion groups on this subject in which mental health practitioners met with veterans face-to-face. He and Dr. Neff successfully lobbied for the inclusion of post-traumatic stress disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). His book on Hiroshima survivors won the 1969 National Book Award in Science.
==Theories of totalism and the protean self==

&quot;Totalism&quot;, a word which he first used in &quot;Thought Reform&quot;, is Lifton&#x27;s term for the characteristics of ideological movements and organizations that desire total control over human behavior and thought. Lifton&#x27;s usage differs from theories of totalitarianism, as it can be applied to the ideology of groups that do not wield governmental power.

In Lifton&#x27;s opinion, though such attempts always fail, they follow a common pattern and cause predictable types of psychological damage in individuals and societies. He finds two common motives in totalistic movements: the fear and denial of death, channeled into violence against scapegoat groups that are set up to represent a metaphorical threat to survival, and a reactionary fear of social change.

In his later work, Lifton has focused on defining the type of change to which totalism is opposed, for which he coined the term &quot;the protean self&quot;. In the book of the same title, he states that the development of a &quot;fluid and many-sided personality&quot; is a positive trend in modern societies. He said that mental health now requires &quot;continuous exploration and personal experiment&quot;, which requires the growth of a purely relativist society that is willing to discard and diminish previously established cultures and traditions.

==Critiques of modern war and terrorism==

Following his work with Hiroshima survivors, Lifton became a vocal opponent of nuclear weapons, arguing that nuclear strategy and warfighting doctrine made even mass genocide banal and conceivable. While not a strict pacifist, he has spoken against U.S. military actions in his lifetime, particularly the Vietnam War and Iraq War, believing that they arose from irrational and aggressive aspects of American politics motivated by fear.

In 1993, he said:
What&#x27;s happening there [in Bosnia] merits the use of the word genocide. There is an effort to systematically destroy an entire group. It&#x27;s even been conceptualized by Serbian nationalists as so-called &quot;ethnic cleansing.&quot; That term signifies mass killing, mass relocation, and that does constitute genocide.Lifton regards terrorism as an increasingly serious threat due to the proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons and totalist ideologies. He has, however, criticized the Bush administration&#x27;s &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; as a misguided and dangerous attempt to &quot;destroy all vulnerability&quot;. His 1999 book, &quot;Destroying the World to Save It,&quot; described the apocalyptic terrorist sect Aum Shinrikyo as a forerunner of &quot;the new global terrorism&quot;.

===Appearances===
Lifton is featured in the 2003 documentary &quot;Flight From Death&quot;, a film that investigates the relationship of human violence to fear of death, as related to subconscious influences. In 2006, Lifton appeared in a documentary on cults on the History Channel, &quot;Decoding the Past&quot;, along with fellow psychiatrist Peter A. Olsson. On May 18, 2008, Lifton delivered the commencement address at Stonehill College and discussed the apparent &quot;Superpower Syndrome&quot; experienced by the United States in the modern era.
In 2018 he also appears in the documentary Metamorphosis, about climate change and positive changes towards a more sustainable future.

<doc id="465955" wikidata="Q211243" url="?curid=465955" title="Yinchuan">
<text>Yinchuan is the capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China, and was the capital of the Tangut-led Western Xia dynasty. It has an area of and a total population of 2,859,074 according to the 2020 Chinese census, and its built-up area was home to 2,564,918 inhabitants spread between three urban districts and Helan and Yongning counties largely being urbanized. The city&#x27;s name literally means &quot;silver river&quot;.

Yinchuan is now the permanent site for the China-Arab Expo, a platform for cultural and economic exchanges between China and Arab countries.

The city is also home to Ningxia University, the largest regional comprehensive university under Ningxia&#x27;s Project 211.

==History==

The area that is now Yinchuan was home to Shuidonggou, China&#x27;s earliest paleolithic site. It dates from over 30,000 years ago, Later in Chinese prehistory, rock art was created in the Helan mountains adjacent to modern-day Yinchuan.

Yinchuan was originally a county under the name of &quot;Fuping&quot; in the 1st century BCE; its name was changed to &quot;Huaiyuan&quot; in the 6th century CE.

=== Western Xia and Mongol Conquest ===
After the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907, Yinchuan came under the control of the Tanguts. In 1038, the Tangut leader Yuanhao declared himself emperor of the Great Xia and made Yinchuan his capital, at that time known as &quot;Xingqing&quot; (). This provoked much of the native Han population to emigrate. Several of Yinchuan&#x27;s important cultural sites were built under the Western Xia, such as the Pagoda of Chengtian and the Western Xia mausoleums.

In the autumn of 1209, the Mongols invaded Western Xia. They laid siege to Yinchuan, which by this point was known as &quot;Zhongxing&quot;. The garrison of 150,000 managed to hold out against the Mongols, although Western Xia submitted to Mongol suzerainty regardless. After Xia attempted to reassert its independence, in 1227 the Mongols returned and slaughtered the city&#x27;s entire population. Genghis Khan died during the siege under debated circumstances. The Mongols knew the city as &quot;Iryai&quot;.

=== Ming and Qing dynasties ===
Under the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties, it was a prefecture of Ningxia. During the Dungan revolt, Dungan forces massacred 100,000 people in Yinchuan.

In 1739, the city was heavily affected by the Yinchuan–Pingluo earthquake. A maximum intensity of XII was determined on the Chinese seismic intensity scale, and XI on the Mercalli intensity scale. The earthquake collapsed most houses, temples, offices, and a city wall tall and wide. Ground fissures up to an meter wide, and long, and great subsidence were accounted in historical records. Over 15,300 people killed and the city was completely levelled. Blazing fires burned all the way through the night as many canals were destroyed, shutting off the flow of water. The ground opened for more than , where sand and black water erupted. Aftershocks persisted for more than two years with the largest being a 5.5 on February 13 that same year.

=== 20th century ===
In 1928, when the province of Ningxia was formed from part of Gansu, Yinchuan became the capital city. In 1954, when Ningxia province was abolished, the city was put in Gansu province; but, with the establishment of the Ningxia Hui autonomous region in 1958, Yinchuan once again became the capital.

Traditionally, Yinchuan was an administrative and commercial center. In the 1950s, the city had many commercial enterprises, and there were some handicrafts, but no modern industry. The city has since grown considerably. Extensive coal deposits discovered on the eastern bank of the Yellow River, near Shizuishan, to the north, have made Shizuishan a coal-mining center.

Yinchuan, however, remains largely non-industrial. The immediate plains area, intensively irrigated by a system developed as long ago as the Han (206 BC–AD 220) and Tang (618–907) dynasties, is extremely productive. Yinchuan is the chief agricultural market and distribution center for this area and also deals in animal products from the herds tended by nomads in the surrounding grasslands. It is a market for grain and has flour mills, as well as rice-hulling and oil-extraction plants. The wool produced in the surrounding plains supplies a woolen-textile mill.

During the nationwide 1989 Protests that followed the death of Hu Yaobang, Yinchuan was the site of student demonstrations responding to the April 26 Editorial. On May 28, numbers dropped drastically when only 3,000 students took to the streets. A similar number of people would march again, this time with wreaths and banners, when they heard the news about the June 4 crackdown in Beijing.

On July 23, 1993, China Northwest Airlines Flight 2119, in route from Yinchuan Xihuayuan Airport to Beijing Capital International Airport, crashed into a lake after it was unable to get airborne while attempting to take off at Yinchuan Airport, killing 54 passengers and 1 crew member on board.

=== 21st century ===
On 21 June 2023, a gas explosion inside of a barbecue restaurant in Yinchuan killed at least 31 people and injured 7 others.

==Geography==

Yinchuan lies in the middle of the Yinchuan Plain. It is sheltered from the deserts of Mongolia by the high ranges of the Helan Mountains to its west. The Yellow River runs through Yinchuan from southwest to northeast. The average elevation of Yinchuan is 1,100 meters (about 3,608 feet). The urban center of Yinchuan lies about halfway between the Yellow River and the edge of Helan Mountains.

===Climate===
Yinchuan has a cold desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;) with an annual rainfall of . Yinchuan has distinct seasons, with dry, cold winters, late springs and short hot summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, with the annual mean at . Diurnal temperature variation tends to be large due to the aridity, which also partly contributes to the sunny climate; with monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 58 percent in January to 67 percent in November, the city receives 2,761 hours of bright sunshine annually. There are 158 frost-free days.
==Administrative divisions==
==Demographics==

=== Ethnic groups ===
As of 2019, 72.43% of the city&#x27;s population is Han Chinese, 25.79% is Hui, and 1.78% are other ethnic minorities. Of the city&#x27;s six county-level divisions, all have a super-majority of Han Chinese people sans the county-level city of Lingwu, which is majority Hui.

=== Urbanization ===
Of the city&#x27;s population, 79.05% live in urban areas as of 2019. This proportion is highest in Xixia District, where 91.28% of the population lives in urban areas, and is lowest in Lingwu, where 58.22% of the population lives in urban areas.

==Economy==
The city&#x27;s gross domestic product per capita was ¥31,436 (US$4,526) in 2008, ranking 197th of 659 Chinese cities. In 2010, Yinchuan was designated as the site for the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum. At the national level, Yinchuan hosts various events such as the China-Arab States Expo, to function as a commercial link between China and Arab States. Yinchuan has an aircraft tire plant owned by Singapore-based Giti Tire.

Yinchuan classifies itself as a &#x27;smart city&#x27;, where modern technology is employed such as facial recognition for public transport payments, connected trash bins and digital citizen service centres.

==Transportation==
Until the 1950s, the Yellow river, which is navigable downstream as far as Baotou in the Inner Mongolian autonomous region and upstream to Zhongwei and Zhongning, was the chief communication link. Yinchuan still has a river port at Hengcheng, about to the east.

=== Rail transport ===
Since 1958, the city has been served by Yinchuan railway station on the Baotou–Lanzhou railway integrating it in the Chinese railway network. The Taiyuan–Zhongwei–Yinchuan railway opened in 2011. Since the opening of the Yinchuan–Zhongwei high-speed railway in 2019, Yinchuan is also served by high-speed train services.

Yinchuan is the first Chinese city to implement a monorail beyond demonstrational use, transporting visitors around the Yinchuan International Flower Expo park. The BYD Skytrain based system entered operation in September 2017.

=== Road transport ===
Highways link the city to Baotou along the river, to Lanzhou in Gansu province to the southwest, to Wuwei in Gansu to the west, and to Xi&#x27;an in Shaanxi province to the southeast.

*China National Highway 110, 109, 211 and 244
*G69 Yinchuan–Baise Expressway
*G85 Yinchuan–Kunming Expressway
*G1816 Wuhai–Maqên Expressway
*G2004 Yinchuan Ring Expressway

In Q1 2018, Yinchuan ranked first in traffic congestion severity in China. According to research by AutoNavi, and the Planning and Research Institute of the Ministry of Transport, this was caused by numerous construction works and the poor structure of the road network, rather than pure traffic volume. After reorganization of the road network and bottleneck intersections, congestion has reduced.

=== Air transport ===
It is served by Yinchuan Hedong International Airport. It is from Yinchuan and has flights to Beijing, Chengdu, Dunhuang, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Xian, and Zhengzhou.

== Culture ==
Although most residents are Han Chinese, Yinchuan is a center for the Muslim Hui people, who constitute slightly over a quarter of the population. Hui Muslims play a vital role as being middlemen in trade between the Middle East and China, and the China-Middle East trade has become increasingly important to the country. Consequently, the national government has started constructing a $3.7 billion Islamic theme park called &quot;World Muslim City&quot; in Yinchuan. Unlike Uyghurs, who faces far more restrictions in religious freedoms, Hui Muslims generally do not seek independence from China and have a cultural affinity to the Han, and are far more assimilated into mainstream Chinese life.

A number of cultural festivals are celebrated in Yinchuan. These include an Internet Film Festival, a Car and Motorcycle Tourism Festival, and an International Poetry Festival. Until 2000, Yinchuan was also the traditional host of an August festival celebrating the harvesting of Goji berries (a major product of Ningxia).

==Tourism==


The city&#x27;s attractions include the Sand-lake, the Western Xia tombs, and the China Western film Studios.

Sand Lake is a lake in a desert 35 miles north of Yinchuan with birds, reeds, lotus and fish.

The Western Xia Imperial Tombs are 15.5 miles west of Yinchuan on east side of Mt. Helan. Since June 1972, nine imperial tombs and 253 lesser tombs have been unearthed, which are as grand as Ming Tombs in Beijing. With a total area of more than 19.3 square miles, it is unique among royal burials.

China West Film Studio, which has been famed as &#x27;One Superb in China, and Treasure of Ningxia Province&#x27;, is at the eastern foot of the magnificent Helanshan Mountain, 25 kilometers from the railway station of Yinchuan City, and 48 kilometers from Hedong Airport. It produced The Herdsman, Red Sorghum, Lover&#x27;s Grief over the Yellow River, New Dragon Gate Inn, Ashes of Time, A Chinese Odyssey, Qiao&#x27;s Grand Courtyard (TV series) and nearly one hundred other films. In 2018, John Cena lived for five months in Yinchuan while working on a film, &quot;Project X-Traction&quot;, with Jackie Chan (the movie was never ultimately released).

There are two pagodas in Yinchuan that are part of the &#x27;Eight Famous Scenery of Ningxia&#x27;: one is the Haibao Pagoda in the northern suburb and the other is the Chengtiansi Pagoda in the west.

Parts of the Great Wall are near the city.

<text>Rabobank (; full name: &quot;Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A.&quot;) is a Dutch multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in Utrecht, Netherlands. The group comprises 89 local Dutch Rabobanks (2019), a central organisation (Rabobank Nederland), and many specialised international offices and subsidiaries. Food and agribusiness constitute the primary international focus of the Rabobank Group. Rabobank is the second-largest bank in the Netherlands in terms of total assets.

In terms of Tier 1 capital, the organisation is among the 50 largest financial institutions in the world. As of 2022, total assets amount to €628 billion with a net profit of €2.7 billion.

Rabobank has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

==History==
Rooted in agriculture, Rabobank is set up as a federation of local credit unions that offer services to the local markets.

=== Creation of farmers&#x27; banks ===
The bank was rooted in the ideas of Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen, the founder of the cooperative movement of credit unions, who in 1864 created the first farmers&#x27; bank in Germany. Being a countryside mayor he was confronted with the abject poverty of the farmers and their families. He tried to alleviate this need through charitable aid, but realised that self-reliance had more potential in the long run, and thus converted his charitable foundation into a farmers&#x27; bank in 1864. In doing so he created the &quot;Darlehnskassen-Verein&quot;, which collected the savings of countryside dwellers and provided enterprising farmers with loans.

This model found a lot of interest in the Netherlands at the end of the 19th century. One of the first of Raiffeisen&#x27;s followers was Father Gerlacus van den Elsen, who stood at the basis of a number of local farmers&#x27; banks in the south of the Netherlands. The model caught on being championed by the clergy and the countryside elites. The mission of the farmers&#x27; lending banks was an idealistic one, but they always operated using strict business principles. Controversially, a founding principle of Rabobank&#x27;s cooperative style was to cooperate in the interest of &quot;warding off the Shylock&quot; . The cooperative bank model assured a tight bond between invested capital and the community.
=== Early cooperation ===
The bank&#x27;s traditional headquarters are Utrecht and Eindhoven. In 1898, two cooperative bank conglomerates were formed:
* Coöperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Bank in Utrecht
* Coöperatieve Centrale Boerenleenbank in Eindhoven

Raiffeisen-Bank was formed as a cooperative of six local banks, while Boerenleenbank was a cooperative of 22 local banks. These two existed side by side for three-quarters of a century despite their obvious similarities. The reasons for this owed in part to legal disagreements. The most important difference, however, was cultural. The Eindhoven-based Boerenleenbank had a decidedly Catholic signature while the Raiffeisen-Bank had a Protestant background. In the past the Netherlands underwent a process of pillarisation (Dutch: &quot;verzuiling&quot;), which in practice meant that members of different religious congregations and political movements essentially lived side by side, without contact between the two. A consequence of this pillarisation was that many villages hosted not one but two local banks, one each for Catholics and Protestants. The close-knit community banking that resulted helped these banks to better control their risks. Consequently, when the Dutch banking sector was devastated by a financial crisis in the early 1920s, these local banks survived largely unscathed. The religious backgrounds found their way to their organisational structures, as well; Boerenleenbank was highly centralised, while Raiffeisen-Bank promoted local autonomy.

===Merger and overseas expansion===
By 1940, the two organisations cooperated with each other, albeit on a limited scale. Three major developments caused a further tightening of the bonds between the two:
* An increase in the number of branches, leading to increased local competition
* A gradual fading of the confessional differences between the two
* An increasing demand for capital in the Dutch industry, which in turn led to higher concentration in the banking business

In 1972, the two organisations merged to form &quot;Coöperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank&quot;, or Rabobank for short. The organisation chose Amsterdam to be its statutory headquarters due to its historical neutrality in relation to the founding organisations. From 1980 to 2015, the central organisation was referred to as Rabobank Nederland.

In 1980, Rabobank expanded its international activities as part of its mission to finance global agriculture. In 1990, it established a joint-venture bank in Indonesia by partnering with a local bank, Bank Duta, to form RabobankDuta. Bank Duta subsequently collapsed in the 1998 Asian financial crisis, and Rabobank bought Duta&#x27;s share to operate solely as PT Bank Rabobank International Indonesia. In 1994, it purchased Primary Industry Bank of Australia (PIBA), which had operations in Australia and New Zealand, and renamed it Rabobank Australia Limited in 2003. In 1997, it purchased New Zealand–based Wrightson Farmers Finance Limited and renamed it Rabobank New Zealand in 1999. Rabobank became a significant lender to the rural sector in New Zealand with this purchase and used this as a base to expand its lending business further.

In Europe, Rabobank in 1992 purchased Allgemeine Deutsche Credit-Anstalt, a German bank.

===21st century===

In 2002, Rabobank launched a new internet only savings bank called Rabobank.be. A second online savings banks was launched in 2005 in Ireland under the name of RaboDirect, and then as RaboPlus in New Zealand and two years later in Australia. After a small hiatus new online banks were opened in Poland (2011) and Germany (2012). The advertising campaigns used to promote the savings business in Ireland and New Zealand raised the profile of Rabobank generally in those countries resulting in an increase in not only its savings business but also in its lending businesses. In 2010, Rabobank decided to use the same brand name in Australia and New Zealand for the savings bank and replaced RaboPlus with RaboDirect in these countries. In 2014, Rabobank worked with Vasco, now OneSpan, to create a new online authentication system using QR codes.

Rabobank purchased Australian company Lend Lease Agro Business in 2003. In 2008, it expanded its operations in Indonesia by buying two retail banks, Bank Haga and Bank Hagakita.

In the United States, Rabobank completed the acquisition of Mid-State Bank &amp; Trust on May 1, 2007, which allows Rabo to expand its services to the Central Coast region of California, United States. In 2010, it also acquired Pacific State Bank, expanding into the Central Valley of California. Utrecht-America Holdings, Inc. and Rabobank N.A. operate as subsidiaries of the Rabobank Group in the United States. In 2019, it was announced that Rabobank sold its American retail business to Mechanics Bank, with all Rabobank branches taking the Mechanics name. Rabobank will continue to do business in North America related to Food and Agriculture based-lending under its subsidiary Rabo AgriFinance.

In June 2012, rating agency Moody&#x27;s downgraded Rabobank&#x27;s to Aa2 (previously Aaa), with a negative outlook. Due to a new rating methodology in November 2011 by rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, the credit status was downgraded two steps from AAA to AA. In November 2014, S&amp;P lowered the rating from AA− to A+ with a negative outlook. Rating agency Fitch rates the credit status of the bank AA−, with a negative outlook.

As per the new strategy, Rabobank is planning to exit some markets. In September 2014, Rabobank sold Bank BGZ to BNP Paribas for $1.39 billion.

Unlike most major banks, Rabobank&#x27;s central organisation was originally a subsidiary of the local branches. However, new banking regulations made a new arrangement necessary. In late 2015, on the recommendation of a specially-created Governance Committee, Rabobank&#x27;s 106 cooperative banks voted unanimously to merge with Rabobank Nederland. The merger took effect on 1 January 2016. While the 106 Rabobanks still have considerable autonomy, the central organisation is now the parent body.

A 2013 scandal resulted in a $1 billion fine for unscrupulous trading practices, which included the manipulation of LIBOR currency rates worldwide. Chief Executive Piet Moerland resigned immediately as a result.

In December 2015, Rabobank announced to cut 9,000 jobs by 2018 (3,000 jobs by the end of 2016) and almost a fifth of its current workforce. The policy was to comply with the tougher Basel IV rulebook.

By 2019, Rabobank had offices in 38 countries.

==Organisation structure==

The Rabobank Group consists of a network of local banks, Rabobank Nederland and several daughter organisations.

Previously, the local Rabobanks were the mother organisation of Rabobank Nederland, their central organisation. The local banks were facilitated by Rabobank Nederland to serve their customers, not the other way around as is often the case with traditional banking organisations. Employees of the group did not routinely speak of a headquarters but preferred to speak of Rabobank Nederland, which was their daughter organisation. In 2016, however, the local banks merged with Rabobank Nederland, while retaining significant independence.

Even before 2016, the central organisation occasionally overruled the autonomy of the local bank organisations. In accordance with Dutch regulations in the field of credit and financial services Rabobank Nederland oversees that the local banks maintain a required level of prudence and professionalism while selling financial products. This has grown to be especially important in view of international standards such as Sarbanes–Oxley Act, Basel II and IFRS. This leads to a rather unusual phenomenon within international business: the mother companies and the much larger daughter are essentially forced to coexist in order to function properly. This has led to a very ambivalent relationship between the two over the years.

At the time of the merger there were five management instruments within Rabobank Nederland:
# &quot;Algemene Vergadering&quot; – general assembly. The boards of all local banks within the cooperation were represented there.
# &quot;De Centrale Kringvergadering&quot; – advisory board staffed by representatives of clusters of local banks.
# &quot;De Hoofddirectie&quot; – general management. Theoretically they were an autonomous management organ, but in practice, they had to pay &#x27;serious consideration&#x27; to what the 4th organ; &quot;Raad van Beheer&quot;; thought about the course of action for the organisation.
# &quot;Raad van Beheer&quot; – management council. An independent advisory council whose chairman also attended the meetings of &quot;De Hoofddirectie&quot;.
# &quot;Raad van Toezicht&quot; – supervisory board

In 2002 this structure was simplified. The &quot;Raad van Beheer&quot; was disbanded. De &quot;Hoofddirectie&quot; received an integral authority over the banking business. It was also renamed to &quot;Raad van Bestuur&quot; or board of directors. They have an added task compared to a traditional board i.e., they are expected to look out for the specific interests of the members (local banks and their certificate holders). The &quot;Raad van Toezicht&quot; was renamed to county commission and now held an independent supervisory role. The chairman of this board also presides over the &quot;Centrale Kringvergadering&quot;. The latter is the most distinguishing organ as compared to other financial institutions in the Netherlands and abroad.

==Market position==

Rabobank is traditionally a farmers&#x27; bank and it still holds an 85% to 90% market share in the agrarian sector in the Netherlands. Throughout the years, the company has also started targeting small and medium-sized companies. By the mid 1970s the market share in this sector reached some 30% and currently amounts to approximately 40%. In 1987, an important milestone was reached; the total outstanding loans in sectors other than agriculture exceeded those in the agricultural sector for the first time. By 2005 the agricultural credits amounted to some 8% of total outstanding credit.

Rabobank also holds some 40% of the total outstanding sums on Dutch savings accounts and they account for approximately 30% of all private consumer mortgages in the Netherlands.

In the Netherlands, Rabobank is the third-largest retail bank by market share, and second largest by number of current accounts at 30%. ING Group is the largest with 40% of current accounts, followed by Rabobank (30%), ABN AMRO (20%), and others (10%).

== RaboDirect ==
RaboDirect, formerly RaboPlus in some locations is the brand name for online-only services offered by Rabobank. &quot;RaboDirect&quot; operates in Belgium, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Germany offering savings accounts, term deposits and managed funds. In Belgium it is known as Rabobank.be.

=== Ireland ===
RaboDirect Ireland was an online savings bank.

In 2009, RaboDirect ran the marketing campaign that included TV commercials which featured staff confessing truths about themselves, and a microsite called Truthbank where customers could &quot;confess&quot; their own truths.

RaboDirect was the sponsor of rugby union&#x27;s Pro12 from the 2011-12 season until 2013–14, it featured teams from Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. The deal was announced in June 2011, during which time the league was known as the RaboDirect Pro12.

On 21 February RaboDirect announced that it would be closing down its Irish operations from 16 May 2018, with the loss of 31 jobs.

=== New Zealand ===

RaboDirect, originally known as RaboPlus, was launched in February 2006 and was at the time only bank in New Zealand whose parent company was rated AAA by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s (the credit rating has since been downgraded and as of October 2015 is A).

=== Australia ===
On 23 May 2007, Rabobank opened a RaboPlus Internet bank in Australia. On 20 May 2010, the services were rebranded to RaboDirect. RaboDirect is the major partner of the Melbourne Rebels Super Rugby side. By 2011 over $6 billion had been gathered in deposits.

=== Germany ===
On 20 June 2012, Rabobank opened a RaboDirect in Germany. Rabobank has had a presence in Germany since 1984. It has operated in the field of corporate finance and has been primarily active in the food and agriculture sector in the country.

=== Poland ===
Rabobank operated a direct bank in Poland, but under the Bank BGZ operation and using the name &quot;BGZ Optima&quot;. The Polish business including BGZ Optima was subsequently sold to French bank BNP Paribas in December 2013 for around $1.4 billion.

== Naming rights ==
Rabobank has naming rights to several venues and organizations, including:
* Rabobank Stadium, Salinas, California
* Rabobank Development Team, cycling team
* Rabobank-Liv/giant, cycling team
* Rabobank Bestuurscentrum, skyscraper, Utrecht

==Controversies==

=== Libor scandal ===
The major investment banks in London report daily the interest on short-term loans that they charge each other. This concerns short-term interest periods from 1 day to 1 year. When it emerged that some banks had deliberately stated this interest rate too high or too low since 1991, the Libor scandal was born. Because the Libor interest rate is also used in the United States to calculate the price of derivatives, American regulators also took action. Barclays and UBS were the first two participants, settling for $460 million and $1,500 million respectively. RBS was fined $612 million.
On 29 october 2013 was published that the Rabobank had reached an agreement with De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the Dutch Justice Department (OM), the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the United States, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Japanese Financial Services Authority (JFSA). This is in connection with their investigations into Rabobank&#x27;s submission procedures with regard to the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) in the past. Rabobank agreed to pay settlement amounts to OM, FCA, CFTC and DOJ totalling approximately EUR 774 million. Of this, 70 million euros went to the Dutch Public Prosecution Service. In return, no criminal investigation followed. The Dutch Central Bank also took measures. CEO Piet Moerland resigned early.

===Money laundering===
In February 2018, Rabobank reached a settlement with the United States Department of Justice for 298 million euros. The bank did not have its internal controls in order, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in drug money being laundered through the American Rabobank subsidiary RNA in California.

=== Deforestation ===
The &quot;Bankrolling Ecosystem Destruction&quot; report from a coalition of civil society organizations shows how much money is flowing from EU-based financial institutions to sectors that pose a risk to ecosystems, including $30.9 million from Rabobank. The report highlights the importance of EU regulation of the financial sector to align financing with global 1.5 °C and biodiversity targets.

Rabobank has received criticism because the bank was involved in financing hundreds of farmers who committed illegal deforestation in Brazil. This is contrary to the official policy as communicated by the bank. Research links Rabobank&#x27;s investments to the loss of approximately 390,000 ha of Amazon or Cerrado forest (2000–2022). Rabobank has been placed on the list of major polluters of the Dutch NGO Milieudefensie because the bank would have invested more than 1.4 billion euros in companies involved in deforestation in the period from 2015 to 2022.

==Sustainability== 
Rabobank states that it wants to contribute to the sustainable development of society in an economic, social and ecological sense. This is enshrined, among other things, in the Code of Conduct and in general external and internal principles for the provision of services. Corporate social responsibility is a basic principle in Rabobank&#x27;s core activities. Rabobank continues to finance global meat and dairy corporations and thus drives climate change and deforestation.

===Climate=== 
In contrast to the positive publicity from Rabobank, there is criticism from society about its role in the Dutch nitrogen crisis. For example, the World Wildlife Fund (NL) wrote in an open letter that Rabobank must take its responsibility in realizing an agricultural transition to improve nature, the living environment and the agricultural sector. The House of Representatives asked the cabinet in a motion to investigate whether banks such as Rabobank could be forced to contribute to solving the nitrogen crisis.

The bank refused loans to projects with alternative agricultural methods, which led to forced expansion of Dutch livestock farms. Only about 3% of the outstanding 30 billion in the agricultural sector belongs to organically operating companies, farmers receive little or no support in the transition to more sustainable agriculture and livestock farming. Rabobank still invests in expensive techniques, not in solving but in technically mitigating the negative consequences of mass livestock farming and economies of scale.

Extinction Rebellion and Greenpeace issued an ultimatum to Rabobank in 2023 to stop financing industrial agriculture, to which the bank did not respond. A mass protest followed in which activists blocked the head office in Utrecht.

<text>Jiyuan () is a sub-prefecture-level city in northwestern Henan province, People&#x27;s Republic of China. It borders the prefecture-level cities of Jiaozuo and Luoyang to the east and southwest respectively, as well as the province of Shanxi to the north.

==Administration==
The sub-prefecture-level city of Jiyuan administers 5 subdistrict and 11 towns. Jiyuan is named after the Ji river whose source is said to be a spring located on the west of the city.

==Mythology==
*A famous Chinese mythology The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains may come from this area. Mountains mentioned in this myth are Taihang and Wangwu.

==History==
Jiyuan was a county belonging to Jiaozuo City in the past, then it was divided from the city. The former Ji River—one of the ancient &quot;Four Rivers&quot;, alongside the Yangtze, Huai, and Yellow Rivers—originated around Jiyuan, which was the source of its name, Chinese for &quot;Source of the Ji&quot;. (Today, the Ji has been entirely subsumed by the Yellow River, which shifted to the bed of the Ji during its massive 1852 flood.) According to the latest archaeological findings, as early as around 10,000 years ago, precisely at the end of the Paleolithic Period and the beginning of the Neolithic Period, people have lived here. It used to be the capital of the Xia Dynasty and was well known for its wealth between the Period of Warring States and Han Dynasty.

In Shang dynasty it was a Fang state - Ya (亞方).

==Agriculture==
There are many crops grown in Jiyuan, such as wheat, peanut, cotton, sweet potato, maize and other crops.

<text>; ) is a village in the community of Pentyrch, Cardiff in Wales.

== Location ==
Gwaelod-y-garth is located in Taff Valley at the foot of Garth Hill, north of central Cardiff and south of Pontypridd. The castle of Castell Coch is within reach of the village, by car or on foot.

== History ==
In Elizabethan times, Gwaelod-y-Garth was noted for its iron-ore mines. The mines were opened between 1565 and 1625, and re-opened in the 19th century by the Blackmoor Booker company. In the early 1990s, a campaign was held to save the site.

The Pentyrch Iron Works was opened in Gwaelod-y-Garth in 1740 (Gwaelod-y-Garth was then in the parish of Pentyrch). It supplied iron to the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works in Whitchurch, about downriver. In 1812 a tramway was constructed to the Mellingriffith Works; in 1871 this was upgraded to the standard-gauge Melingriffith and Pentyrch Railway. An Ordnance Survey map revised in 1915 shows the works as &#x27;disused&#x27;. The forge from the ironworks was demolished in 1977 and the site is now used for housing.

== Amenities ==
Amenities include a Royal Mail collection point, Garth Tyres yard and a police car park, from where South Wales Police Roads Policing Unit is run. There is also a large playing field named Heol Berry, where local amateur football team Gwaelod Rangers plays. At the top end of the village is the village pub, the Gwaelod Y Garth Inn. Situated in the village is Gwaelod-y-Garth Primary School, a school that educates through both the medium of Welsh and English. The students are separated into two sections of the school (English and Welsh). The village has a Welsh medium chapel called Bethlehem built in 1832.

<doc id="465971" wikidata="Q1199213" url="?curid=465971" title="History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)">
<text>The history of the Soviet Union between 1927 and 1953, commonly referred to as the Stalin Era or the Stalinist Era, covers the period in Soviet history from the establishment of Stalinism through victory in the Second World War and down to the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953. Stalin sought to destroy his enemies while transforming Soviet society with central planning, in particular through the forced collectivization of agriculture and rapid development of heavy industry. Stalin consolidated his power within the party and the state and fostered an extensive cult of personality. Soviet secret-police and the mass-mobilization of the Communist Party served as Stalin&#x27;s major tools in molding Soviet society. Stalin&#x27;s methods in achieving his goals, which included party purges, ethnic cleansings, political repression of the general population, and forced collectivization, led to millions of deaths: in Gulag labor camps and during famine.

World War II, known as &quot;the Great Patriotic War&quot; by Soviet historians, devastated much of the USSR, with about one out of every three World War II deaths representing a citizen of the Soviet Union. In the course of World War II, the Soviet Union&#x27;s armies occupied Eastern Europe, where they established or supported Communist puppet governments. By 1949, the Cold War had started between the Western Bloc and the Eastern (Soviet) Bloc, with the Warsaw Pact (created 1955) pitched against NATO (created 1949) in Europe. After 1945, Stalin did not directly engage in any wars, continuing his totalitarian rule until his death in 1953.

==Soviet state&#x27;s development==

===Industrialization in practice===

The mobilization of resources by state planning expanded the country&#x27;s industrial base. From 1928 to 1932, pig iron output, necessary for further development of the industrial infrastructure rose from 3.3 million to 6.2 million tons per year. Coal production, a basic fuel of modern economies and Stalinist industrialization, rose from 35.4 million to 64 million tons, and the output of iron ore rose from 5.7 million to 19 million tons. A number of industrial complexes such as Magnitogorsk and Kuznetsk, the Moscow and Gorky automobile plants, the Ural Mountains and Kramatorsk heavy machinery plants, and Kharkiv, Stalingrad and Chelyabinsk tractor plants had been built or were under construction.

In real terms, the workers&#x27; standards of living tended to drop, rather than rise during industrialization. Stalin&#x27;s laws to &quot;tighten work discipline&quot; made the situation worse: e.g., a 1932 change to the RSFSR labor law code enabled firing workers who had been absent without a reason from the workplace for just one day. Being fired accordingly meant losing &quot;the right to use ration and commodity cards&quot; as well as the &quot;loss of the right to use an apartment″ and even blacklisted for new employment which altogether meant a threat of starving. Those measures, however, were not fully enforced, as managers were hard-pressed to replace these workers. In contrast, the 1938 legislation, which introduced labor books, followed by major revisions of the labor law, was enforced. For example, being absent or even 20 minutes late were grounds for becoming fired; managers who failed to enforce these laws faced criminal prosecution. Later, the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, 26 June 1940 &quot;On the Transfer to the Eight-Hour Working Day, the Seven-day Work Week, and on the Prohibition of Unauthorized Departure by Laborers and Office Workers from Factories and Offices&quot; replaced the 1938 revisions with obligatory criminal penalties for quitting a job (2–4 months imprisonment), for being late 20 minutes (6 months of probation and pay confiscation of 25 per cent), etc.

Based on these figures, the Soviet government declared that the Five Year Industrial Production Plan had been fulfilled by 93.7% in only four years, while parts devoted to the heavy industry parts were fulfilled by 108%. Stalin in December 1932 declared the plan success to the Central Committee since increases in the output of coal and iron would fuel future development.

During the Second Five-Year Plan (1933–1937), on the basis of the huge investment during the first plan, the industry expanded extremely rapidly and nearly reached the plan&#x27;s targets. By 1937, coal output was 127 million tons, pig iron 14.5 million tons, and there had been very rapid development of the armaments industry.

While making a massive leap in industrial capacity, the First Five Year Plan was extremely harsh on industrial workers; quotas were difficult to fulfill, requiring that miners put in 16- to 18-hour workdays. Failure to fulfill quotas could result in treason charges. Working conditions were poor, even hazardous. Due to the allocation of resources for the industry along with decreasing productivity since collectivization, a famine occurred. In the construction of the industrial complexes, inmates of Gulag camps were used as expendable resources. But conditions improved rapidly during the second plan. Throughout the 1930s, industrialization was combined with a rapid expansion of technical and engineering education as well as increasing emphasis on munitions.

From 1921 until 1954, the police state operated at high intensity, seeking out anyone accused of sabotaging the system. The estimated numbers vary greatly. Perhaps, 3.7 million people were sentenced for alleged counter-revolutionary crimes, including 600,000 sentenced to death, 2.4 million sentenced to labor camps, and 700,000 sentenced to expatriation. Stalinist repression reached its peak during the Great Purge of 1937–1938, which removed many skilled managers and experts and considerably slowed industrial production in 1937.

==Economy==
===Collectivization of agriculture===
Under the NEP (New Economic Policy), Lenin had to tolerate the continued existence of privately owned agriculture. He decided to wait at least 20 years before attempting to place it under state control and in the meantime concentrate on industrial development. However, after Stalin&#x27;s rise to power, the timetable for collectivization was shortened to just five years. Demand for food intensified, especially in the USSR&#x27;s primary grain producing regions, with new, forced approaches implemented. Upon joining kolkhozes (collective farms), peasants had to give up their private plots of land and property. Every harvest, Kolkhoz production was sold to the state for a low price set by the state itself. However, the natural progress of collectivization was slow, and the November 1929 Plenum of the Central Committee decided to accelerate collectivization through force. In any case, Russian peasant culture formed a bulwark of traditionalism that stood in the way of the Soviet state&#x27;s goals.

Given the goals of the first Five Year Plan, the state sought increased political control of agriculture in order to feed the rapidly growing urban population and to obtain a source of foreign currency through increased cereal exports. Given its late start, the USSR needed to import a substantial number of the expensive technologies necessary for heavy industrialization.

By 1936, about 90% of Soviet agriculture had been collectivized. In many cases, peasants bitterly opposed this process and often slaughtered their animals rather than give them to collective farms, even though the government only wanted the grain. Kulaks, prosperous peasants, were forcibly resettled to Kazakhstan, Siberia and the Russian Far North (a large portion of the kulaks served at forced labor camps). However, just about anyone opposing collectivization was deemed a &quot;kulak&quot;. The policy of liquidation of kulaks as a class—formulated by Stalin at the end of 1929—meant some executions, and even more deportation to special settlements and, sometimes, to forced labor camps.

Despite the expectations, collectivization led to a catastrophic drop in farm productivity, which did not return to the levels achieved under the NEP until 1940. The upheaval associated with collectivization was particularly severe in Ukraine and the heavily Ukrainian Volga region. Peasants slaughtered their livestock en masse rather than give them up. In 1930 alone, 25% of the nation&#x27;s cattle, sheep, and goats, and one-third of all pigs were killed. It was not until the 1980s that the Soviet livestock numbers would return to their 1928 level. Government bureaucrats, who had been given a rudimentary education on farming techniques, were dispatched to the countryside to &quot;teach&quot; peasants the new ways of socialist agriculture, relying largely on theoretical ideas that had little basis in reality. Even after the state inevitably won and succeeded in imposing collectivization, the peasants did everything they could in the way of sabotage. They cultivated far smaller portions of their land and worked much less. The scale of the Ukrainian famine has led many Ukrainian scholars to argue that there was a deliberate policy of genocide against the Ukrainian people. Other scholars argue that the massive death totals were an inevitable result of a very poorly planned operation against all peasants, who had given little support to Lenin or Stalin. 
In Ukraine alone, the number of people who died in the famines is now estimated to be 3.5 million.

The USSR took over Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1940, which were lost to Germany in 1941, and then recovered in 1944. The collectivization of their farms began in 1948. Using terror, mass killings and deportations, most of the peasantry was collectivized by 1952. Agricultural production fell dramatically in all the other Soviet Republics.

===Rapid industrialization===

In the period of rapid industrialization and mass collectivization preceding World War II, Soviet employment figures experienced exponential growth. 3.9 million jobs per annum were expected by 1923, but the number actually climbed to an astounding 6.4 million. By 1937, the number rose yet again, to about 7.9 million. Finally, in 1940 it reached 8.3 million. Between 1926 and 1930, the urban population increased by 30 million. Unemployment had been a problem in late Imperial Russia and even under the NEP, but it ceased being a major factor after the implementation of Stalin&#x27;s massive industrialization program. The sharp mobilization of resources used in order to industrialize the heretofore agrarian society created a massive need for labor; unemployment virtually dropped to zero. Wage setting by Soviet planners also contributed to the sharp decrease in unemployment, which dropped in real terms by 50% from 1928 to 1940. With wages artificially depressed, the state could afford to employ far more workers than would be financially viable in a market economy. Several ambitious extraction projects were begun that endeavored to supply raw materials for both military hardware and consumer goods.

The Moscow and Gorky automobile plants produced automobiles for the public—despite few Soviet citizens being able to afford a car—and the expansion of steel production and other industrial materials made the manufacture of a greater number of cars possible. Car and truck production, for example, reached 200,000 in 1931.

A minimum wage of 110–115 rubles was established in 1937; private gardens were allowed for one million workers to farm in their private plots. Even so, most Soviet workers lived in crowded communal housings and dormitories and suffered from extreme poverty.

==Society==
===Propaganda===
Most of the top communist leaders in the 1920s and 1930s had been propagandists or editors before 1917, and were keenly aware of the importance of propaganda. As soon as they gained power in 1917 they seized the monopoly of all communication media, and greatly expanded their propaganda apparatus in terms of newspapers, magazines and pamphlets. Radio became a powerful tool in the 1930s. Stalin, for example, has been an editor of &quot;Pravda&quot;. Besides the national newspapers &quot;Pravda&quot; and &quot;Izvestia,&quot; there were numerous regional publications as well as newspapers and magazines and all the important languages. Ironclad uniformity of opinion was the norm during the Soviet era. Typewriters and printing presses were closely controlled until the late 1980s to prevent unauthorized publications. Samizdat illegal circulation of subversive fiction and nonfiction was brutally suppressed. The rare exceptions to 100% uniformity in the official media were indicators of high-level battles. The Soviet draft constitution of 1936 was an instance. &quot;Pravda&quot; and &quot;Trud&quot; (the paper for manual workers) praised the draft constitution. However &quot;Izvestiia&quot; was controlled by Nikolai Bukharin and it published negative letters and reports. Bukharin won out and the party line changed and started to attack &quot;Trotskyite&quot; oppositionists and traitors. Bukharin&#x27;s success was short-lived; he was arrested in 1937, given a show trial and executed.

===Education===

Industrial workers needed to be educated in order to be competitive and so embarked on a program contemporaneous with industrialization to greatly increase the number of schools and the general quality of education. In 1927, 7.9 million students attended 118,558 schools. By 1933, the number rose to 9.7 million students in 166,275 schools. In addition, 900 specialist departments and 566 institutions were built and fully operational by 1933. Literacy rates increased substantially as a result, especially in the Central Asian republics.

===Women===

The Soviet people also benefited from a type of social liberalization. Women were to be given the same education as men and, at least legally speaking, obtained the same rights as men in the workplace. Although in practice these goals were not reached, the efforts to achieve them and the statement of theoretical equality led to a general improvement in the socio-economic status of women.

Women were notably recruited as clerks for the expanding department stores, resulting in a &quot;feminization&quot; of department stores as the number of female sales staff rose from 45 percent of the total sales staff in 1935 to 62 percent of the total sales staff in 1938. This was in part due to a propaganda campaign launched in 1931 which linked femininity with &quot;culture&quot; and asserted that the New Soviet Woman was also a working woman. Furthermore, department store staff had a low status in the Soviet Union and many men did not want to work as sales staff, leading to the jobs as sales staff going to poorly educated working-class women and from women newly arrived in the cities from the countryside.

However, many rights were rolled back by the authorities during this era, such as abortion, which was legalized before Stalin came to power, was banned in 1936 after controversial debate among citizens. Women&#x27;s issues were also largely ignored by the government.

===Health===

Stalinist development also contributed to advances in health care, which marked a massive improvement over the Imperial era. Stalin&#x27;s policies granted the Soviet people access to free health care and education. Widespread immunization programs created the first generation free from the fear of typhus and cholera. The occurrences of these diseases dropped to record-low numbers and infant mortality rates were substantially reduced, resulting in the life expectancy for both men and women to increase by over 20 years by the mid-to-late 1950s.

===Youth===

The Komsomol or Youth Communist League, was an entirely new youth organization designed by Lenin became an enthusiastic strike force that organized communism across the Soviet Union often called on to attack traditional enemies. The Komsomol played an important role as a mechanism for teaching Party values to the younger generation. The Komsomol also served as a mobile pool of labor and political activism, with the ability to relocate to areas of high-priority at short notice. In the 1920s the Kremlin assigned Komsomol major responsibilities for promoting industrialization at the factory level. In 1929 7,000 Komsomol cadets were building the tractor factory in Stalingrad, 56,000 others built factories in the Urals, and 36,000 were assigned work underground in the coal mines. The goal was to provide an energetic hard-core of Bolshevik activists to influence their coworkers the factories and mines that were at the center of communist ideology.

Komsomol adopted meritocratic, supposedly class-blind membership policies in 1935, but the result was a decline in working class youth members, and a dominance by the better educated youth. A new social hierarchy emerged as young professionals and students joined the Soviet elite, displacing proletarians. Komsomol&#x27;s membership policies in the 1930s reflected the broader nature of Stalinism, combining Leninist rhetoric about class-free progress with Stalinist pragmatism focused on getting the most enthusiastic and skilled membership. Under Stalin, the death penalty was also extended to adolescents as young as 12 years old in 1935.

===Modernity===
Urban women under Stalin, paralleling the modernization of western countries, were also the first generation of women able to give birth in a hospital with access to prenatal care. Education was another area in which there was improvement after economic development, also paralleling other western countries. The generation born during Stalin&#x27;s rule was the first near-universally literate generation. Some engineers were sent abroad to learn industrial technology, and hundreds of foreign engineers were brought to Russia on contract. Transport links were also improved, as many new railways were built, although with forced labour, costing thousands of lives. Workers who exceeded their quotas, &quot;Stakhanovites&quot;, received many incentives for their work, although many such workers were in fact &quot;arranged&quot; to succeed by receiving extreme help in their work, and then their achievements were used for propaganda.

===Religion===
The systematic attacks on the Russian Orthodox Church began as soon as the Bolsheviks took power in 1917. In the 1930s, Stalin intensified his war on organized religion. Nearly all churches and monasteries were closed and tens of thousands of clergymen were imprisoned or executed. Historian Dimitry Pospielovski has estimated that between 5,000 and 10,000 Orthodox clergy died by execution or in prison 1918–1929, plus an additional 45,000 in 1930–1939. Monks, nuns, and related personnel added an additional 40,000 dead.

The state propaganda machine vigorously promoted atheism and denounced religion as being an artifact of capitalist society. In 1937, Pope Pius XI decried the attacks on religion in the Soviet Union. By 1940, only a small number of churches remained open. The early anti-religious campaigns under Lenin were mostly directed at the Russian Orthodox Church, as it was a symbol of the czarist government. In the 1930s however, all faiths were targeted: minority Christian denominations, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism. During World War II state authorities eased pressures on Religion in Russia and stopped prosecuting the church. The Orthodox Church was, therefore, able to help the Soviet Army to defend Russia. Religions in former USSR republics revived and once again flourished after the fall of communism in the 1990s. As Paul Froese explains:
:Atheists waged a 70-year war on religious belief in the Soviet Union. The Communist Party destroyed churches, mosques, and temples; it executed religious leaders; it flooded the schools and media with anti-religious propaganda; and it introduced a belief system called “scientific atheism,” complete with atheist rituals, proselytizers, and a promise of worldly salvation. But in the end, a majority of older Soviet citizens retained their religious beliefs and a crop of citizens too young to have experienced pre-Soviet times acquired religious beliefs.

According to 2012 official statistics, nearly 15% of ethnic Russians identify as atheist, and nearly 27% identify as unaffiliated.

===Ethnic policies===

The Soviet Union authorities systematically promoted the national consciousness of indigenous peoples and established institutional forms 
characteristic of a modern nation for them. In Central Asia the liberation of women was approached in the same revolutionary way as the assault on the religion. In 1927 the campaign against paranja (veil) started, called &quot;hujum&quot; (assault). However, it produced a massive backlash and paranja did not disappear until the 1950s.

In 1937, as a part of the Great Purge, repressive “national operations” were conducted. Representatives of “Western” minorities were targeted 
because of their possible connections to countries hostile to the USSR and fear of disloyalty in case of an invasion.

==Great Purge==
As this process unfolded, Stalin consolidated near-absolute power by destroying the potential opposition. In 1936–1938, about three quarters of a million Soviets were executed, and more than a million others were sentenced to lengthy terms in harsh labour camps. Stalin&#x27;s Great Terror ravaged the ranks of factory directors and engineers, and removed most of the senior officers in the Army. The pretext was the 1934 assassination of Sergei Kirov (which many suspect Stalin of having planned, although there is no evidence for this). Nearly all the old pre-1918 Bolsheviks were purged. Trotsky was expelled from the party in 1927, exiled to Kazakhstan in 1928, expelled from the USSR in 1929, and assassinated in 1940. Stalin used the purges to politically and physically destroy his other formal rivals (and former allies) accusing Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev of being behind Kirov&#x27;s assassination and planning to overthrow Stalin. Ultimately, the people arrested were tortured and forced to confess to being spies and saboteurs, and quickly convicted and executed.

Several show trials were held in Moscow, to serve as examples for the trials that local courts were expected to carry out elsewhere in the country. There were four key trials from 1936 to 1938, The Trial of the Sixteen was the first (December 1936); then the Trial of the Seventeen (January 1937); then the trial of Red Army generals, including Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky (June 1937); and finally the Trial of the Twenty One (including Bukharin) in March 1938. During these, the defendants typically confessed to sabotage, spying, counter-revolution, and conspiring with Germany and Japan to invade and partition the Soviet Union. The initial trials in 1935–1936 were carried out by the OGPU under Genrikh Yagoda. In turn the prosecutors were tried and executed. The secret police were renamed the NKVD and control given to Nikolai Yezhov, known as the &quot;Bloody Dwarf&quot;.

The &quot;Great Purge&quot; swept the Soviet Union in 1937. It was widely known as the &quot;Yezhovschina&quot;, the &quot;Reign of Yezhov&quot;. The rate of arrests was staggering. In the armed forces alone, 34,000 officers were purged, including many at the higher ranks. The entire Politburo and most of the Central Committee were purged, along with foreign communists who were living in the Soviet Union, and numerous intellectuals, bureaucrats, and factory managers. The total of people imprisoned or executed during the Yezhovschina numbered about two million. By 1938, the mass purges were starting to disrupt the country&#x27;s infrastructure, and Stalin began winding them down. Yezhov was gradually relieved of power. Yezhov was relieved of all powers in 1939, then tried and executed in 1940. His successor as head of the NKVD (from 1938 to 1945) was Lavrentiy Beria, a Georgian friend of Stalin&#x27;s. Arrests and executions continued into 1952, although nothing on the scale of the Yezhovschina ever happened again.

During this period, the practice of mass arrest, torture, and imprisonment or execution without trial, of anyone suspected by the secret police of opposing Stalin&#x27;s regime became commonplace. By the NKVD&#x27;s own count, 681,692 people were shot during 1937–1938 alone, and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners were transported to Gulag work camps.
The mass terror and purges were little known to the outside world, and some western intellectuals and fellow travellers continued to believe that the Soviets had created a successful alternative to a capitalist world. In 1936, the country adopted its first formal constitution, which only on paper granted freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. Scholars estimate the total death toll for the Great Purge (1936–1938), including fatalities attributed to prison conditions, to be roughly 700,000-1.2 million. 

In March 1939, the 18th congress of the Communist Party was held in Moscow. Most of the delegates present at the 17th congress in 1934 were gone, and Stalin was heavily praised by Litvinov and the western democracies criticized for failing to adopt the principles of &quot;collective security&quot; against Nazi Germany.

===Interpreting the purges===
Two major lines of interpretation have emerged among historians. One argues that the purges reflected Stalin&#x27;s ambitions, his paranoia, and his inner drive to increase his power and eliminate potential rivals. Revisionist historians explain the purges by theorizing that rival factions exploited Stalin&#x27;s paranoia and used terror to enhance their own position. Peter Whitewood examines the first purge, directed at the Army, and comes up with a third interpretation that: Stalin and other top leaders, assuming that they were always surrounded by enemies, always worried about the vulnerability and loyalty of the Red Army. It was not a ploy – Stalin truly believed it. “Stalin attacked the Red Army because he seriously misperceived a serious security threat”; thus “Stalin seems to have genuinely believed that foreign‐backed enemies had infiltrated the ranks and managed to organize a conspiracy at the very heart of the Red Army.” The purge hit deeply from June 1937 and November 1938, removing 35,000; many were executed. Experience in carrying out the purge facilitated purging other key elements in the wider Soviet polity. Historians often cite the disruption as factors in its disastrous military performance during the German invasion.

==Foreign relations, 1927–1939==

The Soviet government had forfeited foreign-owned private companies during the creation of the RSFSR and the USSR. Foreign investors did not receive any monetary or material compensation. The USSR also refused to pay tsarist-era debts to foreign debtors. The young Soviet polity was a pariah because of its openly stated goal of supporting the overthrow of capitalistic governments. It sponsored workers&#x27; revolts to overthrow numerous capitalistic European states, but they all failed. Lenin reversed radical experiments and restored a sort of capitalism with the NEC. The Comintern was ordered to stop organizing revolts. Starting in 1921 Lenin sought trade, loans and recognition. One by one, foreign states reopened trade lines and recognized the Soviet government. The United States was the last major polity to recognise the USSR in 1933. In 1934, the French government proposed an alliance and led 30 governments to invite the USSR to join the League of Nations. The USSR had achieved legitimacy but was expelled in December 1939 for aggression against Finland.

In 1928, Stalin pushed a leftist policy based on his belief in an imminent great crisis for capitalism. Various European communist parties were ordered not to form coalitions and instead to denounce moderate socialists as social fascists. Activists were sent into labour unions to take control away from socialists–a move the British unions never forgave. By 1930, the Stalinists started suggesting the value of alliance with other parties, and by 1934 the idea to form a Popular Front had emerged. Comintern agent Willi Münzenberg was especially effective in organizing intellectuals, antiwar and pacifist elements to join the anti-Nazi coalition. Communists would form coalitions with any party to fight fascism. For Stalinists, the Popular Front was simply an expedient, but to rightists, it represented the desirable form of transition to socialism.

Franco-Soviet relations were initially hostile because the USSR officially opposed the World War I peace settlement of 1919 that France emphatically championed. While the Soviet Union was interested in conquering territories in Eastern Europe, France was determined to protect the fledgling states there. However, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s foreign policy centered on a massive seizure of Central European, Eastern European, and Russian lands for Germany&#x27;s own ends, and when Hitler pulled out of the World Disarmament Conference in Geneva in 1933, the threat hit home. Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov reversed Soviet policy regarding the Paris Peace Settlement, leading to a Franco-Soviet rapprochement. In May 1935, the USSR concluded pacts of mutual assistance with France and Czechoslovakia. Stalin-ordered the Comintern to form a popular front with leftist and centrist parties against the forces of Fascism. The pact was undermined, however, by strong ideological hostility to the Soviet Union and the Comintern&#x27;s new front in France, Poland&#x27;s refusal to permit the Red Army on its soil, France&#x27;s defensive military strategy, and a continuing Soviet interest in patching up relations with Nazi Germany.

The Soviet Union supplied military aid to the Republican faction of the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War, including munitions and soldiers, and helped far-left activists come to Spain as volunteers. The Spanish government let the USSR have the government treasury. Soviet units systematically liquidated anarchist supporters of the Spanish government. Moscow&#x27;s support of the government gave the Republicans a Communist taint in the eyes of anti-Bolsheviks in Britain and France, weakening the calls for Anglo-French intervention in the war.

Nazi Germany promulgated an Anti-Comintern Pact with Imperialist Japan and Fascist Italy, along with various Central and Eastern European states (such as Hungary), ostensibly to suppress Communist activity but more realistically to forge an alliance against the USSR.

== World War II ==

Stalin arranged the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany on 23 August along with the German-Soviet Commercial Agreement to open economic relations. A secret appendix to the pact gave Eastern Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Bessarabia and Finland to the USSR, and Western Poland and Lithuania to Nazi Germany. This reflected the Soviet desire of territorial gains.

Following the pact with Hitler, Stalin in 1939–1940 annexed half of Poland, the three Baltic States, and Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia in Romania. They no longer were buffers separating the USSR from German areas, argues Louis Fischer. Rather they facilitated Hitler&#x27;s rapid advance to the gates of Moscow.

Propaganda was also considered an important foreign relations tool. International exhibitions, the distribution of media such as films, e.g.: &quot;Alexander Nevski&quot;, as well as inviting prominent foreign individuals to tour the Soviet Union, were used as a method of gaining international influence and encouraging fellow travelers and pacifists to build popular fronts.

===Start of World War II===

Germany invaded Poland on 1 September; the USSR followed on 17 September. The Soviets quelled opposition by executing and arresting thousands. They relocated suspect ethnic groups to Siberia in four waves, 1939–1941. Estimates varying from the figure over 1.5 million.

After Poland was divided up with Germany, Stalin made territorial demands to Finland, claiming security needs regarding the protection of Leningrad. After the Finns refused the demands, the Soviets invaded Finland on 30 November 1939, launching the Winter War, with the goal of annexing Finland into the Soviet Union. Despite outnumbering Finnish troops by over 2.5:1, the war proved embarrassingly difficult for the Red Army, which was ill-equipped for the winter weather and lacking competent commanders since the purge of the Soviet high command. The Finns resisted fiercely, and received some support and considerable sympathy from the Allies. On 29 January 1940, the Soviets put an end to their puppet Terijoki Government that they had intended on inserting into Helsinki, and informed the Finnish government that the Soviet Union was willing to negotiate peace. The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed on 12 March 1940, with the war ending the following day. By the terms of the treaty, Finland relinquished the Karelian Isthmus and some smaller territories. London, Washington—and especially Berlin—calculated that the poor showing of the Soviet army indicated it was incompetent to defend the USSR against a German invasion.

In 1940, the USSR occupied and illegally annexed Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. On 14 June 1941, the USSR performed first mass deportations from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

On 26 June 1940 the Soviet government issued an ultimatum to the Romanian minister in Moscow, demanding the Kingdom of Romania immediately cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Italy and Germany, which needed a stable Romania and access to its oil fields urged King Carol II to do so. Under duress, with no prospect of aid from France or Britain, Carol complied. On 28 June, Soviet troops crossed the Dniester and occupied Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertsa region.

===Great Patriotic War===
On 22 June 1941, Adolf Hitler abruptly broke the non-aggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union. Stalin had made no preparations. Soviet intelligence was fooled by German disinformation and the invasion caught the Soviet military unprepared. In the larger sense, Stalin expected invasion but not so soon. The Army had been decimated by the Purges; time was needed for a recovery of competence. As such, mobilization did not occur and the Soviet Army was tactically unprepared as of the invasion. The initial weeks of the war were a disaster, with hundreds of thousands of men being killed, wounded, or captured. Whole divisions disintegrated against the German onslaught. Soviet POWs in German prison camps were treated poorly, leading to only 1/10 of Red Army POWs surviving German camps. In contrast, 1/3 of German POWs survived the Soviet prison camps.
German troops reached the outskirts of Moscow in December 1941, but failed to capture it, due to staunch Soviet defence and counterattacks. At the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942–1943, the Red Army inflicted a crushing defeat on the German army. Due to the unwillingness of the Japanese to open a second front in Manchuria, the Soviets were able to call dozens of Red Army divisions back from eastern Russia. These units were instrumental in turning the tide, because most of their officer corps had escaped Stalin&#x27;s purges. The Soviet forces soon launched massive counterattacks along the entire German line. By 1944, the Germans had been pushed out of the Soviet Union onto the banks of the Vistula river, just east of Prussia. With Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov attacking from Prussia, and Marshal Ivan Konev slicing Germany in half from the south, the fate of Nazi Germany was sealed. On 2 May 1945 the last German troops surrendered to the Soviet troops in Berlin.

===Wartime developments===

From the end of 1944 to 1949, large sections of eastern Germany came under the Soviet Union&#x27;s occupation and on 2 May 1945, the capital city Berlin was taken, while over fifteen million Germans were removed from eastern Germany (renamed the Recovered Territories of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic) and pushed into central Germany (later called the German Democratic Republic) and western Germany (later called the Federal Republic of Germany).

An atmosphere of patriotic emergency took over the Soviet Union during the war, and persecution of the Orthodox Church was halted. The Church was now permitted to operate with a fair degree of freedom, so long as it did not get involved in politics. In 1944, a new Soviet national anthem was written, replacing the Internationale, which had been used as the national anthem since 1918. These changes were made because it was thought that the people would respond better to a fight for their country than for a political ideology.

The Soviets bore the brunt of World War II because the West did not open up a second ground front in Europe until the invasion of Italy and the Battle of Normandy. Approximately 26.6 million Soviets, among them 18 million civilians, were killed in the war. Civilians were rounded up and burned or shot in many cities conquered by the Nazis. The retreating Soviet army was ordered to pursue a &#x27;scorched earth&#x27; policy whereby retreating Soviet troops were ordered to destroy civilian infrastructure and food supplies so that the Nazi German troops could not use them.

Stalin&#x27;s original declaration in March 1946 that there were 7 million war dead was revised in 1956 by Nikita Khrushchev with a round number of 20 million. In the late 1980s, demographers in the State Statistics Committee (Goskomstat) took another look using demographic methods and came up with an estimate of 26–27 million. A variety of other estimates have been made. In most detailed estimates roughly two-thirds of the estimated deaths were civilian losses. However, the breakdown of war losses by nationality is less well known. One study, relying on indirect evidence from the 1959 population census, found that while in terms of the aggregate human losses the major Slavic groups suffered most, the largest losses relative to population size were incurred by minority nationalities mainly from European Russia, among groups from which men were mustered to the front in &quot;nationality battalions&quot; and appear to have suffered disproportionately.

After the war, the Soviet Union occupied and dominated Eastern Europe, in line with Soviet ideology.

Stalin was determined to punish those peoples he saw as collaborating with Germany during the war and to deal with the problem of nationalism, which would tend to pull the Soviet Union apart. Millions of Poles, Latvians, Georgians, Ukrainians and other ethnic minorities were deported to Gulags in Siberia. (Previously, following the 1939 annexation of eastern Poland, thousands of Polish Army officers, including reservists, had been executed in the spring of 1940, in what came to be known as the Katyn massacre.) In addition, in 1941, 1943 and 1944 several whole nationalities had been deported to Siberia, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia, including, among others, the Volga Germans, Chechens, Ingush, Balkars, Crimean Tatars, and Meskhetian Turks. Though these groups were later politically &quot;rehabilitated&quot;, some were never given back their former autonomous regions.

At the same time, in a famous Victory Day toast in May 1945, Stalin extolled the role of the Russian people in the defeat of the fascists: &quot;I would like to raise a toast to the health of our Soviet people and, before all, the Russian people. I drink, before all, to the health of the Russian people, because in this war they earned general recognition as the leading force of the Soviet Union among all the nationalities of our country... And this trust of the Russian people in the Soviet Government was the decisive strength, which secured the historic victory over the enemy of humanity – over fascism...&quot;

World War II resulted in enormous destruction of infrastructure and populations throughout Eurasia, from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans, with almost no country left unscathed. The Soviet Union was especially devastated due to the mass destruction of the industrial base that it had built up in the 1930s. The USSR also experienced a major famine in 1946–1948 due to war devastation that cost an estimated 1 to 1.5 million lives as well as secondary population losses due to reduced fertility. However, the Soviet Union recovered its production capabilities and overcame pre-war capabilities, becoming the country with the most powerful land army in history by the end of the war, and having the most powerful military production capabilities.

====War and Stalinist industrial-military development====

Although the Soviet Union received aid and weapons from the United States under the Lend-Lease program, the Soviet production of war materials was greater than that of Nazi Germany because of rapid growth of Soviet industrial production during the interwar years (additional supplies from lend-lease accounted for about 10–12% of the Soviet Union&#x27;s own industrial output). The Second Five Year Plan raised steel production to 18 million tons and coal to 128 million tons. Before it was interrupted, the Third Five Year Plan produced no less than 19 million tons of steel and 150 million tons of coal.

The Soviet Union&#x27;s industrial output provided an armaments industry which supported their army, helping it resist the Nazi military offensive. According to Robert L. Hutchings, &quot;One can hardly doubt that if there had been a slower buildup of industry, the attack would have been successful and world history would have evolved quite differently.&quot; For the laborers involved in industry, however, life was difficult. Workers were encouraged to fulfill and overachieve quotas through propaganda, such as the Stakhanovite movement.

Some historians, however, interpret the lack of preparedness of the Soviet Union to defend itself as a flaw in Stalin&#x27;s economic planning. David Shearer, for example, argues that there was &quot;a command-administrative economy&quot; but it was not &quot;a planned one&quot;. He argues that the Soviet Union was still suffering from the Great Purge, and was completely unprepared for the German invasion. Economist Holland Hunter, in addition, argues in his &quot;Overambitious First Soviet Five-Year Plan&quot;, that an array &quot;of alternative paths were available, evolving out of the situation existing at the end of the 1920s... that could have been as good as those achieved by, say, 1936 yet with far less turbulence, waste, destruction and sacrifice.&quot;

==Cold War==
===Soviet control over Eastern Europe===
In the aftermath of World War II, the Soviet Union extended its political and military influence over Eastern Europe, in a move that was seen by some as a continuation of the older policies of the Russian Empire. Some territories that had been lost by Soviet Russia in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918) were annexed by the Soviet Union after World War II: the Baltic states and eastern portions of interwar Poland. The Russian SFSR also gained the northern half of East Prussia (Kaliningrad Oblast) from Germany. The Ukrainian SSR gained Transcarpathia (as Zakarpattia Oblast) from Czechoslovakia, and Ukrainian populated Northern Bukovina (as Chernivtsi Oblast) from Romania. Finally, by the late 1940s, pro-Soviet Communist Parties won the elections in five countries of Central and Eastern Europe (specifically Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria) and subsequently became People&#x27;s Democracies. These elections are generally regarded as rigged, and the Western powers recognized them as show elections. For the duration of the Cold War, the countries of Eastern Europe became Soviet satellite states — they were &quot;independent&quot; nations, which were one-party communist states whose General Secretary had to be approved by the Kremlin, and so their governments usually kept their policy in line with the wishes of the Soviet Union, although nationalistic forces and pressures within the satellite states played a part in causing some deviation from strict Soviet rule.

===Tenor of Soviet–U.S. relations===
The USSR urgently needed munitions, food and fuel that was provided by the U.S. and also Britain, primarily through Lend Lease. The three powers kept in regular contact, with Stalin trying to maintain a veil of secrecy over internal affairs. Churchill and other top Soviets visited Moscow, as did Roosevelt&#x27;s top aide Harry Hopkins. Stalin repeatedly requested that the United States and Britain open a second front on Continental Europe; but the Allied invasion did not occur until June 1944, more than two years later. In the meantime, the Russians suffered high casualties, and the Soviets faced the brunt of German strength. The Allies pointed out that their intensive air bombardment was a major factor that Stalin ignored.

=== Korean War ===

In 1950, the Soviet Union protested against the fact that the Chinese seat at the United Nations Security Council was held by the Nationalist government of China, and boycotted the meetings. While the Soviet Union was absent, the UN passed 
a resolution condemning North Korean actions and eventually offered military support to South Korea. After this incident the Soviet Union was never absent at the meetings of the Security Council.

==Domestic events==
===Censorship===

Art and science were subjected to rigorous censorship under Stalin&#x27;s direct oversight. Where previously The All- Russian Union of Writers (AUW) had attempted to publish apolitical writing, The Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (RAPP) insisted on the importance of politics in literary work, and published content which primarily embodied the hegemony of the working-class values in fiction. In 1925, The RAPP launched a campaign against the AUW chairman Yevgeny Zamyatin. It resulted in the defeat of the AUW, and they were replaced by the All-Russian Union of Soviet Writers, which strictly adopted the literary style of socialist realism. Soviet biology studies were heavily influenced by the now-discredited biologist Trofim Lysenko, who rejected the concept of Mendelian inheritance in favor of a form of Lamarckism. In physics, the theory of relativity was dismissed as &quot;bourgeois idealism&quot;. Much of this censorship was the work of Andrei Zhdanov, known as Stalin&#x27;s &quot;ideological hatchet man&quot;, until his death from a heart attack in 1948.

Stalin&#x27;s cult of personality reached its height in the postwar period, with his picture displayed in every school, factory, and government office, yet he rarely appeared in public. Postwar reconstruction proceeded rapidly, but as the emphasis was all on heavy industry and energy, living standards remained low, especially outside of the major cities.

=== Post-war period ===
The mild political liberalization that took place in the Soviet Union during the war quickly came to an end in 1945. The Orthodox Church was generally left unmolested after the war and was even allowed to print small amounts of religious literature, but persecution of minority religions was resumed.

Stalin and the Communist Party were given full credit for the victory over Germany, and generals such as Zhukov were demoted to regional commands (Ukraine in his case). With the onset of the Cold War, anti-Western propaganda was stepped up, with the capitalist world depicted as a decadent place where crime, unemployment, and poverty were rampant.

The late Stalinist period saw the emergence of a tacit &quot;big deal&quot; between the state and the Soviet &quot;nomenklatura&quot; and the experts whose status corresponded to that of the Western middle class under which the state would accept &quot;bourgeois&quot; habits such as a degree of consumerism, romance, and domesticity in exchange for the unflinching loyalty of the &quot;nomenklatura&quot; to the state. The informal &quot;big deal&quot; was a result of World War Two as many of the Soviet middle classes expected a higher standard of living after the war in exchange for accepting wartime sacrifices, and as the Soviet system could not function with the necessary technical experts and the &quot;nomenklatura&quot;, the state needed the services of such people, leading to the informal &quot;big deal&quot;. Furthermore, during the war, the state had to a certain extent relaxed its control and allowed informal practices to exist that usually contravened the rules. After 1945, this loosening of social control was never completely undone as instead the state sought to co-opt the certain elements of the population, allowing certain rules to be contravened provided that the populace remained overall loyal. One result of the &quot;big deal&quot; was a rise in materialism, corruption and nepotism that continued to color daily life in the Soviet Union for the rest of its existence. Another example of the &quot;big deal&quot; was the publication starting in the late 1940s of a series of romance novels aimed at a female audience; a choice of subject matter that would have been unthinkable before the war.

In particular, the late 1940s saw the rise of the &quot;vory v zakone&quot; (&quot;thieves in law&quot;) as Russian organised crime is known who form a very distinctive subculture complete with their own dialect of Russian. Despite their name, the &quot;vory v zakone&quot; are not just thieves, but engage in the entire gamut of criminal activities. The &quot;vory v zakone&quot; did well as blackmarketers in a post-war society that suffered from a shortage of basic goods. The crime wave that gripped the Soviet Union in the late 1940s was the source of much public disquiet at the time. A particular source of worry was the rise of juvenile crime with one police study from 1947 showing that 69% of all crimes were committed by teenagers under the age of 16. Most of the juvenile criminals were orphans from the war living on the streets who turned to crime as the only way to survive. Most of the complaints about juvenile crime concerned street children working as prostitutes, thieves or hiring their services out to the &quot;vory v zakone&quot;. Various economic reforms like Monetary reform of 1947 were undertaken in order to stabilize post-war economy and suppress illegal trade.

The Great Patriotic War despite the immense sufferings and losses, thanks to propaganda, came to be looked backed nostalgically as a time of excitement, adventure, danger, and national solidarity while life in the post-war era was seen as dull, stagnant, mundane and as a time when people put their own individual interests ahead of the greater good. There was a widespread feeling that though the war had been won, the peace had been lost as the wartime expectations and hopes for a better world after the war were dashed. The post-war era saw the emergences of various subcultures that usually in some way deviated from what was officially ascribed (for an example listening to smuggled records of Western pop music), and depending upon the nature of the subcultures were either tolerated by the authorities or cracked down upon. Another post-war social trend was the emergence of greater individualism and a search for privacy as the demand grew for private apartments while those in urban areas sought to spend more time in the countryside, where the state had less control over daily life. For members of the &quot;nomenklatura&quot;, the ultimate status symbol came to be the dacha in the countryside where the &quot;nomenklatura&quot; and their families could enjoy themselves far from prying eyes. Others sought their own personal space by devoting themselves to apolitical pursuits such as the hard sciences or by moving to a remote region such as Siberia where the state had less control. Informal networks of friends and relatives known as &quot;svoi&quot; (&quot;one&#x27;s own&quot;) emerged that functioned as self-help societies, and often became crucial to determining one&#x27;s social success as the membership of the right &quot;svoi&quot; could improve the odds of one&#x27;s children attending a prestigious university or allow one to obtain basic goods in short supply such as toilet paper. Another example of the social trend towards a greater personal spaces for ordinary people was the rise in popularity of underground poetry and of the &quot;samizdat&quot; literature that criticized the Soviet system.

Despite the best efforts of the authorities, many young people in the late 1940s liked to listen to the Russian language broadcasts of the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), leading to a major campaign launched in 1948 intended to discredit both radio stations as &quot;capitalist propaganda&quot;. Likewise, the journals &quot;Amerika&quot; (&quot;America&quot;) and &quot;Britanskii Soiuznik&quot; (&quot;British Ally&quot;) published by the American and British governments were very popular with young people in the late 1940s, selling out within minutes of appearing on kiosks in Moscow and Leningrad (modern St. Petersburg). The German historian Juliane Fürst has cautioned the interest of young people in the Anglo-American culture was not necessarily a rejection of the Soviet system, but instead reflected mere curiosity about the world beyond the Soviet Union. Fürst wrote that many young people in the late 1940s-early 1950s displayed ambivalent attitudes, being on one hand convinced that their nation was the world&#x27;s greatest and most progressive nation while at the same time displaying a certain nagging self-doubt and a belief that just might be something better out there. The way that Russian nationalism had merged with Communism during the Great Patriotic War to create a new Soviet identity based equally upon pride in being Russian and being Communist allowed the authorities to cast criticism of the Soviet system as &quot;unpatriotic&quot;, which for the time seemed to rebuff the elements of self-doubt that were residing with certain segments of the people.

Another sign of a growing search for a personal space of one&#x27;s own after 1945 were the popularity of apolitical films such as musicals, comedies and romances over the more political films that glorified Communism. The late 1940s were a time of what the Hungarian historian Peter Kenz called the &quot;film hunger&quot; as the Soviet film industry could not release enough films owing to the problems posed by post war reconstruction, and so as a result Soviet cinemas showed American and German films captured by the Red Army in the eastern parts of Germany and in Eastern Europe, known in the Soviet Union as &quot;trophy films&quot;. Much to the worry of the authorities, American films such as &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot;, &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, and &quot;Sun Valley&quot; proved to be extremely popular with Soviet audiences. The most popular of all the foreign films were the 1941 German-Hungarian romantic musical film &quot;The Girl of My Dreams&quot;, which was released in the Soviet Union in 1947, and the 1941 American film &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s New York Adventures&quot;, which was released in the Soviet Union in 1951. The musician Bulat Okudzhava recalled: &quot;It was the one and only thing in Tbilisi for which everyone went out of their minds, the trophy film, &quot;The Girl of My Dreams&quot;, with the extraordinary and indescribable Marika Rökk in the main role. Normal life stopped in the city. Everyone talked about the film, they ran to see it whenever they had a chance, in the streets people whistled melodies from it, from half-open windows you hear people playing tunes from it on the piano&quot;.

As early as the late 1940s, the Austrian scholar Franz Borkenau contended that the Soviet government was not a monolithic totalitarian machine, but instead divided into vast &quot;chefstvo&quot; (patronage) networks extending down from the elite to the lowest ranks of power with Stalin more as the ultimate arbiter of the various factions instead of being the leader of a &quot;1984&quot; type state. Borkenau&#x27;s techniques were a minute analysis of official Soviet statements and the relative placement of various officials at the Kremlin on festive occasions to determine which Soviet official enjoyed Stalin&#x27;s favour and which official did not. Signs such as newspaper editorials, guest lists at formal occasions, obituaries in Soviet newspapers, and accounts of formal speeches were important to identifying the various &quot;chefstvo&quot; networks. Borkenau argued that even small changes in the formalistic language of the Soviet state could sometimes indicate important changes: &quot;Political issues must be interpreted in the light of formulas, political and otherwise, and their history; and such interpretation cannot be safely concluded until the whole history of the given formula has been established from its first enunciation on&quot;.

Terror by the secret police continued in the postwar period. Although nothing comparable to 1937 ever happened again, there were many smaller purges, including a mass purge of the Georgian Communist Party apparatus in 1951–52. Starting in 1949, the principle enemy of the state came to be portrayed as the &quot;rootless cosmopolitans&quot;, a term that was never precisely defined. The term &quot;rootless cosmopolitan&quot; in practice was used to attack intellectuals, Jews and frequently both. Stalin&#x27;s health also deteriorated precipitously after WWII. He suffered a stroke in the fall of 1945 and was ill for months. This was followed by another stroke in 1947. Stalin became less active in the day-to-day running of the state and instead of party meetings, preferred to invite the Politburo members to all-night dinners where he would watch movies and force them to get drunk and embarrass themselves or say something incriminating.

In October 1952, the first postwar party congress convened in Moscow. Stalin did not feel up to delivering the main report and for most of the proceedings sat in silence while Nikita Khrushchev and Georgy Malenkov delivered the main speeches. He did suggest however that the party be renamed from &quot;The All-Union Party of Bolsheviks&quot; to &quot;The Communist Party of the Soviet Union&quot; on the grounds that &quot;There was once a time when it was necessary to distinguish ourselves from the Mensheviks, but there are no Mensheviks anymore. We are the entire party now.&quot; Stalin also mentioned his advancing age (two months away from 73) and suggested that it might be time to retire. Predictably, no one at the congress would dare agree with it and the delegates instead pleaded for him to stay.

=== Post Stalin&#x27;s death ===
On 1 March 1953, Stalin&#x27;s staff found him semi-conscious on the bedroom floor of his Volynskoe dacha. He had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. Stalin died on 5 March 1953. An autopsy revealed that he had died of a cerebral hemorrhage and that he also suffered from severe damage to his cerebral arteries due to atherosclerosis. It is possible that Stalin was murdered. Beria has been suspected of murder, although no firm evidence has ever appeared.

Stalin left no anointed successor nor a framework within which a transfer of power could take place. The Central Committee met on the day of his death, with Malenkov, Beria, and Khrushchev emerging as the party&#x27;s key figures. The system of collective leadership was restored, and measures introduced to prevent any one member attaining autocratic domination again. The collective leadership included the following eight senior members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union listed according to the order of precedence presented formally on 5 March 1953: Georgy Malenkov, Lavrentiy Beria, Vyacheslav Molotov, Kliment Voroshilov, Nikita Khrushchev, Nikolai Bulganin, Lazar Kaganovich and Anastas Mikoyan. Reforms to the Soviet system were immediately implemented. Economic reform scaled back the mass construction projects, placed a new emphasis on house building, and eased the levels of taxation on the peasantry to stimulate production. The new leaders sought rapprochement with the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and a less hostile relationship with the United States, pursuing a negotiated end to the Korean War in July 1953. The doctors who had been imprisoned were released and the anti-Semitic purges ceased. A mass amnesty of 1953 for certain categories of imprisoned was issued, halving the country&#x27;s inmate population, while the state security and Gulag systems were reformed, with torture being banned in April 1953.

<text>The Atom is a name shared by five superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.

The original Golden Age Atom, Al Pratt, was created by writer Bill O&#x27;Connor and artist Ben Flinton and first appeared in All-American Publications&#x27; &quot;All-American Comics&quot; #19 (October 1940). The second Atom was the Silver Age Atom, Ray Palmer, who first appeared in 1961. The third Atom, Adam Cray, was a minor character present in Suicide Squad stories. The fourth Atom, Ryan Choi, debuted in a new &quot;Atom&quot; series in August 2006. Another Atom from the 853rd Century first appeared as part of Justice Legion Alpha in August 1999.

The Atom has been the star of multiple solo series, and four of the five have appeared as members of various superhero teams, such as the Justice Society of America, the Justice League, the Suicide Squad, and the Justice Legion Alpha.

==Fictional character biographies==

===Al Pratt===
The original Atom, Al Pratt, first appeared in &quot;All-American Comics&quot; #19 (October 1940). He initially had no superpowers; instead, he was a diminutive college student and later a physicist who was depicted as a tough guy, a symbol of all the short kids who could still make a difference. Pratt was a founding member of the Justice Society of America, later gaining limited super-strength, and an energy charged &#x27;atomic punch&#x27;. He died in the charge against Extant during the Zero Hour.

===Ray Palmer===

The Atom introduced during the Silver Age of comic books in &quot;Showcase&quot; #34 (1961) is physicist and university professor Raymond Palmer, Ph.D. (He was named for real-life science fiction writer Raymond A. Palmer, who was himself quite short.) After stumbling onto a mass of white dwarf star matter that had fallen to Earth, he fashioned a lens which allowed him to shrink down to subatomic size. Originally, his size and molecular density abilities derived from the white dwarf star material of his costume, controlled by mechanisms in his belt, and later by controls in the palms of his gloves. Much later, he gained the innate equivalent powers within his own body. After the events of &quot;Identity Crisis,&quot; Ray shrank himself to microscopic size and disappeared. Finding him became a major theme of the Countdown year-long series and crossover event.

===Paul Hoben===
Prior to Ray Palmer&#x27;s trip to the Amazon Jungle, he learns his wife Jean Loring has had an affair with her colleague, Paul Hoben. Palmer and Loring got a divorce. Later, Palmer offers his blessing to the couple when they marry, and he offers Hoben his size-changing belt so that Hoben can protect Ivy Town after Ray returns to the Morlaidhans. Adam Cray would later steal this belt; Hoben never uses the costume or name of the Atom.

===Adam Cray===

Adam Cray, son of the murdered Senator Joseph Cray, first appeared as the Atom in the pages of &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; #44 by John Ostrander (August 1990). Cray was initially believed to be Ray Palmer in disguise by members of the team. Cray had been recruited by Palmer (who faked his own death) to apprehend the Micro Squad, a group of villains that had been reduced in size. Palmer intended to use Cray to uncover a shadowy government cabal which was using Palmer to discover the secret identities of other costumed heroes (Palmer&#x27;s own identity no longer being secret). While Palmer infiltrated the Micro Squad, Cray would attract the attention of the Cabal as the new Atom so that no one would notice Palmer assuming the identity of a fallen Micro Squad member.

Adam Cray remained with the Suicide Squad briefly, serving as a secret weapon whose existence was unknown to others of the Squad. Cray saves Amanda Waller from a group of assassins. At one point, Cray approaches Deadshot about his role in Senator Cray&#x27;s murder. Later, Cray is impaled through the chest with a screw by Blacksnake, a Micro Squad member who believes him to be Palmer.

After the unanticipated murder of Cray, Palmer reveals himself and defeats Cray&#x27;s murderer. The ruse ended, Palmer explains himself to the Justice League, who had been searching for him after hearing rumors of a new Atom.

During the events of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Adam&#x27;s corpse is reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps alongside several other fallen Suicide Squad members. Following his reanimation, Adam and the other Black Lanterns travel to Belle Reve and attack Bane and Black Alice. Adam is apparently destroyed by the Manhunter&#x27;s self-destruct mechanism, unleashing an explosion of Green Lantern energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns.

In DC Rebirth, Adam Cray is the son of Senator Cray and Ryan Choi&#x27;s roommate at Ivy University. Senator Cray also attended Ivy and expected Adam to attend Ivy as well. He first meets Ryan when he walks into their dorm with heavy luggage and kindly introduces himself. Adam teaches Ryan how to play rugby and video games.

===Ryan Choi===

Ryan Choi, as described by DC solicitations, is &quot;a young hotshot professor who&#x27;s filling the extra spot on Ivy University&#x27;s teaching staff. .. and who inadvertently ends up filling the old Atom&#x27;s super-heroic shoes&quot;. This new Atom is based on a redesign by Grant Morrison. He debuted in the &quot;Brave New World&quot; one-shot, a preview of projects, and then appeared in the series &quot;The All-New Atom&quot;, written by Gail Simone. He is later murdered by Deathstroke and his Titans.

=== Rhonda Piñeda/Atomica===
In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, a new, female Atom is introduced, Rhonda Piñeda, a Hispanic American college student from Ivy Town. She is revealed to be working as a reluctant spy for Amanda Waller and Steve Trevor, gathering intel on the new Justice League recruits. She is noted to be &quot;the most important member of the Justice League of America&quot; by Steve Trevor. At the conclusion of the &quot;Trinity War&quot; storyline, she is revealed to in fact be betraying both teams; she hails from the alternate universe of Earth-3, where she is a member of the Crime Syndicate operating under the name Atomica. She also reveals that by placing a sliver of Green Kryptonite in Superman&#x27;s optic nerve, she caused him to accidentally kill Doctor Light, with the added effect of severely weakening and almost killing Superman over time.

Atomica originally worked on Earth-3 with Jonathan Allen / Johnny Quick as a thief and killer. One night after killing two cops, they are cornered on the roof of S.T.A.R. Labs during a storm. Lightning hits a satellite, electrocuting Johnny and granting him speed powers. Rhonda falls inside the building and lands near Ray Palmer&#x27;s Atomico work, gaining size- and density-changing powers. During the final battle with the Crime Syndicate, Atomica reduces her size and is killed when Lex Luthor steps on her.

Following the reboot of the multiverse after &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot;, a new Earth 3 and Atomica are created. Atomica is the lover of speedster serial killer Jonathan Chambers / Johnny Quick and accompanies him on his high-speed murder spree across Central City.

===Atom One Million===
An unnamed scientist in the 853rd Century performed experiments in superstring theory that creates a singularity and whose radiation alters his physical make-up. When the singularity threatened to expand and destroy his universe, he enters it in an attempt to save the universe but instead finds himself on an interdimensional bridge to another universe as his own is wiped out, unable to stop it. At the end of the bridge, he finds Superman Prime who came to help but was too late. Stranded, he searches this universe for remnants of the one he lost, in time taking the name the Atom and joining the Justice Legion Alpha when he helped them defeat the Bizarro-Legion. This Atom&#x27;s powers differ from his predecessors in that he doesn&#x27;t shrink but breaks up into several smaller duplicates of himself divided amongst his mass. At atomic size, these duplicates can mimic elements such as gold and oxygen.

==Other versions==
===The Dark Knight Strikes Again===
Frank Miller portrayed Ray Palmer as a major player in &quot;&quot; as part of Batman&#x27;s resistance. He was taken prisoner by Lex Luthor and made to live in one of his own petri dishes for a period of months until his rescue by Catgirl. in &quot;Dark Knight III&quot;, He was then instrumental in the liberation of Kandor until killed by their leader, Baal.

===Tangent Comics===

In the Tangent Comics imprint, the Atom is &quot;Arthur Harrison Thompson&quot;, a subject of radiation testing on human beings. The first hero in the Tangent timeline, he inadvertently caused the Cuban Missile Crisis to escalate into a limited nuclear exchange that obliterated Florida and Cuba in 1962, unknown to his fellow Americans. Thompson was succeeded by his son, who was killed by the Tangent Comics version of the Fatal Five, and a grandson named Adam, who, in &quot;Tangent: Superman&#x27;s Reign&quot;, is being held captive by Superman.

It is suggested in the Tangent series that the Atom&#x27;s name was at least in part chosen because of the abbreviation of his full name &quot;Arthur Harrison Thompson&quot; on his barracks door to simply &quot;A. Thom.&quot;

Also in the Tangent series, the Atom&#x27;s presence as America&#x27;s first superhero during the 1960s has led to a huge cultural impact, and in this world many significant points in pop culture have been effected by his presence; for instance The Beatles choose to be called &quot;The Atomiks&quot;, further more TV shows such as &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; became &quot;The Superman Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; became &quot;The Dick Van Hero Show&quot; and &quot;Get Smart&quot; became &quot;Get Powers&quot;.

===Elseworlds===

*Some other re-imaginings of the Atom include an appearance in &quot;League of Justice&quot;, a story portraying the Justice League in a &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;-type story where the Atom was recast as a wizard/fortune teller called &quot;Atomus The Palmer&quot;.
*Al Pratt as the Atom was one of the three heroes who chose to work at the side of Senator Thompson in &quot;The Golden Age&quot;. When Al discovers that Thompson is really the Ultra-Humanite, he joins the other heroes against the villain and Dyna-Man.
*The Al Pratt Atom appeared in &quot;&quot; as a post-WW2 intelligence agent with transparent atomic flesh and a visible skeleton.
*&quot;&quot; where Ray Palmer worked with a science consortium whose numbers at one point included Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla.
*&quot;&quot;, after Ray Palmer is killed in the cosmic storm that nearly wipes out the rest of the male population on Earth, a graduate student named Jill Athron is given a research grant to study Palmer&#x27;s white-dwarf-star-belt. She becomes the Atom and joins the Justice League.
* The Robin in the &quot;Just Imagine...&quot; is granted transformation into the Atom evolved from an Incan rune of Hawkman.

===52 Multiverse===
In the final issue of &quot;52&quot;, a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated &quot;Earth-2&quot;. As a result of Mister Mind &quot;eating&quot; aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-2, including the Atom among other Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Atom is visually similar to the Al Pratt Atom. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-2.

In &quot;Countdown&quot; #30, the Challengers from Beyond encountered Earth-15, a world where the sidekicks had taken their mentor&#x27;s places. On this Earth, the Atom is Jessica Palmer, a genius who graduated from MIT at age eight. &quot;The Search for Ray Palmer - Red Son&quot; features the Ray Palmer of Earth-30, an American captured by the . &quot;&quot; also depicts the Ray Palmer of Earth-6, who through unknown circumstances now has the powers and title of the Ray. &quot;The Search For Ray Palmer: Superwoman/Batwoman&quot; briefly features a female version of The Atom.
On the newly introduced Earth-52, Atomarsupial is one of the metasimian Primate Legion

<doc id="465979" wikidata="Q697295" url="?curid=465979" title="Shrine">
<text>A shrine ( &quot;case or chest for books or papers&quot;; Old French: &quot;escrin&quot; &quot;box or case&quot;) is a sacred space dedicated to a specific deity, ancestor, hero, martyr, saint, daemon, or similar figure of respect, wherein they are venerated or worshipped. Shrines often contain idols, relics, or other such objects associated with the figure being venerated. A shrine at which votive offerings are made is called an altar. 

Shrines are found in many of the world&#x27;s religions, including Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Chinese folk religion, Shinto, indigenous Philippine folk religions, and Germanic paganism as well as in secular and non-religious settings such as a war memorial. Shrines can be found in various settings, such as churches, temples, cemeteries, or as household shrines. Portable shrines are also found in some cultures.

==Types of shrines==
===Temple shrines===
Many shrines are located within buildings and in the temples designed specifically for worship, such as a church in Christianity, or a mandir in Hinduism. A shrine here is usually the center of attention in the building and is given a place of prominence. In such cases, adherents of the faith assemble within the building in order to venerate the deity at the shrine. In classical temple architecture, the shrine may be synonymous with the cella.

===Household shrines===
Historically, in Hinduism, Buddhism and Roman Catholicism, and also in modern faiths, such as Neopaganism, a shrine can commonly be found within the home or shop. This shrine is usually a small structure or a setup of pictures and figurines dedicated to a deity that is part of the official religion, to ancestors or to a localised household deity.

===Yard shrines===
Small outdoor yard shrines are found at the bottom of many peoples&#x27; gardens, following various religions, including historically, Balinese Hinduism, Christianity. Many consist of a statue of Christ, Virgin Mary or a saint, on a pedestal or in an alcove, while others may be elaborate booths without ceilings, some include paintings, statuary, and architectural elements, such as walls, roofs, glass doors and ironwork fences.

In the United States, some Christians have small yard shrines; some of these resemble side altars, since they are composed of a statue placed in a niche or grotto; this type is colloquially referred to as a &quot;bathtub madonna&quot;.

===Wayside shrines ===

Religious images, usually in some sort of small shelter, placed by a road or pathway, sometimes in a settlement or at a crossroads.

==Religious shrines==

Shrines are found in many religions. As distinguished from a temple, a shrine usually houses a particular relic or cult image, which is the object of worship or veneration. A shrine may also be constructed to set apart a site which is thought to be particularly holy, as opposed to being placed for the convenience of worshipers. Shrines therefore attract the practice of pilgrimage.

===Christianity===
Shrines are found in many forms of Christianity, but not all. Catholicism, the largest denomination of Christianity, has many shrines, as do Orthodox Christianity, Anglicanism and some forms of Lutheranism.

In the Roman Catholic Church, a local diocesan bishop or archbishop can designate a local (arch)diocesan shrine. For a shrine to be a national shrine, the approval of the country&#x27;s Episcopal Conference is required. Similarly, the approval of the Holy See at the Vatican in Rome is required for it to be &quot;international. The Roman Catholic 1983 Code of Canon Law, canons 1230 and 1231 read: &quot;The term shrine means a church or other sacred place which, with the approval of the local Ordinary, is by reason of special devotion frequented by the faithful as pilgrims. For a shrine to be described as national, the approval of the Episcopal Conference is necessary. For it to be described as international, the approval of the Holy See is required.&quot;
In unofficial, colloquial Catholic use, the term &quot;shrine&quot; is a niche or alcove in churches, especially larger ones, used by parishioners when praying privately. They were formerly also called devotional altars, since before the Second Vatican Council they contained small side altars or bye-altars. Shrines are always centered on some image (for instance, a statue, painting, mural or mosaic) of Jesus Christ, of Mary, mother of Jesus, or of a saint, and may have had a reredos behind them.

Today, Mass would not necessarily be celebrated at them. They are simply used to aid or give a visual focus for prayers. Side altars, where Mass could actually be celebrated, were used in a similar way to shrines by parishioners. Side altars are specifically dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus, to her husband Saint Joseph, or to other saints.

A nativity scene could also be viewed as a shrine, as the definition of a shrine is any holy or sacred place.

=== Islam ===
 Islam&#x27;s holiest structure, the &quot;Kaaba&quot; (within the Al-Haram Mosque) in the city of Mecca, though an ancient temple (in the sense of a &quot;house of God&quot;), may be seen as a shrine due to it housing a respected relic called the &quot;Hajar al-Aswad&quot; and also being the partial focus of the world&#x27;s largest pilgrimage practice, the Hajj. A few yards away, the mosque also houses the &quot;Maqam Ibrahim&quot; (&quot;Abraham&#x27;s station&quot;) shrine containing a petrosomatoglyph (of feet) associated with the patriarch and his son Ishmael&#x27;s building of the Kaaba in Islamic tradition. The Green Dome sepulcher of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (where his burial chamber also contains the tombs of his friend Abu Bakr and close companion Umar) in Medina, housed in the Masjid an-Nabawi (&quot;The Mosque of the Prophet&quot;), occurs as a greatly venerated place and important as a site of pilgrimage among Muslims.

==== Sunni Islam ====
Two of the oldest and notable Islamic shrines are the Dome of the Rock and the smaller Dome of the Chain built on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. The former was built over the rock that marked the site of the Jewish Temple and according to Islamic tradition, was the point of departure of Muhammad&#x27;s legendary ascent heavenwards (&quot;al-Mi&#x27;raj&quot;).

More than any other shrines in the Muslim world, the tomb of Muhammad is considered a source of blessings for the visitor. Among sayings attributed to Muhammad include one stated as: &quot;He who visits my grave will be entitled to my intercession.&quot; Visiting Muhammad&#x27;s tomb after the pilgrimage is considered by the majority of Sunni legal scholars to be recommended.

The early scholars of the &quot;salaf&quot;, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d. 241 AH), Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh (d. 238 SH), Abdullah ibn Mubarak (d. 189 AH) and Imam Shafi&#x27;i (d. 204 AH) all permitted the practice of &quot;ziyāra&quot; to Muhammad&#x27;s tomb. The &quot;hadith&quot; scholar Qadi Ayyad (d. 554 AH) stated that visiting Muhammad was &quot;a Sunna of the Muslims on which there was consensus, and a good and desirable deed.&quot;

Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d. 852 AH) explicitly stated that travelling to visit the tomb of Muhammad was &quot;one of the best of actions and the noblest of pious deeds with which one draws near to God, and its legitimacy is a matter of consensus.&quot; Similarly, Ibn Qudamah (d. 620 AH) considered &quot;ziyāra&quot; of Muhammad to be recommended and also seeking intercession directly from Muhammad at his grave.

The tombs of other Muslim religious figures are also respected. The son of Ahmad ibn Hanbal, one of the primary jurists of Sunnism, reportedly stated that he would prefer to be buried near the mausoleum of a saintly person than his own father. While in some parts of the Muslim world the mausoleums of the tombs are seen as simply places of &quot;ziyāra&quot; of a religious figure&#x27;s gravesite (&quot;Mazār&quot;/), in others (such as the Indian subcontinent) they are treated as proper shrines (&quot;Dargah&quot;).

===== Opposition to tomb shrines by the Salafi and Wahhabi groups =====
Many modern Islamic reformers oppose the building (and sometimes the visitation of) tomb shrines, viewing it as a deviation from true Islam. This mainly includes followers of the Wahhabi and Salafi movements, which believe that shrines over graves encourage idolatry/polytheism (&quot;shirk&quot;) and that there is a risk of worshipping other than God (the dead).

The founder of the Wahhabi movement, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab derived the prohibition to build mosques over graves from a &quot;hadith&quot; attributed to the Muhammad in which he said &quot;May God curse the Jews and Christians who make the graves of their prophets into places of worship; do not imitate them.&quot; Additionally, he commanded leveling of the graves (&quot;taswiyat al-qubur&quot;), which the scholar Imam Al-Shafi&#x27;i supported.

The Wahhabi movement was heavily influenced by the works of the medieval Hanbali theologian Ibn Taymiyyah who was considered by them to be the &quot;ultimate authority on a great number of issues&quot;. One of these issues was the position on the visitation of Muhammad&#x27;s tomb. According to Ibn Taymiyyah all the &quot;ahadith&quot; encouraging the visitation of the tomb are fabricated (&quot;mawdu‘&quot;), are not contained in the six main collections of &quot;hadith&quot; or &quot;Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal&quot;, and violate &quot;tawhid al-uluhiya&quot;.

This view of Ibn Taymiyyah was rejected by some mainstream Sunni scholars both during his life and after his death. The Shafi&#x27;i hadith master Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani stated that &quot;This is one of the ugliest positions that has been reported of Ibn Taymiyya&quot;. The Hanafi hadith scholar Ali al-Qari stated that, &quot;Amongst the Hanbalis, Ibn Taymiyya has gone to an extreme by prohibiting travelling to visit the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace&quot; Qastallani stated that &quot;The Shaykh Taqi al-Din Ibn Taymiyya has abominable and odd statements on this issue to the effect that travelling to visit the Prophet is prohibited and is not a pious deed.&quot; 
==== Shia ====
Shias have several mazars dedicated to various religious figures important in their history, and several elaborate shrines (&quot;Marqad&quot;/&quot;Maqam&quot;) are dedicated to Shia religious figures, most notably in Iraq (such as in the cities of Karbala, Najaf, Samarra) and in Iran (such as in the cities of Qom and Mashad).

Specific examples of Shia shrines include the Al-Askari Shrine, and Imam Hussein Shrine. Other Shia shrines are located in the eponymous cities of &quot;Mazar-e Sharif&quot; (&quot;The Noble Mausoleum&quot;) in Afghanistan, and &quot;Mashhad&quot; (&quot;al-Rida&quot;) (&quot;Martyrium [of Ali al-Rida ]&quot;) in Iran. The Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini in Tehran houses the tombs of Ruhollah Khomenei, the leader of Iran&#x27;s 1978–79 revolution, his wife, and a few other related people.
==== Sufi ====

In popular Sufism, one common practice is to visit or make pilgrimages to the tombs of saints, renowned scholars, and righteous people. This is a particularly common practice in the Indian subcontinent, where famous tombs include of saints such as Sayyid Ali Hamadani in Kulob, Tajikistan; Afāq Khoja, near Kashgar, China; Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sindh; Ali Hujwiri in Lahore, Pakistan; Bahauddin Zakariya in Multan Pakistan; Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer, India; Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi, India; and Shah Jalal in Sylhet, Bangladesh. Likewise, in Fez, Morocco, a popular destination for pious visitation is the Zaouia Moulay Idriss II. The area around Timbuktu in Mali also has many historic Sufi shrines which were destroyed by Islamist in recent years. Many of these have since been rebuilt. A saint&#x27;s tomb is a site of great veneration where blessings or baraka continue to reach the deceased holy person and are deemed (by some) to benefit visiting devotees and pilgrims according to Sufi beliefs. In order to show reverence to Sufi saints, kings, and nobles provided large donations or waqf to preserve the tombs and renovate them architecturally. Over time, these donation, rituals, annual commemorations formed into an elaborate system of accepted norms. These forms of Sufi practise created an aura of spiritual and religious traditions around prescribed dates. Many orthodox or Islamic purists denounce these visiting grave rituals, especially the expectation of receiving blessings from the venerated saints.
=== Baháʼí Faith===

The two most well-known Baháʼí Faith shrines serve as the resting places for the respective remains of the two central figures of the Baháʼí Faith, the Báb and Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh. They are the focal points of a Baháʼí pilgrimage:
* The Shrine of the Báb in Haifa, Israel.
* The Shrine of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh in Acre, Israel.
Other sites have been designated as Baháʼí Shrines, the most notable being the home of William Sutherland Maxwell and May Maxwell in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
===Buddhism===
In Buddhism, a shrine refers to a place where veneration is focused on Lord Buddha or one of the bodhisattvas or arahants. Monks, nuns and laity will pay homage with the aide of Buddhist iconography at these shrines which are also used for Buddhist meditation.

Typically, Buddhist shrines contain a statue of either Gautama Buddha, or (in the Mahayana and Vajrayana forms of Buddhism), one of the various Buddhas or bodhisattvas. They also commonly contain candles, along with offerings such as flowers, purified water, food, and incense. Many shrines also contain sacred relics, such as the famous sacred tooth of Lord Buddha installed at a shrine in Sri Lanka.

Site-specific shrines in Buddhism, particularly those that contain relics of past Buddhas and revered enlightened monks, are often designed in the traditional form known as the Stupa or Cetiya.

===Philippine folk religions===

Ancient Filipinos, and Filipinos today who continue to adhere to the indigenous Philippine folk religions generally do not have so-called &quot;temples&quot; of worship under the context known to foreign cultures. However, they do have sacred shrines, which are also called as spirit houses. They can range in size from small roofed platforms, to structures similar to a small house (but with no walls), to shrines that look similar to pagodas, especially in the south where early mosques were also modeled in the same way. These shrines were known in various indigenous terms, which depend on the ethnic group association. They can also be used as places to store &quot;taotao&quot; and caskets of ancestors. Among Bicolanos, &quot;taotao&quot; were also kept inside sacred caves called &quot;moog&quot;.

During certain ceremonies, &quot;anito&quot; are venerated through temporary altars near sacred places. These were called &quot;latangan&quot; or &quot;lantayan&quot; in Visayan and &quot;dambana&quot; or &quot;lambana&quot; in Tagalog. These bamboo or rattan altars are identical in basic construction throughout most of the Philippines. They were either small roof-less platforms or standing poles split at the tip (similar to a tiki torch). They held halved coconut shells, metal plates, or &quot;martaban&quot; jars as receptacles for offerings. &quot;Taotao&quot; may sometimes also be placed on these platforms.

Other types of sacred places or objects of worship of &quot;diwata&quot; include the material manifestation of their realms. The most widely venerated were &quot;balete&quot; trees (also called &quot;nonok&quot;, &quot;nunuk&quot;, &quot;nonoc&quot;, etc.) and anthills or termite mounds (&quot;punso&quot;). Other examples include mountains, waterfalls, tree groves, reefs, and caves.

===Germanic paganism===
In Germanic paganism, types of shrines were employed, but terms for the shrines show some level of ambiguity:
*&quot;Hörgrs&quot;, which may have originally exclusively referred to &quot;holy places&quot;, whereas its Old English cognate &quot;hearg&quot; could mean &quot;holy grove&quot; and/or &quot;temple, idol&quot;
*&quot;Vés&quot; (Old Norse) or &quot;wēohs&quot; (Old English), referring to either a types of shrines or sacred enclosures. The term appears in skaldic poetry and in place names in Scandinavia (with the exception of Iceland), often in connection with a Norse deity or a geographic feature. The name of the Norse god Vé, refers to the practice.

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism, a shrine is a place where gods or goddesses are worshipped. Shrines are typically located inside a Hindu temple of various forms. Most Hindu families have a household shrine as well. For example, according to memoirs of Stephen Huyler of his visits to some Hindu homes, a part of home was dedicated to the household shrine. Here, image of a deity was placed and offered prayers, instead of visits to a temple. Among Tamil Hindu homes, according to Pintchman, a shrine in Kitchen is more common. If the family is wealthy, it may locate the household shrine in a separate room.

===Taoism===

The line between a temple and a shrine in Taoism is not fully defined; shrines are usually smaller versions of larger Taoist temples or small places in a home where a yin-yang emblem is placed among peaceful settings to encourage meditation and study of Taoist texts and principles. Taoists place less emphasis on formalized attendance but include ritualized worship than other Asian religions; formal temples and structures of worship came about in Taoism with the influence from Buddhism.

Frequent features of Taoist shrines include the same features as full temples, often including any or all of the following features: gardens, running water or fountains, small burning braziers or candles (with or without incense), and copies of Taoist texts such as the Tao Te Ching, Zhuangzi or other texts by Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu or other Taoist sages.
===Confucianism===

A number of Confucian temples and shrines exist across the sinophone world, it is a temple for the veneration of Confucius, great sages, eminent philosophers of Confucianism and also the Disciples of Confucius. These temples are known as &quot;Temples of Confucius&quot; (孔廟) or &quot;Temples of Literature&quot; (文廟). Unlike Taoist temples, Confucian temples usually do not installed the images of Confucius but the tablets. It is argued that the temple was to honour Confucius&#x27;s teachings, not Confucius himself. The temples consist of gardens and then a large pavilion where incense is burnt. The tablet or sometime an image of Confucius is usually placed in the main shrine.

Confucian shrines exist outside of China too, mainly in Japan, Korea and Vietnam. There are also quite a number of Confucian shrines in Taiwan like Tainan Confucian Temple and Taipei Confucius Temple, they are well-maintained by the government. However, many Taoist temples dedicated a shrine for the worship of Confucius or Wen Chang Di Jun (God of Literature).

==Secular shrines==
In some countries around the world, landmarks may be called &quot;historic shrines.&quot; Notable shrines of this type include:
* The Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, U.S.
* Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.
* Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, U.S.
* Shrine of Remembrance, a war memorial in Melbourne, Australia
* Shrine of Remembrance, a war memorial in Brisbane, Australia
* Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum in Moscow, Russia
* Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang, North Korea

Halls of fame also serve as shrines into which single or multiple individuals are inducted on the basis of their influence upon regions, cultures or disciplines. Busts or full-body statues are often erected and placed alongside each other in commemoration. This includes Halls of Fame that honor sports athletes, where an athlete&#x27;s entrance to the hall is commonly described as &quot;enshrinement&quot;.

By extension the term &quot;shrine&quot; has come to mean any place dedicated completely to a particular person or subject such as the Shrine of the Sun in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

<doc id="465985" wikidata="Q6979153" url="?curid=465985" title="RMT (trade union)">
<text>The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (commonly known as the RMT) is a British trade union covering the transport sector. Its current President is George Welch and its current General Secretary is Mick Lynch.

The RMT is one of Britain&#x27;s fastest growing trade unions. Membership rose under and following the leadership of Bob Crow, increasing from 57,000 in 2002 to almost 81,500 in 2019.

==History==
The RMT was formed in 1990 through a merger of the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) and the National Union of Seamen (NUS) to create a single transport industry trade union.
===Political activity===

The predecessor unions to the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Union of Seamen were founding members of the original Labour Representation Committee and after its creation the RMT became a prominent voice on the left of the Labour Party. In 2003 some Scottish branches of the RMT voted to donate some of their funds to the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) in protest against the policies of Tony Blair and New Labour, such as not renationalising the railways. This led the Labour Party to expel the union in early 2004 for breaching its rules.

The RMT announced in 2009 that it would be standing a slate of candidates in the 2009 European Parliament elections under the banner of No to EU – Yes to Democracy, a broad left-wing alter-globalisation coalition which aimed to offer an alternative to the pro-business policies of the UK Independence Party. The RMT then became a founding member of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC), a left wing political party which has contested the 2010 and 2015 general elections.

The RMT was in favour of the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union in the 2016 referendum on the subject. However, RMT members Sean Hoyle, Peter Pinkney, Paul McDonnell and John Reid signed a letter in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, voicing their opposition to the Electoral Commission choosing Leave.EU, Vote Leave or Grassroots Out as the official group advocating for British withdrawal in the referendum, saying that: We call on the commission not to give taxpayers&#x27; money to the Tory and Ukip-dominated Vote Leave, Leave.EU or Grassroots Out campaigns, or any amalgam of them ... We believe there are millions of trade unionists, young people, anti-austerity campaigners and working-class voters, whose opposition to the big business-dominated EU would not be represented by these organisations. ... We call on the Electoral Commission to recognise that a significant proportion of those who will vote against the EU do so because they support basic socialist policies of workers&#x27; rights, public ownership, and opposition to austerity and racism.

In July 2015, the RMT endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.

===London Underground===
The RMT represents most London Underground staff, as well as many other workers in the London public transport network. The RMT has had a number of disputes with Transport for London and private sector contractors Metronet and Tube Lines over pay, safety, pensions and job security on the Underground. These disputes have often resulted in industrial action, leading to periods of travel disruption in the capital over the last decade.

===2022 strike===

In May 2022, the union began balloting 40,000 members on a strike action that might be joined by the Transport Salaried Staffs&#x27; Association (TSSA). Both managers and operators would be affected. Rail insiders have accused the union leaders of balloting prematurely without negotiation. Of primary concern to the unions were the upcoming job cuts at Network Rail and a demand for pay rises to offset the cost of living. Coming out of the pandemic, fewer passengers are currently using railways, however. Rail minister Wendy Morton and rail companies have emphasised the need to modernise the sector and reduce its cost base.

Union members backed industrial action overwhelmingly, and 24-hour strikes were scheduled for 21, 23 and 25 June. Both the RMT and the TSSA warned of a level of disruption not experienced since the 1926 general strike. Rail companies began drawing up plans to prioritise freight delivery over passenger services in order to keep supermarkets stocked.

==Affiliations==
The RMT is affiliated to a number of political organisations and trade union confederations. In the United Kingdom and Ireland the RMT is affiliated with the Trades Union Congress, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Wales Trades Union Congress and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Internationally the RMT is affiliated to the European Transport Workers Federation and the International Transport Workers Federation, as well as the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Politically the RMT was affiliated with the left wing political party, the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC), which it co-founded, until it disaffiliated in 2022. The RMT is also affiliated to the Labour Representation Committee, a pressure group which aims to promote traditional socialist principles within the Labour Party.

The RMT has provided 23,000 trade union cases to the Railway Work, Life and Death Project. This data includes information on accidents and disabilities on thousands of members, from the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants and National Union of Railwaymen during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==RMT Credit Union==
RMT Credit Union Limited is a savings and loans co-operative established by the trade union for its members in 2004. It is a member of UKCreditUnions Limited, a national trade association representing smaller credit unions, steering groups and support organisations. The credit union is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the PRA. Ultimately, like the banks and building societies, members&#x27; savings are protected against business failure by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

<text>Raël (born Claude Maurice Marcel Vorilhon, 30 September 1946), sometimes referred to as [[Maitreya]] Raël or simply Rael, is a French journalist who founded and leads the Raëlian Movement, an international UFO religion.

Before becoming a religious leader, Raël, then known as Claude Vorilhon, worked as a sports-car journalist and test driver for his car-racing magazine, &quot;Autopop&quot;. Following a purported extraterrestrial encounter in December 1973, he formed the Raëlian Movement and changed his name to Raël. He later published several books, which detail the encounter with a being called Yahweh in 1973. He traveled the world to promote his books for over 30 years.

==Early life==
Vorilhon was born in Vichy, Allier, France. He was raised in Ambert in the home of his maternal grandmother, who was atheist. According to a documentary, his unknown father was Jewish and his mother a &quot;devout atheist&quot;. He attended a Catholic boarding school in Le Puy-en-Velay and caused a scandal by taking part in communion without being baptized. His parents withdrew him from the boarding school to put him in school in Ambert. He later advocated that Huguenot descendants receive reparations from the Church.

At age 15, Vorilhon ran away from boarding school and hitchhiked to Paris, where he spent three years playing music on the streets and in cafés and cabarets. He met with , the director of a national radio program (on Europe 1), who was scouting for young talent. Vorilhon signed a record contract and became a rising teen pop star on the radio. He took on a new identity, assuming the name Claude Celler, and released six singles, including a minor hit song, &quot;Le miel et la cannelle&quot; (&quot;Honey and Cinnamon&quot;). Vorilhon had a passion for the songs of Belgian singer Jacques Brel, and tried to imitate his singing style. He was saving up his money to buy a racing car, a dream he had since he was a young boy, but his prospects as a singer came to an abrupt end when Morisse killed himself in September 1970.

Vorilhon decided to work as a sports journalist to gain access to the world of car racing. He met Marie-Paul Cristini, a nurse. They moved to Clermont-Ferrand, where Vorilhon started his own publishing house. He created a sports car magazine, &quot;Autopop&quot;, whose first issue was released in May 1971. One of the tasks for his new startup was the position of testing new automobiles, which enabled him to enter the motor racing world.

==The Raëlian messages==

According to the book &quot;Le Livre qui dit la vérité&quot; (&quot;The Book That Tells the Truth&quot;), Vorilhon had an alien visitation on 13 December 1973. In a secluded area within a French volcanic crater, Vorilhon claimed to see a strong flashing light and saw &quot;something like a bell&quot; made of shiny metal coming out from the sky slowly without any noise. He felt happy to see it, as he knew it was an UFO, about seven meters in diameter. A trapdoor opened under the craft, and an extraterrestrial being came out of a craft. The extraterrestrial told him, in French, that he had come for the sole purpose of meeting with him. Raël said he was given a message by this alien and told that it was his mission to pass this message on to the people of Earth. According to Vorilhon, he claimed that the face of the extraterrestrial was &quot;full of love.&quot;

The book states that advanced human scientists from another planet with 25,000 years of scientific advances created all life on Earth through DNA manipulation. These scientists, Raël said, were originally called Elohim or &quot;those who came from the sky&quot;. He wrote that around 40 prophets in Earth&#x27;s history were sent by Elohim, but their messages were distorted by humans, largely because of the difference in the level of civilization between the advanced race and Earth&#x27;s primitive one.

Raël said he was given the mission to inform the world of humanity&#x27;s origins in anticipation of these extraterrestrials&#x27; return by building a residential embassy in neutral territory. He stated that certain mysteries were explained to him based on new interpretations of sacred texts such as the Bible. He claimed that, on 7 October 1975, he was contacted by one of the Elohim, who took him to another planet to meet Buddha, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. He stated that his second book, &quot;Les extra-terrestres m&#x27;ont emmené sur leur planète&quot; (&quot;Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet&quot;), relates the teaching he received from these people. In this book, Raël describes harmonious and peaceable beings free of money, sickness, and war.

In 1974, Raël decided to give up his automobile magazine, &quot;Autopop&quot;. That September, the last issue, number 34, was published. Raël then devoted himself to the task he said was given by his &quot;biological father&quot;, an extraterrestrial named Yahweh. Shortly after a first public conference, Raël founded MADECH, a group of people interested in helping him in his task, which later became the &quot;International Raëlian Movement&quot;.

==Marriages==
Raël has been married three times.

His first wife was Marie-Paul Cristini. Sociologist Susan J. Palmer said that Cristini, a nurse, diagnosed Raël as clinically depressed after he appeared at her doorstep in 1987, burnt out from the tasks he carried out within the movement.

Raël focused on spreading his message in Japan in the 1980s, and by 1987, he met Lisa Sunagawa. Sunagawa soon began accompanying Raël during his travels to Lima, Miami, Brazil, and Martinique. In the 1990 Radio Canada television documentary &quot;They&#x27;re Coming!&quot;, Raël is seen with four women, while Lisa, in slow motion, wears a pink tutu and holds hands with him.

Raël separated from Sunagawa sometime between 1990 and 1992. Around that time, Sophie de Niverville, whose mother and aunt were both Raëlians, was convinced of the authenticity of the messages. Sophie received a Raëlian baptism at age 15. When she turned 16, she married Raël at Montreal&#x27;s city hall. During a December 2001 interview with Palmer, Sophie spoke positively about Raël, despite their divorce the previous year; they continued to live together.

==Racing career==
In 1994, wealthy Japanese Raëlians rented a race car and showed it to Raël. They believed that if he raced it, it would generate publicity for the movement. Raël accepted the offer on the condition that the funding not come from member tithes or embassy funding. Funding for Raël&#x27;s races, which took place in the 1990s and early 2000s, came mostly from well-funded European and Japanese people. His best finishes included &quot;a 3rd place finish in GT1 in Lime Rock with the Mosler Raptor in 1997, and a 7th place finish at Watkins Glen with a Viper GTS R in a 1999 FIA GT race&quot;. Raël participated in the 1999 BFGoodrich Tires Trans-Am Series and the 2000 Speedvision GT Championship. According to Palmer, Raël announced in November 2001 that he intended to retire from professional auto racing. He said that he still enjoyed racing in the form of video games.

==Promoted technologies==
Raël believes humanity is slowly transitioning into a society where humans will not need to work or have jobs. This is due to human technological advancement and because humans &quot;are not made to work&quot;. He has stated that work is for machines, whereas humans are made to create, think, and enrich themselves.

Much of Raël&#x27;s advocacy concerning futuristic technology is described in his 2001 book, &quot;Yes to Human Cloning&quot;. He supported human genetic engineering in order to avoid genetically inherited diseases and to reduce the economic burden on society. He said that no distinctive emphasis needed to be allocated to a particular race or religion. Elsewhere in the book, he stated that nanotechnology will make it possible to have micro-distributive power generation (essentially a power plant in each house), fur-like furnishings that are self-cleaning with hair-like fibers that move on their own, and biological robots. Nanostructures control biology, so Raël expected that meat and salads will someday be grown in a machine via molecular construction.

Raël believed that genetically modified food is the only way to stop hunger everywhere in the world, and he saw a future where qualities of different foods can be combined through direct genetic modification. In Raël&#x27;s book, &quot;Extraterrestrials took me to their planet&quot; (book number 2 in the volume &quot;Intelligent Design&quot;), he said that animation of plant life was possible through nanotechnology and that he was presented genetically modified flowers, that swayed and changed colors with music, while on another planet.

==Criticism and controversies==

===Plagiarism===
In recent years, many ex-Raëlians have accused Vorilhon of plagiarism. They have compared numerous passages from his books with those of author Jean Sendy. Raëlian concepts such as chemical education, infinity, geniocracy, and others are all found in Sendy&#x27;s books. Most of Raël&#x27;s book &quot;Sensual Meditation&quot; is said to have been derived from the Silva &#x27;Mind Control&#x27; Method, which was allegedly taught to him by ex-level-5 guide of the Canadian Raelian Movement, Jean-Denis Saint-Cyr.

In her book &quot;Raël, Thief of Souls: Biography of a Liar&quot; (), Maryse Péloquin provides the result of her ten years of research into Vorilhon and his movement, with evidence to support the conclusion that Raël has copied concepts from, and often paraphrased full paragraphs from, other UFO and ancient astronaut authors of the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, such as Sendy, Brinsley Trench, and Robert Charroux. In her book, the dialogue of Raël&#x27;s &quot;encounter with an ET&quot; is shown to closely resemble that of &quot;contactee&quot; George Adamski, who claimed that he had an encounter on 13 December 1952.

Much of the Raëlian philosophy also closely matches that of Osho. The white costume Raël wears closely resembles one that Osho was known to have worn.

===Appearances in the media===
In 1992, Raël appeared on &quot;Ciel mon Mardi&quot;, a French talk show hosted by journalist Christophe Dechavanne. Toward the end of the show, Raël&#x27;s sexual liberalism was critiqued by a priest, a social worker, and a psychologist. A former Raëlian, Jean Parraga, believed that his wife and children were being held as prisoners, and that Raël attempted to break up his family. Parraga thought that his wife and children were being treated like criminals in activities such as orgies and sacrifices that involve children, at the Sensual Meditation camp. Parraga also had a criminal record as a drug dealer and car thief, and in August 1992, he attempted to shoot Raël.

Raëlians from around the world sent letters of protest to Dechevanne&#x27;s TV station. Dechavanne portrayed that as &quot;incitement to violence&quot; and sued Raël. The judge appointed to the case decided to question Raël. Raël agreed to ask his members to stop sending letters if the station apologized publicly. The two parties agreed to drop the feud.

In 2004, Raël appeared on the first airing of the Quebec version of the French talk show &quot;Tout le monde en parle&quot;, hosted by Guy A. Lepage. During this appearance, Raël upset panel members with his statements on democracy and cloning. The situation reached its peak when caricaturist Serge Chapleau called Raël a &quot;farce&quot; and a &quot;nerd&quot;, ridiculed his clothes, and grabbed him by the back of his neck. Raël left the stage, followed by his disciples. A fellow guest on the show, Parti Québécois Member of Quebec Legislative Assembly Pauline Marois, who later became premier of Quebec, called Raël &quot;insane&quot;. The Raëlian Movement asked Marois to apologize; she refused.

A Swiss newspaper that called Raëlians &quot;rat heads&quot; was sued for defamation. Another suit was brought against journalist Stephane Baillargeon for writing in the Montreal daily &quot;Le Devoir&quot; that Raëlians defend pedophiles and that certain ex-Raëlians claim the &quot;gourou&quot; likes very young girls. After some negotiation, &quot;Le Devoir&quot; published a letter from Raël condemning the charge as &quot;ignominious defamation&quot; and asserting that the Raëlian Movement had &quot;always condemned pedophilia and promoted respect for laws that justly forbid the practices that are always the fault of unbalanced individuals&quot;.

===Appearances in court===
In 1991, Raël sued French journalist Jean-Yves Cashga for defamation; Raël lost and was ordered to pay court costs. The judgment remains uncollected. Amid growing legal problems in France, Raël emigrated to Canada.

On two separate court dates of 2 September 1994 at the High Courts of Paris and 1 October 1996 at the Appeal Court of Paris, journalists Jacques Cotta and Pascal Martin of Flammarion Publishing were found guilty of attributing racist statements and distorted quotations to Raël in their book &quot;Dans le secret des sectes&quot;. They were fined 10,000FF in damages and 13,000FF in proceedings costs, ordered to insert stickers mentioning the sentence on copies not yet distributed and to suppress of the passage in the next editions, and told that they would be fined 100FF for each non-conforming copy.

On 26 January 1994, in emergency proceedings by the Appeal Court of Reims, Myriam Assan was accused of defamation for claiming in her book that &quot;Raël was often sentenced for corruption of minors&quot;. Assan was given a provisional sentence of 10,000FF in damages and ordered to withdraw the book. She was sentenced to pay a penalty of 300FF per infringement and 5,000FF in proceedings costs and to publish the judgment in &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Le Figaro&quot;.

On 13 December 1994, Gérard Chol, director of &quot;Le Maine Libre&quot;, was declared guilty by the High Court of Le Mans for public defamation for claiming that the Raël&#x27;s movement was laundering money coming from drug trafficking, prostitution, arms dealing, and the sale of pornographic videotapes. Chol was ordered to pay 1FF in damages and 3,000FF in proceedings costs and to publish the penal judgment in &quot;Le Maine Libre&quot;.

In 2003, Vorilhon sued Ottawa columnist Denis Gratton and &quot;Le Droit&quot; newspaper for $85,000 in defamation damages over a 23 January 2003 column; Raël lost and was ordered to pay court costs by Quebec Superior Court on 21 June 2006.

===Government action against Raël===

In response to Raël&#x27;s association with Clonaid, South Korean immigration authorities at the airport denied him entry into their country in 2003. A planned Raëlian seminar continued, with Raël making some brief &quot;big screen&quot; video-camera appearances via the internet for the several hundred who attended. Raël instructed South Korean Raëlians to protest near the Ministry of Health and Welfare that ordered him to leave.

In February 2007, Raël, who wanted to start commercial activities with Swiss vintners, was denied residence in the Swiss Canton Valais, in part because he was feared to be endangering public values by promoting sexual liberty and the education of children on how to obtain sexual pleasure. Also cited was his association with the Clonaid human cloning claim; Switzerland forbade human cloning. In a brief statement, Raël said he considered appeal at the European level.

<text>All-American Comics is a comics anthology and the flagship title of comic book publisher All-American Publications, one of the forerunners of DC Comics. It ran for 102 issues from 1939 to 1948. Characters created for the title, including Green Lantern, the Atom, the Red Tornado, Doctor Mid-Nite, and Sargon the Sorcerer, later became mainstays of the DC Comics line.

== Publication history ==
&quot;All-American Comics&quot; published 102 issues from April 1939 to October 1948. The series was an anthology which included a mixture of new material and reprints of newspaper strips. Sheldon Mayer&#x27;s Scribbly was introduced in the first issue as was Hop Harrigan. 

The Golden Age Green Lantern was introduced by artist/creator Martin Nodell in issue #16 (July 1940). He continued in the title until #102 (Oct 1948).

The Golden Age Atom debuted in #19 (October 1940) and Mayer created the original Red Tornado in #20 (November 1940). 

Doctor Mid-Nite first appeared in #25 (April 1941), while Howard Purcell and John Wentworth introduced Sargon the Sorcerer in the following month&#x27;s issue. 

Alfred Bester and Paul Reinman created the monstrous supervillain Solomon Grundy in #61 (October 1944). 

Other features included &quot;Toonerville Folks&quot;, &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot;, and &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;.

All-American Publications and all its titles were purchased by National Periodicals (DC Comics) in 1946. Responding to the demand for Western comics, &quot;All-American Comics&quot; changed title and format with #103 (November 1948) to &quot;All-American Western&quot;. The retitled series had Johnny Thunder as the lead feature. It changed title and format again to &quot;All-American Men of War&quot; as of #127 (August–September 1952).

A May 1999 one-shot issue by writer Ron Marz and artist Eduardo Barreto was a part of the &quot;Justice Society Returns&quot; storyline.

==Features==
* Scribbly the Boy Cartoonist: issues #1-59
* Green Lantern: issues #16-102
* The Atom: #20-46, 48-61, 70-72

<doc id="465990" wikidata="Q1464213" url="?curid=465990" title="Home of the Underdogs">
<text>Home of the Underdogs (often called HotU) is an abandonware archive founded by Sarinee Achavanuntakul, in October 1998.

Before shutting down the original version in 2009, the site provided reviews for over 5,300 games and offered downloads of software and manuals for a number of games that were no longer commercially available. This allowed it to be a valuable resource to players who lost the original discs or manuals. While a majority of games available on the site were for DOS or Microsoft Windows, the site also contained a section with games for other platforms. Where downloads for these games were provided, they were usually present in formats compatible with emulators. The site also had scans of several gamebook series, many of them complete. In addition to commercial titles, the site contained hundreds of freeware titles.

==History==
===Homeoftheunderdogs.org===
Achavanuntakul, a Thai journalist, had been in the United States at that time and wanted to play MicroProse&#x27;s 1989 title &quot;Sword of the Samurai&quot;, as her copy had fallen apart. However, by 1998, MicroProse no longer was selling any copies of the title, forcing Achavanuntakul to seek out a copy through an abandonware webring, eventually coming across the title offered to be played through emulation. She was surprised that other older, popular titles such as Infocom and Quantum Quality Productions were not available through these sites, and took it upon herself to launch &quot;Home of the Underdogs&quot; that October, a more permanent site for users to obtain abandonware. Initially, she had about 20 games offered but within a few months, had gained help from others to expand to about 80 games.

Around that time, her web hosting service Xoom took down the site without warning, given the issue of copyrights with abandonware. She relaunched early in 1999, now providing the files under a .bmp extension rather than .zip to avoid attracting Xoom&#x27;s notice. By the time the site had gotten to around 400 titles, Xoom permanently deleted the site, but Achavanuntakul had many offers for help from users around the globe to provide a more permanent hosting solution. At about the same time, her site gained attention from the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), the former name of the current Entertainment Software Association (ESA), the video game industry&#x27;s trade organization. The IDSA saw the offering of abandonware as a copyright violation for those publishers they represented, and Achavanuntakul complied with their requests by removing links to the software offered to otherwise keep the site going.

In January 2006, due to new responsibilities at work, Achavanuntakul had to step off running the site, allowing other admins to continue to maintain it.

===Hotud.org===
In early 2009, Home of the Underdogs had difficulty maintaining funding for its hosting duties, which led to the website&#x27;s shutdown. As the database of HOTU was released under a CC BY-NC-SA Creative Commons license in March 2009, a team had been able to rehost the website as &quot;hotud.org&quot; by September 2009. At the same time, the site established a partnership with GOG.com, a digital storefront that offered digital rights management-free games, to promote and offer some of the classic games that Underdogs had through GOG.com. Despite difficulties with providing direct access to abandonware, the new maintainers tried to reproduce the site&#x27;s databases and reviews for these early video games. The &quot;hotud.org&quot; site maintainers warned in February 2014 that financing for the servers was becoming difficult and they may need to take it offline. Hotud.org went offline in June 2017.

===Homeoftheunderdogs.net===
A new version of the website became available at &quot;homeoftheunderdogs.net&quot; since September 2009 and remains active as of January 2022.

==Impact==
While the legitimacy of abandonware with respect to copyrights remains in question, several game developers who had designed the games that were offered at &quot;Home of the Underdogs&quot;, such as Chris Crawford, had written to Achavanuntakul to thank her for helping their games to be introduced to new players. Several more recent game developers including Derek Yu and Ben &quot;Yahtzee&quot; Croshaw credit Home of the Underdogs for helping them to get interested in video game development. The site was considered critical towards helping with digital preservation, since most publishers at the time did not keep materials of games that they had taken out of print.

<doc id="465992" wikidata="Q2392428" url="?curid=465992" title="Tanganyika groundnut scheme">
<text>The Tanganyika groundnut scheme, or East Africa groundnut scheme, was a failed attempt by the British government to cultivate tracts of its African trust territory Tanganyika (now part of Tanzania) with peanuts.

Launched in the aftermath of World War II in 1946 by the Labour Party administration of prime minister Clement Attlee, the goal was to produce urgently needed oilseeds on a projected 3 million acres (5,000 sq miles, or over 12,000 km2, an area almost as big as Yorkshire), in order to increase margarine supplies in Britain and increase the profits from the British Empire. 

The scheme&#x27;s proponents, including Minister of Food John Strachey, had overlooked warnings that the environment and rainfall were unsuitable, communications were inadequate, and the project was being pursued with excessive haste. The disastrous project management, initially by the United Africa Company, and subsequently by the government-run Overseas Food Corporation, led the scheme to be popularly seen as a symbol of government incompetence and failure in late colonial Africa. 

Despite the enormous effort and spending £36 million (equivalent to over £1 billion in 2020), the project failed abjectly and was finally abandoned in 1951. It was described in 1953 as &quot;the worst fiasco in recent British colonial history.&quot;

==Background==
In the period after the Second World War, Britain was in significant debt to the United States, facing what John Maynard Keynes termed a &quot;financial Dunkirk&quot;, and the Attlee government sought the development of imperial territories to minimise their financial reliance upon the United States. Increasing the cultivation of food supplies in colonial territories, both for local consumption and export, was a central component of this strategy. The government subscribed to a Fabian view of colonial intervention which encouraged a proactive state role in producing primary materials and extending social benefits to colonial populations. The Tanganyika initiative represents part of a &quot;second colonial occupation&quot; within the British Empire, characterised by economic control and technological expertise.

In 1946, Frank Samuel, head of the United Africa Company, came up with an idea to cultivate groundnuts in Tanganyika, a British colonial territory under UN trusteeship, for the production of vegetable oil. Britain remained under World War II rationing and was short of cooking oils and fats, and especially margarine. He presented the idea to John Strachey, the Minister of Food, and in April 1946, the British government authorised a mission to visit suitable sites, led by John Wakefield, former Director of Agriculture in Tanganyika.

After a three-month mission, the team&#x27;s report in September 1946 was optimistically favourable to the scheme and recommended the cultivation of 3.21 million acres for groundnuts by 1952. The Cabinet approved the recommendations in January 1947, and began transporting personnel and machinery to Tanganyika. Officials began to recruit men for the &quot;Groundnut Army&quot; and 100,000 former soldiers volunteered for the 1,200 jobs.

==Cultivation==
The advance party set up camp at Kongwa, not far from Dodoma (now the capital of Tanzania), and scouted out the area. They deemed it suitable for groundnuts despite the large amount of clay and the local shortage of water, and established the scheme&#x27;s headquarters there. Gradually a whole town was established, known locally as &#x27;Half London&#x27;, as half the population of London seemed to wash up there over time.

Obtaining the heavy equipment necessary to clear the land for cultivation, however proved difficult. Eventually, the project managers found some suitable tractors and bulldozers from Canada and bought up U.S. Army surplus tractors from the Philippines, though many proved to be too rusted to use. These then had to be transported through the Port of Dar es Salaam, which became hopelessly congested, to the inland site using the only available transport, a single-track railway with steam locomotives. A sudden flood of the Kinyansungwe River wiped out part of the rail tracks, leaving a dirt road as the only means of transport. This delayed the arrival of the bulldozers needed for clearing until April 1947.

Even then, the bush proved far harder to clear than the planners had expected. Besides the natural hazards of local wildlife (on several occasions workers had to face angry elephants and rhinoceros), they found the large local baobab trees were hard to remove, a task made more difficult by one of them being a local tribal jail, another a site of ancestor worship, and many had bees&#x27; nests in their hollow trunks. Several workers were hospitalised with vicious bee stings.

But the main casualties were the heavy machines. By the end of the summer of 1947, two-thirds of the imported tractors had been rendered unusable. Bulldozer blades that were used to extract ground roots were ruined in a couple of days. In the spirit of &#x27;making do&#x27;, the scheme bought up surplus Sherman tanks and got the Vickers engineering company to take the armour off and put a bulldozer blade on the front, creating what were known as &quot;shervicks&quot;—but these too proved no match for the African bush. Eventually, in the wooded Southern Province, they discovered that a long chain linked between two bulldozers would flatten all the trees in between, while a third bulldozer was used to overturn any trees that resisted the chain. The first order for a suitable ship&#x27;s anchor chain from London was, however, cancelled by the managers in London because they thought it was a joke.

In September 1947, the African workers joined a nationwide strike for three days; the expatriate staff were less than delighted to have to do their own cooking. A growing number of Africans were then employed as tractor drivers and, after early errors, became skilled at the job.

With great difficulty, the Groundnut Army was finally able to plant the first nuts. When the rainy season arrived, some of the workshops and stores were swept away by a flash flood. After that, the hot season baked the ground clay into a hard surface that made harvesting the nuts very difficult.

==Takeover and railway construction==
In February 1948, the United Africa Company handed over responsibility for the project to the newly formed Overseas Food Corporation (OFC). It sent a new manager, Major-General Desmond Harrison, to the site. He found the scheme in a state of chaos, and immediately tried to instil some military discipline, which did not endear him to the workers, but subsequently retreated to his tent to concentrate on copious paperwork in a vain effort to contain the spiralling costs. Late in the year he was ordered back home on sick leave. 

In 1949, the Kongwa region was struck by a terrible drought, which decimated the crop. After two years, only 2,000 tons of groundnuts were harvested, less than had been imported as seed, and an attempt to grow sunflowers instead proved futile as they were even more susceptible to drought. 

The scheme&#x27;s managers therefore began to focus attention on the more fertile regions in the west and south of Tanganyika, but the development of both was proving painfully slow. In the south, not only was a whole new railway line needed, but a deep-water port had to be constructed from scratch at Mtwara. The Southern Province Railway was constructed first in order to transport the crops, but never had any to transport and was later dismantled.

The original target of 3 million acres was reduced to 150,000 acres (607 km2) and then to 50,000 acres (202 km2). In the end only 47,000 were ever cleared.

By late 1949, the scheme was coming in for robust criticism in Parliament and the press. The government persevered, but suffered for it at the election in 1950 and even more when they lost the 1951 United Kingdom general election. Just before that, in January 1951, they finally cancelled the project, the Treasury writing off a total of £36.5 million—equivalent in 2020 to over £1 billion. Mechanised production was stopped, and the cleared land handed over to African farmers, who did a better job growing tobacco and cashew nuts and herding cattle.

==Cultural references==
The 1950 British comedy film, &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot;, concludes with Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford quietly discussing in which remote and unattractive corner of the British Empire they might best try to pick up the pieces of their respective careers, and with her mentioning having a brother who &quot;grows groundnuts in Tanganyika.&quot;

<text>The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) is the eighth largest trade union in the United Kingdom. Most of its members work in UK government departments and other public bodies.

== History ==
The union was founded in 1998 by the merger of the Public Services, Tax and Commerce Union (which mostly represented the executive grades of the Civil Service) and the Civil and Public Services Association (mostly representing the clerical grades). The General Secretaries of the two unions, John Sheldon and Barry Reamsbottom respectively, became Joint General Secretaries of the new union. In 2000, Mark Serwotka was elected General Secretary and held the position until his retirement on 31 January 2024: he was elected unopposed in 2005 (no other candidate received enough valid nominations from PCS branches); he was re-elected in 2009 for a five-year term, and in 2014 was re-elected for a further five years. 

In 2018, the union won £3 million in damages from the Department for Work and Pensions, after a legal challenge against the withdrawal of the &quot;check off&quot; system of paying union subscriptions.

Fran Heathcote was elected as the union&#x27;s first female General Secretary, defeating Marion Lloyd. She assumed the office on 1 February 2024.

==Membership and organisation==
The union had 195,901 members at the end of 2015 and is the largest trade union representing civil servants in the UK.

PCS is organised into groups that deal with different bargaining units such as Revenue and Customs, Work and Pensions and Law and Justice.

Two factions compete in elections to the National Executive Committee of the PCS, its governing body: the ruling Left Unity faction, which stands candidates as part of the Democracy Alliance, and an opposing Independent Left faction.

==PCS Credit Union==
PCS Credit Union Limited is a savings and loans co-operative established by the trade union for its members in 2011. It is a member of the Association of British Credit Unions Limited, authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the PRA. Ultimately, like the banks and building societies, members’ savings are protected against business failure by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

==Affiliations==
Organisations to which PCS is affiliated include Abortion Rights, Amnesty International and the Cuba Solidarity Campaign.

==Strikes and protests involving PCS members==

=== 2008 ===
*In conjunction with Prospect, members at the Science Museum went on strike over pay.

===2010===

*On 8 March 2010, 270,000 civil servants began a 48-hour strike over government changes to redundancy payments.

===2011===
*The union voted for a one-day strike on 30 June 2011.

===2013===
*Strike action was organised for New Year&#x27;s Eve 2013 for all Metropolitan Police Civil Staff due to a pay dispute. Taking strike action on this day was deemed to be most effective because of the busy nature of the day for police. The MPS offered a below inflation wage increase of 1%. Another strike ballot was announced on 6 February 2014 for strike action on 12 and 13 February 2014.

*As part of the union&#x27;s budget day strikes, a series of protests took place across branches in the Culture Group, including Tate and National Museums Liverpool to highlight the effect of government cuts to arts funding.

===2014===
*PCS announced they would be joining a national strike alongside other unions on Budget Day - 10 July, over pay restraint and austerity in the public sector.

=== 2015 ===
*From 11 August 2015, PCS members at the National Gallery took indefinite strike action against a proposed privatisation of the security staff at the gallery. The strike lasted for over 100 days.

*At the Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales branch, members voted for strike action after proposals to end their weekend pay premiums.

*Members of the Royal Household branch, including staff at Windsor Castle, voted for action short of a strike in an effort to achieve the Living Wage.

*Another of the union&#x27;s Culture Group branches went on strike in December 2015 against the removal of weekend allowances. The dispute at the National Museum of Scotland branch was eventually ended when funding from the Scottish Government enabled a buy out of the allowances.

=== 2016 ===
*Cleaners in HMRC went on strike as their outsourced employer, ISS, claimed it couldn&#x27;t afford the Government&#x27;s new National Living Wage.

=== 2017 ===
*Strike action of Driving Examiners was organised for 4 and 5 December to coincide with the introduction of new driving tests in order to protest against the introduction of Satellite Navigation to the test on 4 December. Examiners also voted started work to rule on 23 November.

=== 2019 ===
*In conjunction with GMB, PCS members at Historic Royal Palaces took strike action against proposed changes to their pensions. This was the first time the Beefeaters had been on strike in 55 years.

*Outsourced workers at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) went on strike to demand the London Living Wage in a coordinated action with United Voices of the World (UVW) union members at the nearby Ministry of Justice.

*In December 2019, Security Guards and Front of House workers at Wallace Collection successfully protested outside an exhibition opening to secure the London Living Wage.

=== 2020 ===
*Following mass redundancies in the arts and culture sector caused by the COVID-19 lockdown, PCS members working for the commercial arm of Tate galleries in London took 42 days strike action against mass redundancies. A further 300 redundancies were also announced at Southbank Centre, leading to mass protests by PCS members outside the venues.

=== 2021 ===
*After a large, and in several cases fatal, COVID-19 outbreak in the offices of the Drivers and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), PCS members took multiple days of strike action in June and July to highlight the lack of adequate health and safety protection.

<doc id="466014" wikidata="Q5455733" url="?curid=466014" title="Fitzsimons Army Medical Center">
<text>Fitzsimons Army Hospital, also known as Fitzsimons General Hospital, renamed Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in 1974, and Fitzsimons Building in 2018 was a U.S. Army facility located on in Aurora, Colorado. The facility opened in 1918 and closed in 1996. The grounds were then redeveloped for civilian use as the Anschutz Medical Campus and the Fitzsimons Innovation Community.

==History==
=== Native people ===
The land the facility occupies is the sacred and ancestral territory of the Pawnee and Jicarilla Apache peoples. These groups controlled the land in the 1500s.

=== Founding ===
The facility was founded by the United States Army during World War I arising from the need to treat the large number of casualties from chemical weapons in Europe. Denver&#x27;s reputation as a prime location for the treatment of tuberculosis led local citizens to lobby the Army on behalf of Denver as the site for the new hospital. In February 1918, the War Department recommended to Congress $500,00 be expended on constructions of the Denver hospital. Additionally, local business owners raised $150,000 to purchase the property east of Denver that previously belonged to A. H. Gutheil Nursery. U.S. Army General Hospital No. 21, as it was first called, had ground breaking in April 1918, was formally dedicated and opened on October 13, 1918, in Aurora, which at the time had a population of less than 1,000. The campus consisted of 86 stucco buildings and capacity for 1,400 patients. The first commander of the hospital was Colonel William P. Harlow, a Boulder native. He began his term on August 27, 1918, and had been the Dean of the University of Colorado Medical School before World War I. Elizabeth D. Reid served as the first head nurse. Construction of the hospital was not officially completed until 1919. The final construction cost was $3.2 million. 

=== 1920s ===
On July 1, 1920, the facility was formally renamed the Fitzsimons General Hospital after Lt. William T. Fitzsimons, the first American medical officer (a surgeon) killed in World War I. By the 1920s, the hospital was the largest tuberculosis hospital in the United States using heliotherapy as one of the major forms of treatment. The hospital admitted and discharged approximately 300 patients per month while also serving as a general hospital for active military and veterans in the Denver area. In 1926 the Fitzsimons radio station KEUP was started.

=== 1930s and early 1940s ===

The facility was being prepared for closure by the Army during the economic depression of the 1930s. In April 1933, Surgeon General R. U. Patterson sent a radiogram stating that Fitzsimons would be abandoned and all patients transferred. However, Denver&#x27;s reputation for treating tuberculosis and the consequences of losing 1,000 jobs at Fitzsimons led to citizen lobbying for Denver to be the site of a new Army hospital. U.S. Senator Lawrence C. Phipps was also a promotor of Fitzsimons Army Hospital and his efforts led to Congress approving funding in November 1934 to keep the hospital open. The Army maintained the hospital in the budget for a few years before asking for work-relief funds to rebuild and modernize the facility in 1935. From 1935-1936 several improvement projects were carried out by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Fitzsimons on October 12, 1936, and vowed to maintain the hospital. In 1937, the land needed for construction of a new facility was officially turned over to the federal government, which paved the way for future development. In 1938, Congress approved $3.75 million in Public Works Administration funds for a new hospital and construction of a new main building, known as Building 500, began in January 1939 and was completed in 1941. At the time, it was the largest structure in Colorado and the largest single hospital structure ever built by the Army. The building completed with 290,000 sq ft, 1,800 rooms, ten stories, and 2,252 beds. The property was divided into two sections along a line extending through Monteview Street. Property north of the line was designated for commercial development. Property to the south was designated for medical and educational purposes, which is the current day School of Medicine and many hospitals. Building 500 got its name from its location exactly at the center of the south property and 500 yards from Montview Street. The building construction followed a Modernistic style, which was state-of-the-art for military hospitals at the time. The supervising architect for the Army Quartermaster Corps, L. M. Leisenring oversaw the design and construction of the building in a Modernistic Art Deco style. Building materials included several blended colors of face brick, Texas sandstone, Yule Marble for the main entrance, Colorado Travertine stone for the walls, and granite for the paving and curbs under the entrance. The grand portico above the main entrance was inscribed with three Latin phrases: &quot;Vita Brevis Ars Vero Longa&quot;, meaning &quot;Life is short, art is enduring&quot;, &quot;Salus Virtus et Robur Artubus Scientia et Virtute et Bonis Artibus&quot;, meaning &quot;Health, strength and vigor to the sinews (body) with the help of science, virtue and the arts&quot;, and &quot;Non Sibi Sed Proximo&quot; ,&quot;Not for himself but for the next one to him&quot;. At the time the building was dedicated by Congressman Lewis on December 3, 1941, it had 290,000 sq ft and 608 beds.

=== World War II ===
Four days after the dedication, Pearl Harbor was attacked and soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who injured began arriving on December 17. At the peak of its development during World War II, the number of hospital beds increased to 3,500 and the hospital contained as many as 5,000 patients at a time. This was accomplished by the hasty construction of many temporary buildings. The hospital campus had also grown to become the largest military hospital in the world with 322 buildings on about 600 acres. In April 1943, a post newspaper &quot;The Stethoscope&quot; was first published and formal publication lasted until the closure of the base. In 1944, the first members of the Women&#x27;s Army Corps (WAC) arrived at Fitzsimons. In 1947, the Prisoner of War camp was razed. In 1948, Fitzsimons became one of the first hospitals to use streptomycin to treat tuberculosis.

=== 1950s ===
In the 1950s, tuberculosis cases dropped with improvements in public health and lung cancer and other chest diseases became the focus. The hospital was renamed Fitzsimons Army Hospital in July 1950 and a pre-school and kindergarten were opened. In 1952, the 8th floor auditorium was named for Col. George E. Bushnell, who was responsible for inspecting and identifying the site of the future hospital in 1918. In 1953, Korean prisoners of was were treated at Fitzsimons and three departments were established: Medicine, Surgery, and Neuropsychiatry. In 1955, a new chapel and credit union were opened.

===President Eisenhower stay, 1955===
The facility was used heavily during World War II to treat returning casualties and became one of the Army&#x27;s premier medical training centers. In the 1950s, Dwight Eisenhower received treatment at the facility three separate times for his heart condition while he was president. In the early morning hours of September 24, 1955, about five weeks into a &quot;work and play&quot; vacation at his in-laws&#x27; house in Denver, he suffered a myocardial infarction and was placed in an oxygen tent at the facility. He spent seven weeks convalescing in his suite on the eighth floor (Room 8002) of Building 500.

The entirety of the floor was cordoned off from the rest of the hospital, and was referred to as the &quot;Western White House&quot;. Flowers lined the hallways of the suite as well wishes sent from people all over the world. Mamie would assist in reading and responding to those that sent messages of good wishes and prayerful concerns to the President. Eisenhower was taken outside to the roof when his health improved and he would occasionally paint scenes of his memories from Colorado. He was motivated to try painting for relaxation after seeing how it had helped Winston Churchill. Mamie Eisenhower was provided with her own bedroom so she could be close by and assist in her husband&#x27;s recovery. Her room was similar to her husband&#x27;s with the exceptions of having a sofa, chair, television, and telephone. Mamie asked for her pink toilet seat to be shipped from the White House and installed in her room (Room 8021). The toilet seat is now in Eisenhower&#x27;s family home in Gettysburg, PA. Another room on the eighth floor was designated for Secret Service use. Only authorized visitors were allowed to site in this room and wait to meet with the President. President Eisenhower&#x27;s personal physician, Dr. Howard McCrum Snyder, also had a room on the eighth floor in order to be available at all times. Also on the eighth floor, the Bushnell Auditorium uses converted from hosting medical conferences to a command post and office for Presidential Aide Colonel Robert Schultz, and a theater for Mamie and others to watch westerns, comedies, and other movies popular at the time.
Eisenhower celebrated his 65th birthday, October 14, 1955, while in the Fitzsimons hospital. Of the many gifts he received, he frequently used a set of maroon pajamas embroidered with &quot;Much Better Thanks&quot; on the left pocket given to him by the White House Press Corps. Eisenhower worn these pajamas on his first public appearance on October 25, 1955 on the hospital rooftop, an occasion documented on the cover of Life Magazine (vol. 39, 1955). The President and Mrs. Carlos Castillo-Armas of Guatemala visited Eisenhower on November 9, 1955. After his discharge on Armistice Day, November 11, 1955, Eisenhower spent a few weeks with his family in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania at his family&#x27;s farm. In October 1956, Eisenhower returned to Denver to visit with the people who had nursed him back to health. He talked briefly to the thousands of assembled well-wishers and then proceeded to a huge tent that was set up for his visit with Fitzsimons personnel.

After Eisenhower&#x27;s stay, the suite stood vacant for many years, eventually becoming an office. In 1995, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended the closure of Fitzsimons and the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center secured much of the Fitzsimons site for the relocation of the Denver campus at East 9th Avenue and Colorado Boulevard. In 2000, work began to restore the suite of rooms on the hospital&#x27;s eighth floor to appear as they did when Eisenhower was recovering there. This was made possible through a $67,100 SHF grant, a $10,000 donation from Wells Fargo, and matching funds from the University of Colorado. The restored suite opened in 2003 and features many time period pieces such as nurse-call buttons, glass ashtrays, a Secret Service sitting room, nurse&#x27;s station, and a private dining room. Also viewable from the roof deck on the south side was a golden eagle on top of the flag pole, which signifies Building 500 as one of only seven locations in the United States that served as a seat of government.

===Clinical Specialist School era, 1960s===
On January 1, 1960, the name was changed back to Fitzsimons General Hospital and became further known for its &quot;Clinical Specialist School,&quot; at that time one of the longest professional schools for enlisted US military personnel. US Army medics of varied service and rank studied both academically and in rotation on the hospital&#x27;s wards. At the end of close to a year of study, those students who had previously gained &quot;Combat Medic&quot; (91A10) and &quot;Medical Specialist&quot; (91B20) proficiency now graduated as &quot;Clinical Specialists&quot; (91C20), a level of medical proficiency which paralleled that of the &quot;Licensed Practical Nurse&quot; (LPN or LVN) in the civilian world, but inclusive of additional skills such as treatment of basic wound trauma and elemental surgical methods more applicable to military wartime nursing. Most of the 91C20s (&quot;Ninety-one Charlies&quot;) would find themselves working with registered nurses in military hospital settings, but as the Vietnam War was at its height in the late 1960s, certain graduates would move on to Special Forces assignments and such as Medical Civic Action assistance (MEDCAPs) for those Vietnamese living in more remote regions, and so often forced to go without the benefits enjoyed by Vietnamese living near cities. &quot;Ninety-one Charlies&quot; proved well suited to a medical niche previously wanting for civilian-certified Practical Nurses.

During this decade, the hospital had many patients that were amputees, approximately 100 per year. This figure represented 10 percent of the orthopedic population at the time.

=== 1970s ===
In 1971, a drug dependency program began for returning Vietnam veterans. In 1972, Fitzsimons became the first Army hospital to obtain an Argon Ion Laser Photocoagulator, which was used in treating some eye problems. On March 1, 1973, the hospital took its fourth name, Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, one of eight such institutions in the country. In 1977, the tuberculosis ward was closed. In March 1979, a $3.75 million CT scanner was delivered.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, the medical center became the first to have a full-time civilian home nursing services coordinator. In November 1984, a new $1.8 million cardiac catheterization laboratory opened. In 1989, the medical center was removed from Base Closure studies.

===Closure and transfer of facilities, 1990s===

With the end of the Cold War in 1991, Fitzsimons was showing its age and not directly involved with any active military installations. In July 1995, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission recommended the closure of the facility, with the exception of the Edgar J. McWhethy Army Reserve Center, located at the southeast corner of the installation. The hospital took its fifth name as U.S. Army Garrison Fitzsimons with the closure of the larger Army base on June 8, 1996. At the time of closure, Fitzsimons was one of Aurora&#x27;s largest employers, with approximately 3,000 employees and $328 million in economic activity. The healthcare duties of the hospital were transferred to Fort Sam Houston, Texas.

=== University of Colorado ===
In summer 1996, the University of Colorado commissioned a study of the Fitzsimons site to determine feasibility of moving to the site. On November 14, 1996, the Board of Regents approved te Plan for Acquisition and Development of Fitzsimons Property. An agreement with the City of Aurora Regarding Redevelopment of Fitzsimons Property was approved on April 24, 1997. The closure was completed in 1999 and the reserve center was relocated to the northeast portion of the site. The projected $5 billion (Economic Contributions of Activities at Fitzsimons Life Science District and the UC Denver Anschutz Medical Campus - Sammons/Dutton LLC, 2008) redevelopment of the facility into civilian use currently includes the construction of the University of Colorado Hospital&#x27;s $147 million Anschutz Inpatient Pavilion, and the $509-million Children&#x27;s Hospital. The medical campus also includes University of Colorado Denver medical education and research facilities, including the Ben Nighthorse Campbell Center for Native American Research, named in honor of the U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado. In 2008, the redeveloped Fitzsimons campus employed 16,000 workers and generated approximately $3.5 billion for Colorado&#x27;s economy.

==Postal history==
The hospital generated and received large volumes of postal material when letter writing was more common, and still houses a U.S.P.S postal annex providing services to the Anschutz campus community to this day.

Efforts have been made to preserve the postal boxes in the ground floor lobby as well as the elaborate mail chute system that was used to collect mail from all eight floors of the building.

==Building restoration and rehabilitation==
Two SHF grants have been awarded to support restoration and rehabilitation efforts on Building 500. Grant number 16-02-014 was awarded in 2016 to the Anschutz Medical Campus from the Acquisition and Development Fund in the amount of $200,000. Grant number 19-01-006 was awarded in 2019 to the Board of Regents of the University of Colorado, a body corporate, for and on behalf of the University of Colorado Denver from the Acquisition and Development Fund in the amount of $200,000. Both of these grants were used to restore windows on the building.

Additional facilities currently built at the former base include the Bioscience Park Center and Bioscience East (multi-tenant commercial lab buildings in the planned Colorado Science+Technology Park at Fitzsimons) and 21 Fitzsimons(a residential/retail town center). The Veterans Affairs Medical Center was opened in 2018.

In the Spring of 2013 a Donor Memorial Garden opened on the southeast lawn of the building. The garden serves to honor the whole body donors that are part of the Colorado State Anatomical Board and a popular meeting place on campus. Each class that was involved in fundraising for the garden are represented with a paver engraved with a quote voted on by class members.

== United States Army Medical Equipment and Optical School ==
In 1963, the United States Army Medical Equipment and Optical School (USAMEOS) was transferred to the installation. USAMEOS provided technicians trained in biomedical equipment repair or optical laboratory operations. Biomedical equipment repair personnel (referred to as BMETs—pronounced &#x27;bee/mets&#x27;) were assigned to military medical units to install, maintain, repair, and calibrate sophisticated life support, diagnostic, imaging, and general medical equipment. Military Occupation Specialties (MOS) graduating from USAMEOS included: 35G, 35S, 35T, and 35U. Optical laboratory technicians were designated as 42E upon graduation of the 21-week optical training course. In the hallways of the USAMEOS training facility hung the pictures of graduating BMET classes over decades of operation.

When the USAMEOS program was first developed, the training program was divided into Basic and Advanced Courses. The basic course work was 20 weeks long. The advanced course work was 32 weeks long. The courses were later changed to a 40-week basic class (35G) and 32-week advanced course (35U). The graduates of the basic course were known as &quot;Super G&#x27;s&quot; referring to the MOS of 35G. With a small amount of additional course work, USAMEOS graduates could earn an AAS in Biomedical Equipment Maintenance from Regis University in Denver.
During the 1990s, the MOS designation was changed to 91A for Biomedical Equipment Repair Technician, and the Basic Course consisted of a 38-week course broken up into twelve modules. Didactic Modules included Anatomy and Physiology, Basic Soldering, AC/DC theory and Ohm&#x27;s law, electron theory, Transistor Theory, Digital Circuits, Basic Troubleshooting, Dental and Pneumatic Devices, heating and cooling, Sterilizers and Ultrasonic Cleaners, Linear Circuits, Spectrophotometers and Solid State Relays, advanced troubleshooting, cryogenics primer, high and low capacity modules of X-ray, The school culminated in a field problem where students lived in ISOs and temper tents while filling out paperwork in the field environment to include pulling guard duty and setup of mobile sterile operating units and generators.. After graduation from the basic course, students would typically be assigned to an operational unit for practical work between the Basic and Advanced Courses. Technical training at USAMEOS was accelerated, 8 hours per day in class, it was intensive and provided both engineering theory and hands on learning opportunities in an extensive set of labs. The school closed in 1999 due to base closure.

Fitzsimons was a training center for phase II of the ARMY practical nurse (91C) from —- to the last class graduating 22 March 1996.

<doc id="466018" wikidata="Q1438462" url="?curid=466018" title="Fort Moore">
<text>Fort Moore (formerly Fort Benning) is a United States Army post in the Columbus, Georgia area. Located on Georgia&#x27;s border with Alabama, Fort Moore supports more than 120,000 active-duty military, family members, reserve component soldiers, retirees and civilian employees on a daily basis. As a power projection platform, the post can deploy combat-ready forces by air, rail, and highway for their designated mission. Fort Moore is the home of the United States Army Maneuver Center of Excellence, the United States Army Armor School, United States Army Infantry School, the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (formerly known as the School of the Americas), elements of the 75th Ranger Regiment, the 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade, and other tenant units.

Established in 1918 as Camp Benning, named after Confederate General Henry L. Benning in the American Civil War, it was the Home of the Infantry. In 1922 Camp Benning became Fort Benning. In 2005, it was transformed into the Maneuver Center of Excellence, as a result of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission&#x27;s decision to consolidate a number of schools and installations to create various &quot;centers of excellence&quot;. Included in this transformation was the move of the Armor School from Fort Knox to Fort Moore.

== Name ==
The installation was originally named for Henry L. Benning, a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army during the Civil War. Fort Benning was one of the ten U.S. Army installations named for former Confederate generals that were renamed on 11 May 2023.

As a result of national protests following the 25 May 2020 murder of George Floyd, a black man, by Minneapolis police, Congress began to evaluate Democratic proposals to strip the names of Confederate leaders from military bases, including Fort Benning. The congressionally mandated Naming Commission recommended that Fort Benning be renamed Fort Moore after Lieutenant General Hal Moore and his wife Julia Compton Moore, both of whom are buried on post. On 6 October 2022, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin accepted the recommendation and directed the name change occur no later than 1 January 2024. The redesignation ceremony officially renaming Fort Benning as Fort Moore was held on 11 May 2023, the day the renaming took effect.

==History==
=== Establishment ===
Camp Benning was established 19 October 1918, initially providing basic training for World War I units, post-war. Dwight D. Eisenhower served at Benning from 24 December 1918, until 15 March 1919, with about 250 of his Camp Colt, Pennsylvania, tankers who had been transferred to Benning after the armistice. In December 1918, a portion of the Camp Polk tank school near Raleigh, North Carolina was transferred to Camp Benning &quot;to work in conjunction with the Infantry school&quot;. Camp Benning tank troops were moved to Camp Meade in February 1919.

In February 1920, Congress voted to declare Camp Benning a permanent military post and appropriated more than $1 million of additional building funds for the Infantry School of Arms, which later became the Infantry School. By the fall of 1920, more than 350 officers, 7,000 troops and 650 student officers lived at Camp Benning. The post was renamed to Fort Benning in 1922, after Henry L. Benning, a general in the army of the Confederate States of America. Benning fought against U.S. Army troops in the Civil War as commander of Confederate States Army forces.

In 1924, Brig. Gen. Briant H. Wells became the fourth commandant of the Infantry School and established the Wells Plan for permanent construction on the installation, emphasizing the importance of the outdoor environment and recreation opportunities for military personnel. During Wells&#x27; tenure, the post developed recreational facilities such as Doughboy Stadium, Gowdy Field, the post theater and Russ swimming pool. Doughboy Stadium was erected as a memorial by soldiers to their fallen comrades of World War I. One of the Doughboys&#x27; original coaches was a young captain named Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Lt. Col George C. Marshall was appointed assistant commandant of the post in 1927 and initiated major changes. Marshall, who later became the Army Chief of Staff during World War II, was appalled by the high casualties World War I caused, he thought, by insufficient training. He was determined to prevent a lack of preparation from costing more lives in future conflicts. He and his subordinates revamped the education system at Fort Benning. The changes he fostered are still known as the Benning Revolution. Later in his life, Marshall went on to author the Marshall Plan for reviving postwar Europe and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953.

=== World War 2 ===
In August 1940, two officers and 46 enlisted volunteers of what was known as the Parachute Test Platoon, made their first airborne jump over Lawson Field at Fort Benning after intensive training. Observers from several countries including Germany and the Soviet Union attended. These 48 were the seed that grew into the branches of America&#x27;s Airborne Infantry.
During World War II Fort Benning had with billeting space for 3,970 officers and 94,873 enlisted persons. Among many other units, Fort Benning was the home of the 555th Parachute Infantry Company, whose training began in December 1943. The unit&#x27;s formation was an important milestone for black Americans, as was explored in the first narrative history of the installation, &quot;Home of the Infantry&quot;. The battalion, later expanded to become the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion and nicknamed the Triple Nickels, was trained at Fort Benning but did not deploy overseas and never saw combat during World War II.

During this period, the specialized duties of the Triple Nickels were primarily in a firefighting role, with over one thousand parachute jumps as smoke jumpers. The 555th was deployed to the Pacific Northwest of the United States in response to the concern that forest fires were being set by the Japanese military using long-range incendiary balloons. The 82nd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion was activated 15 July 1940, and trained at the Fort. The 17th Armored Engineer Battalion became active and started training 15 July 1940.

=== Racial killings ===
On 28 March 1941, the body of Private Felix &quot;Poss&quot; Hall was found hanged in a shallow ravine near what is now Logan Avenue. Born 1 January 1922, in Millbrook, Alabama, he enlisted in the Army in August 1940. He was assigned to serve in the 24th Infantry Regiment at Fort Benning, an all-Black segregated unit formed after the Civil War. Two cousins and his best friend from Millbrook were also stationed at Fort Benning and bunked near him. Hall was known for being friendly and popular, and worked at the base sawmill. On 12 February he told his friends that he was headed to the post exchange for Black servicemen after his work shift. He was last seen alive around 4:00 p.m. in Block W, an all-white neighborhood between the mill and post exchange. He did not appear at bugle call the next morning, and was declared a deserter nearly a month after his disappearance.

His body was found by soldiers on 28 March 1941, hanging against the edge of a ravine in a wooded area. His death was officially declared a homicide, although military officials speculated he had committed suicide. A Fort Benning physician examined his body on 8 April and ruled it a homicide. A noose tied to a sapling was wrapped around his neck, his feet had been bound by baling wire and attached with a rope to other saplings, and his hands were tied behind him. The position of his feet indicated that he had attempted to pile dirt beneath his feet to help alleviate the pressure on his neck.

His murder became widely reported in Black newspapers throughout the country, and the only known publicly available photograph of Felix was published in The Pittsburgh Courier. The FBI conducted a 17-month long investigation, but ultimately no one was charged for the murder of Hall. On 3 August 2021, the Army unveiled a marker in memory of Felix Hall at the site where he was last seen alive. A memorial event was also held during the unveiling of his marker. His name is inscribed at the National Memorial for Peace and Justice.

On 23 March 1941, Private Albert King, a Black serviceman, was killed by Sergeant Robert Lummus, who was White, following an altercation on a bus. After a night of drinking, King, Pfc. Lawrence Hoover, and their girlfriends, were riding on a bus around 3:30 am, back to their barracks. King was shouting and &quot;cussing&quot;, according to the driver and other Black passengers. The driver stopped the bus near the Fort&#x27;s gates and Sergeant Lummus, a Military Police motorcycle officer, boarded the bus. When Lummus tried to take King and Hoover off the bus, King ran out the front door, and Lummus hit Hoover with a blackjack.

After taking Hoover into custody, Lummus later found a Black soldier walking back toward the main post. Lummus approached King and threatened to arrest him. When King claimed that Lummus could not do so, Lummus shot King five times, killing him. During the trial, later that day, it was claimed that King had drawn a pocket knife when approached by Lummus, though Hoover denied that King had a pocket knife with him. Lummus was found not guilty of murder and transferred the next day to Fort Knox.

=== Cold war ===
At the start of the Korean War an Airborne Ranger Training Center was established by Colonel John G. Van Houten under the direction of General J. Lawton Collins.

The 4th Infantry Division, first of four divisions committed by the United States to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, reorganized and completed its basic training at Fort Benning (Sand Hill and Harmony Church areas) from October 1950 to May 1951, when it deployed to Germany for five years.

The Airborne School on Main Post has three 249-foot (76 m) drop towers called &quot;Free Towers.&quot; They are used to train paratroopers. The towers were modeled after the parachute towers at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair in New York. Only three towers stand today; the fourth tower was toppled by a tornado on 14 March 1954.

During the spring of 1962 General Herbert B. Powell, Commanding General, U.S. Continental Army Command, directed that all instruction at the Infantry School after 1 July reflect Reorganization Objective Army Division structures. Therefore, the Infantry School asked for permission to reorganize the 1st Infantry Brigade under a ROAD structure. Instead, the Army Staff decided to inactivate the Pentomic-structured brigade and replace it with a new ROAD unit, the 197th Infantry Brigade, which resolved a unit designation issue.

With the designation 1st Infantry Brigade slated to return to the 1st Infantry Division when it converted to ROAD, the existing unit at Fort Benning required a new title. The staff selected an infantry brigade number that had been associated with an Organized Reserve division that was no longer in the force. For the new ROAD brigade at Fort Benning, Georgia, the adjutant general on 1 August 1962, restored elements of the 99th Reconnaissance Troop, which thirty years earlier had been organized by consolidating infantry brigade headquarters and headquarters companies of the 99th Infantry Division, as Headquarters and Headquarters Companies, 197th and 198th Infantry Brigades.
Fort Benning was the site of the Scout dog school of the United States during the Vietnam War, where the dogs trained to detect ambushes in enemy terrain got their initial training, before being transferred to Vietnam for further advanced courses.

Fort Benning also had an urban village, McKenna Military Operations in Urban Terrain, built by Army engineers for urban training of soldiers. It was used for live, virtual and constructive experimentation on soldier systems, weapons, and equipment. The site was approximately 200 meters square, and included 15 buildings resembling a European village. There was a church, small houses, domestic residences and office-style buildings.

In 1984, following the signing of the Panama Canal Treaty, the School of the Americas relocated from Fort Gulick (Panama) to Fort Benning. After criticism concerning human rights violations committed by a number of graduates in Latin America, the school was renamed &quot;Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation&quot;.

=== 2024 Missing Weapons incident ===
31 M17 pistols, ENVGs and a thermal optic were reported stolen from Fort Moore&#x27;s central armory. The Army&#x27;s Criminal Investigation Division (CID) has offered a $15,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of the stolen items.

==Post information==
Portions of Fort Moore are in Muscogee, Chattahoochee, and Marion counties in Georgia. Additionally, portions of Fort Moore are in Russell County, Alabama. Muscogee County is a consolidated city-county with Columbus, and Chattahoochee County is a consolidated city-county with Cusseta.

There are four main cantonment areas on Fort Moore: Main Post, Kelley Hill, Sand Hill, and Harmony Church.

===Main Post===
Main Post houses various garrison and smaller FORSCOM units of Fort Moore such as 14th Combat Support Hospital and 11th Engineer Battalion FORSCOM as well as a number of TRADOC-related tenants, e.g. the Officer Candidate School, the Non-Commissioned Officers Academy, and the Airborne School. McGinnis-Wickham Hall (formerly known as Infantry Hall) is the post headquarters and Maneuver Center of Excellence. Adjacent is the Ranger Memorial and the National Infantry Museum. The Army Infantry School conducts its graduations on Inouye Field, sprinkled with soil from the battlegrounds of Yorktown, Antietam, Soissons, Normandy, Corregidor, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

===Kelley Hill===

The 197th Infantry Brigade was located on Kelley Hill in the 1970s and early 1980s

Kelley Hill formerly housed the 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized), the parent unit of two combined arms battalions; 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, as well as 3rd Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment, 1st Battalion, 10th Field Artillery Regiment, and two support battalions; the 203rd Brigade Support Battalion and the Special Troops Battalion, 3rd BCT. Included in the roster was the 179th Military Intelligence Detachment.

Between 11 December 2015, and 15 December 2015, the 3rd BCT&#x27;s six subordinate battalions performed inactivation ceremonies on Sledgehammer Field. On 16 December 2015, 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment Task Force (or Task Force 1-28) was activated in its place. Task Force 1-28 is a 1053-member unit &quot;made up of selected soldiers from the six inactivated battalions that formed the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division&quot;.

==Armor School move==
Fort Moore was selected by the Base Realignment and Closing Commission to be the home of the new Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE). This realignment co-located the United States Army Armor Center and School, formerly located at Fort Knox, Kentucky, with the Infantry Center and School. This transformation was completed September 2011.

==Education==

The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) operates on-base schools for Fort Moore children:
* Faith Middle School
* Herbert J. Dexter Elementary School
* McBride Elementary School
* Stowers Elementary School
* White Elementary School

High school students attend local public high schools operated by county governments. The portion in Muscogee County is zoned to high schools of Muscogee County Schools. The portion in Chattahoochee County is zoned to Chattahoochee County Schools.

Any Fort Moore pupil, however, may attend Muscogee County schools if their parents wish, as per House Bill 224.

<text>Jaleleddin Farsi (; born 1934) is an Iranian politician who held various posts in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

==Biography==
Farsi was born in Mashhad in 1934. During his studies at high school he met Ali Shariati and joined the movement supporting the Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. He went to Iraq in 1955 where he was arrested by the authorities. Following his release from the prison he settled in Syria. Upon his return to Iran Farsi was arrested and imprisoned until October 1962. Then he joined the Ruhollah Khomeini&#x27;s opposition movement and delivered many speeches against the Shah. He left Iran and settled in Lebanon where he was trained in guerilla techniques. He was a senior Islamic Coalition member and maintained ties to Fada&#x27;iyan-e Islam. He served as a member of the parliament from 1984 to 1988. He was also elected to the 73-man Assembly of Experts for Constitution responsible for drafting the constitution in 1979.

Farsi belonged to the Islamic Republican Party&#x27;s radical faction and was its candidate for president in the 1980 election. However, he was replaced by Hassan Habibi after his Afghan origin was revealed (according to Article 115 of the constitution, president must be an Iranian citizen with Iranian origin).

==Murder case==
In 1992, Farsi killed a farmer in Taleqan during an argument. Four years later he was reportedly sentenced to the death penalty by the court of law. The case has never been cleared up.

<text>Edward Britt Husing (November 27, 1901 – August 10, 1962) was an American sports commentator. He was among the first to lay the groundwork for the structure and pace of modern sports reporting on radio and television.

== Overview ==

===Early life and career===
Husing was born in The Bronx, New York, and given the name Edmund. (One source says Husing was born in Deming, New Mexico. Another says, &quot;Husing was born in New Mexico, and while still in knee breeches was moved across to [sic] the United States to Gloversville, N.Y.&quot;) 

The youngest of three children of German immigrant parents, he was the only one to survive childhood. His father, Henry, was a fan of middleweight boxing champ Jimmy Edward Britt. By his tenth birthday, the boy&#x27;s name was changed to Edward Britt Husing. As a teenager, he took on the tag of &quot;Ted&quot; and the nickname stuck. He was active in four sports at Stuyvesant High School and was all-scholastic center in football.

At age 16, he joined the National Guard and in World War I was assigned to stand watch over New York&#x27;s harbor. Following the war, he floated between jobs such as carnival barker and payroll clerk. After he won an audition over 500 other applicants for announcer at New York City radio station WHN, Husing found his life&#x27;s calling. He was schooled under the tutelage of pioneer broadcaster J. Andrew White. There he covered breaking news stories and political conventions and assisted White during football commentaries.

By 1926, Husing was working at WJZ, which made him &quot;its specialist in announcing dance programs.&quot; A newspaper article reported that Husing was selected for the job &quot;out of 610 applications for the position of announcer at station WJZ.&quot;

As an announcer, Husing&#x27;s rapid manner of speech earned him the nickname &quot;Mile a Minute Husing&quot;. His use of descriptive language combined with a commanding voice made his broadcasts must-listen events. By 1927, he was voted seventh most popular announcer in a national poll. Following a pay dispute, he moved to Boston, where he broadcast Boston Braves (now Atlanta Braves) baseball games. 

Later in 1927, he returned to New York and helped his mentor, J. Andrew White, start the new CBS chain. After cigar mogul William S. Paley bought the cash-strapped network in 1928, Ted Husing rose to new heights of glory and fame.

===CBS===
At CBS, Husing took on a wide variety of events. In 1929, he was named studio director of WABC (the CBS flagship station) in addition to continuing his work as an announcer for the network.

He was the original voice of the &quot;March of Time&quot; program and an announcer for shows such as George Burns and Gracie Allen. Above everything, his work on sports gave Husing the greatest prominence. He covered events as diverse as boxing, horse racing, track and field, regattas, seven World Series, tennis, golf, four Olympic Games, Indianapolis 500 motor racing, and especially college football.

In addition to his sports preeminence, Husing did news and special events coverage for the CBS Radio Network. In the 1930s, he gave early tutelage to a budding CBS Radio announcer, Mel Allen, who, like Husing, would become a sportscaster. (And, like Husing, Allen would also understudy in news, with Robert Trout.) In 1933–1934, he was host of the &quot;Oldsmobile Program&quot;, providing sports news to complement music from other participants on the program. 

In both sports and special events areas, Husing developed a bitter rivalry with rising NBC announcer Bill Stern. When the two became the sports stars of their rival networks (and eventually their networks&#x27; sports directors), they would battle fiercely not only for events but also for broadcast position.

Husing could be arrogant, coarse, and opinionated. He was the first to bring a candid, editorial style to sports play-by-play. He was barred for two years by Harvard University from covering its home football games after he called All-American quarterback Barry Wood&#x27;s performance &quot;putrid&quot;. After criticizing World Series umpires in 1934, Husing was banned from doing play-by-play of the Fall Classic by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.

===Move from CBS to WHN===
In 1946, Husing moved from CBS to WHN (later WMGM) to pursue a career as a disk jockey. (He was succeeded as CBS Radio&#x27;s sports director by Red Barber.) Husing&#x27;s popular music show the &quot;Ted Husing Bandstand&quot; ran from 1946 to 1954. He continued to busy himself with sports assignments, including boxing on CBS and DuMont television, one year (1950) as the radio voice of New York Giants football, and as host of DuMont&#x27;s &quot;Boxing From Eastern Parkway&quot; from May 1952 to March 1953. Perhaps he was best known as the voice of Army football from 1947 to 1953. By that time, Husing&#x27;s yearly salary was close to half a million dollars.

The trade publication &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Husing&#x27;s dismissal from the DuMont boxing broadcasts &quot;set a precedent which is being labelled as a discredit to the industry.&quot; Husing&#x27;s departure was initially said to be for economic reasons, but later reports indicated that he was let go because of criticism by people in the boxing business. Husing had been employed by packager Emil Lence — not DuMont — so the decision was beyond the network&#x27;s control.

===Forced retirement and death===
In the spring of 1954, an operation to treat a malignant brain tumor left him blind and forced him to retire. He appeared on the television show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, broadcasters held a fundraiser for him in January 1957, and talk of a comeback followed. However, his condition worsened and the plans were stifled. After moving to Pasadena, California, under the care of his mother, Bertha, and daughter Peggemae, he died in 1962. He was interred at Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum in Pasadena.

===Awards===
In 1963, Husing became the second inductee of the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame.

In 1984, Husing was part of the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame’s inaugural class which included sportscasting legends Red Barber, Don Dunphy, Graham McNamee and Bill Stern.

===Books===
Husing wrote a memoir, &quot;Ten Years Before the Mike&quot;, published by Farrar &amp; Rinehart in 1935. It was also printed in serial form in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine.
He also wrote, with the &quot;as told to&quot; assistance of Cy Rice, a book about his blindness: &quot;My Eyes Are in My Heart&quot;. It was published in 1959 by Hillman Books.

==Legacy==
As a college football commentator for CBS, he laid down much of the structure of football play-by-play that is still used today. He devised some of the earliest spotting boards to identify the players on the field. Husing also interviewed coaches and players before games and attended strategy sessions.

In 1936, Husing narrated &quot;Catching Trouble&quot;, a Paramount non-sports newsreel documentary about herpetologist Ross Allen that would gain later prominence as a short subject on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, during which the characters parodied Husing&#x27;s distinctive delivery.

Husing has a star in the Radio section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6821 Hollywood Boulevard.

His &quot;on air&quot; voice was heard (as himself) over a radio in the 1936 Broadway stage production of &quot;Double Dummy&quot;, written by Doty Hobart and Tom McKnight and staged by Edith Meisner.

<text>The year 1616 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events.

==Astronomy==
* Galileo challenges the Catholic Church, saying Copernicus&#x27; heliocentric theory of the Solar System is correct. On February 24 he is forbidden to speak of Copernicus&#x27;s theories. Tommaso Campanella writes &quot;The Defense of Galileo&quot;.
* March 5 – Copernicus&#x27; &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (1543) is forbidden by the Congregation of the Index for reading &quot;until corrected&quot; (this is done in 1620: nine sentences, in which the heliocentric system is represented as certain, have to be either omitted or changed).

==Biology==
* William Harvey presents his views on the circulation of blood as Lumleian Lecturer at the College of Physicians, but will not publish them for a further dozen years.
* Fortunio Liceti publishes &quot; which marks the beginning of studies into malformations of the embryo.
* Fabio Colonna publishes &#x27; in Rome, including two appendices, &#x27; and &quot;, where he argues that &quot;tongue stones&quot; are of organic origin, being shark teeth, &quot;glossopetrae&quot;.

==Exploration==
* Robert Bylot and William Baffin, searching for the Northwest Passage, make a detailed exploration of Baffin Bay (March 26–August 30), discover Smith Sound, Lancaster Sound and Devon Island, and reach latitude 77° 45&#x27; North, a record for the Farthest North in America which holds for 236 years.

==Mathematics==
* English mathematician Henry Briggs visits Edinburgh to show John Napier his efficient method of finding logarithms by the continued extraction of square roots.

==Technology==
* Croatian mathematician Fausto Veranzio publishes &quot;Machinae novae&quot;, a book of mechanical and technological inventions, some of which are applicable to the solution of hydrological problems, and others concern the construction of water clocks, sundials, mills, presses, bridges and boats.
* Italian Giuliano Bossi invents a double-barreled gun.

==Publications==
* Publication of the alchemical allegory &quot;The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz&quot; (&quot;Chymische Hochzeit Christiani Rosencreutz anno 1459&quot;) anonymously (probably by Johannes Valentinus Andreae) in Strasbourg.

==Births==
* October 18 – Nicholas Culpeper, English herbalist (died 1654)
* November 22 – John Wallis, English mathematician who makes important contributions to the development of algebra and analytical geometry (died 1703)
* November 23 &quot;(bapt.)&quot; – John Kersey, English mathematician (died 1677)
* Kamalakara, Indian astronomer and mathematician (died 1700)
* &quot;approx. date&quot; – John French, English physician and chemist (died 1657)

==Deaths==
* March 3 – Matthias de l&#x27;Obel, Flemish-born physician and botanist (born 1538)
* March 19 – Johannes Fabricius, Frisian astronomer (born 1587)

<doc id="466042" wikidata="Q1270454" url="?curid=466042" title="Décollage">
<text>Décollage is an art style that is the opposite of collage; instead of an image being built up of all or parts of existing images, it is created by ripping and tearing away or otherwise removing pieces of an original image. The French word &quot;décollage&quot; translates into English literally as &quot;take-off&quot; or &quot;to become unglued&quot; or &quot;to become unstuck&quot;. Examples of décollage include etrécissements and cut-up technique. A similar technique is the &quot;lacerated poster&quot;, a poster in which one has been placed over another or others, and the top poster or posters have been ripped, revealing to a greater or lesser degree the poster or posters underneath.

==Practitioners of décollage==
An important practitioner of décollage was Wolf Vostell. Wolf Vostell noticed the word &quot;décollage&quot; in &quot;Le Figaro&quot; on 6 September 1954, where it was used to describe the simultaneous take-off and crash of an aeroplane. He appropriated the term to signify an aesthetic philosophy, applied also to the creation of live performances, Vostell&#x27;s working concept of décollage, was the Dé-coll/age and begun in 1954, is as a visual force that breaks down outworn values and replaces them with thinking as a function distanced from media. He also called his Happenings Dé-coll/age-Happening.

The most celebrated artists of the décollage technique in France, especially of the lacerated poster, are François Dufrene, Jacques Villeglé, Mimmo Rotella and Raymond Hains. Raymond Hains used the lacerated poster as an artistic intervention that sought to critique the newly emerged advertising technique of large-scale advertisements. In effect his decollage destroys the advertisement, but leaves its remnants on view for the public to contemplate. Often these artists worked collaboratively and it was their intention to present their artworks in the city of Paris anonymously. These four artists were part of a larger group in the 1960s called Nouveau Réalisme (New realism), Paris&#x27; answer to the American Pop Art movement. This was a mostly Paris-based group (which included Yves Klein, Christo and Burhan Dogancay and was created with the help of critic Pierre Restany), although Rotella was Italian and moved back to Italy shortly after the group was formed. Some early practitioners sought to extract the defaced poster from its original context and to take it into areas of poetry, photography, or painting.

Lacerated posters are also closely related to Richard Genovese&#x27;s practice of excavations. Contemporary artists employing similar décollage techniques are Mark Bradford, Michael Viviani and Brian Dettmer, who employs a novel method of decollage by removing material from books, leaving behind select images and text to form sculptural collages. Also there is Fizz Fieldgrass, an English artist, who uses digitally enhanced photographic images, overlaid by duplication on either Japanese Conservation Grade or fine Paper Mulberry, torn and rolled back to reveal other layers generating the three-dimensional image.

A cinematic example of décollage are the works of Spanish experimental filmmaker Antoni Pinent, each involving celluloid film strips.

==Déchirage==
Déchirage (from the French, : &#x27;to tear&#x27;) is an artistic style that distresses paper to create a three-dimensional patchwork. It is a form of décollage, taking the original image apart physically through incision, parting and peeling away. Romare Bearden (b. 1911 – d. 1988) the African American collage artist used déchirage as an important element of his abstract expressionist paintings. The first public display of &quot;Photographic&quot; Déchirage (the tearing of layers of digital photographs to create a distinctive three-dimensional image) was at the &quot;Art of Giving&quot; exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in 2010.

<doc id="466048" wikidata="Q699089" url="?curid=466048" title="Type 94 tankette">
<text>The Type 94 tankette (, literally &quot;94 type light armored car&quot;; also known as TK, an abbreviation of &quot;Tokushu Keninsha&quot;, literally &quot;special tractor&quot;) was a tankette used by the Imperial Japanese Army in the Second Sino-Japanese War, at Nomonhan against the Soviet Union, and in World War II. Although tankettes were often used as ammunition tractors, and general infantry support, they were designed for reconnaissance, and not for direct combat. The lightweight Type 94 proved effective in China as the Chinese National Revolutionary Army had only three tank battalions to oppose them, and those tank battalions were equipped only with some British export models and Italian CV-33 tankettes. As with nearly all tankettes built in the 1920s and 1930s, they had thin armor that could be penetrated by .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine gun fire at range.

==History and development==
From the 1920s, the Imperial Japanese Army tested a variety of European light tanks, including several Renault FTs, and a decision was reached in 1929 to proceed with the domestic development of a new vehicle based largely on the Carden-Loyd Mk VI tankette design to address the deficiencies of wheeled armored cars.

The initial attempt resulted in the Type 92 Jyu-Sokosha for use by the cavalry. However, Japanese infantry commanders felt that a similar vehicle would be useful as the support vehicle for transport, scout and communications within the infantry divisions.

A tankette fad occurred in Europe in the early 1930s, which was led by United Kingdom&#x27;s Carden-Loyd Mk VI tankette. The IJA ordered six samples from the UK, along with some French Renault UE Chenillette vehicles and field tested them. The IJA determined that the British and French machines were too small to be practical, and started planning for a larger version, the &quot;Tokushu Keninsha&quot; (TK, meaning &quot;Special Tractor&quot;). The Imperial Japanese Army also experimented with a variety of armored cars with limited success. The wheeled armored cars were not suitable for most operations in the puppet state of Manchukuo, due to the poor road conditions and severe winter climate.

The design of the Type 94 began in 1932. Development was given to Tokyo Gas and Electric Industry (later known as Hino Motors) in 1933, and an experimental model was completed. It was a small light tracked vehicle with a turret armed with one machine gun. For cargo transportation it pulled an ammunition trailer. After trials in both Manchukuo and Japan, the design was standardized. It was reclassified as the Type 94 (Type 2594; tankette) and was designed for reconnaissance, but could also be used for supporting infantry attacks and transporting supplies. It entered service in 1935.) The Type 94 was later superseded by the Type 97 Te-Ke tankette, which was designed as a fast reconnaissance vehicle.

Many British and American sources have confused the Type 92 &quot;cavalry tank&quot;, of which only 167 were built with the Type 94, although the Type 94 was the model almost always encountered in the various fronts of the Pacific War.

==Design==
The design of the Type 94 was inspired by the British Carden-Loyd Mark VIb tankettes. The IJA received delivery of six of these in 1930. Although the Japanese determined that both the Mark VIb and the French Renault UE were too small, they liked certain features of each of them. The design of the Type 94 had more similarities with the Vickers light tanks of the time. The hull of the Type 94 was of riveted and welded construction, with a front-mounted engine with the driver to the right. The engine was an air-cooled petrol motor that developed at 2,500 rpm. Like many Japanese armored vehicles intended to operate in hot conditions, the engine was given asbestos insulation to protect the occupants from its heat. The commander stood in a small (unpowered) turret at the rear of the hull. A large door in the rear of the hull accessed the storage compartment.

Initially, the armament was a Type 91 6.5×50mm machine gun, although later models carried a Type 92 7.7 mm machine gun. The suspension consisted of four bogies - two on each side. These were suspended by bell-cranks resisted by externally placed armored compression springs placed horizontally, one each side of the hull. Each bogie had two small rubber road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and the idler at the rear. There were two track-return rollers. In combat service the Type 94 was found to be prone to throwing its tracks in high speed turns. Further redesign work was carried out in 1937 on the suspension and the small idler was replaced by a larger diameter idler wheel suspended from a rocker arm that was now in ground contact; it did not completely solve the problem. Later models of the Type 94 had a revised suspension with the larger diameter idler wheel on a longer chassis. This increased the length of the tankette to .

===Variants===
Several variants of the Type 94 were produced. These included the Type 94 &quot;disinfecting vehicle&quot; and Type 94 &quot;gas-scattering vehicle&quot;, which were adapted for chemical warfare. Others produced were the &quot;Type 97 pole planter&quot; and &quot;Type 97 cable layer&quot;, which acted in unison. These used the Type 94 chassis, with the former vehicle first planting a telegraph pole and then the latter vehicle laying the telegraph cable.

==Operational service==
The Type 94 was mainly deployed in &quot;Tankette Companies&quot;. They were attached to infantry divisions for use in the reconnaissance role. Each Japanese division had four tankette platoons, with four tankettes in each platoon. The Type 94 tankette was an inexpensive vehicle to build, at approximately half the price of the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank, resulting in more Type 94&#x27;s entering service than any other Japanese tankette (823 units). Production included 300 units in 1935, 246 units in 1936, 200 units in 1937, 70 units in 1938, 5 units in 1939 and 2 units in 1940. The lightweight Type 94 was &quot;tailored&quot; for operating in China and proved to be effective for infantry support and reconnaissance by infantry divisions. Given the utility of the design in combat in China, the Imperial Japanese Army was content to retain the Type 94, although the design, and indeed the concept of the tankette, came to be regarded as obsolescent in Western armies.

With the start of World War II, a number of Type 94s were issued to each Japanese infantry division in the Pacific theatre, with a tracked trailer. They saw action in Burma, the Netherlands East Indies, the Philippines and on a number of islands in the South Seas Mandate. Some were also assigned to Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces. A detachment of eight Type 94 tankettes forming the 56th Infantry Group Tankette Unit (Also named the Anai tankette unit, after the name of their captain), part of the &quot;Sakaguchi Detachment&quot;, had a notable role in the Japanese conquest of Java, engaging a large enemy element on 2 March and routing them, capturing a bridge on the same night, and at dawn overrunning a position of 600 enemy soldiers on the opposite bank, and participating in offensive operations that led to the surrender of Dutch forces over the next few days near Surakarta. The Sakaguchi detachment, along with the Shoji detachment, would receive a thank you letter from their parent unit (the 16th Army) for their actions in the campaign, the only units to receive them.
In 1941, the Wang Jingwei regime&#x27;s army was given eighteen Type 94 tankettes. In 1943 ten Type 94 tankettes were given to the Manchukuo Imperial Army to form an armored company. They were still in use as late as 1945.

<doc id="466057" wikidata="Q1778572" url="?curid=466057" title="X.Org Foundation">
<text>The X.Org Foundation is a non-profit corporation chartered to research, develop, support, organize, administrate, standardize, promote, and defend a free and open accelerated graphics stack. This includes, but is not limited to, the following projects: DRM, Mesa 3D, Wayland, and the X Window System and its primary implementation, the X.Org Server.

==Organization==
The X.Org Foundation was founded on 22 January 2004.

The modern X.Org Foundation came into being when the body that oversaw X standards and published the official reference implementation joined forces with former XFree86 developers. The creation of the Foundation marked a radical change in the governance of X (see the history of the X Window System). Whereas the stewards of X since 1988 (including the previous X.Org, part of The Open Group) had been vendor organizations, the Foundation is led by software developers and using community development on the bazaar model, which relies on outside involvement. Membership is also open to individuals, with corporate membership being in the form of sponsorship.

In 2005 the X.Org Foundation applied for 501(c)(3) non-profit status. In 2012, with the help of the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC), the Foundation gained the status. In 2013, the Foundation lost the status because they did not fill a tax form (it had no income to declare and did not get any info from SFLC) and in the same year it regained the status, after clearing up the issue. In 2016, the X.Org Foundation joined Software in the Public Interest (SPI) who would manage the bureaucracy.

According to an October 2018 article published by Phoronix, freedesktop.org considered joining the X.Org Foundation.

In 2023, The X.Org Foundation decided to join Software Freedom Conservancy.

==Fields of activity==
The X.Org Foundation does not provide technical guidance, roadmaps or deadlines, releases or supervision of any kind.

The X.Org Foundation does provide communication tools (in relation with freedesktop.org), an annual physical meeting and money to help developing the free graphics stack.

* a physical annual meeting (X.Org Developer&#x27;s Conference)
* Travel sponsorship: 
* The X.Org Foundation participated as an organization of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC). This allows students to participate to X.Org-related projects over the summer .
*Endless Vacation of Code (EVoC): EVoC is a GSoC-like project, funded by the X.Org Foundation. It allows students to participate to X.Org-related projects during their vacation, at any time of the year.
* Communication: Google+ and Twitter Google+/YouTube: Store and/or link to talk videos, slides, blog articles or G+ posts related to projects under our umbrella (Martin Peres); Twitter: Mostly security issues, random updates (Alan Coopersmith).
* There is an X.Org developer guide written by Alan Coopersmith, Matt Dew and the X.Org team; edited by Bart Massey at https://www.x.org/wiki/guide/

The X.Org Foundation organizes the annual X.Org Developer&#x27;s Conference (XDC) and sponsors students to work on X.Org as part of their X.Org Endless Vacation of Code (EVoC) initiative.

The X.Org Server and xlib are the reference implementation of the X protocol, and is commonly used on Linux and UNIX; it is the fundamental technology underlying both the modern GNOME and KDE desktops and older CDE desktop environment; applications written for any of these environments can be run simultaneously.

Along with reference implementation of X protocol, the X.org Foundation hosts development of several utilities and example applications, including codice_1 on-screen calculator, codice_2 simple digital and analog clock, codice_3 text editor, codice_4 periodically updated histogram of the average system load, codice_5 terminal emulator, and codice_6 which shows, by default, a pair of eyes that follow the mouse cursor.

As of April 2013, the Board of Directors consisted of Alan Coopersmith, Alex Deucher, Martin Peres, Matt Dew, Matthias Hopf, Peter Hutterer (Secretary), Stuart Kreitman (Treasurer), and Keith Packard.

== X.Org Developer&#x27;s Conference==
The physical meeting is the X.Org Developer&#x27;s Conference (XDC/XDS), which is organized once a year, around September/October and alternates between North America and Europe and lasts for 3 days. The board of directors can cover the travel and accommodation expenses to the developers who couldn&#x27;t attend an X.Org-related conference (XDC or FOSDEM?) otherwise.

===Conference history===
== X.Org Endless Vacation of Code (EVoC)==
X.Org Endless Vacation of Code (EVoC) is a Google Summer of Code (GSoC)-like project initiated in 2008 funded by the X.Org Foundation. It allows students to participate to X.Org-related projects during their vacation, at any time of the year.

An example of an accepted EVoC project from 2014 is to work on nouveau, the free and open-source graphics device driver for GeForce-branded GPUs. NVA3/5/8 are the engineering names of the Tesla-based GT215, GT216 and GT218.

<doc id="466058" wikidata="Q1362651" url="?curid=466058" title="Type 97 Te-Ke tankette">
<text>The was a tankette used by the Imperial Japanese Army in the Second Sino-Japanese War, at Nomonhan against the Soviet Union, and in World War II. It was designed as a fast reconnaissance vehicle, and was a replacement for the earlier Type 94 tankette.

==History and development==
The origins of the Type 97 lay in a prototype diesel-engine version of the Type 94 TK developed by Hino Motors in 1936. Although the prototype had a more powerful engine and larger gun, initial trials were not successful and the Japanese Army demanded changes before acceptance. Hino responded with a modified prototype in November 1937, in which the engine was moved towards the rear of the chassis. This design was accepted and full production began in 1938. A total of 616 units were produced from 1938 to 1944 (1 unit in 1937, 56 units in 1938, 217 units in 1939, 284 units in 1940, 58 units between 1941 and 1944).

==Design==

Although the chassis was similar in appearance, the design of the Type 97 was different from the Type 94 in several significant areas. The engine was moved to the rear and the gun turret (commander position) moved to the middle of the tankette, with the driver located to the left side of the hull. This gave the two men a better position to communicate with each other. As with the Type 94, the interior was lined with heat absorbing asbestos sheets.

The main armament was the Type 94 37 mm tank gun, with 96 rounds, barrel length of 136 cm (L36.7), EL angle of fire of −15 to +20 degrees, AZ angle of fire of 20 degrees, muzzle velocity of 600 m/s, penetration of 45 mm/300 m, which was also used by Type 95 Ha-Go. However, due to shortages in the production of this weapon, many vehicles were fitted with a 7.7 mm Type 97 machine gun instead.

The Type 97 replaced the Type 94 on the assembly line in 1939, it was primarily assigned to reconnaissance regiments, and, as with US Army tanks prior to 1941, it was not designed to engage enemy tanks. Because it was a reconnaissance vehicle, built for speed, and not direct combat, its hull and turret were designed for only two crewmen; leaving the tankette commander to load and fire the main gun. As with most tankettes, it was severely deficient in armor protection, and was prey for any &quot;anti-tank weapon&quot;.

==Variants==

Several variants of the Type 97 were produced. The Type 98 So-Da APC was designed for use as an armored personnel and ammunition carrier. Production of the vehicle began in 1941. The Type 100 Te-Re was designed for use as an artillery observation vehicle. It went into production in 1940.

Another variant saw the Type 97 modified into the prototype Ki-To SPAAG. The Type 97 turret was removed and a single Type 98 20 mm autocannon was mounted on the chassis. There was no protective gun shield for the crew. The chassis was elongated with an extra road-wheel on each side. It did not enter production.

In addition, the Type 97 disinfecting vehicle and Type 97 gas scattering vehicle were produced. They were based on the Type 97 Te-Ke chassis, but had a Type 94 tankette turret. The Type 97 Te-Ke was modified and used as a &quot;tractor&quot;; closed for protection against the chemical agents. It would pull either a configured independent tracked mobile liquid dissemination chemical vehicle or a respective tracked mobile disinfecting anti-chemical agents vehicle. They operated in the same way as its predecessors, the Type 94 disinfecting vehicle and Type 94 gas scattering vehicle.

==Operational history==
Typically, Type 97s were distributed to support infantry divisions, where they were very often used as armored tractors, supply vehicles, and for recon/scouting.

The Type 97 was successfully fielded in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1938–1945, as the Chinese National Revolutionary Army had only three tank battalions, which themselves consisted of some Italian &quot;CV33&quot; tankettes. Their light weight enabled them to be transported easily across the sea or rivers. The Type 97 tankettes first real test of combat came during the Battle of Nomonhan during the months of May through August in 1939 against the Red Army of the Soviet Union. Although not designed for such combat, the 97 tankette went up against Russian anti-tank guns and 45mm high velocity guns of the Soviet BT-5 and BT-7 light tanks. The Japanese tank force in which they were included was decimated.

With the start of World War II, the Type 97 contributed to the Japanese victories at the Battle of Malaya and the Battle of the Philippines, as its light weight enabled the tank to traverse unsupported bridges and ferry crossing that would be unable to take heavier tanks, and its small size allowed it to travel along the long winding and narrow roads in the area.

After the end of World War II, Type 97 tankettes that were stationed in Dutch East Indies was used by the Indonesian Army during the Indonesian National Revolution.

<text>Domenico Salvatori (27 September 1855 – 11 December 1909) along with Alessandro Moreschi, Domenico Mustafà and Giovanni Cesari, was one of the famous castrati singers of the late 19th century.

Born in Anagni, he first started as a contralto at the Cappella Giulia which he later abandoned in order to enter as a now soprano or mezzo to the Sistine Chapel Choir. He later became secretary of the choir for some years, holding his position as a secretary also under the direction of Lorenzo Perosi. A good friend of Alessandro Moreschi, together they often used to visit their contemporary Domenico Mustafà in his retirement. Salvatori died in Rome. He is buried in the Monumental Cimitero di Campo Verano in Alessandro Moreschi&#x27;s tomb. He recorded, along with Giovanni Cesari and Vincenzo Sebastianelli, a few phonograph recordings together with Alessandro Moreschi; but these were only pure choral pieces, and none of them were solo. It is, however, possible to hear him clearly as the contralto voice audible in a SATB quartet recording of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina&#x27;s &quot;La cruda mia nemica&quot; (with Moreschi as soprano).

<text>Richard Euringer (April 4, 1891 – August 29, 1953) was a German writer. Although active starting in the 1920s, he is best known for his later career, in which he was a supporter of the Nazis. His best-known work is probably &quot;Als Flieger in zwei Kriegen&quot;, published in 1941 by Philipp Reclam Jr. of Leipzig. From 1950 he published under the pseudonym Florian Ammer.

Euringer was born in Augsburg, where he attended Gymnasium. He then became a soldier and officer, and in World War I enlisted as a pilot, serving time on the western front from 1914 to 1916. He fought alongside the Turks in Syria and later took up the position of commander of the Flying School at Lechfeld, Bavaria. In the turbulent years after the war, he was perturbed and roved around, becoming in the process one of the earliest members of the NSDAP. After the war he took up writing, and published several books. Of the numerous novels he wrote, some carry undertones of his war experiences. Some of his most acclaimed works were Fliegerschule 4 (1929), Vortrupp Pascha (1937), Der Zug durch die Wüste (1938), Die Arbeitslosen (1930), and Die Fürsten fallen (1935).

Starting in 1931, he became a political-cultural correspondent for the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;, a Nazi newspaper. In 1933, his work &quot;Deutsche Passion&quot; attracted the attention of Joseph Goebbels, gaining him for the first time national attention. In 1933, he also became a director of the libraries in Essen. In this capacity, he identified 18,000 works deemed not to correspond with Nazi ideology, which were publicly burned as a result. In 1934 he became a member of the advisory boards for writing and broadcasting in the &quot;Reich&quot;. After 1936, he worked as a freelance writer.

<text>Antonia Mercé y Luque (September 4, 1890 – July 18, 1936), also known as La Argentina, was an Argentine-born Spanish dancer who created the neoclassical style of Spanish dance. She was widely regarded as one of the most famous Spanish dancers of the 20th century and was nicknamed the &quot;Queen of the Castanets&quot; and the &quot;Flamenco Pavlova&quot;.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Antonia Mercé y Luque, known by her stage name La Argentina, was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to professional Spanish dancers Manuel Mercé and Josefina Luque. At the age of four, she began her dance career in ballet, primarily trained by her father. She made her debut performance at the Teatro Real in Madrid, Spain, at the age of nine, and became a star dancer at the Madrid Opera by the age of eleven. After the death of her father, La Argentina retired from ballet and began studying native Spanish dances with her mother at the age of 14.

=== Career ===
At the beginning of her career, La Argentina faced disapproval in her dancing style from society, which prevented her from performing in theaters and concerts. She performed in venues accessible to her, such as café cantantés and music halls.

Before World War I, La Argentina traveled to Paris, where she performed at various prominent locations like the Moulin Rouge and the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. Later on, she developed an interest in a Romani-style dance and adapted it into her own style. Her rendition of this dance inspired Metropolitan Opera star Rosa Ponselle to prepare the dances for her portrayal of Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; under La Argentina&#x27;s guidance in 1935.

Throughout her career, La Argentina embarked on six tours in North America, often accompanied by flamenco guitarist Carlos Montoya.

=== Death ===
On July 18, 1936, La Argentina passed away at the age of 46 in Bayonne, France.

==Awards==
La Argentina was recognized for her contributions to dance with several prestigious awards. She was awarded the French Légion d&#x27;honneur and the Spanish Orden de Isabel la Católica. Following her death, she was &quot;honored with a plaque at the Metropolitan Opera House, in addition to receiving the medals of Alfonso X the Wise and the Order of Isabella the Catholic.&quot;

== Contribution to formal dance ==
La Argentina&#x27;s contributions to formal dance include her unique style, music selection, use of castanets, and the way she structured her performances.

=== Style ===
Edwige Feuillère expressed her admiration for La Argentina&#x27;s classical formation, knowledge, and taste, which brought dignity and nobleness to Spanish folklore. Serge Lifar acknowledged La Argentina&#x27;s contribution to the history of formal dance, which began in 1920 with her and Vicente Escudero, according to him. La Argentina created her own style by reviving forgotten traditions and seeking out traditional steps from village squares and humble dance schools. She refined and pruned each pattern of steps, keeping only what was essential to conform to her own aesthetic, which combined the purity of classical style with the ardor and character of popular art. La Argentina believed that stylized dance should retain the nature and flavor of folklore while respecting the demands of the stage, such as creating space, accentuating movement, and fitting different parts into the whole.

=== Music ===
La Argentina incorporated music from contemporary Spanish composers such as Isaac Albéniz, de Falla, Granados, and Turina into her Spanish dance performances. These composers&#x27; music demanded broad choral movements that were not present in traditional folkloric dances. She also worked with young Spanish composers, including Ernesto Halffter, Óscar Esplá, and Duran, to create new scores. Accompanied by notable pianists such as Joaquin Nin, Amparo Navaro, Carmencita Perez, Miguel Berdion, and Luis Galve. La Argentina used a variety of music that suited her performances.

==== Castanets ====
La Argentina started using castanets at a very young age, around three or four. Later on, she developed her own method to obtain more pleasing sounds from the instrument and even modified the design of castanets. Her approach to playing the castanets was so influential that many other Spanish artists began to adopt her musical notation for this instrument.

===Recital format===
Argentina was a pioneer in the recital format, performing her own choreography for concerts with only a pianist or occasionally a guitarist. Salvador Ballesteros, a family friend, served as her guitarist throughout her career. She gradually transitioned from performing in variety programs and pieces with orchestral music to dances where less importance was given to the orchestra. Her first shows in 1925 were during a European tour and performed in the South of France, where she shared the stage with other artists. Her first solo recital was in Berlin in 1926, and she continued performing in the same format in various venues around the world, including Salle Gaveau, Théâtre Femina, Salle Pleyel, the Imperial Theatre in Tokyo, Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, Paris Opera, Opéra-Comique, and the old Trocadéro. Her popular shows at the Trocadéro drew large crowds, and she continued to perform there to great acclaim.

Also in 1927, a flamenco cuadro called &quot;Au coeur de Seville&quot; was performed, featuring a popular air.

Ernesto Halffter composed the music for Sonatine in 1928. Argentina danced in this ballet, which mixed elements of Old France and Castilla and featured a shepherdess gliding and pirouetting imperceptibly.

In 1928, Óscar Esplá composed the music for Le Contrebandier, a ballet featuring the future Empress Eugénie and the countess of Teba.

Juerga, choreographed in 1928 by Julien Bautista, depicted scenes of popular life in Madrid around 1885, with young people from good families mingling with common folk and engaging in unrestrained jollity.

Triana, composed by Albeniz in 1929, depicted lovers&#x27; tiffs during the Corpus Christi festival in Sevilla.

<text>Scott Douglas &quot;Scooter&quot; Altman (born August 15, 1959) is a retired United States Navy Captain and naval aviator, engineer, test pilot and former NASA astronaut. He is a veteran of four Space Shuttle missions. His fourth mission on STS-125 was the last servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. As of November 2022, he is the president of the Space operating group for ASRC Federal.

==Personal life==
Altman was born in Lincoln, Illinois. He is married to the former Jill Shannon Loomer of Tucson, Arizona and has three children, the second oldest of whom graduated Rice University in Houston, Texas in May 2009. He is a resident of Pekin, Illinois, along with his parents, Fred and Sharon Altman. The Pekin District 108 school board voted to honor the former astronaut by naming Scott Altman Primary School in 2010. Scott&#x27;s sister Sarah Beardsley is the publisher of Venus Zine, a women&#x27;s music, DIY and culture multi-media company. He is a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

==Education==
* 1977: Graduated from Pekin Community High School, Pekin, Illinois
* 1981: Received Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from the University of Illinois, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity
* 1990: Received Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School

==Military career==
After being rejected from the United States Air Force for being too tall, Altman instead enlisted in the United States Navy. He was commissioned as an ensign in August 1981, and received his Naval Aviator wings in February 1983. As a member of Fighter Squadron 51 at (then) NAS Miramar, Altman completed two deployments to the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean flying the F-14A Tomcat from the USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;. In August 1987, he was selected for the Naval Postgraduate School-Test Pilot School Co-op program and graduated with Test Pilot School Class 97 in June 1990 as a Distinguished Graduate. After graduation, he spent the next two years as a test pilot working on various F-14 projects at Strike Aircraft Test Directorate NAWC AD Patuxent River Maryland. Altman then took the new F-14D on its first operational deployment with VF-31 Tomcatters, where he served as maintenance officer and later operations officer. He was awarded the Air Medal for his role as a strike leader flying over Southern Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch. Shortly following his return from this six-month deployment, he was selected for the NASA astronaut program. He has logged over 7,000 flight hours in more than 40 types of aircraft. During his Navy service, Altman had the callsigns &quot;Scooter&quot; and &quot;D-Bear&quot;.

===Involvement in &quot;Top Gun&quot; film===
Altman performed many of the aerial stunts in the 1986 film &quot;Top Gun&quot;, most notably in the scene where Tom Cruise&#x27;s character, Maverick, &quot;flips the bird&quot; at the enemy MiG pilot (played by Robert F. Willard).

In a NASA interview prior to his 2000 spaceflight, Scott Altman commented on his role as an F-14 pilot involved in the filming of &quot;Top Gun&quot;: 

==NASA career==
Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in December 1994, Altman reported to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in March 1995. He completed a year of training and was initially assigned to work technical aspects of orbiter landing and roll out issues for the Astronaut Office Vehicle Systems Branch. He was the pilot on STS-90 (1998) and STS-106 (2000), and was the mission commander on STS-109 (2002) and STS-125 (2009). A veteran of four space flights, Altman has logged over 40 days in space. Altman retired from NASA in September 2010 to join ASRC Federal Research and Technology Solutions in Greenbelt, Maryland.

===Spaceflights===
STS-90 Neurolab (April 17 to May 3, 1998). During the 16-day Spacelab flight the seven person crew aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; served as both experiment subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system.

STS-106 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (September 8–20, 2000). During the 12-day mission, the crew successfully prepared the International Space Station for the arrival of the first permanent crew. Additionally, he handflew two complete flyarounds of the station after undocking.

STS-109 &quot;Columbia&quot; (March 1–12, 2002). STS-109 was the fourth Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission. The STS-109 crew successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope leaving it with a new power unit, a new camera and new solar arrays. HST servicing and upgrade was accomplished by four crewmembers during a total of 5 EVAs in 5 consecutive days. The space walkers were assisted by crewmates inside Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times, and covered 3.9 million miles in over 262 hours, culminating in a night landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida.
STS-125 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (May 11–24, 2009). STS-125 was the fifth and final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. &quot;Atlantis&quot; carried two new instruments to the telescope, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and the Wide Field Camera 3. The mission also replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor, six gyroscopes, and two battery unit modules to allow the telescope to continue to function at least through 2014. The crew also installed new thermal blanket insulating panels to provide improved thermal protection, and a soft-capture mechanism that would aid in the safe de-orbiting of the telescope by an uncrewed spacecraft at the end of its operational lifespan. The mission also carried an IMAX camera and the crew documented the progress of the mission for an upcoming IMAX film.

<doc id="466087" wikidata="Q3625552" url="?curid=466087" title="Apostolic Assembly of the Faith in Christ Jesus">
<text>The Apostolic Assembly of the Faith in Christ Jesus (AAFCJ) is a Oneness Pentecostal denomination in the United States. It was founded in 1925 and incorporated in California on March 15, 1930, and is currently headquartered in Fontana, California.

== History ==

The AAFCJ emerged out of the Pentecostal movement that began with the Azusa Street Revival in the city of Los Angeles in 1906. Juan Navarro, a participant of that revival, baptized Francisco Llorente in 1912, who later was elected the first Bishop President of the Apostolic Assembly when it formed in 1925. The organization became a California corporation on March 15, 1930.

Regarded as one of football&#x27;s greatest goalkeepers, he was nicknamed &quot;Die Katze von Anzing&quot; (&quot;the cat from Anzing&quot;) for his fast reflexes, agility, flexibility, speed, and consistency. With 709 matches played across seventeen seasons, he was Bayern&#x27;s all-time record appearance holder, until he was surpassed by Thomas Müller in 2024.

In addition to his shot-stopping ability, Maier was also known for his ability to dominate his box, as well as his sense of humour and personality throughout his career, which made him a fan favourite. Regarding his playing style, he once quipped &quot;a keeper should give off a sense of calm, and not fall asleep while doing so.&quot;

==Club career==
Born in Metten, Bavaria, Maier spent his entire professional career at Bayern Munich. He began playing for Bayern&#x27;s youth sides in 1958. During the 1970s, he was part of the legendary Bayern team which included the likes of Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Müller which won four West German league titles, three German cups, and three consecutive European Cups (1974 defeating Atlético Madrid, 1975 defeating Leeds United, 1976 defeating AS Saint-Étienne). He had previously tasted success in Europe in 1967 when Bayern won the European Cup Winners Cup, defeating Rangers F.C. in the final in extra time. In the five games of the four European finals, the 1974 title having been won in a replay, Maier allowed a total of one goal.

Maier was elected German Footballer of the Year in 1975, 1977, and 1978. Between 1966 and 1979 he played in 442 consecutive Bundesliga matches, still a German national record.

On 14 July 1979, Maier suffered serious injuries in a self-inflicted traffic accident. While aquaplaning, he veered out of his lane and collided with an oncoming car, resulting in minor injuries to two women. Initially admitted to the district hospital over the weekend, medical staff there failed to recognize the extent of his injuries, diagnosing only a few rib fractures. However, through his friend Uli Hoeneß, newly appointed as Bayern manager, Maier was connected with the Bayern club doctor. Upon the doctor&#x27;s recommendation, Maier was transferred to Großhadern hospital, where X-rays revealed a ruptured lung, a displaced liver, a torn diaphragm, and a collection of two and a half liters of blood in his abdominal cavity. An emergency surgery at Großhadern saved Maier&#x27;s life. He started training again on 26 November 1979, but then had to end his career, having missed the entire 1979–80 season.

==International career==

Maier was selected in the West Germany squad for four consecutive World Cups. In 1966 in England, he was a non-playing deputy to Hans Tilkowski. At the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, he was the starter and played all games (including the 4–3 semifinal loss to Italy after extra time) except the third-place match.

In the 1974 FIFA World Cup on home soil, at the top of his footballing abilities, he reached the peak of his international career as the Germans went all the way to the final with a legendary team that included the likes of Franz Beckenbauer, Berti Vogts, Gerd Müller and Paul Breitner. The greatest triumph came when the hosts defeated a Johan Cruyff-led Netherlands team 2–1 in the final in Maier&#x27;s own hometown Munich.

Four years later at the World Cup in Argentina, slightly past his peak but still formidable, Maier delivered a strong performance but could not prevent his side&#x27;s failing to advance past the second round. Maier also won the 1972 European Championship with West Germany and reached the final in 1976, losing to Czechoslovakia on penalty kicks. On this occasion he was on the receiving end of the original Panenka penalty. In all, he earned 95 caps for his country.

==Post-playing career==
Maier went into coaching for both club and country and mentored Oliver Kahn. In October 2004 his contract with the national side was terminated by manager Jürgen Klinsmann after Maier spoke out in favour of Kahn over Arsenal&#x27;s Jens Lehmann in a dispute over who should be the side&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper. He continued to work as head goalkeeping coach for Bayern and retired in 2008.

==Personal life==
Besides his goalkeeping exploits, Maier was famous for his overlong shorts and being the first goalkeeper to wear the now-standard, outsize, &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; gloves, as well as his sense of humour. He is remembered for an incident where he became bored during a match at the Olympiastadion as the opposing side had yet to threaten his goal. A duck wandered onto the pitch and Maier attempted to catch it.

In June 2009, Maier was honoured by the Bavarian government with the Life Achievement Award.

<doc id="466094" wikidata="Q267178" url="?curid=466094" title="Geoffrey Studdert Kennedy">
<text>Geoffrey Anketell Studdert Kennedy (27 June 1883 – 8 March 1929) was an English Anglican priest and poet. He was nicknamed &quot;Woodbine Willie&quot; during World War I for giving Woodbine cigarettes to the soldiers he met, as well as spiritual aid to injured and dying soldiers.

==Early life==
Born in Leeds, England, on 27 June 1883, Studdert Kennedy was the seventh of nine children born to Jeanette Anketell and William Studdert Kennedy, vicar of St Mary&#x27;s, Quarry Hill in Leeds. His father William Studdert Kennedy was born in Blackrock, County Dublin, Ireland, in 1826. Geoffrey&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Robert Mitchell Kennedy, was Dean of Clonfert in County Galway, Ireland from 1850 until his death in 1864. One of Geoffrey&#x27;s brothers was Hugh A. Studdert Kennedy, a biographer of American religious leader Mary Baker Eddy.

Because of his Irish forefathers, Geoffrey always maintained he was an Irishman. He was educated at Leeds Grammar School and Trinity College, Dublin, where he gained a degree in classics and divinity in 1904. After a year&#x27;s training at Ripon Clergy College, he became a curate at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Rugby, and then, in 1914, the vicar of St. Paul&#x27;s, Worcester.

==Military career==
On the outbreak of World War I, Studdert Kennedy volunteered as a chaplain to the army on the Western Front, where he gained the nickname &quot;Woodbine Willie&quot;. In 1917, he was awarded the Military Cross at Messines Ridge after running into no man&#x27;s land to help the wounded during an attack on the German frontline.

During the war he supported the British military effort with enthusiasm. Attached to a bayonet-training service, chaplain Kennedy toured with boxers and wrestlers to give morale-boosting speeches about the usefulness of the bayonet. One of his inspirational speeches is vividly described by A. S. Bullock as &quot;the most extraordinary talk I ever heard&#x27;. Bullock notes that the listeners &#x27;were a very rough, tough lot, but they sat spellbound&quot;, and quotes a section of the speech, at the end of which &quot;everybody sprang to their feet and cheered him to the echo&quot;.

He wrote a number of poems about his experiences, and these appeared in the books &quot;Rough Rhymes of a Padre&quot; (1918), and &quot;More Rough Rhymes&quot; (1919), among others.

An anthology of his works was published under the title &quot;The Unutterable Beauty&quot;.

==Later life==
After the war, Studdert Kennedy was given charge of St Edmund, King and Martyr in Lombard Street, London. Having been converted to Christian socialism and pacifism during the war, he wrote &quot;Lies&quot; (1919), &quot;Democracy and the Dog-Collar&quot; (1921) (featuring such chapters as &quot;The Church Is Not a Movement but a Mob&quot;, &quot;Capitalism is Nothing But Greed, Grab, and Profit-Mongering&quot; and &quot;So-Called Religious Education Worse than Useless&quot;), &quot;Food for the Fed Up&quot; (1921), &quot;The Wicket Gate&quot; (1923), and &quot;The Word and the Work&quot; (1925). He moved to work for the Industrial Christian Fellowship, for whom he went on speaking tours of Britain.

His appointment as missioner for ICF released him from routine clerical duties to become an outspoken advocate for the working classes. One of his celebrated quotes was: &quot;If finding God in our churches leads to us losing Him in our factories, then better we tear down those churches for God must hate the sight of them.&quot;

It was on one of these tours that he was taken ill with the flu, which was complicated by his weak lungs. He died in Liverpool on 8 March 1929, exhausted at the age of 45. The Dean of Westminster refused burial at Westminster Abbey, because he said Studdert Kennedy was a &quot;socialist&quot;, even though he had distrusted most politicians and had refused to join any political party. His funeral took place in Worcester, to which First World War veterans and poor working people flocked to pay their respects. 

==Honours and legacy==
===Honours===
Studdert Kennedy was awarded the Military Cross (MC) during World War I. His citation read:
The Museum of Army Chaplaincy at Amport House, Hampshire, also honours Kennedy with a large display about his life. In February 2013, John Packer, Bishop of Ripon and Leeds unveiled a commemorative plaque in Ripon, North Yorkshire, to honour the Ripon Clergy College and Studdert Kennedy.

Studdert Kennedy is commemorated with a feast day (Commemoration) on the liturgical calendar of the Church of England on 8 March.

===Legacy===
He wrote the poem &quot;Roses in December&quot;, which J.M. Barrie quoted in his rectorial address to the University of St. Andrews entitled &quot;Courage&quot; in 1922, and often misattributed to Barrie.

&quot;War! Lies! And a Packet of Fags!&quot; is a play by David Gooderson about the Great War and its aftermath—the story of &quot;Woodbine Willie&quot;.

He is mentioned in the Divine Comedy song &quot;Absent Friends&quot;: &quot;Woodbine Willie couldn&#x27;t rest until he&#x27;d/given every bloke a final smoke/before the killing,&quot; and in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; by Irish author James Joyce: &quot;tsingirillies&#x27; zyngarettes, while Woodbine Willie, so popiular with the poppyrossies&quot; (351).

Venerable Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen quoted Studdert Kennedy&#x27;s 1918 poem &quot;Indifference&quot; (from the collection called &quot;Rough Rhymes of a Padre&quot;) when Sheen spoke publicly about the need for enthusiasm in all of one&#x27;s life. Studdert Kennedy &quot;wrote this poem during what was called ‘the great disillusion’ of the 1920s&quot;. Sheen&#x27;s point was that the &quot;world is suffering from indifference&quot; as &quot;apathy, not caring.&quot; Sheen noted that he wondered if Jesus Christ &quot;did not suffer more from our indifference than he did from the crucifixion.&quot; To make his point he recited Studdert Kennedy&#x27;s poem &quot;Indifference.&quot;

His son was the psychologist and linguist Michael Studdert-Kennedy.

<text>An active filter is a type of analog circuit implementing an electronic filter using active components, typically an amplifier. Amplifiers included in a filter design can be used to improve the cost, performance and predictability of a filter.

An amplifier prevents the load impedance of the following stage from affecting the characteristics of the filter. An active filter can have complex poles and zeros without using a bulky or expensive inductor. The shape of the response, the Q (quality factor), and the tuned frequency can often be set with inexpensive variable resistors. In some active filter circuits, one parameter can be adjusted without affecting the others.

== Types ==

Using active elements has some limitations. Basic filter design equations neglect the finite bandwidth of amplifiers. Available active devices have limited bandwidth, so they are often impractical at high frequencies. Amplifiers consume power and inject noise into a system. Certain circuit topologies may be impractical if no DC path is provided for bias current to the amplifier elements. Power handling capability is limited by the amplifier stages.

Active filter circuit configurations (electronic filter topology) include:
* Sallen-Key, and VCVS filters (low sensitivity to component tolerance)
* State variable filters and biquadratic or biquad filters
* Dual amplifier bandpass (DABP)
* Wien notch
* Multiple feedback filters
* Fliege (lowest component count for 2 opamp but with good controllability over frequency and type)
* Akerberg Mossberg (one of the topologies that offer complete and independent control over gain, frequency, and type)

Active filters can implement the same transfer functions as passive filters. Common transfer functions are:
* High-pass filter – attenuation of frequencies below their cut-off points.
* Low-pass filter – attenuation of frequencies above their cut-off points.
* Band-pass filter – attenuation of frequencies both above and below those they allow to pass.
* Band-stop filter (Notch filter) – attenuation of certain frequencies while allowing all others to pass.
:Combinations are possible, such as notch and high-pass (in a rumble filter where most of the offending rumble comes from a particular frequency). Another example is an elliptic filter.

==Design of active filters==

To design filters, the specifications that need to be established include:

* The range of desired frequencies (the passband) together with the shape of the frequency response. This indicates the variety of filter (see above) and the center or corner frequencies.
* Input and output impedance requirements. These limit the circuit topologies available; for example, most, but not all active filter topologies provide a buffered (low impedance) output. However, remember that the internal output impedance of operational amplifiers, if used, may rise markedly at high frequencies and reduce the attenuation from that expected. Be aware that some high-pass filter topologies present the input with almost a short circuit to high frequencies.
* Dynamic range of the active elements. The amplifier should not saturate (run into the power supply rails) at expected input signals, nor should it be operated at such low amplitudes that noise dominates.
* The degree to which unwanted signals should be rejected.
** In the case of narrow-band bandpass filters, the Q determines the -3 dB bandwidth but also the degree of rejection of frequencies far removed from the center frequency; if these two requirements are in conflict then a staggered-tuning bandpass filter may be needed.
** For notch filters, the degree to which unwanted signals at the notch frequency must be rejected determines the accuracy of the components, but not the Q, which is governed by desired steepness of the notch, i.e. the bandwidth around the notch before attenuation becomes small.
** For high-pass and low-pass (as well as band-pass filters far from the center frequency), the required rejection may determine the slope of attenuation needed, and thus the &quot;order&quot; of the filter. A second-order all-pole filter gives an ultimate slope of about 12 dB per octave (40 dB/decade), but the slope close to the corner frequency is much less, sometimes necessitating a notch be added to the filter.
* The allowable &quot;ripple&quot; (variation from a flat response, in decibels) within the passband of high-pass and low-pass filters, along with the shape of the frequency response curve near the corner frequency, determine the damping ratio or damping factor (= 1/(2Q)). This also affects the phase response, and the time response to a square-wave input. Several important response shapes (damping ratios) have well-known names:
** Chebyshev filter – peaking/ripple in the passband before the corner; Q&gt;0.7071 for 2nd-order filters.
** Butterworth filter – maximally flat amplitude response; Q=0.7071 for 2nd-order filters
** Legendre–Papoulis filter – trades off some flatness in the passband, though still monotonic, for a steeper fall-off
** Linkwitz–Riley filter – desirable properties for audio crossover applications, fastest rise time with no overshoot; Q = 0.5 (critically damped)
** Paynter or transitional Thompson-Butterworth or &quot;compromise&quot; filter – faster fall-off than Bessel; Q=0.639 for 2nd-order filters
** Bessel filter – maximally flat group delay; Q=0.577 for 2nd-order filters. It provides good linear phase.
** Elliptic filter or Cauer filter – add a notch (or &quot;zero&quot;) just outside the passband, to give a much greater slope in this region than the combination of order and damping ratio &quot;without&quot; the notch. The output is similar to the ideal filter(i.e., good flat response of both pass band and the stop band).

=== Comparison to passive filters ===
An active filter can have gain, increasing the power available in a signal compared to the input. Passive filters dissipate energy from a signal and cannot have a net power gain. For some ranges of frequencies, for example at audio frequencies and below, an active filter can realize a given transfer function without using inductors, which are relatively large and costly components compared to resistors and capacitors, and which are more expensive to make with the required high quality and accurate values. This advantage may not be as important for active filters entirely integrated on a chip because the available capacitors have relatively low values and so require high value resistors which take up area of the integrated circuit. Active filters have good isolation between stages, and can provide high input impedance and low output impedance; this makes their characteristics independent of the source and load impedances. Multiple stages can be cascaded when desired to improve characteristics. In contrast, design of multiple-stage passive filters must take into account each stage&#x27;s frequency-dependent loading of the preceding stage. It is feasible to make active filters tunable over a wide range, compared with passive filters. Since inductors are not used, filters can be made in a very compact size and do not produce or interact with magnetic fields that may be present. 

Compared with active filters, passive filters require no additional power supplies. The amplifying devices of an active filter must provide predictable gain and performance over the entire frequency range to be processed; the gain–bandwidth product of the amplifier will constrain the maximum frequency that can be used.

<doc id="466100" wikidata="Q1061937" url="?curid=466100" title="Shin Megami Tensei (video game)">
<text>Shin Megami Tensei is a role-playing video game developed and published by Atlus for the Super Famicom. Originally released in 1992 in Japan, it has been ported to multiple systems and eventually released in the West for iOS in 2014. It was released on the Virtual Console service in Japan on Wii in 2007 and on Wii U in 2013, as well as Nintendo Switch Online in 2020. It is the third game in the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series and the first in the central &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; series. The gameplay uses first-person navigation of dungeons and turn-based battles against demons. The player can recruit demons as allies by talking to them rather than fighting them, and two to three demons can be fused to create new demons.

The story follows a player-named protagonist who lives in near-future Tokyo. When a portal to the realm of demons is opened accidentally by a scientist named Steven and is seized by Gotou, a military commander who believes that he can control the demons, the United States government orders a nuclear attack on Tokyo. Transported with two other supporting characters thirty years into the future, the protagonist finds the Earth ruined by a demon invasion, which is now the stage for an escalating conflict between the Order of Messiah and the Ring of Gaia, conflicting cults who wish to bring about kingdoms for their respective patron deities (YHVH and Lucifer). The story is influenced by moral decisions the protagonist makes, aligning him either with the Messians, the Ring of Gaia, or setting him up as an independent agent.

From the start of the production, Atlus staff saw &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; as a chance to create a game with the company&#x27;s brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the previous &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; game; because of this, they knew what was going to happen in the story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff&#x27;s personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Critical and commercial reception for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series.

==Gameplay==

In &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;, players take the role of an unnamed protagonist, a teenage boy who can communicate with demons using a computer program. The gameplay is similar to that of other games in the series: players make their way through dungeons and fight against demons in a first-person perspective. The protagonist uses a variety of weapons and items, with the primary weapons being swords and guns. Such items are bought from merchants scattered around the world map. In special areas, the protagonist can use the in-game currency to restore health and magic points for themselves and their demons, remove status ailments, and revive fallen demons. Special Terminals scattered across the world map allow the player to save their game, and they can use them to teleport between terminals in different areas of Tokyo.

Battles are turn-based, and consist of players letting the characters in their party attack with swords or guns, summon demons, or cast magic spells; both demons and humans, with the exception of the player character, are able to use magic. By participating in battles, human characters in the player&#x27;s party receive experience points; by accumulating these points, the characters&#x27; levels rise and new abilities are randomly learned. Players can choose to talk to demons instead of fighting them; they can ask the demons for items or money, try to get them to go away, or try to form an alliance with them. At some places, called &quot;Cathedrals of Shadows&quot;, players can fuse two to three allied demons into one single, more powerful demon; as demons do not receive experience points, this is the only way for the player to increase their demons&#x27; power. Magnetite is used as a fuel for allied demons, and is used up by summoned demons as the player character walks around in the dungeons; if players run out of magnetite, summoned demons take damage.

The way demons behave is based on their and the protagonist&#x27;s respective alignments. Alignments come in two types, Light-Neutral-Dark, and Law-Neutral-Chaos. A demon&#x27;s alignment can range across both alignments, resulting in nine possible stances that affect how they behave and what actions in battle or story progression pleases them. The protagonist&#x27;s alignment changes depending on choices made during the story, and in response the attitudes of people and demons change; for instance, demons who are law-aligned will refuse to form an alliance with chaos-aligned players. Additionally, depending on their alignment, players will not be let into certain areas; for instance, the Order of Messiah will not let chaos-aligned players into their churches.

== Synopsis ==
===Setting and characters===
&quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; takes place in a near future Tokyo, first in the year &quot;199X&quot;, and then 30 years later in a post-apocalyptic version of the city. A rift has been opened to another world, allowing demons to invade Tokyo; by using a computer program, humans are able to communicate with and summon the demons. Across the story, moral alignments are portrayed in various ways: alongside the middle &quot;neutral&quot; pathway, the &quot;law&quot; faction believes in establishing a logical order at the expense of feeling and freedom, while the &quot;chaos&quot; faction espouses unlimited freedom for the individual while discarding the weak.

The game includes four nameable human &quot;heroes&quot;: the player character, the Hero, who is a teenage boy living with his mother in Kichijōji in Tokyo; the Heroine, who is the leader of a resistance force which tries to protect Tokyo; and the Law Hero and Chaos Hero, who represent the alignments &quot;law&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot;, respectively. Among other characters are ambassador and general , who lead the United States military and the Japan Self-Defense Forces, respectively; the archangel and the demon , who lead the Order of Messiah and the Ring of Gaea, respectively; the demons and , who use the pseudonyms and ; and Stephen, the creator of the demon summoning program.

===Plot===
The game begins with the Hero dreaming that he meets the Law Hero, the Chaos Hero, and a woman named Yuriko; she promises that she will become the Hero&#x27;s partner. He wakes up, and receives an e-mail with a computer program for summoning demons attached. While out on an errand, he learns that a scientist has opened a portal to the Expanse, which allows demons to enter Tokyo. He also meets Yuriko, who says she will fulfill her promise. The next night, the Hero again dreams that he meets the Law Hero and Chaos Hero, and that they save the Heroine from a sacrificial ritual. The next day, he meets the Law Hero and Chaos Hero in reality; they reveal that they had the same dreams. News of the demons spread, and the US military, led by ambassador Thorman, decides to intervene. The Japan Self-Defense Forces, led by general Gotou, opposes them, as they see demons as the ancient spirits of the land. A third group, led by the Heroine, tries to prevent conflict between the other two. She gets captured by Gotou&#x27;s forces; they are about to publicly execute her under supervision by Yuriko, but she is saved by the Hero, Law Hero, and Chaos Hero. The Hero can choose to support Thorman or Gotou, or to reject both; regardless of his choice, the conflict escalates until Thorman launches missiles towards Tokyo. The Heroine is killed, but saves the Hero, Law Hero, and Chaos Hero by using magic to teleport them to another plane of existence.

When they return to Tokyo, thirty years have passed, and the world lies in ruins. Both demons and humans live in Tokyo, and two warring groups have formed: the Order of Messiah, who is building a cathedral and wants to bring about the Thousand-Year Kingdom, and the Ring of Gaea, who intends to summon Lucifer and wants freedom. While exploring the city, the Chaos Hero fuses himself with a demon to gain power, and decides to leave to pursue his own ideals; the group moves on without him and meet the Heroine, who has been reincarnated and rejoins them. Soon afterwards, the Law Hero&#x27;s soul gets taken by an attacking demon. The Chaos Hero joins the Ring of Gaea, while the Law Hero&#x27;s soul gets reincarnated as the new Messiah. Both try to get the Hero to join their respective side; he can choose to support either, or to reject both. Regardless of what he chooses, the Order of Messiah finishes building their cathedral, and a great flood appears, drowning people who were not inside the cathedral at the time. Survivors set up camps inside the cathedral; the Order of Messiah takes control of the top floors, while the Ring of Gaea occupies the basement floors.

After this point, the story continues differently depending on the Hero&#x27;s alignment.

* If it is &quot;law&quot;, the Law Hero is killed in a battle with the Chaos Hero, while the Hero and the Heroine go to the basement. On their way they have to kill the Chaos Hero and fight Yuriko, who turns out to be the demon Lilith in disguise; she says that she and the Hero were supposed to be the new Adam and Eve and that she wanted to create a new age and live with him forever, which is why she tried to execute the Heroine. After defeating her in battle, the Hero and the Heroine reach the basement and kill the demon Asura-ou; they then go to the cathedral&#x27;s roof, where they are thanked by a messenger from God. 
* If the Hero&#x27;s alignment instead is &quot;chaos&quot;, he and the Heroine must go to the top floor and kill the archangel Michael, and on their way kill the Law Hero; in this scenario, Yuriko leaves the Hero and the Heroine instead of fighting them, while the Chaos Hero dies after trying to steal a magical ring from the Hero. On the roof, they meet Lucifer, who says that a new era will begin, where both demons and humans are free; he also warns them that God still is alive.
* If the Hero&#x27;s alignment instead is &quot;neutral&quot;, he and the Heroine must kill the Law Hero, the Chaos Hero, Asura-ou, and Michael, and fight Yuriko. On the roof, they meet Taishang Laojun, who thanks them and says that balance is needed to achieve happiness; he asks the Hero and the Heroine to lead humanity to a future that doesn&#x27;t rely on gods or demons.
The game ends with the Heroine saying that those who have died will be reborn, and that it is time for creation and rebuilding.

== Development ==

From the beginning of production, Atlus staff saw &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; as a chance to develop a game with the company&#x27;s brand on it. The main staff included director Yōsuke Niino, producer Hideyuki Yokoyama, programmer and future &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; director Kouji Okada, writers Ryutaro Ito and Kazunari Suzuki, and composer Tsukasa Masuko. Kazuma Kaneko worked on multiple aspects of the game, including character and sprite design, the world&#x27;s concept and visual design, and the creation of visual assets. Atlus saw the game as a remake of the previous game in the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series, &quot;Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II&quot;. As such, the staff knew what would happen with the story, so development went smoothly. An early factor in the game was the inclusion of a Law Hero and a Chaos Hero, and a protagonist who would initially be neutral and whose actions would affect their alignment. Kaneko defined this blending of different alignments as &quot;a sort of hodgepodge&quot; when compared to future games in the series. When designing it, the team slowly decided that they wanted to break the then-current gaming status quo using its aesthetic and content. That feeling, along with granting it a sense of reality through use of dark imagery, would later define the series. The main theme of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; was a person waking up to inevitable destruction and being able to do nothing but rely on their own abilities. The scenario took a long time to finalize, being revised a number of times by multiple staff members. During earlier drafts, it was planned that the finale of the story would take place in Israel after an extensive journey across Japan.

One of the reasons the development team chose Tokyo as the main setting was that its turbulent history, going through multiple phases of development and often suffering severe damage in wars or due to natural disasters, made it comparable with the fantasy settings of other games at the time. In a later interview, an Atlus staff member stated that this setting and style made it the antithesis of traditional fantasy RPGs, adding that this resulted in the game developing a punk spirit. Because of the post-apocalyptic setting of &quot;Megami Tensei II&quot;, the development team wanted to depict a time before the apocalypse. The decision to set the game in Tokyo was made by Suzuki and Kaneko, and was influenced by manga such as &quot;Violence Jack&quot;, &quot;Devilman&quot;, and &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;. Kichijōji was decided to be the game&#x27;s starting point due to Kaneko, Suzuki, and Ito all having lived in or near the area, or having visited it often. The abandoned Terminal Echo building there fascinated them, making them wonder how a building in such a prime location could remain unoccupied; Ito described it as two floors of arcade cabinets, with the rest of the building feeling like a ghost town. This fascination led to it being included as a dungeon in the game. While designing the maps, Kaneko wanted to use wire-frame models, but the Super Famicom&#x27;s limited capacities meant this idea was scrapped.

By the end of development, multiple members of staff voiced dissatisfaction with the final product. Ito and Suzuki felt that the portrayals of the Law and Chaos Heroes were imbalanced, with the Chaos Hero being too emotional and the Law Hero being unsympathetic. They also saw the demon fusion system as too difficult for players to master. Okada, while commenting on what improvements would be made for the next game, stated that there were too many useless items in the game. Niino felt that the game&#x27;s pacing and flow needed to be addressed, as after naming the characters, the player immediately is prompted to divide their status points.

===Character designs===
In addition to handling the graphics, Kaneko designed the character and demon designs for the game. The Hero&#x27;s and the Heroine&#x27;s clothes were designed to be futuristic; the Heroine was designed to be a protector, with clothes inspired by American football equipment. The Law Hero and Chaos Hero have ordinary clothes at first; the Chaos Hero was designed to look unsophisticated, with a bad posture and military clothes. After their metamorphoses, the Law Hero wears clothes designed to look priestly; Kaneko did not have a specific form in mind when designing them, but thought they looked &quot;Gucci-like&quot;. The Chaos Hero&#x27;s clothes after his metamorphosis were designed to be similar to the character Piccolo from the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga series; his hair style was also based on &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, specifically on that of the &quot;super saiyan&quot; transformations in that series. Kaneko wanted the Chaos Hero to change back and forth between human and demon form to tie in more closely with this design theme, but the concept was abandoned. During production, all the characters had names attached to them to help with identification during event planning. The character Louis Cyphre was inspired by the character of the same name from the 1987 movie &quot;Angel Heart&quot;. Some characters, such as Stephen and General Gotou, are based on real-life people; in the game files, they are identified as &quot;hoking&quot; and &quot;mishima&quot;, respectively. According to Ito, the character Thorman&#x27;s name was originally inspired by the Norse god of thunder, but after release, he realized that the name was highly similar to that of Harry S. Truman, the American president who approved the atomic attacks against Japan.

For the demon design, Kaneko took inspiration from Medieval woodblock prints, wooden carvings from South America, masks from Micronesia, and terracotta figurines from the Middle East. His designs of angelic characters were influenced by descriptions from the Book of Ezekiel of angels having multiple strange forms, such as multiple arms or heads. In addition to traditional demons and monsters, Kaneko designed versions of less-frequented figures from Celtic and Southeast Asian mythology. The theme he used when drawing them was &quot;fear&quot;, which extended to both obvious threats and the internal dread the creatures evoked. The graphics for most demons were directly drawn as sprites, without concept art, to make sure that the design and the graphics would work within the hardware limitations of the Super Famicom. Certain important characters, and some demons who the player would be guaranteed to meet, were drawn as concept art first. Several demons were designed in a way that allowed parts of their graphics to be reused; for instance, the demon Cerberus&#x27; body is also used for Shanhui and Nue, with a different color palette. Demon fusions were designed around the dichotomy of Law and Chaos, but in hindsight it was stated that this provided little fusion variety.

===Music===
The game&#x27;s music was composed by Tsukasa Masuko, with arrangements by Masuko and Tatsuya Nishiwaki. Masuko considered &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; to be an experimental work: it was the first time he had created music for the Super Famicom, so he was not familiar with the console&#x27;s specifications. During composition, he needed to check the specifications repeatedly to see what he could do within the hardware limitations. For the PC Engine port, the music was arranged by Hitoshi Sakimoto.

A soundtrack album, &quot;Shin Megami Tensei Law &amp; Chaos Disc&quot;, was released on February 24, 1993, by Victor Entertainment under the catalog number &quot;VICL-40046/7&quot;. It includes two discs: the first contains the music as it sounds in-game, and the second contains arrangements by Nishiwaki. A second album, &quot;Shin Megami Tensei Sound Collection&quot;, was released on March 5, 2003, by SME Visual Works under the catalog number &quot;SVWC-7175/6&quot;. It includes music from the original and PlayStation versions of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;, &quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&quot;, and &quot;Shin Megami Tensei If...&quot;, along with selected tracks from &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Nine&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; was first released on the Super Famicom on October 30, 1992, in Japan; it remained exclusive to that region for 22 years. It was the first &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; title not to be published by Namco. Instead, it was published by Atlus, which caused some complaints as to why Namco was not publishing the game. A fan translation of the Super Famicom version has been developed. Subsequent ports were released on the PC Engine (December 25, 1993), Mega-CD (February 25, 1994), the PlayStation (May 31, 2001), and Game Boy Advance (March 28, 2003). Atlus was responsible for the PlayStation port, and the staff were divided on whether to make it a complete port or something new. Those who wanted a direct port won through. The PC Engine port included added story scenes. SIMS Co., Ltd. was in charge of the Mega CD port, which included additional demons. The Game Boy Advance version, which was the first time &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; appeared on a portable platform, included the ability to exchange demons and items using the platform&#x27;s data exchange capacities. It also featured remastered music and alterations to ease the playing experience. The game was released in February 2012 for iOS and November of that year for Android. These mobile ports were based on the Game Boy Advance version, including all the port&#x27;s features. The iOS port was localized and released in North America and Europe on March 18, 2014. With the release of iOS 11 in 2017, the game is no longer compatible with up-to-date iOS devices.

===Localization===
&quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;, as with many other early &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; titles, was initially not localized for the West due to its controversial content such as the portrayal of religious elements. This content clashed with Nintendo&#x27;s strict content policy guidelines. The PlayStation port was also prevented from being localized by Sony&#x27;s then-current approval policy. The possibility of later localization after the series became established in the West were stalled due to the age of the game, which would have put it at a disadvantage in the modern gaming market.

In 2002, the team Aeon Genesis released an English translation patch unofficially for the original Super Famicom release of the game. They went on to release English translations for &quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Shin Megami Tensei if...&quot; in 2018. In 2021, another team released a translation patch for the GBA version that carries over the official iOS localization. In 2022, a third team released an unofficial English translation patch for the PlayStation release.

According to Nich Maragos, the editor of the English version of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;, it was already too late to localize the PlayStation and Game Boy Advance versions of the game by the time the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series had &quot;taken off&quot; in the US; Atlus normally does not have an interest in localizing mobile games, but saw the iOS version of the game as a perfect opportunity to fill in one of the gaps in the series. The localization project was slow at first, as it took time to extract the files from the game, so the localization team started by playing the game in order to find out what kinds of dialogue text and system messages it contained. After receiving the files, they translated the text, which was then sent to the editors; the edited text was sent back to the translators, who checked that nothing had been lost in translation, after which the text was inserted into the game. A challenge for the localization team was character limitations: only four rows of text, with 28 characters each, were able to be displayed at a time, and at some points this had to be limited even further in order to avoid graphical glitches. This was solved by modifying the game to allow for more text boxes as needed. Later &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; games, which had been localized before &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;, influenced the localization, as several of them include terms or quotes from the game. For instance, the catastrophe in &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; is referred to as the &quot;Great Cataclysm&quot; in &quot;Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army&quot;, while &quot;Persona 4&quot; and &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV&quot; include several quotes and terms from the game. The already translated &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; quotes from &quot;Persona 4&quot; localization were reused verbatim in the localization of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;.

==Reception==
According to Ito, the Super Famicom release was a great success for the company, helping establishing it as both a developer and publisher. While a success, the game also received criticism from players for its high encounter rate and difficulties using the map and in-game instructions. At the end of 2001, the PlayStation version was the 119th best selling video game of the year in Japan, with 85,991 sold copies.

On release, &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine gave the original Super Famicom version a score of 36 out of 40, with all four reviewers giving it a 9 out of 10. This made it one of their three highest-rated games of 1992, along with &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; and &quot;World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck&quot;. &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; was also one of only eleven games to have received a &quot;Famitsu&quot; score of 36/40 or above up until 1992. For subsequent console ports, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave scores of 25/40 (PCE), 28/40 (MD), 30/40 (PS), and 27/40 (GBA).

The website &quot;TouchArcade&quot; said that they loved the game, and that it was one of their favorite role-playing games on iOS. They did however think that the game was bad at explaining things, including the system of saving one&#x27;s progress. &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot;, too, thought that things were not explained enough. For instance, they said that the game does not guide players from point A to point B, and often does not even let players know where to start looking for point B. &quot;RPGFan&quot; echoed this, and said that it is not uncommon for players to wander around, wondering where to go. Gamezebo said they did not think the battle system was particularly exciting, but appreciated how the conversation system and the demon fusion adds elements of risk and reward to the game. Gamezebo found the iOS version&#x27;s touch screen-based virtual buttons clumsy to use, while &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; found the interface to work &quot;reasonably well&quot; while using the landscape mode, and &quot;RPGFan&quot; found the interface to be excellent. Both Gamezebo and &quot;TouchArcade&quot; wished the game had been a &quot;universal app&quot;, so that it could have been played on other devices than iPhone and iPod Touch without having the graphics upscaled.

Several reviewers appreciated the game&#x27;s plot. Gamezebo said that it was an aspect of the game that stood out in a positive way, and pointed out how good they thought the English translation was. &quot;TouchArcade&quot; called the story one of the game&#x27;s strengths, and said that it was impressive, despite how it had a tendency to be &quot;ham-fisted&quot;. &quot;RPGFan&quot; found the story to be good and macabre, and surprisingly relevant even in 2014. They disliked that there was very little character development, and how scenes that &quot;traditionally [would] be poignant&quot;, especially death scenes, were handled in a nonchalant manner.

&quot;TouchArcade&quot; called the graphics &quot;good, but not great&quot;, though reasonable given the game&#x27;s age, but that some demon designs were &quot;spectacular works of art&quot;. &quot;RPGFan&quot; found the majority of the game&#x27;s graphics to be &quot;functional, but not too appealing&quot;, and said that it was easy to get lost due to the bland textures of the walls and the floors. They did however like the graphics used in battles and story sections, which they found well-drawn and detailed. They praised the designs of the game&#x27;s female characters, especially Nekomata, Lamia, and Yuriko, but felt that the designs of the male characters were bland. &quot;TouchArcade&quot; found the music to be fantastic. &quot;RPGFan&quot; said that every piece fits into the scene where it is played, but that few were memorable. They did note &quot;Ginza&quot; as an exception, which they felt was so well-composed that it would sound good in any format.

==Legacy==
The success of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; led to multiple sequels over the coming years and made the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; franchise more popular. Development on a sequel began immediately after the success of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;. &quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&quot;, which directly continued the story of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;, was released in 1994. Multiple other &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; titles have followed and brought the series acclaim overseas. Kaneko&#x27;s concept of the Chaos Hero&#x27;s transformation was resurrected as the main gameplay mechanic of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga&quot;.

The game developer Toby Fox cited &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; as inspiration for his 2015 game &quot;Undertale&quot;, specifically its dialogue system.

<text>A stub network, or pocket network, is a somewhat casual term describing a computer network, or part of an internetwork, with no knowledge of other networks, that will typically send much or all of its non-local traffic out via a single path, with the network aware only of a default route to non-local destinations. As a practical analogy, think of an island which is connected to the rest of the world through a bridge and no other path is available either through air or sea. Continuing this analogy, the island might have more than one physical bridge to the mainland, but the set of bridges still represents only one logical path.

* An enterprise that connects to the corporate network by only one router, or multiple default routers connected to the same logical upstream destination.
* A single LAN which never carries packets between multiple routers connected to it. All traffic is to and/or from local hosts. The routers will only route packets into the LAN if it&#x27;s destined for the LAN, and out from the LAN if it originated on the LAN.
* A person, or workgroup, who is connected to an , by only one router, is a stub network with respect to the ISP. This stub network is part of the ISP&#x27;s , discussed below.
* For each interface on which no default route (also called the gateway of last resort) has been elected, refers to these subnets as stub networks.
* An OSPF stubby area is one which receives routes from other areas in the OSPF domain but for external routes, which are communicated via a Type 5 Link-state advertisement, the stubby area is only aware of a default route
* An OSPF totally stubby area is one which only has a default route to the rest of the OSPF routing domain. Such an area may have more than one router, but these routers will only know about the default route to the outside.
* A stub autonomous system that is connected to only one other autonomous system, through which it gains access to the Internet. This is also called a stub AS, which characterize the great majority of AS connected to the Internet. as of June 30, 2007, there were 224622 routes seen by the router. These came from 25577 autonomous systems, of which only 74 were transit-only and 22272 were stub/origin-only. 3305 autonomous systems provided some level of transit.
* Stub networks are not to be confused with transit networks, as transit networks contain at least two routers. These networks differ from stub networks since they are able to allow information to pass through them (hence the name). 
* The stub network is unique in the sense that it contains only one router, that router being the gateway to the network. Stub networks are also capable of implementing multi-homing technology. This technology is focused on setting a single computer to host multiple network connections and IP addresses.
* Stub networks are useful in situations where the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol needs to map out the topology of the network. Stub networks serve a special purpose in that they are a certain area within the construction of a network where IP addresses are filtered out and replaced with default routes.
* The experimental evaluation of stub networks has pushed for the use of ad hoc networks to act as stubs for larger multi-service networks. These networks are connected to a larger infrastructure in order to deliver a range of services including security, deliverance of unicast and multicast services, and many others to improve the functionality of these ad hoc networks.
