<text>The Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO; ; ), was a secret revolutionary society founded in the Ottoman territories in Europe, that operated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 

Founded in 1893 in Salonica, it initially aimed to gain autonomy for Macedonia and Adrianople regions in the Ottoman Empire, however, it later became an agent serving Bulgarian interests in Balkan politics. IMRO modeled itself after the earlier Bulgarian Internal Revolutionary Organization of Vasil Levski and accepted its motto &quot;Freedom or Death&quot; (Свобода или смърть). According to the memoirs of some founding and ordinary members, in the Organization&#x27;s earliest statute from 1894, the membership was reserved exclusively for Bulgarians. It used the Bulgarian language in all its documents and in its correspondence. The Organisation founded its Foreign Representation in Sofia, Bulgaria in 1896. Starting in the same year, it fought the Ottomans using guerrilla tactics, and in this, they were successful, even establishing a state within a state in some regions, including their tax collectors. This effort escalated in 1903 into the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising. The fighting involved about 15,000 IMRO irregulars and 40,000 Ottoman soldiers. After the uprising failed, and the Ottomans destroyed some 100 villages, the IMRO resorted to more systematic forms of terrorism targeting civilians. During the Balkan Wars and the First World War, the organization supported the Bulgarian army and joined Bulgarian war-time authorities when they temporarily took control over parts of Thrace and Macedonia. In this period, autonomism as a political tactic was abandoned, and annexationist positions were supported, aiming eventual incorporation of occupied areas into Bulgaria.

After the First World War the combined Macedonian-Thracian revolutionary movement separated into two detached organizations, IMRO and ITRO. After this moment the IMRO earned a reputation as an ultimate terror network, seeking to change state frontiers in the Macedonian regions of Greece and Serbia (later Yugoslavia). They contested the partitioning of Macedonia and launched raids from their Petrich stronghold into Greek and Yugoslav territory. Their base of operation in Bulgaria was jeopardized by the Treaty of Niš, and the IMRO reacted by assassinating Bulgarian prime minister Aleksandar Stamboliyski in 1923, with the cooperation of other Bulgarian elements opposed to him. In 1925 the Greek army launched a cross-border operation to reduce the IMRO base area, but it was ultimately stopped by the League of Nations, and IMRO attacks resumed. In the interwar period the IMRO also cooperated with the Croatian Ustaše, and their ultimate victim was Alexander I of Yugoslavia, assassinated in France in 1934. After the Bulgarian coup d&#x27;état of 1934, their Petrich stronghold was subjected to a military crackdown by the Bulgarian army, and the IMRO was reduced to a marginal phenomenon.

The organization changed its name on several occasions. After the fall of communism in the region, numerous parties claimed the IMRO name and lineage to legitimize themselves. Among them, in Bulgaria a right-wing party carrying the prefix &quot;VMRO&quot; was established in the 1990s, while in then Republic of Macedonia a right-wing party was established under the name &quot;VMRO-DPMNE&quot;.

== Ottoman era ==

=== Origins and goals ===

The organization was founded in 1893 in Ottoman Thessaloniki by a small band of anti-Ottoman Macedono-Bulgarian revolutionaries, who considered Macedonia an indivisible territory and all of its inhabitants &quot;Macedonians&quot;, no matter their religion or ethnicity. In practice, IMRO was established by Bulgarians and most of their followers were Bulgarians. The organization was a secret revolutionary society operating in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the goal of autonomous Macedonia and Adrianople regions. At that time IMRO was often called &quot;the Bulgarian Committee&quot;, while its members were designated as &quot;Comitadjis&quot;, i.e. &quot;committee men&quot;. Initially, they were against the aspirations of neighboring states in the area and saw the future autonomous Macedonia and Southern Thrace as a multi-ethnic entity. It appears likely that at the early stages of the struggle, a desired outcome of the autonomy was unification with Bulgaria. This aim was changed later with the idea of transforming the Balkans into a federal state, in which Macedonia and Thrace would enter as equal members. The idea of autonomy was strictly political and did not imply a secession from Bulgarian ethnicity. Even those, who advocated for independent Macedonia and Thrace, never doubted the predominantly Bulgarian character of the Slavic population in both areas. The organization was founded by Hristo Tatarchev, Dame Gruev, Petar Pop-Arsov, Andon Dimitrov, Hristo Batandzhiev and Ivan Hadzhinikolov. All of them were closely connected with the Bulgarian Men&#x27;s High School of Thessaloniki. 

According to Hristo Tatarchev&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;, IMRO was first called simply the Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (MRO), and the word &quot;Bulgarian&quot; was later dropped from it. However neither statutes nor regulations, or other basic documents with such names have not yet been found. Thus, according to the Macedonian historian Ivan Katardžiev, the organization never bore as an official name the designation &quot;Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation&quot;.. It is believed by many historians that in 1894 or 1896 this probably unofficial name was changed to Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees (BMARC); and the organisation existed under this name until 1897 or 1902, when it was changed to Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (SMARO). Some Macedonian historians also acknowledge the existence of the name &quot;ВMARC&quot; in the very early period of the Organisation (1894–1896), while others dispute it. Thus, in North Macedonia it is generally assumed that in the period 1896–1902, the name of the organization was &quot;SMARO&quot;. It is not disputed that the organization changed its name to Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) in 1905 and it is under this name referred to in Bulgarian historiography. After disbanding itself during the first Bulgarian annexation of Macedonia (1915–1918), the organization was revived in 1919 under the name Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), under which it is generally known today.
Ivan Hadzhinikolov in his memoirs lists the five basic principles of the MRO&#x27;s foundation:


According to Dr. Hristo Tatarchev:

In Dame Gruev&#x27;s memoirs, the MRO&#x27;s goals are stated as follows:


The &quot;Adrianople Region&quot; was the general name given by the Organization to those areas of Thrace which, like Macedonia, had been left under Turkish rule i.e. most of it, where the Bulgarian element predominated in the mixed population, too. The organized revolutionary movement in Thrace dates from 1895, when Dame Gruev recruited Hristo Kotsev, born in Shtip, who was then a teacher in the Bulgarian Men&#x27;s High School of Adrianople. Acting in the name of the Central Committee, Kotsev set up a regional committee in Adrianople, and gradually committees were established in a large area.

The stated goal of the original Committee was to unite all elements dissatisfied with the Ottoman oppression in Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet, eventually obtaining political autonomy for the two regions. In this task, the organisation hoped to enlist the support of the local Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, Greeks and even Turks. Efforts were concentrated on moral propaganda and the prospect of rebellion and terrorist actions seemed distant. The organization developed quickly: only in a matter of a few years, the Committee had managed to establish a wide network of local organisations across Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet. These usually centered around the schools of the Bulgarian Exarchate and had as leaders local or Bulgarian-born teachers.

Although IMRO was predominantly ethnic Bulgarian since its establishment, it favoured the idea of an autonomous Macedonia and preferred to disassociate itself from official Bulgarian policy and was not under government control. Its founding leaders believed that an autonomous movement was more likely to find favour with the Great Powers than one which was a tool of the Bulgarian government. In the words of British contemporary observer Henry Brailsford:

What is more, some of its younger leaders espoused radical socialist and anarchist ideas and saw their goal as the establishment of a new form of government rather than unification with Bulgaria. Eventually, these considerations led the organisation to change its statute and accept as members not only Bulgarians but all Macedonians and Odrinians regardless of ethnicity or creed. In reality, however, besides some Aromanian members, its membership remained overwhelmingly Bulgarian Exarchist.

In regard to the socialist and cosmopolitan ideas within the revolutionary movement, the American Albert Sonnichsen says:

It is claimed by contemporary historians that the right wing supporters within the IMRO were probably much more likely to see unification with Bulgaria as a natural final outcome of Macedonian autonomy. Among other documents, they cite as an expression of this understanding the official letter that Dame Gruev and Boris Sarafov, leaders of the headquarters of the Second Macedonian-Adrianople revolutionary district during the Ilinden uprising, wrote to the Bulgarian government:

In his Macedonistic publication &quot;On Macedonian Matters&quot; written in the wake of the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie uprising, Krste Misirkov, a highly controversial writer who alternated between pan-Bulgarian and pan-Macedonian nationalism throughout his lifetime, described the IMARO as an organization of Bulgarian officials who work for Bulgarian interests and who are linked in name, and in church and school matters, to the people of Bulgaria, their country and their interests. However, he adds that the revolutionaries were playing a two sided game working under a &quot;Bulgarian mask&quot; in order to gain support and make use of the Bulgarian people, their official representatives and institutions to serve their own separatist interests. Misirkov wrote:

Dimitar Vlahov, another extremely controversial politician and revolutionary, who also alternated between pan-Bulgarian and pan-Macedonian nationalism, member of the left wing of the Macedonian-Adrianople revolutionary movement, later Bulgarian deputy in Ottoman Parliament, afterwards one of the main leaders of IMRO (United) – de facto extension of the Bulgarian Communist Party, finally elected in 1946 as ethnic Macedonian vice-president of the Praesidium of Communist Yugoslavia&#x27;s Parliament, expressed in his book &quot;The struggles of Macedonian people for freedom&quot;, published in Vienna in 1925, his view, confirmed again in Vlahov&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;, published in Skopje in 1970:

=== Armed struggle against the Ottomans ===
The initial period of idealism for SMARO ended, however, with the Vinitsa Affair and the discovery by the Ottoman police of a secret depot of ammunition near the Bulgarian border in 1897. The wide-scale repressions against the activists of the organization led to its transformation into a militant guerilla organization, which engaged into attacks against Ottoman officials and punitive actions against suspected traitors. The guerilla groups of SMARO, known as &quot;chetas&quot; (чети) later (after 1903) also waged a war against the pro-Serbian and pro-Greek armed groups during the Greek Struggle for Macedonia.
SMARO&#x27;s leadership of the revolutionary movement was challenged by two other factions: the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee (SMAC) in Sofia (&quot;Vurhoven makedono-оdrinski komitet&quot; – Върховен македоно-одрински комитет) and a smaller group of conservatives in Salonica – Bulgarian Secret Revolutionary Brotherhood (&quot;Balgarsko Tayno Revolyutsionno Bratstvo&quot;). The latter was incorporated in SMARO by 1899, its members as Ivan Garvanov, were to exert a significant influence on the organization. They were to push for the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising and later became the core of IMRO right-wing faction.

SMAC became known earlier than IMRO, after the 1895 raids into Turkish territory it organised from Bulgaria. Its founders were Macedonian immigrants in Bulgaria as well as Bulgarian army officers. They became known as the &quot;supremists&quot; or &quot;externals&quot; since they were based outside of Macedonia. The supremists resorted to terrorism against the Ottomans in the hope of provoking a war and thus Bulgarian annexation of Macedonia. For a time between 1899-1901 SMARO leaders managed to gain control of the SMAC but it soon split into two factions: one loyal to the SMARO and one led by some officers close to the Bulgarian prince. The second one staged an ill-fated uprising in Eastern Macedonia in 1902, where they were opposed militarily by local SMARO bands led by Yane Sandanski and Hristo Chernopeev, who were later to become the leaders of the IMARO left-wing. 

In April 1903, a group of young anarchists connected with SMARO, called &quot;Gemidžiite&quot; – graduates from the Bulgarian secondary school in Thessaloniki – launched a campaign of terror bombing in Thessaloniki with the aim to attract the attention of the Great Powers to Ottoman oppression in Macedonia and Eastern Thrace.

In May 1903 the undisputed leader of the organization, Gotse Delchev, was killed in a skirmish with Turkish forces. Although Delchev had opposed the ideas for an uprising as premature, he finally had no choice but agree to that course of action but at least managed to delay its start from May to August. In August 1903 SMARO organised the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising against the Ottomans in Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet, which after the initial successes including the forming of the Krushevo Republic, was crushed with much loss of life.

=== After Ilinden ===

The failure of the 1903 insurrection resulted in the eventual split of the IMARO into a left-wing (federalist) faction in the Serres, Strumica and Salonica districts, and a right-wing faction (centralists) in the Bitola and Skopje districts. Among the leaders of the left-wing were Yane Sandanski, Hristo Chernopeev, Dimo Hadzhidimov and Petar Pop Arsov, while in the right-wing were Ivan Garvanov, Boris Sarafov and Hristo Matov. The left-wing faction opposed Bulgarian nationalism and advocated the creation of a Balkan Socialist Federation with equality for all subjects and nationalities. The Supreme Macedonian Committee was disbanded in 1905 but the centralist faction of the IMARO drifted more and more towards Bulgarian nationalism as its regions became increasingly exposed to the incursions of Serb and Greek armed bands, which started infiltrating Macedonia after 1903. The years 1904–1908 saw much fighting between IMARO and Turkish forces as well as between IMARO and Greek and Serb detachments. Meanwhile, the split between the two factions became culminated when in 1907 Todor Panitsa killed the right-wing leaders Boris Sarafov and Ivan Garvanov. The armed Albanian bands of Çerçiz Topulli cooperated and were on good terms with armed groups of Bulgarian-Macedonian revolutionaries operating in the Lake Prespa region and Kastoria area, a bond formed due to their hostility toward Greeks.
After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908 both factions laid down their arms and joined the legal struggle. Yane Sandanski and Hristo Chernopeev contacted the Young Turks and started legal operation. They tried to set up the &quot;Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization&quot; (MARO). Initially, the group developed only propaganda activities. Later, the congress for MARO&#x27;s official inauguration failed and federalist wing joined mainstream political life as the Peoples&#x27; Federative Party (Bulgarian Section) (PFP). Some of its leaders like Sandanski and Chernopeev participated in the march on Istanbul to depose the counter-revolutionaries. The former centralists formed the Union of the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs and like the PFP participated in Ottoman elections. Soon, however, the Young Turk regime turned increasingly nationalist and sought to suppress the national aspirations of the various minorities in Macedonia and Thrace. This prompted most right-wing and some left-wing IMARO leaders such as Chernopeev to resume the armed fight in 1909. In January 1910 Hristo Chernopeev and some of his followers founded a Bulgarian People&#x27;s Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization which merged with IMARO in 1911 and a new Central Committee of IMARO was formed consisting of Todor Alexandrov, Hristo Chernopeev and Petar Chaulev. Its aim was to restore unity to the Organisation and direct the new armed struggle against the Turks more efficiently. After Chernopeev was killed in action in 1915 as a Bulgarian officer in World War I, he was replaced by the former supremist leader General Alexander Protogerov.
=== Balkan Wars and World War I===
During the Balkan Wars former IMARO leaders of both the left and the right joined the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps and fought with the Bulgarian Army. Others like Sandanski with their bands assisted the Bulgarian army with its advance and still others penetrated as far as the region of Kastoria southwestern Macedonia. In the Second Balkan War IMORO bands fought the Greeks and Serbs behind the front lines but were subsequently routed and driven out. Notably, Petar Chaulev was one of the leaders of the Ohrid-Debar Uprising organised jointly by IMORO and the Albanians of Western Macedonia.


The Tikvesh Uprising was another uprising in late June 1913, organized by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization against the Serbian occupation of Vardar Macedonia and took place behind the Serbian lines during the Second Balkan War.

The result of the Balkan Wars was that the Macedonian region and Adrianople Thrace was partitioned between Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and the Ottoman Empire (the new state of Yugoslavia was created as after 1918 and started its existence as Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenians &quot;SHS&quot;), with Bulgaria getting the smallest share. In 1913 the whole Thracian Bulgarian population from the Ottoman part of Eastern Thrace was forcibly expelled to Bulgaria. IMARO, now led by Todor Aleksandrov, maintained its existence in Bulgaria, where it played a role in politics by playing upon Bulgarian irredentism and urging a renewed war to liberate Macedonia. This was one factor in Bulgaria allying itself with Germany and Austria-Hungary in World War I. During the First World War in Macedonia (1915–1918) the organization supported Bulgarian army and joined to Bulgarian war-time authorities when they took control over Vardar Macedonia temporarily until the end of war. In this period the autonomism as political tactics was abandoned from all internal IMARO streams and all of them shared annexationist positions, supporting eventual incorporation of Macedonia in Bulgaria. IMARO organised the Valandovo action of 1915, which was an attack on a large Serbian force. Bulgarian army, supported by the organization&#x27;s forces, was successful in the first stages of this conflict, managed to drive out the Serbian forces from Vardar Macedonia and came into positions on the line of the pre-war Greek-Serbian border, which was stabilized as a firm front until end of 1918.

After 1917 the Bulgarian government started using paramilitary groups to gain control over the internal situation in both Pomoravlje and Macedonia. Aleksandar Protogerov who headed the Bulgarian occupation troops in Morava region crushed the uprising in the Toplica district with the help of IMRO irregulars. Bulgarians paramilitary groups were responsible for multiple instances of war crimes committing during the war in the parts of the Kingdom of Serbia under Bulgarian occupation.

On the eve of outbreak of World War I, IMRO paramilitary activity in Serbia aimed to provoke a war with Bulgaria. At that time Serbia implemented in Macedonia a program of forced Serbianization. In an incident during 1914, when Bulgaria was still neutral, ca. 2,000 strong IMRO-cheta attacked a railway bridge over the Vardar River, massacring 477 men. In another incident in the same year, the first Macedonian recruits mobilized into the Serbian army demonstratively refused to take the military oath in Kragujevac, and were subjected to repression. As result IMRO set up a secret committee in Veles, which aim was to coordinate the transfer to Bulgaria of thousands of Macedonian deserters by the Serbian army. Later its comitadjis were incorporated into the regular Bulgarian Army and its power grew in significance. The fact that these paramilitary companies joined the Bulgarian Army marked a significant change in the way they were conducting war. At the beginning it formed the 11th Macedonian Infantry Division, and later other units, as for example &quot;guerilla companies&quot;. Its entrance into the war towards the end of 1915 contributed to the defeat and occupation of Serbia, and the unification of Macedonia with Bulgaria. In Serbia the IMRO activity was identical with the Bulgarian policy, supporting the Bulgarization of the area. At the end of 1915 and the beginning of 1916 several massacres of (sic) &quot;Serbomans&quot; were conducted in Vardar Macedonia in the areas of Azot, Skopska Crna Gora and Poreče by IMRO-irregulars, aided by the guerrilla companies of the 11th Macedonian Infantry Division. The police chief of the Military Inspection Area of Macedonia reported to the interior minister that he cannot deal with the lawlessness of the paramilitaries. In fact 1917 was the turning point when IMRO became the instrument used by the Bulgarian government to gain control over the internal situation in the Pomoravlje and most from the region of Macedonia. At that time the IMRO leaders as general Aleksandar Protogerov headed the Bulgarian occupation troops in Morava region and crushed the uprising in the Toplica district with the help by IMRO irregulars. Their methods caused death of thousand people, destruction of their property, looting and other war crimes committed during the war in the parts of the Kingdom of Serbia under Bulgarian control.

== Interwar period ==

The post-war Treaty of Neuilly again denied Bulgaria what it felt was its share of Macedonia and Thrace. After this moment the combined Macedonian-Adrianopolitan revolutionary movement separated into two detached organizations: Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation (&quot;bulg.&quot; Вътрешна тракийска революционна организация) and Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation. ITRO was a revolutionary organisation active in the Greek regions of Thrace and Macedonia to the river Strymon and Rhodope Mountains between 1922 and 1934. The reason for the establishment of ITRO was the transfer of the region from Bulgaria to Greece in May 1920. ITRO proclaimed its goal as the &quot;unification of all the disgruntled elements in Thrace regardless of their nationality&quot;, and to win full political independence for the region. Later IMRO created as a satellite organisation the Internal Western Outland Revolutionary Organisation (&quot;bulg.&quot; Вътрешна западнопокрайненска революционна организация), which operated in the areas of Tsaribrod and Bosilegrad, ceded to Yugoslavia. IMRO concentrated in Pirin Macedonia began sending armed bands called &quot;cheti&quot; into Aegean Macedonia and Vardar Macedonia and Thrace to assassinate officials and stir up the spirit of the oppressed population. The Bulgarian Prime Minister Aleksandar Stamboliyski favoured a détente with Greece and Yugoslavia, so that Bulgaria could concentrate on its internal problems, and preferred the creation of a Balkan Federation. In 1921 from the former left-wing of IMARO the Macedonian Federative Organization was formed, they were supported by Stamboliyski and had a hostile rivalry with Todor Aleksandrov&#x27;s IMRO. On 23 March 1923 Stamboliyski signed the Treaty of Niš with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and undertook the obligation to suppress the operations of the IMRO carried out from Bulgarian territory. However, in the same year IMRO agents assassinated him. IMRO had &quot;de facto&quot; full control of Pirin Macedonia (the Petrich District of the time) and acted as a &quot;state within a state&quot;, which it used as a base for hit and run attacks against Yugoslavia with the unofficial support of the right-wing Bulgarian government and later Fascist Italy. Because of this, contemporary observers described the Yugoslav-Bulgarian frontier as the most fortified in Europe. 

In 1923 and 1924 during the apogee of interwar military activity according to IMRO statistics in the region of Yugoslav (Vardar) Macedonia operated 53 &quot;chetas&quot; (armed bands), 36 of which penetrated from Bulgaria, 12 were local and 5 entered from Albania. The aggregate membership of the bands was 3245 &quot;komitas&quot; (guerilla rebels) led by 79 &quot;voivodas&quot; (commanders), 54 subcommanders, 41 secretaries and 193 couriers. 119 fights and 73 terroristic acts were documented. Serbian casualties were 304 army and gendarmery officers, soldiers and paramilitary fighters, more than 1300 were wounded. IMRO lost 68 &quot;voivodas&quot; and &quot;komitas&quot;, hundreds were wounded. In the region of Greek (Aegean) Macedonia 24 chetas and 10 local reconnaissance detachments were active. The aggregate membership of the bands was 380 &quot;komitas&quot; led by 18 &quot;voivodas&quot;, 22 subcommanders, 11 secretaries and 25 couriers. 42 battles and 27 terrorist acts were performed. Greek casualties were 83 army officers, soldiers and paramilitary fighters, over 230 were wounded. IMRO lost 22 &quot;voivodas&quot; and &quot;komitas&quot;, 48 were wounded. Thousands of locals were repressed by the Yugoslav and Greek authorities on suspicions of contacts with the revolutionary movement. The population in Pirin Macedonia was organized in a mass people&#x27;s home guard. This militia was the only force, which resisted the Greek army when the Greek dictator, General Pangalos launched a military campaign against Petrich District in 1925. In 1934 the Bulgarian army confiscated 10,938 rifles, 637 pistols, 47 machine-guns, 7 mortars and 701,388 cartridges only in the Petrich and Kyustendil Districts. At the same time, a youth&#x27;s extension of IMRO, the Macedonian Youth Secret Revolutionary Organization was created. The statute of MYSRO was approved personally from IMRO&#x27;s leader Todor Alexandrov. The aim of MYSRO was in concordance with the statute of IMRO – unification of all of Macedonia in an authonomous unit, within a future Balkan Federative Republic.
The Sixth Congress of the Balkan Communist Federation under the leadership of the Bulgarian communist Vasil Kolarov and the Fifth Congress of the Comintern, an adjunct of the Soviet foreign policy, held concurrently in Moscow in 1923, voted for the formation of an &quot;&quot;Autonomous and Independent Macedonia and Thrace&quot;.&quot; In 1924 IMRO entered negotiations with the Macedonian Federative Organization and the Comintern about collaboration between the communists and the Macedonian movement and the creation of a united Macedonian movement. The idea for a new unified organization was supported by the Soviet Union, which saw a chance for using this well-developed revolutionary movement to spread revolution in the Balkans and destabilize the Balkan monarchies. Alexandrov defended IMRO&#x27;s independence and refused to concede on practically all points requested by the Communists. No agreement was reached except for a paper &quot;Manifesto&quot; (the so-called May Manifesto of 6 May 1924), in which the objectives of the unified Macedonian liberation movement were presented: independence and unification of partitioned Macedonia, fighting all the neighbouring Balkan monarchies, forming a Balkan Communist Federation and cooperation with the Soviet Union. Failing to secure Alexandrov&#x27;s cooperation, the Comintern decided to discredit him and published the contents of the Manifesto on 28 July 1924 in the &quot;Balkan Federation&quot; newspaper. VMRO&#x27;s leaders Todor Aleksandrov and Aleksandar Protogerov promptly denied through the Bulgarian press that they&#x27;ve ever signed any agreements, claiming that the May Manifesto was a communist forgery.
 Shortly after the publication, Todor Alexandrov was assassinated on 31 August, and IMRO came under the leadership of Ivan Mihailov, who became a powerful figure in Bulgarian politics. While IMRO&#x27;s leadership was quick to ascribe Alexandrov&#x27;s murder to the communists and even quicker to organise a revenge action against the immediate perpetrators, there is some doubt that Mihailov himself might have been responsible for the murder. Some Bulgarian and Macedonian historians like Zoran Todorovski speculate that it might have been the circle around Mihailov who organised the assassination on inspiration by the Bulgarian government, which was afraid of united IMRO-Communist action against it. However, neither version is corroborated by conclusive historical evidence. The result of the murder was further strife within the organisation and several high-profile murders, including that of Petar Chaulev (who led the Ohrid-Debar Uprising against the Serbian occupation) in Milan and ultimately Protogetov himself.
In this interwar period IMRO led by Aleksandrov and later by Mihailov took actions against the former left-wing assassinating several former members of IMARO&#x27;s Sandanist wing, who meanwhile had gravitated towards the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Macedonian Federative Organization. Gjorche Petrov was killed in Sofia in 1921, Todor Panitsa (who previously killed the right-wing oriented Boris Sarafov and Ivan Garvanov) was assassinated in Vienna in 1925 by Mihailov&#x27;s future wife Mencha Karnichiu. Dimo Hadzhidimov, Arseni Yovkov, Vladislav Kovachev, Aleksandar Bujnov, Chudomir Kantardzhiev, Stojo Hadzhiev, Georgi Skrizhovski and many others were killed in the aftermath of the May Manifesto. Meanwhile, the left-wing later did form a new organisation based on the principles previously presented in the May Manifesto. The new organization which was an opponent to Mihailov&#x27;s IMRO was called IMRO (United) was founded in 1925 in Vienna. However, it did not have real popular support and remained based abroad with no revolutionary activities in Macedonia. Mihailov&#x27;s group of young IMRO cadres soon got into conflict with the older guard of the organization. The latter were in favour of the old tactic of incursions by armed bands, whereas the former favoured more flexible tactics with smaller terrorist groups carrying selective assassinations. The conflict grew into a leadership struggle and Mihailov soon, in turn, ordered the assassination in 1928 of a rival leader, General Aleksandar Protogerov, which sparked a fratricidal war between &quot;Mihailovists&quot; and &quot;Protogerovists&quot;. The less numerous Protogerovists soon became allied with Yugoslavia and certain Bulgarian military circles with fascist leanings and who favoured rapprochement with Yugoslavia. The policy of assassinations was effective in making Serbian rule in Vardar Macedonia feel insecure but in turn provoked brutal reprisals on the local peasant population. Having lost a lot of popular support in Vardar Macedonia due to his policies, Mihailov favoured the &quot;internationalization&quot; of the Macedonian question.

He established close links with the Croatian Ustashi and Italy. Numerous assassinations were carried out by IMRO agents in many countries, the majority in Yugoslavia. The most spectacular of these was the assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia and the French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou in Marseille in 1934 in collaboration with the Croatian Ustashi. The killing was carried out by the VMRO assassin Vlado Chernozemski and happened after the suppression of IMRO following the 19 May 1934 military coup in Bulgaria. IMRO&#x27;s constant fratricidal killings and assassinations abroad provoked some within Bulgarian military after the coup of 19 May 1934 to take control and break the power of the organization, which had come to be seen as a gangster organization inside Bulgaria and a band of assassins outside it. In 1934 Mihailov was forced to escape to Turkey. He ordered to his supporters not to resist to the Bulgarian army and to accept the disarmament peacefully, thus avoiding fratricides, destabilization of Bulgaria, civil war or external invasion. Many inhabitants of Pirin Macedonia met this disbandment with satisfaction because it was perceived as relief from an unlawful and quite often brutal parallel authority. IMRO kept its organization alive in exile in various countries but ceased to be an active force in Macedonian politics except for brief moments during World War II. Meanwhile, in January 1934 a resolution of the Comintern for recognition of a distinct ethnic Macedonian ethnicity was prepared in cooperation with IMRO (United), and published in April 1934. IMRO (United) remained active until 1936 when it was absorbed into the Balkan Communist Federation.

IMRO used at that time, what the American journalist H. R. Knickerbocker described as: &quot;&quot;the only system I ever heard of to guarantee that their members carry out assigned assassinations, no matter what the police terror might be&quot;.&quot;

== Second World War period ==

As the Bulgarian army entered Yugoslav Vardar Macedonia in 1941, it was greeted by most of the population as liberators and former IMRO members were active in organising Bulgarian Action Committees, charged with taking over the local authorities. Some former IMRO (United) members, such as Metodi Shatorov, who was the regional leader of the Yugoslav Communist Party, also refused to define the Bulgarian forces as occupiers, contrary to instructions from Belgrade and called for the incorporation of the local Macedonian Communist organisations within the Bulgarian Communist Party. This policy changed towards 1943 with the arrival of the Montenegrin Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo, who began in earnest to organise armed resistance to the Bulgarian occupation. Many former IMRO members assisted the authorities in fighting Macedonian Partisans.

In Greece the Bulgarian troops, following on the heels of the German invasion of the country, occupied the whole of Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace. In eastern and central Macedonia, some of the local Slavic-speaking minority greeted the Bulgarian troops as liberators, and efforts were undertaken by the Bulgarian authorities to &quot;instill in them a Bulgarian national identity&quot;. Bulgaria officially annexed the occupied territories in Yugoslavia and Greece, which had long been a target of Bulgarian irredentism. The IMRO was also active in organising Bulgarian militias in Italian and German occupation zones against Greek nationalist and communist groups as EAM-ELAS and EDES. With the help of Mihailov and Macedonian emigres in Sofia, several pro-Bulgarian armed detachments &quot;Ohrana&quot; were organised in the Kastoria, Florina and Edessa districts. These were led by Bulgarian officers originally from Greek Macedonia – Andon Kalchev and Georgi Dimchev. It was apparent that Mihailov had broader plans which envisaged the creation of a Macedonian state under a German control. It was also anticipated that the IMRO volunteers would form the core of the armed forces of a future Independent Macedonia in addition to providing administration and education in the Florina, Kastoria and Edessa districts.

On 2 August 1944 (in what in the North Macedonia is referred to as the Second Ilinden) in the St. Prohor Pčinjski monastery at the Antifascist assembly of the national liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM) with the vice-president of the Presidium Panko Brashnarov (the former IMRO revolutionary from the Ilinden period and the IMRO United) as a first speaker, the SR Macedonia was officially proclaimed, as a federal state within SFR Yugoslavia, receiving recognition from the Allies. Another former IMRO member Dimitar Vlahov was elected as a representative in the Presidium of AVNOJ. After the declaration of war by Bulgaria on Germany, in September 1944 Mihailov arrived in German-occupied Skopje, where the Germans hoped that he could form a pro-German Independent State of Macedonia with their support. Seeing that the war is lost to Germany and to avoid further bloodshed, he refused. Mihailov eventually ended up in Rome where he published numerous articles, books and pamphlets on the Macedonian Question.

== Post-war period ==
Members of the IMRO (United) participated in the forming of SR Macedonia a federal state of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and some of the leading members entered the government: Dimitar Vlahov, Panko Brashnarov, Pavel Shatev (the latter was the last surviving member of &quot;Gemidzhii&quot;, the group that executed the Thessaloniki bombings of 1903). However, they were quickly ousted by cadres loyal to the Yugoslav Communist Party in Belgrade, who had had pro-Serbian leanings before the war. According to Macedonian historian Ivan Katardjiev such Macedonian activists came from IMRO (United) and the Bulgarian Communist Party never managed to get rid of their pro-Bulgarian bias and on many issues opposed the Serbian-educated leaders, who held most of the political power. Pavel Shatev went as far as to send a petition to the Bulgarian legation in Belgrade protesting the anti-Bulgarian policies of the Yugoslav leadership and the Serbianisation of the Bulgarian language.
From the start, the Yugoslav authorities organised frequent purges and trials of Macedonian communists and non-party people charged with autonomist deviation. Many of the left-wing IMRO government officials, including Pavel Shatev and Panko Brashnarov, were purged from their positions, too, then isolated, arrested, imprisoned or executed by the Yugoslav federal authorities on various (in many cases fabricated) charges including: pro-Bulgarian leanings, demands for greater or complete independence of Yugoslav Macedonia, collaboration with the Cominform after the Tito–Stalin split in 1948, forming of conspirative political groups or organisations, demands for greater democracy, etc. One of the victims of these campaigns was Metodija Andonov Cento, a wartime partisan leader and president of ASNOM, who was convicted of having worked for a &quot;completely independent Macedonia&quot; as an IMRO member. A survivor among the communists associated with the idea of Macedonian autonomy was Dimitar Vlahov, who was used &quot;solely for window dressing&quot;.

On the other hand, former Mihailovists were also persecuted by the Belgrade-controlled authorities on accusations of collaboration with the Bulgarian occupation, Bulgarian nationalism, anti-communist and anti-Yugoslav activities, etc. Notable victims included Spiro Kitinchev, mayor of Skopje, Ilija Kocarev, mayor of Ohrid and Georgi Karev, the mayor of Krushevo during the Bulgarian occupation and brother of Ilinden revolutionary Nikola Karev. Another IMRO activist, Sterio Guli, son of Pitu Guli, reportedly shot himself upon the arrival of Tito&#x27;s partisans in Krushevo in despair over what he saw as a second period of Serbian dominance in Macedonia. Also, Shatorov&#x27;s supporters in Vardar Macedonia, called Sharlisti, were systematically exterminated by the YCP in the autumn of 1944, and repressed for their anti-Yugoslav and pro-Bulgarian political positions.

IMRO&#x27;s supporters in Bulgarian Pirin Macedonia fared no better. With the help of some former Protogerovists, their main activists were hunted by the Communist police and many of them killed or imprisoned. Because some IMRO supporters openly opposed the then official policy of Communist Bulgaria to promote Macedonian ethnic consciousness in Pirin Macedonia they were repressed or exiled to the interior of Bulgaria. Many from this persecuted people emigrated through Greece and Turkey to Western countries. At this period the American and Greek intelligence services recruited some of them, trained them and later used this so-called &quot;Goryani&quot; as spies and saboteurs, smuggling them back to Communist Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.

Despite the fact that Yugoslav Macedonian historical scholarship reluctantly acknowledged the Bulgarian ethnic self-identification of the Ilinden IMRO leaders, they were adopted in the national pantheon of Yugoslav Macedonia as ethnic Macedonians. Official Yugoslav historiography asserted a continuity between the Ilinden of 1903 and the Ilinden of ASNOM in 1944 ignoring the fact that the first one included the uprising in the Adrianople part of Thrace region as well. The names of the IMRO revolutionaries were Goce Delchev, Pitu Guli, Dame Gruev and Yane Sandanski were included in the lyrics of the anthem of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia Denes nad Makedonija (&quot;Today over Macedonia&quot;).

== Interpretations during the communist period ==
Initially Lazar Koliševski, the leader of the new Yugoslav Republic—SR Macedonia, proclaimed that the Ilinden Uprising and the IMRO were Bulgarian conspiracies. Afterwards the historical studies in the country were expanded under direct political instructions from Belgrade. It was advanced as a key principle of the Macedonian historiography, that its primary goal was to create a separate national consciousness, and to sever any historical ties to Bulgaria. During the Cold War, particularly after the Tito–Stalin split, the heroes of 19th century left-wing IMRO, especially Delchev and Sandanski, were claimed by both Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, both internally and in a tactical game of international diplomacy. One thing that two countries had in common though was that the vague populism and anarchism of these historical figures was interpreted as a definite socialist program. Both regimes recognized the policies of the interwar leaders of the organization Todor Aleksandrov and Ivan Mihailov as &quot;fascist&quot;.

In this race, the Socialist Republic of Macedonia was the first to incorporate the IMRO figures in its national pantheon, although some careful exceptions were made. The 1903 Ilinden Uprising was presented as a direct precursor of the 1944 events, which were termed a &quot;Second Ilinden&quot;, in an effort to prove the continuity of the struggle for independence of the Macedonian nation. Consequently, it became necessary for the socialist authorities to show that 19th century IMRO figures, particularly Delchev and Sandanski, had been consciously Macedonian in identity. Delchev and Sandanski were adopted as symbols of the republic, had numerous monuments built in their honor, and they were often the topic of articles in the academic journal &quot;Macedonian Review&quot;, as was the Ilinden Uprising. In contrast, Todor Aleksandrov was labeled a Bulgarian bourgeois chauvinist. The claim to a Macedonian identity of Sandanski was used to bolster Skopje&#x27;s claim to the Pirin region. According to historians John Lampe and Mark Mazower, IMRO heroes have been important in the creation of a Macedonian national ideology, in both Bulgaria and North Macedonia the historiographies thrive on proving that their version of history is wrong in turn making historical objectivity not important.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria the situation was more complex, because the IMRO was associated with the 1923–34 anti-communist regime. Before 1960, although the subject was not taboo, few articles on the topic appeared in Bulgarian academic venues, and the IMRO figures were given mostly regional recognition in the Pirin region. After 1960, orders from the highest level were to reincorporate the Macedonian revolutionary movement in the Bulgarian history, and to prove the Bulgarian credentials of their historical leaders. This trend reached its peak in 1981 (the 1300 year anniversary of Bulgarian state), when Delchev and Sandanski were openly made historical symbols of the Bulgarian state in a proclamation of Lyudmila Zhivkova. There were also attempts to rehabilitate Todor Aleksandrov because of his Bulgarian nationalism, but these remained controversial due to his role in suppressing the left wing, a role for which he had been declared a fascist.

== After the fall of communism ==

With both Bulgaria and Yugoslavia under Communist rule, there was no scope for IMRO&#x27;s revival.

=== North Macedonia ===

After the fall of Communism in 1989 Yugoslavia began promptly to disintegrate and multi-partyism to emerge. Many exiles returned to Macedonia from abroad, and a new generation of young Macedonian intellectuals rediscovered the history of Macedonian nationalism. In these circumstances, it was not surprising that the IMRO name was revived. A new IMRO was founded on 17 June 1990 in Skopje. Although IMRO claims a line descent from the old IMRO, there is no real connection between the old IMRO and the new one. The party is called the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (In , or VMRO-DPMNE) describes itself as a Christian Democratic party which supports the admission of Macedonia to NATO and the European Union.

A minor political party carrying the name IMRO is the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization–People&#x27;s Party (VMRO-NP). Although a separate structure since the split in 2004, the political line of VMRO-NP is reminiscent of VMRO-DPMNE&#x27;s and its members maintain close ties with the latter&#x27;s party structure.

=== Bulgaria ===

A distinct IMRO-related organization was also revived in Bulgaria after 1989, first under the name VMRO-SMD (ВМРО-СМД), commonly known as VMRO, in the form of a cultural organisation. In 1996, the leaders of the organisation registered it as a political party in Bulgaria under the name VMRO – Bulgarian National Movement (ВМРО – Българско национално движение), or ВМРО–БНД (VMRO-BNM). This group continues to maintain that ethnic Macedonians are in fact Bulgarians.

A small spin-off from VMRO-BNM existed between 2010 and 2014, named VMRO – National Ideal for Unity (ВМРО – Национален идеал за единство), or ВМРО–НИЕ (VMRO-NIU), which used VMRO-BND&#x27;s flag. In 2014, NIU merged into the National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria.

<text>The Church of Greece (, ), part of the wider Greek Orthodox Church, is one of the autocephalous churches which make up the communion of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Its canonical territory is confined to the borders of Greece prior to the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 (&quot;Old Greece&quot;), with the rest of Greece (the &quot;New Lands&quot;, Crete, and the Dodecanese) being subject to the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. However, most of the dioceses of the Metropolises of the New Lands are &quot;de facto&quot; administered as part of the Church of Greece for practical reasons, under an agreement between the churches of Athens and Constantinople. The primate of the Church of Greece is the archbishop of Athens and All Greece.

==Prevailing religion of Greece==
Adherence to the Eastern Orthodox Church was established as a definitive hallmark of Greek ethnic identity in the first modern Greek constitution, the &quot;Epidaurus Law&quot; of 1822, during the Greek War of Independence. The preamble of all subsequent Greek constitutions simply states &quot;In the name of the Holy, Consubstantial, and Indivisible Trinity&quot; and the &quot;Orthodox Church of Christ&quot; is established as the &quot;prevailing&quot; religion of Greece.

Mainstream Orthodox clergy salaries and pensions are paid by the State, at rates comparable to those of teachers. The church had previously compensated the State by a tax of 35% on ordinary revenues of the church but, in 2004, this tax was abolished by &quot;Law 3220/2004&quot;. By virtue of its status as the prevailing religion, the canon law of the Church is recognized by the Greek government in matters pertaining to church administration. This is governed by the &quot;Constitution of the Church of Greece&quot;, which was voted by Parliament into law. Religious marriages and baptisms are legally equivalent to their civil counterparts and the relevant certificates are issued by officiating clergy. All Greek Orthodox students in primary and secondary schools in Greece attend religious instruction. Liaisons between church and state are handled by the Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs.

== Church hierarchy ==

Supreme authority is vested in the synod of all the diocesan bishops who have metropolitan status (the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece, Greek: &quot;Hierà Sýnodos tês Ekklēsías tês Helládos&quot; ) under the &quot;de jure&quot; presidency of the Archbishop of Athens and all Greece. This synod deals with general church issues. The Standing Synod is under the same presidency, and consists of the Primate and 12 bishops; each members serves for one term on a rotating basis and deals with administrative details.

The church is organized into 81 dioceses, of which 36, located in northern Greece and in the major islands in the north and northeast Aegean, are nominally and spiritually under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Patriarchate retains certain privileges over and in them—for example, their bishops have to acknowledge the Patriarch as their own primate during prayers. They are called the &quot;New Lands&quot; (Νέαι Χώραι, or &quot;Néai Chōrai&quot;) as they became part of the modern Greek state only after the Balkan Wars, and are represented by 6 of the 12 bishops of the Standing Synod. A bishop elected to one of the Sees of the New Lands has to be confirmed by the Patriarch of Constantinople before assuming his duties. These dioceses are administered by the Church of Greece &quot;in stewardship&quot; and their bishops retain their right of appeal (the &quot;ékklēton&quot;) to the Patriarch.

The dioceses of Crete (Church of Crete), the Dodecanese, and the Monastic state of Holy Mount Athos remain under the direct jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople; they are not part of the Church of Greece. The Archdiocese of Crete enjoys semiautonomous status: new bishops are elected by the local Synod of incumbents, and the Archbishop is appointed by the Ecumenical Patriarchate from a three-person list (the &quot;triprósōpon&quot;) drawn by the Greek Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs from among the incumbent Metropolitans of Crete.
==Clergy and monastics==
As in other Orthodox Christian churches, male graduates of seminaries run by the church (and financed by the Greek State), may be ordained as deacons and eventually priests. They are allowed to marry before their ordination as deacons, but not afterwards. The vast majority of parish clergy in Greece are married. Alternatively, they may enter monasteries and/or take monastic vows. Monastics who are ordained as priests, and possess a university degree in theology, are eligible as candidates for the episcopate (archimandrites). Women may also take monastic vows and become nuns, but they are not ordained.

Monasteries are either affiliated to their local diocese, or directly to one of the Orthodox Patriarchates; in the latter case they are called &quot;Stauropegiac&quot; monasteries (&quot;Stayropēgiaká&quot;, &quot;springs of the Cross&quot;).

==Old Calendarists==
A split (schism) occurred within the church in 1924 when the Holy Synod decided to replace the Old Calendar (Julian) with a hybrid calendar—the so-called &quot;Revised Julian Calendar&quot;—which maintained a modified Julian dating method for Pascha while adopting the Gregorian Calendar date for fixed feasts. Those who refused to adopt this change are known as Old Calendarists (&quot;palaioimerologites&quot; in Greek) and still follow the old Julian Calendar. They themselves have suffered several schisms, and not all Old Calendarists comprise one church. They refer to themselves as &quot;Genuine Orthodox Christians&quot;. The largest group associating itself with Old Calendarists is the Synod of deceased Archbishop Chrysostomos II Kioussis (Kallinikos Sarantopoulos as of today). This Synod obtained government recognition as a valid Orthodox church, although it is not in communion with the Church of Greece nor with the other Eastern Orthodox churches.

==History==


Greece was an early center of Christianity. Upon formation of the Patriarchate, the Church was formerly a part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Under Ottoman rule, the Muslims exercised no control over the church. With the establishment of the Greek kingdom, however, the government decided to take control of the church, breaking away from the patriarch in Constantinople. The government declared the church to be autocephalous in 1833 in a political decision of the Bavarian Regents acting for King Otto, who was a minor. The decision roiled Greek politics for decades as royal authorities took increasing control. The new status was finally recognized as such by the Patriarchate in 1850, under compromise conditions with the issue of a special &quot;Tomos&quot; decree which brought it back to a normal status. As a result, it retains certain special links with the &quot;mother church&quot;. There were only four bishops, and they had political roles.

In 1833, Parliament dissolved 400 small monasteries having fewer than five monks or nuns. These monasteries played an important role in preserving the Greek language along with arts and tradition through generations of monks. Priests were not salaried; in rural areas they were peasant farmers themselves, dependent for their livelihood on their farm work and from fees and offerings by parishioners. Their ecclesiastical duties were limited to administering the sacraments, supervising funerals, the blessings of crops, and exorcism. Few attended seminaries. By the 1840s, there was a nationwide revival, run by travelling preachers. The government arrested several and tried to shut down the revival, but it proved too powerful when the revivalists denounced three bishops for purchasing their office. By the 1880s the &quot;Anaplasis&quot; (&quot;Regeneration&quot;) Movement led to renewed spiritual energy and enlightenment. It fought against the rationalistic and materialistic ideas that had seeped in from secular Western Europe. It promoted catechism schools and Bible study circles.

===Zoë movement===
The 20th-century religious revival was led by the Zoë movement, which was founded in 1911. It&#x27;s a christian sect that deviates away from the principles of Greek Orthodox Church. Based in Athens but operating in decentralized fashion, it reached a membership of laymen as well as some priests. The main activities include publications and the nationwide Sunday School movement in 7,800 churches reaching 150,000 students. Zoë sponsored numerous auxiliaries and affiliated groups, including organizations for professional men, youth, parents, and young women nurses. A strong effort was made to circulate Bibles, illustrated novels, pamphlets, and other religious materials. A liturgical movement encouraged the laity to a greater awareness in the Eucharist, and more frequent Communion. Seminaries were built in the 20th century, but most of the graduates entered teaching rather than parish work. In 1920, only 800 of Greece&#x27;s 4,500 priests had any education beyond the elementary level. By 1959, out of 7,000 priests no more than five percent had completed university and seminary training. Monastic life declined sharply, although it continued at remote Mount Athos. Routine church life was highly disrupted by the Second World War and subsequent civil war, with many churches burned, and hundreds of priests and monks killed by the Germans on the one hand or the Communists on the other.

== Administration and Hierarchy of the Throne ==
Head of the Church of Greece and of the Holy Synod is Archbishop Ieronymos II (Ioannis Liapis), Archbishop of Athens and All Greece (2008–).

<text>The South-West State of Somalia
(), (Af-Maay: &quot;Koofur Orsé&quot;), is a Federal Member State in southwestern Somalia. It was founded by Hasan Muhammad Nur Shatigadud, leader of the Somalia RRA on 1 April 2002. It was the third autonomous region to be established.

After its dissolution in 2005, the territory was re-established in November 2009 as an official federal member state of Somalia. Abdiaziz Laftagareen was selected the president of this state. The official capital of South-West state is Barawa, located on the coast of the Somali Sea, though the state administration is currently based in Baidoa.

==Location and name==
The South West state is bordered to the north by Ethiopia, to the west by Jubbaland, to the east by Hirshabelle, and to the south by the Somali Sea. To the southeast, it is also bordered by Banaadir, whose administrative status was unclear during the 2010s.

During its development phase, the regional state of was called the Interim South West Administration. Its full name was the South West State of Somalia and, in Somali, &quot;Maamul Goboleedka Koonfur Galbeed&quot;. In the local Maay Maay language it is referred to as &quot;Koofur Orsi&quot;. An individual from Koofur Orsi is called a Koofur Orsian.

== History==
===Background===
During the pre-independence period, when the &quot;Koofur Orsi&quot; or &quot;Koonfur-Galbeed&quot; region was administered by the United Nations Trusteeship, the majority segment population of &quot;Digil and Mirifle&quot; were the only major Somali demographic whose political groups and spokesmen voiced apprehension about a centralized unitary republic. Many of these spokesmen voiced a preference for some form of confederalism or federalism. Several decades after independence, opposition to Siad Barre&#x27;s &quot;Hantiwadaag&quot; (socialist) government grew. When in 1990 the three major opposition factions of SPM, USC, and SNM met in Ethiopia and put forth an informal accord in favor of federalism, many civil servants from the &quot;Konfuur-Galbeed&quot; region argued that, in retrospect, the predecessors in their region were correct. In 1992, the blockage of aid supplies from the coast to the &quot;Konfuur-Galbeed&quot; region meant that many viewed the famine as man-made. This increased support for federalism. One form of criticism that was levelled at the &quot;Konfuur-Galbeed&quot; administration during its early development is that some of its functional facets hearkened back to the negative aspects of the era of the historically conterminous Geledi. The latter&#x27;s tributary status was believed to inculcate subordinacy rather than self-sufficiency, an administration that was oligarchical rather than egalitarian, and too much contrast with the historically British Jubaland to its west and south.

===Contemporary===
The territory known as the Southwestern State of Somalia (Somali: &quot;Dowlad Goboleedka Koonfur-Galbeed ee Soomaaliya&quot;), or locally Koofur Orsi, was originally intended to consist of six Somali administrative regions: (&quot;gobollo&quot;): Bay, Bakool, Middle Jubba (&quot;Jubbada Dhexe&quot;), Lower Shabelle (&quot;Shabeellada Hoose&quot;), Gedo and Lower Jubba (&quot;Jubbada Hoose&quot;). The establishment of the autonomous state was intended to express the disaffection of the Somalia State with the nascent Mogadishu-based Transitional National Government. It was also intended to counter the influence of the Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council in the same regions. In 2005, the state was dissolved after its leader Shatigadud had joined the Transitional Federal Parliament in November 2004. He became Minister of Finance in January 2005 in the Transitional Federal Government, successor to the Transitional National Government.

The coast of Koofur Orsi is primarily settled by Biimaal clan, but also the Barwani, other coastal Banadiri communities, and the Sheekhaal. The interior and the bulk of Koofur Orsi are populated mainly by the Rahanweyn clan, who are located between the Hawiye to the east in Hirshabelle, and the Marehan and other Darod clans to the west in Jubaland.
==Politics==

===Conventions===
In December 2013, a convention began in Baidoa between Federal Government officials and local representatives with the aim of establishing an autonomous state in the area under the Provision Federal Constitution. Two simultaneous political processes for the establishment of a new Southwestern State of Somalia were underway: one led by former Parliament Speaker Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan, which proposed a three-region state consisting of the Bay, Bakool and Lower Shabelle provinces; another led by traditional elders of Digil Mirifle, which proposed instead the re-establishment of a six-region Southwestern Somalia state consisting of the Bay, Bakool and Lower Shabelle, Gedo, Middle Jubba and Lower Jubba provinces.

===Presidency===
On 3 March 2014, Ali Hassan Abdirahman
was elected president by supporters of the six-region state proposal. Internal and Federal Affairs Minister Abdullahi Godah Barre indicated that the Somali federal government would not recognize the six-region convention outcome, as it contravenes an earlier Jubba agreement signed in Addis Ababa between the Somali federal authorities and the autonomous Jubbaland administration in southwestern Somalia. The Jubba agreement stipulates that Jubaland&#x27;s constituent provinces are instead to be administered by the Jubaland regional authorities. Addressing the 425th meeting of the AU Peace and Security Council on 25 March 2014, UN Special Representative for Somalia Nicholas Kay similarly indicated that he would continue to work closely with the AU, EU and IGAD to support a Somali federal government-led three-region state formation process for the southwestern provinces.

On 27 March 2014, 733 delegates in Baidoa representing the Bay, Bakool and Lower Shabelle regions elected Mohamed Haji Abdinur as president of the Southwestern State of Somalia. Abdinur is a veteran politician and a close ally of former Parliament Speaker Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan. Of the representatives that took part in the three-region state elections, 723 voted in favor of Abdinur while 10 abstained.

On 30 March 2014, the President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud visited Baidoa to defuse political tension between the two competing Southwestern State delegations. The autonomous Puntland regional administration in northeastern Somalia issued a statement the following day congratulating Abdinur on his election as president of the Southwestern State. The Puntland State House also expressed support for the three-region state process in Baidoa and indicated that the Puntland authorities were prepared to provide technical and experience-related assistance to the nascent federal state.

== Allotment ==
On 22 June 2014, the federal government concluded its mediation between the supporters of the parallel three-region and six-region processes for a new Southwestern State of Somalia. Wings from both sides had reportedly reached an agreement on the prospective regional state&#x27;s formation. On 23 June 2014, the office of Federal Parliament Speaker Mohamed Osman Jawari hosted an event announcing the merger of the two competing administrations into a single three-region state, which is to be composed of the Bay, Bakool and Lower Shabelle provinces.

== Koofur Galbeed administration ==

=== Establishment ===
On 23 June 2014, President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed, and Parliament Speaker Mohamed Osman Jawari oversaw a ceremony in Mogadishu marking the merger of the two competing administrations into a single three-region state, which is to be composed of the Bay, Bakool and Lower Shabelle provinces. The pact stipulates that the new polity will be led by an Interim South West Administration consisting of representatives from both sides. According to an official press communique, the opposing sides are slated to form a thirteen-member technical committee, appointing five members apiece to the body alongside three members selected by the Federal Government. The panel is then within ten days scheduled to prepare a roadmap for the interim administration&#x27;s formation. Additionally, the Federal Government is to facilitate consultations between the Interim South West Administration and Jubaland over mutual concerns and interests. The UN Special Representative for Somalia Nicholas Kay, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Mission Commission for Somalia Mahamat Saleh Annadif, and the U.S. Special Representative for Somalia James P. McAnulty all welcomed the Southwestern State of Somalia agreement, commended the principals on their constructive consultations, acknowledged the Federal Government&#x27;s key role in facilitating the talks, and pledged to continue supporting the local post-conflict reconstruction process. On 25 June 2014, the federal cabinet unanimously approved the signed accord.

On 16 July 2014, the establishment of the Technical Committee on Formation of Interim South West Administration was announced and endorsed at a formal ceremony in Mogadishu. The panel is to be supported by a group of federal ministers under the authority of the Prime Minister.

In September 2014, Parliament Speaker Mohamed Osman Jawari and UN Special Representative for Somalia Nicholas Kay visited Baidoa to finalize talks over the South West state&#x27;s formation. Jawari subsequently announced that a reconciliation conference would be held in the city on 14 September to unify the competing three-region and six-region local administrations. Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed opened the summit, which was attended by Lower Shabelle, Bay and Bakool provincial representatives, clan elders and politicians.

In October 2014, President Mohamud opened a state formation conference in Baidoa for the three-region Southwestern State of Somalia. The UN-financed summit was attended by 380 delegates from the state&#x27;s constituent Bay, Bakool and Lower Shabelle provinces, as well as UN Envoy to Somalia Nicholas Kay, IGAD Envoy to Somalia Mohamed Abdi Affey, and the Ambassador of Denmark to Somalia, among other officials. On 7 November 2014, the Southwestern State of Somalia was established, following the conclusion of the two-week Baidoa conference. The delegates from the new regional state&#x27;s constituent Bay, Bakool and Lower Shabelle provinces unanimously agreed to make Barawe its capital. They also approved a new regional state constitution. On 17 November 2014, former Parliament Speaker Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan was elected President of the three-region Southwestern State of Somalia.

On 17 December 2014, the six-region South West Somalia administration joined the finalized three-region South West Somalia administration. The merger came after a power-sharing agreement signed in Baidoa between both sides, which stipulates that the South West Somalia six-region&#x27;s leadership will be granted the new federal state&#x27;s vice president and parliament speaker positions.

On 30 December 2014, South West State President Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan and Jubaland President Ahmed Mohamed Islam (Madobe) signed a four-point Memorandum of Understanding on federalization, security, the 2016 general elections, trade, and the constitution. The bilateral accord was signed in the presence of representatives from the two regional states, including politicians, traditional leaders and civil society activists. Among the clauses of the accord were equitable allocation of international assistance by the federal authorities, agreeing on pre-civil war boundaries and regional demarcations established by the military government, and recommending that the federal authorities both delegate powers to regional bodies and adopt a No Objection Policy. Additionally, the memorandum stipulates that the two regional states will form a security committee consisting of representatives from both administrations, which will facilitate launching joint counterinsurgency operations, extradition, and expertise and intelligence sharing. The two administrations also proposed the creation of an interstate commission to liaise between the federal government and constituent regional states. They likewise indicated that their respective Chambers of Commerce would buttress commercial exchanges and cross-border trade.

== Elections ==
As a part of the continuing federalization processes of Somalia and fostering local democracy, the South West State has planned to have own presidential elections on 17 November 2018. It is first time the people of Southwestern State to have the opportunity to elect their leader. The election is an expression of the political will of the Somali people in the state.

The incumbent president is determined to cling to power but there was growing opposition against him. Where the Federal Government of Somalia wanted their handpicked candidate to win the election at any cost. Over 10 independents candidates have created Council of Change, umbrella uniting all candidates except the incumbent and the Government sponsored candidate. However, the election process was tainted and hindered by politically motivated actions of both the Federal Government of Somalia and the interim SW administration. The following events have thrown the Southwestern State election into disarray: 
# The increasing tension between Federal Government of Somalia and Federal Member States has adversely affected the election process. 
# The Federal Government&#x27;s ill-advised action targeting Sheikh Mukhtar Robow with the intention to eliminate him from the electoral process. 
# Prolonged delays in forming the election committee.
# Twin bombing on 13 October in Baidoa targeting venues affiliated with two independent candidates which as many as 30 people was killed.
# The resignation of 15 members of the election committee including the chairman, his deputy and secretariat citing deep dismay over interference by the Federal Government of Somalia in the process.
# The absence of election ant-corruption committee despite asking ISWA several occasions. 
# Abrupt resignation of the President of the South West State Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan and his decision not to run for the presidential seat, succumbing pressure from the Federal Government of Somalia.

The elections, which were initially slated for 17 November was postponed to 28 November. It was then pushed further back to 5 December and once again it has been postponed to 19 December becoming the 4th time.

Mukhtar Robow was officially cleared by the South West State Electoral Commission to contest in the December elections despite early protest by the Federal government seeking to have him barred. 
The Coalition for Change, which has thrown its weight behind Mukhtar Robow, issued a statement after the polls were postponed. The group said it fears the government is planning to rig because the new date is not favourable for international observers as most of them will then have left Somalia for the end of the year festivities.

Some 150 elite Somali forces, armed to the tooth with some really heavy calibre machine guns, were deployed to Baidoa to physically block Robow from accessing the election venue.

On 7 Nov 2018 The United Nations Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) warned of presidential election in Somalia&#x27;s South West State have the potential to lead to violence and called on all parties to ensure that the electoral process proceeds in accordance with the established rules and avoids any behaviour which may lead to conflict or undermine the integrity of the electoral process.

Mukhtar Robow was then invited to a security brief by African Union peacekeepers from Ethiopia on Thursday 13 December. He was then forcibly abducted, transferred to the custody of the National Intelligence and Security Agency (Somalia) and flown to Mogadishu under tight security. At least 12 people were killed in Baidoa in violence that erupted following Robow&#x27;s arrest. Among those killed was a member of the regional parliament. The victims were shot by AMISOM Ethiopian forces and Somali Special Forces flown from Mogadishu. Somali lawmakers have written a protest letter to the AU Commission in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian government and the UN complaining about the conduct of AMISOM. His arrest also prompted the resignation of Somalia&#x27;s Public Works Minister Abdifatah Mohamed Gesey, who hails from Baidoa and is from the same Leysan sub-clan as Robow, to resign in protest.

Abdiaziz Laftagareen was on 19 December 2018, elected President of South West State in an arranged sham election that was predetermined and rigged in his favour. The Ethiopian contingent of the African peacekeepers provided security during the voting. It was alleged approximately $15 million to $20 million of Qatar funding was spent on this sham process.

On 1 January 2019 Somalia declared the UN&#x27;s chief diplomat, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General, Nicholas Haysom,‘persona non grata’. The accusation was that interference in a sovereign state&#x27;s internal affairs after Haysom wrote to the Government questioning the legality of the arrest of Mukhtar Robow and Police killing of 15 protesters. Just hours before the Somali government&#x27;s letter of expulsion was released to the media, two U.N. staff members and a contractor were injured after seven mortars landed inside the U.N. compound in the Somali capital, Mogadishu. In a statement the UN Security Council is deeply regretted the Government&#x27;s decision.

<text>The Battle of the Java Sea (, ) was a decisive naval battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II.

Allied navies suffered a disastrous defeat at the hand of the Imperial Japanese Navy on 27 February 1942 and in secondary actions over successive days, starting when the main ABDA fleet strike force of 2 heavy cruisers, 3 light cruisers, and 9 destroyers, led by ABDA fleet&#x27;s main commander, Admiral Karel Doorman, attempted to intercept a Japanese troop convoy in the Java Sea, only to be intercepted by the convoy&#x27;s better equipped escort force. The battle started off as a stalemate, but the heavy cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot; changed the course of the battle when she crippled the heavy cruiser HMS &quot;Exeter&quot; with gunfire, then torpedoed and sank the Dutch destroyer &quot;Kortenaer,&quot; sending Doorman&#x27;s fleet into a chaotic frenzy. A gunfight between allied and Japanese destroyers then resulted in the sinking of HMS &quot;Electra&quot;, before Doorman&#x27;s force made a false retreat, ending the daylight engagement.

However, under the cover of night, Admiral Doorman&#x27;s ships attempted another attack, during which the destroyer HMS &quot;Jupiter&quot; accidentally hit a Dutch mine and sank, but the Japanese immediately caught on to their plan, prompting the &quot;Haguro&quot; and her sistership &quot;Nachi&quot; to ambush the allied fleet with a stealthy long range torpedo attack. One of &quot;Nachi&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes hit the Dutch light cruiser &quot;Java&quot;, which was instantly blown apart and sank with almost all hands. One of &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes then hit the allied flagship, the Dutch light cruiser &quot;De Ruyter&quot;, which sank to progressive flooding over several hours, killing Admiral Doorman.

The aftermath of the battle included several smaller actions around Java, including the smaller but also significant Battle of Sunda Strait, which saw the sinking of the heavy cruiser USS &quot;Houston&quot;&quot;,&quot; the light cruiser HMAS &quot;Perth&quot;, and the destroyer HNLMS &quot;Evertsen&quot;, and the second battle of the Java Sea, where the still crippled &quot;Exeter&quot; and her escorting destroyers were sunk by a Japanese cruiser destroyer squadron, including &quot;Haguro&quot;. These defeats led to the dissolution of the ABDA fleet as a whole, the scuttling of the Dutch navy, and the Japanese occupation of the entire Dutch East Indies.

==Background==
The Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies progressed at a rapid pace as the Japanese advanced from their Palau Islands colony and captured bases in Sarawak and the southern Philippines. They seized bases in eastern Borneo and in northern Celebes while troop convoys, screened by destroyers and cruisers with air support provided by swarms of fighters operating from captured bases, steamed southward through the Makassar Strait and into the Molucca Sea. Opposing the invading forces was a small force consisting of Dutch, American, British and Australian warships, many of them of World War I vintage, initially under the command of American Admiral Thomas C. Hart.

On 23 January 1942 a force of four American destroyers attacked a Japanese invasion convoy in Makassar Strait as it approached Balikpapan in Borneo. On 13 February the Japanese captured the major port of Palembang in eastern Sumatra. On the night of 19/20 February, an Allied force attacked the Japanese eastern invasion force off Bali in the Battle of Badung Strait. Also on 19 February, the Japanese made two air raids on Darwin, on the Australian mainland, one from carrier-based planes and the other by land-based planes, rendering Darwin useless as a supply and naval base to support operations in the East Indies.

==Battle==

=== Prelude ===
Japanese amphibious forces gathered to strike at Java, and on 27 February 1942 the main Allied naval force, under Rear Admiral Karel Doorman, sailed northeast from Surabaya to intercept a convoy of the Japanese eastern invasion force approaching from the Makassar Strait. The Allied eastern strike force consisted of two heavy cruisers (HMS &quot;Exeter&quot; and USS &quot;Houston&quot;), three light cruisers (Doorman&#x27;s flagship HNLMS &quot;De Ruyter&quot;, HNLMS &quot;Java&quot;, HMAS &quot;Perth&quot;), and nine destroyers (HMS &quot;Electra&quot;, HMS &quot;Encounter&quot;, HMS &quot;Jupiter&quot;, HNLMS &quot;Kortenaer&quot;, HNLMS &quot;Witte de With&quot;, USS &quot;Alden&quot;, USS &quot;John D. Edwards&quot;, USS &quot;John D. Ford&quot;, and USS &quot;Paul Jones&quot;). On paper, this seemed a formidable force, but its combat effectiveness was questionable. Belonging to several different navies, the ships had practically no experience in each other&#x27;s naval doctrine and fighting styles, and most crucially there was a language barrier between the Dutch speaking Karel Doorman and the English-speaking US, UK, and Australian ships, hindering communications.

Upon departure, the Allied force was immediately spotted by a Japanese floatplane launched from the convoy&#x27;s main protection force, commanded by Rear Admiral Takeo Takagi. The main Japanese group consisted of the heavy cruisers &quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot; (the latter, Takagi&#x27;s flagship, having launched the floatplane), and the destroyers &quot;Kawakaze&quot;, &quot;Yamakaze&quot;, &quot;Ushio&quot;, and &quot;Sazanami&quot;. This was supported by second group led by Rear Admiral Shoji Nishimura, consisting of the light cruisers &quot;Naka&quot; and &quot;Jintsū&quot; and the destroyers &quot;Yūdachi&quot;, &quot;Samidare&quot;, &quot;Murasame&quot;, &quot;Harusame&quot;, &quot;Minegumo&quot;, and &quot;Asagumo&quot;. Upon learning of the opposing force&#x27;s movements from &quot;Nachi&quot;, both groups sailed aside each other at 30 knots to intercept the opposing force. The Japanese heavy cruisers, with ten 8-inch (203 mm) guns each and superb torpedoes. By comparison, &quot;Exeter&quot; was armed only with six 8-inch guns, and only six of &quot;Houston&quot;&#x27;s nine 8-inch guns remained operable after her aft turret had been knocked out in an earlier air attack. While underway, Nishimura&#x27;s group was joined by the nearby destroyers &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;, &quot;Hatsukaze&quot;, and &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot;, before being attacked by land based Dutch aircraft and B-17 bombers, but avoided damage due to the planes&#x27; poor marksmanship. Captain Tameichi Hara aboard &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; noted that the planes attacked the Japanese warships, confirming their goal was to mow through the protection force before attacking the convoy and believing it to have been a mistake by the planes to have not attacked the troopships.

The next day, Doorman&#x27;s force was tracked by &quot;Nachi&#x27;s&quot; floatplane while the Japanese fleet rigorously practiced in preparation for the coming engagement. Updates from &quot;Nachi&#x27;s&quot; floatplane worried the Japanese, as Doorman&#x27;s ships were in a position to pounce on the vulnerable transport ships, but Doorman ordered his fleet to turn South to refuel at Surabaya. However, upon receiving reports of the Japanese fleet, Doorman immediately turned his ships back to attack the enemy. These actions, perhaps somewhat misunderstood, came as a relief to Admiral Takagi, who Captain Hara recalled saying &quot;The enemy ships were staying clear of our air raids on Surabaya, the enemy is in no shape to fight us.&quot; He ordered the convoy to turn around and the escort ships to form up into a fighting formation.

=== Afternoon battle ===
At 15:48 on 27 February 1942, &quot;Amatsukaze&#x27;s&quot; chief spotter Shigeru Iwata located Doorman&#x27;s fleet at 31,600 yards. Captain Hara watched through his binoculars, clearly recognizing &quot;De Ruyter&#x27;s&quot; masts as the fleet quickly became visible to the other ships. Admiral Doorman aboard &quot;De Ruyter&quot; in turn located the enemy force, with a brief scare due to a mistaken claim of battleships in the enemy formation, which was quickly corrected. Still, the allies could not make out any targets besides &quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot; because of the inferiority of their optical systems to those of the Japanese, because only one of Doorman&#x27;s ships, the &quot;Exeter&quot;, carried any form of radar, and because of the language barrier on the Allied side. Still, Doorman ordered his ships to turn west, hoping to prevent the Japanese fleet from crossing his T. With both fleets thereafter sailing in a parallel course, &quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot;, which were training behind the other ships, could catch up to Nishimura&#x27;s group.

By 16:00, spotters on the &quot;Electra&quot; noticed &quot;Jintsū&quot;, leading &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;, &quot;Hatsukaze&quot;, &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot;, at 16,000 yards, and her 4.7-inch (12 cm) guns fired the first shots of the battle, closely followed by all the cruisers and several destroyers. Every ship aimed their guns at &quot;Jintsū&quot;, straddling her several times, but not a single shell made its mark. The &quot;Naka&quot; and her group of destroyers returned fire at 24,000 yards, and their shells, too, all missed their mark. Both sides rapidly closed the distance and, frustrated by the ineffective gunfire, Nishimura ordered &quot;Naka&quot; and his destroyers to fire torpedoes at 15,000 yards, letting out 43 torpedoes. A few exploded after running a few thousand yards, while the rest all missed their target. Nishimura&#x27;s hastiness to engage at long range was later criticized by the Japanese admiralty due to the sheer amount of ammunition the Japanese wasted with few hits in the initial stages of the battle. Recognizing this flaw, Takagi ordered all ships to close the range and charge the enemy as he watched his heavy cruisers blast away at long range.

==== First hits are scored ====
&quot;Exeter&quot;, &quot;Houston&quot;, and &quot;Perth&quot; all fired on &quot;Haguro&quot; and initially claimed to have blown up and sunk her. In fact, &quot;Haguro&quot; was untouched, as she and &quot;Nachi&quot; scored the first hits of the battle. &quot;Haguro&quot; focused her gunfire on &quot;De Ruyter&quot;, striking her with an 8-inch (203 mm) shell that blasted apart her auxillary motor room, starting a fire that killed one crewman and injured six others. A second 8-inch (203 mm) shell from &quot;Haguro&quot; punched through &quot;De Ruyter&#x27;s&quot; unarmored portions without exploding. Meanwhile, Admiral Takagi&#x27;s flagship focused her fire on &quot;Houston&quot;, which &quot;Nachi&quot; succeeded in hitting with two 8-inch (203 mm) shells, one punching through her bow and the other holing her stern, which managed to rupture an oil tank. Even when their shells didn&#x27;t directly hit, near-miss and straddle damage still took a toll, &quot;Nachi&#x27;s&quot; shells landing as little as 3 yards from &quot;Houston&quot;.

A cluster of Japanese destroyers, &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot;, &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;, &quot;Hatsukaze&quot;, &quot;Yamakaze&quot;, &quot;Kawakaze&quot;, and &quot;Ushio&quot; closed the range by Takagi&#x27;s order, in the hope of enabling more accurate torpedoing. &quot;Electra&quot; switched fire to the cluster as 5.9-inch (15 cm) shells from &quot;De Ruyter&quot; continued to rain on the column. One of &quot;Electra&#x27;s&quot; 4.7-inch (12 cm) shells hit &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot;, causing thick white smoke to burst out of the ship, blinding &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; behind her. A near miss from &quot;De Ruyter&quot; then lightly damaged &quot;Amatsukaze&#x27;s&quot; hull and dashed water on her bridge. However, neither destroyer was critically damaged. In turn, the destroyers engaged in a gunfight with &quot;De Ruyter&quot;, although no shells hit their mark. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; and &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot; first let out 16 torpedoes at 6,000 yards, followed closely by &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;, then the four other destroyers behind her. A total of 56 torpedoes were aimed at the enemy, yet not a single hit was made.

==== Haguro changes the course of the battle ====
Though the torpedoes did not hit, they prompted the allied fleet to maneuver, enabling &quot;Haguro&quot; to switch fire from &quot;De Ruyter&quot; to the &quot;Exeter&quot;, with &quot;Exeter&quot; responding back. Engaging each other at 22,000 yards, &quot;Exeter&#x27;s&quot; gunnery was poor, managing only a straddle by the 8th salvo. &quot;Haguro&quot; proved more effective, scoring her first 8-inch (203 mm) shell hit, which did not explode. Another salvo from &quot;Haguro&quot; registered a devastating hit on &quot;Exeter&quot;. One of &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; 8-inch (203 mm) shells gouged into &quot;Exeter&#x27;s&quot; engine. It exploded and destroyed six of &quot;Exeter&#x27;s&quot; eight boilers, killing 40 men as &quot;Exeter&#x27;s&quot; speed dropped to 5 knots. Doorman&#x27;s fleet then maneuvered chaotically, as, when &quot;Exeter&quot; began to retreat, &quot;Houston&quot;, &quot;Perth&quot;, and &quot;Java&quot; all followed her, assuming they had missed a command form Doorman, leaving &quot;De Ruyter&quot; charging alone at the enemy fleet before joining the other cruisers. Simultaneously, &quot;Haguro&quot; fired a spread of 8 torpedoes and continued to engage. The British destroyers &quot;Jupiter&quot;, &quot;Encounter&quot;, and &quot;Electra&quot; came to assist the crippled &quot;Exeter&quot; as Doorman&#x27;s cruisers began to turn away, laying a smokescreen in an attempt to hide the disorganized formation.

Up to this point, the battle of the Java Sea had been something of a stalemate, with both sides missing their shots due to extreme range. Even when shells did hit, such as &quot;Haguro&quot;&#x27;s and &quot;Nachi&#x27;s&quot; hits to &quot;De Ruyter&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot; or &quot;Electa&#x27;s&quot; hit on &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot;, no significant damage was inflicted as the damaged ships were able to fight on. &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; hit on &quot;Exeter&quot; disorganized Doorman&#x27;s fleet. In an ironic twist, the only Japanese torpedo to make its mark during the course of the afternoon battle was one of &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; launched at extreme range and hitting home 15 minutes after firing, striking the Dutch destroyer &quot;Kortenaer&quot;. Within moments of the hit, the destroyer broke apart and sank with the loss of 66 men. Launched at a distance of 22,000 yards, this hit by &quot;Haguro&quot; was probably the longest-range torpedo hit in naval history.

==== Destroyer on destroyer action ====
The American destroyers &quot;Alden&quot;, &quot;John C Edwards&quot;, &quot;John C Ford&quot;, and &quot;Paul Jones&quot; fired their torpedoes at &quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot;, but none made their mark. Simultaneously, the British destroyers attempting to cover the crippled &quot;Exeter&quot; were engaged by the Japanese destroyers &quot;Asagumo&quot; and &quot;Minegumo&quot;. &quot;Minegumo&quot; stayed at a longer range and took part in a 1v2 against &quot;Jupiter&quot; and &quot;Encounter&quot;, lightly damaging them near with misses, but failed to score any direct hits. &quot;Asagumo&quot; and &quot;Electra&quot;, by contrast, engaged each other at point blank range. &quot;Asagumo&quot; took several 4.7-inch (12 cm) shells, temporarily leaving her dead in the water, killing five sailors and injuring 16 others. &quot;Asagumo&quot;, however, inflicted more damage than she received, a hail of 5-inch (127 mm) gunfire destroying &quot;Electra&#x27;s&quot; A and X turrets, engine room, communications, and electrical power, and setting &quot;Electra&quot; on fire. &quot;Electra&quot; desperately let out a spread of eight torpedoes at her opponent, but none hit, and in response &quot;Minegumo&quot; switched fire from the other destroyers and joined &quot;Asagumo&quot; in pounding the already crippled &quot;Electra&quot;. Western sources sometimes credit &quot;Jintsū&quot; with assisting &quot;Asagumo&quot;, but Japanese records do not support this. &quot;Electra&#x27;s&quot; remaining guns were destroyed, flooding overwhelmed damage control, and fires burned out of control under &quot;Asagumo&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Minegumo&#x27;s&quot; bombardment. &quot;Electra&#x27;s&quot; crew finally abandoned ship and left her to sink. &quot;Encounter&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot; had been repelled by &quot;Minegumo&#x27;s&quot; gunfire and retreated to assist &quot;Exeter&quot;.

=== Allied retreat ===
After almost two hours of fighting, Doorman&#x27;s ships had not even come close to attacking the Japanese troop convoy. One of his cruisers was crippled, two more were damaged, and he suffered two destroyers sunk, while his ships, with their poor gunnery, had managed only to moderately damage one destroyer and lightly damage two others. Doorman decided to cut his losses and retreat back to Surabaya. He still wanted to attack the convoy, but recognized that he simply could not under the current conditions. The limping &quot;Exeter&quot; broke off from the force, taking &quot;Encounter&quot; and &quot;Witte De With&quot; to escort her. While underway, they passed through the former battleground and rescued survivors from &quot;Kortenaer&quot; and &quot;Electra&quot;. The rest of the force headed in the direction of their home port, leading Takagi to believe the Allied ships had retreated to port. However, after nightfall, Doorman&#x27;s ships changed direction and steamed back toward the convoy.

==== Loss of all allied destroyers ====

However, the plan immediately began to backfire. The four American destroyers were dangerously low on fuel. They had completely expended their torpedoes and were limited to gun armament. The American destroyers accordingly detached from Doorman&#x27;s fleet to retire for Surabaya. Doorman still decided to absorb the losses and continued to charge on. However, at 21:25, Doorman&#x27;s lone remaining destroyer, the &quot;Jupiter&quot;, hit a mine and sank with the loss of 84 men. The mine that sank &quot;Jupiter&quot; is generally thought to have been not Japanese, but Dutch, lain by the Dutch minelayer &quot;Gouden Leeuw&quot;. With &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s&quot; sinking, Doorman had not a single destroyer in his force, leaving him only his remaining heavy cruiser &quot;Houston&quot; and light cruisers &quot;De Ruyter&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, and &quot;Perth&quot;. But Doorman charged on, still hoping for victory.

=== Night ambush ===
Unknown to Doorman, &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; floatplane had been tracking his force the entire time. Takagi believed he had secured a victory as his ships made post-battle reformations. &quot;Asagumo&#x27;s&quot; crew conducted temporary repairs following her gunfight with &quot;Electra&quot;, getting the engine back up and running as she regained speed, retiring from the engagement and taking &quot;Minegumo&quot; to escort her. &quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot; stopped in the water to recover their floatplanes, which had been catapulted shortly before the battle, but while this was being conducted, one of &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; floatplanes still in the air noticed Doorman&#x27;s fleet turning back, much to Takagi&#x27;s shock.

&quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot; instantly picked up speed and raced to engage the enemy yet again. &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; floatplane this time tracked Doorman&#x27;s every movement, which were now far more predictable than earlier in the battle. It was just before midnight that the Japanese optical systems picked up the enemy force at long range. Steaming at maximum speed, &quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot; closed to 16,000 yards. Low on ammunition for their main guns, they instead opted for a stealthy torpedo attack, in which &quot;Nachi&quot; unleashed eight torpedoes, and &quot;Haguro&quot; four.

At 23:32, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; rapidly turned to evade &quot;Nachi&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes, evading damage, but one of &quot;Nachi&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes continued on and gouged into the &quot;Java&#x27;s&quot; stern. The torpedo ignited the magazines to &quot;Java&#x27;s&quot; 5.9-inch (15 cm) main battery, and a massive explosion blew the cruiser apart in an instant. In under two minutes, &quot;Java&quot; sank, with only 19 of her crew of 526 surviving.

Four minutes later, one of &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes hit Admiral Doorman&#x27;s flagship. All power was destroyed as the &quot;De Ruyter&quot; stopped dead in the water with significant flooding, and a massive fire broke out and enveloped the cruiser. &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; torpedo hit killed much of &quot;De Ruyter&#x27;s&quot; damage control crew, and the loss of all power disabled much of &quot;De Ruyter&#x27;s&quot; damage control equipment, meaning the massive fire could spread throughout the ship. Simultaneously, flooding slowly overwhelmed damage control and &quot;De Ruyter&quot; increasingly listed. Over a period of three hours, fires and flooding overwhelmed &quot;De Ruyter&quot; as she capsized and sank with the loss of 367 men. Admiral Doorman and Captain Eugène Lacomblé were among the dead.

Shouts of &quot;Banzai&quot; could be heard from &quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Nachi&#x27;s&quot; decks as crew members leaped for joy and hugged each other in excitement. Admiral Takagi chose not to attack with gunfire afterwards, knowing &quot;Java&quot; and &quot;De Ruyter&quot; were already fatally damaged. The pair steamed out of the area to reinforce the invasion convoy. Depending on the source, they were either undetected, or were spotted but untouched by ineffective gunfire. With Doorman dead, &quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Perth&quot; abandoned the mission and retreated. Meanwhile, as the US destroyers evacuated the battlefield they ran into &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; and &quot;Hatsukaze&quot;. Both sides exchanged fire, but no hits were scored and the US destroyers continued on their path while &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; and &quot;Hatsukaze&quot; regrouped with the fleet.

With almost all of their ships sunk or damaged, the remaining allied warships halted all offensive actions and attempted to flee the vicinity, leaving the Dutch East Indies to the invaders. The Japanese convoys continued to Surabaya unmolested, aside from an air raid that damaged a single troopship. All the Allies had accomplished was that the troops on Java received a one-day respite, which ultimately changed nothing. &quot;Perth&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot; proceeded to Tanjung Priok, arriving later that day. However, oil shortages meant they could be only half fueled, and they received no new ammunition.

In the first battle of the Java Sea, not a single Japanese ship was sunk, and besides &quot;Electra&quot;, not a single allied ship even managed to hit a Japanese ship.

==Aftermath==
After their victory, the Japanese fleet while returning to the invasion convoy stumbled upon the Dutch hospital ship SS &quot;Op Ten Noort&quot; as she was sailed to the battle scene to rescue survivors&quot;.&quot; &quot;Op Ten Noort&quot; was halted by &quot;Murasame&quot; and &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;. Captain Hara aboard &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; peeked through his binoculars and watched Captain G. Tuizinga walk on deck after the Japanese yelled a message to the ship in English. Upon inspection, there were no patients on the ship, only crew and staff, and in response &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; was ordered to escort &quot;Op Ten Noort&quot; to Singapore, where she would be converted into a prison ship. While underway, &quot;Amatsukaze and Hatsukaze&quot; crippled the Dutch submarine &quot;K-10,&quot; forcing her scuttling a day later.

While traversing the Java Sea, &quot;Witte De With&quot; was damaged by land based Japanese aircraft and forced to retire for Surabaya. She was replaced by the destroyer USS &quot;Pope&quot; in escorting the crippled &quot;Exeter&quot; to safety.

===Battle of Sunda Strait===
&quot;Perth&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot; were at Tanjung Priok on 28 February when they received orders to sail through Sunda Strait to Tjilatjap. Materiel was running short in Java, and neither was able to rearm or fully refuel. Departing at 19:00 on 28 February for the Sunda Strait, by chance they encountered the main Japanese invasion fleet for West Java in Bantam Bay. The Allied ships were engaged by at least three cruisers and several destroyers.

In a ferocious night action that ended after midnight on 1 March, &quot;Perth&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot; were sunk. A Japanese minesweeper and a troop transport were sunk by friendly fire, while three other transports were damaged and had to be beached.

The Dutch destroyer HNLMS &quot;Evertsen&quot; had been scheduled to depart Tanjung Priok with the cruisers, but was delayed, and she followed them about two hours later. Her crew sighted the gunfire of the main action, and her captain managed to evade the Japanese main force. However, &quot;Evertsen&quot; was then engaged by two Japanese destroyers in the Strait, and on fire and in a sinking condition, grounded herself on a reef near Sebuku Island. The surviving crew abandoned ship just as the aft magazine exploded.

===Second Battle of the Java Sea===
After emergency repairs the badly-damaged &quot;Exeter&quot; left Surabaya for Ceylon; she departed at dusk on 28 February and limped toward Sunda Strait, escorted by the destroyers and . However, all three ships were intercepted by the Japanese heavy cruisers &quot;Nachi&quot;, &quot;Haguro&quot;, &quot;Myōkō&quot; and &quot;Ashigara&quot;—and their attendant destroyers—on the morning of 1 March. &quot;Exeter&quot; and &quot;Encounter&quot; were sunk together around noon, while &quot;Pope&quot; escaped only to be sunk several hours later by aerial attack.

===Bali Strait===
The four U.S. destroyers of DesDiv 58—&quot;John D. Edwards&quot;, &quot;John D. Ford&quot;, &quot;Alden&quot;, and &quot;Paul Jones&quot;—were also at Surabaya; they left for Australia via the harbor&#x27;s shallow eastern entrance at nightfall on 28 February. After a brief encounter with Japanese destroyers in the Bali Strait, which they were able to evade, they reached Fremantle safely on 4 March.

===Consequences===
Another Dutch destroyer (HNLMS &quot;Witte de With&quot;) and three American ships (destroyers USS &quot;Pillsbury&quot; and USS &quot;Edsall&quot;, along with the gunboat USS &quot;Asheville&quot;) were either scuttled or sunk as they attempted to escape to Australia. The main ABDA naval force had been almost totally destroyed: 10 ships and approximately 2,173 sailors had been lost. The Battle of the Java Sea ended significant Allied naval operations in Southeast Asia in 1942, and Japanese land forces invaded Java on 28 February. The Dutch surface fleet was practically eradicated from Asian waters and the Netherlands would never reclaim full control of its colony. The Japanese now controlled one of the most important food-producing regions (Java), and by conquering the Dutch East Indies, Japan also controlled the fourth-largest oil producing area in the world in 1940.

The U.S. and Royal Air Force retreated to Australia. Dutch troops, aided by British remnants, fought fiercely for a week. In the campaign the Japanese executed many Allied POWs and sympathizing Indonesians. Eventually, the Japanese won this decisive battle of attrition and ABDA forces surrendered on 9 March.

== Wrecks ==
As of 2002 the location of the wreck of only one of the eight ships sunk during the two so-called Java Sea Battles, HMS &quot;Jupiter&quot;, was known and plotted on an Admiralty chart. However, given her location in very shallow water so close to shore she had already been heavily salvaged.

In December 2002 the wrecks of HNLMS &quot;Java&quot; and HNLMS &quot;De Ruyter&quot; were discovered by a specialist wreck diving group aboard the dive vessel MV &quot;Empress&quot;. &quot;Empress&quot; then went on to discover the wrecks of HMS &quot;Electra&quot; in August 2003; HNLMS &quot;Kortenaer&quot; in August 2004; and HMS &quot;Exeter&quot; and HMS &quot;Encounter&quot; in February 2007. When discovered these wrecks were all in a very well-preserved state, save for battle damage. In late 2008, &quot;Empress&quot; discovered remnants of the last wreck, USS &quot;Pope&quot;, which had already been largely removed by illegal salvage diving operations.

Although the MV &quot;Empress&quot; team kept the locations of their discoveries secret, by 2017 all eight ships had been reduced to remnants or even entirely removed by illegal commercial salvage operations.&#x27;

Freeman&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Leonard W. Freeman, was a medic in the British Expeditionary Force during World War II and was killed in action at Dunkirk just a few days before the Dunkirk evacuation. Leonard&#x27;s father, Richard, was born blind and worked as a piano tuner and organist. 

Freeman was raised in his mother&#x27;s Catholic faith, and attended the Salesian School in Chertsey, Surrey, before attending Brooklands College in nearby Weybridge for media studies. His older brother, Tim, became a singer with the group Frazier Chorus.

==Career==

Freeman attended the Central School of Speech and Drama and has appeared in at least 18 TV shows, 14 theatre productions, and several radio productions. He became notable for his role as Tim Canterbury in &quot;The Office&quot; (2001–2003), a role which, he said in 2004, &quot;cast a very long shadow&quot; for him as an actor. He appeared in the sitcom &quot;Hardware&quot; (2003–2004). He also appeared in several films, including &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot; (2002) and &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003).

He began to move into more serious dramatic roles on television with his appearance as Lord Shaftesbury in the 2003 BBC historical drama &quot;Charles II: The Power and The Passion&quot;. He made a brief appearance in the first episode of the second series of &quot;This Life&quot;. He starred in the BBC television series &quot;The Robinsons,&quot; and had a cameo in Episode 1 of &quot;Black Books&quot;. In 2007, he appeared in &quot;The All Together&quot; written and directed by Gavin Claxton, and in the Bill Kenwright theatre production of &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;.

He played Dr. John Watson in &quot;Sherlock&quot;, the BBC contemporary adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes detective stories. Its first episode, &quot;A Study in Pink&quot;, was broadcast on 25 July 2010 to critical acclaim. For the role, Freeman won the 2011 BAFTA award for Best Supporting Actor and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.

Freeman played lead character Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson&#x27;s three-part &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series. For his performance in the first part, &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;, Freeman won Best Hero at the 2013 MTV Movie Awards and Best Actor at the 18th Empire Awards.
Freeman appeared in all three films of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright&#x27;s comedic &quot;Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy&quot;, commencing with a brief non-speaking role in &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; as Yvonne&#x27;s boyfriend, Declan, followed by a brief cameo in &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; as a police officer. He was a main cast member in the 2013 finale to the trilogy, &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot;.

He opened in the title role in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot; in July 2014 at Trafalgar Studios.

In 2015, Freeman starred as producer Milton Fruchtman in the television film &quot;The Eichmann Show&quot;, based on blacklisted TV director Leo Hurwitz&#x27;s filming of the 1961 trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann. It intercut dramatic scenes with historical footage from the trial. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described it as &quot;absolutely enthralling&quot;. Freeman also played Everett K. Ross, a Central Intelligence Agency agent in &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, which was released in May 2016.

In 2017, Freeman starred in &quot;Cargo&quot;, a feature-length remake of a 2013 short film of the same name, which premiered at the Adelaide Film Festival on 6 August 2017. Later that year he appeared opposite Tamsin Greig in &quot;Labour of Love&quot;, a political comedy by James Graham, at the Noël Coward Theatre. Freeman portrayed fictional Labour MP David Lyons, whose modernising ideas pit him against the traditional left-wing constituency agent Jean Whittaker (Greig).

<text>The Complex is the second studio album by Blue Man Group, released in 2003. It is a concept album that takes place in two separate worlds: the world of the rock concert, as in the song &quot;Time to Start,&quot; and the alienating world of the modern urban workplace, as in the songs &quot;Sing Along,&quot; &quot;The Current&quot;, and &quot;The Complex.&quot; Both worlds are then tied together in the song &quot;What Is Rock,&quot; which contrasts the celebratory &quot;loss of identity&quot; within a rock performance with the dehumanizing &quot;loss of identity&quot; within the workplace. These themes were illustrated during performance by animations that told the story of a faceless worker eventually escaping &quot;up to the roof&quot; and discovering their true self.

&quot;The Complex&quot; produced three singles, and debuted at #60 on the Billboard charts. As with the previous album, a DVD-Audio version was released, containing a high-definition (96 kHz/24-bit) 5.1 surround sound mix. AllMusic reviewer Robert L. Doerschuk states &quot;Although its inspirations, musical and conceptual, trace as far back as Kraftwerk, &quot;The Complex&quot; serves as a reminder that modern devices and glistening production values can be applied to the most primal creative instincts, if utilized by the right — blue — hands&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Gudgeon&quot; (SS/AGSS/SSAG-567), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the gudgeon, a species of small fresh-water minnow.

==Construction and commissioning ==

The submarine&#x27;s keel was laid by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. It was launched on 11 June 1952 sponsored by Mrs. Robert A. Bonin, widow of the first &quot;Gudgeon&quot;&#x27;s last commanding officer, and commissioned on 21 November 1952 with Commander Robert M. Carroll in command. Gudgeon was the first American submarine to circumnavigate the globe; the navigator aboard this history making voyage was Lt. Leon Leroy Stine Jr., who died on January 30, 2018.

==Service record==

After builders&#x27; trials, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; sailed for Pearl Harbor, where it joined Submarine Squadron 1 (SubRon 1), Submarine Division 1 (SubDiv 1), 18 July 1953. Local operations and training exercises continued until 11 April 1954, when &quot;Gudgeon&quot; sailed to the mainland for antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises along the Washington coast. A Mare Island Naval Shipyard overhaul occupied the remainder of the year, and &quot;Gudgeon&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor 9 March 1955. She sailed 21 Jul 1955, for the first of five WestPac tours, visiting Yokosuka, Formosa, Hong Kong, Manila, and Guam before returning to Pearl Harbor on 30 January 1956. Local operations out of the Hawaiian port, overhaul, special secret operations, and a second voyage to the West Coast took &quot;Gudgeon&quot; through the next 18 months.

Sailing from Pearl Harbor on 8 July 1957, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; began a history-making cruise around the world, making the Pacific Fleet Submarine Force&#x27;s flagship the first American submarine to circumnavigate the globe. After exercises at Yokosuka, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; sailed west 26 August 1957. As it made her way around the world for the next six months, the submarine docked at Asian, African and European ports before a triumphal entry into Pearl Harbor 21 February 1958, eight months and 25,000 miles (40,000 km) since taking departure.

During August 1957, after being detected by the Soviet Navy outside the port of Vladivostok, outside the 3-mile territorial waters limit recognized by the US but well inside the 12-mile limit claimed by the Soviets, the &quot;Gudgeon&quot; was the first US submarine forced to the surface during the Cold War.

==First conversion==
After extensive overhaul, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; again settled into the peacetime local and special operations, training exercises, and ASW activities. Three WestPac cruises, in 1959, 1961, and 1963, took it to Japan for exercises with the Seventh Fleet as well as to the US naval base at Subic Bay in the
Philippine Islands and Hong Kong for liberty. During the alternate years, 1960 and 1962, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; was reassigned to mainland waters, training and exercising along the Washington and California coasts.

==Second conversion==
&quot;Gudgeon&quot; returned from the Far East to Pearl Harbor 1 August 1963, and for the next two years operated in Hawaiian waters. It departed Pearl Harbor 29 November and arrived San Francisco, California, on 9 December for overhaul at Mare Island. The ship was cut in half and an 18-foot (5 meter) section was added during a conversion which gave the submarine new and larger engines as well as the Passive Underwater Fire Control Feasibility System (PUFFS) passive sonar installation. Modernization was completed during April 1967 and &quot;Gudgeon&quot; returned to duty in the Pacific Fleet.

:&quot;[1967-1983]&quot;

&quot;Gudgeon&quot; was reclassified a miscellaneous auxiliary submarine, AGSS-567 and later SSAG-567 during November 1979.

&quot;Gudgeon&quot; served in the Pacific until it was decommissioned on 30 September 1983 and eliminated from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 August 1987.

==Awards==

* China Service Medal
* National Defense Service Medal with star (2 awards)
* Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal
* Vietnam Service Medal with two campaign stars for Vietnam War service

== TCG &quot;Hızırreis&quot; (S 342) ==

During 1983, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; was transferred by lease to Turkey and renamed TCG &quot;Hızırreis&quot; (S 342), named for Ottoman Admiral Kurtoğlu Hızır Reis. It was purchased in 1987, served until 2004, and is presently berthed as a museum ship at the Kocaeli Museum Ships Command in Izmit and is open to the public.

<doc id="483504" wikidata="Q6605152" url="?curid=483504" title="List of aircraft of the Royal Canadian Navy">
<text>This is a list of aircraft of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] covering the period until 1968 when all aircraft operations were transferred to the newly unified Canadian Armed Forces, originally with Maritime Command and since 1975 with Air Command, which has subsequently been renamed as the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF).

Prior to World War II (WWII) the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) did not operate aircraft. During World War I, the Royal Navy Canadian Air Service, a component of the Royal Naval Air Service, used seaplanes to carry out anti-submarine patrols off the Canadian East Coast. After the United States entered the war, the United States Navy established two seaplane bases in Nova Scotia for similar patrols, and the Royal Canadian Naval Air Service (RCNAS) was formed to assume responsibility for these flights; however, the war ended before the RCNAS was ready to operate independently, so it was disbanded and the two bases were deactivated and handed over to the Air Board.

During WWII, Canadian personnel manned the carriers (from 1943 until torpedoed in 1944) and (from 1944 until returned to the US in 1946), with their complement of Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm (FAA) carrier based aircraft. Canadian naval aviators including pilots of the RCN Volunteer Reserve also served in the FAA aboard carriers of the Royal Navy Pacific Fleet. 

With the loan of in 1946, the RCN received its first aircraft, operating Fairey Firefly fighter-bombers and Supermarine Seafire fighters loaned from the Royal Navy. When both aircraft and the ship failed to meet Canadian requirements, was purchased in 1948, along with Hawker Sea Fury fighters and in 1950, Grumman Avenger torpedo bombers.

From then until 1968, the RCN operated a variety of fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. After the Canadian Forces sold off in 1970, Canadian naval vessels operated only Sea King helicopters. The Trackers were transferred to land bases to perform coastal patrols, while the Sikorsky HO4S plane-guard helicopters were retired, and other types still in service were allocated as per their RCAF equivalents.

Aircraft that remained in service after unification are highlighted in blue.

<doc id="483507" wikidata="Q3366171" url="?curid=483507" title="Parti acadien">
<text>The Parti Acadien was a political party in New Brunswick, Canada in the 1970s and 1980s. The party was founded in 1972 by Acadians who were upset over poorer living conditions in predominantly francophone areas of the province versus those areas dominated by anglophones. The economy of New Brunswick was concentrated in the cities of Fredericton, Saint John and Moncton, while the eastern and northern parts of New Brunswick, predominantly Francophone, was relatively poorer as a result of an economy based primarily on entrenched and seasonal commercial fishing and lumber industries.
Despite efforts by Louis Robichaud, an Acadian who served as the province&#x27;s premier between the 1960 and 1970 elections, to modernize through investment in education and business promotion by instituting what was called an equal opportunity program, some Acadians felt they would be better served by their own administration. As a result, the Parti Acadien advocated the formation of a separate Acadian province within Canada, a proposition that would require an amendment to the Canadian Constitution following a provincial referendum.

The Parti Acadien tried to distance itself from its more radical elements, even hesitating to use the word &quot;nationalist&quot;. Their platform had several socialist policies, though officially their goal was to work for reforms using the already-existing framework of New Brunswick law. They also explained that they were not anti-anglophone &quot;per se&quot;, but felt that the capitalist system in place in the province favoured the predominantly English south. Many of the radicals joined a new cultural organization, the Société Acadienne du Nouveau-Brunswick (SANB).
Euclide Chiasson was the party&#x27;s first president and leader. The party nominated 13 candidates in the province&#x27;s 58 ridings in the 1974 provincial election, 23 candidates in the 1978 provincial election, and 10 candidates in the 1982 provincial election, which was the party&#x27;s last.

The party considered an alliance or merger with the New Brunswick New Democratic Party (NDP), encouraging voters in ridings with no Parti Acadien candidate to vote for the NDP instead. No formal agreement was ever reached.

In 1975, Jean-Pierre Lanteigne was elected leader. He sought to abandon demands for a new Acadian province, instead maintaining a social democratic agenda for New Brunswick as a whole. This caused a rift in the party, with some members hoping that the success of the sovereigntist Parti Québécois in the Province of Quebec would spark hopes for Acadian nationalism as well. Lanteigne insisted, however, that his party was not a New Brunswick branch of the Parti Québécois.

==1978 provincial election==
The Parti Acadien decided once again to support the creation of a separate province, in tandem with most (but not all) SANB members. The party went into the 1978 election with a platform of independence. However, Richard Hatfield and the governing Progressive Conservatives also promoted a platform that promised to increase the role of the Acadian people and culture within the province.

The party&#x27;s platform was seen as vague during the election, so it subsequently clarified its positions. The party stood for in decentralization of provincial powers and French-language administrative units across the province. A convention of Parti Acadien supporters, SANB members and other Acadians in 1979 produced a split on the issue of whether to vote to secede from New Brunswick or work for reform from within. The SANB (still a cultural association at the core) risked having its funding from the Government of Canada cut off before it explained that the convention produced no consensus and was not binding.

The 1978 election was the Parti Acadien&#x27;s most successful. Their candidates averaged 12% of the vote, and Restigouche West candidate Armand Plourde finished second, only 170 votes short of first place. This was the party&#x27;s only second-place finish, and the closest it came to winning a seat. In the election the Liberal Party led by Acadian Joseph Daigle garnered 44.36% of the popular vote, just .03% less than the winning Progressive Conservatives and captured twenty-eight seats to the Conservative Party&#x27;s thirty. The votes that went to the Parti Acadien traditionally had gone to the Liberals and it was widely believed that the Parti acadien cost the Liberals the election.

In 1980, the majority of the SANB membership votes in favour of promoting secession. As a result, it lost funding from both the federal and provincial governments, who feared that radicals had taken over the group (and by extension, the Parti Acadien). The more centrist factions of the party jumped ship, mostly to the Conservatives. 

By the 1982 election, the Conservatives&#x27; policies on francophone rights resonated with Acadian voters, and Hatfield&#x27;s party won an unprecedented number of Acadian seats. Hatfield&#x27;s overtures to the Acadians did not sit well with many anglophone New Brunswickers; they later founded the New Brunswick Confederation of Regions Party, whose platform called for English as the only official language in New Brunswick. The Parti Acadien lost 75% of its support from 1978, and officially disbanded in 1986.

<doc id="483516" wikidata="Q320805" url="?curid=483516" title="Al Neuharth">
<text>Allen Harold &quot;Al&quot; Neuharth (March 22, 1924 – April 19, 2013) was an American businessman, author, and columnist born in Eureka, South Dakota. He was the founder of &quot;USA Today&quot;, The Freedom Forum, and its Newseum.

==Early life==
Al Neuharth was born in Eureka, South Dakota, to a German-speaking family. Neuharth&#x27;s parents were Daniel J. and Christina, who married on January 11, 1922. Daniel died when Al was two. Al needed to help his family survive the Great Depression. He worked on his grandfather&#x27;s farm. As a youngster; he also delivered the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; but he gave that up for a better-paying job in the meat industry, sweeping up in the meat plants and slaughtering animals. Neuharth graduated from Alpena High School in Alpena, South Dakota, where he worked for Allen Brigham, owner of the local newspaper, the &quot;Alpena Journal&quot;. At the age of 19, Neuharth served in the Army during World War II. As a member of the 86th Infantry Division, Neuharth was deployed to France, Germany, and the Philippines.

==Education==
After the war, Neuharth attended the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, where he edited the school newspaper, &quot;The Volante&quot;. He maintained an affiliation with the university and had an office in the Media &amp; Journalism building, the Al Neuharth Media Center, until he died in 2013. Neuharth founded the Al Neuharth Free Spirit Scholarship, awarded to graduating high school students who exemplify the qualities of a &quot;free spirit&quot; and aim to pursue a career in journalism.

==News career==
Neuharth and fellow USD alum Bill Porter founded &quot;SoDak Sports&quot;, a weekly newspaper devoted to covering the sports scene in South Dakota. Despite its initial popularity, the weekly &quot;SoDak Sports&quot; went bankrupt in a year&#x27;s time, losing Neuharth the $50,000 he had borrowed.

After his failure, Neuharth went to the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, where he became assistant managing editor. In 1960, the Knight newspaper chain (later a part of Knight Ridder), which owned the &quot;Herald&quot;, sent him to its &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, which was fighting an uphill battle with the &quot;Detroit News&quot;, which Neuharth would later buy while at Gannett.

After Neuharth decided that he could go no further in the Knight organization due to the Knight family&#x27;s control, in 1963, he accepted Gannett head Paul Miller&#x27;s offer to move to Gannett&#x27;s headquarters in Rochester, New York to run its paper there, the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot;. In 1966, he took charge of Gannett Florida. He started &quot;Today&quot; in Cocoa, Florida, which eventually became &quot;Florida Today&quot;. The color schemes used in &quot;Florida Today&quot; became an inspiration for the initial format for &quot;USA Today&quot;. He then ran the boardroom under Miller, whom he eventually succeeded in 1973. He helped to build Gannett into the largest newspaper company in the United States. During his tenure, Gannett&#x27;s revenues expanded by 1,450%. In 1979, Gannett owned 78 daily and 21 weekly newspapers, seven television stations, over a dozen radio stations, outdoor advertising plants, and the Louis Harris &amp; Associates research firm. Gannett purchased Harris because the firm was doing costly research for Neuharth to determine the advisability of starting a new national newspaper.

==&quot;USA Today&quot;==
Neuharth founded &quot;USA Today&quot; in 1982, which as of March 2013 was the third most widely read newspaper in the country. He won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism in 1988, in recognition of his founding of the newspaper. Neuharth retired from Gannett on March 31, 1989, at the age of 65.

After his retirement, Neuharth authored a weekly column entitled &quot;Plain Talk&quot; through August 2010.

==Freedom Forum==
Neuharth served as chairman of the board of the Gannett Foundation upon his retirement. The foundation was founded by Frank Gannett, founder of the newspaper chain. Neuharth took control of the foundation, removed the CEO, and installed his own top executive. He then renamed the foundation the Freedom Forum. Neuharth was chairman of the Freedom Forum from 1991 until he died in 2013.

The Freedom Forum annually gives out the Al Neuharth Award for Excellence in the Media. Past winners include Walter Cronkite (1989), Carl T. Rowan (1990), Helen Thomas (1991), Tom Brokaw (1992), Larry King (1993), Charles Kuralt of CBS (1994), Albert R. Hunt and Judy Woodruff (1995), Robert MacNeil (1996), Cokie Roberts (1997), Tim Russert and Louis Boccardi (1998), John Seigenthaler (1999), Jim Lehrer (2001), Tom Curley (2002), Don Hewitt of CBS (2004), Garrison Keillor (2005), Bob Schieffer of CBS (2006), John Quinn and Ken Paulson (2007), Charles Overby (2008), Katie Couric (2009), Brian Lamb of C-SPAN (2011) and Marilyn Hagerty of the Grand Forks Herald (2012).

==Quotes==
&quot;We in the media could help [the insurance situation] if we put in proper perspective long range hurricane forecasts that often are exaggerated and play into insurers&#x27; hands.&quot;

&quot;The First Amendment guarantees a free press. We in the media must make sure it is a fair press.&quot;

==Personal==
Neuharth had two children from his first marriage on June 16, 1946, to Loretta F. Helgeland. He was divorced in 1973. He married his second wife, Florida State Senator Lori Wilson, in 1973. Their marriage lasted seven years. He married Rachel Fornes, a Cocoa Beach, Florida, chiropractor, and they adopted six children.

In 1975, Neuharth built a beachfront mansion in Cocoa Beach. It contained of living space, 11 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms. It was valued at several million dollars and was the largest in the city. It was sold after his death and was destroyed by fire in 2016.

Neuharth died on Friday, April 19, 2013, at his home in Cocoa Beach, at the age of 89. Jack Marsh, president of the Al Neuharth Media Center and a close friend, confirmed that he died at his home. Marsh said that Neuharth fell earlier in the week and never quite recovered.

<doc id="483526" wikidata="Q1460595" url="?curid=483526" title="Geodesic curvature">
<text>In Riemannian geometry, the geodesic curvature formula_1 of a curve formula_2 measures how far the curve is from being a geodesic. For example, for 1D curves on a 2D surface embedded in 3D space, it is the curvature of the curve projected onto the surface&#x27;s tangent plane. More generally, in a given manifold formula_3, the geodesic curvature is just the usual curvature of formula_2 (see below). However, when the curve formula_2 is restricted to lie on a submanifold formula_6 of formula_3 (e.g. for curves on surfaces), geodesic curvature refers to the curvature of formula_2 in formula_6 and it is different in general from the curvature of formula_2 in the ambient manifold formula_3. The (ambient) curvature formula_12 of formula_2 depends on two factors: the curvature of the submanifold formula_6 in the direction of formula_2 (the normal curvature formula_16), which depends only on the direction of the curve, and the curvature of formula_2 seen in formula_6 (the geodesic curvature formula_1), which is a second order quantity. The relation between these is formula_20. In particular geodesics on formula_6 have zero geodesic curvature (they are &quot;straight&quot;), so that formula_22, which explains why they appear to be curved in ambient space whenever the submanifold is.

==Definition==
Consider a curve formula_2 in a manifold formula_3, parametrized by arclength, with unit tangent vector formula_25. Its curvature is the norm of the covariant derivative of formula_26: formula_27. If formula_2 lies on formula_6, the geodesic curvature is the norm of the projection of the covariant derivative formula_30 on the tangent space to the submanifold. Conversely the normal curvature is the norm of the projection of formula_30 on the normal bundle to the submanifold at the point considered.

If the ambient manifold is the euclidean space formula_32, then the covariant derivative formula_30 is just the usual derivative formula_34.

If formula_2 is unit-speed, i.e. formula_36, and formula_37 designates the unit normal field of formula_6 along formula_2, the geodesic curvature is given by
:formula_40
where the square brackets denote the scalar triple product.

==Example==
Let formula_6 be the unit sphere formula_42 in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The normal curvature of formula_42 is identically 1, independently of the direction considered. Great circles have curvature formula_44, so they have zero geodesic curvature, and are therefore geodesics. Smaller circles of radius formula_45 will have curvature formula_46 and geodesic curvature formula_47.

==Some results involving geodesic curvature==

*The geodesic curvature is none other than the usual curvature of the curve when computed intrinsically in the submanifold formula_6. It does not depend on the way the submanifold formula_6 sits in formula_3.
* Geodesics of formula_6 have zero geodesic curvature, which is equivalent to saying that formula_30 is orthogonal to the tangent space to formula_6.
*On the other hand the normal curvature depends strongly on how the submanifold lies in the ambient space, but marginally on the curve: formula_16 only depends on the point on the submanifold and the direction formula_26, but not on formula_30.
*In general Riemannian geometry, the derivative is computed using the Levi-Civita connection formula_57 of the ambient manifold: formula_58. It splits into a tangent part and a normal part to the submanifold: formula_59. The tangent part is the usual derivative formula_60 in formula_6 (it is a particular case of Gauss equation in the Gauss-Codazzi equations), while the normal part is formula_62, where formula_63 denotes the second fundamental form.

<text>HMS &quot;Quilliam&quot; (G09) was a Q-class destroyer serving in the Royal Navy from 1942 to 1945. She was then transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy, where she was commissioned as HNLMS &quot;Banckert&quot; (D801) from until 1957.

==Construction==
The ship was laid down by R. and W. Hawthorn, Leslie and Company, Limited, at Hebburn-on-Tyne on 19 August 1940, launched on 29 November 1941 and commissioned on 22 October 1942.

She was named after Manx Lieutenant (later Captain) John Quilliam RN, First Lieutenant of at the Battle of Trafalgar.

==Operational history==

===Royal Navy===
&quot;Quilliam&quot; was involved in wartime operations in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

On 20 May 1945, while taking part in Operation Iceberg (the Invasion of Okinawa), &quot;Quilliam&quot; was involved in a collision with the British aircraft carrier , which left the destroyer with a heavily damaged bow. She was out of service for repairs when World War II ended.

===Royal Netherlands Navy===
&quot;Quilliam&quot; was one of six Q-class destroyers to survive World War II. While five were transferred to the Royal Australian Navy, &quot;Quilliam&quot; was instead transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy on 21 November 1945. The ship was renamed HNLMS &quot;Banckert&quot;, and received the pennant number D801. The ship was refitted to Dutch standards and had a new bow fitted before she entered service in the Netherlands East Indies.

&quot;Banckert&quot; saw action during the Indonesian National Revolution. Between 10 and 12 May 1947, the ship intercepted the British coastal merchant ship &quot;NR. 4 Nanmei&quot;, which was supplying contraband to Indonesians in Tapanoeli Bay, and fired on Indonesian coastal defences in Sibolga. She was involved in the Dutch occupation of Tegal on 26 July by providing a landing party. After carrying out patrols during the Dutch &#x27;police counteractions&#x27;, &quot;Banckert&quot; returned to the Netherlands in August 1948 for a refit, which lasted until 19 September 1949. The destroyer arrived at the Soerabaja naval base on 25 December 1949, and was stationed there until 9 December 1950, when she was assigned to Netherlands New Guinea. &quot;Banckert&quot; left Southeast Asia for the Netherlands on 20 August 1951.

On her return, &quot;Banckert&quot; was assigned to the naval base at Den Helder as part of the RNLN&#x27;s European Training Squadron.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Banckert&quot; was paid off in April 1952. She was struck from records on 19 October 1956, and was sold to Jos de Smedt of Antwerp for scrapping on 1 February 1957.

<text>Pichincha is a stratovolcano in Ecuador. The capital Quito wraps around its eastern slopes.

The two highest peaks of the mountain are Wawa Pichincha (Kichwa &quot;wawa&quot; child, baby / small, Spanish spelling &quot;Guagua Pichincha&quot;) () and Ruku Pichincha (Kichwa &quot;ruku&quot; old person, Spanish &quot;Rucu Pichincha&quot;) (). The active caldera is in Wawa Pichincha on the western side of the mountain.

==Description==
Both peaks are visible from the city of Quito and both are popular acclimatization climbs. Wawa Pichincha is usually accessed from the village of Lloa outside of Quito. Ruku is typically accessed from the TelefériQo on the western side of Quito.

In October 1999, the volcano erupted and covered the city with several inches of ash. Before that, the last major eruptions were in 1553 and in 1660, when about of ash fell on the city.

The province in which it is located was named for the mountain. This is also the case for many of the other provinces in Ecuador (including Cotopaxi, Chimborazo, and Imbabura).

==Geography and geology==
&quot;Dracula vampira&quot;, a type of orchid, can be found on the volcano, at an altitude of between above sea level.

==Eruptions==
In 1660, Pichincha underwent a Plinian eruption, spreading ash over , with over of ash falling on Quito.

The most recent significant eruption began in August 1998. On March 12, 2000, a phreatic eruption killed two volcanologists who were working on the lava dome.

==History==
The volcano was considered sacred to numerous cultures of the indigenous peoples who lived in this region for thousands of years before encounter with Spanish and other Europeans.

The first recorded ascent of Guagua Pichincha was in 1582 by a group of locals led by José Ortiguera.

In 1737 several members of the French Geodesic Mission to the equator, including Charles-Marie de La Condamine, Pierre Bouguer and Antonio de Ulloa, spent 23 days on the summit of Rucu Pichincha as part of their triangulation work to calculate the length of a degree of latitude.

On 17 June 1742, during the same mission, La Condamine and Bouguer made an ascent of Guagua Pichincha and looked down into the crater of the volcano, which had last erupted in 1660. La Condamine compared what he saw to the underworld.

In the summer season of 1802, Alexander von Humboldt climbed and measured the altitude of this mountain and several other volcanoes in the region. Humboldt&#x27;s writings inspired artist Frederic Edwin Church to visit and paint Pichincha and other Andean peaks.

On May 24, 1822, General Sucre&#x27;s southern campaign in the Spanish–American War of independence came to a climax when his forces defeated the Spanish colonial army on the southeast slopes of this volcano. The engagement, known as the Battle of Pichincha, secured the independence from Spain of the territories of present-day Ecuador.

<text>Christmas Eve on Sesame Street is a &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Christmas special first broadcast on PBS on Sunday, December 3, 1978.

==Plot==
The special starts with live-action versions of the Muppets enjoying an ice skating party. Afterward, they head home to Sesame Street performing the song &quot;True Blue Miracle&quot;.

In the main story, Oscar the Grouch plants the seeds of doubt in Big Bird&#x27;s mind whether Santa Claus can actually get down chimneys to deliver Christmas presents. Big Bird enlists the help of Kermit the Frog and Grover to interview children about how he manages it; their responses vary. Big Bird even attempts a reenactment with Snuffy but it is unsuccessful. He spends the night out in the cold on the brownstone&#x27;s roof, waiting for Santa to appear in person. After the residents of Sesame Street realize that Big Bird has gone missing, Maria confronts Oscar for upsetting Big Bird. Oscar reveals that he was only teasing Big Bird and agrees to help search for him.

Meanwhile, in a variation on the 1905 O. Henry story &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot;, Bert and Ernie want to give each other Christmas presents, but they have no money. Bert trades away his prized paper clip collection to buy a pink soap dish for Ernie&#x27;s Rubber Duckie, but Ernie has bartered it to get Bert an empty cigar box for his paper clip collection. Mr. Hooper, the store owner, realizes what is happening and gives them their treasured possessions back as Christmas presents.

Also, Cookie Monster attempts to get in touch with Santa Claus to bring him cookies for Christmas. In confusion, he ends up violently eating a pencil, a typewriter to type a letter, and a telephone to call the North Pole. At Gordon and Susan Robinson&#x27;s apartment, he laments to Gordon that he was unable to contact Santa. Gordon suggests leaving cookies for Santa, leaving him perplexed.

In the end, Big Bird walks down from the roof to warm up, much to the relief of his friends. He realizes Santa had already come and gone when he sees the presents under the tree (due to him falling asleep on the roof and Santa&#x27;s shadow looms over him while he&#x27;s asleep). He regrets not learning how Santa can go down chimneys, but he comes to recognize that being together with family and friends is more important. Oscar, true to form, starts needling him about how the Easter Bunny can hide all the eggs in one night, only to be rebuked by Gordon and Susan as Big Bird begins to fret about the holidays all over again.

The special concludes with Susan and Gordon returning to their apartment to find that Cookie Monster has eaten the needles and decorations off their Christmas tree.

*&quot;True Blue Miracle&quot;, sung during the gang&#x27;s trip from the ice rink back to Sesame Street.

*&quot;Keep Christmas with You (All Through the Year)&quot; (Reprise), sung by everyone at the end.

==Awards==
*1979: Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program&quot; - Jon Stone (executive producer), Dulcy Singer (producer)

One of the special&#x27;s competitors that year was a lesser-known, critically panned &quot;Sesame Street&quot; special on CBS -- &quot;A Special Sesame Street Christmas&quot;.

In 1988, the production was converted to a live show and performed on ice for a single show in Philadelphia, PA.

==Edits==
In various re-airings on PBS in the late 1980s the closing scene with Susan and Gordon finding that Cookie Monster ate the needles and discovered off their Christmas tree was cut, likely due to a combination of the PBS closing credits at the end of the original and for Cookie Monster&#x27;s excessive belching.

On video releases since the mid-1990s, the 1978 Children&#x27;s Television Workshop logo with Christmas music was cut. The 1996 VHS replaces it with the 1983 logo, and DVD releases of the special start without any logos.

In December 2020, the special was released on the HBO Max streaming service. Approximately 2 minutes of Big Bird skating to Jose Feliciano’s recording of &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot; was removed. The closing scene featuring Cookie Monster, Susan, and Gordon is present on Max as of December 2023.

When Big Bird and Patty check on Oscar following his skating accident, his original line was &quot;Sure. I&#x27;ve been thrown out of better places than that.&quot; It was later re-dubbed in post-production (to &quot;Let&#x27;s go back and do it, again!&quot;), because Jon Stone considered the original joke too adult-focused.

==Home media==
The special was released on VHS in 1987 and 1996, and on DVD in 2002 and 2008. As of 2023 the show is also available for streaming on Amazon Prime.

==Recording==
The soundtrack album features several of the songs from the special, along with narration. It was nominated for a Grammy Award, but lost to &quot;In Harmony: A Sesame Street Record&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Quentin&quot; was a Q-class destroyer laid down by J. Samuel White and Company, Limited, at Cowes on the Isle of Wight on 25 September 1940, launched on 5 November 1941 and commissioned on 15 April 1942. She saw service during the Second World War before being sunk in 1942 by German aircraft off North Africa.

==Service history==
&quot;Quentin&quot; attacked and sank the German submarine with the aid of destroyers and in the Caribbean Sea near Trinidad on 3 September 1942. &quot;Quentin&quot; and the Australian destroyer depth charged and sank the Italian submarine &quot;Dessiè&quot; off Algeria on 28 November 1942. &quot;Quentin&quot; was torpedoed by German aircraft and sank off North Africa on 2 December 1942 with the loss of 20 men, only hours after participating in the Battle of Skerki Bank.

<doc id="483539" wikidata="Q4470017" url="?curid=483539" title="Cameron Todd Willingham">
<text>Cameron Todd Willingham (January 9, 1968 – February 17, 2004) was an American man who was convicted and executed for the murder of his three young children by arson at the family home in Corsicana, Texas, on December 23, 1991. Since Willingham&#x27;s 2004 execution, significant controversy has arisen over the legitimacy of the guilty verdict and the interpretation of the evidence that was used to convict him of arson and murder.

Willingham&#x27;s case and the investigative techniques were criticized by a 2004 &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article. The case was discussed again in a 2009 investigative report in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. This coverage suggested that the arson evidence was misinterpreted. According to an August 2009 investigative report by an expert hired by the Texas Forensic Science Commission, the original claims of arson were doubtful. The Corsicana Fire Department disputes the findings, stating that the report overlooked several key points in the record. A 2011 documentary, &quot;&quot;, also explored the case.
The case was complicated by allegations that Texas Governor Rick Perry impeded the investigation by replacing three of the nine Forensic Commission members to change the commission&#x27;s findings; Perry denies the allegations.

==Fire==
On December 23, 1991, a fire destroyed the family home of Cameron Todd Willingham in Corsicana, Texas. Killed in the fire were Willingham&#x27;s three daughters: two-year-old Amber Louise Willingham, and one-year-old twins, Karmen Diane Willingham and Kameron Marie Willingham. Willingham himself escaped the home with only minor burns. Stacy Kuykendall, Willingham&#x27;s then-wife and the mother of his three daughters, was not home at the time of the fire. She was out shopping for Christmas presents at a thrift shop.

Prosecutors charged that Willingham set the fire and killed the children in an attempt to cover up abuse of the children and wife. However, there was no evidence of child abuse. Kuykendall told prosecutors that he had never abused the children. &quot;Our kids were spoiled rotten,&quot; she said, insisting he would never harm their children, but according to Kuykendall, she herself was abused by him.

==Investigation and trial==
===Evidence===
After the fire, the police investigation determined that the fire had been started using some form of a liquid accelerant. This evidence included a finding of char patterns in the floor in the shape of &quot;puddles,&quot; a finding of multiple starting points of the fire, and a finding that the fire had burned &quot;fast and hot,&quot; all considered to indicate a fire that had been ignited with the help of a liquid accelerant. The investigators also found charring under the aluminum front door jamb, which they believed was a further indication of a liquid accelerant and tested positive for such an accelerant in the area of the front door. No clear motive was found, and Willingham&#x27;s wife denied that the couple had been fighting prior to the night of the fire.

===Witnesses===
====Johnny Webb====
In addition to the arson evidence presented at the trial, a jailhouse informant named Johnny Webb testified at that time. His testimony has been criticized as contentious for several reasons. Webb claimed that Willingham confessed that he set the fire to hide an injury or death of one of the girls, which was caused by his wife. But none of the girls were found at the time of death to have physical injuries that were still distinguishable after the effects of the fire. Webb later told David Grann, a reporter for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, that he might have been mistaken. He said he was prescribed many medications at that point while being treated for bipolar disorder.

At Willingham&#x27;s trial, Webb offered an explanation for the individual, distinguishable burns found on Amber&#x27;s forehead and arm. He said that Willingham confessed to burning her twice with a piece of &quot;wadded up&quot; paper in an effort to make it appear as though the children were &quot;playing with fire.&quot;

Prosecutor John Jackson noted that Webb was considered unreliable, but he later supported an early release from prison for Webb. Webb later sent Jackson a &quot;Motion to Recant Testimony&quot;, which declared, &quot;Mr. Willingham is innocent of all charges.&quot; Willingham&#x27;s attorneys were not notified. Webb later recanted his recantation. He later asked, &quot;The statute of limitations has run out on perjury, hasn&#x27;t it?&quot;

Webb and Jackson consistently denied that Webb was offered a sentence reduction in return for his testimony against Willingham. Evidence of such a deal would have eliminated Webb&#x27;s testimony. In February 2014, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the Innocence Project investigators said they had discovered a handwritten note in Webb&#x27;s files indicating that such a deal was in play.

====James Grigson====
During the penalty phase of the trial, a prosecutor said that Willingham&#x27;s tattoo of a skull and serpent fit the profile of a sociopath. Two medical experts confirmed the theory. One of those experts, a psychologist who had not published any research in the field of sociopathic behavior, but only held a master&#x27;s degree in marriage and family issues was asked to interpret Willingham&#x27;s Iron Maiden poster. He said that a picture of a fist punching through a skull signified violence and death. He added that Willingham&#x27;s Led Zeppelin poster of a fallen angel was &quot;many times&quot; an indicator of &quot;cultive-type&quot; activities.

The other medical expert, psychiatrist James Grigson, known by the moniker &quot;Dr. Death&quot; for his repeated testimony as an expert witness in which he recommended the death penalty, said that a man of Willingham&#x27;s criminal history was an &quot;extremely severe sociopath&quot; and was incurable. Grigson had served as an expert witness for the prosecution in murder trials across the state of Texas. Prior to his death, he was expelled by the American Psychiatric Association and the Texas Society of Psychiatric Physicians for unethical conduct. The APA said that Grigson had violated the organization&#x27;s ethics code by

&quot;Arriving at a psychiatric diagnosis without first having examined the individuals in question, and for indicating, while testifying in court as an expert witness, that he could predict with 100 per cent certainty that the individuals would engage in future violent acts.&quot;

The prosecution sought to establish that Willingham&#x27;s conduct at the time of the fire and in the days afterward was suspicious. As the fire took hold, Willingham was driven out through the front door of his house, where he crouched down near the entrance. On seeing neighbor Diane Barbee, Willingham began to shout at her to call 911, shouting &quot;My babies are in there!&quot; At trial, Willingham&#x27;s conduct at the scene was described as oscillating between collected and hysterical, at times screaming for assistance and at other times calmly pushing his car back from the flames that were engulfing his house. Willingham later said that he removed the car out of concern that it could explode and worsen the house fire.

====Witnesses to the event and days after====
Eyewitnesses described Willingham as having &quot;singed hair on his chest, eyelids, and head and had a two-inch burn injury on his right shoulder, but the prosecution highlighted the absence of any evidence of smoke inhalation. His wrists and hands were blackened with smoke. He was eventually transported to the hospital for treatment, in handcuffs.&quot;

According to their sworn statements, both Brandice Barbee and Diane Barbee urged Willingham to return to the house to rescue his children. According to Brandice Barbee, &quot;All I could see was smoke.&quot; According to Brandice, he refused, and moved his car away from the fire before returning to sit on a nearby lawn, &quot;not once attempting to go inside to rescue his children.&quot; Once the fire had reached flashover and the fire department arrived, Willingham became far more agitated, to the point of being restrained by emergency services. In the following days, Willingham returned to the house with some family and friends. Neighbors described this group as having an odd levity, which was seen to turn somber on the arrival of authorities. On returning to the scene of the fire with firefighter Ron Franks, in an effort to recover personal property (which was described as a very usual request at trial), Willingham was visibly dismayed at being unable to find a dart set. At a local bar, where a fundraiser was held for the Willingham family, he placed an order for a replacement set, stating that &quot;money was not a problem now.&quot;

====Motive====
The prosecution claimed that Willingham may have been motivated by a desire to rid himself of unwanted children. The prosecutor claimed the fire that killed the children was the third attempt by Willingham to kill them, and that he had attempted to abort each of his wife&#x27;s two pregnancies by kicking her in order to cause miscarriages.

Journalist David Grann reported that &quot;...there is evidence that Willingham hit his wife, even when she was pregnant, but there were no police reports or medical evidence indicating that Willingham had tried to abort or kill his children.&quot; He wrote, &quot;Willingham&#x27;s wife insisted during the trial and under interrogation that Willingham had not physically abused the children.&quot; The trial testimony by Webb, a jailhouse informant, suggested that Willingham had set the fire in order to cover up an injury or death of one of the children due to his wife&#x27;s actions. The prosecutor also said that Willingham was a serial wife abuser, both physically and emotionally. Jackson said Willingham had abused animals and was a sociopath. However, those not associated with the case paint a different picture of Willingham. His former probation officer, Polly Goodin, said he had never demonstrated bizarre or sociopathic behavior and that &quot;He was probably one of my favorite kids.&quot; Bebe Bridges, a former judge who was often on the &quot;opposite side&quot; of Willingham in the legal system, and who had sent him to jail for stealing, said that she could not imagine him killing his children. &quot;He was polite, and he seemed to care&quot;, she said.

===Trial===
Willingham was charged with murder on January 8, 1992. During his trial in August 1992, he was offered a life term in exchange for a guilty plea, which he turned down, insisting he was innocent.

At trial, the fire investigator Vasquez testified there were three points of origin for the fire, which indicated that the fire was &quot;intentionally set by human hands.&quot; A sample of burned material near the doorway of the house tested positive for mineral spirits, indicating the presence of lighter fluid. Willingham had escaped the fire with bare feet and no burn marks. This was taken as evidence that the accelerant was poured by Willingham as he left the house. Several witnesses testified for the prosecution.

In 2009, John Jackson, the prosecutor at the trial, stated that burns suffered by Willingham were &quot;so superficial as to suggest that the same were self-inflicted in an attempt to divert suspicion from himself.&quot; Grann, however, said fire investigators who reviewed the case told him that &quot;Willingham&#x27;s first-degree and second-degree burns were consistent with being in a fire before the moment of &#x27;flashover&#x27; — that is, when everything in a room suddenly ignites.&quot;

Commenting on the condition of the house, Jackson added, &quot;Any escape or rescue route from the burning house was blocked by a refrigerator, which had been pushed against the back door, requiring any person attempting an escape to run through the conflagration at the front of the house.&quot; There were two refrigerators in the Willingham house. Jimmie Hensley, a police detective, and Douglas Fogg, the assistant fire chief — who both investigated the fire — told Grann that they had never believed that the refrigerator was part of the arson plot. &quot;It didn&#x27;t have [anything] to do with the fire,&quot; Fogg said.

Jackson contradicted Willingham&#x27;s account by claiming blood gas analysis at Navarro Regional Hospital shortly after the fire revealed that Willingham had not inhaled any smoke. Willingham&#x27;s statement and eyewitness accounts had detailed rescue attempts.

Consistent with typical Navarro County death penalty practice, Willingham was offered the opportunity to eliminate himself as a suspect by polygraph examination, which Willingham rejected, according to Jackson. Against the advice of his own counsel, Willingham declined a life sentence in exchange for his guilty plea. He insisted he would not admit to something he had not done, even if it meant sparing his life. During his trial, Willingham did not testify; the defense called only one witness, the Willinghams&#x27; babysitter, who stated that she believed that Willingham could not have killed his children.

==Appeals, incarceration, and execution==

Willingham had the Texas Department of Criminal Justice number 999041. While on death row, Willingham was initially incarcerated in the Ellis Unit, and later in the Polunsky Unit. In 1993, Willingham&#x27;s wife, Stacy Kuykendall, filed for divorce, which was granted.

Willingham&#x27;s case gained attention in December 2004, when Maurice Possley and Steve Mills of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; published on poor investigative tactics. In 2009, an investigative report by Grann drew upon analysis by arson investigation experts and advances in fire science since the 1992 investigation; he suggested that the evidence for arson was unconvincing. He suggested that, had this information been available at the time of trial, it would have provided grounds for Willingham&#x27;s acquittal. The 2011 documentary &quot;&quot; also explored the case.

Willingham maintained his innocence up until his death and spent years trying to appeal his conviction. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied Willingham a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; a month before his execution.

Willingham was executed by lethal injection on February 17, 2004, at the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville. According to Michelle Lyons, an American crime reporter, author and then Public Information Director for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, known for witnessing almost 300 executions in Texas including Willingham&#x27;s own execution, Willingham&#x27;s last words and statement was so vulgar and so directed towards his ex-wife Stacy and the witnesses that the warden of the prison started out the execution to shut him up, with Willingham flicking the middle finger in response shortly before dying. Willingham was pronounced dead at 6:20 p.m., seven minutes after the lethal dose began flowing through his veins. He was 36 years old. After his execution, His body was cremated and his ashes secretly spread on his children&#x27;s graves at Oakwood Cemetery by his parents. Willingham&#x27;s gravestone in Rollins Cemetery is a cenotaph.

===Gerald Hurst===
In 2004, fire investigator Gerald Hurst examined the arson evidence compiled by state deputy fire marshal Manuel Vasquez. Hurst individually discredited each piece of arson evidence, using publicly supported experiments backed by his re-creation of the elements in question, the most notable being the Lime Street fire, which created the unique 3-point burn patterns flashover.

This left only the chemical testing for accelerant. The front porch was the only place where an accelerant was verified by laboratory tests, and a photograph taken of the house before the fire showed that a charcoal grill was there. Hurst speculated that it was likely that water sprayed by firefighters had spread the lighter fluid from the melted container. All twenty of the indications listed by Vasquez of an accelerant being used were rebutted by Hurst, who concluded there was &quot;no evidence of arson&quot; — the same conclusion reached by other fire investigators.

Hurst&#x27;s report was sent to governor Rick Perry&#x27;s office, as well as the Board of Pardons and Paroles along with Willingham&#x27;s appeal for clemency. Neither responded to Willingham&#x27;s appeals. In response to allegations that he allowed the execution of an innocent man, Perry was quoted as stating, &quot;Willingham was a monster. He was a guy who murdered his three children, who tried to beat his wife into an abortion so that he wouldn&#x27;t have those kids. Person after person has stood up and testified to facts of this case that quite frankly you all aren&#x27;t covering.&quot;

But Hurst said, &quot;The whole case was based on the purest form of junk science. There was no item of evidence that indicated arson.&quot; A spokeswoman for Governor Perry said he had weighed the &quot;totality of the issues that led to (Willingham&#x27;s) conviction.&quot; The spokeswoman added he was aware of a &quot;claim of a reinterpretation of (the) arson testimony.&quot;

==Question of guilt==
Since Willingham&#x27;s execution, persistent questions have been raised as to the accuracy of the forensic evidence used in the conviction: specifically, whether it can be proven that an accelerant (such as the lighter fluid mentioned above) was used to start the fatal fire. Hurst reviewed the case documents, including the trial transcriptions and an hour-long videotape of the aftermath of the fire scene. Hurst said in December 2004 that &quot;There&#x27;s nothing to suggest to any reasonable arson investigator that this was an arson fire. It was just a fire.&quot;

In June 2009, the State of Texas ordered a re-examination of the case. In August 2009, eighteen years after the fire and five years after Willingham&#x27;s execution, a report conducted by Dr. Craig Beyler, hired by the Texas Forensic Science Commission to review the case, found that &quot;a finding of arson could not be sustained.&quot; Beyler said key testimony from a fire marshal at Willingham&#x27;s trial was &quot;hardly consistent with a scientific mind-set and is more characteristic of mystics or psychics.&quot;

At the behest of the Texas Forensic Science Commission, the prosecutor, John Jackson, and the City of Corsicana have both released formal responses to the Beyler Report on the investigation of the fire that killed Willingham&#x27;s three children. Both were sharply critical of Beyler. In a 2009 article discussing the reasons why Willingham was found guilty, Jackson recalled witness statements establishing that Willingham was overheard whispering to his deceased older daughter at the funeral home, &quot;You&#x27;re not the one who was supposed to die.&quot; Jackson stated that Willingham&#x27;s comment was an indicator of guilt. In a rebuttal, Grann wrote,
&quot;If the arson investigators had concluded that there was no scientific evidence that a crime had occurred — as the top fire investigators in the country have now determined — Willingham&#x27;s words at the funeral would surely be viewed as a sign that he was tormented by the fact that he had survived without saving his children.&quot;

An August 2009 &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; investigative article concluded, &quot;Over the past five years, the Willingham case has been reviewed by nine of the nation&#x27;s top fire scientists — first for the &quot;Tribune&quot;, then for the Innocence Project, and now for the commission. All concluded that the original investigators relied on outdated theories and folklore to justify the determination of arson. The only other evidence of significance against Willingham was twice-recanted testimony by another inmate, who testified that Willingham had confessed to him. Jailhouse informants are viewed with skepticism in the justice system, so much so that some jurisdictions have restrictions against their use.&quot;

The Texas Forensic Science Commission was scheduled to discuss the report by Beyler at a meeting on October 2, 2009, but two days before the meeting, Texas Governor Rick Perry replaced the chair of the commission (Sam Bassett) and two other members (Alan Levy and Aliece Watts). The new chair, John Bradley, canceled the meeting, sparking accusations that Perry was interfering with the investigation and using it for his own political advantage.

In October 2009, the city of Corsicana released two affidavits that included statements from Ronnie Kuykendall, the former brother-in-law of Willingham, originally made in 2004. According to the affidavits, Willingham&#x27;s ex-wife had told Ronnie that Willingham confessed to her that he had set the fire. On October 25, Stacy Kuykendall told the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; that during a final prison meeting just weeks before he was put to death, Willingham admitted setting the fire in response to Stacy&#x27;s alleged threats of divorce the night before.

Journalists familiar with the case noted that Stacy Kuykendall&#x27;s statement explicitly contradicted previous comments, legal testimony, and numerous published interviews before and after the execution. &quot;It&#x27;s hard for me to make heads or tails of anything she said or didn&#x27;t say&quot;, Willingham&#x27;s prosecutor said. For example, earlier in 2009, Kuykendall supported her 2004 contradiction of her brother&#x27;s affidavit (saying that there had been no confession) and had previously always maintained that things had been amicable between her and Willingham before the fire. In 2010, she declared, &quot;Todd murdered Amber, Karmon, and Kameron. He burnt them. He admitted he burnt them to me, and he was convicted for his crime. That is the closest to justice that my daughters will ever get.&quot;

A four-person panel of the Texas Forensic Science Commission investigating evidence of arson presented in the case acknowledged on July 23, 2010, that state and local arson investigators used &quot;flawed science&quot; in determining that the blaze had been deliberately set. It also found insufficient evidence to prove that state Deputy Fire Marshal Manuel Vasquez and Corsicana Assistant Fire Chief Douglas Fogg were negligent or guilty of misconduct in their arson work.

In 2010, the Innocence Project filed a lawsuit against the State of Texas, seeking a judgment of &quot;official oppression.&quot; Judge Charlie Baird held an inquiry in September 2010 in Austin, but Lowell Thompson, the Navarro County DA, appeared at the hearing with a motion for Baird to recuse himself due to conflict of interest — Baird had once affirmed Willingham&#x27;s conviction while sitting as a Criminal Appeals judge yet had also been recognized by an anti-death penalty group. When the recusal motion was denied, Thompson appealed to the Third Court of Appeals and had the proceedings stayed. (Thompson later received an award from the Texas District and County Attorneys Association for this motion and appeal.)

In 2014, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that new evidence emerged indicating Webb had said in taped interviews that he had lied on the witness stand in exchange for a prosecutor&#x27;s help obtaining a reduced prison term and financial support from a rich rancher. On March 3, 2015, the Texas State Bar filed a disciplinary action, &quot;Commission for Lawyer Discipline v. Jackson&quot;, against Jackson for failing to disclose information on his deal with Webb. According to the complaint, &quot;During a pretrial hearing on July 24, 1992, [Jackson] told the trial court that he had no evidence favorable to Willingham. That statement was false.&quot; A jury later heard and rejected the claim that Jackson had hid evidence, finding in favor of Jackson.

<text>HMS &quot;Quality&quot; (G62/D18) was a Q-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy. Entering service in 1942, the destroyer served in several theatres of World War II. Following the war&#x27;s conclusion, the ship was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), commissioning as HMAS &quot;Quality&quot; (G62/D262) in late 1945. Unlike her sister ships, which were refitted as anti-submarine frigates, &quot;Quality&quot; was not modified, decommissioned after only 59 days of service, and was sold for scrap in 1958.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Quality&quot; was one of eight Q-class destroyers constructed as a flotilla under the War Emergency Programme. These ships had a standard displacement of 1,705 tons, and a deep load displacement of 2,424 tons. They were long overall, and long between perpendiculars, with a beam of . Propulsion was provided by two Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons Impulse turbines, which generated for the propeller shafts. The destroyers had a maximum speed of , and a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 8 officers and 181 sailors.

Main armament consisted of four QF 4.7 inch Mk IX guns in single turrets. This was supplemented by a quadruple 2-pounder pom-pom, and six 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns. Four depth-charge throwers were fitted, with a payload of 70 charges carried, and two quadruple 21-inch torpedo tube sets were fitted, although a maximum of eight torpedoes were carried.

&quot;Quality&quot; was laid down by Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson Limited at their Wallsend-on-Tyne shipyard on 10 October 1940. The destroyer was launched by the wife of the shipyard overseer on 6 October 1941. The destroyer was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 7 September 1942. Although commissioned as a Royal Navy vessel, a large portion of the ship&#x27;s company were on loan from the RAN. Like all ships in the class, &quot;Quality&quot; was given a name starting with &quot;Q&quot;: the ship&#x27;s badge depicts an ingot of gold stamped with the Hallmarks of Quality from the assay offices at London and Edinburgh.

==Operational history==

===World War II===
During World War II, the destroyer operated in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean. The destroyer was transferred to the British Pacific Fleet in 1945.

On 25 July 1944 &quot;Quality&quot; took part in Operation Crimson which was the naval bombardment and aerial strikes on Japanese airfields in the Indonesian cities of Sabang, Lhoknga and Kutaraja. At 0515, &quot;Quality&quot; along with the destroyers , and the Dutch light cruiser entered the harbour at Sabang and subsequently shelled and torpedoed Japanese positions and ships along the coast and quay. &quot;Quality&quot; was hit at 0711 by 3-inch anti-aircraft shell which exploded in the rigging, causing damage to the after-bridge, mast and HA Director. &quot;Quality&quot; suffered eight casualties, one of which proved fatal, a British Movietone news cameraman who was filming on board at the time.

&quot;Quality&quot; was awarded four battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;North Africa 1942–43&quot;, &quot;Sabang 1944&quot;, &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;, and &quot;Japan 1945&quot;.

===Transfer to RAN===
On 8 October 1945, &quot;Quality&quot; became one of five Q-class ships transferred to the RAN on loan. The transfer allowed the return of four N-class destroyers to the RN. &quot;Quality&quot; was transferred on 8 October 1945, and commissioned into the RAN on 28 November. The ship spent most of her short career in Australian waters, apart from visits to Manus Island and New Guinea.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Quality&quot; paid off into reserve on 25 January 1946, 59 days after commissioning. The destroyer was to be converted into an anti-submarine frigate: to facilitate this, &quot;Quality&quot; and her four sister ships were gifted to the RAN in May 1950. &quot;Quality&quot; was designated as the last of the five ships to undergo the conversion. While waiting for conversion, the destroyer underwent refits in 1948 and 1950, and had to be docked for repairs to her hull in 1954. On 14 August 1956, one of the reserve fleet shipkeepers noticed that &quot;Quality&quot; was sitting lower in the water than normal. It was discovered that the hull had become corroded at the waterline, with the ship taking on water. &quot;Quality&quot; underwent an emergency dry docking that day at Garden Island, with the superstructure cut off to increase the ship&#x27;s freeboard.

The deterioration of the ship while waiting for modernisation, combined with post-World War II reductions in RAN personnel numbers, the increases in both time and cost for the other four Q-class conversions, and the need for the RAN to cut back spending in order to support the navy&#x27;s new aircraft carriers, meant that the conversion of &quot;Quality&quot; was cancelled and the ship was marked for disposal. &quot;Quality&quot; was sold for scrap to the Mitsubishi Company of Japan on 10 April 1958 for breaking up as scrap. The ship&#x27;s bell was donated to a school in Nowra, New South Wales.

<doc id="483548" wikidata="Q1863432" url="?curid=483548" title="List of aircraft of Canada's air forces">
<text>This is a list of aircraft of Canada&#x27;s air forces.
Aircraft are listed for the following organizations:
* Canadian Aviation Corps (1914–1915) which operated a single Burgess-Dunne tailless floatplane
* Canadian Air Force (CAF) (1920–1924) while under the control of the Air Board.
* Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) (1924–1968) until amalgamated with the Royal Canadian Navy and Canadian Army to form a unified Canadian Forces.
* Canadian Forces (CAF/CF) (1968–2011) until Canadian Forces Air Command renamed Royal Canadian Air Force again
* Royal Canadian Air Force (2011–current)
This list only includes aircraft owned by the Canadian government, and excludes aircraft flown by Canadian pilots serving with the Royal Flying Corps, Royal Flying Corps Canada or Royal Air Force, including the Article XV squadrons.

From 1917 to November 1918 the British government funded and operated the Royal Flying Corps Canada (later Royal Air Force Canada) which trained aviators on the approximately 1,210 Curtiss Canucks built in Canada, 120 Curtiss JN-4s built in the US, as well as two Avro 504s and one Airco DH.6 built in Canada.

In 1918 the Canadian government formed the &quot;Canadian Air Force&quot; in Europe which consisted of two wings integrated into the normal Royal Air Force command structure, equipped with Sopwith Dolphins, Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5as and Airco DH.9As supplied and owned by the RAF. It was disbanded in 1920.
When the war ended some of these same types were offered to Canada as a part of the Imperial Gift, along with a batch of Fokker D.VIIs captured from Germany, which aside from some illicit flights were relegated primarily to storage and use as instructional airframes.

Independently of the RCAF, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) also operated aircraft; upon unification, CAF/CF assumed operational responsibility for all remaining RCN Canadair CT-133 Silver Star, Grumman CS2F Tracker, Sikorsky HO4S-3, and Sikorsky CHSS-2 Sea King aircraft.

==Designations==
During the First World War no official standards existed for the naming of aircraft and so all designations at this time were assigned by the original manufacturer and both numbers and names were used.
From 1918, aircraft were given names based on a set of rules, and individual variants designated numerically as mark I, mark II, etc. as per RAF practice, including aircraft purchased from American sources. For more information on specifics of the system, see British military aircraft designation systems.
Aircraft purchased from local sources often retained their original commercial names such as with the Barkley-Grow T8P-1 or the Waco AQC-6, particularly if purchased in small numbers, impressed or not purchased from the original manufacturer. 
CF-100 and CF-105 were Avro Canada company designations that preceded similar RCAF designations that became the basis for the Canadian Forces designations instituted in February 1968. Unlike the US designation system, there is only a single sequence rather than separate sequences for each role, and numbering started at 100, prefixed with C (for Canada) and a role letter or letters. According to R. W. Walker. 102 and 103 were not used in the CF system to avoid confusion with Avro&#x27;s use of those numbers for the cancelled Avro Canada C-102 Jetliner and the Avro Canada CF-103 interceptor project.

<doc id="483550" wikidata="Q741017" url="?curid=483550" title="Boquerón, Paraguay">
<text>Boquerón () is a department in the western region of Paraguay. It is the country&#x27;s largest department, with an area of , but, according to the census for 2022 by INE, its population is 71,078, being the second least populated department. The department includes the  Mennonite colonies of Fernheim, Menno and its administrative center Loma Plata and Neuland. The capital is Filadelfia. Other towns are General Eugenio A. Garay, Doctor Pedro P. Peña and Mariscal Estigarribia.

In 1945 Boquerón was split, with the northern portion separated off being renamed &quot;Chaco&quot;. The reduced remaining area continued to be called &quot;Boquerón&quot;, and the department&#x27;s capital was moved to Filadelfia (the previous capital had been Doctor Pedro P. Peña). However, in 1992 the previous department Chaco was re-integrated into Boquerón, effectively re-forming the department as of 1945 when it was split, except that after 1992 the enlarged department&#x27;s capital remained at Filadelfia.

==Geography==
Boquerón Department is located in the Occidental Region of Paraguay, between the southern parallels 20° 06&#x27; and 23° 50&#x27; of latitude, and the western meridians 50° 20&#x27; and 62° 40&#x27; of longitude. It is the largest department of Paraguay, with an area of , slightly larger than Hungary or the province of South Sumatra.

===Adjacent territories===
North: Alto Paraguay Department, separated by an arbitrary straight line that goes from Hito IV Fort Tte. G. Mendoza to Fort Madrejón; and also by a railway from &quot;km 220&quot; to &quot;km 160&quot;.

South: Argentina, separated by the Pilcomayo River, from Misión San Lorenzo to Hito I Esmeralda.

East: Presidente Hayes Department, separated by the road that connects Misión San Lorenzo with Fort Gral. Díaz, Ávalos Sánchez, Zenteno, Dr. Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, Boquerón, Isla Po&#x27;í and Casanillo; and from this point, by an imaginary straight line until &quot;km 160&quot;. It also borders Alto Paraguay Department, separated from it by a straight imaginary line from Fort Madrejón to Fort Carlos Antonio López and from there by another line to Fort Montanía.

West: Bolivia, separated by an imaginary line from Hito I Esmeralda until Hito IV Fort Tte. Gabino Mendoza.

===Natural environment and climate===
This is the most arid region of Paraguay; it has some small streams, but with dry riverbeds. The climate is in the transition between a warm semi-arid climate, a tropical savanna climate and a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;, &quot;Aw&quot; and &quot;Cfa&quot;) The rain is scarce during the dry season, but during the wet season it can cause flash floods. The average annual rainfall is about a year in the north of the department and a year in the south. On 14 November 2009, Pratts Gill, a small town in the Boquerón Department, recorded a temperature of . This is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Paraguay.

The trees in the area are short and thorny; there are brushwood and cactus, dunes and small hills, especially in the north of the department. Some species of trees in this region are endangered: the urunde&#x27;y, white and red quebracho, samu&#x27;u also known as palo borracho and palo santo.

==Demographics==
Boquerón presently has the fastest rate of population growth, about 12.4% annually. This department is characterized by its native population, the Mennonites, the Paraguayans, the Brazilians and other foreign residents in the country.

The National Census in 2002 registered 45,617 people living in Boquerón, mostly Native Americans (19,945, or 43.7%, distributed in the following ethnic groups: Nivaclé, Manjui, Guarayos, Angaité, Ayoreos, Guaraní-Ñandéva, Tapieté and Toba-Maskóy). The majority of Paraguay&#x27;s native population lives in this department.

===Population===
The total Native population of the country is 87,099. The quantity in Chaco is 42,939.
The total Boquerón population is 45,617, 19,945 of which are natives.
Growth of the total population in Boquerón is 4.6% and in the Urban area alone is 12.4%.
*Filadelfia: 7,750
*Loma Plata: 6,500
*Yalve Sanga: 4,200
*Mariscal Estigarribia: 2,000
*Neu-Halbstadt: 720
*Choferes del Chaco: 600

==District and departmental governments==

The department is divided in 4 districts:
# Filadelfia
# Loma Plata
# Mariscal Estigarribia
# Boquerón

Boquerón had only one district since December 18, 1944. In December 2006, Loma Plata and Filadelfia were added, and this last became the new capital of the department by Law 71/92. Boquerón now has 5 members and 45 councilors in the executive government.

In January 2021, a new district was created after enactment by the Paraguayan government: the Boquerón district, which covers the Neuland Colony region, being separated from the Mariscal Estigarribia district. As a result, the department now has 4 districts.

The government of the department administers two high schools, one agricultural school, a hospital and the Hydrological Resources Director (DRH for its initials in Spanish), that belongs to the Agriculture and Cattle Ministry. It has a Health and Education Secretary, a Natural Environment Secretary, a Secretary for Native-American Related Affairs, Public Construction, Women Related Affairs, Childhood and Youth Secretaries.

==Education==
The department has 160 educational institutions with 9,000 students and more than 450 teachers. These numbers include the private institutions and the one that provides professional skills education. Literacy instruction reaches 80%, according to the Census of 2002.

Distance is the main challenge for both students and teachers; it can be difficult to get to the educational institutions, leading people to drop out of school. There are some marginal areas with well-defined curricular norms set by the Occidental Region, but there are not enough teachers for the classes.

The total registered students is 8,932: 6,689 in elementary school and 2,243 in high school in a total of 103 schools. There are 384 registered teachers.

The literate population of 15 years and more is 21,482.

==Health==

This department has 4 private hospitals. The 17th Health Region, assisted by the Ministry of Public Health and Social Wellbeing, has a regional hospital in Mariscal Estigarribia. The government supports the Maternal and Childhood Center in Villa Choferes del Chaco. More than half of the population is in Filadelfia, Loma Plata, Yalve Sanga and Colonia Neuland.

The natives receive health care from the private sector. Some of them have Social Security, but not all. In this department are 23 health centers, which have 8.8 beds per 10,000 inhabitants.

Mennonites have private medical insurance and are well-organized in that sector. The health system is a basic necessity and is the one that needs more attention, considering that 22% of the population in the area lives in poverty.

==Economy==
Cattle ranches and dairy farms generate the greatest share of the income, with the dairy products and meat being exported. There are 4,500 owners of 900,000 cows. The area&#x27;s daily dairy production is about 450,000 to 500,000 liters of milk; this forms 70% of the industry in the Central Chaco.

Leatherworking is a considerable portion of the local economy, with saddles and shoes the main products. In agriculture, the common products are: bananas, lemons, sweet and sour oranges, tangerines, beans, sweet potatoes, onions, pumpkins, corn, peanuts and sorghum.
==Communications==
Boquerón has 120 kilometers of paved roads, but also many that are not paved, which makes travel difficult in the rainy and dry seasons.

Traveling to and within Boquerón can be difficult. Logistical planning is often necessary, including taking drinking water, food, enough fuel, and an emergency kit.

The Mennonites in the area often perform their own road maintenance on approximately 3,800 kilometers of road every year. They also know the region very well.

The Mariscal Estigarribia district has an airport used by all kinds of planes.

In some districts, modern technology such as television, internet and cell phones are available. Nevertheless, there are places where communication is impossible because of the characteristics of the land. In addition most of the Ayoreo natives who still live in the interior have not yet adapted to civilization.

Radio stations serve a fundamental role as a means of communication. La Voz del Chaco Paraguayo AM, broadcasts to the entire Occidental Region, reaching places where communication is usually difficult.

There is another radio station, Radio Médano, which broadcasts in FM.

There are two community radio stations: one in Mariscal Estigarribia and another in Doctor Pedro P. Peña.

==Tourism==
Rural and ecological tourism has become very popular in the Central Chaco, where people can witness the life and process of adaptation of the colonial immigrants. Many tourists and students visit the native villages and colonies that are dedicate to cattle and some other industries; most of them leave very pleased by the experience.

The Boquerón, Toledo and Isla Po&#x27;í forts are very popular; in these places, traces remain of the Chaco War, an important part of Paraguayan history.

==Symbols==
Boquerón has a flag and badge. The musical theme &quot;Chaco Boreal&quot; is the anthem of the department. These symbols were presented in public on September 29, 1995, in Fort Toledo, in the presence of 200 students of the area.

<doc id="483554" wikidata="Q272532" url="?curid=483554" title="Marcelo Ríos">
<text>Marcelo Andrés Ríos Mayorga (; born 26 December 1975) is a Chilean former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the first Latin American to reach the top position. Ríos won 18 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including five Masters events, and was the runner-up at the 1998 Australian Open. He is the only man in the Open Era to have been world No. 1 without ever winning a major singles tournament.

Ríos was the first player to win all three clay court Masters tournaments (Monte Carlo, Rome, and Hamburg) since the format began in 1990. He was also the third man (after Michael Chang and Pete Sampras) to complete the Sunshine Double (winning Indian Wells and Miami Masters in the same year), which he achieved in 1998. At , Ríos is the shortest man to hold the number 1 ranking. He also held the top ranking in juniors.

Ríos retired from the sport in July 2004, due to a long-term back injury. He played his last ATP Tour-level tournament while only 27 years old at the 2003 French Open.

==Tennis career==
Ríos turned professional in 1994 and finished 1997, 1998, and 1999 as a top-ten player. Ríos won a total of 18 top-level singles titles and one top-level doubles title during his career.

===Early years===
Ríos began playing tennis at the age of 11 at the &quot;Sport Francés&quot; golf club in Vitacura (Greater Santiago), adjacent to his house.

===Junior career===
As a junior, Ríos reached as high as No. 1 in singles and No. 141 in doubles.

Ríos reached the semifinals of the junior French Open in 1993 without dropping a set, where he was defeated by Roberto Carretero-Diaz in straight sets, and won the junior US Open in 1993 while only dropping one set during the entire tournament. He also won his first Satellite tournament in Chile.

===1994: Turned Professional===
This was Ríos&#x27; first year as a professional player, and he quickly began to acquire international fame after his participation at Roland Garros, where, at just 18 years of age, he faced Pete Sampras in the second round, fighting a hard battle before eventually losing 6–7, 6–7, 4–6. His left-handed ability, plus his novel long hair and backwards visor, drew the attention of the media. The same year he won his first Challenger in Dresden, Germany.

===1995: Breakthrough===
In May 1995, aged 19, Ríos won his first tournament title in Bologna defeating Marcelo Filippini of Uruguay 6–2, 6–4, and breaking into the world&#x27;s top 50 for the first time. Then in June, he won at Amsterdam in both singles (against Jan Siemerink, 6–4, 7–5, 6–4) and doubles (with Sjeng Schalken) and won the tournament in Kuala Lumpur against Mark Philippoussis 7–6, 6–2. He also reached the final of his home country&#x27;s ATP tournament in Santiago. Ríos ended the year ranked No. 25 in the world.

===1996: Top 10 debut===
His achievements this year included excellent performances in the Masters Series (then called Super 9) tournaments. He reached the quarterfinals in Masters Series of Stuttgart and Rome, and the semifinals in Indian Wells, Monte Carlo, and Canada. In Sankt Pölten, Austria, he won his fourth career title by defeating the Spaniard Félix Mantilla 6–1, 6–4. Ríos again reached the final in Santiago, and also reached the finals in Barcelona and Scottsdale. For much of the year Ríos would be ranked in the top 10, becoming the first Chilean in history to do so. He finished the year ranked number 11.

===1997: Impending dominance===
In 1997 for the first time in Ríos&#x27; career he reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament at the Australian Open and again at the US Open. He also won his first Masters title at Monte Carlo; after a first round bye, he beat Andrea Gaudenzi, Albert Costa, Carlos Moyá, Magnus Larsson, and, in the final, Àlex Corretja, 6–4, 6–3, 6–3. Two weeks later, he lost in the final of the Rome Masters against the same Spaniard. Other successes for the year included the quarterfinals (again) in the Stuttgart Masters and the finals in Marseille, Boston, and (for the third time) in Santiago. Ríos had a very consistent 1997 season, being the only player to reach the fourth round or better on all Grand Slams. Ríos went as high as No. 6 during the year, and ended the year in the top ten for the first time, being No. 10.

===1998: World No. 1 in singles, first Grand Slam final===
The year 1998 brought the peak of his career, when he reached the No. 1 spot in the world. He won the tournament (the first of the year) in Auckland, New Zealand, against Richard Fromberg, then reached the final of the Australian Open, beating Grant Stafford, Thomas Enqvist, Andrew Ilie, Lionel Roux, Alberto Berasategui and Nicolas Escudé before losing to Petr Korda in a lopsided 2–6, 2–6, 2–6 that lasted 1 hour and 25 minutes. The following months brought successes such as the title of the Super 9 (the current Masters Series) at Indian Wells, where he defeated British Greg Rusedski in the final.

The consummation came in the final at Key Biscayne, Florida, under the guidance of his coach Larry Stefanki. After victories over Hendrik Dreekmann, Tommy Haas, and Goran Ivanišević, Ríos beat Thomas Enqvist in the quarterfinals and Tim Henman in the semifinals. In the final on 29 March, Ríos defeated Andre Agassi 7–5, 6–3, 6–4. In Chile, thousands of people took to the streets to celebrate the triumph of the first Chilean, Latin and indeed Spanish speaking player to reach the sport&#x27;s No. 1 ranking, grabbing the position from Pete Sampras (who had maintained 102 consecutive weeks at No. 1, and five years ending the season as the leader). In the days ahead, there was a crowded reception leading Ríos to then president Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle on La Moneda Palace, with around 10,000 people cheering at the palace&#x27;s surroundings. Ríos&#x27; No. 1 ranking lasted four weeks; he lost it after being unable to defend the title at Monte Carlo because of an injury suffered in the Davis Cup while defeating Hernán Gumy in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In May, he reached the quarterfinals of the French Open losing to eventual champion Carlos Moyá.

In June, at Wimbledon, Ríos was upset in the first round by Francisco Clavet. However, on 10 August, Ríos regained the No. 1 spot for another two weeks. In September, he lost at third round of the US Open to Magnus Larsson. During this season, Ríos also won the Rome Masters against Albert Costa, who withdrew from the final, Sankt Pölten by defeating Vincent Spadea, the Grand Slam Cup against Andre Agassi, and Singapore by defeating Mark Woodforde. Furthermore, he reached the quarterfinals of the Stuttgart Masters and Paris Masters. In 1998, Ríos won seven titles, including three Masters Series titles, and reached the final of the Australian Open. On 27 July of that year, he reached the maximum number of points achieved throughout his career: 3719 (according to the scoring system used prior to the year 2000). He ended the year ranked No. 2 behind Pete Sampras, who topped the world rankings for a sixth consecutive year.

===1999: Continued success and beginning of injuries===
Ríos maintained a high level throughout 1999, although his game was interrupted by repeated injuries and surgeries. This prevented him from defending the points achieved by reaching the final of the Australian Open the previous year, so he fell several places in the rankings. He reached the final of the Monte Carlo Masters, but after trailing 4–6, 1–2, he had to retire due to a new injury, handing the tournament to Gustavo Kuerten. Ríos subsequently won the Hamburg Masters in a match that lasted more than four hours against Mariano Zabaleta; two weeks later he became champion in Sankt Pölten for the second consecutive time against the same Argentine, who, this time, had to retire during the first set at 4–4. In October, he won at Singapore and reached the final in Beijing, losing to Magnus Norman. He also reached the quarterfinals at Roland Garros and the Stuttgart Masters. Despite many injuries he suffered and surgeries he underwent, Ríos would complete his third consecutive year as a top-ten player, at world No. 9.

===2000: Persistent injuries===

Since 2000 until the end of Ríos&#x27; career on the main tour, he was not able to keep up his level of play to the standards he set in the previous decade, as it was marked by repeated and disabling injuries. He still won the tournament of Umag, Croatia beating the Argentine Mariano Puerta in the final. He also reached the semifinals at the Hamburg Masters losing to Marat Safin. Ríos finished the year No. 37 in the world.

===2001–2002: Decline===
In 2001, Ríos won the first tournament of the year in Doha. However, his performance in the following tournaments was weaker, weakened by an ankle operation, which resulted in him dropping out of the top 50 in the world for the first time since he was a teenager. In September, Ríos won another title, this time in Hong Kong, defeating Rainer Schüttler in the final. Ríos decided to return in October to play a Challenger event in Santiago in an effort to end his curse of not winning an ATP tournament in his home country. He won the title, beating Edgardo Massa in the final. He also reached a doubles final in Scottsdale. Ríos ended the year as No. 39 in the world.

In early 2002, Ríos had some good results, but a back injury prevented him from continuing the season successfully. It was the same injury that he had already had two operations on, and finally prevented him from returning to a competitive level. His best results were the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, the semifinals at the Miami Masters, and the final in the Stockholm tournament playing the Paradorn Srichaphan. Ríos would finish in the top 25 in the world for the first time since 1999 at No. 24, but without managing to recover from the injuries that beset him since late 1999.

===2003: Long absence from tour and out of top 100===
Ríos reached the final of the Viña del Mar tournament (formerly the Santiago tournament) but lost to Spaniard David Sánchez. This was the fourth final he has reached and lost in his home country but failed to win. However, representing Chile alongside Fernando González and Nicolás Massú, he won the World Team Cup in Düsseldorf. In the same year, he also won silver medals in singles and doubles with Adrián García in the 2003 Pan American Games. In May, Ríos played his last ATP-level match, losing in the first round of Roland Garros to Mario Ančić and retiring at 1–6, 0–1. In 2003, Ríos played in very few tournaments, most of which he had to withdraw from due to injuries. As a result, he ended the year at No. 105 in the world, his worst year-end ranking on the main tour yet.

===2004: Retirement from main tour===
In 2004, six years after claiming the world No. 1 ranking, and after a long absence from the tour, Ríos returned to competition with a victory at a Challenger Series tournament in Ecuador. He played his last competitive match in early April 2004 at a Challenger in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, where he retired in the round of 16.

Finally, on 16 July 2004, after years of constant injuries—and at just 28 years old—Ríos announced his retirement from tennis during a press conference in Santiago. He organized a farewell tour across his home country, travelling through several cities, meeting with fans, offering tennis clinics, and playing friendly matches with international and local tennis players such as Petr Korda and Goran Ivanišević. The tour ended on 22 December 2004, at a soccer stadium in Santiago, where he played his final tennis match of his career on the main tour against Guillermo Coria.

===2015: ITF probe request===
In 2015, it was announced that the Chile Tennis Federation and Ríos himself were to request a probe by the International Tennis Federation into his 1998 Australian Open final opponent Petr Korda&#x27;s possible doping activity during the tournament.

===2018: Desire for a comeback===
Following successful elbow surgery in November 2018, Ríos announced a comeback as part of his desire to become the oldest ever winner of a Challenger tournament, though his plans ultimately did not come to fruition.

On 21 December 2018, Ríos defeated Nicolás Lapentti 6–4, 5–7, [11–9] in an exhibition in Chile.

===ATP Champions Tour===
====2006====
On 29 March 2006, Ríos, aged 30, debuted on the ATP Champions Tour, a tour for former tour players, having met the requirement of at least two years after retirement. At his first tournament on the tour in Doha, Qatar, he defeated Thomas Muster, Henri Leconte, Pat Cash, and Cédric Pioline to claim the title. The following week he repeated, this time winning the crown in Hong Kong, where he won the final against Muster. Ríos won six tournaments in a row, adding Algarve, Graz, Paris and Eindhoven to the above. His inclusion on the senior circuit caused mild controversy, as he was significantly younger than many of his fellow competitors. He ended the year as No. 1, winning a total of six tournaments and holding a winning streak of 25 matches, achieving the record of being the only player in history to be No. 1 in the world as a junior, professional and veteran.

====2007====
Ríos did not take part at the Champions Tour in 2007.

He actually intended to return to the ATP Tour in February at the Viña del Mar tournament (Movistar Open), but he defaulted because of the same back injury that made him retire from the tour.

On 30 March 2007, Ríos played an exhibition match in the Movistar Arena against Andre Agassi, both as a way to commemorate the match where Ríos rose to world No. 1 and as a way of having the American play in Chile.

====2008====
In 2008, Ríos came back to veteran&#x27;s tour where he won the tournaments in Barcelona and Algarve. On 22 June 2008, he was defeated by Pete Sampras in the final of a seniors tournament in São Paulo, Brazil. Ríos ended the year as No. 3 in the veteran&#x27;s world rankings.

On 24 June 2008, Ríos defeated Sampras in an exhibition match that commemorated the 10-year anniversary of having reached the No. 1 ranking in the world.

==Personal life==

Ríos was born in Santiago, Chile to Jorge Ríos Jarvis, an engineer and businessman, and Alicia Mayorga, a teacher. He has an older sister, Paula.

Ríos met the 14-year-old Costa Rican Giuliana Sotela in September 1998 while he was training at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Florida. Ríos and Sotela got married in December 2000 in Santiago. They have a daughter, Constanza, who was born in June 2001. In March 2004, the marriage ended in divorce, which legally took place in Costa Rica, as Chile did not allow married couples the right of divorce until November 2004. During 2004, Ríos worked as a sports commentator for a radio station in Chile.

In April 2005, Ríos married model María Eugenia &quot;Kenita&quot; Larraín, a former fiancée of football player Iván Zamorano. The couple subsequently experienced a very public break-up in September of the same year after an incident in Costa Rica in which Larraín was injured when Ríos allegedly threw her out of his car while he was driving to visit his daughter. Ríos claimed that marrying Larraín was &quot;the biggest mistake of my life.&quot; Ríos had previously been in a relationship with Larraín&#x27;s cousin, Patricia Larraín, from 1995 to 1998.

In May 2008, Ríos married Paula Pavic. They have five children together, daughter Isidora (born December 2008), daughter Colomba (born June 2010), and also triplets, which are a son named Marcelo jr. and two daughters named Antonella and Agustina (all born December 2011). Ríos and Pavic divorced in 2023.

In March 2008, on the tenth anniversary of Ríos reaching the No. 1 ranking, journalist Nelson Flores published a book in Spanish titled &quot;El extraño del pelo largo (The strange man with long hair)&quot;, recounting his experiences following the player from his junior days up to his ascent to the top of the ATP singles ranking.

In May 2014, Ríos said in an interview with &quot;El Mercurio&quot; that he could have Asperger&#x27;s syndrome. On 17 November 2016, he confirmed in an interview with Chilevisión that he was diagnosed with Asperger&#x27;s twice in his life, as a child and during a Davis Cup tie, but he did not care that much until the 2014 interview.

He relocated his family to Sarasota, Florida, in late 2018, according to the website tennis-prose.com.

==Controversies==
Ríos&#x27; career was marked by a number of controversies.
* In 1998, he fired his coach Larry Stefanki shortly after he became world No. 1, claiming that he wanted to go in a different direction.
* After achieving number one in singles, an Argentine reporter asked him what it felt like to be at the same status as Guillermo Vilas; he answered, &quot;I&#x27;ve been compared to Vilas for a while now. I do not know him. All I know is that he was No. 2, and I&#x27;m No. 1.&quot;
* He was fined US$10,000 for speeding during the 1998 Stuttgart Indoor tournament.
* In a confusing incident, he ran over his physical trainer, Manuel Astorga, in his jeep, causing serious foot injuries. Astorga was later fired as trainer.
* After a magazine published some photos of him dancing seductively with a woman at a Paris disco, his girlfriend (later to be his first wife), Giuliana Sotela, broke up with him. During a Davis Cup press conference, Ríos read a letter, asking Sotela for forgiveness. He ended the press conference in tears.
* He was accused by his second wife, María Eugenia Larraín, of throwing her out of his car while driving to visit his daughter in Costa Rica. Larraín arrived at Santiago&#x27;s airport in a dramatic fashion, in a wheelchair, and showing multiple bruises on her legs. He claimed that the bruises were not caused by him but were from a skiing accident.
* He was disqualified from the 2000 Mercedes-Benz Cup tennis tournament in Los Angeles, California during a first-round match with Gouichi Motomura of Japan and fined US$5,000 for saying &quot;fuck you&quot; to the chair umpire.
* He was arrested in Rome in 2001 after he punched a taxi driver on the nose and then had a fight with the policemen arresting him.
* In 2003, while training for a Davis Cup tie with Ecuador, he allegedly urinated on some men in a La Serena bar&#x27;s bathroom and was later expelled from his hotel after being accused of swimming nude. As a consequence, the Chilean team missed a flight to Ecuador the following day. He later apologized for the incidents.
* In 2003, he and a friend were expelled from a Santiago bar after insulting other clients and being involved in a brawl with some waiters. Both were arrested and later released.
* In 2018, Rios was fined $2,500 by the ITF after refusing to be interviewed in his then duty as an assistant to the Chilean Davis Cup team, and instead insulting journalists during a Davis Cup tie vs. Ecuador. He responded to the questions with: &quot;As my personal friend Diego Maradona says, I never speak to reporters as you can all suck it.&quot;
*In 2021, during an Instagram livestream, he accused Pamela Jiles, a Chilean deputy, of having tried to rape him as a 14-year-old, claiming that she had attempted to &quot;take a shower&quot; with him after an interview.

<text>The Yakuts or Sakha (, ; , ) are a Turkic ethnic group native to North Siberia, primarily the Republic of Sakha in the Russian Federation. They also inhabit some districts of the Krasnoyarsk Krai. They speak Yakut, which belongs to the Siberian branch of the Turkic languages.

==Etymology==
According to Alexey Kulakovsky, the Russian word was taken from the Evenki , while Marjorie Mandelstam Balzer claims the Russian word is actually a corruption from the Tungusic form. According to ethnographer Dávid Somfai, the Russian &quot;yakut&quot; derives from the Buryat &quot;yaqud&quot;, which is the plural form of the Buryat name for the Yakuts, &quot;yaqa&quot;. The Yakuts call themselves , or (Yakut: , ) in some old chronicles. All of these are derived from a word related to Turkish &quot;&quot; (geographical edge, collar) referring to the remote position in Siberia.

==Origin==

===Early scholarship===
An early work on the Yakut ethnogenesis was drafted by the Russian Collegiate Assessors I. Evers and S. Gornovsky in the late 18th century. At an unspecified time in the past certain tribes resided around the western shore of the Aral Sea. These peoples later migrated eastward and settled near the Tunka Goltsy mountains of modern Buryatia. Pressure from the expansionist Mongolian Empire later made many of those around the Tunka Goltsy relocate to the Lena River. Several additional Altai-Sayan region tribes later arrived on the Lena to flee from the Mongols. The subsequent cultural melding that occurred between these incoming migrants eventually created the Yakuts. The Sagay Khakas of Abakan River were presented as the origin of the ethnonym Sakha by Evers and Gornovsky.

In the mid-19th century, Nikolai S. Schukin wrote &quot;A Trip to Yakutsk” based on his experiences visiting the area. He presented a somewhat different origin of the Yakuts based upon local oral histories. Groups of Khakas inhabiting the southern Yenisey watershed migrated north to the Nizhnyaya Tunguska River to the Lena Plateau and finally onward to the Lena River. Schukin is credited as introducing the concept of Yenisey Khakas as the ancestors of the Yakut into Russian historiography. The most authoritative account in support of the Yenisey origin hypothesis was written by Nikolai N. Kozmin in 1928. He concluded that some Khakas moved from the Yenisey to the Angara River due to difficulties in the regional economy. In the 12th century Buryats arrived at Lake Baikal and through military force pushed the Khakas to the Lena.

===Lake Baikal===
In 1893, Turkologist scholar Vasily Radlov connected the Kurykans or Gǔlìgān () Tiele people from Chinese historical accounts with the Yakuts. They are mentioned as 7th-century tributaries of the Tang dynasty, reportedly living on the Angara and around Lake Baikal. Radlov hypothesized they were a mixture of Tungusic and Uyghur peoples and the forebears of the Yakut.

===Khoro===
The Khoro (Khorin, Khorolors,Khori) Yakut maintain their progenitor was Uluu Khoro, rather than Omogoy or Ellei. Scholarship has not definitively established their ancestral ethnic affiliations. Their homeland was somewhere in the south and called Khoro sire. When the Khorolors arrived in the Middle Lena remains uncertain, with scholars estimating from the first millennium to the 16th century AD.

Among scholars a commonly accepted hypothesis is that the Khoro Yakut originate from the Khori Buryat of Lake Baikal, and therefore spoke a Turko-Mongolic language. This is largely based on their similar ethnonyms. Proponents see the word Khoro as arising from the Tibetan word hor (). For example, according to G. N. Runyanstev, during the 6th through 10th centuries CE the inhabitants of Lake Baikal were called Chor. 
Okladnikov guessed that Khoro sire was near China and adjacent to the X.

This premise is not universally accepted and has been challenged by some researchers. George de Roerich has argued that the word is based on the Chinese word hu (), a term used as general reference by the Chinese to refer to various Iranian or Turkic peoples of Central Asia. In contemporary Tibetan hor is used to describe any pastoralist &quot;nomad of mixed origin&quot; regardless of their ethnonym. After researching their origins, Gavriil Ksenofontov concluded that while the Khorolors were &quot;formed from parts of some alien tribe that mixed with the Yakuts&quot;, there was no compelling evidence connecting them with the Khori Buryat.

A more recent argument by Zoriktuev proposes that the Khorolors were originally Paleo-Asians from the Lower Amur River. In contrast to their Yakut relatives, Khoro folklore focuses largely on the Raven, with some tales about the Eagle as well. In the mid 18th century Lindenau noted the Khorolors focused their religious devotion on the Raven, who was alternatively referred to as “Our ancestor”, &quot;Our deity&quot;, and “Our grandfather&quot; by the Khorolors. This reverence arises from the Raven enabling a struggling human (either the first Khoro man or his mother) to survive by giving a flint and tinder box. Their mythos is similar to cultures from both sides of the Bering Sea. The Haida, Tlingit, Tshisham of the North American Pacific Northwest Coast and the Paleoasians of the Siberian Coast like the Chukchi, Itelmen, and Koryaks all share reverence for the Raven.

===Autochthonous ancestry===
Many researchers have concluded that the Yakut ethnogenesis was an admixture of Turks migrating from Lake-Baikal and native Yukaghir and Tungusitic peoples residing around the Lena River. Okladnikov detailed this conceived admixture process as the following:&quot;...the Turkic-speaking ancestors of the Yakuts not only pushed out the aborigines but also subjected them to their influence by peaceful means; they assimilated and absorbed them into their mass... With this, the local tribes lost the former ethnic name and a proper ethnic consciousness, no longer separating themselves from the mass of Yakuts, and [were] not opposed to them... Consequently, as a result of the mixing with Northern aborigines, the southern ancestors of the Yakuts supplemented their culture and language with new features distinguishing them from other steppe tribes.&quot;

Traditional Yakut histories contain stories of the aboriginal peoples of Yakutia. From the subarctic Bulunsky and Verkhoyansky Districts, accounts state that the Black Yukaghir (Yakut: хара дъукаагырдар) descended from migrants pushed north from the Lena River. Related stories recorded in Ust&#x27;-Aldanskiy Ulus and Megino-Kangalassky District mention certain tribes leaving the region due to rising pressure from the incoming Yakuts. While some remained and intermarried with the newcomer, most went to the northern tundra.

====Ymyyakhtakh====
The Ymyyakhtakh are an ancient people of the Lena River. A burial ground was excavated and anthropologists I.I. Gokhman and L.F. Tomtosova studied the human remains and published their results in 1992. They concluded that some of the Late Neolithic population took part in the formation of the modern Yakuts. The consistency of related artistic embellishments on the traditional clothing of the Buryat, Samoyed, and Yakut led one scholar to conclude they are related. Toponymic data of Yakutia indicates there was once a presence of Paleoasian and Samoyed habitation in the region. Vilyui Tumats reportedly practiced anthropophagy and seen as an &quot;ethnocultural marker&quot; of the Samoyedic peoples.

====Tumats====
The Tumat stand out in Yakut tradition as a numerous and powerful society, with constant conflict once happening with them on the Vilyuy River. Their households were semi-subterranean with sod roofing and are comparable to traditional Samoyed dwellings. The term Doubo () was used in medieval Chinese historical works in reference to the Sayano-Altai forest peoples. Vasily Radlov concluded that Doubo referred to the Samoyedic peoples. Doubo is additionally seen as the origin of the ethnonym &quot;Tumat&quot; by L. P. Potapov.

The Yakuts called the Tumat people &quot;Dyirikinei&quot; or &quot;chipmunk people&quot; (Yakut: Sдьирикинэй), arising from the Tumatian &quot;tail-coat.&quot; Bundles of deer fur were dyed with red ocher and sewn into Tumatian jackets as adornments. Tumat hats were likewise dyed red. This style was likely spread by the Tumatians to some Tungusic peoples. Similar clothing has been reported during the 17th century for the Evenks on the upper Angara and for Evens residing on the lower Kolyma in the early 19th century. Additionally there are many similarities between the clothing of the Tumats and Altaic cultures. Archeological work on Pazyryk culture sites have turned up both hats dyed red and tail-coats made of sables. While the &quot;tails&quot; were not dyed red, they were sewn with red dyed thread. Stylistic and design choices are also comparable to traditional Khakas and Kumandin clothing.

Some peaceable interactions including intermarriage did occur with the Tumats. One such example is the life of Džaardaakh (), a Tumatian woman. She was renowned for her physical strength and martial repute as an archer. However Džaardaakh eventually married a Yakut man and is considered a notable ancestor of the local Vilyuy Yakut. The origin of her name has been linked to a Yukaghir word for ice (Yukaghir: йархан).

The ancestors of Yakuts were Kurykans who migrated from Yenisey river to Lake Baikal and were subject to a certain Mongolian admixture prior to migration in the 7th century. The Yakuts originally lived around Olkhon and the region of Lake Baikal. Beginning in the 13th century they migrated to the basins of the Middle Lena, the Aldan and Vilyuy rivers under the pressure of the rising Mongols. The northern Yakuts were largely hunters, fishermen and reindeer herders, while the southern Yakuts raised cattle and horses.

==History==

===Imperial Russia===
In the 1620s, the Tsardom of Muscovy began to move into their territory and annexed or settled down on it, imposed a fur tax and managed to suppress several Yakut rebellions between 1634 and 1642. The tsarist brutality in collection of the pelt tax (&quot;yasak&quot;) sparked a rebellion and aggression among the Yakuts and also Tungusic-speaking tribes along the River Lena in 1642. The voivode Peter Golovin, leader of the tsarist forces, responded with a reign of terror: native settlements were torched and hundreds of people were killed. The Yakut population alone is estimated to have fallen by 70 percent between 1642 and 1682, mainly because of smallpox and other infectious diseases.

In the 18th century the Russians reduced the pressure, gave Yakut chiefs some privileges, granted freedom for all inhabitants, gave them all their lands, sent Eastern Orthodox missions, and educated the Yakut people regarding agriculture. The discovery of gold and, later, the building of the Trans-Siberian Railway, brought ever-increasing numbers of Russians into the region. By the 1820s almost all the Yakuts claimed to have converted to the Russian Orthodox church, but they retained (and still retain) a number of shamanist practices. Yakut literature began to rise in the late 19th century, and a national revival occurred in the early 20th century.

===Russian Civil War===
The last conflict of the Russian Civil War, known as the Yakut Revolt, occurred here when Cornet Mikhail Korobeinikov, a White Russian officer, led an uprising and a last stand against the Red Army.

===Soviet Union===
In 1922, the new Soviet government named the area the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In the late 1920s through the late 1930s, Yakut people were systematically persecuted, when Joseph Stalin launched his collectivization campaign. It is possible that hunger and malnutrition during this period resulted in a decline in the Yakut total population from 240,500 in 1926 to 236,700 in 1959. By 1972, the population began to recover.

===Russian Federation===
Currently, Yakuts form a large plurality of the total population within the vast Republic of Sakha. According to the 2010 Russian census, there were a total of 466,492 Yakuts residing in the Sakha Republic during that year, or 49.9% of the total population of the Republic.

==Culture==


The Yakuts engage in animal husbandry, traditionally having focused on rearing horses, mainly the Yakutian horse, reindeer and the (&#x27;Yakutian cow&#x27;), a hardy kind of cattle known as Yakutian cattle which is well adapted to the harsh local weather. There is a widespread notion among other ethnic minorities in Russia based on their experience (for example, among geographically close Mongolic Buryats) that the Sakha (i.e. Yakuts) are the least russified ethnic group in Russia and that the knowledge of the native language is widespread, particularly (as is often said) due to the cold and freezing nature of their geographical habitat, and Russians’ general avoidance of colonizing those lands.

Certain rock formations named Kigilyakh, as well as places such as Ynnakh Mountain, are held in high esteem by Yakuts.

==Cuisine==

The cuisine of Sakha prominently features the traditional drink kumis, dairy products of cow, mare, and reindeer milk, sliced frozen salted fish stroganina (), loaf meat dishes (), venison, frozen fish, thick pancakes, and —a millet porridge with butter and horse fat. () or , a popular dessert, is made of cow milk or cream with various berries. is a traditional fish salad. This cuisine is only used in Yakutia.

==Language==
According to the 2010 census, some 87% of the Yakuts in the Sakha Republic are fluent in the Yakut (or Sakha) language, while 90% are fluent in Russian. The Sakha/Yakut language belongs to the Northern branch of the Siberian Turkic languages. It is most closely related to the Dolgan language, and also to a lesser extent related to Tuvan and Shor.

==DNA and genetics analysis==
The primary Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup for the Yakut is N-M231. While found in around 89% of the general population, in northern Yakutia it is closer to 82%. N-M231 is shared with various other Eastern Siberian populations. The remaining haplogroups are approximately: 4% C-M217 (including subclades C-M48 and C-M407), 3.5% R1a-M17 (including subclade R1a-M458), and 2.1% N-P43, with sporadic instances of I-M253, R1b-M269, J2, and Q.

According to Adamov, haplogroup N1c1 makes up 94% of the Sakha population. This genetic bottleneck has been dated approximately to 1300 CE ± 200 ybp and speculated to have been caused by high mortality rates in warfare and later relocation to the Middle Lena River.

The primary mitochondrial DNA haplogroups are various East Asian lineages, making up 92% of the total: haplogroup C at 36% to 45.7% and haplogroup D at 25.7% to 32.9% of the Yakut. Minor Eastern Eurasian mtDNA haplogroups include: 5.2% G, 4.49% F, 3.55% M13a1b, 1.89% A, 1.18% Y1a, 1.18% B, 0.95% Z3, and 0.71% M7. According to Fedorova, besides East Asian maternal lineages, &quot;the mtDNA pool of the native populations of Sakha contains a small (8%), but diverse set of western Eurasian mtDNA haplogroups, mostly present among Yakuts and Evenks&quot;, the most common being H and J.

==Diaspora==
The Sakha American Cultural Association, a non-profit organization established in Seattle, Washington in 2024 

&quot;The Sakha people had made a temporary footprint in the U.S. in 1820 at Fort Ross in Jenner, California. According to the 1820 census, five Sakha men lived in the fort with 260 people, working for the Russian-American Company, a fur-trading business. This fort became a melting pot of different cultures, including Russians, Native Alaskans and local Native American tribes, such as the Kashaya Pomo. The Sakha were part of the diverse workforce that supported the fort operations in areas, such as hunting, trapping, farming and construction. By 1860, there were at least 20 Sakhas living at Fort Ross before the Russian-American Company ended its North American operations in the early 1880s.&quot; - Lynnwood Today

<doc id="483566" wikidata="Q951841" url="?curid=483566" title="Law of Japan">
<text>The law of Japan refers to the legal system in Japan, which is primarily based on legal codes and statutes, with precedents also playing an important role. Japan has a civil law legal system with six legal codes, which were greatly influenced by Germany, to a lesser extent by France, and also adapted to Japanese circumstances. The Japanese Constitution enacted after World War II is the supreme law in Japan. An independent judiciary has the power to review laws and government acts for constitutionality.

==Historical developments== 
===Early Japan===
The early laws of Japan are believed to have been heavily influenced by Chinese law. Little is known about Japanese law prior to the seventh century, when the Ritsuryō was developed and codified. Before Chinese characters were adopted and adapted by the Japanese, the Japanese had no known writing system with which to record their history. Chinese characters were known to the Japanese in earlier centuries, but the process of assimilation of these characters into their indigenous language system took place in the third century. This was due to the willingness of the Japanese to borrow aspects of the culture of continental civilisations, which was achieved mainly via adjacent countries such as the Korean kingdoms rather than directly from the Chinese mainland empires.

Two of the most significant systems of human philosophy and religion, Confucianism (China) and Buddhism (India), were officially transplanted in 284–285 and 522 AD respectively, and became deeply acculturated into indigenous Japanese thought and ethics. David and Zweigert and Kotz argue that the old Chinese doctrines of Confucius, which emphasize social/group/community harmony rather than individual interests, have been very influential in the Japanese society, with the consequence that individuals tend to avoid litigation in favour of compromise and conciliation.

It is theorized by some that the flow of immigrants was accelerated by both internal and external circumstances. The external factors were the continuing political instability and turmoil in Korea, as well as the struggle for central hegemony amongst the Chinese dynasties, kingdoms, warlords, invasions and other quarrels. These disturbances produced a large number of refugees who were exiled or forced to escape from their homelands. Immigrants to Japan may have included privileged classes, such as experienced officials and excellent technicians who were hired in the Japanese court, and were included in the official rank system which had been introduced by the immigrants themselves. It is conceivable – but unknown – that other legal institutions were also introduced, although partially rather than systematically, and this was probably the first transplantation of foreign law to Japan.

During these periods, Japanese law was unwritten and immature, and thus was far from comprising any official legal system. Nonetheless, Japanese society could not have functioned without some sort of law, however unofficial. Glimpses of the law regulating people&#x27;s social lives may be guessed at by considering the few contemporary general descriptions in Chinese historical books. The most noted of these is The Record on the Men of Wa, which was found in the Wei History, describing the Japanese state called Yamatai (or Yamato) ruled by the Queen Himiko in the second and third centuries. According to this account, Japanese indigenous law was based on the clan system, with each clan forming a collective unit of Japanese society. A clan comprised extended families and was controlled by its chief, who protected the rights of the members and enforced their duties with occasional punishments for crimes. The law of the court organised the clan chiefs into an effective power structure, in order to control the whole of society through the clan system. The form of these laws is not clearly known, but they may be characterised as indigenous and unofficial, as official power can rarely be identified.

In this period, a more powerful polity and a more developed legal system than the unofficial clan law of the struggling clan chiefs was required effectively to govern the society as a whole. Yamatai must have been the first central government which succeeded in securing the required power through the leadership of Queen Himiko, who was reputed to be a shaman. This leads to the assertion that Yamatai had its own primitive system of law, perhaps court law, which enabled it to maintain government over competing clan laws. As a result, the whole legal system formed a primitive legal pluralism of court law and clan law. It can also be asserted that this whole legal system was ideologically founded on the indigenous postulate which adhered to the shamanistic religio-political belief in polytheistic gods and which was called kami and later developed into Shintoism.

Two qualifications can be added to these assertions. First, some Korean law must have been transplanted, albeit unsystematically; this can be seen by the rank system in court law and the local customs among settled immigrants. Second, official law was not clearly distinguished from unofficial law; this was due to the lack of written formalities, although court law was gradually emerging into a formal state law as far as central government was concerned. For these reasons, it cannot be denied that a primitive legal pluralism had developed based on court and clan law, partially with Korean law and overwhelmingly with indigenous law. These traits of legal pluralism, however primitive, were the prototype of the Japanese legal system which developed in later periods into more organised legal pluralisms.

=== Ritsuryō system ===

In 604, Prince Shotoku established the Seventeenth-article Constitution, which differed from modern constitutions in that it was also moral code for the bureaucracy and aristocracy. While it was influenced by Buddhism, it also showed a desire to establish a political system centered on the emperor, with the help of a coalition of noble families. Nevertheless, there are doubts that the document was fabricated later.

Japan began to dispatch envoys to China&#x27;s Sui Dynasty in 607. Later, in 630, the first Japanese envoy to the Tang Dynasty was dispatched. The envoys learned of Tang Dynasty&#x27;s laws, as a mechanism to support China&#x27;s centralized state. Based on the Tang code, various systems of law, known as the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; (律令), were enacted in Japan, especially during the Taika Reform. &quot;Ritsu&quot; (律) is the equivalent of today&#x27;s criminal law, while &quot;ryō&quot; (令) provides for administrative organization, taxation, and corvée (the people&#x27;s labor obligations), similar to today&#x27;s administrative law. Other provisions correspond to modern family law and procedural law. Ritsuryō was strongly influenced by Confucian ethics. Unlike Roman law, there was no concept of private law and there was no direct mentioning of contracts and other private law concepts.

One major reform on the law was the Taihō (Great Law) Code, promulgated in 702. Within the central government, the law codes established offices of the &quot;Daijō daijin&quot; (chancellor), who presided over the Dajōkan (Grand Council of State), which included the Minister of the Left, the Minister of the Right, eight central government ministries, and a prestigious Ministry of Deities. These ritsuryō positions would be mostly preserved until the Meiji Restoration, although substantive power would for a long time fall to the &quot;bakufu&quot; (shogunate) established by the samurai. Locally, Japan was reorganized into 66 imperial provinces and 592 counties, with appointed governors.

=== Laws under the shogunates ===
Beginning in the 9th century, the Ritsuryo system began to break down. As the power of the manor lords (荘園領主) grew stronger, the manor lords&#x27; estate laws (&quot;honjohō&quot; 本所法) began to develop. Furthermore, as the power of the samurai rose, samurai laws (武家法 &quot;bukehō&quot;) came to be established. In the early Kamakura period, the power of the imperial court in Kyoto remained strong, and a dual legal order existed with samurai laws and &quot;Kuge&quot; laws (公家法 &quot;kugehō&quot;), the latter having developed on the basis of old Ritsuryo laws.

In 1232, Hojo Yasutoki of the Kamakura Shogunate established the &quot;Goseibai Shikimoku&quot;, a body of samurai laws consisting of precedents, reasons and customs in samurai society from the time of Minamoto no Yoritomo, and which clarified the standards for judging the settlement of disputes between &quot;gokenin&quot; and between &quot;gokenin&quot; and manor lords. It was the first systematic code for the samurai class. Later, the Ashikaga shogunate more or less adopted the &quot;Goseibai Shikimoku&quot; as well.

In the Sengoku period (1467–1615), the daimyos developed feudal laws (&quot;bunkokuhō&quot; 分国法) in order to establish order in their respective territories. Most such laws sought to improve the military and economic power of the warring lords, including instituting the &quot;rakuichi rakuza&quot; (楽市・楽座) policy, which dissolved guilds and allowed some free marketplaces, and the principle of &quot;kenka ryōseibai&quot; (喧嘩両成敗), which punished both sides involved in brawls.

In the Edo period (1603–1868), the Tokugawa shogunate established the &quot;bakuhan taisei&quot; (幕藩体制), a feudal political system. The shogunate also promulgated laws and collection of precedents, such as the Laws for the Military Houses (武家諸法度 &quot;Buke shohatto&quot;) and the &quot;Kujikata Osadamegaki&quot; (公事方御定書). It also issued the Laws for the Imperial and Court Officials (禁中並公家諸法度 &quot;kinchū narabini kuge shohatto&quot;), which set out the relationship between the shogunate, the imperial family and the &quot;kuge&quot;, and the Laws on Religious Establishments (寺院諸法度 &quot;jiin shohatto&quot;).

The Code of One Hundred Articles (御定書百箇条 &quot;osadamegaki hyakkajyō&quot;) was part of the &quot;Kujikata Osadamegaki&quot;. It consisted of mostly criminal laws and precedents, and was compiled and issued in 1742, under the eighth Tokugawa shogun, Yoshimune. Crimes punished include forgery, harboring runaway servants, abandonment of infants, adultery, gambling, theft, receiving stolen goods, kidnapping, blackmailing, arson, killing and wounding. Punishment ranged from banishment to various forms of execution, the most lenient of which is decapitation; others include burning at the stake and public sawing before execution. The justice system often employed torture as a means to obtain a confession, which was required for executions. Punishment was often extended to the culprit&#x27;s family as well as the culprit.

Justice in the Edo period was very much based on one&#x27;s status. Following neo-Confucian ideas, the populace was divided into classes, with the samurai on top. Central power was exercised to various degrees by the shogun and shogunate officials, who were appointed from the daimyo, similar to the Curia Regis of medieval England. Certain conducts of daimyos and the samurai were subject to the shogunate&#x27;s laws, and shogunate administrative officials would perform judicial functions. Daimyos had considerable autonomy within their domains (&quot;han&quot;) and issued their own edicts. Daimyos and the samurai also exercised considerable arbitrary power over other classes, such as peasants or the &quot;chōnin&quot; (townspeople). For example, a samurai is permitted to summarily execute petty townspeople or peasants if they behaved rudely towards him, although such executions were rarely carried out. Because official treatment was often harsh, villages (&quot;mura&quot;) and the &quot;chōnin&quot; often resolved disputes internally, based on written or unwritten codes and customs.

===Modern developments and Japanese law today===

==== Legal reforms after the Meiji Restoration ====
Major reforms in Japanese law took place with the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the Meiji Restoration in the late 1800s. At the beginning of the Meiji Era (1868–1912), the Japanese populace and politicians quickly accepted the need to import western legal system as part of the modernization effort, leading to a rather smooth transition in law. Under the influence of western ideas, the Emperor proclaimed in 1881 that a Nation Diet (parliament) would be established, and the first Japanese Constitution (Meiji Constitution) was ‘granted’ to the subjects by the Emperor in 1889. Japan&#x27;s Meiji Constitution emulated the German constitution with broad imperial powers; British and French systems were considered but were abandoned because they were seen as too liberal and democratic. Elections took place for the lower house, with voters consisting of males paying a certain amount of tax, about 1% of the population.

With a new government and a new constitution, Japan began to systematically reforming its legal system. Reformers had two goals in mind: first, to consolidate power under the new imperial government; second, to &quot;modernize&quot; the legal system and establish enough credibility to abolish unequal treaties signed with western governments.

The early modernization of Japanese law was primarily based on European civil law systems and, to a lesser extent, English and American common law elements. Chinese-style criminal codes (Ming and Qing codes) and past Japanese codes (Ritsuryo) were initially considered as models but abandoned. European legal systems – especially German and French civil law – were the primary models for the Japanese legal system, although they were often substantially modified before adoption. Court cases and subsequent revisions of the code also lessened the friction between the new laws and established social practice. The draft Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (German civil code) served as the model for the Japanese Civil Code. For this reason, scholars have argued that the Japanese legal system is a descendant of the Romano-Germanic civil law legal system.

Laws on censorship and laws aimed to control political and labor movements were enacted in the Meiji era, curtailing the freedom of association. By the 1920s, laws were amended so that leaders of organizations that advocated for Marxism or changing the imperial structure could be put to death.

In the 1910s, a movement for more democracy developed and there were several cabinet supported by elected political parties. Before this, the &quot;genrō&quot; (leaders of the Meiji Restoration) would privately confer and recommend Prime Minister candidates and cabinet members to the Emperor. Reforms in this period include the General Election Law, which abolished property qualifications and allowed almost all men over age 25 to vote for members of the House of Representatives (the lower house), although the House of Peers was still controlled by the aristocracy. Voting rights was never extended to the colonies, like Korea, although colonial subjects who moved to Japan could vote after the 1925 reforms.

However, cabinets based on party politics were powerless against growing interference by the Japanese military. The army and navy had seats in the cabinet, and their refusal to serve in a cabinet would force its dissolution. A series of rebellions and coups weakened the Diet, leading to military rule by 1936.

During the Japanese invasion of China and the Pacific War, Japan was turned into a totalitarian state, which continued until Japan&#x27;s defeat at 1945.

==== Japanese law post-World War II ====
After the Second World War, Allied military forces (overwhelmingly American) supervised and controlled the Japanese government. Japanese law underwent major reform under the guidance and direction of Occupation authorities. American law was the strongest influence, at times replacing and at times overlaid onto existing rules and structures. The Constitution, criminal procedure, and labor law, all crucial for the protection of human rights, and corporate law, were substantially revised. Major reforms on gender equality, education, democratization, economic reform and land reform were introduced.

The post war Japanese Constitution proclaimed that sovereignty rested with the people, deprived the Emperor of political powers, and strengthened the powers of the Diet, which is to be elected by universal suffrage. The Constitution also renounced war, introduced a Bill of Rights, and authorized judicial review. On gender equality, women were enfranchised for the first time in the 1946 election, and the Civil Code provisions on family law and succession were systematically revised. Laws also legalized labor unions, reformed the education system, and dissolved business conglomerates (Zaibatsu). Capital punishment was kept as a punishment for certain serious crimes. However, Japan retained its civil law legal system and did not adopt an American common law legal system.

Therefore, the Japanese legal system today is essentially a hybrid of civilian and common law structures, with strong underlying &quot;flavors&quot; from indigenous Japanese and Chinese characteristics. While historical aspects remain active in the present, Japanese law also represents a dynamic system that has undergone major reforms and changes in the past two decades as well.
==Sources of law==
=== The Constitution ===

The present national authorities and legal system are constituted upon the adoption of the Constitution of Japan in 1947. The Constitution contains thirty-three articles relating to human rights and articles providing for the separation of powers vested into three independent bodies: the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary. Laws, ordinances and government acts that violate the Constitution do not have legal effect, and courts are authorized to judicially review acts for conformity with the constitution.

The National Diet is the bicameral supreme legislative body of Japan, consisting of the House of Councillors (upper house) and House of Representatives (lower house). Article 41 of the Constitution provides that &quot;the Diet shall be the highest organ of State power, and shall be the sole law-making organ of the State.&quot; Statutory law originates from the National Diet, with the approval of the Emperor as a formality. Under the current constitution, unlike the Meiji Constitution, the Emperor does not have the power to veto or otherwise refuse to approve a law passed by the Diet, or exercise emergency powers.

===The Six Codes in modern Japanese law===

The modernization of Japanese law by transplanting law from Western countries began after the Meiji Restoration in 1868, in which the Japanese Emperor was officially restored to political power. Japanese law is primarily inspired by the Civilian system in continental Europe, which emphasizes codified statutes (&quot;codes&quot;) that set out the basic legal framework in a particular area of law.

The first major legislation enacted in Japan was the Criminal Code of 1880, followed by the Constitution of the Empire of Japan in 1889, the Commercial Code, Criminal Procedure Act and Civil Procedure Act in 1890 and the Civil Code in 1896 and 1898. These were called the &quot;roppo&quot; (six codes) and the term began to be used to mean the whole of Japan&#x27;s statute law. The &quot;roppo&quot; thus included administrative law of both central and local government and international law in the treaties and agreements of the new government under the emperor (in addition to former agreements with the United States and other countries, which had been entered into by the Tokugawa Shogunate).

The Six Codes are now:

# The Civil Code (民法 Minpō, 1896)
# The Commercial Code (商法 Shōhō, 1899)
# The Criminal Code (刑法 Keihō, 1907)
# The Constitution of Japan (日本国憲法 Nippon-koku-kenpō, 1946)
# The Code of Criminal Procedure (刑事訴訟法 Keiji-soshō-hō, 1948)
# The Code of Civil Procedure (民事訴訟法 Minji-soshō-hō, 1996)

The Civil Code, Commercial Code and the Criminal Code were enacted in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. Parts of the Civil Code on family and inheritance were totally amended after World War II to achieve gender equality. Other codes were also periodically amended. For example, company law was separated from the Civil Code in 2005. The Japanese Civil Code has had a significant role in the development of civil law in several East Asian nations including South Korea and the Republic of China (Taiwan).

=== Other sources of law ===

==== Statutes ====
In addition to the six codes, there are individual statutes on more specific matters which are not codified. For example, in the area of administrative law, there isn&#x27;t a comprehensive administrative code. Instead, individual statutes such as the Cabinet Law, the Law on Administrative Litigation, the Law on Compensation by the State, City Planning Law, and other statutes all concern administrative law. Similarly, in the domain of labor and employment law, there are statutes such as the Labor Standards Law, the Trade Union Law, the Law on the Adjustment of Labor Relations, and the newly enacted Labor Contract Law. Other important statutes include the Banking Law, the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law, the Anti-Monopoly Law (competition law), the Patent Law, Copyright Law, and the Trademark Law.

In general, provisions of a specialized law take precedence over a more general law if there is a conflict. Thus, when provisions of the Civil Code and the Commercial Code both apply to a situation, the latter takes priority.

==== Delegated legislation ====
The Constitution is the supreme law in Japan; below it are statutes enacted by the Diet, then Cabinet orders (&quot;seirei&quot;), then ministerial ordinances. Article 11 of the Cabinet Law (Japanese: ), provides that Cabinet orders may not impose duties or restrict rights of citizens, unless such a power is delegated by statute. This rule reflects the traditional understanding of broad executive understanding developed under the 1889 Constitution. Under this principle, a Cabinet order can authorize government subsidies without statutory sanction, but cannot levy taxes. Other theories suggest that the 1947 Constitution requires a broader need for statutory authorization, on matters that do not restrict rights of citizens, such as on fiscal transfers to local governments, the pension system, or the unemployment system. The Law on the Organisation of State Administration provides authorizes ministerial ordinances to implement laws and cabinet orders, as long as it is specifically delegated by statute or cabinet order (Art. 12, para. 1).

Delegated legislation is implicitly recognized under Art. 73, para. 6 of the Constitution, which states that cabinet orders may not include criminal sanctions unless delegated by law. Delegations to the cabinet must not undermine the supremacy of the Diet in law-making and must be specific and concrete. The Supreme Court tend to allow broad delegations of power to the government.

==== Administrative rules, guidances and local regulations ====
Ministries and administrative agencies also issue circulars (&quot;tsutatsu&quot;), which are regarded as administrative rules rather than legislation. They are not a source of law but are instead internal guidelines; despite this, they can be very important in practice. Ministries also issue non-binding administrative guidances (written or oral), which has been criticized as opaque. The Law on Administrative Procedure prohibits retaliation in cases where persons do not follow government administrative guidances and some ministries attempted to codify them in cabinet orders and ministerial ordinances.

Local authorities may issue local regulations under Art. 94 of the Constitution and Law on Local Self-Administration, as long as they are not contrary to law. The law also authorizes local regulations to impose punishments including up to two years’ imprisonment or a fine of 1,000,000 yen.

====Precedent====

In the civil law system of Japan, courts follow the doctrine of &quot;jurisprudence constante&quot; under which judicial precedent provides non-binding guidance on how laws should be interpreted in practice. Judges seriously consider a series of similar precedents, especially any pertinent Supreme Court decisions, thus making understanding of precedent essential to practice. For example, the field of tort law originated from one intentionally general provision in the Civil Code (Art. 709) and was developed by a substantial body of case law. Similar developments are seen in the fields of administrative, labor, and landlord and tenant law.

Despite the importance of case law, &quot;stare decisis&quot; has no formal basis in Japanese law. Courts are in theory free to deviate from precedents and have from time to time done so, although they risk being reversed by a higher court. In addition, Japanese judges are generally career judges whose promotion and transfer can be greatly affected by the Supreme Court. Because of this, scholars have commented that Supreme Court decisions are &quot;de facto&quot; even more binding than in common law countries. Dicta by the Supreme Court is also often cited by lower courts.

Scholars and practising lawyers often comment on judicial judgments, which can then affect future judicial reasoning.

==Private law==

Japanese civil law (concerning the relationship between private individuals, also known as private law) includes the Civil Code, the Commercial Code, and various supplemental laws. Civil law is the same throughout the country, and punishments and &quot;provisions governing criminal offences&quot; are found in the Penal Code of Japan.

The Civil Code of Japan (民法 Minpō) was created in 1896. It was heavily influenced by the 1887 &quot;draft&quot; of the German Civil Code, and to a lesser extent the French Civil Code. The code is divided into five books:

# Book One is the General Part (総則), which includes basic rules and definitions of Japanese civil law, such as the capacity of natural and legal persons, juridical acts, and agency.
# Book Two is entitled Real Rights (物権) and covers property and security rights over real property.
# Book Three is the Law of Obligations (債権). Like in other civil law countries, tort law is considered one source from which an obligation emerges, together with unjust enrichment, and contract law.
# Book Four deals with family relations (親族), including marriage and guardianship.
# Book Five covers inheritance (相続), including wills and succession.

After World War II, sections dealing with family law and succession (books four and five) were fully revised during the occupation and brought closer to European civil law. This was because the parts on family and succession had retained certain vestiges of the old patriarchal family system that was the basis of Japanese feudalism. Other parts of the Civil Code remained substantially unchanged even after the occupation.

Numerous laws have been enacted to supplement the Civil Code as soon as it was adopted, including laws on the Registration of Real Property (1899) and the Law on Deposits (1899). The 1991 Law on Land and Building Leases merged three previous statutes on buildings, house leases and land leases. Special laws on torts such as Nuclear Damage (1961), Pollution (1971) and Traffic Accidents (1955) were also enacted to supplement the Civil Code. Other laws include the 1994 Product Liability Law and the 2000 Consumer Contract Law.

The Commercial Code (商法 Shōhō) is divided into the General Part, Commercial Transactions, and Merchant Shipping and Insurance. It was modeled on the German Commercial Code (&quot;Handelsgesetzbuch&quot;) of 1897 but with some French influence. The Commercial Code is considered a specialized law, meaning it take precedence over the Civil Code if both laws apply.

The Commercial Code also authorizes applying commercial custom over the Civil Code. Certain acts, such as buying properties with intention of reselling for profit as defined as commercial per se, while other acts are governed by the Commercial Code depending on whether the actors are businesses or merchants. The Code is supplemented by various other laws such as the Law on Cheques, the Law on Bills, and the Law on Commercial Registration. A Company Law was separated from the Commercial Code in 2005.

=== General provisions ===
Article 1 of the Civil Code, in the General Part (総則), emphasized public welfare, prohibited the abuse of rights, and required good faith and fair dealing. Similar provisions can be found in French and German law. These provisions are often invoked by Japanese courts to reach equitable results. For example, good faith and fair dealing was used to justify piercing the corporate veil, protecting tenants from evictions in certain cases, and developing the doctrine of unfair dismissal under employment law. The prohibition on abuse of rights was also invoked by courts in cases even where there is no contractual relationship.

The Civil Code&#x27;s General Part also defines rights capacity (; German: ), which is the legal capacity to hold rights, assume duties, and incur liabilities through juridical acts (). Juridical acts are all declarations of will with specific legal consequences, including contracts, quasi-contracts, wills, gifts, torts, and incorporation. All living natural persons (and in some cases, unborn fetuses) have such private rights, which enable them to inherit property and claim damages in tort cases. Despite having full rights capacity, some persons&#x27; transactional capacity (; German: ) is limited. These include minors and certain adults under guardianship, whose acts may be rescinded if done without their legal guardian&#x27;s consent. Legal persons also have legal capacity; they include foundations and associations (businesses and non-profits), with for-profit associations being companies subject to the Company Law. Acts by legal persons may be &quot;ultra vires&quot; if they exceed their scope of purposes.

===Contracts===

Japanese contract law is based mostly on the Civil Code, which defines the rights and obligations of the parties in general and in certain types of contracts, and the Commercial Code for certain commercial transactions. The Commercial Code is considered a specialized law, meaning it take precedence over the Civil Code if both laws apply. Contracts, along with wills, gifts and other acts with legal consequences, are considered juridical acts; and are governed by the Civil Code when the Commercial Code and commercial custom do not apply.

A contract requires the coinciding of the minds, with an offer and an acceptance. Parties must act in good faith when negotiating a contract and may need to disclose information before contracting in some situations. Consideration is not required and gifts are also considered contracts. Certain types of contract, such as suretyships or the purchase of farm land may require certain formalities, such as a written contract or administrative approval.

The Civil Code lists 13 nominate contracts, including: gift, sale, exchange, loan for consumption (&quot;mutuum&quot;), loan for use (&quot;commodatum&quot;), lease, employment, hire of services, mandate, deposit (consignment), partnership, life annuity, and settlement (&quot;transactio&quot;). The Commercial Code also includes typical commercial contracts, such as: sale, articles of incorporation, carriage of goods, warehousing, and insurance. Commercial contracts between Japanese companies are often brief, with parties preferring to leave certain possibilities open and negotiate for a mutually acceptable response instead of setting out detailed terms in writing. Courts sometimes prevent the termination or non-renewal of contracts when there is a strong reliance interest at stake, citing the duty to act in good faith.

Contracts are sometimes void because they go against public order or good morals (&quot;contra bonos mores&quot;), or because a party lacked good faith and fair dealing. Examples include gambling contracts, contracts that limited a person&#x27;s right to withdraw from a union, and contracts that violate consumer protection laws. Contracts in areas such as leases, employment and consumer transactions are subject to additional regulation by law.

Contractual consent can sometimes be defective due to vitiating factors (German: ), such as duress, fraud, mistake, or jests. In such cases, the law contains rules that balance the interests of the obligor, the obligee, and third parties, based partially on their states of mind and whether they acted in good faith. Some contracts are voidable, meaning that they are valid until a contracting party rescinds the contract.

===Torts===
Like the French Civil Code, the Japanese Civil Code only has a single provision on tort liability. Article 709 of the Civil Code states: &quot;A person who intentionally or negligently violates the rights of others shall be liable for the loss caused by the act.&quot; Tort law was gradually developed largely based on case law, including cases on pollution. Statutes outside the Civil Code also regulate specific types of torts, such as the Law on the Compensation of Losses arising from Car Accidents enacted in 1955, the 1973 Law on the Remedies of Harm Caused to Human Health by Pollution, or the 1994 Law on Product Liability.

In a 1990 article, Takao Tanase posited that the calculated structuring of governmental and legal processes, not a cultural propensity toward harmonious social relations, accounted for the persistently low litigation rate in Japan. In Japan in 1986, fewer than 1% of automobile accidents involving death or an injury resulted in litigation, compared to 21.5% in the United States. The litigation rate was low, Tanase said, because Japan provides non-litigious methods of assessing fault, advising victims, determining compensation, and ensuring payment. Non-litigious dispute resolution mechanisms, mediation services, consultation centers operated by governments, the bar association, and insurance companies. The Japanese judiciary also works hard at developing clear, detailed rules that guarantee virtually automatic, predictable, moderate compensation for most accident victims. This contrasts with the American tort system, where the legal rules concerning both liability and general damages (i.e. non-economic loss) are stated in general terms, leaving a great deal to the judgment of constantly rotating lay juries—which in turn makes courtroom outcomes variable and difficult to predict.

The result was a system that is vastly more efficient and reliable in delivering compensation than the American tort system. Tanase estimated that legal fees comprised only 2% of the total compensation paid to injured persons. In the United States in the late 1980s, according to two big studies of motor vehicle accident tort claims (not just lawsuits), payments to lawyers equaled 47% of the total personal injury benefits paid by insurers. This expense drives up the cost of insurance to the point that huge numbers of drivers are uninsured or under-insured, which means that victims of their negligent driving will get little or nothing from the tort system.

===Property===
Property law is outlined in Book Two of the Civil Code. Real rights () concern the rights of a person over a thing, a right &quot;in rem&quot; rather than &quot;in personam.&quot; Real rights in a thing are good against all the world (&quot;erga omnes&quot;), in contrast to personal rights which can only be claimed against specific parties. Property is classified into immovables (i.e. real property) and movables (i.e. personal property); different types of property are sometimes subject to different rules. For example, while registration of transfers of immovable property is not required, it is necessary for one to claim rights against a third party.

Like other civil codes, the Japanese Civil Code classifies types of property rights, including: ownership, surface rights (aka &quot;superficies&quot;), emphyteusis, servitudes (i.e. easements), and commonage (collective rights over land, such as forests). Real rights in security include: liens, preferential rights, pledge, and mortgage.

Japan has gradually strengthened the rights of the tenant, such that landlords are generally not allowed to unilaterally terminate leases without &quot;just cause&quot;. Many landlords are forced to buy out their tenants if they wish to demolish buildings to make way for new development: one well-known contemporary instance is the Roppongi Hills complex, which offered several previous tenants special deals on apartments.

Despite this emphasis on tenant rights, the government exercises a formidable eminent domain power and can expropriate land for any public purpose as long as reasonable compensation is afforded. This power was famously used in the wake of World War II to dismantle the estates of the defunct peerage system and sell their land to farmers at very cheap rates (one historical reason for agriculture&#x27;s support of LDP governments). Narita International Airport is another well-known example of eminent domain power in Japan.

===Civil Procedure===
The Code of Civil Procedure ( ) is the basic law on civil procedure. The reformed Code came into effect in 1998. After an initial complaint to the court, the Court schedules the first session of the oral proceeding. The court clerk serves a summons on the defendant to notify him of the date of the first session, along with a copy of the complaint and documentary evidence. The defendant&#x27;s lawyer must then file an answer to the complaint. At the first session of the oral proceeding after the filing of the complaint and answer, the judge decides whether the case should proceed under the Preparatory Proceeding. A Preparatory Proceeding is closed to the public and held chiefly to identify the key issues of the dispute. In a complex dispute, there are usually multiple Preparatory Proceedings. The Oral Proceedings are held in open court, either by a single judge or three judges. After the close proceedings, the court renders a judgment on the merits of the case.

===Corporate law===

Japanese Company Law ( ) was separated from the Commercial Code in 2005. Shareholder liability rules generally follow American example. Under Japanese law the basic types of companies are:

*Limited liability partnerships ()
* (K.K.), similar to an American joint-stock company
* (G.K.), similar to an American limited liability company
*, similar to an American general partnership
*, similar to an American limited partnership
*, a now abolished form based on the German GmbH (limited liability company)

Japanese commercial law is also characterized by a relationship with the bureaucracy that is important in determining how those engaged in commerce conduct business.

===Intellectual property law===
===Family law===
===Employment law===
Basics of the Japanese employment law are established in the Japanese Constitution, which was framed in large part with an eye toward the U.S. Constitution. As such, employment laws in Japan are similar to those in the U.S., and can be divided into three general categories: labor standards, labor relations, and trade unions. The &#x27;employment&#x27; or &#x27;service&#x27; contract is recognised under article 623 of the Japanese Civil Code. While the term &quot;labour contract&quot; is not defined under the Labor Standards Act (LSA), to all intents and purposes the courts regard the two as one and the same, and the terms &quot;labour contract&quot; and &quot;employment contract&quot; as interchangeable. It is through the civil procedure, therefore, that the boundaries of the individual contract have largely been defined by means of a comprehensive body of case law.

Most terms and conditions of employment are provided by the company&#x27;s work rules, which may be drawn up and varied unilaterally. However, under the LSA, an employer of more than ten persons is required to draw up a set of rules specifying certain conditions of work, including hours, rates of pay, promotion, retirement and dismissal (LSA s. 89). About 42 per cent of the private sector workforce is employed in firms with fewer than ten employees. Consequently, these employers are exempt from the legal obligation to provide formal work rules in respect of their employees. The LSA also requires the employer to consult with the union, if any, or with a person who represents a majority of the employees in drafting the work rules (LSA s. 89). A copy of the work rules must also be submitted to the Labour Standards Office (LSA s. 90).

Under the Japanese Constitution, citizens are guaranteed the right to maintain the minimum standards of a wholesome and cultured life (s. 25). These are to be maintained through the right to work (s. 27) and the right to property (s. 29). The Constitution also guarantees certain work-related rights. Wages, hours and other working conditions must be fixed by law (s. 27).

Under the Industrial Safety and Health Act of 1972 (ISHA), employers bear the major responsibility for the prevention of occupational disease and accident through an integrated scheme of insurance and safety and health management. Furthermore, through the employment contract, employers owe a general duty to take care of their employees’ health and safety—and may be sued for damages for negligence in cases where breach of duty or violation of the statutory regulations has occurred.

==Criminal law==

===History===

Before the Meiji period (1867–1912), the powers of the Tokugawa shogunate, or the judges they appointed, possessed a large amount of discretion, which often resulted in the abuse of power. Capital punishment was the main measure of dealing with offenders in the criminal justice system. Under feudalism, authorities frequently used the death penalty against political rivals.

After the Meiji Restoration, as Western culture was introduced, the government established new laws reflecting a gradually modernizing Japanese society. The first criminal code after the Restoration was the () of 1869, primarily influenced by the Chinese Ming and Qing codes and the law of the Tokugawa Shogunate. However, new criminal law and prison laws were passed in an effort to bring Japan into line with Western countries. An 1880 criminal code was primarily inspired on French law, while the current code, enacted in 1907 was primarily based on German law.

Based on the new Constitution after World War II, the Criminal Code was radically changed to reflect constitutional rights such as free expression and gender equality. The Criminal Code has since been amended from time to time, and special laws were also enacted to target specific areas of crime.

The Criminal Procedure Code was also drastically amended after World War II, under American legal influence, to guarantee due process and largely adopting an adversarial system. Under this system, the roles of the police, the prosecutor, and the judge changed. The rights of offenders also became a main issue in the criminal justice system in the post-war period. Unfortunately, immediately following this innovation, a series of cases resulted in a miscarriage of justice partly because the police were not accustomed to the new system.

Although a jury system came into force in 1939, it was practically never used because of inflexibility in the ongoing criminal justice system at that time. In addition, professional judges have always enjoyed a high level of trust in Japanese society. After the war, the police began to carry guns instead of sabers, according to the advice of the United States.

Arguments were frequently made for reforming the main laws such as the Criminal Law (1907), the Juvenile Law (1947) and the Prisons Law (1907). However, plans for reform were controversial because they addressed delicate issues, such as the introduction of protective measures to Criminal Law, juvenile punishment, or the abolition of the practice of imprisoning defendants in police cells. Japanese society is relatively conservative in its approach to reforms and is generally inclined to oppose them. The government attempts to reform older laws by issuing a series of supplements. However, both the Code of Criminal Law and the Juvenile Law were revised in 1948 after the manifested new constitution of 1946, following the interruption to reform that World War II presented.

In 1926, a governmental advisory commission drafted forty principles to be included in the revision of the penal code that a few years later were used as the basis of a provisional &quot;Revised Penal Code of Japan&quot;, published in 1941. While this document itself does not remain as the present form of the penal code of Japan it was largely influential to its construction and has informed the judicial interpretation of the modern code.

===Criminal law===
Japanese criminal law is primarily based on the Criminal Code (刑法) of 1907. Other important statutes include the Law on Misdemeanours, the Law on the Prevention of Subversive Activities, the Law on Penalising Hijacking, the Law on the Prohibition of Unlawful Access to Computers, and the Law on the Control of Stalking. The General Part of the Criminal Code expounds principles and concepts, including intention, negligence, attempt, and accomplice, which applies to all criminal laws.

====Classification of crimes====

*Legal classification. The three main categories of crime under the Japanese Criminal Law are crimes against the state, crimes against society and crimes against individuals. This law was passed under the old Constitution which had mainly focused on the power of the emperor and the state. As a result, crimes against the imperial family and the state were highly emphasized. While crimes against the imperial family were abolished after World War II, the fundamental structure of this law was little changed. Since there has been no complete revision of the law, the law remains fairly antiquated on the surface.

The criminal justice system reflects the state&#x27;s task of protecting individual interests in daily life. Crimes against life, person, and freedom include homicide, assault, bodily injury, forcible rape, indecent assault, and kidnapping. Crimes against property include theft, fraud, robbery, extortion, and embezzlement. The concept of theft has a very broad meaning and includes burglary, shoplifting, and stealing the goods in a car. Stealing bicycles from in front of railway stations is a typical theft according to criminal statistics. Crimes which significantly cause social disorder, like arson, indecent behavior in the public, and gambling, are usually placed in a category of crimes against society. Bribery is considered a crime against the state.

*Special laws. Includes firearms and sword control law, laws for regulating business that affects public morals, anti-prostitution laws, anti-organized crime laws, and road traffic laws. There are a large number of traffic offenses, indicating serious problems on roads in Japan. Annually, there are 11,000 deaths caused by traffic accidents. After a controversy involving citizens&#x27; freedom of association in 1992, an anti-organized crime law was passed which regulated the activity of Boryokudan crime organizations.
*Age of criminal liability. Persons younger than 20 years of age are legally considered juveniles. According to the Juvenile Law, juvenile cases go to Family court. The court subsequently determines the need to subject the juvenile concerned to protective measures and the most beneficial treatment for the juvenile. Possible measures include placement under the supervision of probation officers, commitment to a child education or training home or a house for dependent children, and commitment to a juvenile training school. The Juvenile Law states that juvenile cases should be in principle separated from adult cases in terms of their future development. Although there are exceptions, juveniles are criminally prosecuted when the case involves a certain punishment in response to a very serious offense.
*Drug offenses. There are special laws regulating cannabis, narcotics and psychotropics, stimulants and opium. Drug regulations cover punishment for the use, trade, possession, and production of drugs. In the 1990s a new drug regulation was introduced to conform to the standards of the United Nations. Toluene, thinner, and bonding substances are regulated by special law as well. Their abuse is a serious problem among the youth, partly because of their cheap price. Drug abuse in Japanese society largely stems from the use of amphetamine, which is largely imported from other Asian countries. Organized crime is involved in the handling and production of amphetamines and has become rich from this activity.

====Crime statistics====

Police, prosecution, court, correction and after-care divisions each publish their own statistics as a yearbook. The Ministry of Justice summarizes their statistics and publishes a book, White Paper on Crime. Because of the nationwide unitary system of these agencies, such a complete portrayal of the crime situation in Japan is possible.

Japan is widely regarded to have exceptionally low levels of crime. In 2017, for example, its intentional homicide rate was 0.2 per 100,000 people, compared to 5.3 per 100,000 in the United States and 1.2 in the United Kingdom. In 2018, crime fell to a new low since World War II, declining for the 16th consecutive year.

=== Criminal procedure ===
The Code of Criminal Procedure (刑事訴訟法) governs Japanese criminal procedure. Investigation is conducted by police officers and public prosecutors. No one can be apprehended, searched or seized except on the basis of a warrant issued by a competent judicial officer. Warrants for arrests are not needed for in flagrante delicto (現行犯) and serious offenses for which a warrant cannot be obtained in time.

Suspects can be detained for a maximum of seventy-two hours before being brought before a judge to authorize continued detention. Suspects must be informed of their right to remain silent, and counsel will be appointed if they cannot afford one. Suspects can be detained for 10 days prior to indictment, renewable once (Art. 208). After indictment, there is no limit to the length of detention and some defendants spend months awaiting trial. Bail is available only after indictment, although its use is limited.

Prosecutors have broad discretion on whether to prosecute, but a Prosecution Review Board (検察審査会) consisting of randomly selected citizens and the court (through a procedure known as () may review cases and initiate prosecution.

Criminal trials are necessary in Japan regardless of whether the defendant pleads guilty. In a criminal trial where the defendant has admitted guilt, the average time needed to complete the trial is 2.6 months; but contested cases take an average of 8.5 months to complete. Japanese criminal trials are adversarial, with parties taking initiative in producing and examining evidence; parties are in theory allowed to cross-examine witnesses, although trials often rely on documentary testimony rather than live testimony. Judges deliver the verdict and determine sentencing. Both the prosecution and the defense may appeal to a higher court.

==Law enforcement==
The national level police organizations are the National Public Safety Commission and the National Police Agency (NPA). Since the commission makes basic policy while the NPA administers police affairs, the commission has control over the NPA. The commission is a governmental body responsible mainly for the administrative supervision of the police and coordination of police administration. It also oversees matters relating to police education, communication, criminal identification, criminal statistics and police equipment. To ensure its independence and neutrality, not even the Prime Minister is empowered to direct and give orders to the NPSC.

The NPA, which is headed by a Director General, maintains Regional Police Bureaus as its local agencies throughout the country. There are seven bureaus in the major cities, excluding Tokyo and the northern island of Hokkaido. Police law stipulates that each prefectural government, which is a local entity, shall have its own Prefectural Police (PP). The PP is supervised by the Prefectural Public Safety Commission, which carries out all police duties within the boundaries of the prefecture. In practice, the PP forces are located in each of the 47 prefectures. The National Police Academy, the National Research Institute of Police Science and the Imperial Guard Headquarters are also organizations affiliated with the NPA. In addition, the Koban system provides local residents with safety and peace through daily contacts of police officers with residents in the area. Originally created by the Japanese police, this system has been recently adopted by countries such as Germany and Singapore. However, its success depends on the human relationship between the police officers and the community people. At times, there is an excess of intervention by police. The Koban system rests on approximately 15,000 police boxes (Hasshusho) and residential police boxes (Chuzaisho) located throughout the country.

===Resources===

*Expenditures. There are two types of police budgets: the national budget and the prefectural budget. The national police budget covers the expenditures of the NPA relevant to the execution of duties under its jurisdiction, including personnel costs, expenses incurred by the prefectural police which are shouldered by the state, and subsidies to the PP. Expenditures needed by the PP to carry out their duties are appropriated in the budget of each prefecture. In 1992, the NPA budget totalled 213,464 billion yen and the PP budget totalled 2,992,454 million yen (US$270 billion).

The total National Police Agency Budget for the 1990 fiscal year was 198,420 billion yen, of which 41.5% (82,282 billion yen) went toward personnel expenses, 14.5% (28,870 billion yen) went toward equipment, communications, and facilities, 18.2% (36,149 billion yen) were allocated toward other expenses, and 25.8% (51,119 billion yen) went toward subsidies for Prefectural Police. In all, 74.2% of the total (147,301 billion yen) went toward NPA expenses.

*Number of police. The NPA and the PP personnel forces are composed of police officers, officers of the Imperial Guard Headquarters, and civilian employees such as clerical workers and technical engineers. In 1990, there were about 258,800 authorized full-time police personnel. The ratio of police to population is about one officer to 556 citizens. The NPA is composed of approximately 7,600 personnel, of whom 1,200 are police officers, 900 are Imperial Guards and 5,500 are civilian personnel. The 47 PP forces have a total strength of approximately 250,000, of whom 220,000 are police officers and 30,000 are civilians. There are approximately 4,200 female police officers (1.6%), whose role has been growing in importance. In addition, there are about 14,000 female civilians, of whom about 3,100 are traffic control personnel and juvenile guidance personnel engaged in on-the-street juvenile control.

===Technology===

*Availability of police automobiles. Motor vehicles are assigned to all police boxes throughout the country. Because of their mobility, they are useful in handling emergency cases, investigating criminal activity, and enforcing traffic control. As of 1994, there are approximately 26,000 police motor vehicles, including 5,000 patrol cars, 3,000 traffic police motorcycles, 5,000 vehicles employed for criminal investigation and 2,500 transport vehicles. In addition, about 200 police boats and 60 helicopters are assigned to each jurisdiction.
*Electronic equipment. Network technology includes police telephone circuits, facsimile, an integrated system for police activities, a communication command system and mobile radio system, portable radio sets, a communication satellite, and multi-channel mobile telephone cars.
*Weapons. After World War II, the United States advised Japanese police to require individual police officers to carry guns, whereas they used to carry only sabers. However, few guns are actually used. One problem is that offenders may initially attack police in order to obtain guns.

===Training and qualifications===

Recruited police officers must immediately attend a three-part training course, consisting of preservice, on-the-job, and a comprehensive training course. Those recruited by the PP are enrolled in a 1-year preservice training course at their respective police academies.

===Discretion===

*Confessions. Admissions of testimony in court may not include confessions made under compulsion, torture or threat, or after prolonged detention or confinement. Conviction or punishment cannot be permitted where the only proof against the defendant is his or her own confession.

==Legal professions==

Japan recognizes a large number of legal professions, however the number of lawyers is significantly fewer than in the United States. This is due to the fact that Japanese law is based on the Continental European civil law system and a very small number of lawyers (advocates) are complemented by large numbers of civil law notaries and scriveners. Japan introduced a new legal training system in 2004 as part of a justice system reform. The justice system reform has been criticized for failing to incorporate a gender perspective. The major professions, each of which has a separate qualification process, include:
*
*
*
*
*

In-house legal advisors at major corporations are almost entirely unregulated, although there has been a trend in the past decade towards attorneys moving in-house.
==Courts and procedure==
Japan&#x27;s court system is divided into four basic tiers, 438 Summary Courts, one District Court in each prefecture, eight High Courts and the Supreme Court. There is also one Family Court tied to each District Court.

===Rights of the accused===

*Rights of the accused. The Constitution is the source of individual rights in the setting of criminal investigations and trial. Article 31 declares, &quot;No person shall be deprived of life or liberty, nor shall any other penalty be imposed, except according to procedure established by law&quot;, which is regarded as the principle of due process. Article 33 covers protection from illegal arrest: &quot;no person shall be arrested except upon a warrant issued by a competent judicial official, which specifies the offense with which a person is charged&quot;. Article 34 protects persons from illegal confinement and Article 35 protects persons from illegal deprivation of residence and property.

Provisions directly governing trial proceedings provide that admissions of testimony must be compelling. There are also rights guaranteeing a speedy and public trial, full opportunity to examine all witnesses, and legal counsel by lawyers employed by the state if the accused cannot afford a private lawyer. In addition, a person cannot incur criminal liability if the act was lawful at the time it was committed, and cannot be subject to conviction for the same crime twice (double jeopardy).

*Assistance to the accused. The state must provide legal counsel if the defendant cannot afford a private lawyer.

===Procedures===

*Preparatory procedures for bringing a suspect to trial. Procedure in criminal prosecutions is uniform throughout Japan, and based primarily on the 1948 Code of Criminal Procedure and the 1949 Rules of Criminal Procedure under the Constitutional Law, reflecting Anglo-American legal concepts in contexts important to the protection of human rights. When police investigation is completed, police must refer the matter, including the evidentiary data, immediately to a public prosecutor. If the matter involves confining a suspect, they must refer the case to the public prosecutor within 48 hours of the suspect&#x27;s arrest after which a determination is made concerning pre-trial detention.

The jury system has, for all practical purposes, been suspended. There are no procedures equivalent to a guilty plea. That is, even if the defendant acknowledges guilt, the prosecutor must submit evidence to establish guilt. Further, since the Japanese procedural system does not include pre-sentence investigations and reports by probation officers, evidentiary data bearing on the sentencing must be presented by the parties to the case, to be supplemented by the court&#x27;s own inquiries. In this context, the court is the exclusive trier of fact, which consists of the physical evidence and, when that is the case, the confession of the accused as well as any witnesses testimony.

*Official who conducts prosecution. Only prosecutors are empowered to institute the prosecution of a criminal case and to direct the enforcement of criminal sentences. They have a large amount of discretion in controlling and directing criminal cases. (Japanese Criminal Procedure Code, Art.248). Accordingly, they have the power to suspend prosecution even when they can prove the offender committed a crime. They can also investigate all categories of criminal cases on their own initiative, without assistance from the police and other law enforcement agencies. Special cases, such as bribery involving highly placed government officials or corporate crimes involving a breach of trust by executives are often investigated by prosecutors. The increasing frequency of the occurrence of these special cases have emphasized the importance of the prosecutor&#x27;s investigative powers.

Under the Supreme Public Prosecution Office are 8 higher offices, 50 district offices and 810 local offices. As of 1990, there were about 1,100 prosecutors and 900 assistant public officers, who are all appointed by the central government.

*Proportion of prosecuted cases going to trial. Japan has a low rate of acquittals and a high rate of convictions. In 1988, there were 57,790 accused persons tried in first-instance courts, of which only 50 (0.01%) were found not guilty. Defense lawyers generally prefer the introduction of mitigating circumstantial evidence rather than arguing with the prosecutor. In addition, both practicing lawyers and judges regard criminal cases as being less attractive than other types of cases.
*Pre-trial incarceration conditions. If the public prosecutor believes that continued detention of the accused is needed, he or she must apply to a judge for a warrant of detention. This warrant must be applied for within 24 hours after police transfer to the prosecutor, or a maximum of 72 hours from the time of arrest.

If reasonable grounds to detain a suspect exist, the judge must promptly issue a warrant or order of detention at a maximum of 10 days before prosecution is instituted. Reasonable grounds are determined by three criteria: 1) whether the suspect has a fixed dwelling, 2) whether the suspect might destroy evidence and; 3) whether he might flee the jurisdiction.

<text>The Tuvans (from Russian ) or Tyvans (from Tuvan ) are a Turkic ethnic group indigenous to Siberia that live in Tuva, Mongolia, and China. They speak the Tuvan language, a Siberian Turkic language. In Mongolia, they are regarded as one of the Uriankhai peoples.

Tuvans have historically been livestock-herding nomads, tending to herds of goats, sheep, camels, reindeer, cattle, and yaks for the past thousands of years. (This is, in fact, evident in the Tuvan folk song &quot;Tooruktug Dolgai Tangdym&quot;.) They have traditionally lived in yurts covered by felt or chums, layered with birch bark or hide that they relocate seasonally as they move to newer pastures. Traditionally, the Tuvans were divided into nine regions called &quot;khoshuun&quot;, namely the Tozhu, Salchak, Oyunnar, Khemchik, Khaasuut, Shalyk, Nibazy, Daavan and Choodu, and Beezi. The first four were ruled by Uriankhai Mongol princes, while the rest were administered by Borjigin Mongol princes.

== History ==

Besides prehistoric rock-carvings to be found especially along the Yenisei banks, the first internationally important archaeological findings have been near Arzhan, in the north central Tuva. Here, Scythian kurgan burials are being researched, revealing the earliest (7th, 6th century BC) and easternmost remains of these people who spread from Central Asia and predate Turcomongol tribes. Their story and artifacts can be viewed in the National Museum in Kyzyl.

The Xiongnu ruled over the area of Tuva prior to 200 AD. At this time, a people known to the Chinese as Dingling 丁零 inhabited the region. Chinese chroniclers further associated the Dingling with the Tiele, one of whose tribes was named Dubo (都波) and was located in the eastern Sayans. The word &quot;tuwa&quot; also occurs three times in the Inscription of Hüis Tolgoi. While it is not clear what it means, Dieter Maue suggested that it could be related to the tribal name &quot;Dubo&quot;. This name is recognized as being associated with the Tuvan people and is the earliest written record of them. The Xianbei 鮮卑 (descendants of the Donghu 東胡, once conquered by the Xiongnu) attacked and defeated the Xiongnu and they, in turn, were defeated by the Rouran 柔然. From around the end of the 6th century, the Göktürks held dominion over Tuvans (&quot;Doubo&quot; 都播), who constituted one of the three Wooden-Horse Turkic tribes, up until the 8th century when the Uyghurs took over.
Tuvans were subjects of the Uyghur Khanate during the 8th and 9th centuries. The Uyghurs established several fortifications within Tuva as a means of subduing the population. There are plans being discussed to restore the remains of one of these fortresses, Por-Bazhyn in lake Tere-Khol in the southeast of the country. The memory of Uyghur occupation could still be seen up until the end of the 19th century due to the application of the name &quot;Ondar Uyghur&quot; for the Ondar Tuvans living near the Khemchik river in the southwest. Uyghur dominance was broken by the Yeniseian Kyrgyz in 840 AD, who came from the upper reaches of the Yenisei.

In 1207, the Oirat prince Quduqa-Beki led Mongol detachments under Jochi to a tributary of the Kaa-Khem river. They encountered the Tuvan Keshdims, Baits, and Teleks. This was the beginning of Mongol suzerainty over the Tuvans. After the collapse of the Naiman Khanate, Tuvans moved to modern Mongolia and some Naimans moved to modern Kazakhstan territory.

Tuvans came to be ruled for most of the 17th century by Khalka Mongol leader Sholoi Ubashi Altan-Khan. It was at this time in 1615 that the first Russians, Vasily Tyumenets and Ivan Petrov, visited Tuva as emissaries to the Altan-Khan. Russian documents from this time record information about different groups that contributed to the composition of modern Tuvans. Tyumenets and Petrov describe the Maads, who became Russian subjects in 1609, living in the Bii-Khem basin, 14 days&#x27; ride from Tomsk. The Maads travelled to the area of the Khemchik and Ulug-Khem next to the lands of the Altan-Khan near the lake Uvs Nuur. The ambassadors also described the Sayan raising reindeer with the Tochi (Todzhi) from the Sayan to the Altai mountain ranges. The descendants of the Ak-Sayan and Kara-Sayan live mostly around Tere-Khol rayon.

The Altan-Khan&#x27;s control over the area lessened over time due to constant warring between the Oirat and the Khalka of Jasaghtu Khan aimag. The Tuvans then became part of the Dzungarian Empire ruled by the Oirats. The Dzungars ruled over all of the Sayano-Altay Plateau until 1755. It was during this time of Dzungarian rule that many tribes and clans broke up, moved around, and intermingled. Groups of Altayan Telengits settled in western Tuva on the Khemchik and Barlyk rivers and in the region of Bai-Taiga. Some Todzhans, Sayans, and Mingats ended up in the Altay. The Siberians (Xianbei) established Manchu-Qing Dynasty migrated other Tuvans north across the Sayan range and they became known as Beltirs (Dag-Kakpyn, Sug-Kakpyn, Ak-Chystar, Kara-Chystar). The languages of the Beltirs and Tuvans still contain common words not found in the language of the other Khakas (Kachins or Sagays). Other Russian documents mention Yeniseian Kyrgyz (Saryglar and Kyrgyz), Orchaks (Oorzhaks) and Kuchugets (Kuzhugets) moving into Tuva from the north.

Genetic research revealed that Tuvans are most closely related to other Turkic peoples, specifically the Altaians and the Khakas. It was found that Tuvans display differences to Mongolic peoples and are closer related to Siberian Turkic groups. Tuvans seem to be the direct descendants of the Indigenous Southern Siberian peoples.

According to Ilya Zakharov of Moscow&#x27;s Vavilov Institute of General Genetics, genetic evidence suggests that the Tuvan people are among the close genetic relatives to the indigenous peoples of the Americas in Eurasia.

=== The name &quot;Uriankhai&quot; ===

There does not seem to exist a clear ethnic delineation for the application of the name &quot;Uriankhai&quot;. Mongols applied this name to all tribes of &quot;Forest People&quot;. This name has historically been applied to Tuvans. In Mongolia there are peoples also known by this name. A variation of the name, &quot;Uraŋxai&quot;, was an old name for the Sakha. Russian Pavel Nebol&#x27;sin documented the &quot;Urankhu&quot; clan of Volga Kalmyks in the 1850s. Another variant of the name, &quot;Orangkae&quot; (오랑캐), was traditionally used by the Koreans to refer indiscriminately to &quot;barbarians&quot; that inhabited the lands to their north.

They are two groups under the name Uriankhai: Mongol Uriankhai, Uriankhai (Tuva) of mixed Turkic-Mongol origin. All clans of the Mongol Uriankhai are Mongol, and Tuva Uriankhais have both Turkic and Mongol clans. In the beginning of the Mongol Empire (1206–1368), the Mongol Uriankhai (Burkhan Khaldun Uriankhai) were located in central Mongolia but in the mid 14th century they lived in Liaoyang province of modern China. In 1375, Naghachu, Uriankhai leader of the Mongolia-based colonial dynasty in Liaoyang province invaded Liaodong with aims of restoring the Mongols to power. Although he continued to hold southern Manchuria, Naghachu finally surrendered to the Chinese Ming dynasty in 1387–88 after successful diplomacy of the latter. After the rebellion of the northern Uriankhai people, they were conquered by Dayan Khan in 1538 and mostly annexed by the northern Khalkha. Batmunkh Dayan Khan dissolved Uriankhai tumen and moved them to Altai Mountains and Khalkha land.

Currently, Tuvans form the majority of the population in Tuva Republic. According to the 2010 Russian census, there was a total of 249,299 Tuvans who resided within Tuva. This represented 82.0% of the total population of the republic. In addition, Tuvans have a much higher fertility rate than Russians and the other Slavic peoples, while the median age of the Tuvan population is much lower than Russians. This basically ensures that the Tuvan population would continue to grow during the foreseeable future.

In the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine since 2022, the Tuvans have been reported as one of Russia&#x27;s ethnic minority groups suffering from a disproportionally large casualty rate among Russian forces.

== Geography ==

There are two major groups of Tuvans in Tuva: Western or the Common Tuvans and Tuvans-Todzhins (Тувинцы-тоджинцы). The latter ones live in Todzhinsky District, Tuva Republic and constitute about 5% of all Tuvans.

A people similar by language to Tuvans live in Okinsky District of Buryatia (autonym: Soyots (сойоты), sometimes referred to as Oka Tuvans).

=== Mongolia ===
A noticeable proportion of Tuvans lives in Mongolia. The Dukha live in Khövsgöl Aimag. The largest population of Tuvans in Mongolia are the &quot;Tsengel Tuvans&quot;. Around 1,500 live in the Tsagaan Gol River Valley, Altai Tavan Bogd National Park, Tsengel Sum of Bayan-Ölgii Aimag. Other Tuvans live in Khovd Aimag and in Ubsunur Hollow.

=== China ===
Tuvans in China, who live mostly in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, are included under the Mongol ethnicity. Some Tuvans reportedly live at Lake Kanas in the northwestern part of Xinjiang in China where they are not officially recognized, are counted as a part of the local Oirat Mongol community that is counted under the general label &quot;Mongol&quot;. Oirat and Tuvan children attend schools in which they use Chakhar Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.

== Culture ==

=== Headdress ===
The famous bogtag headdress worn by women seems to have been restricted to married women of very high rank.

=== Traditional life ===
The Tuvans were mainly semi-nomadic livestock herders. They raised sheep, goats, camels, horses, reindeer, cattle, and yaks. Today, some Tuvans still retain their semi-nomadic way of life. The mobile dwellings of the Tuvans were usually circular yurts used in the steppes or conical hide tents when they were near or inside a forest.

=== Language ===
The Tuvan language belongs to the Northern or Siberian branch of the Turkic language family. Four dialects are recognized: Central, Western, Southeastern and Northeastern (Todzhinian). In writing, a variety of the Cyrillic script is used. A talking dictionary is produced by Living Tongues Institute.

=== Religion ===
The traditional religion of Tuvans is a type of Tengriism, or Turkic animistic shamanism. During the 18th century, the Tuvans converted to Tibetan Buddhism via contact with the Mongolians. However, many shamanistic elements continued to be widely practiced along with the new religion the Tuvans adopted.

=== Music ===

A unique form of music exists in Tuva – commonly known as throat singing or as khoomei. There are various techniques of khoomei, some giving the effect of multiple tones by emphasizing overtones. Some famous groups from Tuva who feature throat-singing are Yat-Kha, Huun-Huur-Tu, Chirgilchin and the Alash Ensemble.

A documentary called &quot;Genghis Blues&quot; was made in 1999 about an American blues/jazz musician, Paul Pena, who taught himself overtone singing and traveled to Tuva to compete in a throat-singing competition. This is where he also met the famous Khoomeizhi Kongar-ol Ondar one of the masters of Khoomei.

=== Skiing ===
The Tuvan people have been skiing for thousands of years, primarily for the purpose of hunting elk. Tuvan hunters would track an elk in a heavy snow region and once they spotted an elk, they would ski downhill fast and throw a lasso to catch their game. Although the origin of skiing is hotly debated, some experts believe that the Tuvan people in the Altay mountains may have been the earliest humans to master skiing for the purpose of hunting, due to ancient cave paintings in the region depicting ancient skiers chasing big game. However, nowadays in the same region within Xinjiang, the hunting of animals has been banned by the Chinese government, who had made the entire mountain into a conservation area. But the Tuvan people still actively and legally engage in &quot;catch-and-release&quot; hunting of elk using their traditional methods.

<text>Carlo Saraceni (1579 – 16 June 1620) was an Italian early-Baroque painter, whose reputation as a &quot;first-class painter of the second rank&quot; was improved with the publication of a modern monograph in 1968.

==Life==
Though he was born and died in Venice, his paintings are distinctly Roman in style; he moved to Rome in 1598, joining the Accademia di San Luca in 1607. He never visited France, though he spoke fluent French and had French followers and a French wardrobe. His painting, however, was influenced at first by the densely forested, luxuriantly enveloping landscape settings for human figures of Adam Elsheimer, a German painter resident in Rome; &quot;there are few landscapes by Saraceni which have not been attributed to Elsheimer,&quot; Malcolm Waddingham observed, and Anna Ottani Cavina has suggested the influences may have travelled both ways. and Elsheimer&#x27;s small cabinet paintings on copper offered a format that Saraceni employed in six landscape panels illustrating &quot;The Flight of Icarus&quot;; in &quot;Moses and the Daughters of Jethro,&quot; and &quot;Mars and Venus&quot;.

When Caravaggio&#x27;s notorious &quot;Death of the Virgin&quot; was rejected in 1606 as an altarpiece suitable for a chapel of Santa Maria della Scala, it was Saraceni who provided the acceptable substitute, which remains &quot;in situ&quot;, the only securely dated painting of his first decade in Rome. He was influenced by Caravaggio&#x27;s dramatic lighting, monumental figures, naturalistic detail, and momentary action, so that he is numbered among the first of the &quot;tenebrists&quot; or &quot;Caravaggisti&quot;. Examples of this style can be seen in the candlelit &quot;Judith with the Head of Holofernes&quot;.

Saraceni&#x27;s style matured rapidly between 1606 and 1610, and the next decade gave way to his fully mature works, synthesizing Caravaggio and the Venetians. In 1616–17 he collaborated on the frescoes for the &quot;Sala Regia&quot; of the Palazzo del Quirinale. In 1618 he received payment for two paintings in the church of Santa Maria dell&#x27;Anima. The compositional details of his fresco of &quot;The Birth of the Virgin&quot; in the Chapel of the Annunciation of the church of Santa Maria in Aquiro are repeated in a panel on copper at the Louvre.

In 1620 he returned to Venice, where he died in the same year.

<text>The Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) was a military decoration awarded until 1993 to personnel of the British Armed Forces, and formerly to personnel of other Commonwealth of Nations, up to the enlisted grade of OR-6, for bravery and resourcefulness on active service.

==History==
The medal was established on 14 October 1914 as the third level decoration for gallantry in action for ratings of the Royal Navy, not at the standard required to receive the Victoria Cross or the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal. The equivalent decoration for Officers and Warrant Officers was the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). The DSM ranked below the DSC in order of precedence, between the George Medal and the Military Medal after those medals were established in 1940 and 1916 respectively. Awards of the DSM were announced in the London Gazette. Recipients are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;DSM&quot;.

The DSM was intended to reward bravery at sea. For example, members of the Royal Naval Division, who served alongside the Army in France in the First World War, were eligible for Army decorations, including the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Military Medal.

From 1916, ribbon bars could be authorised for subsequent awards of the DSM.

In 1940 the award was extended to Royal Air Force personnel serving with the Fleet and, in 1942, to members of the Merchant Navy, and Army personnel serving afloat, for example manning a merchant ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns. A number of awards were also made to civilians, including two for ferrying troops from the beaches during the 1940 Dunkirk evacuation.

In 1979 eligibility for a number of awards, including the DSM, was extended to permit posthumous awards. Until that time, only the Victoria Cross and a mention in dispatches could be awarded posthumously.

The Distinguished Service Medal was discontinued in 1993, as part of the review of the British honours system which recommended removing distinctions of rank in respect of awards for bravery. Since then the Distinguished Service Cross, previously only open to Commissioned and Warrant Officers, has been awarded to all ranks.

The DSM had also been awarded by Commonwealth countries but by the 1990s most, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, were establishing their own honours systems and no longer recommended British honours.

==Description==
* The DSM is a circular silver medal, in diameter, with the following design:
* The obverse bears the effigy and titles of the reigning monarch.
* The reverse has the inscription &#x27;FOR DISTINGUISHED SERVICE&#x27; on three lines, within a laurel wreath surmounted by an Imperial crown.
* The suspender is plain and straight.
* The name, rank, service number and ship of the recipient are engraved or impressed on the rim of the medal.
* The ribbon is 32 millimetres (1.25 inches) wide and consists of three equal stripes: dark blue, white, and dark blue, with a thin dark blue stripe down the centre of the white.
* Ribbon bars, indicating a further award, are silver and ornamented with laurel leaves. Bars issued during the First World War were dated on the reverse, while those awarded during the Second World War were undated. When the ribbon alone is worn, a silver rosette denotes the award of each bar.

===Obverse variations===
The medal was awarded with one of five obverse designs:

==Numbers of awards==
Between 1914 and 1993, approximately 11,311 medals and 227 bars were awarded. 

These figures include:
* 51 awards to the Army and 23 to the RAF during the Second World War;
* honorary awards made to servicemen from allied countries during both World Wars.

<text>Artemisia () is a large, diverse genus of plants belonging to the daisy family, Asteraceae, with almost 500 species. Common names for various species in the genus include mugwort, wormwood, and sagebrush.

Some botanists split the genus into several genera, but DNA analysis does not support the maintenance of the genera &quot;Crossostephium&quot;, &quot;Filifolium&quot;, &quot;Neopallasia&quot;, &quot;Seriphidium&quot;, and &quot;Sphaeromeria&quot;; three other segregate genera—&quot;Stilnolepis&quot;, &quot;Elachanthemum&quot;, and &quot;Kaschgaria&quot;—are maintained by this evidence. Occasionally, some of the species are called sages, causing confusion with the &quot;Salvia&quot; sages in the family Lamiaceae.

&quot;Artemisia&quot; comprises hardy herbaceous plants and shrubs, which are known for the powerful chemical constituents in their essential oils. &quot;Artemisia&quot; species grow in temperate climates of both hemispheres, usually in dry or semiarid habitats. Notable species include &quot;A. vulgaris&quot; (common mugwort), &quot;A. tridentata&quot; (big sagebrush), &quot;A. annua&quot; (sagewort), &quot;A. absinthium&quot; (wormwood), &quot;A. dracunculus&quot; (tarragon), and &quot;A. abrotanum&quot; (southernwood). The leaves of many species are covered with white hairs.

Most species have strong aromas and bitter tastes from terpenoids and sesquiterpene lactones, which discourage herbivory, and may have had a selective advantage. The small flowers are wind-pollinated. &quot;Artemisia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. The name &quot;Artemisia&quot; derives from the Greek goddess Artemis (Roman Diana), the namesake of Greek Queens Artemisia I and II. A more specific reference may be to Artemisia II of Caria, a botanist and medical researcher (also a queen and naval commander), who died in 350 BCE.

=== Classification ===
Classification of &quot;Artemisia&quot; is difficult. Divisions of &quot;Artemisia&quot; prior to 2000 into subgenera or sections have not been backed up by molecular data, but much of the molecular data, as of 2006, are not especially strong. The following identified groups do not include all the species in the genus.

====Subgenera &quot;Artemisia&quot; and &quot;Absinthium&quot;====

Subgenera &quot;Artemisia&quot; and &quot;Absinthium&quot; are sometimes, but not always, considered the same. Subgenus &quot;Artemisia&quot; (originally &quot;Abrotanum&quot; Besser) is characterized by a heterogamous flower head with female outer florets and hermaphrodite central florets, and a fertile, glabrous receptacle. &quot;Absinthium&quot; DC, though sometimes merged with subgenus &quot;Artemisia&quot; is characterized by heterogamous flower head with female outer florets and hermaphrodite central florets, and a fertile, hairy receptacle. Generally, previously proposed monotypic and non-monophyletic subgenera have been merged with the subgenus &quot;Artemesia&quot; due to molecular evidence. For example, in 2011 using ribosomal DNA analysis of their own and a review of molecular data (such as ITS sequence analysis) of others, S. Garcia and colleagues argued that it was logical to rename several &quot;Sphaeromeria&quot; and &quot;Picrothamnus&quot; (formerly designated sister genera to &quot;Artemisia&quot;) species as &quot;Artemisia&quot;, as well as to revert some &quot;Sphaeromeria&quot; species back to &quot;Artemisia&quot;, where they had been categorized previously. Part of this was due to research by Watson and colleagues, who found that the four subgenera were not monophyletic except for &quot;Dracunculus,&quot; after analyzing and matching the internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA from many &quot;Seriphidium&quot; and &quot;Artemisia&quot; species, and the related genera &quot;Arctanthemum&quot; and &quot;Dendranthema&quot;. The authors concluded that inflorescence morphology is not alone reliable for categorizing the genus or some subgenera, as qualities that previously demarcated them (such as homogamous, discoid, ray-less inflorescences) seemed to have undergone paralleled evolution up to seven times. &quot;Picrothamnus&quot; Nutt. (&quot;bud sage&quot;), now considered &quot;Artemisia spinescens&quot; and &quot;Sphaeromeria&quot; Nutt. (&quot;chicken sage&quot;) are some examples, both endemic to North America.

==== &quot;Tridentatae&quot; ====
Section &quot;Tridentatae&quot; consists of eleven to thirteen species of coarse shrubs often known colloquially as &quot;sagebrushes&quot;, which are very prominent parts of the flora in western North America. In some classifications, they have previously been considered part of the genus or subgenus &quot;Seriphidium&quot;, although recent studies have contested this lineage to Old World species. &quot;Tridentatae&quot; was first articulated as a section by Rydberg in 1916, and it was not until McArthur et al. in 1981 that &quot;Tridentatae&quot; was elevated to a separate subgenus from &quot;Seriphidium&quot;. The principal motive for their separation was geographical distribution, chemical makeup, and karyotype. Much of the debate surrounding Tridentatae is phytogeographic, thus habitat and geography are frequently cited when understanding the evolution of this endemic North American subgenus. Evolutionary cycles of wet and dry climates encouraged &quot;diploid and polyploid races which are morphologically similar if not indistinguishable&quot; (McArthur 598).

Autopolyploidy among plants is not uncommon, however &quot;Tridentatae&quot; exhibits a remarkable amount of chromosomal differences at the population level, rather than the taxon level. This contributes to the difficulty in determining &quot;Tridentatae&#x27;s&quot; phylogeny. The subgenus&#x27; relative homogeneity within ploidies has enabled it to habitually hybridize and backcross, resulting in a high degree of genetic variation at the population level rather than the taxon level. For instance, some articles suggest that to be monophyletic, section &quot;Tridentatae&quot; should exclude &quot;Artemisia bigelovii&quot; and &quot;A. palmeri&quot;. and include &quot;A. pygmaea&quot; and &quot;A. rigida&quot;. These results were supported by extensive chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and nrDNA sequencing which departed from prior morphological, anatomical, and behavioral data.

Traditional lineages within &quot;Tridentatae&quot; were proposed on the basis of leaf morphology, habitat preference, and the ability to leaf-sprout, among other morphological and behavioral characteristics. For instance, sagebrush in the &quot;A. tridentata&quot; lineage have tridentate leaves, live in especially arid habitats, and are unable to root-sprout. This method of delimitation is problematic for species that do not fully adhere to the characteristics of a given lineage. The dry habitat and the presence of interxylary cork has often made the case for &quot;Tridentatae&quot; as a subgenus of its own, and there is some ribosomal molecular evidence of a &quot;&quot;Tridentatae&quot; core&quot; group for the subgenus. In 2011, Garcia and colleagues proposed enlarging &quot;Tridentatae&quot; and organized it into the sections &quot;Tridentatae&quot;, &quot;Nebulosae&quot;, and &quot;Filifoliae&quot; based on previous research establishing relationships via ribosomal and nuclear DNA.

Intergrading forms are particularly common in recently radiated subgenera such as &quot;Tridentatae&quot;, given their frequent reversals and convergent evolution. Global reviews of &quot;Artemisia&quot; using ITS analysis support the hypothesis that &quot;Tridentatae&quot; has independent origins from Old World &quot;Seriphidium&quot; These findings were compared with capitula morphology, challenging past assumptions based on floral characteristics. To better understand the rapid diversification and radiation relative to Old World &quot;Artemisia&quot;, a closer study of Beriginian or Arctic species may provide missing links.

Section &quot;Tridentatae&quot; includes above species with the exception of &quot;A. longiloba&quot;, which is treated as a subspecies of &quot;A. arbuscula&quot;. Section &quot;Nebulae&quot; includes &quot;A. californica&quot;, &quot;A. nesiotica&quot;, and &quot;A. filifolia&quot;.

====&quot;Seriphidium&quot; ====
The Old World species which different classifications put into the genus or subgenus &quot;Seriphidium&quot; consist of about 125 species native to Europe and temperate Asia, with the largest number of species in Central Asia. Some classifications, such as that of the Flora of North America, exclude any New World plants from &quot;Seriphidium&quot;. They are herbaceous plants or small shrubs.

&quot;Seriphidium&quot; Besser was morphologically categorized by a homogamous flower head with all hermaphrodite florets and fertile and glabrous receptacle. &quot;Tridentatae&quot; was originally categorized as within &quot;Seriphidium&quot; due to floral, inflorescence, and leaf morphological similarities, until McArthur et al.&#x27;s analysis in 1981, which explained these similarities as convergent evolution. Old World &quot;Seriphidium&quot;, with 125 species native to Europe and temperate Asia, was a previous classification of &quot;Seriphidium&quot;. North American or &quot;New World&quot; &quot;Seriphidium&quot; and Old World &quot;Seriphidium&quot;. North American &quot;Seriphidium&quot; were later placed into &quot;Tridentatae&quot; Rydb due to geographical distribution, growth habit, and karyotypic and chemotaxonomic similarities (such as presence of certain terpenols).

==== Subgenus &quot;Dracunculus&quot; ====
One group which is well-supported by molecular data is subgenus &quot;Dracunculus&quot;. It consists of 80 species found in both North America and Eurasia, of which the best-known is perhaps &quot;Artemisia dracunculus&quot;, the spice tarragon.

&quot;Dracunculus&quot; Besser. has historically been characterized morphologically by a heterogamous flower head with female outer florets and hermaphrodite central florets, but with a female-sterile, glabrous receptacle. &quot;Dracunculus&quot; is the most supported and resolved subgenus of &quot;Artemisia&quot;, which includes &quot;Artemisia&quot; &quot;dracunculus&quot; L., known as the cooking spice tarragon. Chloroplast and ribosomal DNA sequence analysis in 2011 supported monophyly with two clades, one of which includes some North American endemic species as well as most species of Europe and Asia, while the second clade includes just &quot;A. salsoloides&quot; and &quot;A. tanaitica&quot;, found in Eastern Europe and Siberia to the Western Himalayas. This study places &quot;Dracunculus&quot; as one of the more recent subgenera within Artemisia, situating &quot;A. salisoides&quot; more basally on the tree, with North American endemic groups such as the sagebrushes having derived on the other end of a split from a common ancestor with &quot;Dracunculus&quot;. Formerly proposed genera &quot;Mausolea&quot;, &quot;Neopallasia&quot; and &quot;Turaniphytum&quot; are now argued to be within the subgenus &quot;Dracunculus&quot; due to ribosomal and chloroplast DNA evidence, with further species resolved as sister groups to &quot;Dracunculus&quot; due to phytochemical relationships.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Artemisia&quot; species are found on every continent except Antarctica, and have become part of many ecosystems around the world as a result. Below is currently a partial view of the importance of &quot;Artemisia&quot; species in ecosystems around the world.

===North America===

In North America, several species of &quot;Artemisia&quot; have become important parts of local environments, with wide adaptability. &quot;Artemisia papposa&quot; described by S.F.Blake &amp; Arthur Cronquist can grow in the harsh, dry expanses of alkali flats, but also adapts to meadowlands.

Sagebrushes like &quot;A. papposa&quot; (of the &quot;Tridenteae&quot; subgenus) in general are found in the north and southwest areas of the North American continent. In the Intermountain West, in a habitat known as Sagebrush Steppe, &quot;A. tridentata&quot;, &quot;A. tripartite&quot;, and &quot;A. arbuscula&quot; grow alongside various grasses and species of bitter bush, creating an important environment for mule deer, pygmy rabbits, antelopes, and the sage grouse. Understanding the phylogenetic relationships among the sagebrushes has been helpful in understanding the relationships among these plants and their environments, as well as learning more about how these plants formed these communities over long stretches of time. Sagebrushes, which include &quot;A.&quot; &quot;ludoviciana&quot; and &quot;A. Tridentata&quot; among others, can often also be found growing near junipers, particularly in the Elkhorn Mountain region, where the Juniper Woodlands form an ecosystem which provide cover for many animal species in both summer and winter months and storms. Because the habitat should burn only every 400–600 years, with sagebrush shrubs living as long as 200 years (though potentially typically 88), this particular combination of &quot;Artemisia&quot; with other flora form an enduring habitat. As it often goes, however, governments and farming businesses have often cleared sagebrush-juniper communities to create land for cow and domestic animal feedcrops, and Artemisia species may be declining due to this and invasive species such as cheatgrass. Destabilization of the vegetation creates higher risk of fires, causing concern among the local conservation and wildlife groups.

Due to their often extensive rhizome systems and other potential characteristics, however, some Artemisia species are often resilient to mowing or pulling, giving some species of Artemisia the ability to easily become invasive if introduced to comfortable, though non-native habitats.
*&quot;A. annua&quot; (native to Eurasia) is found in wetland habitats, and though it has been naturalized in much of North America it is considered weedy or invasive by some localities, such as Kentucky.
*This is particularly true of &quot;Artemisia vulgaris&quot;, known as &quot;common mugwort&quot;, in North America, where it was introduced by European colonists and settlers in the 1600s, when Jesuit priests and other colonizers may have first brought the herb for ointments and teas and likely also let into port cities via ballast dumping. A&quot;rtemisia vulgaris&quot; will grow in dense groups and out-compete other plants in an area, in part due to its ability to grow on poorly enriched soils. Disturbed habitats, cities and roadsides or parking lots can easily become a field of &quot;A. vulgaris&quot;, which is the Artemisia species designated as invasive by New York State.

== Cultivation and uses ==
The aromatic leaves of some species are used for flavouring. Most species have an extremely bitter taste. &quot;A. dracunculus&quot; (tarragon) is widely used as a culinary herb, particularly important in French cuisine.

&quot;Artemisia vulgaris&quot; (mugwort) was used to repel midges (mug &gt; midge), fleas and moths, intestinal worms, and in brewing (mugwort beer, mugwort wine) as a remedy against hangovers and nightmares.

&quot;Artemisia absinthium&quot; is used to make the highly potent spirit absinthe. Malört also contains wormwood. The aperitif vermouth is a wine flavored with aromatic herbs, but originally with wormwood.

&quot;Artemisia arborescens&quot; (tree wormwood, or &quot;sheeba&quot; in Arabic) is an aromatic herb indigenous to the Middle East used in tea, usually with mint.

A few species are grown as ornamental plants, the fine-textured ones used for clipped bordering. All grow best in free-draining sandy soil, unfertilized, and in full sun.

The largest collection of living Artemisia species, subspecies and cultivars is held in the National Collection of Artemisia in Sidmouth, Devon, UK, which holds about 400 taxa. The National Collection scheme is administered by Plant Heritage (formerly National Council for Conservation of Plants and Gardens, NCCPG) in the British Isles.

=== Medicinal uses ===
Artemisinin (from &quot;Artemisia annua&quot;) and derivatives are a group of compounds used to treat malaria. Treatments containing an artemisinin derivative (artemisinin-combination therapies) are now standard treatment worldwide for malaria caused by &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;. Administering &quot;Artemisia annua&quot; as dried whole leaves may cause resistance to develop more slowly than if it is administered as pure artemisinin.

Tu Youyou received the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her discovery of the semisynthetic derivatives. She conducted research on traditional Chinese medicine and potential contributions to cures for malaria, on the basis of folk medicine and ancient Chinese texts. From reviewing ancient Chinese texts, they found that the compound artemisinin was optimally extracted at lower temperatures, as high temperature water poured over sweet wormwood leaves destroyed essential treatment properties.

The World Health Organization does not support the promotion or use of &quot;Artemisia&quot; plant material in any form for the prevention or treatment of malaria. They note that the plant form of medication has several problems. These include a lack of consistent artemisinin content, the content being low enough that recurrence of malaria often occurs, that the use of the plant may contribute to widespread artemisinin resistance, and that the plant form is not effective in malaria prevention.

<text>The Chuvash people (, ; , ) are a Turkic ethnic group, a branch of the Oğurs, inhabiting an area stretching from the Idel-Ural region to Siberia.

Most of them live in Chuvash Republic and the surrounding areas, although Chuvash communities may be found throughout the Russian Federation as well as in Central Asia. They speak Chuvash, a Turkic language that diverged from other languages in the family more than a millennium ago. Among the Chuvash believers, the majority are Eastern Orthodox Christians although a minority follow Vattisen Yaly or Sunni Islam.

==Etymology==
There is no universally accepted etymology of the word &quot;Chuvash&quot;, but there are two theories. One theory suggests that the word &quot;Chuvash&quot; may be derived from Common Turkic &quot;jăvaş&quot; (&#x27;friendly&#x27;, &#x27;peaceful&#x27;), as opposed to &quot;şarmăs&quot; (&#x27;warlike&#x27;).

Another theory is that the word is derived from the &quot;Tabghach,&quot; an early medieval Xianbei clan and founders of the Northern Wei dynasty in China. The Old Turkic name &quot;Tabghach&quot; (&quot;Tuoba&quot; in Mandarin) was used by some Inner Asian peoples to refer to China long after this dynasty. Gerard Clauson has shown that through regular sound changes, the clan name Tabghach may have transformed to the ethnonym Chuvash.

==Language==
Chuvash is a Turkic language spoken in European Russia, primarily in the Chuvash Republic and adjacent areas. It is the only surviving member of the Oghur branch of Turkic languages, one of the two principal branches of the Turkic family. 

Although there is no direct evidence, some scholars believe that Chuvash may be descendant from a dialect of Volga Bulgar language while others support the idea that Chuvash is another distinct Oghur Turkic language. Since the surviving literary records for the non-Chuvash members of Oghuric (Bulgar and possibly Khazar) are scant, the exact position of Chuvash within the Oghuric family cannot be determined.

Some scholars suggest Hunnish had strong ties with Bulgar and to modern Chuvash and refer to this extended grouping as separate Hunno-Bulgar languages. However, such speculations are not based on proper linguistic evidence, since the language of the Huns is almost unknown except for a few attested words and personal names. Scholars generally consider Hunnish as unclassifiable. 

Italian historian and philologist Igor de Rachewiltz noted a significant distinction of the Chuvash language from other Turkic languages. According to him, the Chuvash language does not share certain common characteristics with Turkic languages to such a degree that some scholars consider Chuvash as an independent branch from Turkic and Mongolic. The Turkic classification of Chuvash was seen as a compromise solution for classification purposes.

Despite grammatical similarity with the rest of Turkic language family, the presence of changes in Chuvash pronunciation (which are hard to reconcile with other members of the Turkic family) has led some scholars to see Chuvash as originating not from Proto-Turkic, but from another proto-language spoken at the time of Proto-Turkic (in which case Chuvash and all the remaining Turkic languages would be part of a larger language family).

The Oghuric branch is distinguished from the rest of the Turkic family (the Common Turkic languages) by two sound changes: &quot;r&quot; corresponding to Common Turkic &quot;z&quot; and &quot;l&quot; corresponding to Common Turkic &quot;š&quot;. The first scientific fieldwork description of Chuvash, by August Ahlqvist in 1856, allowed researchers to establish its proper affiliation. 

Chuvash is so divergent from the main body of Turkic languages that Chuvash was first believed to be a Turkified Finno-Ugric language, or an intermediate branch between Turkic and Mongolic languages. Russian language and neighboring Mari and Volga Tatar heavily influenced the Chuvash language.

Mongolian, Arabic and Persian also influenced Chuvash. Chuvash language has two to three dialects. Although Chuvash is taught at schools and sometimes used in the media, it is considered endangered by the UNESCO, since Russian dominates in most spheres of life and few children learning the language are likely to become active users.

The subdivision of the Chuvash people are as below:
* &quot;Virjal&quot; (, &#x27;upper&#x27;)
* &quot;Anat jenchi&quot; (, &#x27;mid-lower&#x27;)
* &quot;Anatri&quot; (, &#x27;lower&#x27;)
* &quot;Hirti&quot; (, &#x27;steppe&#x27;) (this is a sub-group that is recognized by some researchers)

==History==
===Origins===
There are two rival schools of thought on the origin of the Chuvash people. One is that they originated from a mixing between the Sabir tribes and the Finno-Ugrians. The other is that they have descendant from Volga Bulgars. Throughout history, they have experienced significant infusion and influence, not only from Russian and other Turkic peoples but also from neighboring Uralic tribes with whom they were persistently and mistakenly identified for centuries. 

The Sabirs who believed to have come from Siberia, they lived there at least the end of the third millennium BC. They were skilled in warfare, used siege machinery, had a large army (including women) and were boatbuilders. Sabirs led incursions into Transcaucasia in the , but quickly began serving as soldiers and mercenaries during the Byzantine–Sasanian Wars on both sides. Their alliance with the Byzantines laid the basis for the later Khazar-Byzantine alliance.

===Early history===
In the early first century AD, the Bulgars whom may related to Chuvash started moving west through Zhetysu and the steppes of modern-day Kazakhstan, reaching the North Caucasus in the 2nd to 3rd centuries AD. There they established several states (Old Bulgaria on the Black Sea coast and the Suar Duchy in modern-day Dagestan). Old Bulgaria broke up in the second half of the 7th century after a series of successful Khazar invasions. Sabirs who were a tribe within the Khazar Khanate, subsequently undertook a migration to the Volga-Kama region along with other Oghuric tribes, ultimately founded the Volga Bulgaria, which eventually became extremely wealthy: its capital then being the 4th-largest city in the world.

Shortly after that, another state founded by Sabirs in Caucasus known as Suar Principality was forced to become a vassal state of Khazaria. About half a century later, the Suars took part in the Arab–Khazar wars of 732–737. The adoption of Islam in the early tenth century in Volga Bulgaria led to most of its people embracing that religion. 

After the Mongols destroyed Volga Bulgaria in 1236, the Golden Horde kept control of the region until its slow dissolution from 1438. The Kazan Khanate then became the new authority of the region and of the Chuvash. The modern name &quot;Chuvash&quot; began to appear in records starting from the sixteenth century from Russian and other foreign sources.

In 1552, the Russians conquered the Kazan Khanate and its territories. The Chuvash, required to pay yasak, gradually became dispossessed of much of their land. Many Chuvash who traditionally engaged in agriculture were forced to become bonded laborers in the timber industry or to work in barges due to growing poverty. The subsequent centuries saw the Christianization and Russification of the Chuvash. During this period, most Chuvash converted to Orthodox Christianity, but the Tsars never achieved their complete Russification. 

After conversion, Russian Historian Vasily Nikitich Tatishchev personally visited the lands of Volga Bulgaria and wrote in 1768 that Bulgars also migrated to Bashkortostan and North of Kazan (i.e. modern-day Chuvashia).

===Modern history===
The 18th and 19th centuries saw the revival of Chuvash culture and the publication of many educational, literary, and linguistic works, along with the establishment of schools and other programs. The Chuvash language began to be used in local schools, and a special written script for the Chuvash language was created in 1871.

On 24 June 1920, the Bolshevik government of the RSFSR established the Chuvash Autonomous Region; it became the Chuvash Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on 21 April 1925. Around this time Chuvash nationalism grew, but the Soviet authorities attempted to suppress nationalist movements by re-drawing the borders of the republic, leaving many Chuvash living in neighboring republics or in Russian districts. During most of the Soviet period of 1917–1991, the Chuvash were subjected to Russification campaigns.

The Chuvash language vanished from educational and public use. In 1989, another Chuvash cultural revival began - partly in response to these changes. Soon the Chuvash language once again came into use in educational, public, and political life. , schools in the Chuvash Republic and in areas outside that have large Chuvash populations teach the Chuvash language and culture. Chuvash people around Russia also have media available to them in their local communities.

==Genetics==
Physical anthropologists using the racial frameworks of the early 20th century saw the Chuvash as a mixed Finno-Ugric and Turkic people. An autosomal analysis (2015) detected an indication of Oghur and possibly Bulgar ancestry in modern Chuvash. These Oghur tribes brought the Chuvash language with them. Another study found some Finno-Ugric components in Chuvash people. 

Phenotypically, there is no particular differences among the Chuvash, as more Caucasoid or more Mongoloid phenotypes can be found among all subgroups. In 2017, a full genome study found Chuvash largely show a Finno-Ugric genetic component despite having a small common Turkic component with Bashkir and Tatar peoples. This study supported language shift hypothesis among Chuvash population.

==Culture==
They speak the Chuvash language and have some pre-Christian traditions. The Chuvash have specific patterns used in embroidery, which is found in their traditional clothing. Many people also use the Russian and Tatar languages, spoken in Chuvashia and nearby regions along the middle course of the Volga River, in the central part of European Russia.

==Religion==
Most Chuvash people are Eastern Orthodox Christians and belong to the Russian Orthodox Church while a minority are Sunni Muslims or practitioners of Vattisen Yaly. After the Russian subjugation of the Chuvash in the 16th century, a campaign of Christianization began. However, most Chuvash were not converted until the mid-19th century. The Chuvash retain some pre-Christian and pre-Islamic shamanism traditions in their cultural activities. Parallel pray in the shrines called and sacrifice geese there. One of the main shrines is located in the town of Bilyarsk. Vattisen Yaly is a contemporary revival of the ethnic religion of the Chuvash people. 

A minority of Chuvash may have been exposed to Islam as early as the Volga Bulgaria era but most of those early Chuvash likely converted during the Golden Horde period. An inscription dated at 1307 indicates that some Chuvash were converted to Islam, and religious terms occur in Chuvash in the form of Tatar loanwords. However, sources do not specify the practices of the Chuvash during this period. Some Chuvash who converted to Christianity following the Russian conquest converted to Islam during the 19th and early 20th century. During this period, several Chuvash communities were influenced by Tatars and became Muslim. This caused some Muslim Chuvash to define themselves as Tatars but they retained their language and several Chuvash customs.

<text>Richard Theodore Otcasek (March 23, 1944 – September 15, 2019), known as Ric Ocasek ( ), was an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He was the primary vocalist, rhythm guitarist, songwriter, and frontman for the American new wave band the Cars. In addition to his work with the Cars, Ocasek recorded seven solo albums, and his song &quot;Emotion in Motion&quot; was a top 20 hit in the United States in 1986. 

Ocasek also worked as a record producer for artists such as Motion City Soundtrack, Suicide, Bad Brains, Weezer, Nada Surf, Guided by Voices and No Doubt. In 2018, Ocasek was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Cars.

==Early life==
Ocasek was born in Baltimore on March 23, 1944. His paternal side was of Czech descent, and he grew up Catholic. When he was 16 years old, his father moved the family back to the Otcasek hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, where his father worked as a systems analyst with NASA at the Lewis Research Center. He graduated from Maple Heights High School in 1963. Ocasek briefly attended Antioch College and Bowling Green State University, but dropped out to pursue a career in music.

Ocasek met future Cars bassist Benjamin Orr in Cleveland in 1965 after Ocasek saw Orr performing with his band the Grasshoppers on the &quot;Big 5 Show&quot;, a local musical variety program. He reconnected with Orr a few years later in Columbus, Ohio, and the two began performing in and booking bands together. They formed a band called ID Nirvana in 1968 and performed in and around Ohio State University.

==Career==
===Early career===

After performing in various bands in Columbus and Ann Arbor, Michigan, Ocasek and Orr relocated to Boston in the early 1970s. There they formed a Crosby, Stills and Nash-style folk rock band called Milkwood. They released one album, &quot;How&#x27;s the Weather&quot;, on Paramount Records in early 1973 but it failed to chart. Future Cars keyboardist Greg Hawkes played on Milkwood&#x27;s album. After Milkwood, Ocasek formed the group Richard and the Rabbits, which included Orr and Hawkes. Ocasek and Orr also performed as an acoustic duo during this period. Some of the songs they played became the early Cars songs. Later, Ocasek and Orr teamed up with guitarist Elliot Easton in the band Cap&#x27;n Swing. Cap&#x27;n Swing soon came to the attention of WBCN disc jockey Maxanne Sartori, who began playing songs from their demo tape on her show. After Cap&#x27;n Swing was rejected by several record labels, Ocasek got rid of the bass player and drummer and decided to form a band that better fit his style of writing. Orr took over on bass and David Robinson, best known for his career with the Modern Lovers, became the drummer. Hawkes returned to play keyboards and the band became &quot;the Cars&quot; in late 1976.

===The Cars===
Ocasek was a founding member of the Cars, recording numerous hit songs from 1978 to 1988. He played rhythm guitar and sang lead vocals for a majority of songs (bassist Benjamin Orr was lead vocalist on the remaining tracks). Ocasek was the oldest member of the band. After splitting writing duty with Orr in the 1970s, Ocasek became the principal songwriter of the band, and wrote nearly all of the Cars&#x27; material, sharing credit on only a few songs with bandmate Greg Hawkes as co-writer. In 2010, Ocasek reunited with the surviving original members of the Cars to record their first album in 24 years. The album, entitled &quot;Move Like This&quot;, was released on May 10, 2011. Not long after the album&#x27;s release and its supporting tour, however, the Cars resumed their hiatus, and reunited once again in April 2018 for a performance at the ceremony of their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

====Production====
During his time with the Cars, Ocasek developed a reputation as a producer, and took this role for many up-and-coming bands of differing genres including Bad Brains&#x27; &quot;Rock for Light&quot; and Guided by Voices&#x27; &quot;Do the Collapse&quot;. His other production credits include Weezer&#x27;s Blue Album and Green Album (both multi-platinum), Suicide, Romeo Void, Hole, Bebe Buell, No Doubt, Nada Surf, American folk-punk band Black 47, Bad Religion, Johnny Bravo, D Generation, the Wannadies, Possum Dixon, Martin Rev, Jonathan Richman, and the 2006 album by the Pink Spiders titled &quot;Teenage Graffiti&quot;. He also produced a portion of the third Motion City Soundtrack album, &quot;Even If It Kills Me&quot;. In 2014, Ocasek produced &quot;Everything Will Be Alright in the End&quot;, the ninth studio album by Weezer and his third collaboration with the band, and &quot;For All My Sisters&quot;, the sixth album by the Cribs, which was the final album he produced.

===Solo career===
Ocasek released his first solo album in January 1983, &quot;Beatitude&quot;, which features a more minimal and sparse interpretation of the Cars&#x27; new wave rock sound. On some tracks Ocasek played all of the instruments. Greg Hawkes also played on the album, as did Fuzzbee Morse from Richard and the Rabbits. A more synthesizer-heavy follow-up, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, was released in 1986; this featured Greg Hawkes, Elliot Easton and Benjamin Orr. A No. 15 hit single, &quot;Emotion in Motion&quot;, accompanied the album. In a 1986 interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Ocasek said he did not write songs deliberately with the Cars in mind, and he chose to save his &quot;moodier&quot; material for his solo albums: &quot;I slant my solo albums so that they have a few songs that the Cars really couldn`t do. Weirder songs. More poetic.&quot;

The Cars disbanded in 1988, and Ocasek disappeared from the public eye for a couple of years. He resurfaced in 1990 with his own album, &quot;Fireball Zone&quot;. One track, &quot;Rockaway&quot;, enjoyed a brief stay on the charts, but his solo albums realized disappointing sales, especially compared to his success with the Cars. He subsequently released other solo works during the decade, including 1993&#x27;s &quot;Quick Change World&quot;, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Getchertiktz&quot; (a collaboration with Suicide&#x27;s Alan Vega and Canadian poet Gillian McCain comprising only Beat poetry set to music, sound effects, etc.), and 1997&#x27;s Billy Corgan-produced &quot;Troublizing&quot; (which Ocasek supported with a very brief tour, his first since leaving the Cars). In 2005, Ocasek released another album, &quot;Nexterday&quot;, to little fanfare, but it received positive reviews.

==In other media==
Ocasek wrote a book of poetry in 1993 titled &quot;Negative Theatre&quot;. It was at one time expected to be incorporated into an album and multimedia incarnation of the same name, but those plans were dropped abruptly. For many years Ocasek had a hobby of making drawings, photo collages, and mixed-media art works which, in 2009, were shown at a gallery in Columbus, Ohio, as an exhibition called &quot;Teahead Scraps&quot;.

Ocasek had a cameo role as a beatnik painter in the John Waters film &quot;Hairspray&quot; (1988), and had a small part in the movie &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; (1987) in which he played a mechanic.

Ocasek stated in a 2005 interview in &quot;Rockline&quot; that he hated touring and was unlikely to do so again. He also stated he would not be reuniting with the Cars again, but gave the okay to his former bandmates to do so, with Todd Rundgren replacing him on vocals, using the name the New Cars.

On April 17, 2006, Ocasek appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; and volunteered to put Todd Rundgren &quot;on notice&quot;. He appeared again on the July 26, 2006, episode to cheers from the audience as he volunteered to lead a commando mission to &quot;rescue&quot; Stephen Jr., the baby eagle at the San Francisco Zoo named after Stephen Colbert. He also appeared again on April 18, 2007, in order to support his wife during her appearance on the show, after remarks that she found Colbert &quot;extremely attractive&quot;. He has been mentioned many times in other episodes as well. The Cars, with Ocasek, appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on August 9, 2011, to promote their new album, &quot;Move Like This&quot;.

In 2012, Ocasek released &quot;Lyrics and Prose&quot;, a complete collection of lyrics from his solo and Cars&#x27; albums. The book also contains prose and poetry never set to music, as well as previously unpublished photographs and artwork.

==Personal life==
Ocasek and Cars co-founder Benjamin Orr were close friends who became estranged when the band broke up. The two reconciled prior to Orr&#x27;s death in 2000. Their friendship was commemorated in the song &quot;Silver&quot;, which Ocasek wrote in memory of Orr.

Ocasek was married three times. His first wife Constance divorced him in Ohio in 1971. In the same year he married Suzanne Otcasek, who uses the original spelling of Ocasek&#x27;s name. They were married for 17 years. During filming of the music video for the Cars&#x27; song &quot;Drive&quot; in 1984, Ocasek met 19-year-old Czech-born supermodel Paulina Porizkova, while he was still married to Suzanne. Ocasek and Suzanne divorced in 1988. He and Porizkova were married on August 23, 1989 on Saint-Barthélemy island. In May 2018, Porizkova announced she and Ocasek had separated a year earlier.

Ocasek had six sons, two from each of his three marriages. His eldest son, Christopher (b. 1964), is a singer who formed the rock group Glamour Camp, which released one album in 1989, and appeared as a solo artist on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990). His other children include Adam (b. 1970), Eron (b. 1973), Derek (b. 1981), Jonathan Raven (b. 1993), and Oliver (b. 1998).

==Death==
Ocasek was found dead on September 15, 2019, by his estranged wife, Paulina Porizkova, at his New York City townhouse, which they still shared following their separation in 2017. He had been recovering from surgery. The Chief Medical Examiner office reported that Ocasek died from natural causes. He suffered from both hypertensive heart and coronary artery disease.

Ocasek is buried at Nine Partners Cemetery in Millbrook, New York.

Porizkova and Ocasek were still in the process of their divorce at the time of his death, but he had disinherited her in a new will, alleging that before his recent surgery she had abandoned him. This required a surrogate court judge rule on the veracity of the abandonment claims before the remaining estate could be divided. He also disinherited two of his six sons (Chris and Adam).

In 2021, the dispute between Ocasek&#x27;s estate and Porizkova was settled; Porizkova said she was granted a third of his estate, commenting &quot;They gave me what is mine under New York state law, and we&#x27;re done.&quot; Porizkova would not tell &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; the precise terms of the settlement, but said that the estate was not worth $5 million as was widely reported soon after Ocasek&#x27;s death.
===Misrepresentation of age===
Upon Ocasek&#x27;s death, his age was widely misreported as 70, not 75. In a 1979 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; soon after the Cars became popular, he claimed to be 29 rather than his true age of 34, and a false birth year of 1949 was subsequently listed in artist biographies from sources including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Spotify. His New York City voter registration—which was available as public records but was based on voter-provided information that the New York City Board of Elections did not routinely verify—also listed a March 23, 1949, birth date. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ocasek never corrected his age and birth year in later interviews or press releases, but a preponderance of other government records and his self-acknowledged 1963 high school graduation date indicate that he was born in 1944. Additionally, the 1950 United States census indicates that a six-year-old Richard T Otcasek was living in Baltimore, Maryland, with his parents.

<text>George Alfred Christian Knudson, CM (June 28, 1937 – January 24, 1989) was a Canadian professional golfer, who along with Mike Weir holds the record for the Canadian with the most wins on the PGA Tour, with eight career victories.

== Early life and amateur career ==
Knudson was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He learned to play golf at the St. Charles Country Club. He won the 1954 and 1955 Manitoba Junior Championships. In addition, he won the 1955 Canadian Junior Championship. 

== Professional career ==
In 1958, Knudson moved to Toronto and worked at the Oakdale Golf &amp; Country Club where he received instruction and encouragement from the Club, to improve his game; the club has named one of its three nines after him. He was then able to secure some financial backing to try the PGA Tour. He won the Manitoba Open in 1958, 1959, and 1960, and the Ontario Open in 1960, 1961, 1971, 1976 and 1978.

Between 1961 and 1972, he won eight tournaments on the PGA Tour. He won the Canadian PGA Championship five times, and won the World Cup with Al Balding in 1968.

Knudson&#x27;s last official PGA TOUR victory was the Kaiser Invitational in October 1972. However, Knudson nearly won again the next week at the Sahara Invitational. He carried the lead going into the final round at 15-under par after shooting 65-70-66, but a final round 76 dropped him into a T-7th at 11-under.

In seven Masters appearances, Knudson posted three top-10s, including 10th in his 1965 debut and sixth a year later. Knudson&#x27;s best finish in a major championship was a tie for second in the 1969 Masters Tournament, one shot behind champion George Archer. Knudson&#x27;s birdie putt on the 72nd hole to tie Archer came up 3 inches short.

Knudson left tournament golf in the late 1970s, and started teaching golf, with success, at a facility in the Toronto area. His teaching methods have since been adopted by the Canadian PGA.

==Death==
Knudson had long been a heavy smoker and was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1987. He recovered well enough to compete at the 1988 Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf senior tournament. Shortly thereafter, it was discovered the cancer had spread to his brain. George Knudson died in January 1989 at age 51 and was buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto.

== Awards and honors ==

<text>LINPACK is a software library for performing numerical linear algebra on digital computers.
It was written in Fortran by Jack Dongarra, Jim Bunch, Cleve Moler, and Gilbert Stewart, and was intended for use on supercomputers in the 1970s and early 1980s. It has been largely superseded by LAPACK, which runs more efficiently on modern architectures.

LINPACK makes use of the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) libraries for performing basic vector and matrix operations.

The LINPACK benchmarks appeared initially as part of the LINPACK user&#x27;s manual. The parallel LINPACK benchmark implementation called HPL (High Performance Linpack) is used to benchmark and rank supercomputers for the TOP500 list.
