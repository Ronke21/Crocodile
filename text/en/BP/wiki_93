<text>The Wah Mee massacre was a mass shooting that occurred during the night of February 18–19, 1983, in the Wah Mee gambling club at the Louisa Hotel in Seattle, Washington, United States. Fourteen people were bound, robbed and shot by three gunmen, 22-year-old Kwan Fai &quot;Willie&quot; Mak, 20-year old Keung Kin &quot;Benjamin&quot; Ng and 25-year-old Wai Chiu &quot;Tony&quot; Ng (no relation). Thirteen of the victims died, but 61-year-old Wai Yok Chin, a former U.S. Navy sailor and Pai Gow dealer at the Wah Mee, survived to testify against the three in the separate high-profile trials held between 1983 and 1985.

Mak and Benjamin Ng were both given life imprisonment, after Mak&#x27;s initial death sentence was overturned in 1988, while Tony Ng received a 30-year sentence, serving 28 years before he was released and deported to his native Hong Kong in 2014. It remains the deadliest mass murder in the history of Washington State.

== Background ==
=== Louisa Hotel and Wah Mee Club ===

The Louisa Hotel was built in 1909. Paul Woo purchased the building in 1963 for . Both before and after that purchase, it functioned as a single room occupancy hotel (SRO) with street-level spaces for shops and restaurants until 1970, when tightened building codes led to the closure of the SRO portion.

Two nightclubs operated illegally in the basement space of the hotel by the 1920s. The one in the western half, entered from Maynard Alley South, was originally named Blue Heaven. At its height, patrons of many ethnic backgrounds visited to partake in gambling, dancing and other forms of entertainment. By the 1950s, the club had been renamed to Wah Mee (), known for high-stakes gaming. The Wah Mee operated illegally, as contemporary local blue laws required clubs to close before midnight; it was raided by police in 1972. By the 1980s, the Wah Mee had gained a much seedier reputation as a dive bar.

===Planning and motive===
Regulars at the Wah Mee included many wealthy restaurant owners, several of whom were among the victims. Many of the victims were members of the Bing Kung Tong out of San Francisco. According to witnesses for the subsequent prosecution, Willie Mak had been planning the robbery for some time, discussing on multiple occasions his idea to rob a gambling club and kill the witnesses. He eventually enlisted the help of Benjamin Ng; both Ng and Mak were born in Guangdong Province, had previously attended Cleveland High School, were members of the Hop Sing Tong. and worked at the same restaurant in Blaine in 1981. Both were also suspects in prior crimes, including the killing of two Chinese women in Beacon Hill on July 16, 1982. Ng was also known to have shot and injured a teenager named Michael Chinn in 1981, after the victim had confronted Ng about him slashing the tires of his car.

Tony Ng (no relation to Benjamin Ng), who had also attended Cleveland High School with them, was brought into the group as a &quot;last-minute recruit&quot;. According to Tony&#x27;s testimony at his 1985 trial, he owed Mak $1,000 after gambling with Mak the night before the massacre. Mak offered to forgive the debt if he would participate in a shakedown at the Wah Mee. The day before the robbery, Tony borrowed $1,000 to repay Mak; instead of accepting the money, Mak drew a gun, shot a bullet at Ng&#x27;s feet, and threatened to kill Ng and his girlfriend, then destroy the Ng family&#x27;s restaurant, if Ng went to the police.
Security at the Wah Mee was based in part on a system of passing through two sets of locked doors, which had been used in similar Chinatown gambling dens for generations and had usually been quite effective. The security office at the front of the club had four rows of opaque glass blocks; one block facing the vestibule was transparent so the security guard on duty could identify patrons and staff. The outer set of doors could only be unlocked from the inside by the guard. Mak and his accomplices defeated the system only because they were known and trusted by the people at the club. During the initial investigation, police stated there were no signs of resistance from the victims; a spokesman said he &quot;believe[d] they recognized [the killers].&quot; Their presumed intent in killing all occupants was to leave no witnesses, since club patrons could have readily identified them — as the one survivor, dealer Wai Yok Chin, did.

== Massacre ==

===Sequence===
On the night of February 18, 1983, Chin arrived at approximately 11:50–11:55 PM for his regular shift as a pai gow dealer, which started at midnight. Shortly after his shift began, he saw either Mak or Benjamin (the identity varies depending on the source), both of whom he recognized as club patrons, enter with a man he did not know (later identified as Tony). Both Mak (or Benjamin) and Tony then drew their guns, ordering everyone to lie down on the club&#x27;s lower level. At the time, there were ten other patrons and staff present besides the three gunmen. Approximately ten minutes later, either Benjamin or Mak entered the club; Mak stood on the club&#x27;s upper level with a drawn gun, supervising Benjamin and Tony as they methodically hogtied each victim&#x27;s hands and feet with rope, laying them on their stomachs before proceeding to rob the victims of their wallets and money.

While the robbery was in progress, four more patrons arrived; they too were bound and robbed. Chin convinced Tony, who was tying his bonds, to loosen the rope, as there was &quot;no need to tie so tight, I&#x27;m an old man&quot;. Once everyone was tied up, Chin heard and was struck by gunfire in the neck and jaw, and lapsed into unconsciousness. Tony testified at trial that although he had a gun, he never used it and was forced to participate in the robbery under duress. According to Tony, Mak instructed him to take the money and leave after all the victims had been bound; he fled across the alley to the Hop Sing Club to wait for Mak and Benjamin. Tony further testified that he heard gunshots after he had already exited the Wah Mee. When Chin came to, he was able to loosen his ropes and staggered outside at 12:44 AM, where he was able to find help from three patrons who had been buzzing to gain entry to the club. After the police arrived, they found twelve dead; one more victim, Wah Mee manager John Loui, subsequently died of his injuries at the hospital, and Chin was the sole survivor.

According to the police, thirty-two shots were fired in total; twenty-six of those were fired from the same .22 caliber gun. Each victim had been shot in the head at least once.

===Aftermath===

Following the shooting, the doors to the Wah Mee were padlocked shut, and the contents were not disturbed after the police left. The club was never reopened, although the site was a popular stop for tour buses.

A spokesman for the Hop Sing Tong denied the massacre was an act of war against the Bing Kung Tong; Mak and Benjamin Ng were both members of the Hop Sing, and most of the victims were members of the Bing Kung.Chin, the sole survivor of the massacre, made a full recovery despite an early medical setback and possible assassination threats that forced prosecutors to depose him on videotape prior to the trials. He died in May 1993, aged 71.

The Louisa Hotel continued to host street-level businesses until a fire on Christmas Eve 2013 destroyed the top floor and interior of the building. The Woo family, who still owned the building, decided to demolish the fire-damaged portion (which included all of the former Wah Mee space) while retaining as much of the building as possible to preserve its contribution to the Chinatown Historic District. Demolition work was completed in April 2015. Reconstruction began February 12, 2018, with a blessing by Buddhist monks and a procession. The building reopened June 2019, with eighty-five rental apartments plus street-level retail and restaurant space.

==Victims==
All 13 victims, twelve men and one woman, were of Cantonese-speaking Chinese origin, most from Hong Kong or Taishan. Four of the dead, 48-year-old John S. Loui, 54-year-old Hung Fat Gee, 52-year-old Henning G. Chinn and 54-year-old Gim Lun Wong, were employees at the Wah Mee (manager, cook/waiter and doormen respectively). The remaining eight were patrons, identified as 52-year-old restaurateur Moo Min Mar, 47-year-old Jean Bick Chinn, 60-year-old retired postal worker Jack Mar, 68-year-old Kokusai Theater projectionist Dewey Mar, 59-year-old line cook and former U.S. Army sergeant Wing Wong, 60-year-old fisherman and cook Lung Wing Chin, 51-year-old car repair shop owner and part-time employee Chin Lee Law, 47-year-old chef George Mar, and 55-year-old cook and legionnaire of Cathay Post 186 Chong L. Chin. Besides Moo Min Mar and Jean Chinn, who were husband and wife, none of the victims were related. With the exception of Henning Chinn, all victims were members of the Bing Kung Tong.

== Arrests ==
Chin was able to identify both Mak and Benjamin for the police; the identity of the third gunman was unknown to him.

In the early morning of February 19, the Seattle police went to the home of Benjamin&#x27;s brother, Stephen, who told them that Benjamin lived with his girlfriend in her parents&#x27; home. The police arrested Benjamin at the girlfriend&#x27;s residence, where he had been sleeping. After obtaining a search warrant, the police returned later that afternoon to find $7,500 in cash, two loaded .38 caliber revolvers, an M-1 rifle and ammunition in the bedroom.

Mak called and turned himself in to police hours later. Shortly after his arrest, he confessed that he had &quot;shot them all&quot;, a statement he later repudiated. Police recovered more guns and cash from Mak&#x27;s home on February 19, but none of the guns matched those used in the murders. An unidentified third man, who accompanied Mak to the surrender, was questioned and released. Two men, including Mak&#x27;s older brother, were accused of destroying evidence of the crime; Mak had borrowed a car from one of the men the night of the massacre.

Police identified Tony Ng as the third suspect and issued a federal warrant for his arrest on March 31, 1983. After speaking with his mother the morning after the massacre, Tony fled to Canada upon learning that thirteen people had been killed. The Bing Kung Tong offered a reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction. On June 15, 1984, Tony became the 387th person to be listed on the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. He was arrested October 4, 1984, in Calgary, Alberta, by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, acting on a tip made to Seattle police. At the time, Tony was working as an electronics assembly technician under the alias Jim Wong, living with a roommate who was unaware of his fugitive status; police suspected he had been partially supported by his family. His extradition to the U.S. was blocked by his Canadian lawyer until American authorities dropped the charges that could have resulted in the death penalty.

==Trials and sentencing==
On February 24, 1983, Mak and Benjamin were charged with thirteen counts of aggravated first-degree murder and one count of first degree assault. Benjamin was represented by Seattle defense lawyer John Henry Browne. Mak was represented by the associated counsel for the accused, lawyers Jim Robinson and Don Madsen. The State was represented by William Downing and Robert Lasnik. On March 22, Judge Frank D. Howard set a preliminary trial date for both Benjamin and Mak for April 20, but they were tried separately because the defense believed Mak would blame Ng. Tony was named the third suspect, charged &quot;in absentia&quot; on March 30, 1983, with thirteen counts of aggravated first-degree murder.

===Benjamin Ng===
On August 25, 1983, Benjamin was convicted on the thirteen counts of aggravated first-degree murder after two to three hours of deliberation and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on the next day. During the sentencing phase, Benjamin&#x27;s mother testified on his behalf, stating the family had emigrated from Hong Kong in 1975; while still in Hong Kong, Benjamin had been beaten on the head repeatedly with a piece of wood, resulting in brain damage, as corroborated by medical experts.

Jury selection for the trial began on August 9. Initially, Ng&#x27;s defense claimed he did not shoot anyone, as the weapons found in the bedroom of his girlfriend were a different caliber, but the prosecution asserted that .22 caliber shell casings recovered at the Wah Mee scene matched a gun that Ng once fired. During the trial, Ng&#x27;s attorney conceded that he had participated in the robbery and was guilty of first-degree murder, but not aggravated first-degree murder; the distinction, had he been convicted of first-degree murder without aggravation, would have made him ineligible for the death penalty and would have raised the possibility of parole. The defense had contended that although Benjamin Ng had participated in planning the robbery, he did not plan to murder the victims to silence potential witnesses. The jury concluded that Ng had killed in furtherance of the robbery, justifying the aggravated murder enhancement.

Ng was sentenced to a 15th life sentence in December 1983, after testimony accusing him of the unrelated murder of Franklin E. Leach near Lake Washington on October 22, 1981, was introduced during Mak&#x27;s trial.

===Willie Mak===
On October 6, 1983, Willie Mak was convicted of 13 counts of aggravated first degree murder and one count of first-degree assault and sentenced to death by hanging on October 22. On April 24, 1986, the Washington State Supreme Court upheld the verdict and death sentence.

Jury selection for the trial began on September 12. The defense were expected to blame an unnamed individual who wished to gain control over illegal gambling operations in Chinatown. At his trial, Mak claimed that he had only gone to the Wah Mee to rough up a patron as retaliation for the beating of a senior Hop Sing Tong official. Mak, a member of the Hop Sing along with Benjamin Ng, claimed he was directed to do so by Roy Chu, president of the Hop Sing, an allegation which Chu denied. According to Mak&#x27;s testimony, Benjamin Ng and his companion were independently robbing the patrons and Mak left before any shooting occurred, but he heard &quot;snapping sounds&quot; as he left. In addition, Mak&#x27;s lawyer argued that Benjamin Ng was the shooter at the Wah Mee by blaming Ng for the unsolved murder of Franklin Leach, aged 71, in 1981. According to Jim Robinson, Leach was shot when he jogged by Mak and Ng as they were dumping a stolen safe into Lake Washington. During the trial, prosecutors and police used hypnosis to change the testimony of a defense witness.

On February 17, 1987 the Washington State Supreme Court issued a stay of execution a month before Willie Mak&#x27;s scheduled execution, but on May 2, 1988 the State Supreme Court let Mak&#x27;s murder conviction stand. However, on November 10, 1988, Willie Mak&#x27;s execution was delayed indefinitely by a federal judge. On January 8, 1991 U.S. District Judge William Dwyer overturned Willie Mak&#x27;s death sentence, saying Mak&#x27;s attorneys failed to present evidence on their client&#x27;s background that could have saved his life. On July 16, 1992, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate Mak&#x27;s death sentence.

On November 9, 1994, a King County Superior Court judge denied Mak&#x27;s bid for a new trial but allowed prosecutors to hold a new sentencing hearing. On February 15, 2002, a King County Superior Court judge scheduled a sentencing hearing for September 2002. On April 29, 2002, a King County Superior Court judge ruled that Mak will not face execution since the 1983 jury wasn&#x27;t asked to determine how much of a role he had in the crime. Mak was resentenced to life without parole.

===Tony Ng===
Tony Ng was acquitted on April 19, 1985, of murder, but convicted of 13 counts of first-degree robbery and a single count of assault with a deadly weapon. Each robbery charge brought a minimum sentence of five years, some to be served consecutively. On July 3, 1985, Tony Ng was sentenced to 13 life terms, one for each count of first-degree robbery, which would mean a term of 35 years in total.

The jury selection for Tony Ng&#x27;s trial was completed on April 4 after four days of proceedings. Tony Ng was represented at his trial by Mark Mestel and John Muenster. Defense attorneys questioned whether the 45-minute statement Ng gave to the RCMP upon his arrest in Calgary was admissible, as he had not been advised of his rights. Prior to the trial, prosecutors stated they would not seek the death penalty, as the earlier trials of Benjamin Ng and Mak showed that Tony Ng did not play a part in the planning of the crime. At his trial, the defense argued that Ng &quot;had no reason in the world to [participate in the robbery]&quot; and drew a contrast between the &quot;homicidal maniacs&quot; Mak and Benjamin Ng and his client, characterized as quiet, shy, and passive. The prosecution countered by asking why Mak and Benjamin Ng would &quot;drag an unwilling witness into a crime that had as a central facet the elimination of all witnesses&quot;.

In 1997, federal magistrate John Weinberg concluded that Ng did not receive a fair trial in 1985 and recommended either his release or a new trial. No action was required unless a U.S. District Court judge acted on his recommendation.
On September 6, 2006, a parole board met to determine whether Tony Ng should receive parole on his 12th robbery term. If given parole, he would begin serving his 13th term, with the potential to be eligible for parole and freed in 2010. Both former King County Prosecuting Attorney Norm Maleng and former Seattle Police Chief Patrick Fitzsimons asked the parole board to deny parole on the 12th count. Relatives of the victims who came to the hearing expressed outrage that they were not made aware of previous parole hearings and that Tony Ng was so close to possible release because of it. Ng was denied parole in 2007, which meant he could not begin serving time on the final count.

In December 2009, the parole of Tony Ng again came before the state parole board; relatives of the victims again spoke before the board, urging against his release. In February 2010, a parole board unanimously decided &quot;now is the time to parole Mr. [Tony] Ng to his final count.&quot; On October 24, 2013, Tony Ng was granted parole. Although the relatives of the victims continued to oppose the parole, he was released on October 25, 2013, from state prison directly to the Northwest detention center in Tacoma, into the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation proceedings. He was deported to Hong Kong on May 13, 2014.

<text>Elinor Caplan (born May 20, 1944) is a businesswoman and former politician in Ontario, Canada. She served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 1997, and was a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2004. A Liberal, she served as a cabinet minister in the provincial government of David Peterson and the federal government of Jean Chrétien.

==Background==
She was born in Toronto to Samuel S. Hershorn, a textile manufacturer, and his wife Thelma (Goodman) Hershorn, both of whose families had come to Canada from Russian Poland. Caplan attended Oakwood Collegiate Institute in Toronto, and then Centennial College. She then worked in real estate heading Elinor Caplan and Associates from 1973 to 1978. Her husband, Wilfred, sought election to the provincial legislature in the 1977 election, but was defeated. Caplan is Jewish, and is a longtime member of Canadian Hadassah-WIZO, a women&#x27;s Zionist organization.

==Politics==

===Municipal===
She ran for office in 1978, when she was elected to the North York municipal council as an alderman.

===Provincial===
She ran for the provincial legislature in the 1981 election, but lost to Progressive Conservative David Rotenberg in the constituency of Wilson Heights.

She was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1985 election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent John Williams by over 4,000 votes in the North York riding of Oriole. The Liberal Party formed a minority government after this election, and Caplan was appointed as Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet on June 26, 1985. She resigned her portfolio on June 16, 1986, following accusations of a conflict of interest relating to her husband&#x27;s business dealings; while protesting her innocence, she claimed she had lost the confidence of the house. Caplan was subsequently exonerated by a parliamentary commission.

Caplan won a landslide re-election victory in the provincial election of 1987, She was reappointed to Peterson&#x27;s cabinet on September 29, 1987, as Minister of Health. She held this position until the Liberals were defeated by the Ontario New Democratic Party in the 1990 election. Caplan defeated NDP candidate Lennox Farrell by just over 2,000 votes in the 1990 campaign, and remained a prominent figure in the official opposition, serving as Deputy House Leader in 1994–95.

In the 1995 election, Caplan narrowly retained her seat against a challenge from Progressive Conservative Paul Sutherland. She served as Chief Opposition Whip from 1995 to 1996, and retired from the legislature on May 1, 1997. (She was succeeded as the MPP for Oriole by her son, David Caplan, who went on to serve as a cabinet minister in the government of Dalton McGuinty.) In 1996, she supported Joseph Cordiano for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party.

===Provincial Cabinet posts===


===Federal politics===
Caplan was elected to the federal House of Commons in the 1997 election, defeating her closest opponent by more than 14,000 votes in the riding of Thornhill. She served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Health in 1998–99, and was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Citizenship and Immigration on August 3, 1999.

In the 2000 federal election, Caplan faced an inexperienced opponent from the Canadian Alliance and was easily re-elected. After a cabinet shuffle on January 15, 2002, Caplan was appointed Minister of National Revenue. She was dropped from cabinet when Paul Martin replaced Chrétien as Prime Minister in December 2003. She did not seek re-election in the 2004 election.

===Federal Cabinet posts===


==After politics==
In late 2004, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty appointed Caplan to lead a provincial inquiry into the state of home-care medical services.

<doc id="485539" wikidata="Q19951434" url="?curid=485539" title="List of presidents of departmental councils (France)">
<text>In France, the President of the Departmental Council (French: &quot;Président du Conseil départemental&quot;) is the locally elected head of the departmental council, the assembly governing a department in France. The position is elected by the departmental councillors from among their number. If there is a tie, the councillor senior of age is elected.

As per Articles L1111-1 to L7331-3 of the General code of local and regional authorities, the responsibilities of the President of the Departmental Council include:
* Chairing the departmental authorities
* Preparing and implementing the council&#x27;s decisions
* Collection of tax revenues 
* Representing the department in legal cases

==History==
In 1833, a law was enacted that gave each canton (subdivision of a department) representation of a councillor (&quot;Conseiller général&quot;).

As a result of the decentralisation of government (Deferre law), the election criteria were redefined in 1982 and the President of the Departmental Council took over executive powers from the centrally-appointed prefect.

<text>Mortal Kombat Annihilation is a 1997 American martial arts fantasy film directed by John R. Leonetti in his directorial debut. Based on the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; video game franchise, it is the second installment in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; film series and a sequel to the original 1995 film, on which Leonetti served as cinematographer. Largely adapted from the 1995 video game &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, &quot;Annihilation&quot; follows Liu Kang and his allies as they attempt to prevent the malevolent Shao Kahn from conquering Earthrealm. It stars Robin Shou as Liu Kang, Talisa Soto as Kitana, James Remar as Raiden, Sandra Hess as Sonya Blade, Lynn “Red” Williams as Jax and Brian Thompson as Shao Kahn. Only Shou and Soto reprised their roles, with the other characters from the previous film being recast.

&quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; was theatrically released on November 21, 1997 by New Line Cinema. It received negative reviews and grossed $51.3 million. A direct sequel was consequently canceled and a third film languished in development hell for nearly two decades until the series was rebooted in 2021.

==Plot==
The Outworld emperor Shao Kahn opens a portal to Earthrealm and has resurrected Queen Sindel, Princess Kitana&#x27;s long-deceased mother, to facilitate his invasion. Thunder god Raiden and Earthrealm warriors Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, and Johnny Cage try to defend themselves, but Kahn kills Cage. The Earthrealm warriors retreat to seek allies.

Sonya Blade enlists the help of her Special Forces partner, Jax, while Kitana and Liu search for a Native American shaman named Nightwolf, who seemingly knows the key to defeating Kahn. Scorpion appears and kidnaps Kitana.

Raiden meets with the Elder Gods and asks them why Kahn was allowed to break the tournament rules and force his way into Earthrealm, and how he can be stopped. One says that reuniting Kitana with her mother, Sindel, is the key to breaking Kahn&#x27;s hold on Earthrealm, but another Elder God insists that the defeat of Kahn himself is the solution. Raiden is then asked by the Elder Gods about his feelings and obligations towards the mortals, and what he would be willing to do to ensure their survival.

Liu finds Nightwolf, who teaches him about the power of the Animality, a form of shapeshifting which utilizes the caster&#x27;s strengths and abilities. To achieve the mindset needed to acquire this power, Liu must pass three tests. The first is a trial of his self-esteem, courage, and focus. The second comes in the form of temptation, which manifests itself in the form of Jade, a mysterious warrior who attempts to seduce Liu and offers her assistance after he resists her advances. Liu accepts Jade&#x27;s offer and takes her with him to the Elder Gods&#x27; temple, where he and his friends meet with Raiden. The third test is never revealed.

The Earthrealm warriors learn that Raiden has sacrificed his immortality to freely fight alongside them. Together, they infiltrate Outworld to rescue Kitana and reunite her with Sindel in hopes of restoring her soul and closing the Outworld portal to Earth. Liu rescues Kitana while the others incapacitate Sindel. However, Sindel remains under Kahn&#x27;s control and escapes during an ambush. Jade reveals herself to be a double agent sent by Kahn to disrupt the heroes&#x27; plans. Kahn feeds Jade to a gargoyle for her failure. Raiden reveals that Shao Kahn is his brother and that the former Elder God Shinnok is their father. He realizes that Shinnok is supporting Kahn. Raiden and the Earthrealm warriors make their way to Kahn, Sindel, and his remaining generals. Shinnok demands that Raiden submit to him and restore their broken family, at the expense of his mortal friends. Raiden refuses and is killed by an energy blast from Shao Kahn.

Jax, Sonya, and Kitana emerge victorious over Kahn&#x27;s generals (with Jax defeating Motaro, Kitana defeating her mother, and Sonya defeating Ermac). Liu struggles with Kahn. Liu&#x27;s Animality proves effective, exposing a cut to Kahn that proves he is now mortal, as a consequence of his breaking the sacred rules. Shinnok attempts to intervene and kill Liu on Kahn&#x27;s behalf, but two of the Elder Gods arrive, having uncovered Shinnok&#x27;s treachery. They declare that the fate of Earth shall be decided in Mortal Kombat. Liu defeats Kahn, and Shinnok is banished to the Netherrealm. Earthrealm reverts to its former state. With Kahn&#x27;s hold over Sindel broken, she reunites with Kitana. Raiden is revived by the Elder Gods, who bestow upon him his father&#x27;s former position. Before departing to the immortal realm, he enjoins the Earthrealm warriors to be there for one another. The Earthrealm warriors return home.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; is loosely based on the 1995 video game &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, while featuring the character roster of &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;. There were also plot elements from &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;, but these scenes were cut from the final theatrical version. While the original attracted casual moviegoers as well as gamers, &quot;Annihilation&quot; catered exclusively to the games&#x27; fans. Producer Lawrence Kasanoff said he was trying to make the film &quot;even more spectacular than the first movie, which earned a healthy $73 million in the U.S. &quot;Annihilation&quot; is three times more ambitious than &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. Our theme for the sequel is to shoot for more—more fights, more special effects, more Outworld, more everything.&quot;

Filming began in the first quarter of 1996. Part of the movie was filmed on location at Parys Mountain on the island of Anglesey, off the coast of Wales (incorrectly listed as being part of England in the closing credits). Other filming locations included London, Jordan, and Thailand. Though &quot;Annihilation&quot; attempted to continue in the style of the first movie, the cast of returning characters from the original was almost completely overhauled; only Robin Shou (Liu Kang) and Talisa Soto (Kitana) reprised their roles, while the only other actor to return was Keith Cooke (Reptile in the first film) as Sub-Zero. Stephen Painter and Neill Gorton provided some of the props for the film. J. J. Perry replaced Chris Casamassa as Scorpion, as Casamassa chose to do &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; instead.

The French release of the movie was known as &quot;Mortal Kombat: Destruction Finale&quot; (&quot;Final Destruction&quot;), while the Italian release was titled &quot;Mortal Kombat: Distruzione Totale&quot; (&quot;Total Destruction&quot;).

Thai actor and martial artist Tony Jaa was a stunt double for Robin Shou in the film.

==Music==
&quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; is the soundtrack to the film. The Mortal Kombat theme was composed by Praga Khan and Oliver Adams. The soundtrack was released on October 28, 1997, by TVT Records.

Though this being not mentioned, &quot;Megalomaniac&quot; appears in its single edit (shortened to 4:19 while it lasts 6:07 in its complete version), and &quot;Fire&quot; appears in a slightly shortened version (cut to 3:14 while its single and album versions last 3:31).

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; was released on November 21, 1997, and its opening weekend take was $16 million, enough for a number-one debut at the box office. It grossed $35 million domestically and made $51.3 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, of 53 reviews were positive, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critics consensus states, &quot;With its shallow characters, low budget special effects, and mindless fight scenes, &quot;Mortal Kombat - Annihilation&quot; offers minimal plot development and manages to underachieve the low bar set by its predecessor.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 11/100, based on 12 critics, indicating an &quot;overwhelming dislike.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Jason Gibner of Allmovie wrote, &quot;Whereas the first film was a guilty schlock pleasure, this sequel is an exercise in the art of genuinely beautiful trash cinema.&quot; Marjorie Baumgarten of the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; opined that it was &quot;nothing more than a perpetual chain of elaborately choreographed fight sequences that ... are linked together by the most flimsy and laughable of plot elements.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;D−&quot; rating, calling it &quot;abysmal&quot; and &quot;incoherent.&quot; R.L. Shaffer of IGN wrote in 2011: &quot;&quot;Mortal Kombat: Annihilation&quot; is a bad movie. No way around it. Over the years, however, it has evolved into a cult hit of sorts, playing as an unintentional comedy – a spoof of the early video game movies and their painfully obvious cash-in mentality.&quot;

In separate 2012 interviews, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creators Ed Boon and John Tobias selected &quot;Annihilation&quot; as their personal worst moments in the history of their work on the franchise.

In an interview for Luke Owen’s book, &quot;Lights, Camera, Game Over&quot;, producer Lawrence Kasanoff revealed the film was released unfinished: &quot;I&#x27;m telling you the effects in that movie are not the final effects. I never anticipated that someone would take the movie and go, &#x27;it&#x27;s good enough&#x27;. We weren&#x27;t done. We never finished that movie. But the studio said, &#x27;we don’t care&#x27;. We sacrificed quality for business.&quot;

==Other media==

===Novelization===
A novelization of the film was written by Jerome Preisler, published by Tor Books.

===Canceled sequel===
Shou&#x27;s original contract was a three-picture deal, and Threshold Entertainment&#x27;s production on a second sequel was initially scheduled to commence shortly after the release of &quot;Annihilation&quot;, but was shelved due to &quot;Annihilation&#x27;s&quot; poor reception and disappointing box office performance. Attempts to produce a third film remained stuck in development hell, with numerous script rewrites, and storyline, cast and crew changes. A November 2001 poll on the official &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; website hosted by Threshold asked fans which characters they believed would die in a third film.

The 2005 destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina greatly affected one of the planned shooting locations. In June 2009, a bankruptcy court lawsuit saw producer Kasanoff suing Midway Games while mentioning that a third film was in the works. Warner Bros. (which became the parent company of New Line Cinema in 2008, after over a decade of both operating as separate divisions of Time Warner) ended up purchasing most of Midway&#x27;s assets, including &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. Warner Bros. released the rebooted film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; in 2021.

<text>The Interceptor multi-threat body armor system (IBA) is a bullet-resistant body armor system that was used by the United States Armed Forces during the 2000s, with some limited usage into the mid-2010s. IBA and its design replaced the older standardized fragmentation protective Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT) body armor system that was designed in the late 1970s and introduced in the early 1980s.

The IBA system consists of its core component: the outer tactical vest (OTV), which can optionally be worn with a throat protector, groin protector, and biceps (or deltoid) protector. The latter three auxiliary protectors are removable from the main vest, which can be worn alone.

IBA was designed in the late 1990s as a replacement for the PASGT vest and the essentially-improvised ISAPO supplemental armor plate carrier, a combination widely criticized by US troops for its immense weight. It comes in a variety of color schemes and camouflage patterns depending on who the vest was produced for. It was used by most of the U.S. military&#x27;s branches during much of the 2000s, and was even seeing limited use as late as 2015 among some National Guard units.

Beginning in 2007 the Improved Outer Tactical Vest began to replace the OTVs in the United States Army&#x27;s service and since then it has been mostly replaced in its inventory, with the exception of a few OTVs still in service with the Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve; however, both the OTV and the newer IOTV are being replaced by the Modular Scalable Vest. The U.S. Marine Corps has replaced the OTV with the Modular Tactical Vest (MTV) and Scalable Plate Carrier (SPC), although IBA is still used by the U.S. Navy for sailors aboard its warships as of 2017 and by the U.S. Army Reserve as of 2018. Though IBA has been mostly replaced in U.S. military service, it is still used by the militaries of some other countries that have diplomatic relations with the U.S., such as Ukraine, Iraq, and Moldova. As such, the OTV, which has been in production since the late 1990s, is scheduled to be produced by the U.S. until 2020, for sale to foreign customers.

==Overview==

===Basic system===
The IBA system consists of an Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) and two Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) ballistic plates. The OTV features a carrier shell, and three main (flexible) ballistic panel inserts (front left and front right panels, and a rear back panel), which are made with a finely woven Kevlar KM2 fiber. These two parts of the vest are both bullet and heat resistant and offer protection similar to the earlier PASGT flak jacket. The soft ballistic panels are produced in five different sizes (S-XXL), which are installed into their respective pocket on the OTV carrier shell.

The Interceptor armor also has a PALS webbing grid on the front of the vest which accommodate the same type of pockets used in the modular lightweight load-carrying equipment (MOLLE) backpack/carry vest system. This allows a soldier to tailor-fit his MOLLE and body armor system. While not specifically designed for it, the loops can also easily attach all-purpose lightweight individual carrying equipment (ALICE)-based equipment, as well as many pieces of civilian-made tactical gear, and also features a large handle on the back just below the collar which can be used to drag a wounded person to safety in an emergency.

Originally the entire IBA system weighed , with the large vest weighing , and two plate inserts weighing each. This is much lighter than the previous Ranger Body Armor fielded in Somalia which weighed , as well as the PASGT/ISAPO combination, which weighed even more.

Due to the increased dangers of improvised explosive devices, newer versions of the vital plates and components have been developed. The Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPIs) and Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBIs) have become available, along with the Deltoid and Axillary Protector System (DAPS). These new systems are becoming the standard for forward deployed troops. The E-SAPI plates offer increased protection from 7.62mm armor-piercing ammunition. The ESBIs is an attachable MOLLE ballistic panel with a pouch for a 8x6 side-SAPI, for protection of the side of the torso/under the arm. DAPS consists of two ambidextrous modular components, the Deltoid (upper arm) Protector and the Axillary (underarm) Protector, and provides additional protection from fragmentary and projectiles to the upper arm and underarm areas. With the OTV, E-SAPI plates (), ESBIs (), DAPS () and with the neck, throat and groin protectors installed the armor is significantly heavier at .

===Additional components===

To increase overall protection, separate accessories can be added to the OTV:
* Collar device that is divided in two parts, a neck and collar protector and a throat protector
* Groin protector.

The MOLLE II&#x27;s Fighting Load Carrier component can be donned over an OTV to increase magazine and ease equipment carrying capacity, though it is not part of the IBA system proper.

With the need for additional accessories to protect troops, some were produced for the ground:
* Deltoid and axillary protection system (DAPS, pauldrons).
* Side plate carriers
* Back extender
* Upper Legs protector, a kind of kevlar short
* Lower Extremity Body Armor (LEBA)
* Combat diapers (for example the &quot;Tier 2 Pelvic Protection System&quot; that was issued to U.S. Marines in Afghanistan)

===Ballistic plates===
The Interceptor vest was tested to stop a 9×19mm 124-grain FMJ bullet at with minimal backface deformation, and it has a V-50 of roughly . This means that the bullet in question must travel faster than for it to have more than a 50% chance of penetration. (An unlikely prospect, given the muzzle velocity of a typical 9mm handgun or submachine gun). The Interceptor cannot, however, be called a Level III-A vest, since military standards do not require protection against heavy .44 Magnum ammunition. The vest will stop lower velocity fragments and has removable neck, throat, shoulder, extended back and groin protection.

Additionally, two ceramic plates may be added to the front and back of the vest, with each capable of stopping up to three hits from the round marked on the plate. For SAPI, this is a caliber of up to 7.62×51mm M80 FMJ. For ESAPI, this is a caliber of up to 30-06 M2 AP. This performance is only guaranteed when backed by the Interceptor vest, or any other soft armor which meets military requirements for protection. SAPI and ESAPI are the most technically advanced body armor fielded by the U.S. military, and are constructed of boron carbide ceramic with a Spectra shield backing that breaks down projectiles and halts their momentum.
==History==

===Development and production===
Materials for the Interceptor vest were developed by DARPA in the 1990s, and a contract for production was awarded to DHB Industries&#x27; Point Blank Body Armor, Inc., by the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center. IBA was announced on April 13, 1998, and the contract to manufacture IBA was awarded to an Oakland Park, Florida-based company under a five-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract in late July 1998, and the body armor went into full production later that year.

In 2007, news reports were being issued on the lack of protection from hard and soft plated body armor from lethal rounds. Due to the coverage of these reports, comparative studies were done on the effectiveness of U.S. Military body armor, included IBA. IBA&#x27;s performance was deemed inferior compared to other body armor designs and published on the news. The large coverage from this report led to Dean G. Popps, the Acting United States Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, to direct all first article testing (FAT) of IBA to the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC). The command headquarters are located at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) as a part of the Army Research Laboratory (ARL).

The Interceptor body armor components come in a number of variants. Camouflage patterns include:
* &quot;M81&quot; U.S. woodland, used by the U.S. Navy and foreign militaries
* Three-color &quot;Desert Camouflage Uniform&quot; desert (less common than woodland and coyote brown)
* The Universal Camouflage Pattern, used by the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force, largely superseded by the IOTV and its components
Solid colors include:
* Coyote brown (referred to by the DoD as &quot;coyote tan&quot;)
* Grey, used by the Afghan National Police service.

The original Interceptor outer tactical vest (OTV) variant first began to be issued to the U.S. Armed Forces in 2000, though by September 2001 relatively few had actually been fielded. The first OTV carriers were first produced in woodland camouflage pattern (one initial contractor for the early OTVs was Point Blank, Inc). Quickly, a coyote-brown variant was made for the USMC, seeing use during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Marines used OTVs in both woodland and coyote-brown camouflages in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the U.S. Army, the Woodland camouflage pattern was then superseded by the 3-color Desert Combat pattern, followed by the Universal Camouflage Pattern.

Later versions of the OTV made in the mid-to-late 2000s and the 2010s feature more PALS loops on the front and back of the OTV component, hook-and-loop &quot;Velcro&quot; fasteners on the front for nametapes and rank patches, whereas older models from the early 2000s did not. Said later version is commonly referred to as the &quot;second generation&quot; OTV.

As part of U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s $87 billion package for ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, $300 million was earmarked for body armor. A complete Interceptor system costs $1,585. The Interceptor system&#x27;s component ceramic plates currently cost about $500 each.

OTVs are still being made today, primarily for the U.S. Army, which then in turn sells them to foreign countries and international customers under the &quot;Foreign Military Sales&quot; (FMS) program. They have been made by convict labor provided the UNICOR company since 2008 and are scheduled to be made until at least April 2020. OTVs in the woodland and desert camouflage patterns along with coyote brown color scheme were being made as late as early 2014.

===Replacement===
====U.S. Army====
On May 10, 2006, the U.S. Army announced it was holding an open competition for companies to design an entirely new generation of body armor &quot;to improve on and replace&quot; the Interceptor Body Armor&#x27;s vest component. The Army said it wanted ideas from companies by May 31. Congressional investigators reportedly reviewed the Pentagon&#x27;s entire body armor program, including the OTV. Investigators expressed concern that the vests might not be adequate to protect troops.

Aside from replacing the SAPI vital plates with the improved E-SAPI plates, the body armor vests have also been redesigned, improved and enhanced with the introduction of the Improved Outer Tactical Vest, or &quot;IOTV&quot; (which began to be issued to ground combat units from mid-to-late 2007), in the U.S. Army.

The OTV along with IOTV and SPCS will eventually be replaced by the Modular Scalable Vest.

====U.S. Marine Corps====
After initially using IBA as their main body armor system, the U.S. Marine Corps developed a completely new armor system, the Modular Tactical Vest, which was their primary body armor system in Iraq. On September 25, 2006, the Marine Corps announced that Protective Products International won a contract for 60,000 new Modular Tactical Vests (MTV) to replace the Interceptor OTV vests. The MTV provides greater coverage, superior weight distribution, and additional features including as a quick-release system. Some U.S. Navy ground force personnel (such as seabees and hospital corpsmen) use the Modular Tactical Vest. Other Navy personnel on Individual Augmentee assignments use the Army&#x27;s body armor systems.

Not adapted for the mountainous environment of Afghanistan, the Modular Tactical Vest (MTV) was replaced by the Scalable Plate Carrier (SPC), a lighter alternative, which is their primary body armor system for Afghanistan.

Since January 2009, the U.S. Marine Corps is seeking for replacements for both MTV and SPC that are commonly issued. The MTV has received top ratings by many U.S. Marines; although a few Marines have complained about minor elements of it and an updated version will soon be released which deals with these elements. The Improved Modular Tactical Vest (IMTV) and Improved Scalable Plate Carrier (ISPC) are the new models. &quot;The IMTV will be the main body armor system for Marines, the Corps plans to order about 70,000 of the improved plate carriers, far more than the estimated 10,000 to 14,000 plate carriers in use today&quot;.

==Effectiveness==
===Discussion===
Body armor is always a compromise: mobility and comfort (and with it speed and stamina) are inevitably sacrificed to some degree when greater protection is achieved. This is a point of contention in the U.S. armed forces, with some favoring less armor in order to maintain mobility and others wanting as much protection as is practical. Troops who primarily ride in vehicles generally want the highest practical level of protection from IEDs and ambushes, while dismounted infantry often make the case that impaired mobility can prove just as fatal as inadequate armor.

===Controversies===

Most OTVs were made in the &quot;M81&quot; U.S. woodland camouflage pattern initially. As a result, during the Iraq War prior to the adoption of the Army Combat Uniform, most U.S. Army soldiers in Iraq were wearing woodland-patterned OTVs atop Desert Camouflage Uniforms, resulting in them being easier to spot from a distance in a desert environment like Iraq.

On 4 May 2005 the U.S. Marine Corps recalled 5,277 Interceptor OTVs made by DHB&#x27;s Point Blank unit after news reports about the vests&#x27; inability to stop 9 mm bullets. In November 2005, the Marine Corps ordered 10,342 Interceptor outer tactical vests pulled from the operating forces after media reports indicated some samples tested by the manufacturer and by the U.S. Army&#x27;s Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland failed to fully comply with ballistics standards.

A U.S. Marine Corps forensic study obtained by DefenseWatch criticizes the Interceptor OTV body armor system. The report says: &quot;As many as 42% of the Marine casualties who died from isolated torso injuries could have been prevented with improved protection in the areas surrounding the plated areas of the vest. Nearly 23% might have benefited from protection along the mid-axillary line of the lateral chest. Another 15% died from impacts through the unprotected shoulder and upper arm.&quot;

===Alternatives===
Private purchase of commercial body armor for combat use by soldiers is not authorized by the U.S. Army. A spokesman voiced concerns in 2004 about armor that had not been &quot;tested, certified or approved&quot; by the Army. In 2005, the DoD, under severe pressure from Congress after the recalls, authorized a one-time $1,000 reimbursement to soldiers who had purchased civilian body armor and other gear. In 2006 they gave orders not to wear anything but military issued body armor because of fears that inadequate armor could be purchased, mainly body armor that had inadequate blunt force trauma protection.

<doc id="485550" wikidata="Q13272" url="?curid=485550" title="Slavey language">
<text>Slavey (; also Slave, Slavé) is a group of Athabaskan languages and a dialect continuum spoken amongst the Dene peoples of Canada in the Northwest Territories – or central Denendeh – where it also has official status. The languages are primarily written using a modified Latin script, with some using Canadian Aboriginal syllabics. In their own languages, these languages are referred to as: Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́ (spoken by the Sahtu Dene), K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́ (the Hare Dene dialect) and Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́ (the Mountain dialect) in the North, and Dené Dháh (primarily by the Dene Tha&#x27; in Alberta), Dene Yatıé or Dene Zhatıé in the South.

==North Slavey and South Slavey ==
North Slavey is spoken by the Sahtu (North Slavey) people in the Mackenzie District along the middle Mackenzie River from Tulita (Fort Norman) north, around Great Bear Lake, and in the Mackenzie Mountains of the Canadian territory of Northwest Territories. The dialect has around 800 speakers.

Northern Slavey is an amalgamation of three separate &quot;dialects&quot;: 
* K’ashógot’įne () Goxedǝ́: Hare, spoken by the - &quot;Rabbitskin People&quot; or - &quot;Great Hare People&quot;, referring to their dependence on the varying hare for food and clothing, also called or 
* Sahtúgot’įné () Yatı̨́: Bear Lake, spoken by the or - &quot;Bear Lake People&quot;, also known as 
* Shíhgot’įne () Yatı̨́: Mountain, spoken by the or - &quot;Mountain People&quot; or &quot;Mountain Indians&quot;, also called or - &quot;People of the west&quot;, so called because they lived in the mountains west of the other Slavey groups, between the Mackenzie Mountains and the Mackenzie River, from the Redstone River to the Mountain River

South Slavey ( or ) is spoken by the Slavey people, who were also known as - &quot;People Dwelling in the Shelter&quot;, in the region of Great Slave Lake, upper Mackenzie River ( - &quot;Big River&quot;) and its drainage, in the District of Mackenzie, northeast Alberta, and northwest British Columbia.

Some communities are bilingual, with the children learning Slavey at home and English when they enter school. Still other communities are monolingual in Slavey The dialect has around 1,000 speakers.

&quot;Alternative names:&quot; Slavi, Slave, Dené, Mackenzian

The division of Slavey dialects is based largely on the way each one pronounces the old Proto-Athapaskan sounds *dz *ts *ts’ *s and *z.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
The consonant inventories in the dialects of Slavey differ considerably. The table above lists the 30 consonants common to most or all varieties. Hare lacks aspirated affricates (on red background), which have lenited into fricatives, whereas Mountain lacks (on blue). In addition, for some speakers of Hare, an alveolar flap has developed into a separate phoneme. Prenasalized stops may appear in Slavey proper.

The most pronounced difference is however the realization of a series of consonants that varies greatly in their place of articulation:
In Slavey proper, these are dental affricates and fricatives; comparative Athabaskan work reveals this to be the oldest sound value. Mountain has labials, with the voiceless stop coinciding with pre-existing . Bearlake has labialized velars, but has lenited the voiced fricative to coincide with pre-existing . The most complicated situation is found in Hare, where the plain stop is a labialized velar, the ejective member is replaced by a sequence, the aspirated affricate has turned into a fricative , and both the voiceless and voiced fricatives have been lenited to .

====Phonological processes====

The following phonological and phonetic statements apply to all four dialects of Slavey.

* Unaspirated obstruents are either voiceless or weakly voiced, e.g.
** → or 
* Aspirated obstruents are strongly aspirated.
* Ejectives are strongly ejective.
* When occurring between vowels, ejectives are often voiced, e.g.
** → or 
* is usually strongly velarized, i.e. .
* Velar obstruents are palatalized before front vowels, e.g.
** → 
* Velar fricatives may be labialized before round vowels.
** The voiceless fricative is usually labialized, e.g.
** The voiced fricative is optionally labialized and may additionally be deaffricated e.g.
*** → or or 
* Velar stops are also labialized before round vowels. These labialized velars are not as heavily rounded as labial velars (which occur in Bearlake and Hare), e.g.
** → 
* Lateral affricates are generally alveolar, but sometimes velar, i.e.
** → or 
** → or 
** → or 
* may be velar or glottal, i.e.
** → or 

===Vowels===
* a 
* e or when followed by a back vowel
* ə or 
* i or in syllable onset
* o 
* u 
* nasal vowels are marked with an ogonek accent, e.g. 
*Vowel length is distributed as /VV/ in the dialects of Bearlake, Slavey and Mountain.
* South Slavey does not have the vowel.

=== Tone ===

Slavey has two tones:

* high
* low

In Slavey orthography, high tone is marked with an acute accent, and low tone is unmarked.

Tones are both lexical and grammatical.

Lexical: &#x27;along&#x27; vs. &#x27;rabbit&#x27;

===Syllable structure===
Slavey morphemes have underlying syllable structures in the stems: CV, CVC, CVnC, V, and VC. The prefixes of the stem occur as Cv, CVC, VC, CV, and C.

==Writing system==
Slavey alphabet (1973)

Tone is indicated with an acute accent and the ogonek indicates nasalization.

North Slavey alphabet
South Slavey alphabet
==Morphology==
Slavey, like many Athabascan languages, has a very specific morpheme order in the verb in which the stem must come last. The morpheme order is shown in the following chart.

A Slavey verb must minimally have positions 13 and 14 to be proper. Here are some examples:

==Person, number and gender==

===Gender===
Slavey marks gender by means of prefixation on the verb theme. There are three different genders, one of which is unmarked; the other two are marked by prefixes [go-] and [de-]. However, only certain verb themes allow gender prefixes.

[go-] is used for nouns which mark location in either time or space. Some examples of these areal nouns are house (kǫ́é), land (déh), river (deh), and winter (xay). The gender pronoun can be a direct object, an oblique object or a possessor.



[de-] marks wood, leaves and branches. This gender is optional: some speakers use it and others do not.



===Number===
Slavey marks number in the subject prefixes in position 12. The dual is marked by the prefix łéh- (Sl)/łe- (Bl)/le- (Hr).

:&quot;ni̒łe̒gehtthe&quot;
:&#x27;They two got stuck in a narrow passage.&#x27;
The plural is marked with the prefix go-.

:&quot;Dahgogehthe&quot;
:&#x27;They dance.&#x27;

:&quot;ʔeha̒goni̒dhe&quot;
:&#x27;We go for meat.&#x27;

===Person===
Slavey has first, second, third, and fourth person. When in position 12, acting as a subject, first-person singular is /h-/, second-person singular is /ne-/, first-person dual/plural is /i̒d-/, and second person plural is marked by /ah-/. Third person is not marked in this position. When occurring as a direct or indirect object, the pronoun prefixes change and fourth person becomes relevant.

* First-person singular takes se-.
* Second-person singular takes ne-
* Third person is marked by be-/me-
* Fourth person is marked by ye-

==Classification==
Like most Athabaskan languages, Slavey has a multitude of classifications. There are five basic categories that describe the nature of an object. Some of these categories are broken up further.

==Tense and aspect==

===Tense===

Slavey has only one structural tense: future. Other tenses can be indicated periphrastically.

An immediate future can be formed by the &quot;de-&quot; inceptive (position 9) plus &quot;y-.&quot;

===Aspect===
Slavey has two semantic aspects: perfective and imperfective.

The perfective is represented in position 11:

The perfective can also be used with a past tense marker to indicate that at the point of reference, which is sometime in the past, the event was completed 

The imperfective indicates that the reference time precedes the end of the event time:

==Word order==
Slavey is a verb-final language. The basic word order is SOV.

Oblique objects precede the direct object.

==Case==
Slavey has no case markings. To differentiate between subject, direct object, and oblique objects, word order is used. The subject will be the first noun phrase, and the direct object will occur right before the verb. The oblique objects are controlled by postpositions.

==Possessives==
Possessive pronoun prefixes are found in Slavey. These pronouns have the same forms as the direct and oblique object pronouns. The prefixes are listed below with examples.

===&quot;se-&quot; first-person singular===

:&quot;bá&quot; &#x27;mitts&#x27;
:&quot;sebáré&quot; &#x27;my mitts&#x27;

:&quot;mbeh&quot; &#x27;knife&#x27;
:&quot;sembehé&quot; &#x27;my knife&#x27;

===&quot;ne-&quot; second-person singular===

:&quot;ts&#x27;ah&quot; &#x27;hat&#x27;
:&quot;net&#x27;saré&quot; &#x27;your (SG) hat&#x27;

:&quot;tl&#x27;uh&quot; &#x27;rope&#x27;
:&quot;netl&#x27;ulé&quot; &#x27;your (SG) rope&#x27;

===&quot;be-/me-&quot; third-person singular===


===&quot;ye-&quot; fourth person===
===&quot;ʔe-&quot; unspecified possessor===

:&quot;ʔelįé&quot; &#x27;someone&#x27;s dog&#x27;

===&quot;naxe-/raxe-&quot; first-person plural, second-person plural.===

:&quot;ts&#x27;éré&quot; &#x27;blanket&#x27;
:&quot;naxets&#x27;éré&quot; &#x27;our blanket, your (PL) blanket&#x27;

===&quot;ku-/ki-/go-&quot; third-person plural===


==Clauses==

===Conjunctions===

There are both coordinating and subordinating conjunctions in Slavey.

====Coordinating====

=====&quot;gots&#x27;éh&quot; &quot;and, and then&quot;=====


=====&quot;kúlú, kólí, kúú, kóó, ékóó, góa&quot; &quot;but&quot;=====


====Subordinating conjunctions====

=====&quot;ʔenįdé, nįdé, ndé, néh&quot; &quot;if, when, whenever&quot;=====


=====&quot;-were&quot; &quot;before&quot;=====
=====&quot;-ts&#x27;ę&quot; &quot;since, from&quot;=====
=====-&quot;hé&quot; &quot;because, so&quot;=====


===Relative clauses===

There are three important parts to a relative clause. There is the head, which is the noun that is modified or delimited. The second part is the restricting sentence. The sentence modifies the head noun. The last part is the complementizer.

==Status==

North and South Slavey are recognized as official languages of the Northwest Territories; they may be used in court and in debates and proceedings of the Northwest Territories legislature. However, unlike English and French, the government only publishes laws and documents in North and South Slavey if the legislature requests it, and these documents are not authoritative.

In 2015, a Slavey woman named Andrea Heron challenged the territorial government over its refusal to permit the ʔ character, representing the Slavey glottal stop, in her daughter&#x27;s name, Sakaeʔah, despite Slavey languages being official in the NWT. The territory argued that territorial and federal identity documents were unable to accommodate the character. Heron had registered the name with a hyphen instead of the ʔ when her daughter was born, but when Sakaeʔah was 6, Ms. Heron joined a challenge by a Chipewyan woman named Shene Catholique-Valpy regarding the same character in her own daughter&#x27;s name, Sahaiʔa.

Also in 2015, the University of Victoria launched a language revitalization program in the NWT, pairing learners of indigenous languages including Slavey with fluent speakers. The program requires 100 hours of conversation with the mentor with no English allowed, as well as sessions with instructors in Fort Providence.

==In popular culture==
Slavey was the native language spoken by the fictional band in the Canadian television series &quot;North of 60&quot;. Nick Sibbeston, a former Premier of the Northwest Territories, was a Slavey language and culture consultant for the show.

<doc id="485553" wikidata="Q3430597" url="?curid=485553" title="Richard Hanson (Canadian politician)">
<text>Richard Burpee Hanson, (March 20, 1879 – July 14, 1948) was a Canadian politician who served as interim leader of the Conservative Party from May 14, 1940, until November 11, 1941.

==Early life and education==
Hanson was born on March 20, 1879, in Bocabec, Charlotte County, New Brunswick, to parents Richard B. and Hannah Hanson. He was educated in public schools in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, Mount Allison University, and Dalhousie Law School.

==Career==
Hanson was admitted to the Bar of New Brunswick in November 1902 and was created a King&#x27;s Counsel by the Government of New Brunswick in January 1917. From 1918 to 1920, he was Mayor of Fredericton.

First elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for the New Brunswick electoral district of York—Sunbury in the 1921 general election, Hanson served continuously in the House of Commons of Canada until his defeat in the 1935 election. He was appointed to the Cabinet of R. B. Bennett in 1934 as Minister of Trade and Commerce.

In the 1940 election, he returned to Parliament despite the poor showing of the Conservatives in that election and the personal defeat of Robert Manion. Since Manion resigned two months after the election, the Conservative caucus chose Hanson as interim leader and he served as Conservative Party Leader until Arthur Meighen was appointed the party&#x27;s new leader in November 1941. As Meighen did not have a seat in the House (and then failed to win a seat through a by-election), Hanson continued as Leader of the Opposition until 1943.

==Death and legacy==
Hanson died on July 14, 1948, due to illness. The University of New Brunswick hands out the Richard Burpee Hanson Prize to a Faculty of Arts male student with the highest grades in English and History in the Sophomore level.

== Archives ==
There is a Richard Burpee Hanson fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

<text>70 Pine Street (formerly known as the 60 Wall Tower, Cities Service Building, and American International Building) is a 67-story, residential skyscraper in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City, United States. Designed by the firm of Clinton &amp; Russell, Holton &amp; George in the Art Deco style, 70 Pine Street was built from 1930 to 1932 as an office building. The structure was originally named for its original tenant, the energy conglomerate Cities Service Company (later Citgo), and was Lower Manhattan&#x27;s tallest building and the world&#x27;s third-tallest building upon its completion.

70 Pine Street occupies a trapezoidal lot on Pearl Street between Pine and Cedar Streets. It features a brick, limestone, and gneiss facade with numerous setbacks. The building contains an extensive program of ornamentation, including the Cities Service Company&#x27;s triangular logo and solar motifs. The interior features included escalators at the base and double-deck elevators linking the tower&#x27;s floors. A three-story penthouse, intended for Cities Service&#x27;s founder Henry Latham Doherty, was instead used as a public observatory.

70 Pine Street&#x27;s construction was funded through a public offering of stock, rather than a mortgage loan. Despite having been built during the Great Depression, the building was profitable enough that it broke even by 1936, and 90 percent of its space was occupied five years later. The American International Group (AIG) bought the building in 1976, and it was acquired by another firm in 2009 after AIG went bankrupt. The building and its first floor interior were designated as official New York City landmarks in June 2011, and the structure was converted to residential use in 2016.

== Site ==
70 Pine Street is in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City, United States. It sits on a land lot bounded by Pine Street to the south, Pearl Street to the east, and Cedar Street to the north. The roughly trapezoidal site covers , measuring on Pine and Cedar Streets by on Pearl Street. The terrain slopes downward to the east, toward Pearl Street, so that there is an upper lobby (accessed from Pine Street) and a lower lobby (accessed from Pearl Street). Neighboring buildings include 56 Pine Street and the Down Town Association building to the northwest; 90–94 Maiden Lane to the north; 48 Wall Street to the southwest; and 60 Wall Street to the south.

== Architecture ==
70 Pine Street is a 67-story building rising . The roof is tall while the top story is high. Like its contemporaries, 70 Pine Street has a Gothic-like spire-topped appearance. The architectural firm Clinton &amp; Russell, Holton &amp; George designed 70 Pine Street in the Art Deco style; the structure was the last large commission by these architects. Of that firm&#x27;s principals, Thomas J. George was likely the most involved with the design. James Stewart &amp; Company was the general contractor, Taylor Fichter Steel Construction was the structural engineer, and John M. Parrish was the project&#x27;s general superintendent.

The building was constructed as part of an ongoing skyscraper race in New York City, which resulted in the city having the world&#x27;s tallest building from 1908 to 1974. When completed, 70 Pine Street was the third-tallest building in the world, after the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building in Midtown Manhattan. The building exceeded 40 Wall Street, the Manhattan Company&#x27;s building, by to be Lower Manhattan&#x27;s tallest building. It was the last skyscraper to be built in Lower Manhattan prior to World War II, and was the tallest building in Lower Manhattan until the 1970s, when the World Trade Center was completed. With the collapse of the World Trade Center in the September 11 attacks, it regained the status of the tallest Lower Manhattan building until the completion of the new 4 World Trade Center in 2013.

=== Form ===

70 Pine Street contains numerous setbacks on its exterior. Though setbacks in New York City skyscrapers were mandated by the 1916 Zoning Resolution in order to allow light and air to reach the streets below, they later became a defining feature of the Art Deco style. To maximize rentable space while also complying with the 1916 Zoning Resolution, the setbacks are placed at regular intervals, forming a diagonal line. The setbacks on the northern and southern elevations, and those on the western and eastern elevations, alternate with each other.

The building&#x27;s 11th through 31st floors gradually step back from the base. The building&#x27;s shaft begins above the 32nd floor and rises to the 54th or 56th floor, where the corners of the shaft taper off. The intermediate levels contain smaller setbacks, which were used as private terraces for the offices on the respective floors. There were multiple setbacks on each side, so the upper floors contained up to 20 sides. The top stories are one-fourth the size of the lowest stories.

Above the 67th-floor observation deck is the building&#x27;s spire, composed of a glass lantern rising , topped by a stainless steel pinnacle extending another . The spire rises and weighs . The author Dirk Stichweh characterized the spire as giving the impression of a mountain peak covered with snow. The spire had a beacon, which was described as being &quot;visible for 200 miles at sea and inland&quot;, though in reality the beacon could only be seen from away. W. Parker Chase, writing in 1932, characterized the spire as being &quot;almost sensational in its &#x27;differentness&#x27;&quot;.

=== Facade ===
The entrance portals and lower-story windows are lavishly decorated. The lower stories of the facade are covered with Indiana Limestone, placed above a water table of Minnesota granite. Red-and-black Morton gneiss wraps the ground floor. The upper stories are clad with four shades of buff-colored brick, which darken toward the building&#x27;s peak. Each setback is surrounded by a parapet with a limestone coping. An extensive lighting system highlighted the building&#x27;s features at night, consisting of 400-watt lamps. The presence of the lamps was influenced by Cities Service&#x27;s role as an energy provider. An early publicist for 70 Pine Street said that Cities Service founder Henry Latham Doherty was personally involved in the structure&#x27;s design, and that &quot;he insisted on dignity with beauty, to the absolute avoidance of the garish, the flamboyant, and the over colorful.&quot; Doherty wanted the building to appear &quot;exclusive, rich, yet simple and even a little severe&quot;.

70 Pine Street was one of the first buildings to use aluminum extensively on its facade. Cliff Parkhurst of the Parkhurst Organization designed the aluminum ornamentation of 70 Pine Street. These ornamental features include reliefs above each set of entrance doors; spandrels with sharp arrises above the lower-story windows; and a ventilation grille on Cedar Street. The reliefs above the doors are designed with motifs of butterflies and sunflowers, which appear as an abstract pattern from a distance. In addition, there were 6,000 windows, ten million bricks, of marble, and of steel used in 70 Pine Street&#x27;s construction. The black and pink marble in the building was transported from Minnesota and Tennessee.

==== Entrances ====

The building has five entrances in total. Four primary entrances, two on Pine Street and two on Cedar Street, which all lead to the main lobby. Another entrance on Pearl Street, which was formerly located under the Third Avenue elevated line, is more simply designed and leads to a lobby in the lower level. All of these streets are narrower than the typical street in Manhattan: Pine Street is wide while Cedar Street is wide. Because of the slope of the terrain, the western entrances are at the same level at the street, and the eastern entrances are accessed by short flights of steps rising from the street. All four entrances are designed with Art Deco patterns.

The eastern entrances on Pine and Cedar Streets are near the centers of these elevations; they consist of large four-story portals with stepped arches. Both arches are divided by a limestone pillar that contains a freestanding limestone relief of 70 Pine Street. These pillars, each , may have been designed by Rene Paul Chambellan and were fairly accurate in their detailing. Architectural critic Robert A. M. Stern wrote that 70 Pine Street&#x27;s reliefs &quot;surveyed the crowds of workers as a carved Madonna would bless the pilgrims of a Gothic cathedral.&quot; There were three metal doors to either side of the pillars. Above the doors were four tiers of sash windows; the lowest such tier was originally composed of glass louvers, which reduced wind pressure when the doors were being opened, but these were later replaced with glass panes. Along the interior reveals of both portal arches are reliefs containing the triangular logo of Cities Service. Inside each entrance were staircases leading to the upper and lower lobbies.

The western entrances on Pine and Cedar Streets are located near the western end of the building and are two stories tall. Each portal contains two sets of revolving doors.

=== Interior ===
At the time of 70 Pine Street&#x27;s construction, developers had to consider skyscrapers&#x27; profitability in conjunction with height. 70 Pine Street was designed to accommodate between 7,000 and 8,000 employees, more than nearly every other skyscraper at the time. The interior spaces were thus designed with high capacity in mind. The building contains of interior space. When it opened, there was of gross floor area, of which was available for lease. Offices were arranged in a &quot;U&quot; shape, wrapping around the mechanical core on the north, east, and south. The northern and southern elevations of the facade are staggered because of the setbacks, maximizing natural light in each office.

==== Lobby ====
The first-floor lobby is designed in the Art Deco style and are arranged into six hallways. Two of the hallways are long, traveling north to south between the pairs of entrances on Pine and Cedar Streets, while three other hallways are long and travel west to east; there is also a wide central hall. The passages are wide, with the widest section of the lobby near Pine Street, where there is an information booth. The lobby is oriented slightly west, away from the elevated lines that formerly overshadowed Pearl Street, so that the westerly entrances could be located at ground level and so that the sky bridge to 60 Wall Street would be possible. The layout of the lobby allowed visitors to pass from Pine to Cedar Street.

Inside each entrance were retail spaces that faced the first-floor lobby. Four storefronts were located on the southern portion of the lobby. Until the early 2000s, these retail spaces contained such stores as &quot;a drugstore, a bookstore, a tobacconist and a telegraph office&quot;. There are stairs on the southern portion of the lobby near Pine Street, as well as at the eastern portion near Pearl Street; these stairs ascend to the second floor and descend to the basement lobby. There were also escalators between every level from the basement to the sixth floor, near the western entrance on Pine Street.

The basement lobby is a simpler version of the first-floor lobby, serving mainly as a boarding area for the lower decks of 70 Pine Street&#x27;s former double-deck elevators. The upper decks of these elevators were served from the main lobby; the elevators are arranged along the central hall and the northernmost west–east corridor. The elevator doors are designed with Native American motifs, such as zigzags and sunbursts, as well as Cities Service&#x27;s logo. The elevator frames themselves contain stepped arches. One critic said the use of separate elevator lobbies would &quot;cut the possibility of elevator flirtations exactly in half&quot;.

The lobby is decorated with marble walls, plaster ceilings, and aluminum grilles. Despite Doherty&#x27;s desire for &quot;dignity with beauty&quot;, the lobby is highly ornamented with multicolored marbles from Europe, including Roman and golden travertine, Belgian Black, Belgian Grand Antique, Champville, Levanto, and Tinos marbles. Most of the wall area is composed of yellow marble, divided by vertical piers of dark-red marble. The floors are composed of panels of white and pink marble, arranged as in a checkerboard. The ceiling is made of plaster and is supported by large jagged corbels. It is mostly painted white, except for colored bands of relief, which emanate from elements such as the lighting fixtures. Cliff Parkhurst furnished the elaborate metalwork in the lobby. A writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared the building&#x27;s lobby to &quot;something Bernini would have designed if he&#x27;d lived to see the Jazz Age&quot;.

====Other interior spaces====
The basement contained a bank vault with the most advanced security systems available during that era. The basement also included a 400-seat eatery known as the Tower Restaurant, as well as other businesses such as a barber shop, beautician, chiropodist, florist, manicurist, hat cleaner–shoe shiner, sandwich shop, and photostat store. The fourth floor contained a clinic for people who worked in the building. One tenant, boxer Artie McGovern, operated an athletic club on the seventh floor, which was reportedly visited by over a thousand men daily and included a gymnasium, handball and squash courts, ping-pong tables, and golf facilities. On the 29th floor, there was a library filled with law books and documents, which was made available only to tenants. This library had 16,000 volumes and was staffed by a librarian with a bar certification.

Just below the observatory was a conference room with leather paneling. The 62nd through 64th floors contained Cities Service&#x27;s executive offices, which also had exterior terraces. Doherty&#x27;s office on the 61st floor was decorated in light colors and was designed to resemble a living room, with couches, chairs, small tables, and other furniture. Cities Service&#x27;s oval-shaped boardroom occupied almost the entire 64th floor and had leather paneling and high ceilings.

, the skyscraper has several amenities, including an Elite fitness center by New York Sports Club on the lower level, a food market, and several lounges. Since its 2015–2016 conversion, 70 Pine Street includes 612 residential apartments. The residences are arranged as studio apartments or one- or two-bedroom units, and are generally outfitted with wooden floors. Another 132 units are run as hotel rooms by Lyric, a startup company funded by Airbnb. Retail tenants include a gourmet market and a high-end restaurant in the lobby. The building also contains a fitness and recreation center, including a screening room, bowling alley, indoor golf facility, and a game room in the former bank vault in the basement.

====Observation deck====

The top three floors were originally slated to contain Doherty&#x27;s private penthouse apartment. The suite contained a gym and a squash court. Doherty&#x27;s bed was designed on a motorized platform that could slide out onto the terrace. Doherty ultimately never lived in the space.

In July 1932, the private suite opened to the public as an observation deck, which comprised an open-air platform with a enclosed glass solarium on the 66th floor. The deck operated from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day and charged 50 cents for admission, although tenants and Cities Services employees received a 50-percent discount. It was served by a five-passenger elevator that rose through the floor slab and then retracted. The glass solarium contained doors at each of the corners, which were chamfered, as well as on the north and south sides; these doors led to one of six terraces with slate tiles. Decorations from France, Italy, and Spain were used in the observation deck. The deck charged 40 cents for admission in 1939; by comparison, the deck at the Empire State Building cost $1.10 to enter.

During World War II, the attraction was closed to the public because it overlooked the nearby Brooklyn Navy Yard, an active military installation. Until the 1973 construction of the World Trade Center, it was the highest observation deck of any building in Lower Manhattan. The deck was permanently closed to the public before 1975. Afterward, it was used as a private office for AIG&#x27;s employees. In 2019, as part of the building&#x27;s 2010s conversion into residential apartments, James Kent and Jeff Katz turned the top four stories into the fine-dining restaurant SAGA, and on the ground floor Crown Shy, a 120-seat eatery. Crown Shy is an à la carte eatery, where dishes are ordered individually.

=== Mechanical features ===

====Elevators====
There are 24 elevators in total, with six banks of four elevators each in the first-floor lobby. There were eight double-deck elevators, which served alternating floors; six &quot;express&quot; elevators, which ran nonstop from the lobby to serve the upper floors; eight &quot;local&quot; elevators, which served the lower floors; and two freight elevators, which served all floors. All of the elevators were able to serve approximately 10,000 people every hour. In an emergency, it was estimated that the elevators, along with the escalators serving the lower floors, would be able to clear the building in 35 minutes. The elevator doors in the main lobby are ornately designed, resembling those at the Fred F. French Building, 608 Fifth Avenue, and the Chrysler Building. Each elevator door is a double-leaf door made of aluminum, with diamond and trefoil patterns, which were cast in one piece. The elevator doors in the lobbies contain octagonal relief panels sculpted by Chambellan. These reliefs alternately show a woman with an oil lamp and a man with an electric turbine.

Because of 70 Pine Street&#x27;s small lot size, and the setbacks that make the upper floors even smaller, it would have been unprofitable under normal building practices if it were taller than 48 stories. Engineers from Otis Elevator Company told Doherty that double-deck elevators could solve the problem. As such, the company manufactured eight double-deck elevators, marking the first installation of Otis double-deck elevators. The double-deck elevators operated as express elevators, serving the 29th through 60th floors; another separate, single-deck elevator served the top six floors. The lower deck of each elevator served odd-numbered floors, while the upper deck served even-numbered floors. The Cedar Street portion of the first-floor lobby contained elevator banks that only served the building&#x27;s lower floors, while the Pine Street portion contained elevators that served higher floors. During off-peak hours, only the upper deck of each double-deck elevator was used.

The &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; stated that the double-deck elevators, long anticipated by developers, were &quot;permitted by special provision in the new elevator code&quot;. Compared to 11 or 14 standard elevators, the double-deck elevators reportedly saved $200,000 in construction costs and made available an additional , at a time when office space could be rented at an average rate of per year. Columnist Sam Love disagreed, saying that &quot;the odds and the evens in the Cities Service Building will never see each other although they are the nearest neighbors&quot;, referring to the floor numbers. The double-deck elevators were removed in 1972 and replaced with single-story cabs. The double-deck elevators had reportedly been unpopular because the lower lobby entrance was not completed, and a proposed subway entrance was not opened. The Citigroup Center adopted the same idea in the 1970s, becoming possibly the first building in New York City after 70 Pine Street to have double-deck elevators.

==== Other features ====

At the 16th floor, a sky bridge connected 70 Pine Street with 60 Wall Street. There was another connection, a tunnel, between the two buildings. The connections enabled 70 Pine Street to initially claim a Wall Street address, which was perceived as more distinguished than a regular address in the Financial District. The bridge was destroyed in 1975 when the original 60 Wall Street building was demolished to make way for the current, larger building. At the time, it was one of a few sky bridges in the city. In 1979, a replacement bridge was built, connecting the sixth and seventh floors of 70 Pine Street to the seventh and eighth floors of 72 Wall Street.

When it opened, 70 Pine Street featured escalators between its first through sixth floors; the escalators operated in the peak direction, running upstairs in the morning and downstairs in the afternoon. The escalators reportedly enabled everyone on the basement through sixth floors to evacuate within 10 minutes. At the time of 70 Pine Street&#x27;s completion, these stories housed Cities Service&#x27;s clerical staff, and studies had shown that escalators occupied less space than elevators between these stories. This was one of the first uses of escalators in a major office building. Though the Empire State Building had also included escalators between its lobby and mezzanine, 70 Pine Street was modeled on the layout of a department store, the first office building in New York City to be designed in this manner. These escalators were hidden behind a false marble wall.

70 Pine Street also included a hot-water heating system, which replaced the standard boiler systems used in many contemporary skyscrapers. High-velocity pumps propelled water to radiators beneath the windows in each office. Each radiator contained movable louvers that could control the heat in each office. During the winter, a system of chilled water pipes cooled the lowest six stories. The building also had a &quot;unit ventilating system&quot;, which occupied spaces over the radiators and inside the walls, providing ventilation without any dust or noise. Above each radiator were fans, which drew in air from either indoors or outdoors; filtered and warmed the air; and distributed the warm air throughout each office using ceiling ducts. This eliminated the need for fan rooms, which typically occupied large amounts of space, and also allowed tenants to close their windows during the summer, particularly before air conditioning became popular. Cities Service installed the unit-ventilating system on the lower part of the building above the fifth floor, and tenants on the upper stories could also install the system in their own office.

== History ==
Henry Latham Doherty became successful by operating numerous companies in the manufactured-gas and electric utility sectors in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He formed the Cities Service Company as a &quot;light, heat, and power&quot; firm in 1910, and Doherty&#x27;s business interests grew extensively in subsequent years. At the time, his main offices were located at 60 Wall Street (built 1905 and demolished 1975), which he had occupied since 1906, and was located just south of the present building site. This structure measured 15 stories high at its front, on Wall Street, and 27 stories high at its rear, on Pine Street.

=== Development ===

==== Planning ====
Doherty, who already owned several Lower Manhattan properties, purchased 60 Wall Street in December 1924 with the aim of expanding the structure. Thomas J. George of Clinton &amp; Russell presented plans in March 1927 for a modern slab-like structure on Wall Street. That October, George modified the plans, which now called for a 60-story structure shaped like a turret. Doherty formed the Pine Street Realty Company in January 1929, having failed to develop &quot;a great business centre&quot; near Battery Park. The firm of Clinton &amp; Russell were retained as architects and proposed two plans for the site: a simple slab rising from the ground and a Gothic Revival design rising 60 floors. The New York City Department of Buildings rejected the proposed structure on Wall Street.The Pine Street Realty Company then started buying land across Pine Street. The site was in the core of the Financial District, near the Third Avenue elevated line, and was surrounded by shorter buildings. The company bought twelve buildings in January 1929, forming a plot with {{convert|17,000|ft2| |abbr=}}. Another five plots were acquired via lease in November 1929, and the Cities Service Company was in negotiations to acquire the Down Town Association building as well. At the time, the company planned to build between 25 and 50 stories. Two more lots were leased in July 1930. In total, the Pine Street Realty Company acquired 23 lots, which all contained low-rise three- to five-story masonry buildings, at a total cost of $2 million, relatively cheap for the time. The economist W. C. Clark investigated the planned Cities Service Building&#x27;s design and, in October 1929, spoke about his findings at the Engineers&#x27; Club. He found that taller buildings on small lots could be profitable, provided that these included double-deck elevators due to the lot&#x27;s small size. As a result, the proposed Cities Service Building was most economically viable as a 63-story building.

Clinton &amp; Russell, under the leadership of Thomas George, designed the new building in the Art Deco style. This contrasted with the firm&#x27;s earlier works, which were largely designed in the classical style; the original partners had died before 70 Pine Street was constructed. Doherty submitted the building&#x27;s architectural plans to the Department of Buildings in May 1930. The structure was slated to have 63 stories, including double-decker elevators due to the lot&#x27;s small size, and it would cost $7 million. It was one of several buildings that Doherty planned to erect in Lower Manhattan, though none of the other projects were realized because of a lack of funding following the Great Depression. After the building plans were submitted, the height was increased to 66 stories, and a spire was added, increasing the total height to {{convert|950|ft||abbr=}} or {{convert|952|ft}}. The Cities Service Building thus beat the {{convert|927|ft||abbr=|adj=on}} 40 Wall Street to become the tallest building in Manhattan south of 34th Street. August H. Fromm oversaw the building&#x27;s planning and construction.

==== Construction ====
Construction started in May 1930 and continued for 24 months. Demolition of existing buildings and site excavation began almost immediately after the building plans were submitted. The western portion of the site was the first to be cleared. Some {{convert|100,000|ST|LT t|abbr=}} of soil were removed from the site, which was excavated to as deep as {{convert|60|ft||abbr=}}. The foundation took 245,000 worker-hours to complete; it is composed of 49 piers, which are arranged in four rows and descend {{convert|24|ft}} to the underlying bedrock. Work was complicated by the presence of a holdout tenant, Nik Coutroulas, a cafeteria operator who held a lease on one of the existing buildings and also operated a Lindy&#x27;s franchise. Doherty&#x27;s company could not reach a lease agreement with Coutroulas prior to the start of work. Coutrolas&#x27;s building was demolished anyway and he sued Doherty for damages, eventually receiving a $5,000 compensation.

Construction was funded using a then-unconventional method of public offering. Henry L. Doherty &amp; Co. sold $15.7 million of interest-free shares, described at the time as &quot;financially unique among large New York office buildings&quot;. The company operated local branch offices in several cities, each of which had to raise a certain amount of money before October 1930. Each office had to meet a different quota: the Spokane, Washington, office had to raise $91,500, while the New York City office was required to raise $3 million. This avoided the need for the building&#x27;s owners to take out a mortgage loan.

The project involved large amounts of materials, including 10 million bricks, {{convert|23.5|e6lb}} of cement, and {{convert|24000|ST|LT t}} of steel. The steel structure was built at an average rate of three floors per week. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in April 1931 that the steel had been erected to the 27th floor. By mid-1931, steel frame construction had reached the 59th floor, while the facade had been built up to the 50th floor. At the time, 70 Pine Street&#x27;s construction employed 600 workers, and the structure had no official name. To date, workers had been on the project for 119,000 hours without any major accidents. The spire was installed in October 1931. The sky bridge between 70 Pine Street and 60 Wall Street was completed in February 1932, at which point the building at 70 Pine Street became known as the 60 Wall Tower.

===Cities Service ownership===
By early 1932, the 60 Wall Tower was completed. The city&#x27;s Department of Buildings gave the building a temporary occupancy certificate in March 1932, followed by a permanent certificate that August. The building was dedicated on May 13, 1932, Doherty&#x27;s 62nd birthday. The event celebrated Doherty&#x27;s reinstatement as executive of Cities Service after he had taken a six-year hiatus from the position due to health problems. It included a luncheon attended by 200 businessmen; the dedication of Doherty&#x27;s bronze bust; the spire&#x27;s floodlighting; and a radio announcement that Doherty made from the spire using then-new &quot;moonbeam&quot; technology. Cities Service also issued a pamphlet to advertise its new building.

Tenants had started moving into 70 Pine Street prior to its official dedication. Upon opening, the second through seventeenth floors were occupied by about 3,000 employees of Cities Service. The remaining floors were leased to a large range of tenants, including manufacturers, lawyers, accountants, and the Western Union Telegraph Company. At the time of the building&#x27;s opening, its tenants included 31 law firms, 21 investment firms, eight insurance companies, and 18 companies in other industries. Most tenants on the upper floors were lawyers, who took advantage of the 29th-floor law library. The second and third floors were also occupied by the Emergency Unemployment Relief Committee. Additionally, more than 200 people worked for the building itself under the supervision of building manager Edgar J. Smith. These included an all-female staff of elevator operators, most of whom were redheads &quot;recruited largely from the ranks of unemployed showgirls&quot;.

The building was reportedly two-thirds rented by 1933, but it did not reach 90 percent occupancy until 1941. Later tenants included the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which took space in 70 Pine Street in 1941. The radio station WGYN also established its studios and transmitter at 70 Pine Street when it was founded in December 1941, and WGYN continued to broadcast from there until May 1950. Cities Service refinanced the building with a $5.3 million, 20-year mortgage loan in March 1950.

One portion of 70 Pine Street was separately owned from the rest of the building and could be physically separated if necessary. This section, covering {{convert|10000|ft2||abbr=}}, was owned by the estate of aviator Cortlandt F. Bishop and leased to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cities Service Company, Sixty Wall Tower Inc. In June 1950, the land under the building was placed for auction by the New York Trust Company on behalf of Bishop&#x27;s estate. After World War II, Cities Service downsized its Manhattan staff and leased out several lower floors. Merrill was one such tenant, leasing ten floors in a 1957 transaction, and ultimately moving 3,400 of its 8,600 employees to 70 Pine Street by 1965. Though Cities Service became known as Citgo in 1965, the building retained the &quot;Cities Service Building&quot; name.

=== AIG ownership ===

Citgo announced in November 1973 that it would move its executive headquarters to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and sell off 70 Pine Street and several other buildings in Manhattan. The move would affect about 250 personnel at 70 Pine Street. Citgo subsequently moved to Tulsa in 1975. The following year, the building was purchased for $15 million by the American International Group (AIG), which wanted to double the amount of space available for its 500 New York City employees. 70 Pine Street was renamed the American International Building, and AIG workers moved into the structure over the next two years. AIG occupied the lowest 26 stories and leased out {{convert|250000|ft2}} to other companies, such as law firms, securities firms, and brokerages.

Under AIG&#x27;s ownership, the lobby was renovated, as was the observation deck, which became a private office. The sky bridge to Wall Street was demolished in 1975 when the previous building at 60 Wall Street was razed. By the 1990s, the building&#x27;s tenants also included the Starr Foundation, which had been established by AIG founder Cornelius Vander Starr and paid no rent for its offices. AIG bought the nearby 175 Water Street in 1995 but kept its headquarters at 70 Pine Street. AIG refurbished the building&#x27;s elevators in the late 1990s. Restoration architect HLW International used blueprints from Otis, the original elevators&#x27; manufacturer, to redesign the single-deck elevator cabs in the style of the original double-deck cabs.

70 Pine Street continued as AIG&#x27;s world headquarters until the financial crisis of 2007–08, when the company went bankrupt and received a bailout from the U.S. government. To repay the federal government, AIG decided to sell its buildings and other assets in March 2009. AIG announced in June 2009 that it had reached an agreement to sell the building and to relocate. The building was acquired by developer Youngwoo &amp; Associates and the Kumho Investment Bank, which spent a combined $150 million on 70 Pine Street and 72 Wall Street. This amounted to {{convert|100|$/ft2}}, about 80 percent less than what AIG could have received for the building before the 2000s financial crisis, according to &quot;Crain&#x27;s New York Business&quot;.

===Residential and hotel conversion===
Youngwoo initially planned to renovate 70 Pine Street&#x27;s upper stories into condominiums, which would be sold for {{convert|2000|$/ft2}}. The lower floors were to be rented to office tenants for {{convert|33|to|35|$/ft2}}, a 25 to 30 percent decline from asking rates before the late-2000s recession. Because of an oversupply of office space in Lower Manhattan, few companies were willing to lease the {{convert|500000|ft2}} of vacant office space at 70 Pine Street. Furthermore, a decline in demand for luxury condominiums in Manhattan, spurred by the late-2000s recession, prompted Youngwoo to cancel its condo-conversion plan. Kumho Investment Bank then hired Sciame Development to take over the project in 2011. That June, Kumho agreed to sell the building to MetroLoft Management. This prompted Sciame to sue Kumho for breach of contract.

MetroLoft finalized its acquisition in January 2012, with plans to turn 70 Pine Street into an apartment building or a combined hotel/apartment complex with about 1,000 total units. MetroLoft sold 70 Pine Street to Rose Associates later that year. Rose and DTH Capital transformed 70 Pine Street into a mixed-use building featuring luxury rental apartments and a variety of retail and restaurants starting in 2015. Leasing of the residential units started in December 2015. The renovation was completed the next year, with leasing beginning in February 2016. DTH and Rose obtained $375 million in financing from a syndicate led by Brookfield Properties in May 2017. This was replaced in 2019 with a $386 million mortgage loan from Goldman Sachs.

Unlike the top floors of other converted residential buildings, which were generally turned into penthouse apartments, Rose decided to add amenities to the top floors of 70 Pine Street. Space in 70 Pine Street&#x27;s lobby and upper floors was originally set to contain restaurants by April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman, who withdrew from the project in July 2016. Ultimately, the upper-floor restaurant spaces hosted James Kent and Jeff Katz&#x27;s restaurant Crown Shy, which opened in 2019. Mint House opened a 132-unit hotel for business travelers inside the building in November 2020. The Overstory bar opened on the 64th floor in August 2021, and the Saga restaurant opened atop the building later that year. In February 2024, DTH and Rose refinanced the building with $395 million from Goldman Sachs.

== Critical reception and landmark designations ==
The completed building attracted attention from figures such as the photographer Weegee, who in 1946 took many photographs of the building&#x27;s tenants and services. According to author Daniel Abramson, Weegee &quot;was fascinated by this city within a city, its swift transportation, its towering height and subterranean depth, its busy thousands of tenants and visitors, and the unobtrusive, night-and-day efficiency of its service staff&quot;. The skyscraper was featured in pictures of Lower Manhattan, such as &quot;A New York Canyon&quot;, a 1932 image by W. K. Oltar-Jevsky. Other photographs, depicting seaplanes and blimps flying over 70 Pine Street, reinforced the building&#x27;s association with the Jazz Age.

In 1981, architectural critic Paul Goldberger described 70 Pine Street, 1 Wall Street, and several buildings on nearby John Street as &quot;an echo of the jazz age life&quot;. Goldberger wrote of the building&#x27;s spire in 1983: &quot;The lighting is simple and elegant. A lovely translucent glass crown forms the top of the Art Deco setback spire, and at night it glows softly in the midst of the somber financial district.&quot; Another &quot;Times&quot; critic wrote in 2005 that the lobby was &quot;a paradigm of Art Deco style: sunburst ceilings, filigreed radiator grilles, marble floors in black and earth tones, and elevator doors emblazoned with zigzags and Aztec-like figures.&quot; The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) considered designating 70 Pine Street&#x27;s exterior and its first-floor interior as city landmarks in March 2011, and the building was designated as such on June 21, 2011. When 70 Pine Street became a New York City landmark, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;With its tiered glass lantern and stainless steel spire, it is an icon of the Lower Manhattan skyline.&quot;

==Incidents==
In 1976, two thousand tenants were evacuated after a fire broke out on the eighth floor, causing several minor injuries. In November 2016, Justin Casquejo, a thrill-seeking teenage free solo climber and stunt performer, hung from 70 Pine Street. He was charged with misdemeanor base jumping and trespassing for climbing on the tower.

<doc id="485573" wikidata="Q5153150" url="?curid=485573" title="Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000">
<text>The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA) is a United States federal law that ensures that over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives remained unregulated.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had desired to have &quot;functional regulation&quot; of the market, but the CFMA rejected this approach. Instead, the CFTC continued to do &quot;entity-based supervision of OTC derivatives dealers&quot;. The CFMA&#x27;s handling of OTC derivatives, such as credit default swaps, has become controversial, as these derivatives played a major role in the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent 2008–2012 global recession. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) of 2000 is a landmark piece of legislation in the United States that significantly altered the regulation of financial markets. Signed into law on December 21, 2000, the CFMA had several major impacts on the trading of derivatives, futures, and other financial instruments. Key Provisions:Deregulation of Over-the-Counter (OTC) Derivatives: One of the most significant features of the CFMA was that it removed the regulatory oversight of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, such as credit default swaps (CDS). Prior to this, derivatives had been subject to varying degrees of regulation. The CFMA clarified that these contracts were exempt from oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

== Introduction ==
Before and after the CFMA, federal banking regulators imposed capital and other requirements on banks that entered into OTC derivatives. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and CFTC had limited &quot;risk assessment&quot; authority over OTC derivatives dealers affiliated with securities or commodities brokers and also jointly administered a voluntary program under which the largest securities and commodities firms reported additional information about derivative activities, management controls, risk and capital management, and counterparty exposure policies that were similar to, but more limited than, the requirements for banks. Banks and securities firms were the dominant dealers in the market, with commercial bank dealers holding by far the largest share. To the extent insurance company affiliates acted as dealers of OTC derivatives rather than as counterparties to transactions with banks or security firm affiliates, they had no such federal &quot;safety and soundness&quot; regulation of those activities and typically conducted the activities through London-based affiliates.

The CFMA continued an existing 1992 preemption of state laws enacted in the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992 which prevented the law from treating eligible OTC derivatives transactions as gambling or otherwise illegal. It also extended that preemption to security-based derivatives that had previously been excluded from the CEA and its preemption of state law. The CFMA, as enacted by President Clinton, went beyond the recommendations of a Presidential Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) report titled &quot;Over-the Counter Derivatives and the Commodity Exchange Act&quot; (the &quot;PWG Report&quot;). President&#x27;s Working Group on Financial Markets, November 1999:
*Lawrence Summers, Treasury Department
*Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve
*Arthur Levitt, SEC
*William J Rainer, CFTC

Although hailed by the PWG on the day of congressional passage as &quot;important legislation&quot; to allow &quot;the United States to maintain its competitive position in the over-the-counter derivative markets&quot;, by 2001 the collapse of Enron brought public attention to the CFMA&#x27;s treatment of energy derivatives in the &quot;Enron Loophole&quot;. Following the Federal Reserve&#x27;s emergency loans to &quot;rescue&quot; American International Group (AIG) in September 2008, the CFMA has received even more widespread criticism for its treatment of credit default swaps and other OTC derivatives.

In 2008 the &quot;Close the Enron Loophole Act&quot; was enacted into law to regulate more extensively &quot;energy trading facilities.&quot; On August 11, 2009, the Treasury Department sent Congress draft legislation to implement its proposal to amend the CFMA and other laws to provide &quot;comprehensive regulation of all over-the counter derivatives.&quot; This proposal was revised in the House and, in that revised form, passed by the House on December 11, 2009, as part of H.R. 4173 (Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act). Separate, but similar, proposed legislation was introduced in the Senate and is still awaiting Senate action at the time of the House action.

==Background==

===OTC derivatives regulation before the CFMA===

====Exchange trading requirement====

The PWG Report was directed at ending controversy over how swaps and other OTC derivatives related to the CEA. A derivative is a financial contract or instrument that &quot;derives&quot; its value from the price or other characteristic of an underlying &quot;thing&quot; (or &quot;commodity&quot;). A farmer might enter into a &quot;derivative contract&quot; under which the farmer would sell from next summer&#x27;s harvest a specified number of bushels of wheat at a specified price per bushel. If this contract were executed on a commodity exchange, it would be a &quot;futures contract&quot;. Before 1974, the CEA only applied to agricultural commodities. &quot;Future delivery&quot; contracts in agricultural commodities listed in the CEA were required to be traded on regulated exchanges such as the Chicago Board of Trade.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974 created the CFTC as the new regulator of commodity exchanges. It also expanded the scope of the CEA to cover the previously listed agricultural products and &quot;all other goods and articles, except onions, and all services, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.&quot; Existing non-exchange traded financial &quot;commodity&quot; derivatives markets (mostly &quot;interbank&quot; markets) in foreign currencies, government securities, and other specified instruments were excluded from the CEA through the &quot;Treasury Amendment&quot;, to the extent transactions in such markets remained off a &quot;board of trade.&quot; The expanded CEA, however, did not generally exclude financial derivatives.

After the 1974 law change, the CEA continued to require that all &quot;future delivery&quot; contracts in commodities covered by the law be executed on a regulated exchange. This meant any &quot;future delivery&quot; contract entered into by parties off a regulated exchange would be illegal and unenforceable. The term &quot;future delivery&quot; was not defined in the CEA. Its meaning evolved through CFTC actions and court rulings.

Not all derivative contracts are &quot;future delivery&quot; contracts. The CEA always excluded &quot;forward delivery&quot; contracts under which, for example, a farmer might set today the price at which the farmer would deliver to a grain elevator or other buyer a certain number of bushels of wheat to be harvested next summer. By the early 1980s a market in interest rate and currency &quot;swaps&quot; had emerged in which banks and their customers would typically agree to exchange interest or currency amounts based on one party paying a fixed interest rate amount (or an amount in a specified currency) and the other paying a floating interest rate amount (or an amount in a different currency). These transactions were similar to &quot;forward delivery&quot; contracts under which &quot;commercial users&quot; of a commodity contracted for future deliveries of that commodity at an agreed upon price.

Based on the similarities between swaps and &quot;forward delivery&quot; contracts, the swap market grew rapidly in the United States during the 1980s. Nevertheless, as a 2006 Congressional Research Service report explained in describing the status of OTC derivatives in the 1980s: &quot;if a court had ruled that a swap was in fact an illegal, off-exchange futures contract, trillions of dollars in outstanding swaps could have been invalidated. This might have caused chaos in financial markets, as swaps users would suddenly be exposed to the risks they had used derivatives to avoid.&quot;

====&quot;Legal certainty&quot; through regulatory exemptions====

To eliminate this risk, the CFTC and the Congress acted to give &quot;legal certainty&quot; to swaps and, more generally, to the OTC derivatives market activities of &quot;sophisticated parties.&quot;

First, the CFTC issued &quot;policy statements&quot; and &quot;statutory interpretations&quot; that swaps, &quot;hybrid instruments&quot; (i.e., securities or deposits with a derivative component), and certain &quot;forward transactions&quot; were not covered by the CEA. The CFTC issued the forward transactions &quot;statutory interpretation&quot; in response to a court ruling that a &quot;Brent&quot; (i.e., North Sea) oil &quot;forward delivery&quot; contract was, in fact, a &quot;future delivery&quot; contract, which could cause it to be illegal and unenforceable under the CEA. This, along with a court ruling in the United Kingdom that swaps entered into by a local UK government unit were illegal, elevated concerns with &quot;legal certainty.&quot;

Second, in response to this concern about &quot;legal certainty&quot;, Congress (through the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992 (FTPA)) gave the CFTC authority to exempt transactions from the exchange trading requirement and other provisions of the CEA. The CFTC used that authority (as Congress contemplated or &quot;instructed&quot;) to exempt the same three categories of transactions for which it had previously issued policy statements or statutory interpretations. The FTPA also provided that such CFTC exemptions preempted any state law that would otherwise make such transactions illegal as gambling or otherwise. To preserve the 1982 Shad-Johnson Accord, which prohibited futures on &quot;non-exempt securities&quot;, the FTPA prohibited the CFTC from granting an exemption from that prohibition. This would later lead to concerns about the &quot;legal certainty&quot; of swaps and other OTC derivatives related to &quot;securities.&quot;

Similar to the existing statutory exclusion for &quot;forward delivery&quot; contracts, the 1989 &quot;policy statement&quot; on swaps had required that swaps covered by the &quot;policy statement&quot; be privately negotiated transactions between sophisticated parties covering (or &quot;hedging&quot;) risks arising from their business (including investment and financing) activities. The new &quot;swaps exemption&quot; dropped the &quot;hedging&quot; requirement. It continued to require the swap be entered into by &quot;sophisticated parties&quot; (i.e., &quot;eligible swap participants&quot;) in private transactions.

Although OTC derivatives were subject to criticism in the 1990s and bills were introduced in Congress to regulate aspects of the market, the 1993 exemptions remained in place. Bank regulators issued guidelines and requirements for bank OTC derivatives activities that responded to many of the concerns raised by Congress, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and others. Securities firms agreed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and CFTC to establish a Derivatives Policy Group through which six large securities firms conducting the great majority of securities firm OTC derivatives activities reported to the CFTC and SEC about their activities and adopted voluntary principles similar to those applicable to banks. Insurance companies, which represented a much smaller part of the market, remained outside any federal oversight of their OTC derivatives activities.

===CFTC/SEC dispute===

====Dispute====

In 1997 and 1998 a conflict developed between the CFTC and the SEC over an SEC proposal to ease its broker-dealer regulations for securities firm affiliates that engaged in OTC derivatives activities. The SEC proposed relaxed net capital and other rules (known as &quot;Broker-Dealer Lite&quot;) for OTC derivatives dealers. The CFTC objected that some activities that would be authorized by this proposal were not permitted under the CEA. The CFTC also issued a &quot;concept release&quot; requesting comments on whether the OTC derivatives market was properly regulated under the existing CEA exemptions and on whether market developments required regulatory changes.

The CFTC&#x27;s actions were widely viewed as a response to the SEC&#x27;s Broker-Dealer Lite proposal and, at least by Professor John C. Coffee, as perhaps an attempt to force the SEC to withdraw the proposal. The CFTC expressed dismay over the Broker-Dealer Lite proposal and the manner in which it was issued, but also noted it was 18 months into a &quot;comprehensive regulatory reform effort.&quot; The same day the CFTC issued its &quot;concept release&quot; Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Federal Reserve Board Chair Alan Greenspan, and SEC Chair Arthur Levitt (who, along with CFTC Chair Brooksley Born, were the members of the PWG) issued a letter asking Congress to prevent the CFTC from changing its existing treatment of OTC derivatives. They argued that, by calling into question whether swaps and other OTC derivatives were &quot;futures&quot;, the CFTC was calling into question the legality of security related OTC derivatives for which the CFTC could not grant exemptions (as described in Section 1.1.2 above) and, more broadly, undermining an &quot;implicit agreement&quot; not to raise the question of the CEA&#x27;s coverage of swaps and other established OTC derivatives.

In the ensuing Congressional hearings, the three members of the PWG dissenting from the CFTC&#x27;s &quot;unilateral&quot; actions argued the CFTC was not the proper body, and the CEA was not the proper statute, to regulate OTC derivatives activities. Banks and securities firms dominated the OTC derivatives market. Their regulators needed to be involved in any regulation of the market. Bank regulators and the SEC already monitored and regulated bank and broker-dealer OTC Derivatives activities. The dissenting PWG members explained that any effort to regulate those activities through the CEA would only lead to the activities moving outside the United States. In the 1980s banks had used offshore branches to book transactions potentially covered by the CEA. Securities firms were still using London and other foreign offices to book at least securities related derivatives transactions. Any change in regulation of OTC derivatives should only occur after a full study of the issue by the entire PWG.

CFTC Chair Mrs.Brooksley Born replied that the CFTC had exclusive authority over &quot;futures&quot; under the CEA and could not allow the other PWG members to dictate the CFTC&#x27;s authority under that statute. She pointed out the &quot;concept release&quot; did not propose, nor presuppose the need for, any change in the regulatory treatment of OTC derivatives. She noted, however, that changes in the OTC derivatives market had made that market more similar to futures markets.

Congress passed a law preventing the CFTC from changing its treatment of OTC derivatives through March 1999. CFTC Chair Born lost control of the issue at the CFTC when three of her four fellow Commissioners announced they supported the legislation and would temporarily not vote to take any action concerning OTC derivatives. CFTC Chair Born resigned effective June 1999. Her successor, William Rainer, was CFTC Chair when the PWG Report was issued in November 1999.

====Other background events====

While the dispute between the SEC and CFTC over OTC derivatives jurisdiction was at the core of pre-2008 narrations of the events leading to the CFMA, two other noteworthy background events occurred. First, in early 1997 CFTC Chairperson Born testified forcefully to Congress against a Senate bill that would have authorized futures exchanges to establish &quot;professional markets&quot; exempt from many regulatory requirements in a manner similar to the &quot;regulatory relief&quot; ultimately provided for an &quot;exempt board of trade&quot; under the CFMA. In her testimony to the Senate Agriculture Committee and in several subsequent speeches during the first half of 1997, Chairperson Born argued OTC derivatives did not create the same &quot;concentration of financial risk&quot; as exchange-traded futures and did not perform the &quot;unique price discovery&quot; function of exchange traded contracts. She argued these differences justified different regulatory treatment.

Chairperson Born&#x27;s 1997 testimony on the difference between exchange and OTC markets was consistent with her first speech as CFTC Chair on October 24, 1996, in which she stated her belief that regulation of the OTC derivatives market should be limited to fraud and manipulation. While her 1997 testimony opposed the Senate bill&#x27;s provision to codify in law the existing CFTC regulatory exemptions for OTC derivatives, she also stated the CFTC was &quot;watching&quot; the OTC derivatives market with the PWG and had no plans to modify the existing CFTC exemptions for that market.

The futures exchanges argued they needed permission to operate &quot;professional markets&quot; free of &quot;regulatory burdens&quot; in order to compete with foreign exchanges and the OTC derivatives market that catered to the same professionals. 1997 news reports attributed the failure of the &quot;professional markets&quot; legislation to disagreements concerning equity derivatives between the Chicago Board of Trade and the OTC derivatives dealers, on the one side, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other futures exchanges, on the other.

Second, after the 1998 CFTC &quot;concept release&quot; controversy arose, Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) became headline news with the near collapse of a hedge fund it managed. The near collapse was widely attributed to OTC derivatives transactions. At an October 1, 1998, hearing before the House Banking Committee, Chairperson Born received compliments from some members of the Committee for having raised important issues in the May &quot;concept release.&quot; The hearing, however, focused on issues with regulatory oversight of the banks and security firms that had given the LTCM fund high leverage through both loans and OTC derivative transactions.

The 1999 GAO Report that analyzed the LTCM experience criticized federal regulators for not coordinating their oversight of LTCM&#x27;s activities with banks and securities firms. The Report also recommended &quot;consideration of&quot; legislation to grant the SEC and CFTC consolidated supervision authority for securities and commodities firms in order to supervise the OTC derivatives activities of those consolidated entities in a manner similar to the Federal Reserve&#x27;s authority over bank holding companies. The GAO Report did not consider, and did not recommend, CFTC regulation of OTC derivatives.

An effect of the LTCM experience was that the conference committee report adopting the six-month moratorium on CFTC action affecting OTC derivative regulation included a statement that &quot;the conferees strongly urge&quot; the PWG to study OTC derivatives transactions of hedge funds and others. Although Chairperson Born had explained at the October 1, 1998, House Banking Committee hearing that the CFTC&#x27;s supervisory authority over the LTCM fund as a &quot;commodity pool operator&quot; was limited to monitoring its exchange trading activities, the CFTC&#x27;s possession of financial statements for the fund received negative news coverage in November 1998 based on the fact the CFTC was the only federal regulator to receive such reports directly from LTCM and had not shared the information with other members of the PWG. When the LTCM matter was investigated at a December 16, 1998, Senate Agriculture Committee hearing, the three CFTC Commissioners that had supported the Congressional moratorium, as described in Section 1.2.1 above, reiterated their support and their position that the entire PWG should study the OTC derivatives market and the issues raised in the CFTC&#x27;s &quot;concept release.&quot;

The PWG Report recommended: (1) the codification into the CEA, as an &quot;exclusion&quot;, of existing regulatory exemptions for OTC financial derivatives, revised to permit electronic trading between &quot;eligible swaps participants&quot; (acting as &quot;principals&quot;) and to even allow standardized (i.e. &quot;fungible&quot;) contracts subject to &quot;regulated&quot; clearing; (2) continuation of the existing CFTC authority to exempt other non-agricultural commodities (such as energy products) from provisions of the CEA; (3) continuation of existing exemptions for &quot;hybrid instruments&quot; expanded to cover the Shad-Johnson Accord (thereby exempting from the CEA any hybrid that could be viewed as a future on a &quot;non-exempt security&quot;), and a prohibition on the CFTC changing the exemption without the agreement of the other members of the PWG; (4) continuation of the preemption of state laws that might otherwise make any &quot;excluded&quot; or &quot;exempted&quot; transactions illegal as gambling or otherwise; (5) as previously recommended by the PWG in its report on hedge funds, the expansion of SEC and CFTC &quot;risk assessment&quot; oversight of affiliates of securities firms and commodity firms engaged in OTC derivatives activities to ensure they did not endanger affiliated broker-dealers or futures commission merchants; (6) encouraging the CFTC to grant broad &quot;deregulation&quot; of existing exchange trading to reflect differences in (A) the susceptibility of commodities to price manipulation and (B) the &quot;sophistication&quot; and financial strength of the parties permitted to trade on the exchange; and (7) permission for single stock and narrow index stock futures on terms to be agreed between the CFTC and SEC.

In 1998 the CFTC had disagreed with the other members of the PWG about the scope and purposes of the CEA. Whereas the CFTC saw broad purposes in protecting &quot;fair access&quot; to markets, &quot;financial integrity&quot;, &quot;price discovery and transparency&quot;, &quot;fitness standards,&quot; and protection of &quot;market participants from fraud and other abuses,&quot; other members of the PWG (particularly the Federal Reserve through Alan Greenspan) found the more limited purposes of (1) preventing price manipulation and (2) protecting retail investors.

The PWG Report ended that disagreement by analyzing only four issues in deciding not to apply the CEA to OTC derivatives. By finding (1) the sophisticated parties participating in the OTC derivatives markets did not require CEA protections, (2) the activities of most OTC derivatives dealers were already subject to direct or indirect federal oversight, (3) manipulation of financial markets through financial OTC derivatives had not occurred and was highly unlikely, and (4) the OTC derivatives market performed no significant &quot;price discovery&quot; function, the PWG concluded &quot;there is no compelling evidence of problems involving bilateral swap agreements that would warrant regulation under the CEA.&quot; By essentially adopting the views of the other members of the PWG concerning the scope and application of the CEA, the CFTC permitted a &quot;remarkable&quot; agreement &quot;on a redrawing of the regulatory lines.&quot;

The PWG Report encouraged the growth in similarities between the OTC derivatives market and the regulated exchange-traded futures market. Price information could be broadly disseminated through &quot;electronic trading facilities.&quot; The PWG Report also emphasized the desire to &quot;maintain U.S. leadership in these rapidly developing markets&quot; by discouraging the movement of such transactions &quot;offshore&quot;. In the 1998 Congressional hearings concerning the CFTC &quot;concept release&quot; Representative James A. Leach (R-IA) had tied the controversy to &quot;systemic risk&quot; by arguing the movement of transactions to jurisdictions outside the United States would replace U.S. regulation with laxer foreign supervision. It can be argued that the PWG Report recommendations and the CFMA as enacted did not change the &quot;regulation&quot; of OTC derivatives because there was no existing regulation under the CEA or securities laws. The change to the CEA, however, would be the elimination of existing criteria for distinguishing OTC derivatives from &quot;futures&quot;.

=== CFMA implementation ===
Title I of the CFMA adopted recommendations of the PWG Report by broadly excluding from the CEA transactions in financial derivatives (i.e. &quot;excluded commodities&quot;) between &quot;eligible contract participants.&quot; The definition of &quot;eligible contract participant&quot; covered the same types of &quot;sophisticated&quot; parties as the existing &quot;swaps exemption&quot; in its definition of &quot;eligible swap participants&quot;, but was broader, particularly by adding permission for individuals with assets of $5 million rather than $10 million, if the transaction related to managing asset or liability &quot;risk&quot;. The PWG had recommended &quot;considering&quot; an increase in this threshold to $25 million, not a reduction for actual hedging.

Such &quot;eligible contract participants&quot; could enter into transactions on or off &quot;electronic trading facilities&quot; without being subject to any of the regulatory oversight applicable to futures. The only exception was that the transactions would be subject to the rules for the new &quot;Derivative Clearing Organizations&quot; authorized by the CFMA, if the transaction used such a clearing facility. The CFMA did not require that standardized transaction use a clearing facility. It only authorized their existence, subject to regulatory oversight. The PWG Report had recommended permitting &quot;standardized&quot; contracts, so long as they were subject to regulated clearing. Title I&#x27;s extended most of the same exclusions to non-financial commodities that were not agricultural. These &quot;exempt commodities&quot; were, in practice, mostly energy and metal commodities. As discussed in Section 4, these transactions were subject to the &quot;anti-fraud&quot; and &quot;anti-manipulation&quot; provisions of the CEA in some, but not all, circumstances. The PWG Report had recommended that exemptions for such transactions remain in the control of the CFTC, although it had recommended the continuation of those regulatory exemptions.

Title I also resolved the issue of &quot;hybrid instruments&quot; by defining when such an instrument would be considered a &quot;security&quot; subject to security laws and excluded from the CEA even though it had a &quot;commodity component&quot;. Equivalent treatment of bank products was provided in Title IV. Title I retained the CEA&#x27;s existing preemption of state gambling and other laws that could render a CFTC exempted transaction illegal. It made that preemption applicable to all exempted or excluded transactions. Title I also created a new system under which three different types of exchanges could be established based on the types of commodities and participants on such exchanges.

Title II of the CFMA repealed the 1982 Shad-Johnson Accord that had prohibited single stock and narrow stock index futures and replaced that with a joint CFTC and SEC regulated &quot;security futures&quot; system.

Title III established a framework for SEC regulation of &quot;security-based swaps&quot;. The PWG Report had not addressed this issue.

Title IV established a framework for CFTC regulation of &quot;bank products&quot;. This included coverage of deposit based &quot;hybrid instruments&quot;, but went further. The PWG Report had not dealt with these issues beyond how Title IV overlapped with Title I.

The CFMA did not provide the CFTC or SEC the broader &quot;risk assessment&quot; authority over affiliates of futures commission merchants or broker-dealers that the PWG Report had recommended.

==Legislative history==

===H.R. 4541 and S. 2697===

H.R. 4541 was introduced in the House of Representatives on May 25, 2000, as the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000. Three separate House Committees held hearings on the bill. Each Committee reported out a different amended version of H.R. 4541 by September 6, 2000.

Another Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 was introduced in the Senate on June 8, 2000, as S. 2697. A joint hearing of the Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees was held to consider that bill. The Senate Agriculture Committee reported out an amended version of S. 2697 on August 25, 2000.

During the House and Senate committee hearings on these bills, Committee Chairs and Ranking Members described a tight legislative schedule for the bills because of the election year&#x27;s short Congressional schedule. Sponsors had delayed introduction of the bills as they vainly awaited agreement between the CFTC and SEC on how to regulate the single stock futures contemplated by the PWG Report. That issue dominated the hearings.

On September 14, 2000, the SEC and CFTC announced they had agreed on a joint regulation approach for &quot;security futures.&quot; Senior Treasury Department officials hailed the &quot;historic agreement&quot; as eliminating &quot;the major obstacles to forming a consensus bill.&quot; At the same time, Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX), the Chair of the Senate Banking Committee, was quoted as insisting that any bill brought to the Senate Floor would need to be expanded to include prohibitions on SEC regulation of the swaps market.

Democratic members of Congress later described a period in late September through early October during which they were excluded from negotiations over reconciling the three committee versions of H.R. 4541, followed by involvement in reaching an acceptable compromise that left some Republicans unhappy with the final version of the bill and some Democrats upset over the &quot;process&quot;, particularly the involvement of Sen. Gramm and House Republican leadership in the negotiations. Despite indications no agreement would be reached, on October 19, 2000, the White House announced its &quot;strong support&quot; for the version of H.R. 4541 scheduled to reach the House Floor that day. The House approved H.R. 4541 in a 377–4 vote.

As so passed by the House, H.R. 4541 contained, in Title I, the language concerning OTC derivatives that became the source for Title I of the CFMA and, in Title II, the language regulating &quot;security futures&quot; that became the source for Title II of the CFMA. Titles III and IV would be added when the CFMA was enacted into law two months later.

===From H.R. 4541 to the CFMA===
After the House passed H.R. 4541, press reports indicated Sen. Gramm was blocking Senate action based on his continued insistence that the bill be expanded to prevent the SEC from regulating swaps, and the desire to broaden the protections against CFTC regulation for &quot;bank products&quot;. Nevertheless, with Congress adjourned for the 2000 elections, but scheduled to return for a &quot;lame duck&quot; session, Treasury Secretary Summers &quot;urged&quot; Congress to move forward with legislation on OTC derivatives based on the &quot;extraordinary bipartisan consensus this year on these very complex issues.&quot;.

When Congress returned into session for two days in mid-November, the sponsor of H.R. 4541, Representative Thomas Ewing (R-IL), described Senator Gramm as the &quot;one man&quot; blocking Senate passage of H.R. 4541. Senator Richard G. Lugar (R-IN), the sponsor of S. 2697, was reported to be considering forcing H.R. 4541 to the Senate Floor against Senator Gramm&#x27;s objections.

After Congress returned into session on December 4, 2000, there were reports Senator Gramm and the Treasury Department were exchanging proposed language to deal with the issues raised by Sen. Gramm, followed by a report those negotiations had reached an impasse. On December 14, however, the Treasury Department announced agreement had been reached the night before and urged Congress to enact into law the agreed upon language.

The &quot;compromise language&quot; was introduced in the House on December 14, 2000, as H.R. 5660. The same language was introduced in the Senate on December 15, 2000 as S. 3283. The Senate and House conference that was called to reconcile differences in H.R. 4577 appropriations adopted the &quot;compromise language&quot; by incorporating H.R. 5660 (the &quot;CFMA&quot;) into H.R. 4577, which was titled &quot;Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 2001&quot;. The House passed the Conference Report and, therefore, H.R. 4577 in a vote of 292–60. Over &quot;objection&quot; by Senators James Inhofe (R-OK) and Paul Wellstone (D-MN), the Senate passed the Conference Report, and therefore H.R. 4577, by &quot;unanimous consent&quot;. The Chairs and Ranking members of each of the five Congressional Committees that considered H.R. 4541 or S. 2697 supported, or entered into the Congressional Record statements in support of, the CFMA. The PWG issued letters expressing the unanimous support of each of its four members for the CFMA. H.R. 4577, including H.R. 5660, was signed into law, as CFMA, on December 21, 2000.

==Controversies==
=== Credit default swaps ===
With the 2008 emergence of widespread concerns about credit default swaps, the CFMA&#x27;s treatment of those instruments has become controversial. Title I of the CFMA broadly excludes from the CEA financial derivatives, including specifically any index or measure tied to a &quot;credit risk or measure&quot;. In 2000, Title I&#x27;s exclusion of financial derivatives from the CEA was not controversial in Congress. Instead, it was widely hailed for bringing &quot;legal certainty&quot; to this &quot;important market&quot; permitting &quot;the United States to retain its leadership in the financial markets&quot;, as recommended by the PWG Report.

====Insurance law issue====
The CFMA&#x27;s treatment of credit default swaps has received the most attention for two issues. First, former New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo has argued credit default swaps should have been regulated as insurance and that the CFMA removed a valuable legal tool by preempting state &quot;bucket shop&quot; and gaming laws that could have been used to attack credit default swaps as illegal. In 1992, the FTPA had preempted those state laws for financial derivatives covered by the CFTC&#x27;s &quot;swaps exemption.&quot; As described in Section 1.1.2 above, however, a &quot;gap&quot; in the CFTC&#x27;s powers prohibited it from exempting futures on &quot;non-exempt securities&quot;. This &quot;loophole&quot; (which was intended to preserve the Shad-Johnson Accord&#x27;s prohibition on single stock futures) meant that, before the CFMA, the CEA&#x27;s preemption of state gaming and &quot;bucket shop&quot; laws would not have protected a credit default swap on a &quot;non-exempt security&quot; (i.e. an equity security or a &quot;non-exempt&quot; debt obligation that qualified as a &quot;security&quot;). As before 1992, the application of such state laws to a credit default swap (or any other swap) would depend upon a court finding the swap was a gambling, &quot;bucket shop&quot;, or otherwise illegal transaction. As described in Section 1.2.1 above, legal uncertainty for security-based swaps was an important issue in the events that led to the PWG Report. The PWG Report recommended eliminating that uncertainty by excluding credit default swaps and all security-based swaps from the CEA and by adding to the &quot;hybrid instrument&quot; exemption an exclusion from the Shad-Johnson Accord.

Former Superintendent Dinallo has written that the CFMA was enacted in part to avoid having OTC derivatives transactions move offshore. He has not, however, addressed whether that could have been avoided if the CFMA had not been enacted. AIG (the insurance company addressed by Mr. Dinallo&#x27;s commentary) located its controversial derivatives dealer (AIG Financial Products) in London and conducted its &quot;regulatory CDS&quot; transactions through a French bank (Banque AIG) because of the bank regulatory capital provision that banks (not AAA rated parties) received a reduced credit risk &quot;weighting&quot; for their obligations, including CDS, owed to other banks. General Re, the other insurance company with a very active derivatives dealer affiliate, similarly established that dealer in London.

====Securities law issue====
Second, Title II of the CFMA treated credit default swaps tied to &quot;securities&quot; as &quot;security-related swaps&quot; for which the SEC was granted limited authority to enforce &quot;insider trading&quot;, fraud, and anti-manipulation provisions of the securities laws. Before the CFMA, it was generally agreed most swaps were not securities, but the SEC had always maintained that swaps tied to securities were securities, particularly when such swaps could reproduce the attributes of owning the underlying security. In granting the SEC authority over &quot;security-related swaps&quot;, the CFMA specifically prohibited applying any &quot;prophylactic&quot; anti-fraud or anti-manipulation measures. The SEC has complained this has prevented it from collecting information, and requiring disclosures, regarding credit default positions of investors. The SEC has argued this handicaps its ability to monitor possible manipulations of security markets through credit default swaps.

====Centralized clearing====
The SEC, the PWG, and others have also expressed concern about the &quot;systemic risk&quot; created by a lack of centralized clearing of credit default swaps. Although (as noted in Section 2 above) the CFMA created the possibility of centralized clearing by removing the pre-CFMA requirements that OTC derivatives not be subject to centralized clearing, the CFMA did not require such clearing, even for &quot;standardized&quot; transactions.

===&quot;Enron Loophole&quot;===
====Section 2(h) &quot;loophole&quot;====
The first provision of the CFMA to receive widespread popular attention was the &quot;Enron Loophole&quot;. In most accounts, this &quot;loophole&quot; was the CEA&#x27;s new section 2(h). Section 2(h) created two exemptions from the CEA for &quot;exempt commodities&quot; such as oil and other &quot;energy&quot; products.

First, any transaction in exempt commodities not executed on a &quot;trading facility&quot; between &quot;eligible contract participants&quot; (acting as principals) was exempted from most CEA provisions (other than fraud and anti-manipulation provisions). This exemption in Section 2(h)(1) of the CEA covered the &quot;bilateral swaps market&quot; for exempt &quot;trading facilities.&quot;

Second, any transaction in exempt commodities executed on an &quot;electronic trading facility&quot; between &quot;eligible commercial entities&quot; (acting as principals) was also exempted from most CEA provisions (other than those dealing with fraud and manipulation). The &quot;trading facility&quot;, however, was required to file with the CFTC certain information and certifications and to provide trading and other information to the CFTC upon any &quot;special call.&quot; This exemption in Section 2(h)(2) of the CEA covered the &quot;commercial entities&quot; for exempt &quot;electronic trading facilities.&quot;

While the language of Section 2(h) was in H.R. 4541 as passed by the House, the portion of Section 2(h) dealing with the exempt commercial market had been deleted from S. 2697 when the Senate Agriculture Committee reported out an amended version of that bill. H.R. 4541 served as the basis for Titles I and II of the CFMA. The Senate Agriculture Committee&#x27;s removal of the Section 2(h) language from S. 2697, however, served as the basis for later Senate concern over the origins of Section 2(h).

In 2008 Congress enacted into law over President Bush&#x27;s veto an Omnibus Farm Bill that contained the &quot;Close the Enron Loophole Act.&quot; This added to CEA Section 2(h)(2) a new definition of &quot;electronic trading facility&quot; and imposed on such facilities requirements applicable to fully regulated exchanges (i.e. &quot;designated contract markets&quot;) such as the NYMEX. The legislation did not change Section 2(h)(1) exemption for the &quot;bilateral swaps market&quot; in exempt commodities.

====Section 2(g) &quot;loophole&quot;====

Section 2(g) of the CEA is also sometimes called the &quot;Enron Loophole&quot;. It is a broader exclusion from the CEA than the Section 2(h)(1) exemption for the &quot;bilateral swaps market&quot; in exempt commodities. It excludes from even the fraud and manipulation provisions of the CEA any &quot;individually negotiated&quot; transaction in a non-agricultural commodity between &quot;eligible contract participants&quot; not executed on a &quot;trading facility&quot;. Thus, the exclusion from provisions of the CEA for &quot;eligible contract participants&quot; is broader than the Section 2(h)(1) exemption for &quot;bilateral swaps&quot; of energy commodities. The criteria for this exclusion, however, are narrower in requiring &quot;individual negotiation&quot;.

This exclusion was not contained in either H.R. 4541 or S. 2697 as introduced in Congress. The House Banking and Financial Services Committee added this provision to the amended H.R. 4541 it reported to the House. That language was included in H.R. 4541 as passed by the House. Its final version was modified to conform to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act definition of &quot;swap agreement&quot;. That definition requires that the swap be &quot;individually negotiated&quot;. H.R. 4541 had required that each &quot;material economic term&quot; be individually negotiated.

2002 Senate hearings indicated CEA Section 2(h)(2) was not the &quot;Enron Loophole&quot; used by EnronOnline. That facility was not required to qualify as an &quot;electronic trading facility&quot; under Section 2(h)(2) of the CEA because Enron Online was only used to enter into transactions with Enron affiliates. There were not &quot;multiple participants&quot; on both the buy and sell sides of the trades. Whether such Enron-only trades were covered by the Section 2(h)(1) &quot;bilateral swaps market&quot; exemption for energy products or the broader Section 2(g) exclusion for swaps generally depended whether there was &quot;individual negotiation&quot;.

===Bill Clinton===
In June 2013, film producer Charles Ferguson interviewed Bill Clinton who said he and Larry Summers couldn&#x27;t change Alan Greenspan&#x27;s mind and Congress then passed the Act with a veto-proof supermajority. Ferguson revealed that this was inaccurate and, he said, a lie, while commenting that he thought Clinton was &quot;a really good actor&quot;. In fact, Ferguson wrote, the Clinton Administration and Larry Summers lobbied for the Act and joined Robert Rubin in both privately and publicly attacking advocates of regulation.

== Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ==

On August 11, 2009, the Treasury Department sent to Congress proposed legislation titled the &quot;Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets Act of 2009.&quot; The Treasury Department stated that under this proposed legislation &quot;the OTC derivative markets will be comprehensively regulated for the first time.&quot;
To accomplish this &quot;comprehensive regulation&quot;, the proposed legislation would repeal many of the provisions of the CFMA, including all of the exclusions and exemptions that have been identified as the &quot;Enron Loophole&quot;. While the proposed legislation would generally retain the &quot;legal certainty&quot; provisions of the CFMA, it would establish new requirements for parties dealing in non-&quot;standardized&quot; OTC derivatives and would require that &quot;standardized&quot; OTC derivatives be traded through a regulated trading facility and cleared through regulated central clearing. The proposed legislation would also repeal the CFMA&#x27;s limits on SEC authority over &quot;security-based swaps.&quot;

On December 11, 2009, the House passed H.R. 4173, the so-called Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009, which included a revised version of the Treasury Department&#x27;s proposed legislation that would repeal the same provisions of the CFMA noted above.

In late April, 2010, debate began on the floor of the Senate over their version of the reform legislation and on July 21, 2010, H.R.4173 passed in the Senate and was signed into law as the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

<text>Inhalation (or inspiration) happens when air or other gases enter the lungs.

== Inhalation of air ==
Inhalation of air, as part of the cycle of breathing, is a vital process for all human life. The process is autonomic (though there are exceptions in some disease states) and does not need conscious control or effort. However, breathing can be consciously controlled or interrupted (within limits).

Breathing allows oxygen (which humans and a lot of other species need for survival) to enter the lungs, from where it can be absorbed into the bloodstream.

== Other substances – accidental ==
Examples of accidental inhalation includes inhalation of water (e.g. in drowning), smoke, food, vomitus and less common foreign substances (e.g. tooth fragments, coins, batteries, small toy parts, needles).

== Other substances – deliberate ==

=== Recreational use ===
Nitrous oxide (&quot;laughing gas&quot;) has been used recreationally since 1899 for its ability to induce euphoria, hallucinogenic states and relaxation, and is legal in some countries.

Helium can be inhaled to give the voice a reedy, duck-like quality, but this can be dangerous as the gas is an asphyxiant and displaces the oxygen needed for normal respiration. 

Various illegal gaseous, vapourised or aerosolized recreational drugs exist, and are classed as inhalants.

=== Medical use ===

==== Diagnostic ====

Various specialized investigations use the inhalation of known substances for diagnostic purposes. Examples include pulmonary function testing (e.g. nitrogen washout test, diffusion capacity testing (carbon monoxide, helium, methane)) and diagnostic radiology (e.g. radioactive xenon isotopes).

==== Therapeutic ====

Gases and other drugs used in anaesthesia include oxygen, nitrous oxide, helium, xenon, volatile anaesthetic agents. Medication for asthma, croup, cystic fibrosis and some other conditions.
== Mechanism ==
Inhalation begins with the contraction of the muscles attached to the rib cage; this causes an expansion in the chest cavity. Then takes place the onset of contraction of the thoracic diaphragm, which results in expansion of the intrapleural space and an increase in negative pressure according to Boyle&#x27;s law. This negative pressure generates airflow because of the pressure difference between the atmosphere and alveolus. 

The inflow of air into the lungs occurs via the respiratory airways. In health, these airways begin with the nose. It is possible to begin with the mouth, which is the backup breathing system. However, chronic mouth breathing leads to, or is a sign of, illness, and it does not have mucus in the mouth to trap the unwanted substance unlike the nostrils They end in the microscopic dead-end sacs(alveoli) always opened, though the diameters of the various sections can be changed by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The alveolar air pressure is therefore always close to atmospheric air pressure (about 100 kPa at sea level) at rest, with the pressure gradients that cause air to move in and out of the lungs during breathing rarely exceeding 2–3 kPa.

Other muscles that can be involved in inhalation include:
* External intercostal muscles
* Scalene muscles
* Sternocleidomastoid muscle
* Trapezius muscle

==Hyperinflation==
&quot;Hyperinflation&quot; or &quot;hyperaeration&quot; is where the lung volume is abnormally increased, with increased filling of the alveoli. This results in an increased radiolucency on X-ray, a reduction in lung markings and depression of the diaphragm. It may occur in partial obstruction of a large airway, as in e.g. congenital lobar emphysema, bronchial atresia and mucus plugs in asthma.

==Yoga==
Yogis such as B. K. S. Iyengar advocate both inhaling and exhaling through the nose in the practice of yoga, rather than inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. They tell their students that the &quot;nose is for breathing, the mouth is for eating.&quot;

<text>EA Digital Illusions CE AB (trade name: DICE) is a Swedish video game developer based in Stockholm. The company was founded in 1992 and has been a subsidiary of Electronic Arts since 2006. Its releases include the &quot;Battlefield&quot;, &quot;Mirror&#x27;s Edge&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront&quot; series. Through their Frostbite Labs division, the company also develops the Frostbite game engine.

== History ==
=== Foundation and early years (1992–2000) ===
Digital Illusions was founded in May 1992 by Olof &quot;Olle&quot; Gustafsson, Markus Nyström, Fredrik Liljegren and Andreas Axelsson, four friends and former members of The Silents, a demogroup that developed for Amiga systems. The four studied at Växjö University, thus DICE was established in Växjö.

=== Expansion (2000–2004) ===
In 2000, DICE acquired developer Refraction Games (developers of &quot;Codename Eagle&quot;). From the acquisition, DICE inherited the in-development &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;. Patrick Söderlund, who had founded Refraction Games in 1997, subsequently joined DICE as chief executive officer. This was followed with the merger of Sandbox Studios in April 2001. Sandbox Studios added 50 employees to DICE&#x27;s staff, amounting to 150 total employees. In September 2004, DICE also merged with Trauma Studios in New York City. Trauma Studios employed nine people at the time.

=== Acquisition by Electronic Arts (2006–present) ===
In November 2004, Electronic Arts (EA) announced their intent to purchase all outstanding shares in DICE at a price of per share, with the deal&#x27;s closing deadline scheduled for 27 December. At the time, EA owned 18.9% in DICE. Initially, the offer was rejected by shareholders representing 28% of DICE&#x27;s ownership on 15 December, after which EA adjusted its offer on 20 December, intending to only purchase 44.5% at the same price per share, extending the offer deadline to 20 January 2005. On 25 January 2005, shareholders agreed to the acquisition, and EA raised their ownership in DICE to 59.8%.

In March 2006, EA announced a new plan to acquire all outstanding shares in DICE for per share. The acquisition was completed on 2 October, with 2.6 million shares in DICE transferred to EA in exchange for a total of . Shortly following the acquisition, on 5 October, EA closed Digital Illusions Canada, DICE&#x27;s Ontario-based studio. The 25 employees working at the studio at the time were given the option to transfer to DICE&#x27;s headquarters in Stockholm or any other EA studio. DICE co-founder Liljegren announced on 16 October that he established RedJade as a successor to Digital Illusions Canada.

In May 2013, EA opened a new Los Angeles-based division for DICE known as DICE LA, helmed by former senior staff of EA&#x27;s previously closed studio Danger Close Games. DICE LA had generally been involved with support of DICE and other EA games and had not generated any title on their own. Vince Zampella of Respawn Entertainment (another EA studio) was named as the studio&#x27;s new lead in January 2020. Zampella had indicated at this time that they would likely become separate from DICE, and change their name to reflect this. DICE LA announced their new name, Ripple Effect Studios, in July 2021, but otherwise under management by Zampella, and while they will finish work on &quot;Battlefield 2042&quot;, will move in a new direction following its release.

On 2 December 2021 Electronic Arts announced that Vince Zampella, co-founder of Respawn Entertainment and head of Ripple Effect Studios, will oversee the &quot;Battlefield&quot; series going forward, with Ripple Effect leading the way in developing the franchise&#x27;s &quot;new experiences&quot;, instead of DICE. Along with the announcement, it was reported that DICE General Manager Oskar Gabrielson would be leaving EA, with Rebecka Coutaz, formerly Managing Director of Ubisoft Annecy, taking his place in the role.

This happens due to elastic properties of the lungs, as well as the internal intercostal muscles which lower the rib cage and decrease thoracic volume. As the thoracic diaphragm relaxes during exhalation it causes the tissue it has depressed to rise superiorly and put pressure on the lungs to expel the air. During forced exhalation, as when blowing out a candle, expiratory muscles including the abdominal muscles and internal intercostal muscles generate abdominal and thoracic pressure, which forces air out of the lungs.

Exhaled air is 4% carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration during the production of energy, which is stored as ATP. Exhalation has a complementary relationship to inhalation which together make up the respiratory cycle of a breath.

When a person loses weight, the majority of the weight is exhaled as carbon dioxide and water vapor.

==Exhalation and gas exchange==

The main reason for exhalation is to rid the body of carbon dioxide, which is the waste product of gas exchange in humans. Air is brought into the lungs through inhalation. Diffusion in the alveoli allows for the exchange of O2 into the pulmonary capillaries and the removal of CO2 and other gases from the pulmonary capillaries to be exhaled. In order for the lungs to expel air the diaphragm relaxes, which pushes up on the lungs. The air then flows through the trachea then through the larynx and pharynx to the nasal cavity and oral cavity where it is expelled out of the body. Exhalation takes longer than inhalation and it is believed to facilitate better exchange of gases. Parts of the nervous system help to regulate respiration in humans. The exhaled air is not just carbon dioxide; it contains a mixture of other gases. Human breath contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These compounds consist of methanol, isoprene, acetone, ethanol and other alcohols. The exhaled mixture also contains ketones, water and other hydrocarbons. 
It is during exhalation that the olfaction contribution to flavor occurs in contrast to that of ordinary smell which occurs during the inhalation phase.

==Spirometry==

Spirometry is the measure of lung function. The total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC), residual volume (RV), and vital capacity (VC) are all values that can be tested using this method. Spirometry is used to help detect, but not diagnose, respiratory issues like COPD, and asthma. It is a simple and cost effective screening method. Further evaluation of a person&#x27;s respiratory function can be done by assessing the minute ventilation, forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume (FEV). These values differ in men and women because men tend to be larger than women.

TLC is the maximum amount of air in the lungs after maximum inhalation. In men the average TLC is 6000 ml, and in women it is 4200 ml. FRC is the amount of air left in the lungs after normal exhalation. Men leave about 2400 ml on average while women retain around 1800 ml. RV is the amount of air left in the lungs after a forced exhalation. The average RV in men is 1200 ml and women 1100 ml. VC is the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled after a maximum inhalation. Men tend to average 4800 ml and women 3100 ml.

Smokers, and those with Asthma and COPD, have reduced airflow ability. People with asthma and COPD show decreases in exhaled air due to inflammation of the airways. This inflammation causes narrowing of the airways which allows less air to be exhaled. Numerous things cause inflammation; some examples are cigarette smoke and environmental interactions such as allergies, weather, and exercise. In smokers the inability to exhale fully is due to the loss of elasticity in the lungs. Smoke in the lungs causes them to harden and become less elastic, which prevents the lungs from expanding or shrinking as they normally would.

Dead space can be determined by two types of factors which are anatomical and physiological. Some physiological factors are having non-perfuse but ventilated alveoli, such as a pulmonary embolism or smoking, excessive ventilation of the alveoli, brought on in relation to perfusion, in people with chronic obstructive lung disease, and &quot;shunt dead space,&quot; which is a mistake between the left to right lung that moves the higher concentrations in the venous blood into the arterial side. The anatomical factors are the size of the airway, the valves, and tubing of the respiratory system. Physiological dead space of the lungs can affect the amount of dead space as well with factors including smoking, and diseases. Dead space is a key factor for the lungs to work because of the differences in pressures, but it can also hinder the person.

One of the reasons we can breathe is because of the elasticity of the lungs. The internal surface of the lungs on average in a non-emphysemic person is normally 63m2 and can hold about 5lts of air volume. Both lungs together have the same amount of surface area as half of a tennis court. Disease such as, emphysema, tuberculosis, can reduce the amount of surface area and elasticity of the lungs. Another big factor in the elasticity of the lungs is smoking because of the residue left behind in the lungs from the smoking. The elasticity of the lungs can be trained to expand further.

==Brain involvement==

Brain control of exhalation can be broken down into voluntary control and involuntary control. During voluntary exhalation, air is held in the lungs and released at a fixed rate. Examples of voluntary expiration include: singing, speaking, exercising, playing an instrument, and voluntary hyperpnea. Involuntary breathing includes metabolic and behavioral breathing.

===Voluntary expiration===

The neurological pathway of voluntary exhalation is complex and not fully understood. However, a few basics are known. The motor cortex within the cerebral cortex of the brain is known to control voluntary respiration because the motor cortex controls voluntary muscle movement. This is referred to as the corticospinal pathway or ascending respiratory pathway. The pathway of the electrical signal starts in the motor cortex, goes to the spinal cord, and then to the respiratory muscles. The spinal neurons connect directly to the respiratory muscles. Initiation of voluntary contraction and relaxation of the internal and external internal costals has been shown to take place in the superior portion of the primary motor cortex. Posterior to the location of thoracic control (within the superior portion of the primary motor cortex) is the center for diaphragm control. Studies indicate that there are numerous other sites within the brain that may be associated with voluntary expiration. The inferior portion of the primary motor cortex may be involved, specifically, in controlled exhalation. Activity has also been seen within the supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex during voluntary respiration. This is most likely due to the focus and mental preparation of the voluntary muscular movement.

Voluntary expiration is essential for many types of activities. Phonic respiration (speech generation) is a type of controlled expiration that is used every day. Speech generation is completely dependent on expiration, this can be seen by trying to talk while inhaling. Using airflow from the lungs, one can control the duration, amplitude, and pitch. While the air is expelled it flows through the glottis causing vibrations, which produces sound. Depending on the glottis movement the pitch of the voice changes and the intensity of the air through the glottis change the volume of the sound produced by the glottis.

===Involuntary expiration===

Involuntary respiration is controlled by respiratory centers within the medulla oblongata and pons. The medullary respiratory center can be subdivided into anterior and posterior portions. They are called the ventral and dorsal respiratory groups respectively. The pontine respiratory group consists of two parts: the pneumotaxic center and the apneustic center. All four of these centers are located in the brainstem and work together to control involuntary respiration. In our case, the ventral respiratory group (VRG) controls involuntary exhalation.

The neurological pathway for involuntary respiration is called the bulbospinal pathway. It is also referred to as the descending respiratory pathway. &quot;The pathway descends along the spinal ventralateral column. The descending tract for autonomic inspiration is located laterally, and the tract for autonomic expiration is located ventrally.&quot; Autonomic Inspiration is controlled by the pontine respiratory center and both medullary respiratory centers. In our case, the VRG controls autonomic exhalation. Signals from the VRG are sent along the spinal cord to several nerves. These nerves include the intercostals, phrenic, and abdominals. These nerves lead to the specific muscles they control. The bulbospinal pathway descending from the VRG allows the respiratory centers to control muscle relaxation, which leads to exhalation.

====Yawning====

Yawning is considered a non-respiratory gas movement. A non-respiratory gas movement is another process that moves air in and out of the lungs that do not include breathing. Yawning is a reflex that tends to disrupt the normal breathing rhythm and is believed to be contagious as well. The reason why we yawn is unknown. A common belief is that yawns are a way to regulate the body&#x27;s levels of O2 and CO2, but studies done in a controlled environment with different levels of O2 and CO2 have disproved that hypothesis. Although there is not a concrete explanation as to why we yawn, others think people exhale as a cooling mechanism for our brains. Studies on animals have supported this idea and it is possible humans could be linked to it as well. What is known is that yawning does ventilate all the alveoli in the lungs.

====Receptors====

Several receptor groups in the body regulate metabolic breathing. These receptors signal the respiratory center to initiate inhalation or exhalation. Peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the aorta and carotid arteries. They respond to changing blood levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and H+ by signaling the pons and medulla. Irritant and stretch receptors in the lungs can directly cause exhalation. Both sense foreign particles and promote spontaneous coughing. They are also known as mechanoreceptors because they recognize physical changes not chemical changes. Central chemoreceptors in the medulla also recognize chemical variations in H+. Specifically, they monitor pH change within the medullary interstitial fluid and cerebral spinal fluid.

==Yoga==
Yogis such as B. K. S. Iyengar advocate both inhaling and exhaling through the nose in the practice of yoga, rather than inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. They tell their students that the &quot;nose is for breathing, the mouth is for eating.&quot;

<text>L.E.G.I.O.N. is a science fiction comic book created by Keith Giffen, Bill Mantlo and Todd McFarlane and published by DC Comics. The principal subject of the comic book is a team of fictional extraterrestrial superheroes. The characters first appeared in &quot;Invasion!&quot; #1 (December 1988). The original series chronicled the formation and activity of an police force whose mission was to act as a peace-keeping force in their galaxy.

==Publication history==
===&quot;Invasion!&quot;===
The characters who went on to form L.E.G.I.O.N. were first introduced in the three-part miniseries &quot;Invasion!&quot;

Vril Dox, Garryn Bek, Strata, Lyrissa Mallor, and the Durlan appeared as prisoners of the Alien Alliance who helped stage a breakout from the Starlag, a prison spacecraft overseen by the alien race known as the Citadel.

===&quot;L.E.G.I.O.N.&quot;===
&quot;L.E.G.I.O.N. &#x27;89&quot; debuted in 1989 (as indicated by the title) and reached issue #70 (as &quot;L.E.G.I.O.N. &#x27;94&quot; in 1994). L.E.G.I.O.N. stands for Licensed Extra-Governmental Interstellar Operatives Network.

This series followed the adventures of Vril Dox and his allies after their escape from the Starlag in &quot;Invasion!&quot;. Dox takes his companions to Colu, where they overthrow the Computer Tyrants running the planet. They encounter the bounty hunter Lobo, who had been tracking Bek to exact revenge on him for having accidentally killed one of Lobo&#x27;s treasured space dolphins. Dox smoothly and swiftly turns Lobo into a valued ally. With this group, Dox decides to form an interplanetary police force. He bases his operation on the planet Cairn after a difficult and bloody coup against Cairn&#x27;s ruler, Bek&#x27;s father-in-law, whom Dox shoots point blank. The series follows the rise, heyday, and fall of this police force.

===&quot;R.E.B.E.L.S.&quot;===

As a consequence of the &quot;Zero Hour&quot; event, the original title was replaced by &quot;R.E.B.E.L.S. &#x27;94&quot; (Revolutionary Elite Brigade to Eradicate L.E.G.I.O.N. Supremacy) (beginning with issue #0), continuing the same storyline with basically the same characters. &quot;R.E.B.E.L.S. &#x27;96&quot; #17 was the last issue.

When L.E.G.I.O.N. is usurped by Vril Dox&#x27;s son Lyrl Dox (who went by the name of Brainiac 3), Dox and those members who remain loyal to him (Lobo, Phase, Strata, Stealth, and Borb) are forced to flee in a mysterious new ship in order to regroup and regain control of L.E.G.I.O.N. Telepath comes along unwillingly. Garv, Strata&#x27;s husband, unbalanced by not understanding recent events, becomes involved in a desire to get Strata back. Borb (who is in love with Stealth) sacrifices his life in order to protect his friends from an other-dimensional army of brain-stealing entities; the very ones that had created the ship they had been fleeing in. They soon name the ship the &#x27;Di&#x27;ib&#x27;, after an old L.E.G.I.O.N. hero.

The team has to fight old friends, such as Zena Moonstruk, Gigantus and Davroth. Behind the scenes help comes from old ally Marij&#x27;n and Captain Comet. The group also encounters the demonic entity Neron, who plays a critical role in the resolution of the main storyline providing the means to defeating Lyrl in exchange for the soul of a future generation of the Dox line.

The heroes regain control in the last issue, with Vril using the knowledge given to him by Neron to find a way to lobotomize his son, stripping him of his super-intelligence. Dox and Stealth retire to take care of Lyrl, whose brain has been reduced to that of a normal one-year-old, while Captain Comet is placed in charge of L.E.G.I.O.N.

===Post-series appearances===
In the 2004 &quot;Adam Strange&quot; (issues #5-8) and the later &quot;Rann/Thanagar War&quot; series (issues #1–6 and the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; special), Vril Dox has resumed control of L.E.G.I.O.N. and is using droids as officers. Adam Strange is pursued by the group in the pages of his own series, framed for the seeming destruction of Rann. Former L.E.G.I.O.N. members have been referred to in the subsequent &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; series, and many make a cameo appearance in one panel of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #1, although the lineup appears to be out of date (in addition to Darius&#x27; appearance on one of the screens, Bertron Diib is visible between several of the dialogue balloons). L.E.G.I.O.N. and Vril Dox are mentioned several times, although not shown, in &quot;Mystery in Space&quot; (2006) featuring Captain Comet. Dox plays a major role in the six-part &quot;Omega Men&quot; limited series (2006-2007).

===&quot;R.E.B.E.L.S.&quot; (second series)===

In 2009, &quot;R.E.B.E.L.S.&quot; returned as an ongoing series. According to writer Tony Bedard he originally &quot;pitched it as &quot;L.E.G.I.O.N.&quot; and then the Legion of Super-Heroes exploded... We needed a title to emphasize that, despite the distant connection to the Legion, this is its own book. We didn&#x27;t have to look far&quot;.

The new series opens with Dox a wanted criminal on the run from a L.E.G.I.O.N. made up of robotic constructs controlled by Silica, a living computer Dox had designed. While a robot-based, computer-controlled L.E.G.I.O.N. had made it easier for Dox to control the behavior of his police force throughout the 80 worlds under their protection (a common complaint of his in the first series), it also enabled the Star Conqueror (a.k.a. Starro) to wrest control of L.E.G.I.O.N. from Dox and make himself the de facto ruler of all the client worlds just by corrupting Silica. The first issues show Dox building his team based on instructions smuggled to him by Brainiac Five, a team that will be the prototype of the future Legion of Super-Heroes.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; reboot of DC&#x27;s continuity, L.E.G.I.O.N. still exists, but is unclear how much of its history remains intact. L.E.G.I.O.N. officers make a brief appearance in the Larfleeze backup story in &quot;Threshold&quot; #3. Stealth, a L.E.G.I.O.N. member in previous continuity, also appears in the main storyline of &quot;Threshold&quot;, although she is not affiliated with the organization.

<doc id="485595" wikidata="Q1528846" url="?curid=485595" title="Michael Starr (politician)">
<text>Michael Starr, (born Michael Starchewsky; November 15, 1910 – March 16, 2000) was a Canadian politician and the first Canadian cabinet minister of Ukrainian descent, his parents having emigrated from Halychyna (Galicia), then a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is now Western Ukraine.

==Life and career==
Born in Copper Cliff, Ontario, Starr was an alderman for the Oshawa City Council from 1944 to 1949. From 1949 to 1952, he was the mayor of Oshawa. In 1951, he ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

First elected to the House of Commons in 1952 as a Progressive Conservative, Starr was re-elected six times until he was narrowly defeated in the 1968 election by future New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Ed Broadbent. Starr served as Minister of Labour in the government of John Diefenbaker from 1957 to 1963, and served as Opposition House Leader from 1965 to 1968.

In 1967, Starr stood as a candidate at the PC leadership convention, but was eliminated on the second ballot.

When Robert Stanfield became leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1967, Starr became Leader of the Opposition for two months until Stanfield won a seat in the House through a by-election. He lost his seat by fifteen votes in 1968 to Ed Broadbent, failing to retake it in 1972.

From 1968 to 1972, he was a citizenship court judge in Toronto. Starr was appointed chairman of the Workers&#x27; Compensation Board of Ontario in 1973, and served in that position until 1980.

In 1979, Starr was appointed Honorary Colonel of The Ontario Regiment (RCAC), a reserve armoured regiment based in Oshawa, Ontario. He held this appointment until 1983.

He was invested into The Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, (Order of St. John to use its short title) as an Officer and subsequently promoted to the grade of Commander. He was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal, Canadian Centennial Medal, and the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal.

In 1983, an Ontario government building was named in Starr&#x27;s honour. The Michael J. Starr building at 33 King St W in Oshawa is seven floors, each floor with an acre of working space.

Starr is remembered for his work in furthering the cause of ethnic groups and minorities. He helped to build the policy of old age pensions for the Progressive Conservatives. He worked to make the national employment service more humane in its approach to the unemployed and, in his tenure as minister, extended unemployment insurance benefits to women and seasonal workers, and extended federal financial assistance to the provinces under the vocational training coordination act.

Starr died in Oshawa on March 16, 2000, at the age of 89; he was predeceased by his wife Anne Zaritsky, whom he married in 1933, and his son, Dr. Robert Starr. His daughter, Joan Nicol, survived him.

<doc id="485599" wikidata="Q3228623" url="?curid=485599" title="House leader">
<text>In Canada, each political party with representation in the House of Commons has a House leader who is a front bench member of Parliament (MP) and an expert in parliamentary procedure. The same representation is found in the provincial and territorial legislatures. The House leader is in charge of the party&#x27;s day-to-day business in the House of Commons of Canada (or provincial or territorial legislatures), and usually conducts negotiations with other parties on the conduct of bills and debates.

They also argue points of order before the speaker of the House. The &quot;House leader&quot; is not the same as the party leader, but is the leader&#x27;s senior deputy for House business in Opposition parties, including the Official Opposition. The government House leader is a senior Cabinet minister who navigates the government&#x27;s business in the House. This system is replicated in the various provincial legislatures. The position of House Leader is especially important during periods of minority government where no one party has control of the House and bills can only be passed with the agreement of multiple parties.

The prime minister of Canada and leader of the Official Opposition originally had these responsibilities. In 1944, however, as a result of the increasing burdens placed on government by the Second World War, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King delegated these responsibilities to another member of the Canadian Cabinet. In 1946, the position of government House leader was formally recognized.

The position of Opposition House leader evolved in the 1950s as each opposition party began to designate a particular MP to question the government House leader on upcoming House business. The title of Opposition House leader became official in 1963, and in 1974, a special annual indemnity was attached to the position of House leader in each of the opposition parties.

Notable Opposition House leaders include Stanley Knowles of the New Democratic Party and its predecessor, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation; Herb Gray of the Liberal Party (also a government House leader); and Erik Nielsen of the Progressive Conservative Party.

The Office of House Leader has also been instituted at the provincial level, in the provincial legislative assemblies.

The term &quot;House leader&quot; has also been used to describe a party&#x27;s parliamentary leader, who leads a political party in the House of Commons or a provincial legislature due to their either not being a party leader or the party leader not having a seat.

<text>Netlib is a repository of software for scientific computing maintained by AT&amp;T, Bell Laboratories, the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Netlib comprises many separate programs and libraries. Most of the code is written in C and Fortran, with some programs in other languages.

==History==

The project began with email distribution on UUCP, ARPANET and CSNET in the 1980s.

The code base of Netlib was written at a time when computer software was not yet considered merchandise. Therefore, no license terms or terms of use are stated for many programs. Before the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (and the earlier Copyright Act of 1976) works without an explicit copyright notice were public-domain software. Also, most of the Netlib code is work of US government employees and therefore in the public domain. While several packages therefore don&#x27;t have explicit waiver/anti-copyright statements, for instance, the SLATEC package has an explicit statement.

== Contents ==
Some well-known packages maintained in Netlib are:
*AMPL Solver Library (ASL)
*Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS)
*EISPACK
*LAPACK
*LINPACK
*MINPACK
*QUADPACK

The SLATEC package is special in that it comprises a number of other packages like BLAS and LINPACK.

==Other projects==
*GNU Scientific Library (GSL), written in C and distributed under the GNU General Public License

<doc id="485606" wikidata="Q130282" url="?curid=485606" title="Addenbrooke's Hospital">
<text>Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital is a large teaching hospital and research centre in Cambridge, England, with strong affiliations to the University of Cambridge. Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital is located on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus. It is run by Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and is a designated academic health science centre. It is also the East of England&#x27;s major trauma centre and was the first such centre to be operational in the United Kingdom.

==History==

The hospital was founded in 1766 on Trumpington Street with £4,500 from the will of Dr John Addenbrooke, a fellow of St Catharine&#x27;s College. In 1962 the first building was opened on its present site, on the southern edge of the city at the end of Hills Road. The last patient left the Trumpington Street site in 1984 and the site was redeveloped in the 1990s – it is now occupied by the Cambridge Judge Business School (in the former main building), as well as Browns Brasserie &amp; Bar (in the former adjacent outpatients building). A new elective care facility was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2004, It was built by Alfred McAlpine and designed by Llewelyn Davies Architects at a cost of £85 million and completed in spring 2007.

== Notable staff ==

* Margaret Morgan, (1864– ) matron, 1901–1904
* Alice Blomfield, (1866–1938) matron, 1905–1908

Both these matrons trained at The London Hospital under Eva Luckes. Luckes adopted Florence Nightingale&#x27;s belief that the new style of matron should be autonomous and solely responsible for their staff. However, as with the Guy&#x27;s Hospital Dispute these new style of matrons sometimes had issues with the acceptance of their autonomy. Morgan felt that she had an issue with the acceptance of her authority by some medical staff, and left after three years. Blomfield also experienced an unspecified problem between herself and the medical staff.

== Services ==
Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital provides a full range of clinical services, with two exceptions: cardiothoracic surgery is performed at the adjacent Royal Papworth Hospital (which re-located to the Cambridge Biomedical Campus in 2019); and maternity services are provided at the adjacent Rosie Hospital, which has a midwife-led birth unit and birth pool.

Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital is a designated major trauma centre. This was the first regional major trauma centre in England to become fully operational and was featured on the BBC documentary series &#x27;Life Savers&#x27; in 2013.

Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital is a tertiary referral centre for a number of specialities. It is one of the UK&#x27;s seven liver transplant centres and performs multivisceral transplants. It is a busy regional neurosurgical centre and has the largest neurological intensive care unit of its kind in Europe. It is also a centre of excellence for renal services, bone marrow transplantation, cleft lip and palate reconstruction, treatment of rare cancers, medical genetics, and paediatrics. Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital is also the designated regional centre for pancreatic, biliary and liver cancer surgery and tertiary referral centre for complex pancreatitis. It has 37 operating theatres, and in addition to the neurosciences (neurosurgery and neurology) critical care unit it also has an adult, a paediatric, and a neonatal intensive care service, and several high-dependency areas (adult, paediatric, transplant, surgical, coronary care).

Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital is an internationally renowned transplant centre. Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital transplant surgeons have made many notable contributions to the world of transplantation.

The Cambridge Biomedical Campus has an on-site helipad, for the numerous air ambulances that visit - often transporting patients in a critical state to the major trauma centre at Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital.

==Transport==
===Bus===
The campus is served by a busy bus station, located on its gateway roundabout, with up to 60 buses arriving there every hour. Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital is directly accessible from three of Cambridge&#x27;s five Park and Ride sites, of which Babraham Road and Trumpington are nearest. The green Park and Ride buses from the Babraham Park and Ride stop at its main bus station, while the busway service A connects various locations around the site to Trumpington Park and Ride and the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway network. Busway service U from and to Eddington has a stop at the Madingley Road Park and Ride and one outside the hospital&#x27;s outpatient entrance. All three services also stop at the Cambridge railway station.

===Bicycle===
Various cycleways lead to Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital and a new cycleway and footpath linking Great Shelford and Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital opened in August 2006, which also marks the 10,000th mile of the National Cycle Network.

===Car===
Parking is increasingly restricted, as former car parks are being built on, and staff, patients and visitors are encouraged to travel in by bus or bike. A new multi-storey car park with 1050 spaces for visitor and patient parking and a further 63 for disabled parking was opened on 18 April 2008. There is a customer service desk and concession tickets are available for outpatients with appointments.

Transport remains something of a problem due to the volume of people arriving each day. There are approximately 8,000 car movements each day, but only 3,200 car parking spaces available (as of March 2004). With three proposed developments around the hospital, including an extension of the hospital site itself and two residential developments, traffic is expected to increase considerably. For this reason, work for a new access road from Hauxton Road in Trumpington to Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital began in July 2007. The £25million new road opened in October 2010 and provides direct access from the M11 to the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, home to the hospital. It is expected to handle up to 25,000 journeys per day when nearby residential developments are complete. The route was originally intended for access to the hospital only and as such, entrances to the Cambridge Biomedical Campus are fitted with Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras to monitor traffic entering and leaving the site without stopping. The police have power to issue Fixed Penalty Notices to drivers who are not authorised to use the route.

===Rail===
The nearest railway station to the campus is . A new station, , is intended to serve the campus from 2025 onwards.

==Open days==
The hospital holds a free open day to allow members of the public to visit areas of the hospital which would usually be inaccessible. The tours include visits to the basement service corridors, the hospital&#x27;s mortuary, the pathology laboratories, the hospital roof, and one of the operating theatres. In March 2016, over 5,000 visitors attended the event.

==Fundraising==

Addenbrooke&#x27;s Charitable Trust (ACT) is the independent registered charity for Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital and its associated hospitals. Its aim is to support and promote the work of Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital for the benefit of patients and staff, by raising extra funds to enhance services, facilities and research.

==Incidents==
In 2010 the Hospital carried out CT scan on mummified child dating from the third century AD in the collection of Saffron Walden Museum.

In 2011 an Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital doctor placed a “do not resuscitate” instruction on a patient&#x27;s notes without consultation with either the patient or the family. The patient later died, and following a court case in 2014 Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital was found to have acted unlawfully in denying the patient life saving treatment.

In 2012, Dr Narinder Kapur, consultant neuropsychologist and Head of the Neuropsychology Service won a case of unfair dismissal against Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Kapur raised patient-safety concerns, such as the use of unqualified staff in clinics, which were later vindicated by an internal report.

In 2015 an Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital doctor was jailed for 22 years for abusing 18 boys at the hospital, between 2009 and 2013.

In April 2016 Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital was criticised for the treatment of Prof. Sir David J.C. Mackay. Mackay was unable to sleep, being kept awake by noisy staff, excessive heating, lights, and loud machinery that exceeded World Health Organization guidelines. Mackay was reported to be in tears, and died six days later.

In 2016, Joan Hawes, who had attended Addenbrookes A&amp;E with a suspected deep vein thrombosis, was reportedly discharged without investigations for deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or Venous thrombosis, and died overnight at home.

In April 2021 a United States Air Force CV22 Osprey helicopter damaged the hospital helipad as it took off. East Anglian Air Ambulance and Magpas were temporarily diverted to Cambridge City Airport while the site was cleared of debris.

In May 2023, a member of staff working as a consultant physician was reported to have inappropriately accessed medical records to obtain personal details relating to their former partner&#x27;s new partner.

<text>The &quot;King George V&quot;-class battleships were the most modern British battleships in commission during the Second World War. Five ships of this class were built: HMS &quot;King George V&quot; (commissioned 1940), HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; (1941), HMS &quot;Duke of York&quot; (1941), HMS &quot;Anson&quot; (1942) and HMS &quot;Howe&quot; (1942). The names honoured King George V, and his sons, Edward VIII, who had been Prince of Wales, and George VI who was Duke of York before ascending to the throne; the final two ships of the class were named after prominent 18th century admirals of the Royal Navy.

The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited all of the number, displacement, and armament of warships built following its ratification, and this was extended by the First London Naval Treaty but these treaties were due to expire in 1936. With increased tension between Britain, the United States, Japan, France and Italy, it was supposed by the designers of these battleships that the treaty might not be renewed and the ships of the &quot;King George V&quot; class were designed with this possibility in mind.

All five ships saw combat during World War II, with &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; being involved in the action on 24 May to 27 May 1941 that resulted in the German battleship being sunk. Following this, on 25 October 1941, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was sent to Singapore, arriving on 2 December and becoming the flagship of Force Z. On 10 December, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was attacked by Japanese bombers and sank with the loss of 327 of its men. In the aftermath of the sinking, &quot;King George V&quot;, &quot;Duke of York&quot;, &quot;Howe&quot; and &quot;Anson&quot; provided escort duty to convoys bound for Soviet Union. On 1 May 1942, &quot;King George V&quot; collided with the destroyer HMS &quot;Punjabi&quot;, resulting in &quot;King George V&quot; being sent to Gladstone docks for repairs on 9 May, before returning to escort duty on 1 July 1942. In October 1942 &quot;Duke of York&quot; was sent to Gibraltar as the new flagship of Force H and supported the Allied landings in North Africa in November. &quot;Anson&quot; and &quot;Howe&quot; would also provide cover for multiple convoys bound for Soviet Union from late 1942 until 1 March 1943, when &quot;Howe&quot; provided convoy cover for the last time. In May 1943 &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Howe&quot; were moved to Gibraltar in preparation for Operation Husky. The two ships bombarded Trapani naval base and Favignana on 11–12 July and also provided cover for Operation Avalanche on 7 to 14 September. During this time, &quot;Duke of York&quot; and &quot;Anson&quot; participated in Operation Gearbox, which was designed to draw attention away from Operation Husky. &quot;Duke of York&quot; was also instrumental in sinking the German battleship on 26 December 1943. This battle was also the last time that British and German capital ships fought each other.

In late March 1945, &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Howe&quot; were sent to the Pacific with other Royal Navy vessels as a separate group to function with the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Task Force 57. On 4 May 1945, &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Howe&quot; led a forty-five-minute bombardment of Japanese air facilities in the Ryukyu Islands. &quot;King George V&quot; fired her guns in anger for the last time in a night bombardment of Hamamatsu on 29 and 30 July 1945. &quot;Duke of York&quot; and &quot;Anson&quot; were also dispatched to the Pacific, but arrived too late to participate in hostilities. On 15 August &quot;Duke of York&quot; and &quot;Anson &quot;accepted the surrender of Japanese forces occupying Hong Kong and, along with &quot;King George V&quot;, were present for the official Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay. Following the end of World War II, the ships were phased out of service and by 1957 all of the ships had been sold off for scrap, a process that was completed by 1958.

== Design and description ==
The &quot;King George V&quot; class was the result of a design process that began in 1928. Under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, a &quot;holiday&quot; from building capital ships was in force to 1931. The battleships of the British Navy consisted of only those old battleships that had been kept after the end of World War I, plus the two new, albeit slow, s. In 1928, the Royal Navy started considering the requirements for the warships that it expected to start building in 1931.

The First London Naval Treaty of 1930 extended the &quot;shipbuilding holiday&quot; to 1937. Planning began again in 1935, drawing on previous work. The new class would be built up to the Treaty maximum displacement of . Alternatives with 16 in (406 mm), 15 in (381 mm), and 14 in (356 mm) main guns were considered and the 15 in (381 mm) armament was chosen. Most designs were intended to steam at with full power, and it was decided that the likely decisive range in a battle would be from . Armour and torpedo protection formed a much greater portion of the design than that of the previous Royal Navy battleships.

In October 1935, the decision was made to use 14 in (356 mm) guns. The United Kingdom was negotiating for a continuation of the Naval Treaties with the other parties of the London Treaty. The British Government favoured a reduction in the maximum calibre of battleship gun to 14 in (356 mm) and in early October, the government learned that the United States would support this position if the Japanese could also be persuaded to do so. Since the large naval guns needed to be ordered by the end of the year, the British Admiralty decided on these guns for the &quot;King George V&quot; class. The Second London Naval Treaty, a result of the Second London Naval Conference begun in December 1935, was signed in March 1936 by the United States, France and Britain and this set a main battery of 14 in (356 mm) naval guns as the limit.

=== Propulsion ===
The &quot;King George V&quot;s were the first British battleships to alternate engine rooms and boilers in the machinery spaces, which reduced the likelihood of one hit causing the loss of all power. The machinery was arranged in four engine (turbine) rooms and four boiler rooms, with the eight machinery compartments alternating in pairs of engine or boiler rooms. Each pair of boiler rooms formed a unit with a pair of engine rooms. Nominal full power was with steam at . The machinery was designed to operate at an overload power of and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″ &quot;...main machinery steamed at overload powers of with no difficulties...&quot; during the hunt for the &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The Admiralty 3-drum boilers operated very efficiently, and similar boilers of nearly identical power, fitted to the older battleship during her rebuilding in 1937 achieved a full-power specific fuel consumption of 0.748 lb per shp on trials which compared favourably with contemporary battleships. During her full-power trials on 10 December 1940, &quot;King George V&quot; at displacement achieved with at 230 rpm and a specific fuel consumption of 0.715 lb per shp.

&quot;King George V&quot; had her paravanes streamed during her full power trials, which caused an estimated .7 knot loss of speed. The &quot;Duke of York&quot; at her trials, on 1 November 1941, displacing (sea slight, wind moderate), attained a speed of at 115 rpm and and at 232 rpm and . After 1942 the Royal Navy was forced to use fuel oils with considerably higher viscosity and greater seawater content than these boilers could efficiently use. The poor quality of the oil fuel combined with the seawater contamination reduced the efficiency of the steam power plant and increased the maintenance required. By 1944 the specific full-power fuel consumption had increased to 0.8 lb per shp, and boiler maintenance was becoming increasingly difficult. The Admiralty had been aware of this problem and were designing new types of oil sprayers and burners that could burn fuel oil much more efficiently, and sometime after 1944, &quot;Duke of York&quot; and &quot;Anson&quot; were fitted with new, higher-pressure oil sprayers and burners that restored the boilers to full efficiency. The same oil sprayers and burners were used in along with other detail improvements so that &quot;Vanguard&quot; achieved a full-power specific fuel consumption of 0.63 lb per shp while using the same steam pressures and temperatures as used on the &quot;King George V&quot; class.

=== Protection ===

The armour protection of the &quot;King George V&quot;-class battleships was designed after consideration of the Royal Navy&#x27;s experience of the First World War and upon testing between the wars. The design of this class was dominated by the provision of protection. Magazine protection was given priority with a thick belt and deck armour and by placing the magazines at the lowest levels of the ship.

The horizontal protection over the magazines consisted of three layers with a total thickness of ; the weather deck consisted of of Ducol (D) steel, the main armoured deck was of non-cemented steel armour thick over a D steel deck and above the shell rooms there was another 1.5-inch splinter deck. The powder magazines were below the shell rooms for added protection, a practice that was begun with the &quot;Nelson&quot;-class battleships. The weather deck thickness was the same over the machinery spaces but there the main armoured deck was reduced to over a D steel deck. The main armoured deck was continued forward of the forward armoured bulkhead and gradually reduced from full thickness to , while aft of the after magazines an armoured turtle-back deck covered the steering gear with of armour whilst also providing protection along the waterline.

The main armour belt was high and covered the hull side from the main armoured deck to finish below the deep waterline. Post-World War I studies had indicated that it was possible for delayed-action AP shells to dive under a shallow belt and penetrate into vital areas of the ship and therefore the main belt was made to extend as far below the waterline as possible. Along the ship, the belt started just forward of the forward turret and finished just aft of the aft turret. The armour consisted of three equal-depth strakes. The strakes were tongue-and-grooved together, and each individual plate in a strake was keyed into neighbouring plates. The belt was at its thickest above and at the waterline. Most secondary and some primary sources describe the maximum thickness of the belt armour varying between 14 and 15 inches (possibly due to rounding to the nearest inch). Some sources give more detail: along the magazines, the belt was 14.7 inches thick (373 mm) cemented armour, laminated onto 1 inch (25.4 mm) of &quot;composition material&quot; (cement) and an additional 0.875 inch (22.2 mm) of Ducol steel hull plating (this steel was also effective as armour), over the machinery spaces, the belt was 13.7 inches (349 mm). The lower section of belt tapered to a thickness of between 4.5 in and 5.5 in. Armour protection was even better than the thickness of armour would indicate due to the improved qualities of the British cemented armour which provided excellent resistance. The armoured belt, together with armoured bulkheads fore and aft and the armoured main deck, formed an &quot;armoured citadel&quot; protecting magazines and machinery. The armoured bulkhead was 12 in (305 mm) thick forward and 10 in (254 mm) thick at the after end of the citadel The main armoured belt extended forward and aft of the main armoured bulkheads with reduced height to protect the waterline and gradually reduced in thickness from 13 to 5.5 inches. Immune zone calculations vary widely from source to source. The armour provision was designed to offer protection from guns of a greater calibre than the class mounted themselves, and was on a scale second to none at the time the ships were designed. Indeed, the armour protection of these vessels was to be subsequently exceeded only by the Japanese battleships of the.

The main gun turrets were relatively lightly protected in comparison to contemporary battleships. Extensive levels of flash protection were employed. Maximum turret and barbette armour was reduced to 12.75 inches in this class from the 16 inches of the &quot;Nelson&quot; class. The turret faces had 12.75 in (324 mm) of armour at the front; sides (at the gun chamber); 6.86 inches (284–174 mm) on the sides and rear; the roof plate was 5.88 in (149 mm) thick. The main armament barbettes were of varying thickness: 12.75 in (324 mm) thick on the sides, 11.76 in (298 mm) forward and 10.82 in (275 mm) aft of the turret. To some extent the higher quality of the armour minimized the loss of protection and the turret&#x27;s flat face improved ballistic resistance at long ranges, while the low profile of the turret minimized target area at closer ranges. The reduction in turret and barbette armour was a compromise in favour of the thickest possible protection for the magazines. The extensive anti-flash protection in the turrets and barbettes was designed to ensure that the magazines would remain safe even if the turrets and/or barbettes were penetrated. The secondary gun mounts, casements and handling rooms received only light plating of 0.98 in (25 mm) to protect against splinters.

Unlike contemporary foreign battleships and the preceding &quot;Nelson&quot;-class battleships, the &quot;King George V&quot; class had comparatively light conning tower protection with 4-inch (102 mm) sides, 3 in (75 mm) forward and aft and a 1.47 in (38 mm) roof plate. The RN&#x27;s analysis of World War I revealed that command personnel were unlikely to use an armoured conning tower, preferring the superior visibility of unarmoured bridge positions Stability and weight considerations clearly played an important part in the British decision to limit superstructure armour. The conning tower armour was sufficient to protect against smaller ship guns and shell fragments.

==== Underwater protection ====

The hull below the waterline, along the main armour belt, formed the side protection system (SPS). It was subdivided into a series of longitudinal compartments in a void-liquid-void layout; the outer and inner were filled with air, and the middle compartment with liquid (fuel or water). The outer hull plating in the region of the SPS was thin to reduce potential splinter damage from a torpedo. The outer compartment of the SPS was normally an empty or &#x27;void&#x27; space (containing only air) and this allowed the initial explosion from a torpedo to expand while minimizing damage to the ship. The centre compartment was filled with oil or seawater and this spread the pressure pulse over a larger area while the liquid contained any metal splinters that were created from the torpedo explosion. The inboard compartment was another void space and served to contain any liquid leaking from the liquid layer and any remaining pressure pulse from the torpedo explosion.

Inboard of the final void space was an armoured bulkhead which varied in thickness from 1.5 in (37 mm) over the machinery spaces to 1.75 inch (44 mm) abreast of the magazines. This bulkhead formed the &quot;holding bulkhead&quot; and it was designed to resist the residual blast effects from the torpedo hit. If this final inner bulkhead was penetrated a further set of subdivided compartments would contain any leaks; inboard of the holding bulkhead the ship was highly subdivided into small compartments containing auxiliary machinery spaces. The SPS void-liquid-void layer was generally about 13 feet wide, and the auxiliary machinery spaces added approximately another 8 feet of space from the outer hull plating to the major machinery spaces. The only exception to this was abreast A and B Engine Rooms, where the auxiliary machinery spaces were omitted, but another void space, about three feet wide was substituted in its place.

Above the SPS, and directly behind the armour belt, was a series of compartments, typically used for washrooms or storage spaces, which were designed to allow for upward venting of over-pressure from a torpedo hit. This scheme was designed to protect against a 1000 lb warhead, and had been tested and found effective in full-scale trials. The SPS was also a key component of the ship&#x27;s damage control system, as lists resulting from flooding could be corrected by counterflooding empty void spaces, and/or draining normally liquid filled compartments. In the case of the loss of the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; these spaces were used for counterflooding to reduce list.

 was sunk on 10 December 1941, from what was believed to have been hits by six aerial launched torpedoes and a 500 kg bomb. However, an extensive 2007 survey by divers of the wreck of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; determined definitively that there had been only 4 torpedo hits. Three of these four hits had struck the hull outside the area protected by the SPS. In the case of the fourth, the SPS holding bulkhead appeared intact abreast the area where the hull was hit.

The conclusion of the subsequent 2009 paper and analysis was that the primary cause of the sinking was uncontained flooding along &quot;B&quot; propeller shaft. The propeller shaft external shaft bracket failed, and the movement of the unsupported shaft then tore up the bulkheads all the way from the external propeller shaft gland through to B Engine Room itself. This allowed flooding into the primary machinery spaces. The damage and flooding was exacerbated by poor damage control and the premature abandonment of the after magazines and a telephone communications switchboard. &quot;B&quot; propeller shaft had been stopped, and then restarted several minutes after being struck by a torpedo. Subsequent inquiries into her loss at the time identified the need for a number of design improvements, which were implemented to a lesser or greater degree on the other four ships of the class. Ventilation and the watertightness of the ventilation system were improved, while internal passageways within the machinery spaces were redesigned and the communications system made more robust.

Improved propeller shaft glands and shaft locking gear were introduced. Some of the supposed failures of the ship were nevertheless predicated on the assumption that a torpedo had hit and defeated the SPS at or about frame 206 at the same time as the hit that damaged B propeller shaft. The 2007 survey&#x27;s video footage evidence showed however that the hull is basically intact in this area.

The inability to survey the wreck during the war no doubt frustrated efforts to arrive at a definitive cause for the loss of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and, subsequently, that somewhat flawed analysis has led to a number of incorrect theories regarding the reasons for the sinking being inadvertently disseminated over the years.

On examination of the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; after her encounter with the German battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser , three damaging hits were discovered which had caused about 400 tons of water, from all three hits, to enter the ship.

One of these hits, fired from &quot;Bismarck&quot;, had penetrated the torpedo protection outer bulkhead in a region very close to an auxiliary machinery space causing local flooding within the SPS, while the inner, 1.5-inch (2×19 mm) D-steel holding bulkhead remained intact, as the German shell was a dud. The German shell would have actually exploded in the water if its fuse had worked properly, due to the depth which the shell had to dive before striking the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; under her armoured belt.

=== Armament ===

==== Main armament ====
The &quot;King George V&quot; and the four other ships of the class as built carried ten BL 14 inch Mk VII naval guns, in two quadruple turrets fore and aft and a single twin turret behind and above the fore turret. There was debate within the Admiralty over the choice of gun calibre. There was a routine debate in the Admiralty over gun size, armour, speed, torpedo protection and AA firepower and the correct ratio between these attributes for the &quot;King George V&quot; battleships; other European powers preferred 15-inch and the U.S. 16-inch main guns. The Admiralty chose a ship with high speed, enhanced protection, heavy AA and ten 14-inch guns. The Admiralty controller wrote that a change to 15-inch guns would entail an 18-month delay (which would have meant no new RN battleships until 1942). Stephen Roskill noted that the London Naval Treaty stipulated a 14-inch maximum gun size, with an opt out clause, which Britain was very reluctant to exercise, since the Admiralty was hoping to persuade the other naval powers to stick to 14-inch guns, though there was little or no debate within Parliament. The Admiralty studied vessels armed with a variety of main armaments including nine guns in three turrets, two forward and one aft. While this was well within the capability of British shipyards, the design was quickly rejected as they felt compelled to adhere to the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936 and there was a serious shortage of skilled technicians and ordnance designers, along with compelling pressures to reduce weight.

The class was designed to carry twelve 14-inch guns in three quadruple turrets and this configuration had a heavier broadside than the nine 15-inch guns. It proved impossible to include this amount of firepower and the desired level of protection on a 35,000 ton displacement and the weight of the superimposed quadruple turret made the stability of the vessel questionable. The second forward turret was changed to a smaller two-gun turret in exchange for better armour protection, reducing the broadside weight to below that of the nine gun arrangement. The 14-inch Armour Piercing (AP) shell also carried a proportionally large bursting charge of . The armour-piercing capability of the gun and its ammunition is exhibited by the conning tower on the wreck of the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, provided with 14-inch thick armour, which is said to resemble a &quot;Swiss cheese&quot;. The last naval treaty had an escalator clause that permitted a change to 16-inch guns if another signatory did not conform to it by 1 January 1937. Although they could have invoked this clause, the effect would have been to delay construction and it was considered prudent to build with 14-inch rather than find themselves without the new battleships. The U.S. opted to absorb a delay and built its ships with larger guns. When comparing the British 14-inch gun to the heavier guns mounted on contemporary foreign battleships, the thicker armour of the British battleships tended to result in an equalisation of the relative penetrating power of respective shells.

In service, the quad turrets proved to be less reliable than was hoped for. Wartime haste in building, insufficient clearance between the rotating and fixed structure of the turret, insufficient full calibre firing exercises and extensive arrangements to prevent flash from reaching the magazines made it mechanically complex, leading to problems during prolonged actions. In order to bring ammunition into the turret at any degree of train, the design included a transfer ring between the magazine and turret; this did not have sufficient clearance to allow for the ship bending and flexing. Improved clearances, improved mechanical linkages, and better training led to greater reliability in the quadruple turrets but they remained problematic.

During the battle of the Denmark Strait against the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, the main battery of the newly commissioned &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; had mechanical problems: it started to fire three-round salvos instead of five-round salvoes, and there were problems in all except for the twin &#x27;B&#x27; turret. The main battery output was reduced to 74 percent (&quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; achieved 89% and 85% output, respectively) during the engagement, as out of seventy-four rounds ordered fired, only fifty-five were possible. &#x27;A&#x27; turret was taking in water leading to discomfort for its crew and &#x27;Y&#x27; turret jammed at salvo 20. The number of known defects in the main armament that was hampering 14-inch fire, the damage sustained and the worsening tactical situation forced Captain Leach to disengage from combat. With the range down to 14,500 yards and with five of his 14-inch guns out of action, Leach decided to break off his engagement with a superior enemy. Stephen Roskill in the &quot;War at Sea&quot; (the official British history of the Second World War at sea), Volume 1, describes the decision to turn away: &quot;In addition to the defective gun in her forward turret, another 4-gun turret was temporarily incapacitated by mechanical breakdowns. In these circumstances Leach decided to break off the action and, at 0613, turned away under cover of smoke.&quot; During the later action with &quot;Bismarck&quot;, was also having trouble with her main battery, and by 09:27 every gun missed at least one salvo due to failures in the safety interlocks for antiflash protection. John Roberts wrote of main gunnery problems encountered by &quot;King George V&quot;:

Initially &quot;King George V&quot; did well achieving 1.7 salvoes per minute while employing radar control but she began to suffer severe problems from 09:20 onward [Note: KGV had opened fire at 08:48 and fired for about 25 minutes at 1.7 salvoes per minute until 09:13, when the Type 284 radar broke down, but with no recorded loss of 14-inch gun output until 09:20.]. &#x27;A&#x27; turret was completely out of action for 30 minutes after firing about 23 rounds per gun, due to a jam between the fixed and revolving structure in the shell room and &#x27;Y&#x27; turret was out of action for 7 minutes due to drill errors... Both guns in B turret, guns 2 and 4 in &#x27;A&#x27; turret and gun 2 in &#x27;Y&#x27; turret were put out of action by jams and remained so until after the action – 5 guns out of 10! There were a multitude of other problems with mechanical failures and drill errors that caused delays and missed salvos. There were also some misfires – one gun (3 of &#x27;A&#x27; turret) misfired twice and was out of action for 30 minutes before it was considered safe to open the breech.

During the early part of her action against the German capital ship &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; at the Battle of the North Cape on 26 December 1943, , firing under radar control in poor weather, scored 31 straddles out of 52 broadsides fired and during the latter part she scored 21 straddles out of 25 broadsides, a very creditable gunnery performance. In total, &quot;Duke of York&quot; fired 450 shells in 77 broadsides. &quot;However, &quot;Duke of York&quot; still fired less than 70% of her possible output during this battle because of mechanical and &quot;errors in drill&quot; problems.&quot;

The &quot;King George V&quot;s were the only battleships designed for the Royal Navy to use 14-inch guns and turrets. (HMS &quot;Canada&quot;, originally designed for Chile, had used 14-inch guns during the First World War.)

==== Secondary armament ====

The QF 5.25 inch Mark I dual purpose gun has been dogged with controversy as well. The RN Gunnery Pocket Book published in 1945 states that: &quot;The maximum rate of fire should be 10–12 rounds per minute.&quot;. Wartime experience revealed that the maximum weight which the loading numbers could handle comfortably was much lower than 80–90 lb and the weight of the 5.25-inch ammunition caused serious difficulties, allowing them to manage only 7–8 rpm instead of the designed 10–12 rpm. The mount had a maximum elevation of +70 degrees and the slow elevating and training speeds of the mounts were inadequate for engaging modern high-speed aircraft. Despite this &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was credited with several 5.25-inch kills during Operation Halberd and damaged 10 of 16 high-level bombers in two formations during her last engagement, two of which crash landed. had her 5.25-inch turrets upgraded to RP10 control which increased training and elevating speeds to 20 degrees per second. These ships were equipped with the HACS AA fire control system and the Admiralty Fire Control clock for surface fire control of the secondary armament.

==== Anti-aircraft battery ====
The &quot;King George V&quot;-class design had four 0.5-inch quadruple machine gun mounts but in 1939 these were replaced by two Mark VI pom-poms. In 1940, to combat air attack, four Unrotated Projectile (rocket) mountings were fitted, one on &quot;B&quot; turret, two on &quot;Y&quot; turret and one replacing a pom-pom mount added in 1939 at the stern. The pom-poms in &quot;King George V&quot; were designed and produced by Vickers Armstrongs, as a result of a post-World War I requirement for a multiple mounting which was effective against close-range bombers or torpedo planes. The first model, tested in 1927, was a very advanced weapon for its time and in 1938 the Mark VI* had a muzzle velocity of 2,400 feet per second, a 1.6-inch bore and a barrel length of 40 calibres. The pom-poms fired 1.8-pound shells at a rate of 96–98 rounds per minute for controlled fire and 115 rounds per minute for automatic fire. The range of the Mark VI* was 6,800 yards, at a muzzle velocity of 2,300 feet per second. The Mark VI octuple mount weighed 16 tons and the Mark VII quadruple mount weighed 10.8 tons if power operated; it could be elevated to 80 degrees and depressed to 10 degrees at a rate of 25 degrees per second, which was also the rate of train. The normal ammunition supply on board for the Mark VI was 1,800 rounds per barrel. &quot;King George V&quot; introduced the Mk IV Pom-pom director to the Royal Navy in 1940, becoming the first ship in the world to feature gyroscopic target tracking in tachymetric anti-aircraft directors. The anti-aircraft battery of these ships was incrementally augmented throughout the war. The number and disposition of guns varying from ship to ship, &quot;King George V&quot; in September 1945 carrying: 8 Mark VI octuple pom-poms, 2 quadruple 40 mm Bofors Mk II (US), 2 single 40 mm Bofors, and 24 single 20 mm Oerlikon cannon.

==== Fire control ====
The main guns of the &quot;King George V&quot;-class ships were controlled via two director control towers, one on top of the bridge superstructure and one aft of the mainmast. Each of the control towers was equipped with 15 foot rangefinders and fed targeting information to an Admiralty Fire Control Table, Mk IX. In the event that the control towers were disabled both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; turrets had internal 41 foot rangefinders whilst &quot;B&quot; turret had 30 foot rangefinders. The first two ships of the class to be completed, &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, carried four HACS Mk IVGB directors for the ship&#x27;s secondary 5.25-inch guns as well as six Mk IV pom-pom directors; all ten of these directors featured Gyro Rate Unit, tachymetric fire control. &quot;Duke of York&quot; and &quot;Howe&quot; had HACS Mk V directors, with &quot;Anson&quot; having the Mk V directors replaced by the updated Mk VI.

=== Battle of the Denmark Strait (actions against &quot;Bismarck&quot;) ===
&quot;King George V&quot; was the first ship of the class to join the Home Fleet on 11 December 1940 and her first action was providing distant cover for Operation Claymore in February 1941, before escorting Atlantic convoys HX 114 and HX 115 during March. Owing to the threat of the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, the Home Fleet sent &quot;King George V&quot; and the newly completed &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; on 22 May to help locate &quot;Bismarck&quot;, along with the battlecruiser and six destroyers. On 24 May, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Hood&quot; made contact with &quot;Bismarck&quot; and opened fire at 26,000 yards. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″ sixth salvo straddled &quot;Bismarck&quot; and it was during this salvo, and one other, that she landed two decisive hits, holing &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s bow, flooding a generator room and an auxiliary boiler room, and forcing the critical shutdown of two of her boilers, which led to &quot;Bismarck&quot; making the fateful decision to attempt to return to port. During this time &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; had been solely targeting &quot;Hood&quot; and at 06:01 &quot;Hood&quot; blew up and sank, with the loss of all but three of her complement of 1,419 officers and men.

Following this, Captain Leach of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; gave the order to disengage, laying a heavy smokescreen to facilitate the retreat. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; would attempt to reengage &quot;Bismarck&quot; on two more occasions, but was unable to land any further hits owing to the distance being in excess of 20,000 yards, and was then forced to return to Iceland for refueling and would play no further part in actions against the German battleship. Meanwhile, &quot;King George V&quot; on 24 May was still 300 to 400 miles away from &quot;Bismarck&quot; and it was not until 27 May that &quot;King George V&quot; and were able to engage &quot;Bismarck&quot;, due to a Swordfish torpedo bomber disabling &quot;Bismarck&quot;&#x27;s steering gear on 26 May. During the engagement &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Rodney&quot; were able to relatively quickly disable the main armament turrets and fire-control systems of &quot;Bismarck&quot;, rendering her unable to effectively engage the British ships; later they closed to point-blank range. After 32 minutes of firing &quot;King George V&quot; had fired 335 14-inch shells at &quot;Bismarck&quot;, scoring multiple hits that contributed to &quot;Bismarck&quot; sinking soon after.

=== Sinking of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; ===

After being repaired at Rosyth, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; transported Prime Minister Winston Churchill to Canada for a conference with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, that resulted in the Atlantic Charter being declared, which laid out how the allies intended to deal with the post-war world, on 14 August 1941. Following the declaration of the charter, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; on 24 September provided escort for Operation Halberd, with &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; downing several Italian aircraft on 27 September. On 25 October 1941, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; departed home waters bound for Singapore, with orders to rendezvous with the battlecruiser &quot;Repulse&quot; and the aircraft carrier &quot;Indomitable&quot;; however, &quot;Indomitable&quot; ran aground in Jamaica and was unable to proceed. On 2 December the group docked in Singapore and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; then became the flagship of the ill-fated Force Z under Admiral Sir Tom Phillips.

The force then diverted to British Malaya as they had received intelligence that Japanese forces were landing there, however, this was a diversion and on 10 December the force was spotted by a Japanese submarine. At 11:00 the first Japanese air attack began against the force and at 11:30 &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was struck by a torpedo. This led to rapid flooding, as the port outer propeller shaft had been damaged; high-speed rotation of this unsupported propeller shaft destroyed the sealing glands around it, allowing water to pour into the hull. The ship subsequently began to take on a heavy list. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was hit by three more torpedoes, before a 500 kg (1100 lb) bomb hit the catapult deck, penetrating through to the main deck before exploding in the makeshift aid centre causing numerous casualties. Several other bombs from this attack were very &quot;near misses&quot;, which indented the hull, popped rivets and caused hull plates to &quot;split&quot; along their seams which intensified the flooding aboard &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. At 13:15 the order was given to abandon ship and at 13:20 &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; capsized and sank with Admiral Phillips and Captain Leach being among the 327 fatalities. The wreck lies upside down in of water at .

=== Convoy duty ===

In October, &quot;King George V&quot; was involved in Operation EJ, which involved escorting the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Victorious&quot;, whose aircraft attacked German shipping in the Glomfjord. &quot;Duke of York&quot;, the third ship of the class, first saw action on 1 March 1942, when she provided close escort for convoy PQ 12 and was later joined by &quot;King George V&quot; on 6 March, as Admiral John Tovey believed that the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; would attempt to intercept the convoy; however, aircraft from &quot;Victorious&quot; were able to prevent &quot;Tirpitz&quot; from leaving her base in Norway. During escort duty on 1 May 1942 &quot;King George V&quot; collided with the destroyer &quot;Punjabi&quot;, cutting &quot;Punjabi&quot; in two and damaging 40 feet of her own bow, resulting in &quot;King George V&quot; being sent to Gladstone Dock for repairs on 9 May before resuming escort duty on 1 July 1942. When the last two ships in the class, &quot;Howe&quot; and &quot;Anson&quot;, were completed in late 1942, they were assigned to provide cover for convoys bound for Russia. On 12 September, &quot;Anson&quot; was joined by &quot;Duke of York&quot; in providing distant cover for convoy QP. 14. In October, &quot;Duke Of York&quot; was sent to Gibraltar to support the Allied landings in North Africa in November. On 31 December, &quot;Howe&quot; and &quot;King George V&quot; provided distant cover for Arctic convoy RA 51.

=== Battle of the North Cape ===

&quot;Anson&quot; covered her last convoy on 29 January 1943, before being relocated, with &quot;Duke of York&quot;, to the Mediterranean. In June 1943, the two battleships took part in Operation Gearbox, which was designed to draw attention away from Operation Husky. At the same time, &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Howe&quot; were also relocated to the Mediterranean. They bombarded Trapani naval base on 12 July and defended Algiers against an air raid, before departing to take part in Operation Avalanche. Between 9 and 11 September they provided support for Operation Slapstick and later escorted the surrendered Italian fleet to Malta.

When the German battleship was relocated to Norway, it was deemed necessary to provide more protection for all convoys bound for Russia. On 25 December, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was reported at sea. Initial contact was made the following day by the cruisers of Force 1 (, and ) but following a brief engagement, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was able to outdistance the cruisers.
Force 2, which included &quot;Duke of York&quot;, was able to close the range and &quot;Duke of York&quot; opened fire on &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, scoring hits at ranges in excess of 12,000 yards. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; scored two hits upon &quot;Duke of York&quot; during the engagement, both of which hit masts and failed to explode. One of &quot;Duke of York″&quot;s shells exploded in &quot;Scharnhorst″&quot;s number one boiler room, slowing her significantly and allowing British destroyers to close to torpedo range. Their torpedo hits allowed &quot;Duke of York&quot; to close to a range of 10,400 yards before opening fire once again. All &quot;Scharnhorst″s&quot; turrets were silenced and shortly afterwards &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; sank with the loss of over 1,700 men.

Following this, on 29 March 1944, &quot;Duke of York&quot; provided cover for convoy JW 58 and in August &quot;Duke of York&quot; and &quot;Anson&quot; provided cover for the aircraft carrier &quot;Furious&quot;, while she carried out air strikes against German targets in Norway as part of Operation Bayleaf. On 3 April, &quot;Duke of York&quot; provided cover for Operation Tungsten, which succeeded in damaging the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;.

=== Far East deployment ===

In late March 1945, &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Howe&quot; began operations in the Pacific as part of Task Force 57. The first major operation that the task force undertook was Operation Iceberg, offshore support for the US landings at Okinawa, which started on 1 April. During the operation &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Howe&quot; were subjected to sporadic Japanese kamikaze attacks, however, no damage was inflicted upon them by these attacks, while &quot;Howe&quot; succeeded in downing an attacking kamikaze plane. On 4 May, the two battleships led a forty-five-minute bombardment of Japanese air facilities in Ryukyu Islands.

In mid-July, they joined US battleships in a bombardment of industrial installations at Hitachi. During the Okinawa campaign, the pair supported British carriers. Their last offensive action was a night bombardment of Hamamatsu on 29 to 30 July 1945. &quot;Duke of York&quot; and &quot;Anson&quot; arrived too late to take part in hostilities, but on 15 August they accepted the surrender of Japanese forces occupying Hong Kong. &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Duke of York&quot; were present at the official Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay. After the end of World War II, &quot;King George V&quot; became the flagship of the Home Fleet until December 1946, when she became a training vessel, before being scrapped in 1957. &quot;Duke of York&quot; became the flagship of the Home Fleet after &quot;King George V&quot;, until April 1949, before being scrapped in 1957. &quot;Howe&quot; returned to Portsmouth in January 1946 and spent the remainder of her career there before being scrapped in 1957. &quot;Anson&quot; briefly served as the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet and helped to re-occupy Hong Kong. In 1949 she was placed into reserve before being scrapped in 1957.

<text>HMS &quot;King George V&quot; (pennant number 41) was the lead ship of the five British battleships of the Royal Navy. Laid down in 1937 and commissioned in 1940, &quot;King George V&quot; operated during the Second World War in all three major naval theatres of war, the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Pacific, as part of the British Home Fleet and Pacific Fleets. In May 1941, along with , &quot;King George V&quot; was involved in the hunt for and pursuit of the , eventually inflicting severe damage which led to the German vessel&#x27;s sinking. On 1 May 1942 the destroyer sank after a collision with &quot;King George V&quot; in foggy conditions. &quot;King George V&quot; took part in Operation Husky (the allied landings in Sicily) and bombarded the island of Levanzo and the port of Trapani. She also escorted part of the surrendered Italian Fleet, which included the battleships and , to Malta. In 1945 &quot;King George V&quot; took part in operations against the Japanese in the Pacific.

&quot;King George V&quot; was made flagship of the British Home Fleet on 1 April 1941, she remained so during the rest of the war and became a training battleship in November 1947.

== Design ==

=== General characteristics ===
&quot;King George V&quot; was built by Vickers-Armstrong at Walker Naval Yard, Newcastle upon Tyne; she was laid down on 1 January 1937, launched on 21 February 1939 and commissioned on 11 December 1940. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She displaced 38,031 tons at normal load and 42,237 tons at full load. After her refit in 1944, she displaced 39,100 tons at standard load, and 44,460 tons at full load. She could carry 3,918 tons of fuel oil, 192 tons of diesel oil, 256 tons of reserve feed water and 444 tons of freshwater. Based on the designed fuel consumption, range was: at , at and at . However, in practice fuel consumption was much higher, and at the actual range was about with a five per cent reserve allowance.
Designed within the tight 35,000 ton limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated increases over the design displacement, seriously reducing freeboard and affecting seaworthiness. This was most acute at the already low bow. With too little buoyancy forward the bows were easily buried even in moderate seas, with spray washing up over both forward turrets. Heavy seas could flood &#x27;A&#x27; turret, drenching both men and machinery within.

=== Propulsion ===
&quot;King George V&quot; was equipped with eight Admiralty boilers. This configuration was a little more conventional than the preceding , with boiler rooms placed side by side and with each pair associated with a turbine room astern of them. The total heating surface of the boiler plants in &quot;King George V&quot; was . The 416-ton boiler installation produced more than , giving a top speed of 28 knots. The eight boilers were more economic in space and fuel than the twenty-four boilers in the battlecruiser . Fewer, but larger, boilers lowered the weight per unit of heat delivered, as did increased boiler efficiency and consumption of fuel per unit area of heating surface. This made &quot;King George V&quot; the fastest battleship in the British fleet but slower than the German, French or the new Italian capital ships, or the battlecruisers HMS &quot;Hood&quot;, and .

&quot;King George V&quot; had four sets of Parsons geared turbines. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.

=== Armament ===

==== Main battery ====

The tight limitations of the &quot;Washington Naval Treaty&quot; raised many challenges and required difficult compromises if they were to be met. To avoid the class being outgunned by the new ships of foreign navies, especially as by the mid-1930s the Treaty had been renounced by Japan and Italy, Churchill wrote to the First Lord of the Admiralty in 1936, voicing strong objections to the proposed armament of ten 14-inch guns. His proposal was for nine 16-inch guns.

When completed &quot;King George V&quot; mounted ten guns. They were mounted in one Mark II twin turret forward and two Mark III quadruple turrets, one forward and one aft. They could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees. Training arcs were: &quot;A&quot; turret, 286 degrees; &quot;B&quot; turret, 270 degrees and &quot;Y&quot; turret, 270 degrees. Training and elevating was achieved through a hydraulic drive, with rates of two and eight degrees per second, respectively. A full gun broadside weighed 15,950 pounds; a salvo could be fired every 30 seconds. The quadruple turrets weighed 1,582 tons, the twin turret 915 tons.

The turrets were designed by the Vickers Armstrong&#x27;s Elswick Works, but sets of each type of equipment were manufactured by Vickers Armstrongs in Barrow. A considerable amount of design effort was expended to make the turrets as flashtight as possible. This complicated the mechanical design of the turrets, particularly the quadruple mountings. Due to insufficient clearances and slightly distorted link mechanisms, failures in the intricate safety interlocks in the loading sequence for antiflash precautions caused jams during drills and practice firing. During the summer of 1941 the &quot;King George V&quot;-class battleships had their main armament turrets and turret linkages modified to correct the operational faults revealed during &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s final operation. HMS &quot;King George V&quot; used an Admiralty Fire Control Table Mark IX to control her main armament.

==== Secondary battery ====

The secondary armament consisted of sixteen guns in eight twin mounts, weighing 81 tons each. They were grouped at the four corners of the citadel, with a twin mount on the main deck and another superimposed above it nearer amidships. This disposition gave better arcs of fire, freedom from blast, more separation of the magazines and a better arrangement of the ammunition supply. The cupolas for these mounts revolved on either the upper or superstructure deck; between deck mountings travelled on roller paths on the armoured deck. This permitted a flat-trajectory or high-angle fire. Loading was semi-automatic, normal rate of fire was ten to twelve rounds per minute. The maximum range of the Mk I guns was at a 45-degree elevation, the anti-aircraft ceiling was . The guns could be elevated to 70 degrees and depressed to 5 degrees. However, the guns could only practically fire seven to eight rounds per minute, due to the heavy weight of the shell and the fact that the 5.25-inch round was semi-fixed, requiring the crew to separately load the cartridge and shell into the breech. &quot;King George V&quot; introduced the High Angle Control System Mark IVGB anti-aircraft fire control system to the Royal Navy, which, along with the Mk IV Pom-Pom Director, pioneered the use of the Gyro Rate Unit.

==== Anti-aircraft battery ====
The &quot;King George V&quot; design had four 0.5-inch quadruple machine gun mounts, but in 1939 these were replaced by two Mark VI pom-pom mounts. In 1940, to combat air attack, four Unrotated Projectile mountings were fitted, on &quot;B&quot; turret, two on &quot;Y&quot; turret, one replaced a pom-pom mount added in 1939 at the stern. The pom-poms mounted in the &quot;King George V&quot; were designed and produced by Vickers Armstrongs as a result of a post-First World War requirement for a multiple mounting which was effective against close-range bombers or torpedo planes. The first model, tested in 1927, was superior to anything developed in other countries at the time and in 1938 the Mark VI* had a muzzle velocity of 2,400 feet per second, a 1.594-inch bore and a barrel length of 40 calibres. They fired a shell at a rate of 96–98 rounds per minute for controlled fire and 115 rounds per minute for automatic fire. The range of the Mark VI* was , at a muzzle velocity of 2,300 feet per second. The Mark VI octuple mount weighed 16 tons. The Mark VII quadruple mount weighed 10.8 tons if power operated; it could be elevated to 80 degrees and depressed to 10 degrees at a rate of 25 degrees per second which was also the rate of train. The normal ammunition supply on board for the Mark VI was 1,800 rounds per barrel. &quot;King George V&quot; introduced the Mk IV Pom-pom director to the Royal Navy in 1940, becoming the first ship in the world to feature gyroscopic target tracking in tachymetric anti-aircraft directors.

== Operational history ==
The first of her class to be completed, &quot;King George V&quot; was commissioned at her shipyard and sailed for Rosyth in Scotland on 16 October 1940; there she took on board her ammunition and began her sea trials. By the end of the year she had joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow. She crossed the Atlantic early in 1941 to take Lord Halifax, the Ambassador to the United States, to Annapolis and covered the east-bound convoy BHX 104 on her return, arriving back at Scapa Flow on 6 February. Her next task was to provide distant cover for Operation Claymore, the commando raid on the Lofoten islands off the north-west coast of Norway. In March, she was assigned to escort the Atlantic convoy HX 115, sailing from Scapa Flow on 9 March and arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 15 March. &quot;King George V&quot; left Halifax the next day to search with HMS &quot;Rodney&quot; for the German battleships &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; who were attacking convoy ships south of Cape Race, Newfoundland as part of Operation Berlin. However fearing a gathering of British capital ships, the two German battleships broke off their attacks and returned to France. &quot;King George V&quot; joined Convoy HX 115 to provide escort on 20 March and returned to Scapa Flow at the end of March.

=== Action with &quot;Bismarck&quot; ===

When the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; along with the heavy cruiser broke out into the Atlantic Ocean, &quot;King George V&quot; sailed on 22 May 1941 with the aircraft carrier and eleven cruisers and destroyers in support of the cruiser patrols off Iceland. &quot;King George V&quot; was the flagship of Admiral Sir John Tovey, who commanded the force. &quot;King George V&quot; was still away on the morning of 24 May, when sister ship and &quot;Hood&quot; engaged both &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;. &quot;Hood&quot; was sunk and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was damaged when taking fire from both &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; and forced to retire. &quot;Bismarck&quot;, although damaged, continued south with &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;.

The British re-located &quot;Bismarck&quot; at 10:30 on 26 May, when a Catalina flying boat of RAF Coastal Command sighted her, heading for the French port of Brest. &quot;Rodney&quot; and &quot;King George V&quot; were still about away. The aircraft carrier was ordered to launch an air attack, and at 22:25 her torpedo bombers, a flight of Fairey Swordfishes damaged &quot;Bismarck&quot;, slowing her down and jamming her rudder, forcing her to turn back out into the Atlantic, away from the safety of port. At 15:00 &quot;Rodney&quot; joined &quot;King George V&quot; and they maintained 22 knots – which was nearly maximum speed for &quot;Rodney&quot;. &quot;King George V&quot; had only 32 per cent of her fuel left while &quot;Rodney&quot; had only enough fuel to continue the chase at high speed until 8:00 the following day.

Admiral Tovey signalled his battle plan to &quot;Rodney&quot; just before sunrise on 27 May; she was free to manœuvre independently as long as she conformed generally to the movements of &quot;King George V&quot;. Both ships were to close the range to as quickly as possible, then turn for broadside fire.

At 08:15 the cruiser spotted &quot;Bismarck&quot; and turned away out of range. She soon sighted the other British ships off her starboard quarter, and informed them that &quot;Bismarck&quot; was roughly to the southwest. By 08:43 &quot;King George V&quot; had &quot;Bismarck&quot; in sight, at . Four minutes later &quot;Rodney&quot; opened fire. &quot;King George V&quot; followed suit in less than a minute. &quot;Bismarck&quot; answered almost immediately, straddling &quot;Rodney&quot; on her second salvo. By 08:59 &quot;King George V&quot; had closed to and all her 14-inch guns were firing; &quot;Rodney&quot; was firing 16-inch salvoes. &quot;Bismarck&quot; concentrated all her remaining guns on &quot;King George V&quot;, but only an occasional shell came close. At 09:14 &quot;King George V&quot;, at , had opened fire with her 5.25-inch guns, and &quot;Rodney&quot; had moved to .

At 09:27 a shell hitting &quot;Bismarck&quot; penetrated the hydraulic machinery in turret &#x27;Anton&#x27; and disabled it, causing the guns to run down to maximum depression. Her topsides were wrecked, and a large fire burned amidships. After firing steadily for over 30 minutes, without any problems, &quot;King George V&quot;, by 09:27, began having trouble with her main battery, and from that point onward every gun missed at least one salvo due to failures in the safety interlocks for antiflash protection and from ammunition feed jams. At 10:21, with &quot;Bismarck&quot; silenced and obviously sinking, Admiral Tovey detailed the cruiser to finish her off with torpedoes. &quot;King George V&quot; fired 339 14 in (356 mm) and over 700 5.25 in (133 mm) shells during the action. As both &quot;Rodney&quot; and &quot;King George V&quot; were low on fuel they returned to port at , escorted by eleven destroyers to guard against German air or submarine attack. The next day, after the escort was reduced to three destroyers, four German aircraft did attack but scored no hits. Both &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Rodney&quot; returned to port safely, but the destroyer , sent ahead to refuel, was bombed and sunk.

=== Collision damage ===

After repairs and adjustments to her guns, &quot;King George V&quot; attacked German shipping in the Glom Fjord, Norway, in October 1941. She then covered convoys to Russia. On 1 May 1942 she was operating with as an escort to Convoy PQ 15, and collided with the destroyer , which had manoeuvred to avoid a mine and crossed her bow in dense fog. &quot;Punjabi&quot; was cut in two and sank; &quot;King George V&quot; had of her bow badly damaged. &quot;King George V&quot; entered the Gladstone Dock in Liverpool on 9 May for repairs by Cammell Laird, and returned to Scapa Flow on 1 July 1942. The battleship did not leave Scapa Flow until 18 December when she finally resumed convoy escort duty, providing distant cover for the Arctic convoy JW 51A.

=== Mediterranean operations ===
In May 1943, &quot;King George V&quot; was moved to Gibraltar in preparation for Operation Husky. &quot;King George V&quot; and her sister ship were allocated to the reserve covering group when the operation got under way on 1 July. The two ships bombarded Trapani in Sicily on 12 July and also helped defend against an air raid whilst in Algiers prior to departing for Operation Avalanche, (the Allied invasion of Italy). The two ships also bombarded the islands of Levanzo and Favignana, after which they were in the reserve group for the Salerno landings (Operation Avalanche) which began on 9 September. &quot;King George V&quot; escorted part of the Italian Fleet, including the battleships and , to Malta after the armistice and with &quot;Howe&quot; provided cover for the 1st Airborne Division who were transported to Taranto in support of Operation Slapstick from 9 to 11 September by the cruiser and the fast minelayer . The battleship then escorted a naval force which occupied the Italian naval base at Taranto. She later escorted surrendered Italian ships from Malta to Alexandria. After bombarding German positions during the Salerno landings, &quot;King George V&quot; returned to the United Kingdom.

=== Pacific operations ===

&quot;King George V&quot; was in Liverpool for an overhaul from March to June, 1944; it included the installation of additional radar gear, more anti-aircraft guns, improved accommodation, and ventilation. On 28 October 1944 &quot;King George V&quot; sailed from Scapa Flow under the command of Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser to join other Royal Navy units assembling at Trincomalee in Ceylon. A stop at Alexandria en route enabled her to divert to Milos in the Aegean Sea to bombard German positions. On 1 December she resumed her eastward journey, arriving in Trincomalee on 15 December. &quot;King George V&quot; got under way again on 16 January 1945. The flotilla, known as TF 63, comprised &quot;King George V&quot;, the aircraft carriers , , and &quot;Victorious&quot;, four cruisers and ten destroyers. The first stage of the voyage was covering the 11,000 nautical miles to Sydney; en route the force attacked oil refineries on Sumatra in Operation Meridian. They also practised replenishment-at-sea and beat off a Japanese air attack, with &quot;King George V&quot;″s anti-aircraft crews shooting down one Mitsubishi Ki-21.

Joined by &quot;Howe&quot; and re-designated Task Force 57, the British Pacific Fleet was again involved in operations in late March 1945, when it launched attacks on the Sakishimo-Gunto airfields, a task it repeated in early May. On 4 May 1945 &quot;King George V&quot; led battleships and cruisers in a forty-five-minute bombardment of Japanese air facilities in the Ryukyu Islands. As the Allies approached the Japanese homeland, &quot;King George V&quot; was dispatched in mid-July to join the US battleships in a bombardment of industrial installations at Hitachi. &quot;King George V&quot; fired 267 rounds from her 14-inch guns during this operation. The task force then moved on to Hamamatsu in southern Honshu, where it carried out a further bombardment of aviation factories. During the Okinawa campaign, the battleship supported four fast carriers of the British Pacific Fleet. Her last offensive action was a night bombardment of Hamamatsu on 29 and 30 July 1945. With the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender that followed, &quot;King George V&quot; moved with other units of the British Pacific Fleet into Tokyo Bay to be present at the surrender ceremonies.

=== Post-war activity ===
In January 1946 she conveyed the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester on an official visit to Australia, returning to Portsmouth in March. She was flagship of the Home Fleet until December 1946, after becoming a training vessel.

&quot;King George V&quot;″s active naval career was terminated by the Royal Navy in June 1950, when she and her surviving sister-ships went into reserve and were mothballed. &quot;King George V&quot; was the first large warship to be preserved in this fashion. This involved sealing the armament, machinery and boilers against damp and installing dehumidifiers throughout. In December 1955, she was downgraded to extended reserve and in 1957 the decision was taken to scrap the four ships. The following year &quot;King George V&quot; was moved from her berth in Gareloch to the ship breaking firm of Arnott Young and Co. in Dalmuir to undergo dismantling.

== Refits ==
During her career, &quot;King George V&quot; was refitted on several occasions in order to update her equipment. The following are the dates and details of the refits undertaken:

<text>HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was a of the Royal Navy that was built at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. Despite being sunk less than a year after she was commissioned, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; had an extensive battle history, first seeing action in August 1940 while still being outfitted in her drydock, when she was attacked and damaged by German aircraft. In her brief career, she was involved in several key actions of the Second World War, including the May 1941 Battle of the Denmark Strait where she scored three hits on the , forcing &quot;Bismarck&quot; to abandon her raiding mission and head to port for repairs. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; later escorted one of the Malta convoys in the Mediterranean, during which she was attacked by Italian aircraft. In her final action, she attempted to intercept Japanese troop convoys off the coast of Malaya as part of Force Z when she was sunk by Japanese aircraft on 10 December 1941, two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

She was sunk alongside her consort, the battlecruiser , in an attack by 85 Mitsubishi G3M and G4M bombers of the Japanese navy air service. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; became the first capital ships to be sunk solely by air power on the open sea, a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was subsequently to play in naval warfare. The wreck of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; lies upside down in of water, near Kuantan, in the South China Sea.

== Construction ==
In the aftermath of the First World War, the Washington Naval Treaty was drawn up in 1922 in an effort to stop an arms race developing between Britain, Japan, France, Italy and the United States. This treaty limited the number of ships each nation was allowed to build and capped the tonnage of all capital ships at 35,000 tons. These restrictions were extended in 1930 through the Treaty of London, however, by the mid-1930s Japan and Italy had withdrawn from both of these treaties, and the British became concerned about a lack of modern battleships within their navy. As a result, the Admiralty ordered the construction of a new battleship class: the &quot;King George V&quot; class. Due to the provisions of both the Washington Naval Treaty and the Treaty of London, both of which were still in effect when the &quot;King George V&quot;s were being designed, the main armament of the class was limited to the guns prescribed under these instruments. They were the only battleships built at that time to adhere to the treaty, and even though it soon became apparent to the British that the other signatories to the treaty were ignoring its requirements, it was too late to change the design of the class before they were laid down in 1937.

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was originally to be named &quot;King Edward VIII&quot; but upon the abdication of Edward VIII the ship was renamed at Cammell Laird&#x27;s shipyard in Birkenhead on 1 January 1937, before being laid down. She was launched on 3 May 1939. She was still fitting out when war was declared in September, causing her construction schedule, and that of her sister, , to be accelerated. Nevertheless, the late delivery of gun mountings caused delays in her outfitting.

In early August 1940, while she was still being outfitted and was in a semi-complete state, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was attacked by German aircraft. One bomb fell between the ship and a wet basin wall, narrowly missing a 100-ton dockside crane, and exploded underwater below the bilge keel, about six feet from the ship&#x27;s port side in the vicinity of the aft group of 5.25-inch guns. The shell plating buckled over a distance of , rivets were sprung and there was considerable flooding in the port outboard compartments in the area of damage, causing a ten-degree list to port. The flooding was severe, because final compartment air tests had not yet been made and the ship did not have her pumping system in operation.

The water was pumped out through the joint efforts of a local fire company and the shipyard, and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was later dry-docked for permanent repairs. This damage and the problem with the delivery of her main guns and turrets delayed her completion. As the war progressed there was an urgent need for capital ships, and so her completion was advanced by postponing compartment air tests, ventilation tests and thorough testing of her bilge, ballast and fuel-oil systems.

== Description ==
&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; displaced as built and fully loaded. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Her designed metacentric height was at normal load and at deep load.

She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving four propeller shafts. Steam was provided by eight Admiralty boilers which normally delivered , but could deliver with forced draft,
for a top speed of . The ship carried of fuel oil, of diesel oil, of reserve feed water and of freshwater. During full-power trials on 31 March 1941, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; at 42,100 tons displacement achieved 28 knots with 111,600 shp at 228 rpm and a specific fuel consumption of 0.73 lb per shp. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; had a range of at .

=== Armament ===

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; mounted 10 BL 14-inch (356 mm) Mk VII guns, mounted in one Mark II twin turret forward and two Mark III quadruple turrets, one forward and one aft. The guns could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees. Training arcs were: turret &quot;A&quot;, 286 degrees; turret &quot;B&quot;, 270 degrees; turret &quot;Y&quot;, 270 degrees. Training and elevating was done by hydraulic drives, with rates of two and eight degrees per second, respectively. A full gun broadside weighed , and a salvo could be fired every 40 seconds. The secondary armament consisted of 16 QF 5.25-inch (133 mm) Mk I guns mounted in eight twin mounts, weighing 81 tons each. The maximum range of the Mk I guns was at a 45-degree elevation, the anti-aircraft ceiling was . The guns could be elevated to 70 degrees and depressed to 5 degrees. The normal rate of fire was ten to twelve rounds per minute, but in practice, the guns could only fire seven to eight rounds per minute. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; also carried 32 QF 2 pdr (1.575-inch, 40.0 mm) Mk.VIII &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft guns and 80 UP projectors, short-range rocket-firing anti-aircraft weapons used in the early days of the Second World War by the Royal Navy.

== Operational service ==

=== Action with &quot;Bismarck&quot; ===
On 22 May 1941, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, the battlecruiser and six destroyers were ordered to take station south of Iceland and intercept the if she attempted to break out into the Atlantic. Captain John Leach knew that main-battery breakdowns were likely to occur, since Vickers-Armstrongs technicians had already corrected some that took place during training exercises in Scapa Flow. These technicians were personally requested by the captain to remain aboard. They did so and played an important role in the resulting action.

The next day &quot;Bismarck&quot;, in company with the heavy cruiser , was reported heading south-westward in the Denmark Strait. At 20:00 Vice-Admiral Lancelot Holland, in his flagship &quot;Hood&quot;, ordered the force to steam at , which it did most of the night. His battle plan called for &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Hood&quot; to concentrate on &quot;Bismarck&quot;, while the cruisers and would handle &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;. However the two cruisers were not informed of this plan because of strict radio silence. At 02:00, on 24 May, the destroyers were sent as a screen to search for the German ships to the north, and at 02:47 &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; increased speed to and changed course slightly to obtain a better target angle on the German ships. The weather improved, with visibility, and crews were at action stations by 05:10.

At 05:37 an enemy contact report was made, and course was changed to starboard to close range. Neither ship was in good fighting trim. &quot;Hood&quot;, designed twenty-five years earlier, lacked adequate decking armour and would have to close the range quickly, as she would become progressively less vulnerable to plunging shellfire at shorter ranges. She had completed an overhaul in March and her crew had not been adequately retrained. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, with thicker armour, was less vulnerable to 15-inch shells at ranges greater than , but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course change at 05:49, but they had made their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow) and their aft turrets could not fire. &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, with &quot;Bismarck&quot; , had &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Hood&quot; slightly forward of the beam, and both ships could deliver full broadsides.

At 05:53, despite seas breaking over the bows, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; opened fire on &quot;Bismarck&quot; at .&lt;ref name=&quot;ADM 234/509&quot;&gt;ADM 234/509&lt;/ref&gt; There was some confusion among the British as to which ship was &quot;Bismarck&quot; and thirty seconds earlier &quot;Hood&quot; had mistakenly opened fire on &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; as the German ships had similar profiles. &quot;Hood&quot;″s first salvo straddled the enemy ship, but &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, in less than three minutes, scored 8-inch-shell hits on &quot;Hood&quot;. The first shots by &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; – two three-gun salvoes at ten-second intervals – were 1,000 yards over. The turret rangefinders on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; could not be used because of spray over the bow and fire was instead directed from the rangefinders in the control tower.

The sixth, ninth and thirteenth salvos were straddles and two hits were made on &quot;Bismarck&quot;. One shell holed her bow and caused &quot;Bismarck&quot; to lose 1,000 tons of fuel oil, mostly to salt-water contamination. The other fell short, and entered &quot;Bismarck&quot; below her side armour belt, the shell exploded and flooded the auxiliary boiler machinery room and forced the shutdown of two boilers due to a slow leak in the boiler room immediately aft. The loss of fuel and boiler power were decisive factors in the &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s decision to return to port. In &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, &quot;A1&quot; gun ceased fire after the first salvo due to a defect. Sporadic breakdowns occurred until the decision to turn away was made, and during the turn &quot;Y&quot; turret jammed.

Both German ships initially concentrated their fire on &quot;Hood&quot; and destroyed her with salvoes of 8- and 15-inch shells. An 8-inch shell hit the boat deck and struck a ready service locker for ammunition, and a fire blazed high above the first superstructure deck. At 05:58 at a range of , the force commander ordered a turn of 20 degrees to port to open the range and bring the full battery of the British ships to bear on &quot;Bismarck&quot;. As the turn began, &quot;Bismarck&quot; straddled &quot;Hood&quot; with her third and fourth four-gun salvoes and at 06:01 the fifth salvo hit her, causing a large explosion. Flames shot up near &quot;Hood&quot;″s masts, then an orange-coloured fireball and an enormous smoke cloud obliterated the ship. On &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, it seemed that &quot;Hood&quot; collapsed amidships, and the bow and stern could be seen rising as she rapidly settled. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; made a sharp starboard turn to avoid hitting the debris and in doing so further closed the range between her and the German ships. In the four-minute action, &quot;Hood&quot;, the largest battlecruiser in the world, had been sunk. 1,419 officers and men were killed. Only three men survived.
&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; fired unopposed until she began a port turn at 05:57, when &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; took her under fire. After &quot;Hood&quot; exploded at 06:01, the Germans opened intense and accurate fire on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, with 15-inch, 8-inch and 5.9-inch guns. A heavy hit was sustained below the waterline as &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; manoeuvred past the wreckage of &quot;Hood&quot;. At 06:02, a 15-inch shell struck the starboard side of the compass platform and killed the majority of the personnel there. The navigating officer was wounded, but Captain Leach was unhurt. Casualties were caused by the fragments from the shell&#x27;s ballistic cap and the material it dislodged in its diagonal path through the compass platform. A 15-inch diving shell penetrated the ship&#x27;s side below the armour belt amidships, failed to explode and came to rest in the wing compartments on the starboard side of the after boiler rooms. The shell was discovered and defused when the ship was docked at Rosyth.

At 06:05 Captain Leach decided to disengage and laid down a heavy smokescreen to cover &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″s escape. Leach then radioed &quot;Norfolk&quot; that &quot;Hood&quot; had been sunk and went to join &quot;Suffolk&quot; astern of &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The British ships continued to chase &quot;Bismarck&quot; until 18:16 when &quot;Suffolk&quot; sighted the German battleship at . &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; then opened fire on &quot;Bismarck&quot; at an extreme range of . All 12 salvos missed. At 01:00 on 25 May &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; again regained contact and opened fire at a radar range of , after observers believed that she had scored a hit on &quot;Bismarck&quot;, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″s &quot;A&quot; turret temporarily jammed, leaving her with only six operational guns. After losing sight of &quot;Bismarck&quot; owing to poor visibility, and after searching for 12 hours, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; headed for Iceland. Thirteen of her crew had been killed, and nine wounded.

On Friday 6 June, while in dry dock, a hole was found just above the starboard bilge keel. After the inner space had been pumped out, an unexploded shell from &quot;Bismarck&quot; was found nose forward, with its fuse, but without a ballistic cap. The shell was removed by the Bomb Disposal Officer from HMS &quot;Cochrane&quot;

=== Atlantic Charter meeting ===
After repairs at Rosyth, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; took Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the Atlantic for the secret Atlantic Conference (Codename: &quot;Riviera&quot;) with US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. On 5 August Roosevelt boarded the cruiser from the presidential yacht . &quot;Augusta&quot; proceeded from Massachusetts to Placentia Bay and Argentia in Newfoundland with the cruiser and five destroyers, arriving on 7 August while &quot;Potomac&quot; played a decoy role by continuing to cruise New England waters as if the president were still on board. On 9 August, Churchill arrived in the bay aboard &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, escorted by the destroyers HMS &quot;Ripley&quot;, and . At Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, Roosevelt transferred to the destroyer to meet Churchill on board &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. The conference continued from 10 to 12 August aboard &quot;Augusta&quot; and, at the end of the conference, the Atlantic Charter was proclaimed. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; arrived back at Scapa Flow on 18 August.

=== Mediterranean duty ===
In September 1941, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was assigned to Force H, in the Mediterranean. On 24 September &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; formed part of Group II, led by Vice-Admiral Alban Curteis and consisting of the battleships &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and , the cruisers , , and , and twelve destroyers. The force provided an escort for Operation Halberd, a supply convoy from Gibraltar to Malta. On 27 September the convoy was attacked by Italian aircraft, with &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; shooting down several with her guns. Later that day there were reports that units of the Italian Fleet were approaching. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, the battleship &quot;Rodney&quot; and the aircraft carrier were despatched to intercept, but the search proved fruitless. The convoy arrived in Malta without further incident, and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; returned to Gibraltar, before sailing on to Scapa Flow, arriving there on 6 October.

=== Far East ===
Churchill had proposed sending one of the new &quot;King George V&quot; battleships to Asia as a deterrent to Japanese aggression, though Admiral of the Home Fleet Sir John Tovey was opposed believing that &quot;King George Vs&quot; were not suited to operating in tropical climates. On 25 October &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and a destroyer escort left home waters bound for Singapore, there to rendezvous with the battlecruiser and the aircraft carrier . &quot;Indomitable&quot; however ran aground off Jamaica a few days later and was unable to proceed. Calling at Freetown and Cape Town South Africa to refuel and generate publicity, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; also stopped in Mauritius and the Maldive Islands. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; reached Colombo, Ceylon, on 28 November, joining &quot;Repulse&quot; the next day. On 2 December the fleet docked in Singapore. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; then became the flagship of Force Z, under the command of Admiral Sir Tom Phillips.

Japanese troop-convoys were first sighted on 6 December. Two days later, Japanese aircraft raided Singapore; although the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″s anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, they scored no hits and had no effect on the Japanese aircraft. A signal was received from the Admiralty in London ordering the British squadron to commence hostilities, and that evening, confident that a protective air umbrella would be provided by the RAF presence in the region, Admiral Phillips set sail. Force Z at this time comprised the battleship &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, the battlecruiser &quot;Repulse&quot;, and the destroyers , , and .

The object of the sortie was to attack Japanese transports at Kota Bharu, but in the afternoon of 9 December the Japanese submarine &quot;I-65&quot; spotted the British ships, and in the evening they were detected by Japanese aerial reconnaissance. By this time it had been made clear that no RAF fighter support would be forthcoming. At midnight a signal was received that Japanese forces were landing at Kuantan in Malaya. Force Z was diverted to investigate. At 02:11 on 10 December the force was again sighted by a Japanese submarine and at 08:00 arrived off Kuantan, only to discover that the reported landings were a diversion.

At 11:00 that morning the first Japanese air attack began. Eight Type 96 &quot;Nell&quot; bombers dropped their bombs close to &quot;Repulse&quot;, one passing through the hangar roof and exploding on the 1-inch plating of the main deck below. The second attack force, comprising seventeen &quot;Nells&quot; armed with torpedoes, arrived at 11:30, divided into two attack formations. Despite reports to the contrary, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was struck by only one torpedo. Meanwhile, &quot;Repulse&quot; avoided the seven torpedoes aimed at her, as well as bombs dropped by six other &quot;Nells&quot; a few minutes later.

The torpedo struck &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; on the port side aft, abaft &quot;Y&quot; Turret, wrecking the outer propeller shaft on that side and destroying bulkheads to one degree or another along the shaft all the way to B Engine Room. This caused rapid uncontrollable flooding and put the entire electrical system in the after part of the ship out of action. Lacking effective damage control, she soon took on a heavy list.

A third torpedo attack developed against &quot;Repulse&quot; and once again she avoided taking any hits.

A fourth attack, conducted by torpedo-carrying Type 1 &quot;Bettys&quot;, developed. This one scored hits on &quot;Repulse&quot; and she sank at 12:33. Six aircraft from this wave also attacked &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, hitting her with three torpedoes, causing further damage and flooding. Finally, a bomb hit &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;&#x27;s catapult deck, penetrated to the main deck, where it exploded, causing many casualties in the makeshift aid centre in the Cinema Flat. Several other bombs from this attack scored very near misses, indenting the hull, popping rivets and causing hull plates to split along the seams and intensifying the flooding. At 13:15 the order to abandon ship was given, and at 13:20 &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; capsized to port, floated for a few brief moments upside down, and sank stern first; Admiral Phillips and Captain Leach were among the 327 fatalities.

=== Aftermath ===

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; were the first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea (albeit by land-based rather than carrier-based aircraft), a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was to play in naval warfare thereafter. It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; were her surface-scanning radars being inoperable in the humid tropic climate, depriving Force Z of one of its most potent early-warning devices, and the critical early damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″s demise was the loss of her dynamos, depriving &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; of many of her electric pumps. Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness, and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.
The sinking was the subject of an inquiry chaired by Mr. Justice Bucknill, but the true causes of the ship&#x27;s loss were only established when divers examined the wreck after the war. The Director of Naval Construction&#x27;s report on the sinking claimed that the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns could have inflicted heavy casualties before torpedoes were dropped, if not preventing the successful conclusion of attack had crews been more adequately trained in their operation.

=== The wreck ===

The wreck lies upside down in of water at . 

A Royal Navy White Ensign attached to a line on a buoy tied to a propeller shaft is periodically renewed. The wreck site was designated a &#x27;Protected Place&#x27; in 2001 under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, just prior to the 60th anniversary of her sinking. The ship&#x27;s bell was manually raised in 2002 by British technical divers with the permission of the Ministry of Defence and blessing of the Force Z Survivors Association. It was restored, then presented for display by First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Alan West, to the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool. The bell has been since moved to the National Museum of the Royal Navy at the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard for display in the Hear My Story Galleries.

In May 2007, Expedition &#x27;Job 74&#x27;, a dedicated survey of the exterior hull of both &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot;, was conducted. The expedition&#x27;s findings sparked considerable interest among naval architects and marine engineers around the world; as they detailed the nature of the damage to &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and the exact location and number of torpedo strike holes. Consequently, the findings contained in the initial expedition report and later supplementary reports were analysed by the SNAME (Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers) Marine Forensics Committee and a resultant paper was drawn up entitled &quot;Death of a Battleship: A Re-analysis of the Tragic Loss of HMS Prince of Wales&quot;, and was subsequently presented at a meeting of RINA (Royal Institution of Naval Architects) and IMarEST (Institute of Marine Engineering, Science &amp; Technology) members in London in 2009 by Mr William Garzke. This report was also presented to the IMarEST, this time in New York, in 2011. However, in 2012 the original paper was updated and expanded (and renamed &quot;Death of a Battleship: The Loss of HMS Prince of Wales. A Marine Forensics Analysis of the Sinking&quot;) in light of a subsequent diver being able to penetrate deep into the port outer propeller shaft tunnel with a high-definition camera, taking photos along the entire length of the propeller shaft all the way to the aft bulkhead of &#x27;B&#x27; Engine Room.

In October 2014, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that both &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; were being &quot;extensively damaged&quot; with explosives by scrap metal dealers. It is a tradition for passing Royal Navy ships to perform a remembrance service over the site of the wrecks. In May 2023, it was reported that a Chinese ship, &quot;Chuan Hong 68&quot;, illegally scavenged the wreck for its low-background steel. In July 2024, this same vessel, &quot;Chuan Hong 68&quot;, suspected of not only looting the wrecks of Force Z but other World War II wrecks in Asian waters, was back &#x27;working&#x27; in the region and was subsequently detained by Malaysia authorities for &#x27;paperwork violations&#x27;.

===Replica bell for successor===

In spring 2019, Cammell Laird was commissioned to make a replica of the ship&#x27;s bell for the ship&#x27;s successor, , the second . The original at the National Museum of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Portsmouth Historic Dockyard location was surveyed as part of the process. Cammell Laird were able to contact Utley Offshore in St Helens, the foundry that made the original bell and that of , which still had the pattern based on the 1908 Admiralty design. Compared to the bronze or bell metal that is used in most modern ship bells, nickel silver was used for authenticity. The engraving was done by Shawcross in Birkenhead, while Cammell Laird shipwrights constructed the hardwood base. Cammell Laird COO Tony Graham presented the finished replica to commanding officer Captain Darren Houston during the ship&#x27;s week-long visit to Liverpool in March 2020.

== Refits ==
During her career, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was refitted on several occasions, to bring her equipment up to date. The following are the dates and details of the refits undertaken.

<doc id="485618" wikidata="Q904353" url="?curid=485618" title="HMS Duke of York (17)">
<text>HMS &quot;Duke of York&quot; was a battleship of the Royal Navy. Laid down in May 1937, the ship was constructed by John Brown and Company at Clydebank, and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 4 November 1941, subsequently seeing combat service during the Second World War. In mid-December 1941, &quot;Duke of York&quot; transported Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the United States to meet President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Between March and September 1942 &quot;Duke of York&quot; was involved with convoy escort duties, including as flagship of the Heavy Covering Force of Convoy PQ-17, but in October she was dispatched to Gibraltar where she became the flagship of Force H.

In October 1942, &quot;Duke of York&quot; was involved in the Allied invasion of North Africa, but saw little action as her role only required her to protect the accompanying aircraft carriers. After the invasion, &quot;Duke of York&quot; was involved in Operations Camera and Governor, which were diversionary operations designed to draw the Germans&#x27; attention away from Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. On 4 October, &quot;Duke of York&quot; operated with her sister ship in covering a force of Allied cruisers and destroyers and the American carrier , during Operation Leader, which raided German shipping off Norway. The attack sank four merchant ships and badly damaged a further seven.

On 26 December 1943 &quot;Duke of York&quot; was part of a task force which encountered the off the North Cape of Norway. During the engagement that followed, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; hit &quot;Duke of York&quot; twice with little effect, but was herself hit by several of &quot;Duke of York&quot;″s 14-inch shells, silencing one of her turrets and hitting a boiler room. After temporarily escaping from &quot;Duke of York&quot;″s heavy fire, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was struck several times by torpedoes, allowing &quot;Duke of York&quot; to again open fire, contributing to the eventual sinking of &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; after a running action lasting ten-and-a-half hours. In 1945, &quot;Duke of York&quot; was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet as its flagship, but arrived too late to see any action before Japan surrendered. After the war, &quot;Duke of York&quot; remained active until she was laid up in November 1951. She was eventually scrapped in 1957.

&quot;Duke of York&quot; had a ship&#x27;s cat named Whisky.

== Construction ==
In the aftermath of the First World War, the Washington Naval Treaty was drawn up in 1922 in an effort to stop an arms race developing between Britain, Japan, France, Italy and the United States. This treaty limited the number of ships each nation was allowed to build and capped the displacement of capital ships at . These restrictions were extended in 1930 through the London Naval Treaty, but by the mid-1930s Japan and Italy had withdrawn from both of these treaties and the British became concerned about the lack of modern battleships in the Royal Navy. The Admiralty therefore ordered the construction of a new battleship class: the . Due to the provisions of both the Washington Naval Treaty and the London Treaty, both of which were still in effect when the &quot;King George V&quot;s were being designed, the main armament of the class was limited to the guns. They were the only battleships built at that time to adhere to the treaty and even though it soon became apparent to the British that the other signatories to the treaty were ignoring its requirements, it was too late to change the design of the class before they were laid down in 1937.

&quot;Duke of York&quot; was the third ship in the &quot;King George V&quot; class, and was laid down at John Brown &amp; Company&#x27;s shipyard in Clydebank on 5 May 1937. The title of Duke of York was in abeyance at that time, having been that held by King George VI prior to his succession to the throne in December 1936. The battleship was launched on 28 February 1940 and completed on 4 November 1941, and joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow.

== Description ==

&quot;Duke of York&quot; displaced as built and fully loaded. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Her designed metacentric height was at normal load and at deep load.

She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving four propeller shafts. Steam was provided by eight Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers which normally delivered , but could deliver at emergency overload.
This gave &quot;Duke of York&quot; a top speed of . The ship carried of fuel oil, which was later increased to . She also carried of diesel oil, of reserve feed water and of freshwater. At full speed &quot;Duke of York&quot; had a range of at .

=== Armament ===

&quot;Duke of York&quot; mounted 10 BL Mk VII guns, which were mounted in one Mark II twin turret forward and two Mark III quadruple turrets, one forward and one aft. The guns could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees, while their training arcs varied. Turret &quot;A&quot; was able to traverse 286 degrees, while turrets &quot;B&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; could both move through 270 degrees. Hydraulic drives were used in the training and elevating process, achieving rates of two and eight degrees per second, respectively. A full gun broadside weighed , and a salvo could be fired every 40 seconds. The secondary armament consisted of 16 QF Mk I dual purpose guns which were mounted in eight twin turrets. The maximum range of the Mk I guns was at a 45-degree elevation, the anti-aircraft ceiling was . The guns could be elevated to 70 degrees and depressed to 5 degrees. The normal rate of fire was ten to twelve rounds per minute, but in practice the guns could fire only seven to eight rounds per minute. Along with her main and secondary batteries, &quot;Duke of York&quot; carried 48 QF 2 pdr () Mk.VIII &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft guns in six octuple, power-driven, mountings. These were supplemented by six Oerlikon light AA guns in single, hand-worked, mounts.

== Operational history ==
===Second World War ===
In mid-December 1941, &quot;Duke of York&quot; embarked Prime Minister Winston Churchill for a trip to the United States to confer with President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She arrived at Annapolis, Maryland, on 22 December 1941, made a shakedown cruise to Bermuda in January 1942, and departed for Scapa Flow on 17 January with Churchill returning home by air.

On 1 March 1942, she provided close escort for Convoy PQ 12 in company with the battlecruiser , the cruiser , and six destroyers. On 6 March, that force was reinforced with one of &quot;Duke of York&quot;″s sister-ships, , and the aircraft carrier , the heavy cruiser , and six destroyers as a result of Admiral John Tovey&#x27;s concerns that the battleship might attempt to intercept the convoy. On 6 March, the German battleship put to sea and was sighted by a British submarine around 19:40; no contact was made, however, except for an unsuccessful aerial torpedo attack by aircraft from &quot;Victorious&quot;.

Later that month, Convoy PQ 13 was constituted and &quot;Duke of York&quot; again formed part of the escort force. In early April, &quot;Duke of York&quot;, &quot;King George V&quot;, and the carrier &quot;Victorious&quot; formed the core of a support force that patrolled between Iceland and Norway to cover several convoys to the Soviet Union. In late April, when &quot;King George V&quot; accidentally rammed and sank the destroyer in dense fog, sustaining significant bow damage, &quot;Duke of York&quot; was sent to relieve her. She continued in these operations through May, when she was joined by the American battleship . In mid-September, &quot;Duke of York&quot; escorted Convoy QP 14.

In October 1942, &quot;Duke of York&quot; was sent to Gibraltar as the new flagship of Force H, and supported the Allied landings in North Africa the following month. During this time &quot;Duke of York&quot; came under air attack by Italian aircraft on several occasions, but the raids were relatively small scale and were swiftly dealt with by the &quot;umbrella&quot; provided by the aircraft from the accompanying carriers &quot;Victorious&quot;, and . After this action, &quot;Duke of York&quot; returned to Britain for a refit.

With her refit completed, &quot;Duke of York&quot; resumed her status as flagship from 14 May 1943 pending the departure of &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Howe&quot; for Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Operation Gearbox in June 1943 involved a sweep by &quot;Duke of York&quot; and , in company with the US battleships and , to provide distant cover for minor operations in Spitsbergen and the Kola Inlet, while the following month diversionary operations, code-named &quot;Camera&quot; and &quot;Governor of Norway,&quot; were carried out to draw the Germans&#x27; attention away from Operation Husky. On 4 October, &quot;Duke of York&quot; and &quot;Anson&quot; covered a force of Allied cruisers and destroyers and the American carrier under Operation Leader, which raided German shipping off Norway. The attack resulted in the sinking of four German merchant ships and damage to seven others, which forced many of them to be grounded.

==== Action against &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; ====
In 1943 the German battleship &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; moved to Norway, a position whence she could threaten the Arctic convoys to Russia. With &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and two armoured ships also in Norwegian fjords, it was necessary for the Royal Navy to provide heavy escorts for convoys between Britain and Russia. One of these was sighted by the Germans in early December 1943, and Allied intelligence concluded that the following Convoy JW 55B, would be attacked by the German surface ships. Two surface forces were assigned to provide distant cover to JW 55B, which had left Loch Ewe on 22 December. On 25 December 1943, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was reported at sea. The Force 1 cruisers , and , with four destroyers, made contact shortly after 09:00 on 26 December. A brief engagement occurred around 09:30, but &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; outdistanced her pursuers, and again outran them after a brief skirmish around noon.

Force 2, including &quot;Duke of York&quot;, the cruiser and four destroyers, was closing, and it was estimated that a night action with &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; would commence around 17:15. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; altered course, and contact was made at 16:32, at a distance of . Force 2 manoeuvred for broadside fire. &quot;Belfast&quot;, with Force 1, fired star shells at 16:47 to illuminate &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;. This failed, so &quot;Duke of York&quot; fired a star shell from one of her guns, taking &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; by surprise with her main battery trained fore and aft. By 16:50 &quot;Duke of York&quot; had closed to and opened fire with a full ten-gun broadside, scoring one hit. Although under heavy fire, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; straddled &quot;Duke of York&quot; a number of times and hit her twice. A shell passed through the main mast and its port leg without detonating but fragments from the hit destroyed the cable for the main search radar. A shell also pierced the port strut of the foremast without exploding. At 16:55 a shell silenced turrets Anton and Bruno, but &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; maintained speed so that by 18:24 the range had opened to , when &quot;Duke of York&quot; ceased fire after expending fifty-two broadsides. One shell from the final salvos hit and exploded in &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s number one boiler room, slowing the ship and allowing the pursuing destroyers to overtake her.
Force 2&#x27;s destroyers then attacked with torpedoes, firing 28 and scoring hits with three. This slowed &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, and at 19:01 &quot;Duke of York&quot; again opened fire, at a range of . She ceased fire at 19:30 to allow the cruisers to close on &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;. Ten 14-inch shells had hit the German battleship, causing fires and explosions, and silencing almost all of the secondary battery. By 19:16 all of the main turrets aboard &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; had ceased fire and her speed had been cut to . &quot;Duke of York&quot; ceased fire at 19:30. In the final stages of the battle the destroyers fired a total of 19 torpedoes at her, causing &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; to list badly to port, and at 19:45 she sank after a running action lasting ten-and-a-half hours from the first, taking with her over 1,700 men. Following her sinking, and the retreat of most of the other German heavy units from Norway, the need to maintain powerful forces in British home waters was diminished. Her ship&#x27;s cat &quot;Whisky&quot; was famously known for supposedly sleeping through the action.

==== Subsequent operations ====

On 29 March 1944, &quot;Duke of York&quot; and the bulk of the Home Fleet left Scapa Flow to provide a support force for Convoy JW 58. The ship operated in the Arctic and as cover for carriers conducting the Goodwood series of air strikes on &quot;Tirpitz&quot; in mid to late August. In September, when she was overhauled and partially modernized at Liverpool, radar equipment and additional anti-aircraft guns were added. She was then ordered to join the British Pacific Fleet and sailed in company with her sister-ship &quot;Anson&quot; on 25 April 1945. A problem with the ship&#x27;s electrical circuitry delayed her while she was at Malta and, as a result, she did not reach Sydney until 29 July, by which time it too late for her to take any meaningful part in hostilities against the Japanese.

Nevertheless, in early August, &quot;Duke of York&quot; was assigned to Task Force 37, along with four aircraft carriers and her sister-ship &quot;King George V&quot;. From 9 August, TF 37 and three American carrier task forces conducted a series of air raids on Japan, which continued until 15 August when a surrender came into effect. After the conclusion of hostilities, &quot;Duke of York&quot;, alongside her sister-ship, &quot;King George V&quot;, participated in the surrender ceremonies that took place in Tokyo Bay. The following month &quot;Duke of York&quot; sailed for Hong Kong, to join the fleet that assembled there to accept the surrender of the Japanese garrison. She was the flagship of the British Pacific Fleet when the Japanese surrendered, and remained so until June 1946, when she returned to Plymouth for an overhaul.

=== Post war ===

&quot;Duke of York&quot; was flagship of the Home Fleet following the end of the war and remained in active service until April 1949. She was laid up in November 1951, and on 18 May 1957, she was ordered scrapped. She was broken up by Shipbreaking Industries, Ltd., in Faslane. The ship&#x27;s bell was salvaged and given to the Duke of York School (since renamed the Lenana School) in Nairobi, Kenya.
== Refits ==
During her career, &quot;Duke of York&quot; was refitted on several occasions to bring her equipment up-to-date. The following are the dates and details of the refits undertaken.

<text>HMS &quot;Anson&quot; was a battleship of the Royal Navy, named after Admiral George Anson. She was built by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Shipyard on the River Tyne and launched on 24 February 1940, being completed on 22 June 1942. Her completion was delayed to allow the fitting of fire-control radar and additional anti-aircraft weapons. She was originally to have been named &quot;Jellicoe&quot;, but was renamed &quot;Anson&quot; in February 1940.

&quot;Anson&quot; saw service in the Second World War, escorting nine Russian convoys in the Arctic by December 1943. She took part in diversionary moves to draw attention away from Operation Husky in July 1943. In October the same year she took part in Operation Leader. In February 1944 she provided cover for Operation Tungsten, the successful air strike against the . Rear Admiral Cecil Harcourt accepted the surrender of Japanese forces occupying Hong Kong on board &quot;Anson&quot; in August 1945, and after the end of the war the vessel became the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet.

&quot;Anson&quot; arrived back in British waters on 29 July 1946, spending the next three years in active service with the post-war navy. She was finally placed in reserve and &quot;mothballed&quot; in 1949, spending eight years in this condition. On 17 December 1957 she was purchased for scrap by Shipbreaking Industries, Faslane.

== Construction ==
In the aftermath of the First World War, the Washington Naval Treaty was drawn up in 1922 in an effort to stop an arms race developing between Britain, Japan, France, Italy and the United States. This treaty limited the number of ships each nation was allowed to build and capped the displacement of all capital ships at 35,000 long tons. These restrictions were extended in 1930 through the London Naval Treaty, however, in 1935 Japan and Italy would not agree to the Second London Naval Treaty for further armament control.

Concerned by a lack of modern battleships within their navy, the Admiralty ordered the construction of a new battleship class: the &quot;King George V&quot; class. The calibre limitation clause introduced in the Second Treaty meant that the main armament of the &quot;King George V&quot; class was limited to and the unusual arrangement of the guns in the three turrets was an attempt to maximise firepower. Due to the pressing need for the ships, the British, unlike the US, could not delay to take advantage of an escalator clause that would allow 16-inch guns. The ships were the only ones to be built at the time to adhere to the treaty and even though it soon became apparent to the British that the other signatories to the treaty were ignoring its requirements, it was too late to change the design of the class before they were laid down in 1937.

The keel of the fourth ship of the class was laid at the Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Shipyard on the River Tyne on 20 July 1937. She was originally to have been named &quot;Jellicoe&quot;, after Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, the commander of the Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in 1916, but she was renamed &quot;Anson&quot; in February 1940. &quot;Anson&quot; was launched on 24 February 1940 and was completed on 22 June 1942. Completion was delayed largely because of the inclusion of fire-control radar, and additional anti-aircraft weapons.

== Description ==
&quot;Anson&quot; displaced on trials in 1942 and fully loaded in 1945. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Her designed metacentric height was at normal load and at deep load.

She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines driving four propeller shafts. Steam was provided by eight Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers which normally delivered , but could deliver at emergency overload.
This gave &quot;Anson&quot; a top speed of . The ship carried of fuel oil. At full speed &quot;Anson&quot; had a range of at while burning of fuel per hour.

=== Armament ===
&quot;Anson&quot;″s main armament was ten BL Mk VII guns. The 14-inch guns were mounted in three turrets; one Mark III quadruple turret forward and one aft, and one Mark II twin turret forward firing over the quadruple turret. The guns could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees. A full gun broadside weighed , and a salvo could be fired every 40 seconds. Her secondary armament consisted of 16 QF Mk I guns which were mounted in eight twin mounts. The maximum range of the Mk I guns was at a 45-degree elevation, the anti-aircraft ceiling was . The guns could be elevated to 70 degrees and depressed to 5 degrees. The normal rate of fire was ten to twelve rounds per minute, but in practice the guns could only fire seven to eight rounds per minute. Along with her main and secondary batteries &quot;Anson&quot; carried six 8-barrelled QF 2-pounder Mk. VIII (40 mm) &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft guns. These were supplemented by eighteen Oerlikon light AA guns.

== Operational history ==

After her commissioning in 1942, &quot;Anson&quot; was sent to the Arctic Sea with most of the Home Fleet as an escort ship for Russian convoys. On 12 September 1942 &quot;Anson&quot; was part of the distant covering force for Convoy QP 14, along with her sister ship , the light cruiser and the destroyers , , and . On 29 December &quot;Anson&quot; provided distant cover for Convoy JW 51B along with the cruiser and the destroyers , and . On 23 and 24 January 1943 &quot;Anson&quot; provided distant cover for Convoy JW 52 along with the cruiser and the destroyers , , , , &quot;Montrose&quot;, , and the Polish destroyer . On 29 January, Convoy RA 52 departed from the Kola inlet, with distant cover provided by &quot;Anson&quot;, the cruiser &quot;Sheffield&quot; and the destroyers &quot;Inglefield&quot;, , and the Polish destroyer &quot;Orkan&quot; from 30 January.

In June 1942, the pre-First World War battleship was disguised as &quot;Anson&quot; in the Mediterranean Sea, acting as a decoy during Operation Vigorous. In July 1943 &quot;Anson&quot; took part in the diversionary moves designed to draw attention away from the preparations for Operation Husky, and in October that year, with &quot;Duke of York&quot; and the US cruiser , provided cover for Operation Leader, in which the US aircraft carrier mounted air strikes against German shipping off Norway. In February 1944, in company with the and a force of cruisers and destroyers, &quot;Anson&quot; stood by in the same capacity while aircraft from the aircraft carrier carried out air strikes against German targets in Norway during Operation Bayleaf, and on 3 April she provided cover for Operation Tungsten, a successful air strike against the , during which she served as flagship for Vice Admiral Sir Henry Moore.

&quot;Anson&quot; was decommissioned for a refit in June 1944 and did not return to the fleet until March 1945, when she sailed with &quot;Duke of York&quot; to join the British Pacific Fleet. By the time she arrived in the theatre, hostilities were all but over. She left Sydney on 15 August for Hong Kong with &quot;Duke of York&quot;, and along with a task force of other ships from Britain and the Commonwealth, accepted the surrender of the Japanese forces occupying Hong Kong. She was also present in Tokyo Bay during the official Japanese surrender aboard .

It is reported that &quot;Anson&quot; never once fired her main armament in anger.

=== Post-war era===
Following the war &quot;Anson&quot; was the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet and helped to liberate Hong Kong. After a brief refit, &quot;Anson&quot; sailed from Sydney to Hobart in February 1946 to collect the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester (the Duke was then Governor-General of Australia) and return them to Sydney.

&quot;Anson&quot; arrived back in British waters on 29 July 1946 and after a short refit was returned to peacetime duties. In July 1949 &quot;Anson&quot; took part in Exercise Verity. November 1949, &quot;Anson&quot; was placed in reserve and in 1951 she was towed to Gare Loch. On 17 December 1957 she was purchased for scrap by Shipbreaking Industries, Faslane. A selection of her timbers would be reused to make souvenirs of different types.

== Refits ==
During her career, &quot;Anson&quot; was refitted on several occasions in order to update her equipment. The following are the dates and details of the refits undertaken:

<text>HMS &quot;Howe&quot; (pennant number 32) was the last of the five British &quot;King George V&quot;-class battleships of the Royal Navy. Built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, she was laid down on 1 June 1937 and launched 9 April 1940. She was originally to have been named &quot;Beatty&quot; but this was changed to &quot;Howe&quot;, after Admiral Richard Howe.

&quot;Howe&quot; was completed on 29 August 1942 after her building time was extended, as supplies were diverted to work of a higher priority such as the construction and repair of merchant ships and escort ships. Like her sister-ship , &quot;Howe&quot; spent most of her career in the Arctic providing cover for Russian convoys.

In 1943, &quot;Howe&quot; took part in Operation Husky and bombarded Trapani naval base and Favignana in support of the Allied landings. Along with , &quot;Howe&quot; escorted two surrendered Italian battleships to Alexandria. &quot;Howe&quot; was also sent to the Pacific and attached to the British Pacific Fleet (Task Force 113), where she provided naval bombardments for the Allied landings at Okinawa on 1 April 1945.

After the war, &quot;Howe&quot; spent four years as flagship of the Training Squadron at Portland, before she was placed in reserve in 1950. The battleship was marked for disposal in 1957, sold for scrap in 1958 and broken up by 1961.

==Construction==
In the aftermath of the First World War, the Washington Naval Treaty was drawn up in 1922 in an effort to stop an arms race from developing among Britain, Japan, France, Italy and the United States. This treaty limited the number of ships each nation was allowed to build and capped the tonnage of all capital ships at 35,000 tons. These restrictions were extended in 1930 through the Treaty of London, however, by the mid-1930s Japan and Italy had withdrawn from both of these treaties and the British became concerned about a lack of modern battleships within their navy. As a result, the Admiralty ordered the construction of a new battleship class: the &quot;King George V&quot; class. Due to the provisions of both the Washington Naval Treaty and the Treaty of London, both of which were still in effect when the &quot;King George V&quot;s were being designed, the main armament of the class was limited to the guns prescribed under these instruments. They were the only battleships built at that time to adhere to the treaty and even though it soon became apparent to the British that the other signatories to the treaty were ignoring its requirements, it was too late to change the design of the class before they were laid down in 1937.

The keel of &quot;Howe&quot;, the last ship of the &quot;King George V&quot; class, was laid on 1 June 1937 at the Fairfield Shipyard in Govan. She was originally to have been named HMS &quot;Beatty&quot;, after Admiral David Beatty, commander of the British battlecruiser squadron at the Battle of Jutland, but the name was changed to HMS &quot;Howe&quot;, after Admiral Richard Howe. &quot;Howe&quot; was launched on 9 April 1940 and completed on 20 August 1942. She carried improved anti-aircraft armament and radar equipment as a result of lessons already learned in World War II.

==Design==
&quot;Howe&quot; displaced as built and fully loaded. She had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Her designed metacentric height was at normal load and at deep load.

The ship was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving four propeller shafts. Steam was provided by eight Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers, which normally delivered but could produce at emergency overload. This gave &quot;Howe&quot; a top speed of . The ship carried of fuel oil. She also carried of diesel oil, of reserve feed water and of freshwater. At full speed &quot;Howe&quot; had a range of at .

=== Armament ===
&quot;Howe&quot; mounted 10 BL Mk VII guns. The 14-inch guns were mounted in one Mark II twin turret forward and two Mark III quadruple turrets, one forward and one aft. The guns could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees. Training arcs were: turret &quot;A&quot;, 286 degrees; turret &quot;B&quot;, 270 degrees; turret &quot;Y&quot;, 270 degrees. Training and elevating was done by hydraulic drives, with rates of two and eight degrees per second, respectively. A full gun broadside weighed , and a salvo could be fired every 40 seconds. The secondary armament consisted of 16 QF Mk I guns which were mounted in eight twin mounts, weighing 81 tons each. The maximum range of the Mk I guns was at 45 degrees with HE shell at , the anti-aircraft ceiling was . The guns could be elevated to 70 degrees and depressed to 5 degrees. The nominal rate of fire was ten to twelve rounds per minute, but in practice the guns could only fire seven to eight rounds per minute. Upon commissioning, along with her main and secondary batteries, &quot;Howe&quot; carried 48 QF 2 pdr Mk.VIII &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft guns and 18 Oerlikon AA guns 

==Operational history==
===Home Fleet===
&quot;Howe&quot; joined the Home Fleet on 30 August 1942, her building time extended, owing to more urgent demands of the industry. Like her sister ship &quot;Anson&quot;, she spent the early years of her combat career in Arctic waters, covering convoys bound for Russia. On 31 December 1942, &quot;Howe&quot; and her sister ship provided distant cover for convoy RA 51, which safely arrived in Loch Ewe on 9 January 1943. &quot;Howe&quot; and &quot;King George V&quot; also provided distant cover for convoy RA 53 on 1 March 1943 and helped to recover merchantmen whose ships had been sunk. In 1943 &quot;Howe&quot; was transferred to Gibraltar with &quot;King George V&quot; to take part in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily; the US battleships &quot;Alabama&quot; and &quot;South Dakota&quot; substituted for their absence from the Home Fleet. The two British ships shelled Trapani naval base and Favignana during 11–12 July. Based in Algiers, the pair also offered cover during Operation Avalanche—the Allied landings at Salerno—setting out on 7 September. On 14 September &quot;Howe&quot; and &quot;King George V&quot; escorted the surrendered Italian battleships &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; and &quot;Italia&quot; to Alexandria.

By the end of October 1943, &quot;Howe&quot; and &quot;King George V&quot; had returned to Britain. At the end of year, &quot;Howe&quot; underwent a long overhaul at Devonport, where a number of alterations were made. Her anti-aircraft armament was increased, changes were made to her radar, and her watertight integrity in the stern was improved. Modifications were accomplished in the officers and crew quarters for operations in tropical climates; these included changes in insulation, and the extensive use of air-conditioning equipment.

=== Pacific operations ===
On 8 August 1944, &quot;Howe&quot; arrived at Trincomalee in Ceylon to join the Eastern Fleet. She was the first modern British battleship to be deployed in eastern waters since the loss of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; in December 1941. &quot;Howe&quot; was put into action quickly, providing cover for carrier based air operations against targets in Sumatra. In December she moved to Sydney, where she sailed to Auckland, New Zealand, to show the flag. In February 1945, &quot;Howe&quot; and &quot;King George V&quot; sailed from Sydney to begin operations in earnest in the Pacific theatre; together with four carriers, five cruisers and fifteen destroyers, they made up Task Force 113.

The first major undertaking for Task Force 113 (now redesignated TF.57) was Operation Iceberg—offshore support for the US landings at Okinawa—which got under way on 1 April 1945. The force was subjected to sporadic Japanese kamikaze attacks, but the two ships emerged unscathed from these actions. &quot;Howe&#x27;s&quot; anti-aircraft batteries also succeeded in shooting down an attacking kamikaze plane. The two ships&#x27; principal roles were air defence and land bombardment, the latter being carried out very accurately, particularly by &quot;Howe&quot; against anti-aircraft installations on the island of Miyako, half way between Okinawa and Formosa.

=== Post-war activity===
By the first week of June 1945, &quot;Howe&quot; was back in Sydney, and almost immediately it was decided to send her for a refit in Durban. It was here that she saw out the remainder of the war. She was relocated back to Portsmouth by January 1946. In 1951, &quot;Howe&quot; was placed in reserve and towed to Devonport. She was ordered scrapped in 1957, as she and other battleships were increasingly deemed to have been made obsolete by aircraft and no longer needed as a defence against Soviet cruisers. On 27 May 1958, &quot;Howe&quot; was towed to Inverkeithing to be broken up by Thos. W. Ward. The Royal Navy presented the ship&#x27;s bell to St Giles&#x27; Cathedral in Edinburgh. In 2012, it was reported that parts from one of the gun turrets may still exist, having been re-used as a turntable at Dounreay nuclear laboratory.

== Refits ==
During her career, &quot;Howe&quot; was refitted on several occasions to bring her equipment up to date:

==Artefacts==

A large model of HMS &quot;Howe&quot;, from her builder around the time she was laid down, is on display in the Riverside Museum in Glasgow.

<text>HMS &quot;Rodney&quot; was one of two s built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1920s. The ship entered service in 1928, and spent her peacetime career with the Atlantic and Home Fleets, sometimes serving as a flagship when her sister ship, , was being refitted. During the early stages of the Second World War, she searched for German commerce raiders, participated in the Norwegian Campaign, and escorted convoys in the Atlantic Ocean. &quot;Rodney&quot; played a major role in the sinking of the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; in mid-1941.

After a brief refit in the United States, she escorted convoys to Malta and supported the Allied invasion of French Algeria during Operation Torch in late 1942. The ship covered the invasions of Sicily (Operation Husky) and Italy (Operation Baytown) in mid-1943. During the Normandy landings in June 1944, &quot;Rodney&quot; provided naval gunfire support and continued to do so for several following offensives near the French city of Caen. The ship escorted one convoy through the Arctic to the Soviet Union in late 1944. In poor condition from extremely heavy use and a lack of refits, she was reduced to reserve in late 1945 and was scrapped in 1948.

==Background and description==

The &quot;Nelson&quot;-class battleship was essentially a smaller, battleship version of the G3 battlecruiser which had been cancelled for exceeding the constraints of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty. The design, which had been approved six months after the treaty was signed, had a main armament of guns to match the firepower of the American and Japanese es in the battleline in a ship displacing no more than .

&quot;Rodney&quot; had a length between perpendiculars of and an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at standard load. She displaced at standard load and at deep load. Her crew numbered 1,361 officers and ratings when serving as a flagship and 1,314 as a private ship. The ship was powered by two sets of Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam from eight Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines were rated at and intended to give the ship a maximum speed of 23 knots. During her sea trials on 7 September 1927, &quot;Rodney&quot; reached a top speed of from . The ship carried enough fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and fire control===

The main battery of the &quot;Nelson&quot;-class ships consisted of nine breech-loading (BL) guns in three triple-gun turrets forward of the superstructure. Designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; from front to rear, &#x27;B&#x27; turret superfired over the others. Their secondary armament consisted of a dozen BL Mk XXII guns in twin-gun turrets aft of the superstructure, three turrets on each broadside. Their anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of six quick-firing (QF) Mk VIII guns in unshielded single mounts and eight QF 2-pounder () guns in single mounts. The ships were fitted with two submerged 24.5-inch (622 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside, angled 10° off the centreline.

The &quot;Nelson&quot;s were built with two fire-control directors fitted with rangefinders. One was mounted above the bridge and the other was at the aft end of the superstructure. Each turret was also fitted with a rangefinder. The secondary armament was controlled by four directors equipped with rangefinders. One pair were mounted on each side of the main director on the bridge roof and the others were abreast the aft main director. The anti-aircraft directors were situated on a tower abaft the main-armament director with a 12-foot high-angle rangefinder in the middle of the tower. A pair of torpedo-control directors with 15-foot rangefinders were positioned abreast the funnel.

===Protection===
The ships&#x27; waterline belt consisted of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick between the main gun barbettes and thinned to over the engine and boiler rooms as well as the six-inch magazines, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. To improve its ability to deflect plunging fire, its upper edge was inclined 18° outward. The ends of the armoured citadel were closed off by transverse bulkheads of non-cemented armour thick at the forward end and thick at the aft end. The faces of the main-gun turrets were protected by 16-inch of KC armour while the turret sides were thick and the roof armour plates measured in thickness.

The KC armour of the barbettes ranged in thickness from . The top of the armoured citadel of the &quot;Nelson&quot;-class ships was protected by an armoured deck that rested on the top of the belt armour. Its non-cemented armour plates ranged in thickness from over the main-gun magazines to over the propulsion machinery spaces and the secondary magazines. Aft of the citadel was an armoured deck thick at the level of the lower edge of the belt armour that extended almost to the end of the stern to cover the steering gear. The conning tower&#x27;s KC armour was thick with a roof. The secondary-gun turrets were protected by of non-cemented armour.Underwater protection for the &quot;Nelson&quot;s was provided by a double bottom deep and a torpedo protection system. It consisted of an empty outer watertight compartment and an inner water-filled compartment. They had a total depth of and were backed by a torpedo bulkhead 1.5 inches thick.
===Design deficiencies===
The &quot;Nelson&quot; class was an innovative design, but limited by the constraints of the Washington Naval Treaty. The decision to use 16-inch guns combined with the 35,000-ton displacement limit made saving weight the primary concern of designers. The Director of Naval Construction, Eustace Tennyson d&#x27;Eyncourt, informed the ship&#x27;s designer, Edward Attwood, &quot;In order to keep the displacement to 35,000 tons, everything is to be cut down to a minimum.&quot; The emphasis on saving weight resulted in deficiencies which affected the performance of &quot;Rodney&quot; during the Second World War. The design compromises had less negative consequences for &quot;Nelson&quot; because that ship underwent a number of refits immediately before and during the war. Naval architect and historian David K. Brown stated, &quot;It seems likely that in the quest for weight saving, the structure was not quite strong enough.&quot; Unlike &quot;Nelson&quot;, which exceeded the design specification for machinery weight, the lighter machinery of &quot;Rodney&quot; resulted in chronic problems.The ship&#x27;s endurance declined substantially in the decade after her launch; in her 1941 action against &quot;Bismarck&quot;, &quot;Rodney&quot; was nearly forced to abandon the pursuit because of a lack of fuel. British designers cited the poor endurance of the ship when establishing the endurance requirements for the battleship . Throughout the war &quot;Rodney&quot; was plagued with leaks as a result of panting, and the ship required repairs because of serious leaks in 1940, 1941 and 1944. During one storm, the leaking was severe enough to overwhelm a 50-ton pump. Leaks, defective riveting, and other problems continued to affect &quot;Rodney&quot; even after a 1941 refit in Boston, Massachusetts.By 1943 officials concluded that she required a complete modernization to extend her service life. The ship never received the necessary upgrades and as a result was unfit for service by the end of 1944.

===Modifications===

The high-angle directors and rangefinder and their platform were replaced by a new circular platform for the High Angle Control System (HACS) Mk I director by March 1930. By July 1932, the single two-pounder guns and the starboard torpedo director were removed and replaced by a single octuple two-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; mount on the starboard side of the funnel and a rangefinder was added at the rear of the bridge roof. The port side mount was installed several years later in the position occupied by the port torpedo director and anti-aircraft directors for both mounts were added to the bridge structure. In 1934–1935, &quot;Rodney&quot; was fitted with a pair of quadruple mounts for Vickers AA machineguns that were positioned on the forward superstructure. The ship was fitted with an aircraft catapult on the roof of &#x27;X&#x27; turret and a collapsible crane abreast the bridge was also added in 1937 to hoist the aircraft in and out of the water. A floatplane version of the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber was first used aboard, but it was soon replaced by a Supermarine Walrus amphibian. In October 1938 another octuple &quot;pom-pom&quot; mount was added on the quarterdeck and a prototype Type 79Y early-warning radar system was installed on &quot;Rodney&quot;″s masthead. She was the first battleship to be so equipped.
During a brief refit in HM Dockyard, Rosyth, Scotland, from 24 August to 10 September 1940, the Type 79Y radar was upgraded to a Type 279 system and two Oerlikon light AA guns were installed on the roof of &#x27;B&#x27; turret. While &quot;Rodney&quot; was refitting in the Boston Navy Yard in the United States in June–August 1941, the Oerlikons were replaced by a quadruple two-pounder mount and a pair of octuple two-pounder mounts were fitted in lieu of the aft six-inch gunnery directors. In addition a full suite of radars were added. A Type 281 radar replaced the Type 279, a Type 271 surface-search radar was installed as was a Type 284 gunnery radar on the roof of the forward main-gun director. The ship&#x27;s light AA armament was heavily reinforced during a refit in February–May 1942 with seventeen 20 mm Oerlikons in single mounts added to turret roofs, the superstructure and the decks. The quadruple 0.5-inch mounts were replaced with Mk III &quot;pom-pom&quot; directors and three additional Mk IIIs were installed to control the aft octuple two-pounder mounts, all of which were fitted with Type 282 fire-control radars. The HACS Mk I was replaced by a Mk III director and four barrage (anti-aircraft) directors with Type 283 radars were added for the main guns. In addition her radar suite was upgraded: the Type 271 radar was replaced by a Type 273 system, a Type 291 early-warning radar was added and a Type 285 fire-control radar was installed on the roof of the HACS director.

While under repair at Rosyth in August–September, four additional Oerlikons were added on the quarterdeck. In May 1943 gun shields were added to the 4.7-inch guns and the catapult on the roof of &#x27;X&#x27; turret was removed. Many more Oerlikons were installed during this brief refit, specifically 36 more single mounts and 5 twin mounts, which gave &quot;Rodney&quot; a total of 67 weapons in 57 single and 5 twin mounts. In preparation for her role providing naval gunfire support during the Normandy landings, two more Oerlikons were added as was a Type 650 radio jammer in January–March 1944. These additions increased the ship&#x27;s deep displacement to and her crew to 1,631–1,650 men.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Rodney&quot;, named for Admiral Lord George Rodney, was the sixth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. Given the yard number 904, she was laid down on 28 December 1922 as part of the 1922 Naval Programme at Cammell Laird&#x27;s shipyard in Birkenhead and was launched on 17 December 1925 by Princess Mary, Viscountess Lascelles, after three attempts at cracking the bottle of Imperial Burgundy. She was completed and her trials began in August 1927 and she was commissioned on 7 December under the command of Captain Henry Kitson. The ship cost £7,617,799. The &quot;Nelson&quot;-class ships received several nicknames: &quot;Rodnol&quot; and &quot;Nelsol&quot; after the Royal Fleet Auxiliary oil tankers with a prominent amidships superstructure and names ending in &quot;ol&quot;, &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Mansions&quot; after a resemblance between her superstructure and the Queen Anne&#x27;s Mansions block of flats, the &quot;pair of boot&quot;, the &quot;ugly sisters&quot; and the &quot;Cherry Tree class&quot; as they were cut-down by the Washington Naval Treaty. &quot;Rodney&quot;″s trials resumed after she was formally commissioned and continued until she entered service on 28 March 1928.The ship was assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet (renamed as Home Fleet in March 1932) and remained so, aside from refits or repairs, until 1941. On 21 April, Kitson was relieved by Captain Francis Tottenham. The following month she headed north to Invergordon, Scotland, to join the rest of the Atlantic Fleet in the annual exercises. &quot;Rodney&quot; returned to the south in August, where she was the Royal Guardship during Cowes Week where the ship hosted King George V and Queen Mary of Teck on 11 August. The battleship then sailed to HM Dockyard, Devonport, to participate in a charity fund-raising Navy Week which saw 67,000 visitors come to the dockyard. &quot;Rodney&quot; had some work done on her hull in Glasgow&#x27;s Gladstone Dock in early October.

At the beginning of 1929, the Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleets combined for their annual fleet manoeuvres in the Mediterranean Sea. While visiting Torquay, Devon, for a fleet rendezvous in July, &quot;Rodney&quot; was ordered to go to the assistance of two submarines that had collided off Milford Haven, Wales, on 9 July. Ordered to steam at full speed, the ship arrived at Pembroke Dock the following morning to load rescue and salvage equipment. Delayed for a day by weather too bad for diving, she arrived at the site the following evening but it was too late for any survivors of and &quot;Rodney&quot; set sail for HM Dockyard, Portsmouth. The ship&#x27;s propulsion machinery was proving troublesome by this time and she was docked there in late September for a refit that took the rest of the year. Captain Andrew Cunningham, later First Sea Lord, relieved Tottenham on 15 December.

Aside from the usual schedule of exercises, 1930 saw &quot;Rodney&quot; visit Portrush, Northern Ireland in June, which named a street after the battleship and a voyage to Iceland to commemorate the thousandth year of the Icelandic Parliament. Cunningham was relieved by Captain Roger Bellairs on 16 December. In mid-September 1931, the crew of &quot;Rodney&quot; took part in the Invergordon Mutiny when they refused orders to go to sea for an exercise, although they relented after several days when the Admiralty reduced the severity of the pay cuts that prompted the mutiny. Unhappy with how Bellairs had handled the crew during the mutiny, the Admiralty ordered that he was to be relieved by Captain John Tovey on 12 April 1932.

After &quot;Nelson&quot; ran aground while leaving Portsmouth in January 1934, &quot;Rodney&quot; became the temporary fleet flagship when Admiral Lord William Boyle, commander of the Home Fleet, hoisted his flag aboard her for the winter cruise to the British West Indies. The fleet visited two Norwegian ports before returning home. Captain Wilfred Custance relieved Tovey on 31 August. The 1935 winter cruise saw the ship return to the West Indies, before visiting the Azores and then Gibraltar between 15 January and 17 March. The ship participated in King George V&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Fleet Review at Spithead on 16 July and then again served as the Royal Guardship during Cowes Week. Captain William Whitworth replaced Custance on 21 February 1936 and he was relieved in his turn by Captain Ronald Halifax on 25 July.

Some of &quot;Rodney&quot;″s crew travelled to London to participate in King George VI&#x27;s Coronation on 12 May 1937 and the ship took part in the Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May. She again became the temporary fleet flagship when &quot;Nelson&quot; began a lengthy refit the following month and Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse hoisted his flag aboard her. &quot;Rodney&quot; visited Oslo, Norway, in July. &quot;Nelson&quot;″s refit ended in February 1938 and the sisters made a port visit to Lisbon, Portugal that same month. Captain Edward Syfret relieved Whitworth on 16 August, shortly before &quot;Rodney&quot; began her annual short refit in September. After the completion of her post-refit trials in January 1939, Rear-Admiral Lancelot Holland hoisted his flag aboard the ship as the commander of the 2nd Battle Squadron. She fired a 21-gun salute in honour of the French President Albert Lebrun&#x27;s arrival in Dover in March for talks with the British government. As the Home Fleet was assembling in Scapa Flow when tensions with Germany rose in August, &quot;Rodney&quot; developed steering problems and had to proceed to Rosyth for repairs and a bottom cleaning.

===Second World War===
====1939====
When Great Britain declared war on Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939, &quot;Rodney&quot; and the bulk of the Home Fleet were patrolling the waters between Iceland, Norway and Scotland for German blockade runners and then did much the same off the Norwegian coast from 6 to 10 September. The Home Fleet was already at sea when the submarine , on patrol in the Heligoland Bight, was badly damaged by German depth charges on 24 September. Unable to submerge, she requested assistance and the fleet responded with two destroyers escorting her home and the balance of the fleet providing cover. The Germans spotted the bulk of the Home Fleet and it was attacked by five bombers from the first group of Bomber Wing 30 (I./KG 30). &quot;Rodney&quot;″s radar provided timely warning and the aircraft inflicted no damage on the British ships. The following month the ship was part of the covering force for an iron ore convoy from Narvik, Norway.

Syfret was relieved by Captain Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton on 21 November. Following the sinking of the armed merchant cruiser two days later by the German battleships and off Iceland, &quot;Rodney&quot; and the rest of the Home Fleet were sent to look for them but heavy weather allowed the German battleships to evade their pursuers and return to Germany. The battleship developed serious problems with her rudder on 29 November and was forced to return to Liverpool, steering only with her engines, for repairs that lasted until 31 December.

====1940====

With &quot;Nelson&quot; damaged by a mine on 4 December, &quot;Rodney&quot; served as the temporary fleet flagship until her sister&#x27;s return in August. She mostly spent January and February 1940 at anchor with occasional missions to provide cover from commerce raiders for convoys. During one such sortie on 21 February in heavy weather, her steering problems resurfaced and forced her return to Greenock, Scotland. Six days later, the ship was visited by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth during their morale-boosting tour of Scottish shipyards. The First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill (soon to become Prime Minister) boarded &quot;Rodney&quot; for a voyage to Scapa Flow on 7 to 8 March. Despite the danger of aerial attack by the Luftwaffe, most of the Home Fleet was now based there; &quot;Rodney&quot; was near-missed during an attack on 16 March.

Receiving word that the Royal Air Force (RAF) had attacked north-bound German warships in the North Sea on 7 April, Admiral Sir Charles Forbes, Commander-in-chief Home Fleet, ordered most of his ships to put to sea that evening. &quot;Rodney&quot; was hit by a bomb on 9 April off the south-western coast of Norway. The bomb broke up after hitting the corner of a armoured 4.7-inch ready ammunition box on the upper deck aft of the funnel; its fragments penetrated through several decks before bouncing off the four-inch armoured deck and started a small fire in the galley. Three men were wounded by the bomb and another fifteen suffered electrical burns when water being used to fight the fire poured onto a junction box. The crew made temporary repairs and the ship remained at sea until she dropped anchor at Scapa Flow on 17 April. Upon receiving notice that German ships had been spotted in the Norwegian Sea on 9 June, Forbes ordered the Home Fleet, including &quot;Rodney&quot;, to sea to protect troop convoys evacuating Allied forces from Norway.

&quot;Nelson&quot; returned from the dockyard on 24 July and reassumed her role as the Home Fleet flagship. &quot;Rodney&quot; was transferred from Scapa Flow to Rosyth on 23 August with orders to attack the German invasion fleet in the English Channel when Operation Sealion began. She returned to Scapa on 4 November to begin convoy escort duty. After the armed merchant cruiser was sunk the following day by the heavy cruiser , the sisters were deployed to the Iceland–Faeroes gap to block any attempts by the German cruiser to return home. The following month &quot;Rodney&quot; was detailed to rendezvous with Convoy HX 93 from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and escort it home. The ship encountered a strong storm with gale-force winds from 6 to 8 December that caused leaks in her hull plating with a moderate amount of flooding. Repairs at Rosyth began on 18 December that included structural reinforcement of the hull plating and general reinforcement of the forward hull structure.

====1941====
After finishing her refit on 13 January 1941, &quot;Rodney&quot; joined the hunt for &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, without success and then escorted Convoy HX 108 from 12 to 23 February. On 16 March, the ship spotted the latter battleship while escorting Convoy HX 114 in the North Atlantic; &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was rescuing survivors from the independently steaming reefer ship, , when &quot;Rodney&quot; steamed over the horizon, silhouetted against the setting sun. Partially hidden behind the burning merchant ship, the gunnery officer estimated that the intermittently visible German ship was away, close to maximum range for &quot;Rodney&quot;″s guns. Dalyrmple-Hamilton declined to pursue &quot;Gneisenau&quot; when she turned away at her top speed of and was able to rescue 27 survivors and 2 dead seamen from one lifeboat before returning to her convoy. Troop Convoy TC 10 departed Halifax on 10 April with a strong escort that included &quot;Rodney&quot;. While steaming south out of the River Clyde in the early hours of 19 April, the battleship accidentally rammed and sank the armed trawler &quot;Topaze&quot;; only four survivors could be rescued by nearby destroyers (other sources state two survivors or no survivors)

====&quot;Bismarck&quot;====

On 22 May 1941, &quot;Rodney&quot; and four destroyers were part of the escort for the ocean liner as she set sail for Halifax. The battleship was scheduled to continue onwards to Boston for repairs and a refit. To this end, the ship carried some of the materials, such as boiler tubes and three octuple &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts intended for use in her refit; other cargo included three or four crates of the Elgin Marbles. She also carried 521 military passengers bound for Halifax, as well as an American assistant naval attaché conveying important documents back to the United States. &quot;Britannic&quot; was taking civilians to Canada and would be bringing Canadian troops and airmen back to Britain.

After &quot;Bismarck&quot; sank the battlecruiser during the Battle of Denmark Strait on the morning of 24 May, &quot;Rodney&quot; was ordered by the Admiralty to join in the pursuit of the German ship, leaving the destroyer to escort &quot;Britannic&quot; and taking , and with her in the search. After the heavy cruiser radioed that she had lost radar contact with the &quot;Bismarck&quot; at 04:01 on the morning of 25 May, Dalrymple-Hamilton, after consulting his senior officers and the American attaché, decided that the German ship was probably heading for Brest and so set course to the east to head her off, at some stages reaching twenty-five knots, which exceeded her designed maximum speed by , although this caused several mechanical failures Later that morning, Admiral Sir John Tovey in the battleship ordered all ships to head north west due to a misinterpreted signal from the Admiralty but Dalrymple-Hamilton knew that his ship was too slow to catch up to &quot;Bismarck&quot; if she was headed in that direction and disregarded Tovey&#x27;s order. The Admiralty informed Dalrymple-Hamilton that they believed that &quot;Bismarck&quot; was probably headed to Brest or Saint Nazaire at 11:40. The captain subsequently altered course further south east to cover the approaches to Spanish ports where the German ship might intern herself but this was countermanded by an Admiralty order to turn north east at 14:30. Dalrymple-Hamilton continued south east for several more hours before he decided to obey the order at 16:20; during this time &quot;Bismarck&quot; passed his position just under the horizon, about away. Not having spotted the German ship by 21:00, Dalrymple-Hamilton decided to turn south-east again, heading directly for Brest.
&quot;Bismarck&quot; was spotted by a RAF Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat at 10:35 on 26 May and the two battleships were able to join up as Tovey had realised his mistake and doubled back. Despite the heavy weather, the aircraft carrier launched her first attack, by 14 Swordfish torpedo bombers, against the German ship that afternoon. The pilots mistook the light cruiser for the &quot;Bismarck&quot; and attacked, although the cruiser was able to evade the six of eleven torpedoes dropped that did not detonate when they hit the sea due to faulty magnetic detonators. Around dusk, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; launched an attack by 15 Swordfish, whose torpedoes had been fitted with contact detonators. Despite the heavy anti-aircraft fire, the Swordfish hit &quot;Bismarck&quot; with three torpedoes. Two of them struck forward of the aft gun turrets and caused no significant damage; the last struck the stern, disabled the battleship&#x27;s steering and caused her to significantly reduce speed. That evening Tovey detached &quot;Mashona&quot; and &quot;Somali&quot; to refuel and had &quot;Rodney&quot; fall in behind &quot;King George V&quot; for the battle against &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Although his ships could catch the German ship that night now that her steering had been disabled and her engines damaged, Tovey decided to reduce speed to save fuel and wait until dawn to allow his ships the maximum amount of time in which to sink the German ship.

&quot;Rodney&quot; spotted &quot;Bismarck&quot; at 08:44 on 27 May, one minute after &quot;King George V&quot; and was the first to open fire at a range of three minutes later with &quot;Bismarck&quot; replying at 08:49. The initial salvos from both ships were off but &quot;Rodney&quot; straddled her opponent with her third salvo and hit her twice with her fourth at 09:02, knocking out the forward superfiring turret, disabling the lower turret and severely damaging her bridge. In her turn, &quot;Bismarck&quot; scored no hits, although she managed to damage &quot;Rodney&quot; with shell splinters before her forward guns were knocked out. As the British ship manoeuvred to bring &#x27;X&#x27; turret to bear while closing the distance, she exposed herself to fire from &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s aft turrets, which only managed to straddle &quot;Rodney&quot;. As the range diminished, she began to fire torpedoes, although shock waves from near misses caused the door for her starboard tube to jam at 09:23. At 09:31, the ship blew off the left barrel of the &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s lower aft gun turret and started a fire inside the turret that forced its evacuation. Around this time the combined fire from &quot;Rodney&quot;, &quot;King George V&quot; and the heavy cruisers and knocked out all of &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s main guns. &quot;Rodney&quot; closed to point-blank range and continued to engage, starting to fire full broadsides into &quot;Bismarck&quot; on a virtually flat trajectory, and added three more torpedoes at a range of beginning at 09:51; one of these malfunctioned but another may have struck &quot;Bismarck&quot;. According to the naval historian Ludovic Kennedy, who was present at the battle in &quot;Tartar&quot;, &quot;if true, [this is] the only instance in history of one battleship torpedoing another.&quot;

&quot;Rodney&quot; fired 378 sixteen-inch shells and 706 six-inch shells during the battle before Dalrymple-Hamilton ordered cease fire around 10:16, while &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was then ordered to finish &quot;Bismarck&quot; off with torpedoes. Ironically, &quot;Rodney&quot;″s own main guns firing at low elevation had damaged her more extensively than had &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Deck plates around the main-gun turrets had been depressed by the effects of the guns&#x27; muzzle blast, and some of the structural members supporting them had cracked or buckled. Piping, urinals and water mains had broken, while the shock of firing had loosened rivets and bolts in the hull plating, flooding various compartments. One gun in &#x27;A&#x27; turret permanently broke down during the battle and two others in &#x27;B&#x27; turret were temporarily disabled.

&quot;Rodney&quot; and &quot;King George V&quot;, running short on fuel, were ordered home and were ineffectually attacked by a pair of Luftwaffe bombers the next day. The former ship arrived at Greenock to replenish her ammunition, fuel and supplies on 29 May and departed for Halifax on 4 June together with the ocean liner , escorted by four destroyers. &quot;Rodney&quot; continued to the Boston Navy Yard for the delayed repairs to her propulsion machinery and her self-inflicted damage from the battle where she arrived on 12 June. Since the repairs took several months to complete, &quot;Rodney&quot;″s crew was furloughed to local Civilian Conservation Corps camps for a fortnight. During the refit, Dalrymple-Hamilton was relieved by Captain James Rivett-Carnac and &quot;Rodney&quot; departed Boston for Bermuda on 20 August to work up. The ship arrived in Gibraltar on 24 September to join Force H.

====Force H and subsequent operations====
&quot;Rodney&quot; departed Gibraltar later that day to join her sister in escorting a convoy to Malta in Operation Halberd. During the operation the ship accidentally shot down a Fleet Air Arm Fairey Fulmar fighter and &quot;Nelson&quot; was torpedoed. She was initially able to keep up with the convoy, but had to turn back on 28 September 1941, followed shortly afterwards by &quot;Rodney&quot; and . With &quot;Nelson&quot; forced to return home for repairs, Vice-Admiral James Somerville transferred his flag to &quot;Rodney&quot; on 30 September. The ship&#x27;s tenure with Force H was brief, with her only mission escorting two carriers flying off fighters for Malta from 16 to 19 October. On 30 October, she was ordered to return home to replace the departing &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; in the Home Fleet in case the battleship attempted to break out into the North Atlantic.

Departing on 2 November, she arrived at Loch Ewe, Scotland, six days later, but only remained there for a few hours to off-load her passengers and re-provision before departing for Hvalfjord, Iceland, where she arrived on 12 November. The highlight of &quot;Rodney&quot;″s initial stay in Iceland was a visit by the movie star, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., who was also stationed there aboard an American battleship. The ship was transferred to Scapa Flow in late December, but was ordered back to Hvalfjord in mid-January 1942 where she was briefly used as a target ship for United States Army Air Force aviators.

====1942====
&quot;Rodney&quot; was ordered to proceed to Birkenhead for a refit on 10 February and then sailed to Liverpool, where she remained until 5 May, when the ship was ordered to return to Scapa to begin working up with &quot;Nelson&quot;. The sisters began escorting Convoy WS 19, loaded with troops bound for Egypt or Burma, on 4 June. They continued as far south as the coast of Portuguese Angola before turning back on 26 June. The following day, &quot;Rodney&quot;″s steering began malfunctioning despite repair attempts. The sisters reached Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 1 July where the ship docked for repairs. Departing on 17 July, the sisters headed home, although &quot;Rodney&quot;″s steering problems soon resurfaced. The ship arrived at Scapa on 26 July where she began cleaning her boilers and requested assistance from Rosyth Dockyard to fix her steering gear.
She departed Scapa on 2 August with orders for convoy escort duties, but was soon diverted to become part of the close escort for Convoy WS 21S, bound for Malta as part of Operation Pedestal. Vice-Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, second-in-command of the Home Fleet, was aboard the ship to gain experience in integrating carrier and convoy operations and was not flying his flag. &quot;Rodney&quot; rendezvoused with the convoy two days later and was assigned to Force Z which would turn back before the convoy passed through the Sicilian Narrows. Italian spies in Algeciras, Francoist Spain, spotted the convoy as it passed through the Strait of Gibraltar on 10 August and Italian reconnaissance aircraft located it the following morning. The opened what would be many Axis attacks on the convoy and its escorts, by sinking the carrier that afternoon. Later that evening, the battleship was attacked by two bombers that near missed with two bombs and a torpedo. The ship was able to comb the tracks between two torpedoes dropped by Italian aircraft at 07:45 on 12 August. Her gunners claimed an Italian bomber at 12:17.

Twenty minutes later, &quot;Rodney&quot; opened fire with her main guns on a wave of approaching Italian torpedo bombers, hoping to knock some of them down with shell splashes, which &quot;frightened us, our escort and [the] Italians&quot;. The ship was near missed many times that afternoon and her steering gear began acting up around 14:00, but the engineers were able to keep it semi-operational. At 18:42, &quot;Rodney&quot; was attacked by Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers flown by the Regia Aeronautica&#x27;s 102nd Dive Domber Group. Although the ship shot down one of her attackers, one armour-piecing bomb bounced off the roof of &#x27;X&#x27; turret, wounding four Royal Marines manning the Oerlikons there, and two others detonated near by as the ship was trying to evade the bombs. The evasive manoeuvres worsened &quot;Rodney&quot;″s steering problems and issues with her boilers began after Force Z turned back that evening which limited the ship to . They arrived at Gibraltar on 14 August and temporary repairs were made. &quot;Rodney&quot; departed Gibraltar to rejoin the Home Fleet at Scapa two days later, but her problems worsened during the voyage as heavy weather further stressed the steering motors and exacerbated her many leaks. The ship was sent to Rosyth for repairs on 22 August.

With her repairs completed on 16 September, &quot;Rodney&quot; arrived back at Scapa on 23 September but almost immediately set sail for Loch Cairnbawn where the British had created a replica of the defences around &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. The battleship was to serve as a target for frogmen training to use Chariot manned torpedoes to deliver and attach limpet mines to her hull in preparation for Operation Title. &quot;Rodney&quot; returned to Scapa on 29 September where she spent most of October training in preparation for the invasion of Northwest Africa scheduled for the following month. Churchill visited the ship on 10 October and thanked the crew for their efforts during Pedestal. &quot;Rodney&quot; set sail for Gibraltar on 23 October and rejoined Force H upon her arrival.
Force H was to provide distant cover for the landings at Algiers and Oran, French Algeria, in case either the Vichy French Navy or the Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy) attempted to intervene. If that did not happen, &quot;Rodney&quot; was to support the Centre Naval Task Force at Oran on 8 November. Other ships had dealt with the warships in Oran&#x27;s port of Mers-el-Kebir but the four coast-defence guns of Fort du Santon overlooking the harbour were still shooting at the British ships. &quot;Rodney&quot; fired 16 shells from her main guns before she was forced to disengage in response to a reported submarine but the French chose not to return fire. The ship resumed firing later that afternoon, again without reply. The following morning the French guns opened fire as the battleship closed the range, nearly hitting her. &quot;Rodney&quot; moved further out to sea and resumed her bombardment with the aid of a land-based spotter. Her shelling thus far had not had much effect on the fort as its guns began bombarding approaching American troops. At their request, the battleship resumed firing at the fort despite the presence of nearby troops and the French capitulated shortly afterwards.
====1943====

&quot;Rodney&quot; remained in the Mediterranean until she departed for Devonport on 7 May 1943 to begin a brief refit that lasted until 28 May. The ship arrived at Scapa on 3 June to begin training for the invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) and then rejoined Force H. She saw no combat during the landings, although there were many air raids while she was berthed in Grand Harbour, Malta. On 31 August &quot;Rodney&quot; joined her sister in bombarding coast-defence guns near Reggio di Calabria in preparation for the Allied crossing of the Strait of Messina from Sicily (Operation Baytown) on 3 September, blowing up an ammunition dump during her shoot. Force H provided support for the landings at Salerno (Operation Avalanche) on 9 September with the battleship only using her anti-aircraft guns. Captain Robert FitzRoy relieved Rivett-Carnac on 25 September. The ship arrived back in the UK on 5 November where she rejoined the Home Fleet. While at sea with the to conduct a night gunnery exercise on 29 December, &quot;Rodney&quot; suffered weather damage during a severe storm that caused extensive flooding forward.

====1944 and the Normandy Landings====

The ship departed Scapa on 16 January 1944 to begin repairs in Rosyth. Little effort was made to repair the persistent steering and boiler problems as efforts focused on making her seaworthy again. They were completed on 28 March, and &quot;Rodney&quot; steamed back to Scapa, where she arrived on 1 April. The ship spent most of the next few months conducting gunnery training, mostly shore bombardment but also anti-aircraft shoots and practice defending herself against attacks by E-boats. Although she was initially in reserve for the Normandy landings (Operation Overlord), &quot;Rodney&quot; did engage coast-defence guns near Le Havre with two armour-piercing 16-inch shells on 6 June. The ship was ordered forward to support operations off Sword Beach that night and accidentally rammed and sank &quot;LCT 427&quot;, killing all 13 crewmen, in the darkness and congested waters off the Isle of Wight.

Soon afterwards, another LCT rammed &quot;Rodney&quot;″s bow, tearing a hole in her hull plates and crumpling the bow of the landing craft. After reaching her assigned position, the ship engaged targets north of Caen, possibly belonging to the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend which was attacking British and Canadian troops near there. During her day&#x27;s shooting &quot;Rodney&quot; expended 99 sixteen- and 132 six-inch shells. That night the ship moved to the waters off Juno Beach to avoid attacks by German light forces. Returning to Sword Beach on 8 June, she bombarded German troops and vehicles near Caen. The following morning &quot;Rodney&quot; began engaging targets in Caen proper, beginning the gradual devastation of the city, including the destruction of the spire of the Church of Saint-Pierre. That day the ship also fired at coast-defence guns at Houlgate and Benerville-sur-Mer. After an ineffectual air raid on the ships off Sword Beach that afternoon, &quot;Rodney&quot; withdrew to replenish her ammunition at Milford Haven.

The ship was kept in reserve until 18 June when her sister struck a mine and had to withdraw. A severe storm began the following day and caused all operations to cease. A LCT took shelter in the lee of the battleship for the duration of the storm and a trawler collided with &quot;Rodney&quot; on 21 June but was not seriously damaged. On the night of 23/24 June, the ship was ineffectually attacked twice by Junkers Ju 88 bombers; her gunners claiming one aircraft. Firing for the first time since her return, &quot;Rodney&quot;″s guns began bombarding targets during Operation Epsom, which began on the 26th. These included a sporadic, 30-hour operation firing an occasional shell inland, to prevent a Panzer division from crossing a bridge. The ship also provided fire support during Operation Windsor, a partially successful Canadian assault on Carpiquet and its airfield west of Caen on 4 to 5 July, and Operation Charnwood, a frontal assault on Caen proper on 8 to 9 July. Some of the targets engaged were normally beyond the maximum range of &quot;Rodney&quot;″s guns, but oil was pumped to one side to give the ship a temporary list which acted to increase the guns&#x27; elevation and range. After the end of Charnwood, the ship was withdrawn as Allied forces drove deeper into France. She had expended at total of 519 sixteen- and 454 six-inch shells during her sojourn off the Norman coast.

Long-range artillery on the German-occupied island of Alderney was disrupting Allied operations off the north west corner of the Cotentin Peninsula after the landings in Normandy. &quot;Rodney&quot; was tasked to eliminate the problem and bombarded Batterie Blücher on 12 August, taking up a position on the other side of the Cap de la Hague to avoid return fire. She fired 75 sixteen-inch shells at the artillery position, believing that three of the four guns had been damaged. Postwar analysis showed that although 40 shells had fallen within of the center of the battery, only one gun had actually been damaged and it was back in service by November. The other three guns resumed shooting at Allied ships by 30 August.

====Post Invasion====
After a fortnight in Portland, the ship arrived in Devonport on 27 August for repairs that were originally scheduled to last for a month or more. Her dockyard time was curtailed and &quot;Rodney&quot; was ordered north. She arrived in Scapa on 15 September and sailed the following day to escort Convoy JW 60 bound for Murmansk. The escorts dropped anchor at Vaenga on 23 September after an uneventful passage. Admiral Arseny Golovko visited the ship three days later to coordinate arrangements for defending the convoys. &quot;Rodney&quot; rendezvoused with the returning convoy RA 60 on 28 September. German submarines were able to sink two ships of the convoy against the loss of one of their own and the ship arrived at Scapa on 5 October. She became the Home Fleet flagship four days later when Admiral Sir Henry Moore hoisted his flag aboard her. &quot;Rodney&quot; generally remained at Scapa for the next year, the tedium relieved by a visit by King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and their daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, in late September 1945. The ship steamed south in mid-November, bound for Portsmouth where Moore would transfer his flag to her sister. She arrived at Rosyth on 2 December where she was docked in No. 3 dry dock from 8 December until 1 March 1948; during this time, &quot;Rodney&quot;″s condition was surveyed and her leaks were patched. She was transferred to BISCO early that year for disposal and the ship was allocated to Thos. W. Ward on 26 March to be scrapped at Inverkeithing.

<text>HMS &quot;Revenge&quot; was the lead ship of five super-dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy during the First World War in the mid-1910s. The ships were developments of the s, with reductions in size and speed to offset increases in armour protection whilst retaining the same main battery of eight guns. She was laid down in 1913, launched in 1915 and commissioned in February 1916, early enough to be worked up to see action with the Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in May that year. During the engagement, she engaged German battlecruisers, damaging two of them before being forced to turn away to avoid torpedoes that damaged her squadron flagship and caused the squadron to lose contact with the rest of the fleet. &quot;Revenge&quot; emerged from the battle unscathed, but she saw no further action during the war, as the British and German fleets turned to more cautious strategies owing to the risk of submarines and naval mines.

During the 1920s and 1930s, &quot;Revenge&quot; alternated between the Atlantic Fleet and the Mediterranean Fleet. Whilst serving in the Mediterranean in the early 1920s, the ship went to Turkey twice in response to crises arising from the Greco-Turkish War, including the Great Fire of Smyrna in 1922. The ship&#x27;s interwar career was otherwise uneventful. With the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, &quot;Revenge&quot; was used to escort convoys and transport significant quantities of the country&#x27;s gold reserves to Canada as part of Operation Fish; these activities continued into 1940. She was involved in the seizure of French warships in Portsmouth after the French surrender in July 1940.

In October 1940, she conducted Operation Medium, an attack on German transport ships that had been collected along the English Channel in preparation for the later-cancelled invasion of Britain. &quot;Revenge&quot; thereafter resumed convoy escort duties until October 1941, when she was reassigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron and sent to the Far East as tensions with Japan began to rise. British naval forces were strengthened further after the start of the Pacific War in December, leading to the creation of the Eastern Fleet. &quot;Revenge&quot; and her sister ships were deemed too old to be of use against the Japanese fleet, so they were relegated to convoy escort duties in the Indian Ocean. Badly worn out by 1943, &quot;Revenge&quot; returned home, where she was removed from front-line service. Her last voyage was to carry Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the Tehran Conference in November 1943. Upon returning, she was assigned to the training establishment , disarmed and eventually broken up in 1948.

== Design and description ==

The &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships were designed as slightly smaller, slower, and more heavily protected versions of the preceding s. As an economy measure they were intended to revert to the previous practice of using both fuel oil and coal, but First Sea Lord Jackie Fisher rescinded the decision for coal in October 1914. Still under construction, the ships were redesigned to employ oil-fired boilers that increased the power of the engines by over the original specification.

&quot;Revenge&quot; had a length overall of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She had a displacement of and displaced at deep load. She was powered by two sets of Parsons steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam provided by eighteen Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and intended to reach a maximum speed of , although the ship only reached a top speed of from during her sea trials on 24 March 1916. She had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 940 officers and ratings in 1917. Her metacentric height was at deep load.

The &quot;Revenge&quot; class was equipped with eight breech-loading (BL) Mk I guns in four twin gun turrets, in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Twelve of the fourteen BL Mk XII guns were mounted in casemates along the broadside of the vessel amidships; the remaining pair were mounted on the shelter deck and were protected by gun shields. The ship also mounted four 3-pounder () guns. Her anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of two quick-firing (QF) 20 cwt Mk I guns. She was fitted with four submerged torpedo tubes, two on each broadside.

&quot;Revenge&quot; was completed with two fire-control directors fitted with rangefinders. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and the other was in the spotting top above the tripod foremast. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by &#x27;X&#x27; turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in March 1917. A torpedo-control director with a 15-foot rangefinder was mounted at the aft end of the superstructure.

The ship&#x27;s waterline belt consisted of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick between &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; barbettes and thinned to 4 to 6 inches (102 to 152 mm) towards the ship&#x27;s ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. Above this was a strake of armour 6 inches thick that extended between &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; barbettes. Transverse bulkheads 4 to 6 inches thick ran at an angle from the ends of the thickest part of the waterline belt to &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; barbettes. The gun turrets were protected by of KC armour, except for the turret roofs which were thick. The barbettes ranged in thickness from above the upper deck, but were only 4 to 6 inches thick below it. The &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from in thickness. The main conning tower had 11 inches of armour on the sides with a 3-inch roof. The torpedo director in the rear superstructure had 6 inches of armour protecting it. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the magazines and additional anti-flash equipment was added in the magazines.

The ship was fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. During the 1928 refit the platform was removed from &#x27;X&#x27; turret. The platform on &#x27;B&#x27; turret was removed in 1933.

=== Major alterations ===

&quot;Revenge&quot; was fitted with anti-torpedo bulges between October 1917 and February 1918. They were designed to reduce the effect of torpedo detonations and improve stability. They increased her beam by over 13 feet (4 m) to , her displacement to and reduced her draught to , all at deep load. They increased her metacentric height to . Later in 1918, rangefinders were fitted in &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets. In 1919 her complement was 1,240 officers and ratings.

The gun shields for the shelter-deck six-inch guns were replaced by armoured casemates in 1922. Two years later, her anti-aircraft defences were upgraded by replacing the original three-inch AA guns with a pair of QF AA guns. During the ship&#x27;s 1928–1929 refit, two more four-inch AA guns were added and the six-inch guns from the shelter deck were removed. In addition a High-Angle Control System (HACS) Mk I director was installed on the spotting top. In 1931 one octuple mount for two-pounder Mk VIII &quot;pom-pom&quot; guns was added abreast the funnel (only on the starboard side) for trials. Its director was added abreast and below the fire-control director in the spotting top. The aft torpedo tubes were also removed at that time. The ship&#x27;s 1936–1937 refit saw the removal of the torpedo director and its associated rangefinder. Two years later, &quot;Revenge&quot;″s anti-aircraft defences were strengthened by replacing the single mounts of the AA guns with twin mounts and adding the portside octuple two-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; mount and its director. A HACS Mk III director replaced the Mk I on the roof of the spotting top and another was added in the position formerly occupied by the torpedo director. A pair of quadruple mounts for Vickers .50 machine guns were added abreast the conning tower. The forward torpedo tubes were also removed at that time.

Wartime modifications for the &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships were fairly minimal. &quot;Revenge&quot; was fitted with a Type 279 early-warning radar in 1941. The following year saw the addition of a Type 273 surface-search radar, a pair of Type 285 anti-aircraft gunnery sets and two Type 282 radars for the &quot;pom-poms&quot;. Two four-barrel &quot;pom-poms&quot; were added in late 1941 atop &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets as well as ten 20 mm Oerlikon guns that replaced the quadruple .50-caliber mounts. To save weight and make more room available for the additional crew required to man the new equipment like the radars and Oerlikons, four 6-inch guns were removed in 1943.

== Construction and service ==

=== First World War ===
&quot;Revenge&quot; was laid down at the Vickers shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness on 22 December 1913. She was launched on 29 May 1915 and was commissioned into the Grand Fleet on 1 February 1916, though she was not completed and ready for service until 24 March, with the time between her commissioning and completion including a period of sea trials. The ship cost a total of £2,406,368. On entering service, &quot;Revenge&quot; was assigned to the 6th Division of the 1st Battle Squadron (BS), Grand Fleet, along with the battleships (the divisional and squadron flagship), , and .

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet with 16 dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts, six light cruisers and 31 torpedo boats commanded by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, departed Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet of 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. On the day of the battle, &quot;Revenge&quot; and the rest of the 6th Division, 1st BS were stationed toward the rear of the British line.

The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00, the Grand Fleet approached the scene. Fifteen minutes later, Jellicoe gave the order to turn and deploy the fleet for action. The transition from their cruising formation caused congestion with the rear divisions, forcing &quot;Revenge&quot; and many of the other ships to reduce speed to to avoid colliding with each other. The German fleet quickly came into range and many British ships began to engage them starting at 18:17. The British ships initially had poor visibility and &quot;Revenge&quot; waited several minutes before opening fire at 18:22; her target during this period is unclear, and she may have engaged the crippled cruiser , the German battle line, or both. She fired intermittently for seventeen minutes and made no hits in the haze.

At 19:09, &quot;Revenge&quot; was forced to turn away to avoid a torpedo that was probably launched by the torpedo boat ; the torpedo passed harmlessly in her wake. Shortly thereafter, she engaged the battlecruiser ; her first salvo estimated the range to be , but overshot the target. &quot;Revenge&quot;″s gunlayers quickly brought the range down to and straddled &quot;Derfflinger&quot; with their second salvo. With the range found, &quot;Revenge&quot; quickly scored five hits before shifting fire to the battlecruiser , since other battleships were concentrating their fire on &quot;Derfflinger&quot;. Two of her hits on &quot;Derfflinger&quot; disabled her aft turrets; the other three caused less significant damage, with one of them passing through a funnel without exploding. &quot;Revenge&quot; hit &quot;Von der Tann&quot; once near her aft conning tower at 19:19, doing minor damage; she also fired a torpedo at the ship during this period that failed to hit.

&quot;Revenge&quot; had to turn away again at 19:35 to avoid a pair of torpedoes; she and the other members of the division turned again at 19:42 after reports of a submarine, which proved to be imaginary. &quot;Revenge&quot; saw no further contact with German forces, in large part due to torpedo damage incurred by the squadron flagship, &quot;Marlborough&quot;, that forced the ship to slow significantly. At 01:56 on 1 June, Vice-Admiral Cecil Burney, the squadron commander aboard &quot;Marlborough&quot;, informed &quot;Revenge&quot; that the damage would force him to transfer to &quot;Revenge&quot; to allow &quot;Marlborough&quot; to return to port. He boarded the light cruiser , which carried him to &quot;Revenge&quot; shortly after 03:00. By 10:00, the 6th Division ships were still to the north of the rest of the fleet. &quot;Revenge&quot; and the other two ships finally rejoined the fleet at 19:25 on the way back to Scapa Flow.

In the course of the battle, &quot;Revenge&quot; had fired 102 rounds from her main battery, all of which were of the armour-piercing, capped variety. She also fired 87 rounds from her secondary guns. She was not hit by any fire during the engagement.

====Later operations====
After the action of 19 August 1916, in which the Grand Fleet had lost two light cruisers to German U-boat attacks, Admiral John Jellicoe, the fleet commander, decided that the fleet should not be risked in such sorties unless the High Seas Fleet ventured north or the strategic situation warranted the risk. For its part, the German fleet remained in port or trained in the Baltic Sea through 1917, as both sides had largely abandoned the idea of a decisive surface battle in the North Sea. Both sides turned to positional warfare, laying fields of naval mines, and Germany resumed the unrestricted submarine warfare campaign early in the year. As a result, &quot;Revenge&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet saw no action during the last two years of the war.

In 1917, Britain began running regular convoys to Norway, escorted by light forces; the Germans raided these convoys twice late in the year, prompting Admiral David Beatty, who had replaced Jellicoe the previous year, to send battle squadrons of the Grand Fleet to escort the convoys. The High Seas Fleet went to sea on 23 April to attack one of the escorted convoys, but after the battlecruiser suffered a serious mechanical accident the next day, the Germans were forced to break off the operation. &quot;Revenge&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet sortied on 24 April once they intercepted wireless signals from the damaged &quot;Moltke&quot;, but the Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired.

On 21 November 1918, following the Armistice, the entire Grand Fleet left port to escort the surrendered German fleet into internment at Scapa Flow. At the time, &quot;Revenge&quot; was part of the 1st Battle Squadron, commanded by Vice-Admiral Sydney Fremantle, who made &quot;Revenge&quot; his flagship. The 1st BS was tasked with guarding the fleet while its fate was being determined at the peace treaty negotiations at the Versailles conference. After the Germans scuttled their fleet on 21 June 1919, Fremantle had the German commander, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, brought aboard &quot;Revenge&quot;. Fremantle accused Reuter of violating the terms of the armistice and had him and the German officers taken into captivity as prisoners of war.

=== Inter-war years ===

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, &quot;Revenge&quot; typically operated with her sister ships, apart from periods where they were detached for refit or modernisation. In April 1919, the ships were transferred to the Atlantic Fleet, still as part of the 1st BS. They were then attached to the Mediterranean Fleet for operations in Turkey and the Black Sea as part of Britain&#x27;s responses to the Greco-Turkish War and the Russian Civil War, respectively. On 19 July 1920, &quot;Revenge&quot; went to Panderma, where she encountered several vessels of the Greek Navy, including the armoured cruiser , which had King Alexander of Greece aboard. Alexander visited &quot;Revenge&quot; and met with Fremantle later that day. Over the next day, &quot;Revenge&quot; assisted with Greek landings at Sultanköy and Eregli.

In August 1920, the ships returned to the Atlantic Fleet. The 1st and 2nd Battle Squadrons merged in May 1921, with &quot;Revenge&quot; and her four sisters forming the 1st Division and the five &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class battleships forming the 2nd Division. &quot;Revenge&quot; and three of her sisters were again sent to the Mediterranean Fleet in September 1922 during a crisis in Smyrna that culminated in the Great fire of Smyrna as the Greco-Turkish War came to its conclusion. The ships primarily operated in the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmora. With the war over by November, the ships were free to return once again to the Atlantic Fleet.

On 1 November 1924, the Atlantic Fleet underwent a reorganisation that saw the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class ships sent to the Mediterranean Fleet and the ships of the 1st Division reconstituted as the 1st Battle Squadron. &quot;Revenge&quot; and her sisters were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in August 1927. From January 1928 to January 1929, &quot;Revenge&quot; underwent a refit that included extensive modifications to her secondary and anti-aircraft batteries, fire control equipment, and rebuilding her bridge and aft superstructure, among other changes. She had another refit from May to December 1931 that saw further alterations to her anti-aircraft battery and fire control equipment.

In early 1935, the &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; classes again swapped places, though by this time, the Atlantic Fleet had been renamed the Home Fleet. On 16 July, the ships were present during the fleet review at Spithead for King George V&#x27;s silver jubilee. From July 1936 to March 1937, &quot;Revenge&quot; had another modernisation, which included the removal of the torpedo rangefinder and supporting tower. She and her sisters were present for the Coronation Review for George VI on 20 May 1937. A final pre-war refit began in early 1939 and concluded in August, which included a considerably strengthening of the anti-aircraft battery. On 9 August 1939 she was present during a fleet review for the king at Portland.

=== Second World War ===
====In the Atlantic====
On 3 September 1939 at the start of hostilities, &quot;Revenge&quot; formed part of the Channel Fleet based at Portland. Shortly after the outbreak of the war, the merchant ship was disguised as HMS &quot;Revenge&quot; to deceive German aircraft. On 1 October &quot;Revenge&quot; was ordered to prepare to take up convoy escort duties in the South Atlantic, because of the threat posed by the German &quot;pocket battleship&quot;, ; however, on 5 October 1939, in a change of orders, she was attached to the North Atlantic Escort Force based at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Fulfilling another urgent need at the same time, &quot;Revenge&quot; and her sister were to carry gold bullion to Canada, which was needed by the Anglo-French Purchasing Board in New York, to pay for arms bought from the United States. 148 boxes of gold bars, worth a total of £2 million, were loaded onto each battleship at Portland; they departed on 7 October and arrived in Halifax nine days later. After escorting several convoys, &quot;Revenge&quot; was again used to transport gold, this time to a value of £10 million, departing from Plymouth on 28 January 1940. On 7 February, she collided with the British tanker whilst Convoy HX19 was forming up off Halifax; although lightly damaged, she continued as an escort, returning to Halifax on 18 February for repair.

On 12 May 1940, she accidentally rammed and sank the Canadian which was acting as a boom defence vessel at Halifax, although without loss of life. For the remainder of her service in the war, whenever &quot;Revenge&quot; came to Halifax, the crews of other gate ships would make elaborate and exaggerated &quot;Abandon Ship&quot; manoeuvres in mockery. On 30 May, &quot;Revenge&quot; began to participate in Operation Fish, the removal of all of the United Kingdom&#x27;s gold reserves to Canada, in case of invasion, leaving the River Clyde with £40 million worth of bullion on board, bound for Halifax. The battleship arrived at HM Dockyard, Devonport, on 22 June for a brief refit after escorting Convoy TC 5. On 3 July 1940, while at Plymouth, boarding parties from &quot;Revenge&quot; took control of the and the large submarine-cruiser , in case their crews decided to return them to Vichy France where they might fall into the hands of the Germans. One sailor boarding &quot;Surcouf&quot; was killed during the operation. On the following day, &quot;Revenge&quot; resumed ferrying gold, this time with a cargo worth £47 million, repeating this on 11 August with £14.5 million from Greenock.

On 15 September, &quot;Revenge&quot; arrived in Plymouth where she came under the control of Western Approaches Command, in case of an invasion. If the German amphibious landing, codenamed Operation Sealion, had gone ahead as planned, &quot;Revenge&quot; would have been the only British capital ship in the English Channel area. Unknown to the British high command, Adolf Hitler had ordered that the invasion be postponed indefinitely on 17 September; however in the early hours of 11 October, &quot;Revenge&quot; formed the main element of Operation Medium, which aimed to bombard invasion transport ships and barges that were still concentrated in the French port of Cherbourg. &quot;Revenge&quot;, six destroyers and a screen of motor gun boats formed the striking force, while a covering force of three cruisers and six destroyers patrolled to prevent German naval forces from interfering. There was a simultaneous air raid by RAF Bomber Command which also dropped flares to illuminate the target. During the 18-minute bombardment, &quot;Revenge&quot; fired 120 main-gun shells at the harbour while her escorts fired 801 rounds from their 4.7-inch guns. The British force came under accurate fire from German heavy coastal artillery but were able to retire undamaged, &quot;Revenge&quot; managed to make 21.5 knots on the return journey. On 13 November 1940, she resumed North Atlantic convoy duties, which continued without major incident well into 1941.

====With the Eastern Fleet====
In October 1941, the Admiralty decided the ship was to be transferred to the 3rd Battle Squadron, which was to be based in Colombo, Ceylon; she was joined there by her three surviving sisters ( had been sunk in October 1939). The unit was established in December, with the squadron attached to Force F. With the start of the Pacific War on 7 December, naval forces were necessary in the Indian Ocean to protect British India. By the end of March 1942, the Eastern Fleet had been formed, under the command of Admiral James Somerville. Despite the numerical strength of the Eastern Fleet, many of its units, including the four &quot;Revenge&quot;-class battleships, were no longer front-line warships. Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo&#x27;s powerful &quot;Kido Butai&quot;, composed of six carriers and four fast battleships, was significantly stronger than Somerville&#x27;s Eastern Fleet. As a result, only the modernised battleship could operate with the two fleet carriers; &quot;Revenge&quot;, her three sisters, and the carrier &quot;Hermes&quot; were kept away from combat to escort convoys in the Indian Ocean.

In late March, the code-breakers at the Far East Combined Bureau, a branch of Bletchley Park, informed Somerville that the Japanese were planning a raid into the Indian Ocean to attack Colombo and Trincomalee and destroy his fleet. He therefore divided his fleet into two groups: Force A, which consisted of the two fleet carriers, &quot;Warspite&quot; and four cruisers, and Force B, centred on &quot;Revenge&quot; and her sisters and &quot;Hermes&quot;. He intended to ambush Nagumo&#x27;s fleet in a night action, the only method by which he thought he could achieve a victory. After three days of searching for the Japanese fleet without success, Somerville returned to Addu Atoll to refuel. While refuelling his ships, Somerville received a report that the Japanese fleet was approaching Colombo, which they attacked the following day, on 5 April, followed by attacks on Trincomalee on 9 April. Following the first raid on 5 April, Somerville withdrew &quot;Revenge&quot; and her three sisters to Mombasa, where they could secure the shipping routes in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf. The four &quot;Revenge&quot;s departed from Addu Atoll early on the morning of 9 April, bound for Mombasa; they remained based there into 1943. Thereafter, the &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships escorted convoys while based in Kilindini Harbour. The ship underwent a further refit in Durban from October to November 1942. In February 1943, &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot; escorted the Operation Pamphlet convoy that carried the 9th Australian Division from Egypt back to Australia.

====Fate====
In mid-1943, the poor condition of the ship—which had become apparent as early as 1936, but could not be remedied due to the outbreak of the war—prompted the Admiralty to recall her to Britain to be withdrawn from service. She arrived in the Clyde on 31 September, where she was reduced to reserve status for the rest of the conflict. The ship&#x27;s electrical system was in very poor condition and needed a thorough overhaul, and her hull was badly stressed from years of heavy use. Although in reserve, the ship was used to carry Prime Minister Winston Churchill part of the way to the Tehran Conference in November and December. In January 1944, she was transferred to the Portsmouth Command, based in Southampton; she remained there, out of use, until 17 December, when she was converted into a training ship for boiler room personnel, part of the training establishment . During the period of inactivity, in May 1944, her main armament was removed to provide spare guns for the battleships &quot;Ramillies&quot; and &quot;Warspite&quot;, as well as monitors which were to be vital during the bombardment of the beaches of Normandy during Operation Overlord.

In March 1948, she was placed on the disposal list, being sold for scrap in July to the British Iron &amp; Steel Co.; she was then sent to ship breakers Thos. W. Ward to be broken up at Inverkeithing, where she arrived on 5 September. Some of &quot;Revenge&quot;″s gun-turret rack and pinion gearing was reused in the diameter Mark I radio telescope built at Jodrell Bank, Cheshire, in the mid-1950s, along with equipment from .

<text>HMS &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; (pennant number 05) was a (also known as &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and R-class) battleship of the Royal Navy displacing and armed with eight guns in four twin-gun turrets. She was laid down in January 1914 and launched in April 1915; she was completed in May 1916, but was not ready for service in time to participate in the Battle of Jutland at the end of the month. She served with the Grand Fleet for the remainder of the First World War, but did not see action. In the early 1930s, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and based in Malta.

Unlike the s, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and her sisters were not modernised during the interwar period. Only minor alterations to her anti-aircraft battery were effected before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. Assigned to the Home Fleet, the ship was tasked with convoy protection until May 1940, when she returned to the Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was present during the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, but her slow speed prevented her from engaging the Italian battleships. By March 1942, she was assigned to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean, but after the Indian Ocean raid by Admiral Nagumo&#x27;s &quot;Kido Butai&quot;, the ship was withdrawn to eastern Africa to escort convoys. In January 1944, she returned to Britain, and in May the Royal Navy transferred &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; to the Soviet Navy, which renamed her Arkhangelsk. She then escorted Arctic convoys into Kola until the end of the war. The Soviets returned the ship in 1949, after which she was broken up for scrap.

==Description==
&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; had a length overall of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She had a designed displacement of and displaced at deep load. She was powered by four Parsons steam turbines using steam from eighteen oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and a top speed of . She had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 1,240 officers and ratings in 1921. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; cost £2,570,504 upon completion.

===Armament===
The ship was equipped with eight breech-loading (BL) Mk I guns in four twin gun turrets, in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Twelve of the fourteen BL Mk XII guns were mounted in casemates along the broadside of the vessel amidships; the remaining pair were mounted on the shelter deck and were protected by gun shields. Her anti-aircraft armament consisted of two quick-firing (QF) 20 cwt Mk I AA guns.

In August–September 1924, the 3-inch guns were replaced by a pair of QF Mk V guns. During the ship&#x27;s 1927–28 refit, the shelter deck 6-inch guns were removed and another pair of 4-inch AA guns were added. These were replaced by eight QF 4-inch Mk XVI guns in twin turrets during &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;″s 1937–1938 refit. A pair of eight-barrel 2-pounder &quot;pom-poms&quot; were added in 1932 abreast the funnel, and two four-barrel &quot;pom-poms&quot; were added in early 1942 atop &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets. Ten 20 mm Oerlikon guns were also added in 1941. Another six were added in 1943. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was initially equipped with four submerged torpedo tubes on her broadside, though the after pair were removed in 1932. The forward pair were also removed in 1937–1938, during the ship&#x27;s last prewar refit.

===Fire control===
&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was completed with two fire-control directors fitted with rangefinders. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and the other was in the spotting top above the tripod foremast. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by &#x27;X&#x27; turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in March 1917. A rangefinder replaced the smaller one originally fitted in &#x27;X&#x27; turret in 1919. Similarly, another large rangefinder was fitted in &#x27;B&#x27; turret during the ship&#x27;s 1921–1922 refit. A simple high-angle rangefinder was added above the bridge during that same refit.

About 1931, a High-Angle Control System (HACS) Mk I director replaced the high-angle rangefinder on the spotting top. During the 1932 refit two positions for 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft directors were added on new platforms abreast and below the fire-control director in the spotting top. In the 1937–1938 refit a HACS Mark III director replaced the Mk I in the spotting top and another was added to the torpedo-control tower aft. By 1942, a Type 279 air warning radar, a Type 273 surface-search radar, a Type 284 gunnery radar and two Type 285 anti-aircraft gunnery radars were installed. By September 1943, the Type 284 radar had been replaced by an improved Type 284B and two Type 282 radars had been fitted for the &quot;pom-poms&quot;.

===Protection===
&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;″s waterline belt consisted of face-hardened Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick between &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; barbettes and thinned to 4 to 6 inches (102 to 152 mm) towards the ship&#x27;s ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. Above this was a strake of armour 6 inches thick that extended between &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; barbettes. Transverse bulkheads 4 to 6 inches thick ran at an angle from the ends of the thickest part of the waterline belt to &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; barbettes.

The gun turrets were protected by of KC armour, except for the turret roofs which were thick. The barbettes ranged in thickness from above the upper deck, but were only 4 to 6 inches thick below it. The &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from in thickness. The main conning tower had 13 inches of armour on the sides with a roof. The torpedo control tower in the rear superstructure had 6 inches of armour protecting it. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the magazines and additional anti-flash equipment was added in the magazines. In 1918 the gun shields for the upper deck 6-inch guns were replaced by armoured casemates.

To protect against underwater explosions, the ship was fitted with longitudinal torpedo bulkheads 1 to inches thick that ran from the forward to the rear magazines. During her 1921 refit, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was fitted with an anti-torpedo bulge that ran the length of the ship between the fore and aft barbettes. It was divided into a water-tight empty lower compartment and an upper compartment filled with water-tight &quot;crushing tubes&quot; intended to absorb and distribute the force of an explosion. The space between the tubes was filled with wood and cement.

===Aircraft===
The ship was fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. In 1932 the platforms were removed from the turrets and a trainable catapult was installed on her quarterdeck, along with a crane to recover a seaplane. The catapult and crane were removed by March 1937.

==Service history==
===First World War===
&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was laid down on 15 January 1914 at the HM Dockyard, Portsmouth. The ship was launched on 29 April 1915 and commissioned in May 1916. On 30 May 1916, three weeks after her commissioning, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was present in Scapa Flow when the fleet commander, Admiral John Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to sea. Jellicoe purposely left &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; behind in port due to the inexperience of her crew; causing her to miss the Battle of Jutland the following day. In the months after the engagement, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was quickly made ready for service with the fleet to further increase the numerical superiority of the Grand Fleet over the German High Seas Fleet.

The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August 1916 to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes during the action of 19 August prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.

In April 1918, the High Seas Fleet again sortied, to attack British convoys to Norway. They enforced strict wireless silence during the operation, which prevented Room 40 cryptanalysts from warning the new commander of the Grand Fleet, Admiral David Beatty. The British learned of the operation only after an accident aboard the battlecruiser forced her to break radio silence to inform the German commander of her condition. Beatty then ordered the Grand Fleet to sea to intercept the Germans, but he was not able to reach the High Seas Fleet before it turned back for Germany. This was the last time &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet would go to sea for the remainder of the war. On 21 November 1918, following the Armistice, the entire Grand Fleet left port to escort the surrendered German fleet into internment at Scapa Flow.

===Inter-war period===
The Royal Marines detachment assigned to &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; left the ship on 21 June 1919 to conduct exercises. The ship meanwhile went into drydock at Invergordon in September. Post-war demobilisation in 1919 saw some 500 men leave the ship while she was in dock. Upon returning to service in late 1919, the ship was assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. Conflicts between Greece and the crumbling Ottoman Empire prompted the Royal Navy to deploy a force to the eastern Mediterranean. In April 1920, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and her sister ship steamed to the region via Malta. While in the Ottoman capital Constantinople, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and the other British warships took on White émigrés fleeing the Communist Red Army. Among those refugees aboard &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was a princess of the Galitzine family.

The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty cut the battleship strength of the Royal Navy from forty ships to fifteen. The remaining active battleships were divided between the Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleets and conducted joint operations annually. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; remained with the Atlantic Fleet through 1926. On 4 October 1927, the ship was placed in reserve to effect a major refit. Four new rangefinders and eight searchlights were installed. On 15 May 1929, the refit was finished, and the ship was assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. The squadron consisted of &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, her sisters &quot;Resolution&quot; and , and , and based in Malta. By the 1930s, the five ships of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class were rotated through extensive modernisation. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and her sisters, however, were smaller and slower than the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class, and so they were not extensively modernised in the inter-war period. The only changes made were augmentations to their anti-aircraft batteries.

Fleet exercises in 1934 were carried out in the Bay of Biscay, followed by a fleet regatta in Navarino Bay off Greece. In 1935, the ship returned to Britain for the Jubilee Fleet Review for King George V. In August 1935, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was transferred to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, where she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Charles Ramsey. The ship served as a training vessel until 2 June 1937, when she was again placed in reserve for a major overhaul. This lasted until 18 February 1938, after which she returned to the 2nd Battle Squadron. In 1939, King George VI made a state visit to Canada; &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and the rest of the fleet escorted his ship halfway across the Atlantic and met it on the return leg of the voyage.

In early 1939, the Admiralty considered plans to send &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and her four sisters to Asia to counter Japanese expansionism. They reasoned that the then established &quot;Singapore strategy&quot;, which called for a fleet to be formed in Britain to be dispatched to confront a Japanese attack was inherently risky due to the long delay. They argued that a dedicated battle fleet would allow for faster reaction. The plan was abandoned, however, because the new s would not begin to enter service until 1941. In the last weeks of August 1939, the Royal Navy began to concentrate in wartime bases as tensions with Germany rose. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; steamed to Invergordon, where she joined her sisters &quot;Resolution&quot; and , , and the battlecruiser . By 31 August, the force joined , the flagship of Admiral Charles Forbes, the commander of the Home Fleet.

===Second World War===

On 31 August, the day before the German invasion of Poland, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was assigned to a screening force in the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap to patrol for German merchant ships that might be attempting to reach Germany. At the outset of war in September 1939, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Home Fleet. She was assigned to the North Atlantic Escort Force, which was based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and was tasked with protecting convoys to Britain. Upon returning to Plymouth, she underwent a short refit. In May 1940, she moved to the Mediterranean Fleet. There she was based in Alexandria with the battleships , &quot;Malaya&quot;, and , under the command of Admiral Andrew Cunningham. On 25–27 June, she and her sister ship escorted two convoys from Alexandria to Malta. On 28 June, aerial reconnaissance located Italian destroyers off Zakynthos; Admiral John Tovey took the 7th Cruiser Squadron. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was left behind due to her slow speed. Cunningham split his fleet into three groups; &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and &quot;Malaya&quot; were the core of Group C. She was present at the Battle of Calabria on 18 July, but her slow speed prevented her from engaging the Italian battleships. &quot;Warspite&quot; bore the brunt of the action, as &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and &quot;Malaya&quot; lagged behind.

In mid-August 1940, while steaming in the Red Sea, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was unsuccessfully attacked by the . Later that month, she returned to Atlantic convoy duties. These lasted until August 1941, when periodic maintenance was effected in Norfolk, Virginia. The Admiralty decided in May 1941 to deploy a powerful fleet to be based in Singapore to counter any Japanese attempt to invade Western colonies in Southeast Asia. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and her sisters &quot;Revenge&quot;, &quot;Ramillies&quot;, and &quot;Resolution&quot; were assigned to the force. The unit was to have been assembled in Singapore by March 1942, though &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; reached the theatre earlier. At the beginning of March 1942, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, the heavy cruiser , and several smaller vessels escorted the convoy SU.1 of twelve troopships transporting 10,090 soldiers. The convoy departed Colombo on 1 March, bound for Australia. The convoy reached Fremantle without incident on 15 March.
By the end of March 1942, the Eastern Fleet had been formed, under the command of Admiral James Somerville. The fleet was centred on a pair of fleet aircraft carriers, the elderly carrier , and five battleships, four of which were &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and her sisters; the fifth was &quot;Warspite&quot;. The fleet also included seven cruisers and sixteen destroyers. Despite the numerical strength of the Eastern Fleet, many of its units, including the four &quot;Revenge&quot;-class battleships, were no longer front-line warships. Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo&#x27;s powerful &quot;Kido Butai&quot;, composed of six carriers and four fast battleships, was significantly stronger than Somerville&#x27;s Eastern Fleet. As a result, only the modernised &quot;Warspite&quot; could operate with the two fleet carriers; &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, her three sisters, and &quot;Hermes&quot; were kept away from combat to escort convoys in the Indian Ocean.

In late March, the code-breakers at the Far East Combined Bureau, a branch of Bletchley Park, informed Somerville that the Japanese were planning a raid into the Indian Ocean to attack Colombo and Trincomalee and destroy his fleet. He therefore divided his fleet into two groups: Force A, which consisted of the two fleet carriers, &quot;Warspite&quot; and four cruisers, and Force B, centred on &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and her sisters and the carrier &quot;Hermes&quot;. He intended to ambush Nagumo&#x27;s fleet in a night action, the only method by which he thought he could achieve a victory. After three days of searching for the Japanese fleet without success, Somerville returned to Addu Atoll to refuel. While refuelling his ships, Somerville received a report that the Japanese fleet was approaching Colombo, which they attacked the following day, on 5 April, followed by attacks on Trincomalee on 9 April.

Following the raid in April 1942, Somerville withdrew &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and her three sisters to Mombasa, where they could secure the shipping routes in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and her sisters departed from Addu Atoll early on the morning on 9 April, bound for Mombasa. Here they remained stationed until September 1943, with the exception of another long period in the dockyard in Philadelphia in late 1942. While &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was moored in Philadelphia, the American light cruiser , a badly-damaged veteran of the Battle of Cape Esperance, shared a pier with her. During the refit, the ship&#x27;s deck armour was increased by and four of her six-inch guns were removed. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was sent back to the United States for a major overhaul in Philadelphia, from March to September 1943. She then returned to the Indian Ocean to resume her patrol duties. In January 1944, she left the Indian Ocean, bound for Britain.

====Service with the Soviet Navy====

After returning to Britain, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was sent to the naval base in Scapa Flow. On 30 May 1944 she was transferred on loan to the Soviet Navy as &quot;Arkhangelsk&quot; in lieu of war reparations from Italy, as there was concerns about mutiny from sailors in the newly allied country. The ship left Britain on 17 August 1944 as part of the escort for Convoy JW 59, which contained thirty-three merchant vessels. Six days later, while still en route, the convoy was attacked by the U-boat . The submarine&#x27;s captain, Hans-Günther Lange, incorrectly reported hits on &quot;Arkhangelsk&quot; and a destroyer, though his torpedoes had exploded prematurely. Under the impression that they had crippled the battleship, the Germans launched several submarine attacks on the ship while she was moored in Kola. Anti-torpedo nets ensured that the attacks failed, however. The Germans then planned to use six &quot;Biber&quot; midget submarines to attack the ship, but mechanical difficulties eventually forced the cancellation of the plan. Regardless, &quot;Arkhangelsk&quot; had already departed Kola to patrol the White Sea by the time the &quot;Biber&quot;s would have arrived. A Soviet crew commissioned the ship on 29 August 1944 at Polyarny. &quot;Arkhangelsk&quot; was the largest ship in the Soviet fleet during the war. While in Soviet service, she was the flagship of Admiral Gordey Levchenko and was tasked with meeting Allied convoys in the Arctic Ocean and escorting them into Kola. The ship itself was poorly winterized before its transfer to the Soviet Navy, and it lacked shipwide heating systems as well as turret lubricants suited for the conditions of the Arctic convoys.

&quot;Arkhangelsk&quot; ran aground in the White Sea in late 1947; the extent of damage, if any, is unknown. The Soviet Navy returned the ship to the Royal Navy on 4 February 1949 after the former was transferred to the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. The Soviet Navy – intending to keep the vessel – had initially sought to avoid sending the ship back, claiming that she was not sufficiently seaworthy to make the voyage back to Britain. After an inspection by a Royal Navy officer, however, the Soviet Navy agreed to return the vessel in January 1949. Upon returning to the Rosyth naval base, Royal Navy personnel thoroughly inspected the ship and found much of her equipment to be unserviceable. It appeared to the inspectors that the main battery turrets had not been rotated while the ship was in Soviet service, and were jammed on the centreline. She was sold for scrap, the last member of her class to suffer this fate. The ship arrived at Thos. W. Ward&#x27;s scrapyard at Inverkeithing, Scotland, on 18 May to be broken up. The elevation mechanisms from her main battery gun turrets were later reused in the Mark I radio telescope at Jodrell Bank, Cheshire built in 1955–1957.

<text>HMS &quot;Resolution&quot; (pennant number: 09) was one of five s built for the Royal Navy during the First World War. Completed in December 1916, &quot;Resolution&quot; saw no combat during the war as both the British and German fleets adopted a more cautious strategy after the Battle of Jutland in May owing to the increasing threat of naval mines and submarines.

&quot;Resolution&quot; spent the 1920s and 1930s alternating between the Atlantic Fleet and the Mediterranean Fleet. Whilst serving in the Mediterranean in the early 1920s, the ship went to Turkey twice in response to crises arising from the Greco-Turkish War, including the Great Fire of Smyrna in 1922. She also saw limited involvement during the Franco-British intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea in 1920. The ship&#x27;s interwar career was otherwise uneventful. With the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, &quot;Resolution&quot; was assigned to the Channel Force before being transferred to convoy escort duties in the North Atlantic. In May 1940, she participated in the Battles of Narvik until German air attacks drove her off.

In June 1940, the ship was transferred to Force H, where she took part in the destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir in July after the French surrender to Germany. She was also involved in the Battle of Dakar, an attempt to neutralise the French battleship that ended with &quot;Resolution&quot;″s torpedoing by the French submarine . Badly damaged, &quot;Resolution&quot; was repaired first in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and then the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard under Lend-Lease. Thereafter assigned to the Eastern Fleet, her age kept her from seeing action against the Japanese fleet, and she instead escorted convoys off the eastern coast of Africa. She returned to Britain in September 1943 and was decommissioned. Thereafter she saw service with the training establishment , a role she filled until February 1948, when she was paid off, sold for scrap and broken up at Faslane.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Revenge&quot;-class super-dreadnought battleships were designed as slightly smaller, slower, and more heavily protected versions of the preceding s. As an economy measure they were intended to revert to the previous practice of using both fuel oil and coal, but First Sea Lord Jackie Fisher rescinded the decision for coal in October 1914. Still under construction, the ships were redesigned to employ oil-fired boilers that increased the power of the engines by over the original specification.
&quot;Resolution&quot; had a length overall of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She had a designed displacement of and displaced at deep load. She was powered by two pairs of Parsons steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam from eighteen Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at and intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During her sea trials on 22 May 1916, the ship only reached a top speed of from . She had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 910 officers and ratings in 1916. Her metacentric height was at deep load.

The &quot;Revenge&quot; class was equipped with eight breech-loading (BL) Mk I guns in four twin gun turrets, in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Twelve of the fourteen BL Mk XII guns were mounted singly in casemates along the broadside of the vessel amidships; the remaining pair were mounted on the shelter deck and were protected by gun shields. The ship also mounted four 3-pounder () guns. Her anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of two quick-firing (QF) 20 cwt Mk I guns. She was fitted with four submerged 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, two on each broadside.

&quot;Resolution&quot; was completed with two fire-control directors fitted with rangefinders. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and the other was in the spotting top above the tripod foremast. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by &#x27;X&#x27; turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in April 1917. A torpedo-control director with a 15-foot rangefinder was mounted at the aft end of the superstructure.

The ship&#x27;s waterline belt consisted of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick between &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; barbettes and thinned to 4 to 6 inches (102 to 152 mm) towards the ship&#x27;s ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. Above this was a strake of armour 6 inches thick that extended between &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; barbettes. Transverse bulkheads 4 to 6 inches thick ran at an angle from the ends of the thickest part of the waterline belt to &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; barbettes. The gun turrets were protected by of KC armour, except for the turret roofs which were thick. The barbettes ranged in thickness from above the upper deck, but were only 4 to 6 inches thick below it. The &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from in thickness. The main conning tower had 13 inches of armour on the sides with a 3-inch roof. The torpedo director in the rear superstructure had 6 inches of armour protecting it. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the magazines and additional anti-flash equipment was added in the magazines.

The ship was fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. In 1927 a rotating aircraft catapult was installed on &quot;Resolution&quot;″s quarterdeck. It was removed during her 1929–1931 refit. The flying-off platforms were removed in 1932–1933. A catapult was added on the roof of &#x27;X&#x27; turret by September 1936 as well as a crane to handle the aircraft.

===Major alterations===
&quot;Resolution&quot; was fitted with anti-torpedo bulges between late 1917 and May 1918. They were designed to reduce the effect of torpedo detonations and improve stability. They increased her beam by over 13 feet (4 m) to , her displacement to and reduced her draught to , all at deep load. They increased her metacentric height to . Later in 1918, a rangefinder was fitted in &#x27;B&#x27; turret.

The gun shields for the shelter-deck six-inch guns were replaced by armoured casemates in 1922. Two years later, her anti-aircraft defences were upgraded by replacing the original three-inch AA guns with a pair of QF AA guns. Another pair of four-inch AA guns were added and the six-inch guns from the shelter deck were removed in 1927. During the ship&#x27;s 1929–31 refit, a High-Angle Control System (HACS) Mk I director was installed on the spotting top and the aft pair of torpedo tubes on either side were also removed. An experimental 4-inch dual-purpose, twin-gun turret was installed in the place of the starboard forward AA gun for evaluation.

By September 1933 a pair of quadruple mounts for Vickers .50 machine guns were added abreast the conning tower. Three years later a HACS Mk II director replaced the Mk I on the roof of the spotting top. A platform for another director was added on the mainmast which was converted into a tripod to handle the additional weight. The torpedo director and its associated rangefinder were removed. In January 1938 the rear HACS was added, the existing AA guns were replaced with QF 4-inch Mk XVI guns in Mk XIX twin mounts and a pair of octuple mounts for two-pounder Mk VIII &quot;pom-pom&quot; guns were added with their directors. The forward pair of submerged torpedo tubes were also removed.

Wartime modifications for the &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships were fairly minimal. In 1941 &quot;Resolution&quot; was fitted with a Type 279 early-warning radar and a pair of Type 285 anti-aircraft gunnery sets. The following year a Type 273 surface-search radar and a pair of Type 284 gunnery radars for the main guns were added. The quadruple .50-calibre mounts were replaced by nine 20 mm Oerlikons in September 1941. Two four-barrel &quot;pom-poms&quot; were added as in 1942 as well as another Oerlikon. To save weight and make more room available for the additional crew required to man the new equipment like the radars and Oerlikons, two 6-inch guns were removed in 1943.

==Construction and service==
===First World War===

&quot;Resolution&quot; was laid down at Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, Jarrow on 29 November 1913, launched on 14 January 1915, and commissioned on 7 December 1916. On 30 December, she joined the Grand Fleet in Rosyth, assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron along with her sister ships and several other battleships. After the action of 19 August 1916, in which the Grand Fleet had lost two light cruisers to German U-boat attacks, Admiral John Jellicoe, the fleet commander, decided that the fleet should not be risked in further such sorties unless the German High Seas Fleet ventured north or the strategic situation warranted the risk. For its part, the German fleet remained in port or trained in the Baltic Sea through 1917, as both sides had largely abandoned the idea of a decisive surface battle in the North Sea. Both sides turned to positional warfare, laying fields of naval mines, and Germany resumed the unrestricted submarine warfare campaign early in the year. As a result, &quot;Resolution&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet saw no action during this period.

In 1917, Britain began running regular convoys to Norway, escorted by light forces; the Germans raided these convoys twice late in the year, prompting Admiral David Beatty, who had replaced Jellicoe the previous year, to send battle squadrons of the Grand Fleet to escort the convoys. The High Seas Fleet went to sea on 23 April to attack one of the escorted convoys, but after the battlecruiser suffered a serious mechanical accident the next day, the Germans were forced to break off the operation. &quot;Resolution&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet sortied on 24 April once they intercepted wireless signals from the damaged &quot;Moltke&quot;, but the Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. On 21 November 1918, following the Armistice, the entire Grand Fleet left port to escort the surrendered German fleet into internment at Scapa Flow.

===Interwar years===
Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, &quot;Resolution&quot; typically operated with her sister ships, apart from periods where they were detached for refit or modernisation. In April 1919, the ships were transferred to the Atlantic Fleet, still as part of the 1st Battle Squadron. They were then attached to the Mediterranean Fleet for operations in Turkey and the Black Sea as part of Britain&#x27;s responses to the Greco-Turkish War and the Russian Civil War, respectively. On 10 April, the ship arrived in Constantinople from Malta, and two days later she and several other ships went to Prinkipo to conduct gunnery training. &quot;Resolution&quot; then went to Batumi in southern Russia, where she remained until mid-June, when she steamed back across the Black Sea to Constantinople, arriving on 18 June. The ship was then stationed in Chanak, along with her sister and the light cruiser . The two battleships embarked passengers and casualties bound for Britain before sailing for home waters, in company with a pair of destroyers.

In August 1920, the ships returned to the Atlantic Fleet. The 1st and 2nd Battle Squadrons merged in May 1921, with the &quot;Resolution&quot; and her four sisters forming the 1st Division and the five &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class battleships forming the 2nd Division. &quot;Resolution&quot; and three of her sisters were again sent to the Mediterranean Fleet in September 1922 during a crisis in Smyrna that culminated in the Great fire of Smyrna as the Greco-Turkish War came to its conclusion. The ships primarily operated in the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmora, though &quot;Resolution&quot; also stopped in Mytilene and Smyrna in February 1923 in company with the battleship and several cruisers and destroyers. With the war over by November, the ships were free to return once again to the Atlantic Fleet.

On 10 January 1924, while conducting training exercises in the English Channel, &quot;Resolution&quot; ran into and sank the British submarine as she was surfacing, damaging her bow in the collision. Crewmen aboard &quot;Resolution&quot; reported feeling a shock at 11:13, but they were unaware that they had struck the submarine; it became clear later that day when the fleet returned to port and &quot;L24&quot; was found to be missing. The submarine was sunk with the loss of all hands. From July to October, &quot;Resolution&quot; underwent a refit. On 1 November, the Atlantic Fleet underwent a reorganisation that saw the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class ships sent to the Mediterranean Fleet and the ships of the 1st Division reconstituted as the 1st Battle Squadron. The ship underwent another, more lengthy refit from December 1926 to December 1927. &quot;Resolution&quot; and her sisters were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in August 1927.

In early 1935, the &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; classes again swapped places, though by this time, the Atlantic Fleet had been renamed the Home Fleet. On 16 July, the ships were present during the fleet review at Spithead for King George V&#x27;s silver jubilee. In December, &quot;Resolution&quot; again went into drydock for a refit that lasted until September 1936. She and her sisters were again present for the Coronation Review for George VI on 20 May 1937. In the last weeks of August 1939, the Royal Navy began to concentrate in wartime bases as tensions with Germany rose. &quot;Resolution&quot; steamed to Invergordon, where she joined her sisters &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, , and the battlecruiser . By 31 August, the force joined , the flagship of Admiral Charles Forbes, the commander of the Home Fleet.

===Second World War===

In September 1939, immediately after the start of the Second World War, &quot;Resolution&quot; was assigned to the Channel Force, based in Portland. On 1 October, after the German heavy cruiser sank the merchant vessel , the Admiralty ordered &quot;Resolution&quot; to join the South Atlantic Command, but rescinded the order four days later. &quot;Resolution&quot; was instead sent to the North Atlantic Escort Force in company with . She carried a load of gold bullion to Canada to safeguard it during the war, and thereafter escorted convoys of troopships from Canada to Britain through December 1939. She escorted the first major troop convoy starting on 12 December, in company with the battlecruiser . The Royal Navy purchased the merchant ship in September and disguised her as &quot;Resolution&quot; to deceive German aircraft while the battleship was on patrol in the Atlantic, a role she filled until February 1942.

In April 1940, &quot;Resolution&quot; re-joined the Home Fleet during the campaign in Norway. She was sent to relieve the battleship off Narvik late that month, arriving on 26 April. The ship and the light cruiser bombarded German positions around Beisfjord on 1 May. She supported the landing at Bjerkvik on 13 May during the Battles of Narvik. She arrived off Bjerkvik late on 12 May as part of a force that included two cruisers and five destroyers; they made preparations for the attack, which began in the early hours of the following morning. She carried five tanks and other vehicles for the landing, which she hoisted out in the darkness. Three of the tanks were sent in first, and as the German defenders engaged the incoming amphibious assault, &quot;Resolution&quot; and the cruisers and destroyers shelled German defences in the area. As the men and tanks fought their way inland, the ships conducted a creeping barrage. By 06:00, the troops had secured the town and signaled that &quot;Resolution&quot; and the rest of the squadron could depart. Later in May she was attacked by German Junkers Ju 88 bombers; she was hit by one bomb that killed two men and wounded another twenty-seven. On 18 May, she was detached to return to Scapa Flow to prevent her from being damaged by further air attacks.

====Forces H and M====

On 4 June, &quot;Resolution&quot; departed Scapa Flow bound for Gibraltar, where she joined Force H, which also included the battlecruiser and the battleship . She took part in the destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir on 3 July 1940. Following the French surrender on 22 June, the French fleet was to be disarmed under German and Italian supervision. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralise the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, surrender for internment, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum; the French rejected it, and so the British ships opened fire. Shell hits from &quot;Resolution&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot;, and &quot;Hood&quot; struck the French battleship , destroying her in a magazine explosion, and forced the battleship to run herself aground to avoid sinking. The battleship also sank in shallow water, though she was later refloated.

With the fleet at Mers-el-Kebir neutralised, the naval forces at Dakar became the next target for Force H. The nearly-completed battleship , which had fled from Brest, France to escape the advancing German army, was in Dakar and was to be attacked on 6 July. However, Somerville was ordered to return to Mers-el-Kebir to ensure that &quot;Dunkerque&quot; was in fact destroyed—the attacks carried out by &quot;Hood&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot;, and &quot;Ark Royal&quot;—granting &quot;Richelieu&quot; a temporary reprieve. Force H, again including &quot;Resolution&quot;, was then sent on 8 July to divert the attention of the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (Royal Navy) while a Malta convoy steamed to the island. During the operation, the ships made a feint toward Sardinia and &quot;Ark Royal&quot; launched a raid on Cagliari. Force H next supported Operation Hurry in late July and early August. Following the operation, &quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;Ark Royal&quot; were detached from Force H to finally conduct the attack on &quot;Richelieu&quot;. The ships joined the battleship , three cruisers, and ten destroyers as Force M, under the command of Admiral Andrew Cunningham.

On the morning of 23 September, Force M appeared off Dakar and Cunningham issued the French commander the same ultimatum as at Mers-el-Kebir. After the French again refused to surrender or scuttle their ship and began firing on the British fleet, the British ships returned fire, and in the course of about half an hour, &quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;Barham&quot; had fired more than 100 shells from their main battery. Poor visibility hampered their shooting, and between them the two battleships only scored a single hit on a freighter. Unable to effectively engage the French forces in the harbour, Cunningham broke off the attack after several of his ships received serious hits from French coastal batteries. The next day, Cunningham attempted an air strike from &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, which failed to damage the heavily armoured &quot;Richelieu&quot;. While they were steaming off the coast, the destroyer came under attack from a French cruiser, which &quot;Resolution&quot; drove off with a single broadside of her main battery guns. The battleships then moved into position to attack the port; they scored a single hit on &quot;Richelieu&quot;, though it was only a splinter from a 15-inch shell that did little damage. &quot;Resolution&quot;″s fire director gear broke down ten minutes into the action, drastically reducing her ability to fire accurately. The British briefly withdrew before attacking again later in the afternoon; &quot;Resolution&quot; engaged the shore battery while &quot;Barham&quot; fired on &quot;Richelieu&quot;. Neither British ship scored any hits, though &quot;Resolution&quot; was straddled by the coastal guns. Cunningham again disengaged, determined to make another attack the next morning.

The two battleships arrived off Dakar at around 9:00 to launch another attack, this time supported by a pair of heavy cruisers. Just as they were manoeuvring into position, the French submarine launched a spread of torpedoes at the battleships, one of which struck &quot;Resolution&quot; amidships on her port side. The explosion tore a large hole in her hull and flooded the port boiler room, reducing her to a speed of and causing a serious list to port. &quot;Resolution&quot; was forced to withdraw, leaving &quot;Barham&quot; to engage &quot;Richelieu&quot; by herself. Cunningham escorted the crippled battleship to Freetown for repairs, and the next morning, &quot;Barham&quot; had to take her under tow. The ships arrived in Freetown on 29 September, where &quot;Resolution&quot; underwent six months of repairs. She returned to Portsmouth in March 1941, where she came under a German air attack that failed to score any hits. &quot;Resolution&quot; then crossed the Atlantic to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, where she underwent repairs and modernisation under Lend-Lease; the modifications included altering her main battery turrets to allow elevation to 30 degrees, significantly increasing her range. Work completed in September 1941, allowing &quot;Resolution&quot; to return to action.

====Eastern Fleet====
In early 1942, the Royal Navy began amassing forces to send to the Indian Ocean to defend British India after the start of the Pacific War in December 1941. The ship sailed for Cape Town, where she met the aircraft carrier ; they were later joined by &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Warspite&quot;, and on arriving in the Indian Ocean, they rendezvoused with the carriers and the small and obsolescent . By the end of March 1942, the Eastern Fleet had been formed, under the command of Admiral Somerville. Despite the numerical strength of the Eastern Fleet, many of its units, including the four &quot;Revenge&quot;-class battleships, were no longer front-line warships. Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo&#x27;s powerful &quot;Kido Butai&quot;, composed of six carriers and four fast battleships, was significantly stronger than Somerville&#x27;s Eastern Fleet. As a result, only the modernised &quot;Warspite&quot; could operate with the two fleet carriers; &quot;Resolution&quot;, her three sisters, and &quot;Hermes&quot; were kept away from combat to escort convoys in the Indian Ocean.

In late March, the code-breakers at the Far East Combined Bureau, a branch of Bletchley Park, informed Somerville that the Japanese were planning a raid into the Indian Ocean to attack Colombo and Trincomalee and destroy his fleet. He therefore divided his fleet into two groups: Force A, which consisted of the two fleet carriers, &quot;Warspite&quot; and four cruisers, and Force B, centred on &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and her sisters and the carrier &quot;Hermes&quot;. He intended to ambush Nagumo&#x27;s fleet in a night action, the only method by which he thought he could achieve a victory. After three days of searching for the Japanese fleet without success, Somerville returned to Addu Atoll to refuel. While refuelling his ships, Somerville received a report that the Japanese fleet was approaching Colombo, which they attacked the following day, on 5 April, followed by attacks on Trincomalee on 9 April. Following the first raid on 5 April, Somerville withdrew &quot;Resolution&quot; and her three sisters to Mombasa, where they could secure the shipping routes in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf. The four &quot;Revenge&quot;s departed from Addu Atoll early on the morning on 9 April, bound for Mombasa; they remained based there into 1943. In February 1943, &quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;Revenge&quot; escorted the Operation Pamphlet convoy that carried the 9th Australian Division from Egypt back to Australia.

====Later career====

In September, &quot;Resolution&quot; returned to Britain, where she underwent a refit. She was reduced to the reserves in October, and in 1944 was assigned to the training establishment . She was disarmed, her main battery guns being used as spares for &quot;Warspite&quot; and , which were being used for coastal bombardment in support of the Normandy landings at the time. &quot;Resolution&quot; served as a training ship for the next four years before being paid off in February 1948. She was then placed on the disposal list and sold to the British Iron and Steel Co., who sent the vessel to Metal Industries Ltd. in Faslane to be broken up, arriving there on 13 May. One of &quot;Resolution&quot;″s 15-inch guns, which was later fitted to the monitor , is on display at the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>HMS &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was one of five s built for the Royal Navy during the First World War. Completed in 1916, the ship first saw combat at the Battle of Jutland as part of the Grand Fleet. In peacetime, she served in the Atlantic, Home and Mediterranean fleets, more than once coming under accidental attack. &quot;Royal Oak&quot; drew worldwide attention in 1928 when her senior officers were controversially court-martialled, an event that brought considerable embarrassment to what was then the world&#x27;s largest navy. Attempts to modernise &quot;Royal Oak&quot; throughout her 25-year career could not fix her fundamental lack of speed and, by the start of the Second World War, she was no longer suitable for front-line duty.

On 14 October 1939, &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was anchored at Scapa Flow in Orkney, Scotland, when she was torpedoed by the German submarine . Of &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s complement of 1,234 men and boys, 835 were killed that night or died later of their wounds. The loss of the outdated ship—the first of five Royal Navy battleships and battlecruisers sunk in the Second World War—did little to affect the numerical superiority enjoyed by the British navy and its Allies, but it had a considerable effect on wartime morale. The raid made an immediate celebrity and war hero of the U-boat commander, Günther Prien, who became the first German submarine officer to be awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. Before the sinking of &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, the Royal Navy had considered the naval base at Scapa Flow impregnable to submarine attack, but &quot;U-47&quot;″s raid demonstrated that the German navy was capable of bringing the war to British home waters. The shock resulted in rapid changes to dockland security and the construction of the Churchill Barriers around Scapa Flow, with the added advantage of being topped by roads running between the islands.

The wreck of &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, a designated war grave, lies almost upside down in of water with her hull beneath the surface. In an annual ceremony marking the loss of the ship, Royal Navy divers place a White Ensign underwater at her stern. Unauthorised divers are prohibited from approaching the wreck under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

== Design and description ==
The &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships were designed as slightly smaller, slower, and more heavily protected versions of the preceding s. As an economy measure they were intended to revert to the previous practice of using both fuel oil and coal, but First Sea Lord Jackie Fisher rescinded the decision for coal in October 1914. While under construction the ships were redesigned to employ oil-fired boilers that increased the power of the engines by over the original specification.

&quot;Royal Oak&quot; had a length overall of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She had a designed displacement of and displaced at deep load. She was powered by two sets of Parsons steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam from 18 Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at 40,000 shaft horsepower (30,000 kW) and intended to reach a maximum speed of . During her sea trials on 22 May 1916, the ship reached a top speed of only from . She had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 909 officers and ratings in 1916.

The &quot;Revenge&quot; class was equipped with eight breech-loading (BL) Mk I guns in four twin gun turrets, in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Twelve of the fourteen BL Mk XII guns were mounted in casemates along the broadside of the vessel amidships; the remaining pair were mounted on the shelter deck and were protected by gun shields. Their anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of two quick-firing (QF) 20 cwt Mk I guns. The ships were fitted with four submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, two on each broadside.

&quot;Royal Oak&quot; was completed with two fire-control directors fitted with rangefinders. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and the other was in the spotting top above the tripod foremast. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could also be controlled by &#x27;X&#x27; turret. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in March 1917. A torpedo-control director with a 15-foot rangefinder was mounted at the aft end of the superstructure.

The ship&#x27;s waterline belt consisted of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick between &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; barbettes and thinned to towards the ship&#x27;s ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. Above this was a strake of armour 6 inches thick that extended between &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; barbettes. Transverse bulkheads 4 to 6 inches thick ran at an angle from the ends of the thickest part of the waterline belt to &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; barbettes. The gun turrets were protected by of KC armour, except for the turret roofs which were thick. The barbettes ranged in thickness from above the upper deck, but were only 4 to 6 inches thick below it. The &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from in thickness. The main conning tower had 13 inches of armour on the sides with a 3-inch roof. The torpedo director in the rear superstructure had 6 inches of armour protecting it. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the magazines and additional anti-flash equipment was installed in the magazines.

The ship was fitted with flying-off platforms, mounted on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets, in 1918; from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. In 1934 the platforms were removed from the turrets and a catapult was installed on the roof of &#x27;X&#x27; turret, along with a crane to recover a seaplane.

=== Major alterations ===

&quot;Royal Oak&quot; was extensively refitted between 1922 and 1924, when her anti-aircraft defences were upgraded by replacing the original three-inch AA guns with a pair of QF Mk V AA guns. A rangefinder was fitted in &#x27;B&#x27; turret and a simple high-angle rangefinder was added above the bridge. Underwater protection improved by the addition of anti-torpedo bulges. They were designed to reduce the effect of torpedo detonations and improve stability at the cost of widening the ship&#x27;s beam by over . They increased her beam to , reduced her draught to , increased her metacentric height to at deep load, and all the changes to her equipment increased her crew to a total of 1,188. Despite the bulges she was able to reach a speed of . A brief refit in early 1927 saw the addition of two more four-inch AA guns and the removal of the six-inch guns from the shelter deck. About 1931, a High-Angle Control System (HACS) Mk I director replaced the high-angle rangefinder on the spotting top. Two years later, the aft pair of torpedo tubes were removed.

The ship received a final refit between 1934 and 1936, when her deck armour was increased to over the magazines and to over the engine rooms. In addition to a general modernisation of the ship&#x27;s systems, her anti-aircraft defences were strengthened by replacing the single mounts of the AA guns with twin mounts for the QF 4-inch Mark XVI gun and adding a pair of octuple mounts for two-pounder Mk VIII &quot;pom-pom&quot; guns to sponsons abreast the funnel. Two positions for &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft directors were added on new platforms abreast and below the fire-control director in the spotting top. A HACS Mk III director replaced the Mk I in the spotting top and another replaced the torpedo director aft. A pair of quadruple mounts for Vickers .50 machine guns were added abreast the conning tower. The mainmast was reconstructed as a tripod to support the weight of a radio-direction finding office and a second High-Angle Control Station. The forward pair of submerged torpedo tubes were removed and four experimental 21-inch torpedo tubes were added above water forward of &#x27;A&#x27; turret.

&quot;Royal Oak&quot; was laid down at Devonport Royal Dockyard on 15 January 1914. She was launched on 17 November, and after fitting-out was commissioned on 1 May 1916 at a final cost of £2,468,269. Named after the Royal Oak in which Charles II hid following his defeat at the 1651 Battle of Worcester, she was the eighth vessel to bear the name &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, replacing a pre-dreadnought scrapped in 1914. Upon completion &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was assigned to the Third Division of the Fourth Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, under the command of Captain Crawford Maclachlan.

===First World War===
====Battle of Jutland====

In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, 6 light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats, departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear-Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered Admiral John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleettotalling 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisersto sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00 the Grand Fleet approached the scene. Fifteen minutes later, Jellicoe gave the order to turn and deploy the fleet for action.

The German cruiser had become disabled by British shellfire, and both sides concentrated in the area, the Germans trying to protect their cruiser and the British attempting to sink her. At 18:29, &quot;Royal Oak&quot; opened fire on the German cruiser, firing four salvoes from her main guns in quick succession, along with her secondary battery. She scored a hit on &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; aft with her third salvo. In return, &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was straddled by a German salvo at 18:33 but was undamaged. German torpedo boats attempted to reach &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; shortly after 19:00, and at 19:07, &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s secondary guns opened fire on them, believing they were instead trying to launch a torpedo attack. By 19:15, &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s gunners had observed the German battlecruiser squadron and opened fire at the leading vessel, . The gunners overestimated the range initially, but by 19:20 had found the correct distance and scored a pair of hits aft, which did not inflict serious damage. &quot;Derfflinger&quot; then disappeared in the haze, so &quot;Royal Oak&quot; shifted fire to the next battlecruiser, . She scored a hit at 19:27 before &quot;Seydlitz&quot; too was lost in the mist.

While &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was attacking the battlecruisers, a German torpedo boat flotilla launched an attack on the British battleline. &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s secondary guns were the first to open fire, at 19:16, followed quickly by the rest of the British ships. Following the German destroyer attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and &quot;Royal Oak&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its night-time cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. In the course of the battle, &quot;Royal Oak&quot; had fired 38 rounds from her main battery and 84 rounds from her secondary guns.

====Later actions====

Following the battle, &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was reassigned to the First Battle Squadron. On 18 August, the Germans again sortied, this time to bombard Sunderland; Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the German fleet commander, hoped to draw out the British battlecruisers and destroy them. British signals intelligence decrypted German wireless transmissions, allowing Jellicoe enough time to deploy the Grand Fleet in an attempt to engage in a decisive battle. Both sides withdrew after their opponents&#x27; submarines inflicted losses in the action of 19 August 1916: the British cruisers and were both torpedoed and sunk by German U-boats, and the German battleship was damaged by the British submarine . After returning to port, Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and U-boats. In late 1917, the Germans began using destroyers and light cruisers to raid the British convoys to Norway; this forced the British to deploy capital ships to protect the convoys. In April 1918, the German fleet sortied in an attempt to catch one of the isolated British squadrons, though the convoy had already passed safely. The Grand Fleet sortied too late to catch the retreating Germans, although the battlecruiser was torpedoed and badly damaged by the submarine .

On 5 November 1918, in the final week of the First World War, &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was anchored off Burntisland in the Firth of Forth accompanied by the seaplane tender and the light battlecruiser . A sudden Force 10 squall caused &quot;Campania&quot; to drag her anchor, collide with &quot;Royal Oak&quot; and then with &quot;Glorious&quot;. Both capital ships suffered only minor damage, but &quot;Campania&quot; was holed by her initial collision with &quot;Royal Oak&quot;. The ship&#x27;s engine rooms flooded, and she settled by the stern and sank five hours later, without loss of life.

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the Allies interned most of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The fleet consisted of 370 British, American, and French warships. The High Seas Fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Konteradmiral Ludwig von Reuter believed the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. That morning, the Grand Fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training manoeuvres, and while they were away von Reuter issued the order to scuttle the High Seas Fleet.

=== 1920s ===

The peacetime reorganisation of the Royal Navy assigned &quot;Royal Oak&quot; to the Second Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. Modernised by a 1922–24 refit, she was transferred in 1926 to the Mediterranean Fleet, based in Grand Harbour, Malta. In early 1928, this duty saw a notorious incident which the contemporary press dubbed the &quot;Royal Oak Mutiny&quot;. What began as a simple dispute between Rear-Admiral Bernard Collard and &quot;Royal Oak&quot;&#x27;s two senior officers, Captain Kenneth Dewar and Commander , over the band at the ship&#x27;s wardroom dance, descended into a bitter personal feud that spanned several months. Dewar and Daniel accused Collard of &quot;vindictive fault-finding&quot; and openly humiliating and insulting them before their crew; in return, Collard countercharged the two with failing to follow orders and treating him &quot;worse than a midshipman&quot;.

When Dewar and Daniel wrote letters of complaint to Collard&#x27;s superior, Vice-Admiral John Kelly, he immediately passed them on to the Commander-in-Chief Admiral Sir Roger Keyes. On realising that the relationship between the two and their flag admiral had irretrievably broken down, Keyes hurriedly convened a Board of Enquiry, the outcome of which was to remove all three men from their posts and send them back to England. The Board sat on the eve of a major naval exercise, which Keyes was obliged to postpone, causing rumours to fly around the fleet that the &quot;Royal Oak&quot; had experienced a mutiny. The story was picked up by the press worldwide, which described with some hyperbole what became known as &quot;the &quot;Royal Oak&quot; affair&quot;. Public attention reached such proportions as to raise the concerns of the King, who summoned First Lord of the Admiralty William Bridgeman for an explanation.

For their letters of complaint, Dewar and Daniel were controversially charged with writing &quot;subversive documents&quot;. In a pair of highly publicised courts-martial held aboard HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; at Gibraltar, both were found guilty and severely reprimanded, leading Daniel to resign from the Navy. Collard himself was criticised for the excesses of his conduct by the press and in Parliament, and on being denounced by Bridgeman as &quot;unfitted to hold further high command&quot;, was forcibly retired from service. He retreated to private life and never spoke publicly of the incident again. On the retired list, he was promoted from Rear- to Vice-Admiral on 1 April 1931. Daniel attempted a career in journalism – notably a prominent anti-noise campaign, conducted through the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, for whom he worked as correspondent – but this was unsuccessful and, after a number of other jobs, his health deteriorated and he died in South Africa in 1955. Of the three, only Dewar escaped with his career, albeit a damaged one: he remained in the Royal Navy, but in a series of more minor commands. His promotion to rear-admiral took place in the year following the court martial, after which he was forcibly retired.

The scandal proved an embarrassment to the reputation of the Royal Navy, then the world&#x27;s largest, and it was satirised at home and abroad through editorials, cartoons, and even a comic jazz oratorio composed by Erwin Schulhoff. One consequence of the damaging affair was an undertaking from the Admiralty to review the means by which naval officers might bring complaints against the conduct of their superiors.

===1930s===

During the Spanish Civil War, &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was tasked with conducting non-intervention patrols around the Iberian Peninsula. On such a patrol and steaming east of Gibraltar on 2 February 1937, she came under aerial attack by three aircraft of the Republican forces. They dropped three bombs (two of which exploded) within 3 cables (550 m) of the starboard bow, causing no damage. The British chargé d&#x27;affaires protested about the incident to the Republican Government, which admitted its error and apologised for the attack. Later that same month, while stationed off Valencia on 23 February 1937 during an aerial bombardment by the Nationalists, she was accidentally struck by an anti-aircraft shell fired from a Republican position. Five men were injured, including &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s captain, T. B. Drew. On this occasion the British did not protest to the Republicans, deeming the incident &quot;an act of God&quot;.

In May 1937, she and escorted SS &quot;Habana&quot;, an ocean liner carrying thousands of Basque child refugees, to the Southampton Docks. In July, as the war in northern Spain flared up, &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, along with her sister rescued the steamer &quot;Gordonia&quot; when Spanish Nationalist warships attempted to capture her off Santander. She was unable on 14 July to prevent the seizure of the British freighter &quot;Molton&quot; by the Nationalist cruiser while trying to enter Santander. The merchantmen had been engaged in the evacuation of refugees.

This same period saw &quot;Royal Oak&quot; star alongside fourteen other Royal Navy vessels in the 1937 British film melodrama &quot;Our Fighting Navy&quot;, the plot of which centres around a coup in the fictional South American republic of Bianco. The Royal Navy saw the film as a recruitment opportunity and provided warships and extras. &quot;Royal Oak&quot; portrays a rebel battleship &quot;El Mirante&quot;, whose commander forces a British captain (played by Robert Douglas) into choosing between his lover and his duty. The film was poorly received by critics, but gained some redemption through its dramatic scenes of naval action.

In 1938, &quot;Royal Oak&quot; returned to the Home Fleet and was made flagship of the Second Battle Squadron based in Portsmouth. On 24 November 1938, she returned the body of the British-born Queen Maud of Norway, who had died in London, to Oslo for a state funeral, accompanied by her husband King Haakon VII. Paying off in December 1938, &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was recommissioned the following June, and in 1939 embarked on a short training cruise in the English Channel in preparation for another 30-month tour of the Mediterranean, for which her crew were issued tropical uniforms. As hostilities loomed, the battleship was instead dispatched north to Scapa Flow, and was at anchor there when war was declared on 3 September.

=== Second World War ===
The next few weeks of the Phoney War proved uneventful, but in October 1939 &quot;Royal Oak&quot; joined the search for the , which had been ordered into the North Sea as a diversion for the commerce-raiding heavy cruisers and . The search was ultimately fruitless, particularly for &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, whose top speed, by then less than , was inadequate to keep up with the rest of the fleet. On 12 October, &quot;Royal Oak&quot; returned to the defences of Scapa Flow in poor shape, battered by North Atlantic storms. Many of her Carley Floats had been smashed and several of the smaller-calibre guns rendered inoperable through flooding. The mission had underlined the obsolescence of the 25-year-old warship. Concerned that a recent overflight by German reconnaissance aircraft heralded an imminent air attack upon Scapa Flow, Admiral of the Home Fleet Charles Forbes ordered most of the fleet to disperse to safer ports. &quot;Royal Oak&quot; remained behind, her anti-aircraft guns still deemed a useful addition to Scapa&#x27;s otherwise scanty air defences.

== Sinking ==

=== Scapa Flow ===

 Scapa Flow made a near-ideal anchorage. Situated at the centre of the Orkney Islands off the north coast of Scotland, the natural harbour, large enough to contain the entire Grand Fleet, was surrounded by a ring of islands separated by shallow channels subject to fast-racing tides. That U-boats still posed a threat had long been realised, and a series of countermeasures were installed during the early years of the First World War. Blockships were sunk at critical points; and floating booms deployed to block the three widest channels, operated by tugboats to allow the passage of friendly shipping. It was considered possible, but highly unlikely, that a U-boat commander might attempt to race through undetected before the boom was closed. Two submarines unsuccessfully attempted infiltration during the First World War: on 23 November 1914 was rammed twice before running aground with the capture of her crew, and was detected by hydrophone and destroyed with the loss of all hands on 28 October 1918.

Scapa Flow provided the main anchorage for the British Grand Fleet throughout most of the First World War, but in the interwar period this passed to Rosyth, further south in the Firth of Forth. Scapa Flow was reactivated with the advent of the Second World War, becoming a base for the British Home Fleet. Its natural and artificial defences, while still strong, were recognised as in need of improvement, and in the early weeks of the war were in the process of being strengthened by the provision of additional blockships.

=== &quot;Special Operation P&quot;: the raid by &quot;U-47&quot; ===

&quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; Commander of Submarines () Karl Dönitz devised a plan to attack Scapa Flow by submarine within days of the outbreak of war. Its goal would be twofold: first, displacing the Home Fleet from Scapa Flow would slacken the British North Sea blockade and grant Germany greater freedom to attack the Atlantic convoys; second, the blow would be a symbolic act of vengeance, striking at the same location where the German High Seas Fleet had scuttled itself following Germany&#x27;s defeat in the First World War. Dönitz hand-picked &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Günther Prien for the task, scheduling the raid for the night of 13/14 October 1939, when the tides would be high and the night moonless.

Dönitz was aided by high-quality photographs from a reconnaissance overflight by Siegfried Knemeyer (who received his first Iron Cross for the mission), which revealed the weaknesses of the defences and an abundance of targets. He directed Prien to enter Scapa Flow from the east via Kirk Sound, passing to the north of Lamb Holm, a small, low-lying island between Burray and Mainland. Prien initially mistook the more southerly Skerry Sound for the chosen route, and his sudden realisation that &quot;U-47&quot; was heading for the shallow blocked passage forced him to order a rapid turn to the northeast. On the surface, and illuminated by a bright display of the aurora borealis, the submarine threaded between the sunken blockships &quot;Seriano&quot; and &quot;Numidian&quot;, grounding itself temporarily on a cable strung from &quot;Seriano&quot;. It was briefly caught in the headlights of a taxi onshore, but the driver raised no alarm. On entering the harbour proper at 00:27 on 14 October, Prien entered a triumphant in the log and set a south-westerly course for several kilometres before reversing direction. To his surprise, the anchorage appeared to be almost empty; unknown to him, Forbes&#x27;s order to disperse the fleet had removed some of the biggest targets. &quot;U-47&quot; had been heading directly towards four warships, including the newly commissioned light cruiser , anchored off Flotta and Hoy distant, but Prien gave no indication he had seen them.

On the reverse course, a lookout on the bridge spotted &quot;Royal Oak&quot; lying approximately to the north, correctly identifying her as a battleship of the . Mostly hidden behind her was a second ship, only the bow of which was visible to &quot;U-47&quot;. Prien mistook her to be a battlecruiser of the , German intelligence later labelling her . She was in fact the First World War seaplane tender &quot;Pegasus&quot;.

At 00:58 &quot;U-47&quot; fired a salvo of three torpedoes from its bow tubes, a fourth lodging in its tube. Two failed to find a target, but a single torpedo struck the bow of &quot;Royal Oak&quot; at 01:04, shaking the ship and waking the crew. There was little visible damage, but the starboard anchor chain had been severed, clattering noisily down through its slips. Initially, it was suspected that there had been an explosion in the ship&#x27;s forward inflammable store, used to store materials such as kerosene. Mindful of the unexplained explosion that had destroyed at Scapa Flow in 1917, an announcement was made over &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s tannoy system to check the magazine temperatures, but many sailors returned to their hammocks, unaware the ship was under attack.

Prien turned his submarine and attempted another shot via his stern tube, but this too missed. Reloading his bow tubes, he doubled back and fired a salvo of three torpedoes, all at &quot;Royal Oak&quot;. This time he was successful. At 01:16, all three struck the battleship in quick succession amidships and detonated. The explosions blew a hole in the armoured deck, destroying the Stokers&#x27;, Boys&#x27; and Marines&#x27; messes and causing a loss of electrical power. Cordite from a magazine ignited and the ensuing fireball passed rapidly through the ship&#x27;s internal spaces. &quot;Royal Oak&quot; quickly listed to 15°, sufficient to push the open starboard-side portholes below the waterline. She soon rolled further onto her side to 45°, hanging there for several minutes before disappearing beneath the surface at 01:29, 13 minutes after Prien&#x27;s second strike. 835 men died with the ship or died later of their wounds. The dead included Rear-Admiral Henry Blagrove, commander of the Second Battle Squadron. 134 of the dead were boy seamen, not yet 18 years old, the largest ever such loss in a single Royal Navy action.

=== Rescue efforts ===
The tender &quot;Daisy 2&quot;, skippered by John Gatt, had been tied up for the night to &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s port side. As the sinking battleship began to list to starboard, Gatt ordered &quot;Daisy 2&quot; to be cut loose, his vessel becoming briefly caught on &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s rising anti-torpedo bulge and lifted from the sea before freeing herself.

Many of &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s crew who had managed to jump from the sinking ship were dressed in little more than their nightclothes and were unprepared for the chilling water. A thick layer of fuel oil coated the surface, filling men&#x27;s lungs and stomachs and hampering their efforts to swim. Of those who attempted the half-mile (800 m) swim to the nearest shore, only a handful survived.

&quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s port side pinnace was manoeuvred away from the sinking ship and paddled away using wooden boards as there had been insufficient time to raise steam. The boat became overladen and capsized 300 metres from &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, throwing those on deck into the water and trapping those below.

Gatt switched the lights of &quot;Daisy 2&quot; on and he and his crew managed to pull 386 men from the water, including &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s commander, Captain William Benn. The rescue efforts continued for another two and a half hours until nearly 4:00 am, when Gatt abandoned the search for more survivors and took those he had to &quot;Pegasus&quot;. Aided by boats from &quot;Pegasus&quot; and the harbour, he was responsible for rescuing almost all the survivors, an act for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the only military award made by the British in connection with the disaster. &quot;Pegasus&quot; had sent a message by signal lamp to the port signal station about five minutes after the sinking, saying &quot;General. Send all boats&quot;, and half an hour later &quot;&quot;Royal Oak&quot; is sinking after several internal explosions&quot;.

== Aftermath ==
The British were initially confused as to the cause of the sinking, suspecting either an on-board explosion or aerial attack. Once it was realised that a submarine attack was the most likely explanation, steps were rapidly made to seal the anchorage, but &quot;U-47&quot; had already escaped and was on its way back to Germany. The BBC released news of the sinking by late morning on 14 October, and its broadcasts were received by the German listening services and by &quot;U-47&quot; itself. Divers sent down on the morning after the explosion discovered remnants of a German torpedo, confirming the means of attack. On 17 October, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill officially announced the loss of &quot;Royal Oak&quot; to the House of Commons, first conceding that the raid had been &quot;a remarkable exploit of professional skill and daring&quot;, but then declaring that the loss would not materially affect the naval balance of power. An Admiralty board of inquiry convened between 18 and 24 October to establish the circumstances under which the anchorage had been penetrated. In the meantime, the Home Fleet was ordered to remain at safer ports until security issues at Scapa could be addressed. Churchill was obliged to respond to questions in the House as to why &quot;Royal Oak&quot; had had aboard so many boys, most of whom died. He defended the Royal Navy tradition of sending boys aged 15 to 17 to sea, but the practice was generally discontinued shortly after the disaster, and under 18-year-olds served on active warships in only the most exceptional circumstances.

The Nazi Propaganda Ministry was quick to capitalise on the successful raid, and radio broadcasts by the popular journalist Hans Fritzsche displayed the triumph felt throughout Germany. Prien and his crew reached Wilhelmshaven at 11:44 on 17 October and were immediately greeted as heroes, learning that Prien had been awarded the Iron Cross First Class, and each man of the crew the Iron Cross Second Class. Hitler sent his personal plane to bring the crew to Berlin, where he further invested Prien with the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. This decoration, made for the first time to a German submarine officer, later became the customary decoration for successful U-boat commanders. Dönitz was rewarded by promotion from Commodore to Rear-Admiral and was made Flag Officer of U-boats.

Prien was nicknamed &quot;The Bull of Scapa Flow&quot; and his crew decorated &quot;U-47&quot;″s conning tower with a snorting bull mascot, later adopted as the emblem of the 7th U-boat Flotilla. He found himself in demand for radio and newspaper interviews, and his &#x27;autobiography&#x27; was published the following year, titled . Ghost-written for him by a journalist, Paul Weymar, following some brief interviews with Prien in March and April 1940, the manuscript was edited by the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (the German high command) and the Reich Ministry of Propaganda. It was intended as an adventure story for boys. When Prien received a copy of the book, he angrily made numerous corrections to the text, and when an English translation of the book was published in 1955, Weymar wrote a letter of protest to the British publisher saying that the &quot;demonstrably false&quot; account should not have been published out of context and he donated his royalties to charity.

The Admiralty Board of Inquiry&#x27;s president was Admiral Reginald Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, assisted by Admiral Robert Raikes and Captain Gerard Muirhead-Gould. Their official report into the disaster condemned the defences at Scapa Flow, and censured Sir Wilfred French, Admiral Commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands, for their unprepared state. French was placed on the retired list, despite having warned the previous year of Scapa Flow&#x27;s deficient anti-submarine defences, and volunteering to bring a small ship or submarine himself past the blockships to prove his point. On Churchill&#x27;s orders, the eastern approaches to Scapa Flow were sealed with concrete causeways linking Lamb Holm, Glimps Holm, Burray and South Ronaldsay to Mainland. Constructed largely by Italian prisoners of war, the Churchill Barriers, as they became known, were essentially complete by September 1944, and were opened officially just after VE Day in May 1945.

In a second report, the Board of Inquiry considered the actual sinking of &quot;Royal Oak&quot; and the resulting loss of life, which having been in port and in calm water was thought to be &quot;very heavy&quot;. The report concluded that the main cause was due to an unusually high number of men having been below the main armoured deck because they had been sent to air defence stations. Their escape was slowed because of the number of watertight doors which were closed. The question of &quot;deadlights&quot; was also considered; these were ventilated metal plates that replaced the glass panes in the scuttles or portholes when ships were in port, allowing the wartime blackout to be observed. It was thought that water flooding through these had hastened the initial heeling over, but having the ventilators closed would not have saved the ship.

In the years that followed, a rumour circulated that Prien had been guided into Scapa by Alfred Wehring, a German agent living in Orkney in the guise of a Swiss watchmaker named Albert Oertel; following the attack, &#x27;Oertel&#x27; supposedly escaped in the submarine &quot;B-06&quot; to Germany. This account of events originated as an article by the journalist Curt Riess in the 16 May 1942 issue of the American magazine &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; and was later embellished by other authors. Post-war searches through German and Orcadian archives have failed to find any evidence for the existence of Oertel, Wehring or a submarine named &quot;B-06&quot;, and the story is now held to be wholly fictitious. In 1959, the Orkneys&#x27; preeminent watchmaker, Mr E. W. Hourton, informed &quot;with the utmost assurance&quot; the editor of &quot;The Orkney Herald&quot; that in his lifetime there had never been a watchmaker named Oertel in Kirkwall nor anyone resembling such a person. Orkney&#x27;s chief librarian, in a 1983 letter to the historian Nigel West, suggested that the name Albert Oertel was likely a pun on the well-known Albert Hotel in Kirkwall.

=== Survivors ===

In the immediate aftermath of the sinking, &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s survivors were billeted in the towns and villages of Orkney. A funeral parade for the dead took place at Lyness on Hoy on 16 October; many of the surviving crew, having lost all their own clothing on the ship, attended in borrowed boiler suits and gym shoes. They were generally granted a few days survivors&#x27; leave by the navy, and then assigned to ships and roles elsewhere.

Prien did not survive the war: he and &quot;U-47&quot; were lost on 7 March 1941, possibly as a result of an attack by the British destroyer . News of the loss was kept secret by the Nazi government for ten weeks. Several &quot;U-47&quot; crew from the &quot;Royal Oak&quot; mission did survive, having been transferred to other vessels. Some of them subsequently met with their former enemies from &quot;Royal Oak&quot; and forged friendships with them.

The HMS &quot;Royal Oak&quot; Association holds an Act of Remembrance annually at Portsmouth, the &quot;Royal Oak&#x27;s&quot; home port, on the Saturday nearest to 13 October; originally at the Naval Memorial at Southsea, but in later years at St Ann&#x27;s Church, Portsmouth Naval Base. At the service on 9 October 2019, eighty years after the sinking, a memorial stone was unveiled in the church by Anne, Princess Royal, the Commodore-in-Chief of HMNB Portsmouth. Some one hundred and fifty relatives and descendants of the crew were in attendance.

Kenneth Toop, who survived the sinking while serving as a boy, first class, on &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, served as the Association&#x27;s honorary secretary for fifteen years. The last remaining survivor of &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, Arthur Smith, died on 11 December 2016. Serving as a 17-year-old boy, first class, he had been on watch on the bridge when the ship was struck and jumped from the sinking vessel, swimming in the wrong direction until he was picked up by a boat and transferred to the &quot;Daisy 2&quot;.

== Wreck ==

=== Status as war grave ===
Despite the relatively shallow water in which she sank, the majority of bodies could not be recovered from &quot;Royal Oak&quot;. Marked by a buoy at , the wreck has been designated a war grave and all diving or other unauthorised forms of exploration are prohibited under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. In clear water conditions, the upturned hull can be seen reaching to within 5 m of the surface. The brass letters that formed &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s name were removed as a keepsake by a recreational diver in the 1970s. They were returned almost twenty years later, and are now displayed in the Scapa Flow visitor centre in Lyness. &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s loss is commemorated in an annual ceremony in which Royal Navy divers place the White Ensign underwater at her stern.

A memorial at St Magnus Cathedral in nearby Kirkwall displays a plaque dedicated to those who died, beneath which a book of remembrance lists their names. This list of names was not released by the Government until 40 years after the sinking. Each week a page of the book is turned. The ship&#x27;s bell was recovered in the 1970s and, after being restored, was added to the memorial in St Magnus. Twenty-six bodies, eight of which could not be identified, were interred at the naval cemetery in nearby Lyness.

=== Environmental concerns ===
&quot;Royal Oak&quot; sank fully fuelled with approximately 3,000 tons of furnace fuel oil aboard. The oil leaked from the corroding hull at an increased rate during the 1990s and concerns about the environmental impact led the Ministry of Defence to consider plans for extracting it. &quot;Royal Oak&quot;″s status as a war grave required that surveys and any proposed techniques for removing the oil be handled sensitively: plans in the 1950s to raise and salvage the wreck had been dropped in response to public opposition. In addition to the ethical concerns, poorly managed efforts could destabilise the wreck, resulting in a mass release of the remaining oil; the ship&#x27;s magazines also containing many tons of unexploded ordnance.

The MOD commissioned a series of multi-beam sonar surveys to image the wreck and appraise its condition. The high-resolution sonograms showed &quot;Royal Oak&quot; to be lying almost upside down with her top works forced into the seabed. The tip of the bow had been blown off by &quot;U-47&quot;″s first torpedo and a gaping hole on the starboard flank was the result of the triple strike from her second successful salvo. Following several years of delays, Briggs Marine was contracted by the MoD to conduct the task of pumping off the remaining oil. &quot;Royal Oak&quot;&#x27;s mid-construction conversion to fuel oil had placed her fuel tanks in unconventional positions, complicating operations. By 2006, all double bottom tanks had been cleared and the task of removing oil from the inner wing tanks with cold cutting equipment began the next year. By 2010, 1,600 tons of fuel oil had been removed, and the wreck was declared to be no longer actively releasing oil into Scapa Flow. Up to 783 m3 of oil is thought to remain within the ship; plans exist to resume pumping in mid-2021.

=== 2019 survey ===

Rebreather diver Emily Turton announced at the EUROTEK advanced diving conference in December 2018 that an international team of experts were surveying the wreck of &quot;Royal Oak&quot; to create a three-dimensional image of the war grave. This process takes thousands of man-hour dives over several months. The team used an extensive range of technology including videography, underwater photography and 3D photogrammetry to record the wreck. The survey had the support of the Royal Navy and the Royal Oak Association.

<doc id="485634" wikidata="Q1565225" url="?curid=485634" title="HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)">
<text>HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was the lead ship of her class of five dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the early 1910s, and was often used as a flagship. She served in the First World War as part of the Grand Fleet, and participated in the inconclusive action of 19 August 1916. Her service during the war generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. She and the other super-dreadnought battleships were the first of their type to be powered by oil instead of coal. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; later served in several theatres during the Second World War, and was scrapped in 1948.

== Design and description ==
The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class ships were designed to form a fast squadron for the fleet that was intended to operate against the leading ships of the opposing battleline. This required maximum offensive power and a speed several knots faster than any other battleship to allow them to defeat any type of ship.

=== Ship measures and propulsion ===
&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; had a length overall of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She had a normal displacement of and displaced at deep load. She was powered by two sets of Parsons steam turbines, each driving two shafts using steam from 24 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and intended to reach a maximum speed of . The ship had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 1,262 officers and ratings in 1920 while serving as a flagship.

=== Armament, sensors and fire control ===
The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class was equipped with eight breech-loading (BL) Mk I guns in four twin-gun turrets, in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Twelve of the fourteen BL Mk XII guns were mounted in casemates along the broadside of the vessel amidships; the remaining pair were mounted on the forecastle deck near the aft funnel and were protected by gun shields. The anti-aircraft (AA) armament were composed of two quick-firing (QF) 20 cwt Mk I guns. The ships were fitted with four submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, two on each broadside. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was completed with two fire-control directors fitted with rangefinders. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and the other was in the spotting top above the tripod foremast. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by &#x27;B&#x27; turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in March 1917, although one temporary director was fitted in November–December 1916.

=== Armour ===
The waterline belt of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class consisted of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick over the ships&#x27; vitals. The gun turrets were protected by of KC armour and were supported by barbettes thick. The ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from in thickness. The main conning tower was protected by 13 inches of armour. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the magazines and additional anti-flash equipment was added in the magazines.

=== Modifications ===
Between 1919 and 1927, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; underwent numerous modifications, including the enlargement of the foremast top. Rangefinders were installed on the gun turrets &quot;B&quot; and &quot;X&quot; as well as high angle rangefinders at the forward wheelhouse. Another high angle range finder was installed at the forward conning tower. The 3-inch guns were replaced by 4-inch guns. Radio direction finding equipment was installed at the aft end of the command platform with antenna above the helm station, the bridge superstructure was modified and funnels were combined into one unit. Furthermore, the superstructures for accommodating signal personnel and equipment were extended and the yards on the foremast were removed. In her 1937–1941 rebuild she was fitted with a tower bridge in place of her old bridge; her 6-inch (152 mm) guns were removed and replaced by 20 (10 × 2) 4.5 in (114 mm) guns in ten double turrets and several smaller anti-aircraft guns; horizontal armour was added; engines and boilers were replaced; and the elevation of her main battery was increased to 30 degrees. Deck armour was increased to 5 inches over the magazines, 2.5 inches over the machinery, while the new 4.5-inch guns had between 1 and 2 inches of armour. She also received facilities for aircraft with a launching catapult amidships New fire control equipment was installed, including the HACS Mk IV AA fire control system and the Admiralty Fire Control Table Mk VII for surface fire control of the main armament. This reconstruction was completed in January 1941, when Britain had been at war for over a year. The ship was fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets by February 1919, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. The platform was removed from &#x27;X&#x27; turret during her 1926–1927 refit; the other platform was removed sometime later.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, named after Elizabeth I of England, was laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard on 21 October 1912 and was launched on 16 October 1913, completing in January 1915 during the First World War. While still undergoing testing in the Mediterranean, the ship was sent to the Dardanelles for the Allied attempt to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war. During the attempted military invasion of the Gallipoli on 25 April, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was the flagship for General Sir Ian Hamilton, commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.

=== Dardanelles ===

After the ships of the British and French fleets had shelled the outer forts of the Gallipoli peninsula on 3 November 1914, it was decided to launch a complete amphibious operation in January 1915. Therefore, the Admiralty ordered a convoy of eight ships – including &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; – to the Dardanelles. She was scheduled to reach the Dardanelles on 15 February. But due to an accident off Gibraltar on 12 February, in which she had torn off the blades of one of her turbines and was thus no longer able to travel at more than half speed, her arrival was postponed to 25 February.
Upon their arrival on 25 February, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, together with &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, &quot;Irresistible&quot; and &quot;Gaulois&quot;, launched a new attack with the aim of destroying the outer forts at close range and all the way to the entrance. Since the attack on 19 February had shown how little hope there was of permanently disabling a battery by the mere firing of shells, the order for the attacking ships was to destroy every single gun by a direct hit. The general plan was for four ships to sail in groups of two to the entrance of the strait, turn around and then attack Cape Helles and Kum Kale with their secondary armament until they reached a distance of about 3,300 yards. 
In pursuance of these orders, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; anchored 7 miles southwest of the Cape Helles lighthouse, set her sights on Sedd el Bahr and took out the two modern 23 cm guns there. During the first week of March, several bombardments of the inner forts proved fruitless. On 5 March, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; fired for four hours from a distance of 13 kilometers at the forts on the European side of the strait, but with almost no effect. The next day she fired on Chemenlik, but the Ottomans had moved unnoticed the old pre-dreadnought &quot;Hairredin Barbarossa&quot; into the strait at Chanak, from where it could fire on &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. The first shells were ignored thinking they were coming from a mobile field howitzer, but to be safe they moved 1 km away from this position. When the Ottoman ship&#x27;s observation post on the coast was discovered, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, &quot;Agamemmnon &quot;and &quot;Ocean&quot; fired at it with several salvos, but the Ottomans quickly moved to a new position, so &quot;Hairredin Barbarossa&quot; fired again at &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, finally hitting her three times below the waterline. However, the shells could not penetrate the battleship&#x27;s belt armor. In order to avoid further damage, the ship withdrew from this position.

==== Main attack on 18 March ====
The event that decided the battle took place on the night of 18 March, when the Ottoman minelayer &quot;Nusret &quot;laid a series of mines across the head of Eren Köy Bay, a wide bay along the Asiatic coast right at the entrance to the strait, in front of the Kephez minefield. The Ottomans had noticed that the British ships were turning to starboard as they retreated into the bay. The new line of 20 mines ran parallel to the shore, anchored at a height of fifteen metres and spaced about 91 metres apart. Because of the clear water, the mines could be seen through the water by reconnaissance aircraft.
The British plan for 18 March was to take out the defences of the first five minefields, which were to be cleared overnight. The next day, the remaining defences around the Narrows were to be overcome and the last five minefields removed. The operation continued without the British and French knowing of the recent additions to the Ottoman minefields. The battleships were deployed in three lines, two British and one French, with support ships on the flanks and two ships in reserve. After &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; had slowly entered the strait under constant fire, she reached her attack position at around 11:00 and opened fire on the fortifications at Çanakkale at 11:25. At first, the attack seemed to go according to plan, but after several ships hit the mines laid earlier in the afternoon, it was decided to withdraw as darkness fell. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; took part in further naval operations with heavy losses until the beginning of May. But after several battleships were sunk in May, the Admiralty decided to cease constant battleship support. Thus, on 12 May, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; left the Dardanelles and returned home. 

She then proceeded to Gibraltar and on to Scapa Flow, where she joined the 5th Battle Squadron on 26 May 1916. From 22 May to 4 June 1916, she was overhauled at Rosyth, so she did not take part in the Battle of Jutland. Also in June, she temporarily became the flagship of the 5th Battle Squadron. In July, the ship underwent another overhaul. After her recommissioning in 1917, she briefly served as U.S. Admiral Mayo&#x27;s flagship.

===Interwar period===
On 15 November 1918, representatives of the German Empire signed the terms of the armistice with the Allies on board the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. On 26 July 1924 she took part in the annual fleet review off Spithead and on 1 November 1924 was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet to replace the Iron Duke as flagship. She was then replaced as flagship by &quot;Warspite&quot; in May 1926 and decommissioned in Portsmouth for refit. After the refit, which lasted until December 1927, she was recommissioned as flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet on 2 January 1928 and visited Istanbul in October 1929. From November 1929 to May 1930 she underwent another overhaul at Portsmouth. In July of the same year, she was detached to Alexandria with &quot;Ramillies&quot; to support local troops during the uprising by the Waft Party. From November 1932 to March 1933, the ship was overhauled in Portsmouth and took part in the fleet review off Spithead on 16 July 1935 during the 25th anniversary of George V&#x27;s throne jubilee. She was also in Alexandria during the Abyssinia Crisis and took part in the fleet review marking the coronation of George VI off Spithead on 19 May 1937.
During the 1930s she participated in the non-intervention blockade during the Spanish Civil War.

=== Second World War ===
On 1 August 1937, she was decommissioned for conversion work at Portsmouth, but had to be transferred from Portsmouth to Rosyth in December 1940, fearing air raids by the Luftwaffe. On 31 January 1941, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was recommissioned and assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Home Fleet.

==== Mediterranean Sea ====
In May 1941, she was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. On 6 May she departed Gibraltar for Alexandria and, together with Force H, formed convoy escorts to Malta. She then participated in the defence of Crete and the evacuation of British-Australian-New Zealand Expeditionary Force during the German Operation Merkur. On 26 May, she and &quot;Barham&quot; supported the air attack on the German base at Karpathos by aircraft from &quot;Formidable&quot;. On 27 May, she became the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron and flagship of the 2nd Fleet, replacing &quot;Barham&quot; which had been damaged by bombs during the battle.

On 19 December 1941, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and her sister ship were seriously damaged by limpet mines placed by Italian combat swimmers of Decima Flottiglia MAS, who entered the Allied military port of Alexandria with SLC type &quot;manned torpedoes&quot; (&quot;maiali&quot;). Although badly damaged, with her draught increased to 41.8 feet (12.5m), &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was not grounded on the harbour bottom, her decks were clear and the Italian crews were captured. For this reason, the Royal Navy maintained the illusion of full operational status, to conceal their weakened position in the Mediterranean during the period the two ships were repaired and refloated. &quot;Valiant&quot; went back into service after many months and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; after more than a year and a half. Following completion of temporary repairs in an Alexandria drydock in June 1942, she steamed through the Suez Canal and around Africa to the Navy Yard in Norfolk, Virginia, in the United States. From September 1942 until June 1943, she was comprehensively repaired. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; went to the Home Fleet in July 1943.

==== Pacific ====
On 23 December 1943, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; set sail bound for Trincomalee. Upon her arrival on 28 January 1944, C-in-C the Eastern Fleet Admiral Somerville assumed command. During Operation Cockpit, in formation with French and Dutch units, she supported &quot;Illustrious&quot; and the &quot;Saratoga&quot; in their attack on Sabang on 19 April. From 30 April to 1 May, she participated in the bombardment of Car Nicobar and Port Blair in the Andaman Islands during Operation D, after which the ship was overhauled at Durban from October to November 1944. In January 1945, she participated in further bombardments of Sabang during Operation Outflank and participated in the recapture of Burma until May where she supported the landing of Allied troops on Ramree Island on 21 January and on Cheduba Island on 26 January as part of Operation Dracula.

==== Post War ====
On 12 July 1945 she was replaced by HMS &quot;Nelson&quot; as flagship and returned home. After arriving in Portsmouth on 7 August 1945, she was detached to Rosyth for reserve duty on 10 August. From October 1945 to March 1946 she served the Home Fleet as accommodation ship. She was then reassigned to the Portsmouth Reserve where she remained until her decommissioning on 15 May 1948. In July 1948, she was sold to Arnott Young and scrapped at Troon.

<text>HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; was one of five s built for the Royal Navy during the early 1910s. Completed during the First World War in 1915, she was assigned to the Grand Fleet and participated in the Battle of Jutland. Other than that battle, and the inconclusive Action of 19 August, her service during the war generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. During the interwar period the ship was deployed in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, often serving as flagship, and was thoroughly modernised in the mid-1930s.

During the Second World War, &quot;Warspite&quot; was involved in the Norwegian Campaign in early 1940 and was transferred to the Mediterranean later that year where the ship participated in fleet actions against the Royal Italian Navy () while also escorting convoys and bombarding Italian troops ashore. She was damaged by German aircraft during the Battle of Crete in mid-1941 and required six months of repairs in the United States. They were completed after the start of the Pacific War in December and the ship sailed across the Pacific to join the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean in early 1942. &quot;Warspite&quot; returned home in mid-1943 to conduct naval gunfire support as part of Force H during the Italian campaign. She was badly damaged by German radio-controlled glider bombs during the landings at Salerno and spent most of the next year under repair. The ship bombarded German positions during the Normandy landings and on Walcheren Island in 1944, despite not being fully repaired. These actions earned her the most battle honours ever awarded to an individual ship in the Royal Navy. For this and other reasons, &quot;Warspite&quot; gained the nickname the &quot;Grand Old Lady&quot; after a comment made by Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham in 1943 while she was his flagship.

When she was launched in 1913 the use of oil as fuel and untried 15-inch guns were revolutionary concepts in the naval arms race between Britain and Germany, a considerable risk for Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, and Admiral of the Fleet Sir Jackie Fisher, who had advocated the design. However, the new &quot;fast battleships&quot; proved to be an outstanding success during the First World War. Decommissioned in 1945, &quot;Warspite&quot; ran aground under tow to be scrapped in 1947 on rocks near Prussia Cove, Cornwall, and was eventually broken up nearby.

&quot;Warspite&quot; was the sixth Royal Navy ship to bear the name. It likely originated from an archaic word for woodpecker, &#x27;speight&#x27;; with the implication that, during the age of sail the war-speight would peck holes in her enemies&#x27; wooden hulls.

== Design and description ==
The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class ships were designed to form a fast squadron for the fleet that was intended to operate against the leading ships of the opposing battleline. This required maximum offensive power and a speed several knots faster than any other battleship to allow them to defeat any type of ship.

&quot;Warspite&quot; had a length overall of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She had a normal displacement of and displaced at deep load. She was powered by two sets of Parsons steam turbines, each driving two shafts using steam from 24 Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at and intended to reach a maximum speed of . The ship had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 1,025 officers and ratings in 1915 and 1,220 in 1920.

The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class was equipped with eight breech-loading (BL) Mk I guns in four twin-gun turrets, in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Twelve of the fourteen BL Mk XII guns were mounted in casemates along the broadside of the vessel amidships; the remaining pair were mounted on the forecastle deck near the aft funnel and were protected by gun shields. The anti-aircraft (AA) armament were composed of two quick-firing (QF) 20 cwt Mk I guns. The ships were fitted with four submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, two on each broadside.

&quot;Warspite&quot; was completed with two fire-control directors fitted with rangefinders. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and the other was in the spotting top above the tripod mast. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by &#x27;B&#x27; turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in July 1917.

The waterline belt of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class consisted of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick over the ships&#x27; vitals. The gun turrets were protected by of KC armour and were supported by barbettes thick. The ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from in thickness. The main conning tower was protected by 13 inches of armour. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the magazines and additional anti-flash equipment was added in the magazines.

The ship was fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. Exactly when the platforms were removed is unknown, but no later than &quot;Warspite&quot;″s 1934–1937 reconstruction.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Warspite&quot;, the sixth warship of the Royal Navy to carry the name, was laid down on 21 October 1912 at Devonport Royal Dockyard, launched on 26 November 1913, and completed in April 1915 under the command of Captain Edward Phillpotts. &quot;Warspite&quot; joined the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet following a number of acceptance trials, including gunnery trials, which saw Churchill present when she fired her 15-inch (381 mm) guns. Churchill was suitably impressed with their accuracy and power. In late 1915, &quot;Warspite&quot; was grounded in the River Forth causing some damage to her hull; she had been led by her escorting destroyers down the small ships channel. After undergoing repairs for two months at Rosyth and Jarrow, she rejoined the Grand Fleet, this time as part of the new 5th Battle Squadron which had been created for &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class ships. In early December, &quot;Warspite&quot; was involved in another incident when, during an exercise, she collided with her sister ship , which caused considerable damage to &quot;Warspite&quot;″s bow. She made it back to Scapa Flow and from there to Devonport for more repair work, rejoining the fleet on Christmas Eve 1915.

===First World War===
====Battle of Jutland (1916)====

Following the German raid on Lowestoft in April 1916, &quot;Warspite&quot; and the 5th Battle Squadron were temporarily assigned to Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Force. On 31 May, &quot;Warspite&quot; was deployed with the squadron to fight in the Battle of Jutland, the largest naval encounter between Britain and Germany during the war. Following a signalling error, the battleships were left trailing Beatty&#x27;s fast ships during the battlecruiser action, and the 5th Battle Squadron was exposed to heavy fire from the German High Seas Fleet as the force turned away to the north, although &quot;Warspite&quot; was able to score her first hit on the battlecruiser .
The 5th Battle Squadron then headed north, exchanging fire with both Hipper&#x27;s battlecruiser force and the leading elements of Scheer&#x27;s battleships, damaging . When the squadron turned to join the Grand Fleet, the damage from a shell hitting the port-wing engine room caused &quot;Warspite&quot;″s steering to jam as she attempted to avoid her sister ships and . Captain Phillpotts decided to maintain course, in effect circling, rather than come to a halt and reverse. This decision exposed &quot;Warspite&quot; and made her a tempting target; she was hit multiple times, but inadvertently diverted attention from the armoured cruiser , which had been critically damaged whilst attacking the leading elements of the German fleet. This action gained her the admiration of &quot;Warrior&quot;″s surviving crew, who believed that &quot;Warspite&quot;″s movement had been intentional.
The crew regained control of &quot;Warspite&quot; after two full circles. Their efforts to end the circular motion placed her on a course which took her towards the German fleet. The rangefinders and the transmission station were non-functional and only &quot;A&quot; turret could fire, albeit under local control with 12 salvos falling short of their target. Sub Lieutenant Herbert Annesley Packer was subsequently promoted for his command of &quot;A&quot; turret. Rather than continue, &quot;Warspite&quot; was stopped for ten minutes so the crew could make repairs. They succeeded in correcting the problem, but the ship would be plagued with steering irregularities for the rest of her naval career. As the light faded the Grand Fleet crossed ahead of the German battle line and opened fire, forcing the High Seas Fleet to retreat and allowing &quot;Warspite&quot; to slip away.

&quot;Warspite&quot; was hit fifteen times during the battle, and had 14 killed and 16 wounded; among the latter warrant officer Walter Yeo, who became one of the first men to receive facial reconstruction via plastic surgery. Although she had been extensively damaged, &quot;Warspite&quot; could still raise steam and was ordered back to Rosyth during the evening of 31 May by Rear-Admiral Hugh Evan-Thomas, commander of the 5th Battle Squadron. Whilst travelling across the North Sea the ship came under attack from a German U-boat. The U-boat fired three torpedoes, all of which missed their target. &quot;Warspite&quot; later attempted to ram a surfaced U-boat. She signalled ahead for escorts and a squadron of torpedo boats came out to meet her. They were too slow to screen her effectively, but there were no more encounters with German vessels and she reached Rosyth safely on the morning of 1 June, where it took two months to repair the damage.

====1916–1918====
Upon the completion of her repairs, &quot;Warspite&quot; rejoined the 5th Battle Squadron. Further misfortune struck soon afterwards, when she collided with &quot;Valiant&quot; after a night-shooting exercise, necessitating more repair work at Rosyth. Captain Philpotts avoided reprimand on this occasion, but was moved to a shore-based job as Naval Assistant to the new First Sea Lord, Admiral Jellicoe. He was replaced by Captain de Bartolome in December 1916. In June 1917, &quot;Warspite&quot; collided with a destroyer, but did not require major repairs. Early in April 1918 she joined the Grand Fleet in a fruitless pursuit of the German High Seas Fleet which had been hunting for a convoy near Norway. In 1918, &quot;Warspite&quot; had to spend four months being repaired after a boiler room caught fire. Captain Hubert Lynes relieved Captain de Bartolome and on 21 November he took &quot;Warspite&quot; out to escort the German High Seas Fleet into internment at Scapa Flow following the signing of the Armistice.

===Interbellum (1919–1939)===
In 1919, &quot;Warspite&quot; joined the 2nd Battle Squadron, part of the newly formed Atlantic Fleet, and undertook regular spring cruises to the Mediterranean. In 1924, she attended a Royal Fleet Review at Spithead, presided over by King George V. Later in the year, &quot;Warspite&quot; underwent a partial modernisation that altered her superstructure by trunking her two funnels into one, enhanced her armour protection with torpedo bulges, swapped the high-angle 3-inch guns with new 4-inch anti-aircraft guns, and removed half her torpedo tubes. After the process finished in 1926, &quot;Warspite&quot; assumed the role of flagship of the Commander-in-Chief and Second-in-Command, Mediterranean Fleet. In 1927, under the command of Captain James Somerville, she struck an uncharted rock in the Aegean and was ordered to return to Portsmouth for repairs. In 1930, &quot;Warspite&quot; rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. She was at sea when the crews of a number of warships mutinied at Invergordon in September 1931, although three sailors were later dismissed from the ship. In March 1933, she was rammed in fog by a Romanian passenger ship off Portugal, but did not require major repairs.

Between March 1934 and March 1937, she underwent a major reconstruction in Portsmouth at a cost of £2,363,000. This refit gave the Admiralty a virtually new warship, replacing internal machinery and significantly changing the battleship&#x27;s appearance and capabilities.
* Propulsion: The reconstruction project replaced her propulsion machinery and installed six individual boiler rooms, with Admiralty three-drum boilers, in place of 24 Yarrow boilers; geared Parsons turbines were fitted in four new engine rooms and gearing rooms. This increased fuel efficiency, reducing fuel consumption from 41 tons per hour to 27 at almost 24 knots, and gave the warship 80,000 shp. The weight saving on the lighter machinery was used to increase protection and armament.
* Armour: of armour were added, improving coverage forward of A turret and the boiler rooms, as well as an increase to 5 inches over the magazines and 3.5 inches over the machinery. Better sub-division of the engineering rooms strengthened the hull and improved its integrity.
* Armament: The last pair of torpedo tubes were removed and the 6 inch guns had their protection reduced; four guns were removed from the fore and aft ends of the batteries. Eight 4 inch high-angle guns in four twin mountings and two octuple 2 pdr pom-poms were added to her anti-aircraft defences, as well as additional .50 calibre machine guns on two of the main turrets. The original 15-inch turrets were upgraded to increase the elevation of the guns by ten degrees (from 20° to 30°), providing a further 9,000 yards of range to a maximum of with a 6crh shell. The fire control was also modernised to include the HACS Mk III* AA fire control system and the Admiralty Fire Control Table Mk VII for surface fire control of the main armament.

Additionally, her superstructure was radically altered, allowing two cranes and an aircraft hangar to be fitted. This could carry four aircraft, but &quot;Warspite&quot; typically carried only two: from 1938 to 1941 these were Swordfish floatplanes and from 1942 to 1943 Walrus flying boats. Her tripod mast was removed and a distinctive armoured citadel built up to enclose the bridge and to provide space for her to operate as a flagship.

After completion of the refit, &quot;Warspite&quot; was recommissioned under the command of Captain Victor Crutchley. The intention was for her to become the flagship of Admiral Dudley Pound&#x27;s Mediterranean Fleet, but trials revealed problems with propulsion machinery and steering, a legacy of Jutland, which continued to beset &quot;Warspite&quot; and delayed her departure. These delays and the work required to rectify them also affected the crew&#x27;s leave arrangements and led to some sailors airing their views in national newspapers, angering Pound. &quot;Warspite&quot; finally entered Grand Harbour, in Malta, on 14 January 1938 and continued gunnery practice and training. At the end of one anti-aircraft exercise, a junior midshipman independently discharged his pom-pom gun after a towing aircraft flew low overhead to display its attached target to the crew. &quot;Warspite&quot; had turned towards Valletta on the exercise&#x27;s conclusion and the shells hurtled towards the city. The shells landed harmlessly at a gunnery range where a platoon of the Green Howards was exercising. For the remainder of the year, she cruised the Aegean, Adriatic and Mediterranean seas, leading an intensive series of fleet exercises in August due to rising international tension. She undertook another cruise of the western Mediterranean in the spring of 1939. In June 1939, Vice Admiral Andrew Cunningham replaced Dudley Pound and took &quot;Warspite&quot; to Istanbul for talks with the Turkish government. When war was declared in September, the Mediterranean remained quiet and &quot;Warspite&quot; was recalled to join the Home Fleet following the loss of .

===Second World War===

====Atlantic and Narvik (1939–1940)====

&quot;Warspite&quot;″s first task was to escort convoy HX 9 carrying fuel from Nova Scotia to the UK. She was diverted northwards in pursuit of the German battleships and which had sunk the armed merchant cruiser north of the Faroe Islands, but failed to make contact.

In April 1940, &quot;Warspite&quot; had started her voyage back to the Mediterranean when the Germans invaded Denmark and Norway; she rejoined the Home Fleet on 10 April and proceeded towards Narvik. On 13 April, Vice-Admiral William Whitworth hoisted his flag in &quot;Warspite&quot; and led nine destroyers, three sweeping mines and six in an offensive role, into Ofotfjord to neutralise a force of eight German destroyers trapped near the port of Narvik. Her Fairey Swordfish float-plane sank the German U-boat with 250 lb bombs, becoming the first aircraft to sink a U-boat in the war. The Swordfish continued to provide accurate spotting reports during the early afternoon which were, arguably, more important to the course of the battle than the &quot;Warspite&#x27;s&quot; guns. The British destroyers soon opened fire on their counterparts, which had almost exhausted their fuel and ammunition following the First Naval Battle of Narvik. All were sunk during the action. &quot;Warspite&quot; destroyed the heavily damaged with broadsides, while damaging and . &quot;Diether von Roeder&quot; had to be scuttled while &quot;Erich Giese&quot; was sunk in conjunction with destroyers. The Second Naval Battle of Narvik was considered a success. She remained in Norwegian waters, participating in several shore bombardments around Narvik on 24
April, but these proved ineffectual and she returned to Scapa Flow prior to being redeployed to the Mediterranean on 28 April.

====Mediterranean (1940–1941)====
=====Calabria=====
&quot;Warspite&quot; arrived safely in Alexandria before Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940. Admiral Cunningham took the fleet to sea on 7 July to meet two convoys travelling from Malta to Alexandria, knowing that part of the Italian fleet was escorting its own convoy to Tripoli. Cunningham hoped to draw the Regia Marina into battle by sailing towards the &quot;toe&quot; of Italy to cut them off from their base at Taranto. The two fleets eventually met 30 miles from Punta Stilo at the Battle of Calabria on 9 July 1940. Initially, the Allied cruisers, armed with 6-inch guns, were outranged by the 8-inch guns of their heavier Italian counterparts and disengaged. Seeing that they were under pressure, Cunningham took &quot;Warspite&quot; ahead to assist his cruisers. The Italian cruisers turned away under a smoke screen while the battleships and closed on &quot;Warspite&quot; before &quot;Malaya&quot; and could catch up.

During the battle &quot;Warspite&quot; achieved one of the longest range gunnery hits from a moving ship to a moving target in history, hitting &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; at a range of approximately , the other being a shot from &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; which hit at approximately the same distance in June 1940. The shell pierced &quot;Giulio Cesare&#x27;s&quot; rear funnel and detonated inside it, blowing out a hole nearly across, while fragments started several fires and their smoke was drawn into the boiler rooms, forcing four boilers off-line as their operators could not breathe which reduced the ship&#x27;s speed to . Uncertain how severe the damage was, Campioni ordered his battleships to turn away in the face of superior British numbers and they disengaged behind a smoke screen laid by Italian destroyers. The destroyers and cruisers on both sides continued shooting for half an hour but with &quot;Malaya&quot; and &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; coming into range, the Italian fleet disengaged. Over 125 aircraft of the Regia Aeronautica attacked the ships over the next three hours but caused no damage. &quot;Warspite&quot; returned to Alexandria on 13 July.

=====Taranto=====

In mid-August, she set out to bombard Bardia and on 6 November she sailed from Alexandria to provide cover for the Battle of Taranto, a torpedo-bomber attack on ships in Taranto harbour. As a result of this attack, &quot;Warspite&quot; and &quot;Valiant&quot; were able to bombard the Italian supply base in the Adriatic port of Vlorë in mid-December. On 10 January 1941, &quot;Warspite&quot; was lightly damaged by a bomb while operating with Force A during Operation Excess.

=====Matapan=====
In March 1941, to support the planned German invasion of the Balkans, Vice Admiral Angelo Iachino&#x27;s Italian fleet, led by the battleship , sailed to intercept Allied convoys between Egypt and Greece. Warned of the Italian intentions by intelligence from the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Admiral Cunningham took his fleet to sea on 27 March 1941, flying his flag on &quot;Warspite&quot;. On 28 March, the British cruisers encountered the Italian fleet and were forced to turn away by the heavy guns of &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;. To save his cruisers Cunningham ordered an air attack, prompting Iachino to retreat. Subsequent air attacks damaged the battleship and the cruiser , slowing the former and crippling the latter. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; escaped to the west as dusk fell but the British pursued through the night, first detecting &quot;Pola&quot; on radar and then two of her sister ships. &quot;Warspite&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot; and &quot;Barham&quot; closed on the unsuspecting Italian ships and aided by searchlights, destroyed the heavy cruisers and and two destroyers at point blank range. &quot;Pola&quot; was also sunk once her crew had been taken off. Having established by aerial reconnaissance that the rest of the Italian fleet had escaped, &quot;Warspite&quot; returned to Alexandria on 29 March, surviving air attacks without suffering casualties.

The Battle of Cape Matapan had a paralysing effect on the &quot;Regia Marina&quot;, providing the Royal Navy with an opportunity to tighten its grip on the Mediterranean, as evidenced by the unequal Battle of the Tarigo Convoy near the Kerkennah Islands on 16 April. This was not enough and the success of the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; in North Africa induced Churchill to order a desperate attack on Tripoli to block the Axis supply route by sinking a battleships in the harbour. Cunningham rejected this plan, but on 21 April he sailed with &quot;Warspite&quot; to bombard the harbour in company with and , the cruiser and several destroyers. The raid was ineffectual, partly because of poor visibility created by dust from an earlier RAF bombing raid; the fleet returned to Alexandria without damage. The futility of the mission and the exposure of his battleships led to a tense exchange of letters between Cunningham and Churchill.

=====Crete=====

During the Battle of Crete, &quot;Warspite&quot; was used as a floating anti-aircraft battery and like many other ships, suffered severe damage from German air attacks on 22 May. A 500 lb bomb damaged her starboard 4-inch and 6-inch batteries, ripped open the ship&#x27;s side and killed 38 men. The attack was carried out by &quot;Jagdgeschwader 77&quot; (JG 77—Fighter Wing 77). &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Kurt Ubben, a future flying ace with 110 enemy aircraft shot down, claimed a hit on the warship. She was able to make it back to port under her own steam, but the damage could not be repaired in Alexandria and it was decided that she would have to be sent to Bremerton on the west coast of the United States.

====Repair and refit====
In June 1941, &quot;Warspite&quot; departed Alexandria for the Bremerton Naval Shipyard in the United States, arriving there on 11 August, having travelled through the Suez Canal, across the Indian Ocean to Ceylon, stopping at Manila, then Pearl Harbor and finally Esquimalt along the way. Repairs and modifications began in August, including the replacement of her deteriorated 15-inch guns, the addition of more anti-aircraft weapons, improvements to the bridge, and new surface and anti-aircraft radar. &quot;Warspite&quot; was still at the shipyard when the Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor and went on alert as she would have been one of the few ships in the harbour which could have provided anti-aircraft defence should the Japanese have struck east. She was recommissioned on 28 December and undertook sea trials near Vancouver before sailing down the west coast of the U.S. and Mexico, crossing the equator and arriving in Sydney on 20 February 1942. She joined the Eastern Fleet at Trincomalee in March 1942.

====Indian Ocean (1942–1943)====

&quot;Warspite&quot; joined the Eastern Fleet as flagship of Admiral Sir James Somerville, who had commanded her in 1927. Initially, &quot;Warspite&quot; was based in Ceylon, forming a fast group with the aircraft carriers and , four cruisers and six destroyers. In March, Somerville received intelligence indicating the Japanese Fast Carrier Strike Force was heading towards the Indian Ocean and he relocated his base to Addu Atoll in the Maldives.
Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo used five carriers and four battleships in the Indian Ocean raid a naval sortie into the Indian Ocean in April, attacking Allied shipping and bases in the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. Somerville&#x27;s fleet was outnumbered and outclassed but he hoped to get close enough to launch a night-time torpedo bomber attack. &quot;Warspite&quot;″s fast group set sail to intercept on 4 April, detecting the Japanese attack on the cruisers and and later, a scouting aircraft from the cruiser . The fleets did not meet; &quot;Warspite&quot; withdrew to Addu Atoll and then to Kilindini on the East African coast to protect the convoy routes. The Japanese believed that she was still in Sydney and ordered the attack on Sydney Harbour.

During May and June, &quot;Warspite&quot; continued to act as Somerville&#x27;s flagship, carrying out exercises with other elements of the fleet and shore-based aircraft in Ceylon. In early June, she was sent to hunt the Japanese auxiliary cruisers and &quot;Hōkoku Maru&quot; near the Chagos Archipelago but failed to find them.

In August, she was involved in Operation Stab, a simulated attack on the Andaman Islands to distract the Japanese from U.S. preparations to attack Guadalcanal. She covered the landings at Mahajanga and Tamatave during the Battle of Madagascar an Allied invasion, in September. Her surface radar was replaced in Durban in October and Captain Packer, her former Assistant Gunnery Officer at Jutland, took command in January 1943. The remainder of &quot;Warspite&quot;″s cruise was uneventful. She underwent a short refit in Durban in April and returned to the UK in May 1943, having sailed approximately 160,000 miles since the war began.

====Mediterranean (1943–1944)====

&quot;Warspite&quot; underwent a short refit in May in another attempt to fix her steering problem, then joined Force H at Scapa Flow, departing on 9 June for Gibraltar in company with five other battleships, two carriers and twelve destroyers. Assigned to Division 2 with &quot;Valiant&quot; and &quot;Formidable&quot;, she returned to Alexandria on 5 July in preparation for Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Division One and Two rendezvoused in the Gulf of Sirte on 9 July and covered the assembling convoys. &quot;Warspite&quot; was detached to refuel at Malta on 12 July, the first visit by a British battleship since December 1940. On 17 July, she bombarded Catania in support of an unsuccessful attack by the 8th Army, although her steering problem temporarily delayed her taking up position. She returned to Malta at high speed on 18 July, avoiding several air attacks during the night. On her return, Admiral Cunningham inadvertently coined the nickname by which she would be known thereafter when he signalled: &quot;Operation well carried out. There is no question when the old lady lifts her skirts she can run.&quot;
Between 2 and 3 September, &quot;Warspite&quot; and &quot;Valiant&quot; covered the assault across the Straits of Messina and bombarded the Italian coastal batteries near Reggio. Between 8 and 9 September, Force H, covering the landings at Salerno, came under fierce German air-attack and narrowly avoided being torpedoed. The resolve of the Italian Government had already been wavering by the time of the Allies victory in North Africa; the invasion of Sicily and aerial attacks on mainland Italy encouraged negotiations. They signed an armistice on 3 September, which took effect on 8 September. Anxious to ensure that the Germans did not acquire an additional 200 warships, the Allies insisted that the Regia Marina must sail for Allied ports. Three days later, &quot;Warspite&quot; met and led elements of the Italian Fleet, including &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; and &quot;Italia&quot;, into internment at Malta. She repeated this process on 12 September for her opponent from the Battle of Calabria, &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;.
On 14 September, Force H was recalled to the UK to begin preparations for the invasion of France, but &quot;Warspite&quot; and &quot;Valiant&quot; were detached to provide support for Allied forces at Salerno. Although the Italians had surrendered, the Germans had anticipated this and moved forces into position to block the Allied landings. The American forces near Battipaglia were in a precarious situation following German counter-attacks. After arriving off Salerno on 15 September, &quot;Warspite&quot; bombarded an ammunition dump and other positions around Altavilla Silentina, demoralising the German forces and providing time for Allied reinforcements to arrive. Overnight, the fleet came under intense air attack, but she was able to continue bombardment duties the next day. However, early in the afternoon she was attacked by a Luftwaffe squadron of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter bombers and then, from high altitude, by three Dornier Do 217 bombers from KG 100 armed with an early guided bomb, the Fritz X. She was hit directly once; a second near-miss ripped open the torpedo bulges while the third missed altogether. The bomb that did hit her struck near the funnel, cutting through her decks and making a 20-foot hole in the bottom of her hull, crippling her. Although the damage had been considerable, &quot;Warspite&quot;″s casualties amounted to only nine killed and fourteen wounded.

She was soon on the journey to Malta, escorted by the anti-aircraft cruiser and four destroyers, while being towed by United States Navy tugs. Towing a ship of &quot;Warspite&quot;″s dimensions proved difficult, and at one stage she broke all tow lines and drifted sideways through the Straits of Messina. She reached Malta on 19 September and undertook emergency repairs before being towed to Gibraltar on 12 November. &quot;Warspite&quot; returned to Britain in March 1944 to continue her repairs at Rosyth. Captain Packer was mentioned in despatches for his actions bringing the ship to Malta, the second time he had limped into port on board a heavily damaged &quot;Warspite&quot;.

====North-Western Europe (1944–1945)====
At Rosyth, &quot;Warspite&quot;″s 6-inch guns were removed and plated in, and a concrete caisson covered the hole left by the German bomb. One of her boiler rooms and the X turret could not be repaired, remaining out of action for the remainder of her career. She left Greenock on 2 June 1944 with six 15-inch guns, eight 4-inch anti-aircraft guns and forty pom poms, joining Bombardment Force D of the Eastern Task Force of the Normandy invasion fleet off Plymouth two days later.

At 0500 on 6 June 1944, &quot;Warspite&quot; was the first ship to open fire, bombarding the German battery at Villerville from a position 26,000 yards offshore, to support landings by the British 3rd Division on Sword Beach. She continued bombardment duties on 7 June, but after firing over 300 shells she had to rearm and crossed the Channel to Portsmouth. She returned to Normandy on 9 June to support American forces at Utah Beach and then, on 11 June, she took up position off Gold Beach to support the British 69th Infantry Brigade near Cristot. On 12 June, she returned to Portsmouth to rearm, but her guns were worn out so she was ordered to sail to Rosyth via the Straits of Dover, the first British battleship to have done so since the war began. She evaded German coastal batteries, partly due to effective radar jamming, but hit a mine 28 miles off Harwich early on 13 June. Repairs to her propeller shafts and the replacement of the guns took until early August; she sailed to Scapa Flow to calibrate the new barrels with only three functional shafts, limiting her top speed to 15 knots, although by now the Admiralty considered her main role was that of a bombardment vessel.

&quot;Warspite&quot; arrived off Ushant on 25 August 1944 and attacked the coastal batteries at Le Conquet and Pointe Saint-Mathieu during the Battle for Brest. The U.S. VIII Corps eventually captured &quot;Festung Brest&quot; on 19 September, but by then &quot;Warspite&quot; had moved on to the next port. In company with the monitor , she carried out a preparatory bombardment of targets around Le Havre prior to Operation Astonia on 10 September, leading to the capture of the town two days later. Her final task was to support an Anglo-Canadian operation to open up the port of Antwerp, which had been captured in September, by clearing the Scheldt Estuary of German strongholds and gun emplacements. With the monitors &quot;Erebus&quot; and , she bombarded targets on Walcheren Island on 1 November 1944, returning to Deal the next day, having fired her guns for the last time.

===Decommissioning===
During her service career, &quot;Warspite&quot; had lived up to her motto, enduring shellfire, bombing, ramming, mines and a guided missile. However, time had taken its toll and more modern ships were required to continue the war in the Far East. Although there were proposals to retain her as a museum ship, the Admiralty approved &quot;Warspite&quot;″s scrapping in July 1946 and she sailed from Spithead into Portsmouth to have her guns removed.

On 19 April 1947, &quot;Warspite&quot; departed Portsmouth for scrapping at Faslane, on the River Clyde. On the way, she encountered a severe storm and the hawser of the naval tug &quot;Bustler&quot; parted, whilst the other tug &quot;Metinda III&quot; slipped her tow. In storm force conditions, &quot;Warspite&quot; dropped one of her anchors in Mount&#x27;s Bay, which did not hold, and the storm drove her onto Mount Mopus Ledge near Cudden Point. Later refloating herself she went hard aground a few yards away in Prussia Cove. Her skeleton crew of seven was saved by the Penlee Lifeboat &quot;W. &amp; S.&quot; There were several attempts to refloat her but the hull was badly damaged.

In 1950, an attempt to re-float her was tried. A large crowd and the media watched on as the salvage crew set to work. Despite the use of 24 compressor tanks pumping air into her tanks, the salvage failed. There was insufficient depth of water to float her clear of the reef in a rising south westerly gale. The salvage boat &quot;Barnet&quot;, standing guard overnight under the &quot;Warspite&quot;&#x27;s bows was holed in the engine room, towed off and eventually drifted ashore at Long Rock, a few miles to the west. However, by August the battleship was finally beached off St Michael&#x27;s Mount and after further salvage another attempt was made to refloat her in November. The Falmouth tug &quot;Masterman&quot; spent the night on the Hogus Rocks after failing to tow &quot;Warspite&quot;; and her sister tug &quot;Tradesman&quot; had of wire wrapped around her propeller when trying to haul &quot;Masterman&quot; off the rocks. Aided by her compressor and two jet engines from an experimental aircraft the hulk was finally moved closer to shore on Marazion beach, between St Michael&#x27;s Mount and Hogus rocks. From 1951, Warspite was progressively broken up and scrapped in situ on the beach and by the summer of 1955, on-site scrapping resulted in her disappearance from view. According to the contractors, it remains the largest salvage operation ever carried out in British waters.
A memorial stone was placed near the sea wall at Marazion and later moved a short distance. The stone was unveiled by Admiral Sir Charles Madden and prayers were read by a former crew member. The remains of the masts lie in the yard at Porthenalls House, Prussia Cove and one portion was erected on a headland, overlooking Prussia Cove. One of her 15-inch tompions and her chapel door are held by the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth. Her nameplate was held by the pub, The Wink, in Lamorna, Cornwall but has since been sold at auction. Her ship&#x27;s wheel was given by King George VI to King Haakon VII of Norway in 1947, who later gave it to the City of Narvik. It is kept in the City Hall of Narvik. Her white ensign and other artefacts are held in Marazion Museum. Timbers from the ship would also be used to create commemorative souvenirs of various types, such as ashtrays and letter openers, as well as teak benches, including ones at the Castle on St Michael&#x27;s Mount and in Morrab Gardens, Penzance.

<text>HMS &quot;Valiant&quot; was one of five s built for the Royal Navy during the early 1910s. She participated in the Battle of Jutland during the First World War as part of the Grand Fleet. Other than that battle, and the inconclusive Action of 19 August, her service during the war generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. She saw further action during the Second World War in the Mediterranean and Far East.

== Design and description ==
The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class ships were designed to form a fast squadron for the fleet that was intended to operate against the leading ships of the opposing battleline. This required maximum offensive power and a speed several knots faster than any other battleship to allow them to defeat any type of ship.

=== Ship measures and propulsion ===
&quot;Valiant&quot; had a length overall of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She had a normal displacement of and displaced at deep load. She was powered by two sets of Brown-Curtis steam turbines, each driving two shafts using steam from 24 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and intended to reach a maximum speed of . The ship had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 919 officers and ratings in 1915 and 1,218 in 1919.

=== Armament, sensors and fire control ===
The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class was equipped with eight breech-loading (BL) Mk I guns in four twin-gun turrets, in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Twelve of the fourteen BL Mk XII guns were mounted in casemates along the broadside of the vessel amidships; the remaining pair were mounted on the forecastle deck near the aft funnel and were protected by gun shields. The anti-aircraft (AA) armament were composed of two quick-firing (QF) 20 cwt Mk I guns. The ships were fitted with four submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, two on each broadside.

&quot;Valiant&quot; was completed with two fire-control directors fitted with rangefinders. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and the other was in the spotting top above the tripod mast. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by &#x27;B&#x27; turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in July 1917.

=== Armour ===
The waterline belt of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class consisted of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick over the ships&#x27; vitals. The gun turrets were protected by of KC armour and were supported by barbettes thick. The ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from in thickness. The main conning tower was protected by 13 inches of armour. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the magazines and additional anti-flash equipment was added in the magazines.

The ship was fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. During her 1929–1930 refit, the platform was removed from &#x27;X&#x27; turret and a folding Type EIH catapult was installed on the quarterdeck, along with a crane to recover a floatplane. The platform atop &#x27;B&#x27; turret, the catapult and its crane were removed when &quot;Valiant&quot; was reconstructed in 1937–1939.

=== Modifications ===
Between 1929 and 1930 anti-torpedo bulges were added, increasing beam to . The two funnels were trunked into one and a single octuple 2-pounder mountings was added. Two of the torpedo tubes were removed, and the aircraft platforms were replaced by a single catapult. These modifications brought the maximum displacement up to 35,970 tons. In 1936 a second octuple 2 pdr mounting was added.
Between March 1937 and November 1939 she underwent a complete rebuild at Devonport. The machinery was changed to eight Admiralty 3 drum boilers with four Parsons steam turbines producing a total of . Fuel load was 3,393 tons oil, and maximum speed was reduced to despite the increase in power, due to the increase in displacement and draught. Deck armour was increased to over the magazines, over the machinery while the new guns had between and of armour. The secondary armament was changed to 20 × Mk I dual purpose guns in 10 twin mountings and the close range anti-aircraft armament consisted of four octuple 2 pdr &quot;pom pom&quot; mountings. The ship&#x27;s fire control was modernised to include the HACS MkIV AA fire control system and the Admiralty Fire Control Table Mk VII for surface fire control of the main armament. These modifications increased draught to and maximum displacement to 36,513 tons.

==Construction and career==
&quot;HMS Valiant&quot; was laid down at the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Govan on 31 January 1913, launched on 4 November 1914 and commissioned on 19 February 1916 under the command of Captain Maurice Woollcombe for service in the Grand Fleet.

===First World War===
Upon completion on 19 February 1916, under Captain Maurice Woollcombe, &quot;Valiant&quot; joined the recently formed Fifth Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet. In an attempt to lure part of the Grand Fleet out of its ports and destroy it, the German High Seas Fleet, consisting of 16 battleships, 6 battle cruisers, and other ships, left Wilhelmshaven early on the morning of 31 May. The plan called for Hipper to leave Wilhelmshaven with the battlecruisers of the 1st and the light cruisers of the 2nd Reconnaissance Group and push north out of sight of the Danish coast. There he was to provoke a departure of British ships by attacking coastal towns and lure them toward the High Seas Fleet. The intelligence Division of the British Admiralty Room 40 had intercepted and decoded German radio traffic containing operational plans. As a result, the Admiralty ordered Jellicoe and Beatty to sail that night with the Grand Fleet from Scapa Flow, Cromarty, and Rosyth to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.
After the 5th Battle Squadron departed Rosyth that morning, Beatty ordered a course change to the northeast at 2:15 p.m. to join up with Grand Fleet. At 2:20, Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers spotted Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers. At 2:32, Beatty ordered a course change to the east-southeast to cut off the Germans&#x27; line of retreat. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard and set a southeasterly course. With this turn, Hipper fell back to the High Seas Fleet, which was behind him. Beatty then also changed course to the east to catch up with Hipper.
By 3:05, the 5th Battle Squadron had reached a distance to attack the German light cruisers. By 3:08, the 5th Battle Squadron had reached the rear of the German battlecruisers and &quot;Valiant&quot; opened fire on the SMS &quot;Moltke&quot;, which received one hit. The situation changed when the German battleships came into view at 3:40. Since Beatty had failed to sufficiently signal his intentions when he turned north, the battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron were on an opposite course past the battlecruisers and headed directly for the approaching main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 3:48 Scheer opened fire on the British battleships. &quot;Valiant&quot; managed to avoid hits and in turn fired on three German ships from a distance of 14 to 16 kilometers at 4:30. &quot;Valiant&quot; continued to participate in the battle until the enemy came out of sight at a distance of 17 kilometers at about 5:02.

===Inter-war period===
From 1919 to the end of 1924 &quot;Valiant&quot; was part of the 1st Battle Squadron, Atlantic Fleet after which she was with the 1st Battle Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet until March 1929. On 2 December 1930 she was recommissioned for service in the Atlantic where in 1931 her crew participated in the Invergordon Mutiny. March 1932 saw her transferred to the Home Fleet until in July 1935 she was once again in the Mediterranean.

===World War II===
On 30 November 1939 &quot;Valiant&quot; was commissioned at Devonport and assigned to the America and West Indies Station.
Returning to Britain in December 1939, she escorted Canadian troops across the Atlantic and joined Home Fleet on 7 January 1940. &quot;Valiant&quot; engaged in escort duty for troop transports and in May 1940 supported the British landing forces in the Norwegian campaign. While there, the battleship narrowly escaped a torpedo fired by &quot;U 38&quot;.

==== Mers-el-Kébir ====
With the surrender of France on 22 June 1940, the bulk of the French fleet lay at Mers-el-Kébir. Since British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was very worried that the French ships might fall into the hands of the Germans and did not believe the Vichy government&#x27;s assurances that it would prevent the Germans from seizing the ships, he intended to give the French an ultimatum. On Wednesday, 3 July 1940, Force H under the command of Vice Admiral James Fownes Somerville consisting of the aircraft carrier &quot;Ark Royal,&quot; the battlecruiser &quot;Hood,&quot; the battleships &quot;Valiant,&quot; &quot;Resolution,&quot; and &quot;Nelson,&quot; and other cruisers and destroyers appeared off the harbor entrance. Somerville radioed Admiral Marcel Gensoul to inform him of the British demands. After the ultimatum expired, the &quot;Valiant&quot; opened fire along with the &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot;. The &quot;Dunkerque&quot;, the &quot;Provence&quot;, and the &quot;Brittany&quot; were hit and heavily damaged; the latter exploded and sank. After Somerville had ceased fire to give Gensoul another chance, he overlooked that the &quot;Strasbourg&quot; together with the five remaining destroyers had escaped into the open sea behind the thick smoke of the explosions. The &quot;Strasbourg&quot;, along with the destroyers &quot;Volta&quot;, &quot;Tigre&quot; and &quot;Le Terrible&quot;, reached Toulon on the evening of 4 July.
In September, &quot;Valiant&quot; joined the carrier HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; with the squadron at Alexandria. For the remainder of the year, she sailed security duties in the Mediterranean, primarily on fleet advances. On the night of 18–19 December, together with the &quot;Warspite&quot;, she shelled the Albanian port of Valona

==== Cape Matapan ====
With the help of an intercepted Luftwaffe radio message decoded by ULTRA, Admiral Cunningham learned that the Italians, under the command of Vice-Admiral Angelo Iachino, intended to attack the British fleet to distract them from transporting German troops to North Africa. After the Italians sortied in a convoy of 22 ships, including the battleship &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;, on 26 March, Cunningham brought all his ships into position, including the &quot;Barham&quot;. On 28 March, British cruisers encountered the Italian fleet but were forced to retreat by the . Cunningham then ordered an air attack. Multiple air strikes by &quot;Formidable&quot;″s Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers damaged the &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; and crippled the heavy cruiser . The &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; escaped westwards as darkness fell. 
Later that evening. Admiral Iachino ordered the two other heavy cruisers of the 1st Division to render assistance to &quot;Pola&quot; in the darkness. The Italian ships and the British arrived almost simultaneously at &quot;Pola&quot;″s location, but the Italians had almost no clue that the British were nearby. On the other hand, the British knew exactly where the Italians were, thanks to their radar-equipped ships. They opened fire at point-blank range and sank the and . During the battle, Midshipman Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh had been assigned to &quot;Valiant&quot; and controlled the battleship&#x27;s searchlights.

====Battle of Crete====
On 22/23 May 1941, &quot;Valiant&quot; operated off Crete, and was struck by two bombs.

====Mining at Alexandria====
On 19 December 1941, &quot;Valiant&quot; was seriously damaged by limpet mines placed by Italian frogmen of Decima Flottiglia MAS, who entered Alexandria harbor riding two-man &quot;human torpedoes&quot; (&quot;maiali&quot;). Her sister ship was also damaged. Lieutenant Durand de la Penne placed the mines on &quot;Valiant&quot;. The other two teams attached their mines and escaped, but de la Penne&#x27;s &quot;maiale&quot; broke down. De la Penne pushed the &quot;maiale&quot; under &quot;Valiant&quot; and left it on the bottom. Then he and his companion Corporal emerged and were captured. They were interrogated by Captain Charles Morgan, but told him nothing. A few minutes before the mines were scheduled to detonate, when it was too late to find and deactivate them, he informed Morgan of their existence (but not their location) to allow the crew on board to evacuate. They were kept in the locked compartment, which was (unbeknownst to them or Morgan) just above where the mine would explode. Both were injured by the explosion, but survived. The mine attached to &quot;Valiant&quot; was not actually in contact with her hull, so the damage was far less severe than to &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. Despite having a heavy trim forward, her decks were above water, and she remained clear of the harbour bottom. Although nearly immobilised, she was able, although only for a few days, to give the impression of full battle readiness, at least until she could be repaired. &quot;Valiant&quot; was repaired in Durban, South Africa, carrying out post-refit trials in July 1942, and took part in exercises with the Eastern Fleet the following month. At the end of August, &quot;Valiant&quot; took part in Operation Touchstone, an exercise to test East Africa&#x27;s defences against a seaborne invasion and to conduct a dress rehearsal for Operation Ironclad, the invasion of French Madagascar. She remained in African waters until the end of the year, and returned to Devonport for a refit in January 1943.

==== Sicily and Italy ====
 
On 17 June, &quot;Valiant&quot; departed Scapa Flow for Gibraltar along with the &quot;Nelson&quot;, &quot;Rodney&quot; and &quot;Warspite&quot;, joining Force H on arrival. Between 2 and 3 September, &quot;Valiant&quot; and &quot;Warspite&quot; covered the attack across the Strait of Messina and bombed the Italian coastal batteries at Reggio. She returned home for overhaul in October 1943. Upon completion on 1 December, &quot;Valiant&quot; was detached to the Eastern Fleet.

====Drydock accident in Ceylon====
In 1944, &quot;Valiant&quot; was sent to the Far East to join the Eastern Fleet. There she took part in raids against Japanese bases in Indonesia. On 8 August 1944, she was severely damaged in an accident with the floating drydock at Trincomalee, Ceylon. The drydock was being raised with &quot;Valiant&quot; in it by pumping water from ballast tanks. The tanks were emptied in the wrong sequence for &quot;Valiant&quot;″s weight distribution, which was exacerbated by her full munitions load. As a result, the drydock was over-stressed at its ends, broke its back and sank. &quot;Valiant&quot;″s two inner screws were jammed as well as one of her rudders. &quot;Valiant&quot; had remained in steam and was able to avoid worse damage or sinking. After the incident, the responsible Naval Constructor was disciplined.

=== Fate ===
It was decided to sail &quot;Valiant&quot; to Alexandria, where there were suitable docking facilities. However she could not steer a straight course, and could not make more than . She got as far as Suez Bay, but could not attempt the Suez Canal in that condition. Lt Cmdr Peter Keeble, an experienced diver and salvage expert, personally supervised the removal of her two inner screw shafts near the gland. The A-brackets holding the shafts and screws were also cut, dropping both screws and shafts to the bottom. Keeble had perfected available underwater cutting torches by combining British and Italian technology to cut away the thick propeller shafts. She returned to the UK and was decommissioned in July 1945. &quot;Valiant&quot; formed part of the &quot;Imperieuse&quot; stoker mechanics&#x27; training establishment at Devonport for the rest of her career. She was sold for scrap on 19 March 1948, and left Devonport for the breakers of Arnott Young at Cairnryan on 11 August of that year.

<doc id="485637" wikidata="Q598079" url="?curid=485637" title="HMS Barham (04)">
<text>HMS &quot;Barham&quot; was one of five s built for the Royal Navy during the early 1910s. Completed in 1915, she was often used as a flagship and participated in the Battle of Jutland during the First World War as part of the Grand Fleet. For the rest of the war, except for the inconclusive action of 19 August 1916, her service generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the ship was assigned to the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Home Fleets. &quot;Barham&quot; played a minor role in quelling the 1929 Palestine riots and the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. The ship was in the Mediterranean when the Second World War began in September 1939, on her voyage home three months later, she accidentally collided with and sank one of her escorting destroyers, .

She participated in the Battle of Dakar in mid-1940, where she damaged a Vichy French battleship and was slightly damaged in return. &quot;Barham&quot; was then transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she covered multiple Malta convoys. She helped to sink an Italian heavy cruiser and a destroyer during the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 and was damaged by German aircraft two months later during the evacuation of Crete. &quot;Barham&quot; was sunk off the Egyptian coast the following November by the with the loss of 862 crewmen, approximately two thirds of her crew.

== Design and description ==
The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class ships were designed to form a fast squadron for the fleet that was intended to operate against the leading ships of the opposing battleline. This required maximum offensive power and a speed several knots faster than any other battleship to allow them to defeat any type of ship.

&quot;Barham&quot; had a length overall of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She had a normal displacement of and displaced at deep load. She was powered by two sets of Brown-Curtis steam turbines, each driving two shafts using steam from 24 Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at and intended to reach a maximum speed of . During her abbreviated sea trials on 6 July 1916, &quot;Barham&quot; only reached a mean top speed of . The ship had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 1,016 officers and ratings in 1916.

===Armament and fire-control===
The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class was equipped with eight breech-loading (BL) Mk I guns in four twin-gun turrets, in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Twelve of the fourteen BL Mk XII guns were mounted in casemates along the broadside of the vessel amidships; the remaining pair were mounted on the forecastle deck near the aft funnel and were protected by gun shields. The anti-aircraft (AA) armament was composed of two quick-firing (QF) 20 cwt Mk I guns. The ships were fitted with four submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, two on each broadside.

&quot;Barham&quot; was completed with two fire-control directors fitted with rangefinders. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and the other was in the spotting top above the tripod mast. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by &#x27;B&#x27; turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in July 1917.

===Protection and aircraft===
The waterline belt of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class consisted of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick over the ships&#x27; vitals. The gun turrets were protected by of KC armour and were supported by barbettes thick. The ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from in thickness. The main conning tower was protected by of armour. After the Battle of Jutland, of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the magazines and additional anti-flash equipment was added in the magazines.

The ship was fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. During her early-1930s refit, the platforms were removed from the turrets and a retractable catapult was installed on the roof of &#x27;X&#x27; turret, along with a crane to recover a floatplane. This was initially a Fairey IIIF until it was replaced by a Fairey Swordfish in 1938.

=== Major alterations ===
&quot;Barham&quot; received a series of minor refits during the 1920s. In 1921–1922, rangefinders replaced the smaller ones in &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets. Two years later, her anti-aircraft defences were upgraded when the original three-inch AA guns were replaced with a pair of QF Mk V AA guns between November 1924 and January 1925 and another pair of four-inch AA guns were added from October to November later that year. To control these guns a temporary High-Angle Control Position was mounted above the torpedo-control tower aft. This was replaced by a torpedo rangefinder in early 1928 when the permanent position was installed in the remodelled spotting top.

The ship was extensively refitted between January 1931 and January 1934 at a cost of £424,000. During this refit, the aft superstructure was rebuilt and the torpedo-control tower and its rangefinder were removed, together with the aft set of torpedo tubes. The fore funnel was trunked into the aft funnel to reduce smoke in the spotting top. A High-Angle Control System (HACS) Mk I director were added to the roof of the spotting top and the mainmast was reconstructed as a tripod to support the weight of a second HACS director. A pair of octuple mounts for 2-pounder () Mk VIII &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft guns were added abreast the funnel and two positions for their directors were added on new platforms abreast and below the spotting top. In addition, a pair of quadruple mounts for Vickers AA machine guns were added abreast the conning tower.

The turret roofs were reinforced to a thickness of and the armour added over the magazines after Jutland was replaced by 4 inches of Krupp non-cemented armour, the first British battleship to receive such. In addition, the rear of the six-inch gun casemates was enclosed by a bulkhead. Underwater protection was improved by the addition of torpedo bulges. They were designed to reduce the effect of torpedo detonations and improve stability at the cost of widening the ship&#x27;s beam by almost to , and reduced her draught to . This increased her metacentric height to about at deep load, despite the increase in her deep displacement to . When &quot;Barham&quot; conducted her sea trials on 20 November 1933, her speed was reduced to from .

Later alterations included replacing the single mounts of the AA guns with twin mounts for the QF 4-inch Mark XVI gun, removal of the forward submerged torpedo tubes and the high-angle rangefinder in March–May 1938. In addition the torpedo-control tower aft was replaced by an air-defence position during that same refit. While under repair in December 1939March 1940, a 20-barrel Unrotated projectile (UP) rocket launcher was installed on the roof of &#x27;B&#x27; turret and her HACS Mk I directors were replaced with Mk III models. The following year the UP mount was replaced by a pair of quadruple Vickers 0.5-inch machine gun mounts and another pair of eight-barreled &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts were added abreast her conning tower.

==Construction and career==
The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class was ordered as part of the 1912 Naval Programme and the contract for &quot;Barham&quot; was awarded to John Brown &amp; Company. The ship, named after Admiral Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham, was laid down at their Clydebank shipyard on 24 February 1913 and launched on 31 December 1914. &quot;Barham&quot; cost a total of £2,470,113. She was completed for trials on 19 August 1915 which took until the end of September to finish under the command of Captain Arthur Craig Waller. The following day, 1 October, Rear-Admiral Hugh Evan-Thomas, commander of the 5th Battle Squadron, hoisted his flag aboard his new flagship.

===First World War===
&quot;Barham&quot; joined the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow the next day and participated in a fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November. During another training exercise in early December, the ship was accidentally rammed by her sister ship on 3 December. After temporary repairs at Scapa, &quot;Barham&quot; was sent to Cromarty Firth for more permanent repairs in the floating dry dock there that lasted until 23 December.

The Grand Fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Barham&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft. The 5th Battle Squadron preceded the rest of the Grand Fleet to reinforce Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s battlecruiser fleet, but the British arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea. On 21 May, the 5th Battle Squadron was attached to Beatty while his 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron was detached for gunnery training and arrived at Rosyth the following day.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, 6 light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats, departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. &quot;Barham&quot; slipped her mooring at 22:08 and was followed by the rest of Beatty&#x27;s ships.

When dawn broke Beatty ordered his forces into cruising formation with the 5th Battle Squadron trailing his battle cruisers by . At 14:15, Beatty ordered a turn north by east to rendezvous with the Grand Fleet. Shortly before the turn, one of his escorting light cruisers, spotted smoke on the horizon and continued on her course to investigate. Ten minutes later, the ship radioed &quot;Two cruisers, probably hostile, in sight...&quot; They were actually two German destroyers that had stopped to check a Danish merchant ship&#x27;s papers. At 14:32, Beatty ordered a course change to south-southeast in response to the spot report. &quot;Barham&quot;″s signallers were unable to read the signal and her officer of the watch presumed that it was the expected point zigzag to the left of the base course and signalled that course change to the rest of the squadron. After several minutes it became apparent that the squadron was not conforming to Beatty&#x27;s other ships, but Evan-Thomas refused to change course until clear instructions had been received despite entreaties from the &quot;Barham&quot;″s captain. While the exact time when Evan-Thomas ordered his ships to turn to follow Beatty is not known, the consensus is that it was about seven minutes later, which increased his distance from Beatty to nothing less than .

Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty&#x27;s ships did not see the Germans to their east until 15:30. Two minutes later, Beatty ordered a course change to east-southeast, positioning the British ships to cut off the German&#x27;s line of retreat, and signalled action stations. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, behind him. Beatty then altered course to the east, as he was still too far north to cut Hipper off. This was later characterised as the &quot;Run to the South&quot; as Beatty changed course to steer east-southeast at 15:45, now paralleling Hipper&#x27;s course less than away. By this time the 5th Battle Squadron was about northwest of Beatty. The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed by the British battlecruisers.

The light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group were the first German ships visible to Evan-Thomas&#x27;s ships and &quot;Barham&quot; opened fire on them at 15:58 until the cruisers disappeared into their own smoke screen at around 16:05. About three minutes later, the ship opened fire on the battlecruiser at a range of about . A minute later she scored one hit on the German ship&#x27;s stern before she was ordered to switch targets to the battlecruiser , together with her sister . The shell struck just below the waterline and burst on impact with the belt armour. The impact was right on the joints between several armour plates and drove them inwards and destroyed part of the hull behind them. The damage allowed over of water to flood the stern and nearly knocked out the ship&#x27;s steering gear. Between them, &quot;Barham&quot; and &quot;Valiant&quot; hit &quot;Moltke&quot; four times from 16:16 to 16:26, but only one of those hits can be attributed to &quot;Valiant&quot;. Two of the others detonated upon striking the waterline armour, but failed to penetrate. The impacts drove in the plates and fragments caused much flooding by damaging the surrounding structure. The last shell passed all the way through the ship without detonating; it struck and dislodged a armour plate on the waterline on the other side of the ship that caused also some flooding. &quot;Barham&quot; was herself was struck twice during the &quot;Run to the South&quot;: the first was a shell from &quot;von der Tann&quot; that failed to do any damage when it hit the waterline armour and the battlecruiser fired a shell that detonated in the aft superstructure. This sent splinters in every direction and started a small fire, but otherwise did no significant damage.

At 16:30, the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty&#x27;s ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet coming north at top speed. Three minutes later, she sighted the topmasts of Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer&#x27;s battleships, but did not report this for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting before ordering his force to turn north, towards the Grand Fleet in what came to be known as the &quot;Run to the North&quot;. His order only applied to his own forces; the 5th Battle Squadron continued south until after it passed Beatty heading northwestwards at 16:51. Beatty then ordered Evan-Thomas to turn his ships in succession to follow the battlecruisers three minutes later. This meant that they were some closer to the rapidly advancing High Sea Fleet. And now within range of the battleships of the 3rd Squadron which opened fire on the 5th Battle Squadron as they made their turn.

Evan-Thomas continued his turn until his ships were steering due north, which interposed the 5th Battle Squadron between Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers, which had reversed course around 16:48 to follow Beatty north, and Beatty&#x27;s ships. While making the turn, &quot;Barham&quot; was struck by two 30.5-centimetre shells beginning at 16:58, probably from the battlecruiser . The first of these struck the ship&#x27;s upper deck before detonating upon striking the main deck above the medical store compartment, which was completely burnt out. The detonation blew a hole in the main deck, sent fragments through the middle and lower decks and burned out the casemate for starboard No. 2 six-inch gun. Three minutes later another shell hit the aft superstructure, severing the antenna cables of the main wireless station. One fragment ricocheted off the upper deck and through the side plating on the opposite side of the ship. Either the first or the fourth of these shells destroyed the ship&#x27;s sickbay, killing the staff and all of its patients, including eight ship&#x27;s boys. &quot;Barham&quot; returned fire at the battlecruisers at 17:02, together with &quot;Valiant&quot;, the two northernmost of Evan-Thomas&#x27;s ships, and the two of them made three hits on the battlecruiser and &quot;Lützow&quot; between 17:06 and 17:13 while &quot;Barham&quot; was hit twice more by &quot;Derfflinger&quot;; although neither of the hits did any significant damage. In contrast, the hit on &quot;Lützow&quot; flooded a magazine and the hits on &quot;Seydlitz&quot; blew a hole in the side of her bow. Fragments from this hit caused flooding that spread throughout the bow, while the ship&#x27;s speed caused water to enter directly through the hole in the side. Other fragments from the second hit caused damage that allowed the water to spread even further. These two hits were ultimately responsible for the massive flooding that nearly sank &quot;Seydlitz&quot; after the battle. The third shell detonated on the face of the starboard wing turret, although some fragments entered the turret and caused minor damage.

Beatty in the meantime had turned further west to open up the range between his battered battlecruisers and the Germans. At 17:45 he turned eastwards to take his position in front of the Grand Fleet and re-engage Hipper&#x27;s ships. This meant that the 5th Battle Squadron and the light cruisers were the sole targets available for the German ships until after his turn, although the worsening visibility hampered both sides&#x27; shooting. &quot;Barham&quot; was not hit during this time and she and &quot;Valiant&quot;, later joined by their sister &quot;Warspite&quot;, continued to fire at Hipper&#x27;s 1st Scouting Group until 18:02 when &quot;Valiant&quot; lost sight of the Germans. They hit &quot;Lützow&quot;, &quot;Derfflinger&quot; and &quot;Seydlitz&quot; three times each between 17:19 and about 18:05. &quot;Lützow&quot; was only slightly damaged by these hits, which essentially only knocked out the primary and back-up wireless rooms while the shells that hit &quot;Derfflinger&quot; hit the side of the ship&#x27;s bow, knocking off several armour plates, while fragments opened holes that ultimately allowed roughly of water to enter the bow. One of these hits also started several major fires inside the hull. The hits on &quot;Seydlitz&quot; mostly opened up more holes that facilitated the flooding.

Hipper turned his ships southward around 18:05 to fall back upon Scheer&#x27;s advancing battleships and then reversed course five minutes later. Evan-Thomas turned northeast at around 18:06 and then made a slow turn to the southeast once he spotted the Grand Fleet. He first spotted the battleship , flagship of the 6th Division of the 1st Battle Squadron and thought she was leading the Grand Fleet as it deployed from cruising formation into line ahead. At 18:17 he realised that &quot;Marlborough&quot; was actually at the rear of the formation and he ordered a turn to the north to bring his squadron into line behind the Grand Fleet. This took some time and his ships had to slow down to to avoid overrunning the 6th Division and blocking its fire. The 5th Battle Squadron concentrated their fire on the German battleships after losing sight of the battlecruisers, with &quot;Barham&quot; opening fire at 18:14. No hits were observed and the ships stopped firing after making their turn north, but &quot;Barham&quot; opened fire for a short time when they fell in line with the Grand Fleet a few minutes later, probably without making any hits.

&quot;Barham&quot; fired 337 fifteen-inch shells and 25 six-inch shells during the battle. The number of hits cannot be confirmed, but it is believed that she and &quot;Valiant&quot; made 23 or 24 hits between them, making them two of the most accurate warships in the British fleet. She was hit six times during the battle, five times by 30.5 cm shells and once by a 28.3 cm shell, suffering casualties of 26 killed and 46 wounded.

====Subsequent activity====

Following Jutland, &quot;Barham&quot; was under repair until 5 July 1916. On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 that indicated that the High Seas Fleet, minus II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on 19 August, based on extensive reconnaissance conducted by Zeppelins and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnoughts and 6 battlecruisers while the Germans mustered 18 dreadnoughts and 2 battlecruisers. Throughout the next day, Jellicoe and Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, commander of the High Seas Fleet, received conflicting intelligence; after reaching the location in the North Sea where they expected to encounter the High Seas Fleet, the British turned north in the erroneous belief that they had entered a minefield. Scheer turned south again, then steered south-eastward to pursue a lone British battle squadron sighted by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers under Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans changed course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. The British and the German fleets returned home; the British lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and one German dreadnought had been torpedoed. After returning to port, Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and U-boats unless the odds of defeating the High Seas Fleet in a decisive engagement were favourable.

She was refitted at Cromarty between February and March 1917 and King George V inspected the ship on 22 June at Invergordon. &quot;Barham&quot; was refitted at Rosyth from 7–23 February 1918 and Waller was relieved by Captain Henry Buller on 18 April. The latter was succeeded by Captain Richard Horne on 1 October. She was present when the High Seas Fleet surrendered for internment on 21 November.

===Between the wars===

&quot;Barham&quot; became flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919, and made a port visit to Cherbourg, France that month together with the rest of the squadron. Captain Robin Dalglish relieved Horne on 1 October 1920. She retained her position when the 1st and 2nd Battle Squadrons were merged in May 1921. Dalglish was relieved in his turn by Captain Percy Noble on 18 October 1922. &quot;Barham&quot; participated in the Fleet review on 26 July 1924 at Spithead. A few months later, now under the command of Captain Richard Hill, the ship again retained her position as the 1st Battle Squadron was split in two and the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;s of the new 1st Battle Squadron were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet on 1 November 1924. On 14 October 1925, Captain Francis Marten relieved Hill, but he retained command only until 9 March 1926 when Captain Joseph Henley assumed command. Together with her sister , &quot;Barham&quot; was sent to Alexandria, Egypt, in May 1927 during a time of unrest. Now under the command of Captain Hubert Monroe and accompanied by the battleship , she cruised along the coast of West Africa from December 1927 to February 1928. She became a private ship in January of that year and was refitted at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard in February–July. Shortly after her return to the Mediterranean, &quot;Barham&quot; again became flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron in September after her sister &quot;Warspite&quot; had to return home for repairs after running aground. Captain James Somerville relieved Monroe on 1 December and he was relieved in his turn on 16 March 1929 by Captain John C. Hamilton. The ship was relieved as flagship by in June and she was ordered to Palestine in August where her crew helped to suppress rioting in Haifa and also operated the Haifa-Jerusalem railroad. The ship was transferred to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet in November 1929, and, together with &quot;Malaya&quot;, made a port visit to Trondheim, Norway in mid-1930 where they fired a salute to celebrate the birth of Princess Ragnhild on 9 June.

Between January 1931 and January 1934, &quot;Barham&quot; underwent a major refit. While &quot;Warspite&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot; and received what amounted to a complete reconstruction with new machinery and superstructures during the mid- to late-1930s, changes to &quot;Barham&quot; were relatively minor. Now under the command of Captain Richard Scott, &quot;Barham&quot; was assigned to the Home Fleet as the flagship of the 2nd Battle Squadron, and deployed to the West Indies in January–February 1935 for training. The ship participated in the Silver Jubilee Fleet Review for George V on 16 July at Spithead and was then transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of August. At that time, Captain Norman Wodehouse relieved Scott. She was briefly deployed to Haifa in May 1936 at the beginning of the Arab revolt in Palestine. Shortly afterwards, she was deployed to Gibraltar for several months after the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in July.

&quot;Barham&quot; served as the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron from November 1936 to May 1937 and participated in the Coronation Fleet Review for King George VI on 19 May at Spithead. She became the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet on 9 June until relieved by &quot;Warspite&quot; on 8 February 1938. Captain Henry Horan assumed command on 28 July 1937, although he only remained in command until 22 April 1938 when he was relieved by Captain Algernon Willis. The ship resumed her former role as flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron in February 1938 while undergoing a refit at Portsmouth that lasted until May. Willis was relieved by Captain Thomas Walker on 31 January 1939. During a port visit to Corfu in July, the ship was visited by King George II of Greece.

===Second World War===
&quot;Barham&quot; remained part of the Mediterranean Fleet at the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. She became a private ship on 1 December and departed Alexandria to join the Home Fleet that same day. On 12 December, she accidentally rammed one of her escorts, the destroyer , in thick fog west of the Mull of Kintyre. &quot;Duchess&quot; capsized and sank, with the loss of 124 of her crew.

&quot;Barham&quot;, the battlecruiser and the destroyers , , , and were on patrol off the Butt of Lewis to protect against a possible break-out into the Atlantic by German warships when they were spotted by the , commanded by Fritz-Julius Lemp, on 28 December. Lemp fired four torpedoes at the two capital ships, and one struck &quot;Barham&quot; on her port side, adjacent to the shell rooms for &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; turrets. The anti-torpedo bulge was essentially destroyed adjacent to the strike, with four men killed and two wounded. Most of the adjacent compartments flooded and the ship took on a 7 degree list that was countered by transferring fuel oil to starboard. &quot;Barham&quot;″s speed was initially reduced to , but it was increased to about an hour and a half later and she was able to proceed under her own power to Birkenhead for repairs by Cammell Laird that lasted until April 1940.
Captain Geoffrey Cooke assumed command on 25 March and the Navy took the opportunity to augment her light anti-aircraft armament and upgrade its directors. &quot;Barham&quot; played no role in the Norwegian Campaign although some of her crew and marines participated. In preparation for Operation Menace, a British naval attack on Dakar, Senegal, prior to a planned landing by the Free French, the ship was detached from the Home Fleet on 28 August and was assigned to Force M, the Royal Navy component of the operation. She departed Scapa Flow that day, escorted by four destroyers, and rendezvoused with the troop convoy en route to Gibraltar where she arrived on 2 September. She later became the flagship of Force M&#x27;s commander, Vice-Admiral John Cunningham. Reinforced by the battleship and the aircraft carrier from Force H, &quot;Barham&quot; departed Gibraltar for Freetown, Sierra Leone, four days later.

====Operation Menace====

Force M departed Freetown for Dakar on 21 September and had arrived Dakar before dawn two days later. After Free French emissaries were either captured or driven off by the Vichy French, Cunningham ordered his ships to open fire. &quot;Barham&quot;″s six-inch guns were the first to do so and fired at the on the surface. They claimed at least one hit and the submarine was finished off by two of the escorting destroyers and the light cruiser . Her main guns targeted the port and the battleship . Hindered by poor visibility, no significant damage was inflicted and &quot;Richelieu&quot; was not hit before the bombardment was called off after 20 minutes.

After the expiration of an ultimatum to surrender the following morning, the battleships engaged the port&#x27;s coast-defence guns and &quot;Richelieu&quot; at 09:30. The latter was only struck by a single shell splinter before the Allies broke off the bombardment at 10:07, although she had hit &quot;Barham&quot; once with a shell that blew a hole in diameter in the bulge. The sortied from the harbour at 12:00 to rescue a British pilot in the water, but was engaged at 12:53 by the battleships at a range of . The ship was not hit, but was forced to return to port under the cover of a heavy smoke screen. The British battleships then switched targets to bombard the harbour and &quot;Richelieu&quot;. They set several merchant ships on fire, but again failed to hit the latter at a range of before breaking off fire at 13:20. During this time &quot;Barham&quot; was struck by a 24 cm shell that penetrated through the superstructure before exploding with little effect and without causing any casualties. Another shell, probably also 24 cm in size (though possibly a 38 cm shell from Richelieu) detonated in the water on the starboard side abreast of the funnels. The resulting shockwave pushed the bulge inwards for a length of and it started to slowly flood.

After a conference aboard &quot;Barham&quot; later that day, the Allied commanders resolved to continue the attack. On the morning of 25 September, &quot;Richelieu&quot; was the first ship to open fire at 09:04 at a range of . As the British battleships were manoeuvring to take up their positions, the submarine fired a spread of four torpedoes at a range of . &quot;Barham&quot; was able to dodge them, but &quot;Resolution&quot; was struck by one torpedo amidships that caused a heavy list, and she fell out of line. &quot;Barham&quot; opened fire at a range of and hit &quot;Richelieu&quot; with one 15-inch shell at 09:15. The shell devastated a messdeck and dented the armoured deck by a depth of , but caused no casualties. The severe damage to &quot;Resolution&quot; caused Operation Menace to be abandoned and &quot;Barham&quot; had to tow her to Freetown for temporary repairs, before escorting a convoy to Gibraltar where she arrived on 15 October where her own damage was repaired. She was briefly assigned to Force H, before she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in November 1940.

&quot;Barham&quot;, two cruisers, and three destroyers also assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet were designated Force F as part of Operation Coat, one of a complex series of fleet movements in the Mediterranean. The battleship and the other ships of Force F were tasked to ferry troops to Malta, before continuing on to Alexandria. &quot;Barham&quot; was loaded with 600 troops, including the men of 12 Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, Force F departed Gibraltar on 7 November, escorted by Force H, rendezvoused with the main body of the Mediterranean Fleet three days later and unloaded their cargo at Malta later that day. While sailing eastwards, the aircraft carrier was detached from the main body to attack Taranto on the night of 11/12 November, damaging three Italian battleships. &quot;Barham&quot;, now assigned to the 1st BS, and &quot;Malaya&quot; were detached to refuel at Souda Bay, Crete, before sailing for Alexandria, reaching there on 14 November. As part of Operation Collar in late November, &quot;Barham&quot;, &quot;Malaya&quot; and the carrier covered the forces rendezvousing with a convoy coming from Gibraltar. En route, &quot;Eagle&quot;″s aircraft attacked Tripoli on 26 November. &quot;Barham&quot; became the flagship of the 1st BS in December.

===1941===

On 3 January 1941, the ship, together with &quot;Warspite&quot; and &quot;Valiant&quot;, bombarded Bardia as a prelude to the Battle of Bardia. On 26 March, the Italian fleet sortied in an attempt to intercept British convoys to Greece. The British had recently broken the Italian codes and sailed after dark on the 27th to intercept the Italians. The following morning, they were spotted by an aircraft from the carrier and the Battle of Cape Matapan began. Multiple air strikes by &quot;Formidable&quot;″s Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers damaged the battleship and crippled the heavy cruiser later that evening. Admiral Angelo Iachino, commander of the Italian fleet, ordered the two other heavy cruisers of the 1st Division to render assistance to &quot;Pola&quot; in the darkness. The Italian ships and the British arrived almost simultaneously at &quot;Pola&quot;″s location, but the Italians had almost no clue that the British were nearby. On the other hand, the British knew exactly where the Italians were, thanks to their radar-equipped ships. They opened fire at point-blank range, &quot;Barham&quot; crippling the destroyer and then joining &quot;Warspite&quot; and &quot;Valiant&quot; in crippling .

In mid-April she escorted the fast transport , together with &quot;Warspite&quot; and &quot;Valiant&quot;, from Alexandria to Malta before the battleships bombarded Tripoli on the evening of 20 April. On 612 May, she covered the Alexandria-Malta convoy of Operation Tiger. With her newly arrived sister &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, &quot;Barham&quot; escorted &quot;Formidable&quot; as her aircraft attacked the Italian airfield at Scarpanto at dawn on 26 May with some success. While covering the evacuation of Crete the following day, the ship was attacked by Junkers Ju 88 bombers from II./LG (Demonstration Wing) 1 and Heinkel He 111 bombers of II./KG (Bomber Wing) 26. One bomb struck &#x27;Y&#x27; turret and started a fire inside the turret that took 20 minutes to quench. A near miss ruptured her portside bulge over an area and caused a 1.5 degree list that was easily corrected by pumping oil. Casualties were five dead and six wounded. She reached Alexandria later that day, but she was too large for the floating dock there and had to be sent elsewhere for repairs. She sailed south through the Suez Canal to Mombasa, Kenya, where her damage was inspected. It proved to be worse than expected and &quot;Barham&quot; had to be repaired at Durban, South Africa, as she was unfit to make the trans-Atlantic crossing for repair in the United States. Repairs were completed six weeks later on 30 July and the ship returned to Alexandria in August where she resumed her role as flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron.

====Sinking====

On the afternoon of 24 November 1941, the 1st Battle Squadron, &quot;Barham&quot;, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, and &quot;Valiant&quot;, with an escort of eight destroyers, departed Alexandria to cover the 7th and 15th Cruiser Squadrons as they hunted for Italian convoys in the Central Mediterranean. The following morning, the , commanded by &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Hans-Diedrich von Tiesenhausen, detected the faint engine noises of the British ships and moved to intercept. By the afternoon the submarine and the 1st Battle Squadron were on reciprocal courses and Tiesenhausen ordered his boat to battle stations around 16:00. An ASDIC operator aboard one of the leading destroyers, , detected the submarine at 16:18 at an estimated range of , but the contact was disregarded as it subtended an angle between 40 and 60 degrees wide, far larger than a submarine. &quot;U-331&quot; thus passed through the screen and was in a position to fire her torpedoes after the leading ship, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, had passed her by and the second ship, &quot;Barham&quot;, was closing rapidly. Tiesenhausen ordered all four bow torpedo tubes fired at a range of at 16:25. Possibly due to her closeness to &quot;Valiant&quot;″s bow wave and discharging the torpedoes, the boat&#x27;s conning tower broached the surface and was fruitlessly engaged by one of the battleship&#x27;s &quot;pom-pom&quot;s at a range of about . The boat dived out of control after she broached, reaching an indicated depth of , well below her design depth rating of , before she stabilised without any damage. &quot;U-331&quot; was not attacked by the escorting destroyers and reached port on 3 December. Tiesenhausen was not certain of the results of his attack and radioed that he had hit a &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class battleship with one torpedo.

There was no time for evasive action, and three of the four torpedoes struck amidships so closely together as to throw up a single massive water column. &quot;Barham&quot; quickly capsized to port and was lying on her side when a massive magazine explosion occurred about four minutes after she was torpedoed and sank her. The Board of Enquiry into the sinking ascribed the final explosion to a fire in the 4-inch magazines outboard of the main 15-inch magazines, which would have then spread to and detonated the contents of the main magazines. Due to the speed at which she sank, 862 officers and ratings were killed, including two who died of their wounds after being rescued. The destroyer rescued 337 survivors, including Vice-Admiral Henry Pridham-Wippell and the pair who later died of their wounds, while the Australian destroyer reportedly rescued 150 men. Captain Geoffrey Cooke went down with his ship. The sinking was captured on film by a cameraman from Pathé News, aboard &quot;Valiant&quot;.

====Aftermath====
To conceal the sinking from the Germans and to protect British morale, the Board of Admiralty censored all news of &quot;Barham&quot;″s sinking. After a delay of several weeks the War Office notified the next of kin, but they added a special request for secrecy: the notification letters included a warning not to discuss the loss of the ship with anyone but close relatives, stating it was &quot;most essential that information of the event which led to the loss of your husband&#x27;s life should not find its way to the enemy until such time as it is announced officially...&quot; Following repeated claims by German radio, the Admiralty officially announced the loss on 27 January 1942 and explained that

It was not until the Admiralty admitted that &quot;Barham&quot; had been sunk and described the circumstances that Tiesenhausen knew that he had sunk her. He was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross that day. The &quot;Barham&#x27;s&quot; crew are commemorated by a memorial bench, located in Nothe Gardens, Weymouth.

Helen Duncan, considered the last person to be imprisoned under the Witchcraft Act 1735, came to the attention of the authorities after claiming to have contacted the spirit of a sailor of &quot;Barham&quot;, at the time when the ship&#x27;s sinking was being hidden from the general public.

<text>HMS &quot;Malaya&quot; was one of five &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class super-dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy during the 1910s. Shortly after commissioning in early 1916, she participated in the Battle of Jutland of the First World War as part of the Grand Fleet.

&quot;Malaya&quot; spent the interwar period between the Mediterranean Fleet, Atlantic Fleet, and Home Fleet. She transported Ottoman Sultan Mehmed VI into exile and served during the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Apart from this, her interwar career was uneventful.

With the outbreak of the Second World War, &quot;Malaya&quot; served with the Mediterranean Fleet, serving as a convoy escort and fighting in the Battle of Calabria and Operation Grog. In March 1941, she was transferred to the North Atlantic to perform convoy escort duties, during which she prevented the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau from attacking a convoy. Torpedoed in that month by the German submarine U-106, &quot;Malaya&quot; received repairs in New York. &quot;Malaya&quot; was withdrawn from serving at the end of 1944 and used as an accommodation ship for the training establishment HMS &quot;Vernon.&quot; She was ultimately broken up and sold for scrap in 1948.

== Design and description ==
The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class battleships were designed to form a fast squadron for the fleet that was intended to operate against the leading ships of the opposing battleline and prevent German battlecruisers from doing the same. This required maximum offensive power and a speed several knots faster than any other battleship to allow them to defeat any type of ship. As a result, the breech-loading (BL) 15-inch (381mm) Mk 1 gun was adopted, a significant upgrade from the 13.5-inch Mk V gun found on the preceding &quot;Iron Duke-&quot;class. A last-minute decision by the Admiralty led to the use of oil-fired boilers, increasing the speed of the ships.

&quot;Malaya&quot; had a length overall of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She had a normal displacement of and displaced at deep load. She was powered by two sets of Parsons steam turbines, rated at and driving two shafts using steam from 24 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Though the turbines were intended to reach a maximum speed of , in practice, was the fastest achievable. The ship had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 1,217 officers and ratings in 1919.

The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class was equipped with eight breech-loading (BL) Mk I guns in four twin-gun turrets, in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Twelve of the fourteen BL Mk XII guns were mounted in casemates along the broadside of the vessel amidships; the remaining pair were mounted on the forecastle deck near the aft funnel and were protected by gun shields. The anti-aircraft (AA) armament were composed of two quick-firing (QF) 20 cwt Mk I guns. The ships were fitted with four submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, two on each broadside.

&quot;Malaya&quot; was completed with two fire-control directors fitted with rangefinders. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and the other was in the spotting top above the tripod foremast. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by &#x27;B&#x27; turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in April 1917.

The waterline belt of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class consisted of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick over the ships&#x27; vitals. The gun turrets were protected by of KC armour and were supported by barbettes thick. The ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from in thickness. The main conning tower was protected by 13 inches of armour. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the magazines and additional anti-flash equipment was added in the magazines.

The ship was fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. Exactly when the platforms were removed is unknown, but no later than &quot;Malaya&quot;″s 1934–1936 reconstruction.

=== Major Alterations ===
During her first post-war refit in 1924, &quot;Malaya&quot; saw the removal of her 3-inch guns and mainmast searchlight platforms and addition of 4-inch high-angle guns. A refit in 1926 added another pair of 4-inch guns, the HACS anti-aircraft fire control system, a new fore-top, a stump fore-topmast, and re-positioned the 15-inch gunnery director. A short-range wireless-transmitting set was added either during this refit or earlier.

During her first major refit from 1927–1929, &quot;Malaya&quot; received modified anti-torpedo bulges, collective protection, and water protection. A torpedo-control position and an HACS Mk I director were added. She received new storage facilities for aviation fuel, and improved storage for 6-inch ammunition. The ship&#x27;s bridgework was modified, its stump fore-mast removed, and its funnels were amalgamated or &quot;trunked&quot;. These modifications led her to share a similar appearance with HMS &quot;Warspite&quot;.

The two stern submerged torpedo tubes were removed in 1931.

&quot;Malaya&quot; underwent a more extensive refit from 1934–1936. Armour protection over her deck, magazines, and machinery spaces was improved, and the armoured conning-tower was replaced by a smaller one. The single 4-inch high-angle guns were replaced by four twin-gun mounts for 4-inch Mk XIX guns, and two 2-pounder (40 mm (1.6 in)) Mk VIII &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts and four Vickers 0.5 in (12.7 mm) AA machineguns were added. The installation of the pom-pom director led the 6-inch director to be repositioned. The bow torpedo tubes were removed, and an aircraft catapult and aircraft hangar were fitted. A run after this refit achieved Malaya&#x27;s top speed of .

After being torpedoed by U-106 in March 1941, a damage refit in Brooklyn Naval Yard added offices and mounting positions for a pair of Type 281 early-warning radars, a pair of Type 285 anti-aircraft radars, a Type 284 rangefinding radar, and several Type 282 pom-pom directors. The radars themselves were added in a July 1941 refit in the United Kingdom, which also removed the 0.5-inch machine gun mountings and added eleven single 20-mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannon.

A 1942 refit removed the aircraft catapult and added a pair of twin 4-inch guns, a pair of 20-mm Oerlikons, and a pair of eight-barrelled pom-pom mounts, as well as a Type 273 surface search radar. To save space for the equipment added as well as the personnel required to man them, &quot;Malaya&quot;″s 6-inch guns were removed in 1943 and plated over, with twenty-two more single 20-mm Oerlikons added. A final refit in 1944 added eight single 20-mm Oerlikons, upgraded the radars, and added a Type 650 missile-jamming device.

==Construction and career==
===First World War===
&quot;Malaya&quot; was built by Sir W. G. Armstrong Whitworth and Company at High Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, and launched in March 1915. She was named in honour of the Federated Malay States in British Malaya, whose government paid for her construction.

&quot;Malaya&quot; served in Rear-Admiral Hugh Evan-Thomas&#x27;s 5th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet. She took part in the Battle of Jutland, on 31 May 1916. She first engaged the German battlecruisers and targeted the battlecruiser SMS &quot;Seydlitz&quot;, scoring numerous hits with her 15-inch (381 mm) main guns. As the German battleline intercepted the 5th Battle Squadron, Malaya was hit by seven 12-inch (305 mm) shells from multiple German battleships. As 5th Battle Squadron retreated to join the rest of the Grand Fleet, she was hit by an additional battleship sized projectile for a total of eight hits, taking major damage and heavy crew casualties. A total of 65 men died, either in the battle or later due to their injuries. However, her armour held up, surviving nowhere near critical condition. Among the wounded was Able Seaman Willie Vicarage, notable as one of the first men to receive facial reconstruction using plastic surgery and the first to receive radical reconstruction via the &quot;tubed pedicule&quot; technique pioneered by Sir Harold Gillies. Uniquely among the ships at the battle, HMS &quot;Malaya&quot; flew the red-white-black-yellow ensign of the Federated Malay States.

Other than Jutland, and the inconclusive Action of 19 August, her service during the First World War mostly consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

===Between the wars===
On 17 November 1922 &quot;Malaya&quot; carried the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Mehmed VI, from Istanbul into exile on Malta. In August–September 1938 she served in the port of Haifa during the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine.

===Second World War===

&quot;Malaya&quot; served in the Mediterranean in 1940, escorting convoys and operating against the Italian fleet.

&quot;Malaya&quot;&#x27;s second big action of her career, and her first of World War II, was the Battle of Calabria, on 9 June 1940. British forces engaged an Italian fleet, including the battleships and . &quot;Malaya&quot; fired several main battery rounds against the Italians while under fire from &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot;. Through her actions, &quot;Malaya&quot; helped to chase off all of the Italian warships with no damage received or hits scored, though most of the heavy lifting was carried out by her sister ship &quot;Warspite&quot;.

She shelled Genoa in February 1941 as part of Operation Grog but due to a crew error, fired a 15-inch armour-piercing shell into the south-east corner of the nave of Genoa Cathedral. The shell failed to detonate.

On 7 March 1941, while escorting convoy SL 67, &quot;Malaya&quot; encountered the German capital ships and that were conducting the Operation Berlin raid which targeted Allied convoys. By her presence she forced them to withdraw, although a U-boat attack aiming to sink &quot;Malaya&quot; inflicted some damage on the convoy.

Later that month &quot;Malaya&quot; was escorting convoy SL 68. On the evening of 20 March 1941, about 250 miles west-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands, &quot;Malaya&quot; was hit by a torpedo from . Damaged on the port side, and with a 7 degree list due to flooding, Malaya was forced to leave the convoy and make for port, escorted by the corvette . She reached Trinidad safely on 29 March. After temporary repairs were made, she continued to the New York Navy Yard, where she was docked for four months. During that time, personnel from the ship ferried ten s to Britain.

On 9 July, under the command of Captain Cuthbert Coppinger, &quot;Malaya&quot; left New York on trials and steamed to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to provide protection for an urgent fast convoy. No ships were lost, and &quot;Malaya&quot; arrived in Rosyth on 28 July. Thereafter she escorted convoys from the United Kingdom to Malta and Cape Town until summer 1943.

&quot;Malaya&quot; was placed in reserve at the end of 1943. At this time her entire secondary 6-inch armament was removed and her anti-aircraft armament was enhanced. Between 15 and 17 May 1944, &quot;Malaya&quot; was used in Loch Striven as a target ship for inert &quot;Highball&quot; bouncing bomb prototypes, one of which punched a hole in the ship&#x27;s side. She was reactivated just before the Normandy landings to act as a reserve bombardment battleship.

===Fate===
&quot;Malaya&quot; was finally withdrawn from all service at the end of 1944 and became an accommodation ship for a torpedo school. Sold on 20 February 1948 to Metal Industries, Limited she arrived at Faslane on 12 April 1948 for scrapping. The first watch bell was refitted and presented to the Perak Council in Malaya, and was hung in the Council Chamber. The furthermost bell is located in the East India Club, and the second watch bell was handed to the Victoria Institution on 12 September 1947, before being handed over to the Royal Malaysian Navy in 2007.
