<text>Susanna Verbruggen (née Percival) (–1703), aka Susanna Mountfort, was an English actress working in London.

==Life==
She was the daughter of Thomas Percival, a member of the Duke&#x27;s Company for more than a decade. Her first recorded stage appearance may have been as early as 1681 in D&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s &quot;Sir Barnaby Whigg&quot;. In 1686 she married the actor William Mountfort, and after Mountfort&#x27;s infamous murder in 1692, she married the actor John Verbruggen.

She was a successful and popular comedian, known especially for her breeches roles. Her greatest success was as the main character Lucia in Thomas Southerne&#x27;s &quot;Sir Anthony Love&quot;, where Lucia partakes of the freedom of the roistering Restoration rake by disguising herself as &quot;Sir Anthony&quot;. Both men and women in the audience loved her performance in these types of roles.

She was one of the leading actresses at the United Company, but when the company split in two in 1695 (see Restoration comedy) she was, however, not offered a share in the actors&#x27; cooperative, but merely a salary. This may have been the biggest tactical mistake the actors&#x27; company made: both the Verbruggens were dissatisfied with the offer, reasonably so since Susanna was extremely versatile and popular with audiences, and returned to the parent company, thereby substantially improving its odds in the competition between the companies (see The Relapse).

Her daughter (also named Susanna Mountfort (1690-1720) was an actress at Drury Lane, beginning her career in 1703.

<doc id="468887" wikidata="Q2703374" url="?curid=468887" title="Mozilla Composer">
<text>Mozilla Composer is the former free and open-source HTML editor and web authoring module of the Mozilla Application Suite (the predecessor to SeaMonkey). It was used to create and to edit web pages, e-mail, and text documents, and available for Windows, macOS and Linux. Composer was a graphical WYSIWYG HTML editor to view, write and edit HTML source code.

In September 2008 Daniel Glazman announced a new WYSIWYG HTML editor, BlueGriffon, written from scratch and based on Mozilla Gecko and XULRunner.

SeaMonkey, the community-driven successor to Mozilla Suite, includes an HTML editor named Composer that is developed from the Mozilla Composer code contained in the original Mozilla Suite.

==Nvu==
Nvu (pronounced &quot;N-view&quot;) is a WYSIWYG HTML editor, based on Mozilla Composer. It is intended to be an open-source alternative to proprietary software like Microsoft Expression Web and Adobe Dreamweaver. As a WYSIWYG editor, it is designed to be easy for novice users, and does not require any knowledge of HTML or CSS to use. It runs on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux and incorporates Cascading Style Sheets support and other improvements from software company Disruptive Innovations. Nvu was the brainchild of Kevin Carmony, CEO for Linspire, who wanted an easy-to-use, WYSIWYG HTML editor for Linux users. Under Carmony&#x27;s direction, Linspire started and sponsored Nvu, hiring Daniel Glazman, former Netscape Communications Corporation employee, to be the lead developer.

===Development===
The original plan in June 2005 was to merge back the numerous changes into Mozilla Composer&#x27;s source code tree. Since then the Mozilla Suite has been discontinued (then reintroduced as SeaMonkey), and no one has merged the Nvu code back into Composer.

===Standards compliance===

Nvu complies with the W3C&#x27;s web standards. By default, pages are created in accordance to HTML 4.01 Transitional and use CSS for styling, but the user can change the settings and choose between:
* Strict and transitional DTD&#x27;s

===Shift to KompoZer===
Daniel Glazman, the lead developer of Nvu, announced on September 15, 2006, that he had stopped official development on Nvu and that he was developing a successor as a Mozilla.org project. It is written from scratch and based on Mozilla trunk Gecko 1.9 and XULRunner. PHP and CSS would be supported. A community-driven fork, KompoZer, maintains Nvu codebase and fixes bugs until a successor to Nvu is released. Glazman&#x27;s project is called BlueGriffon.

==KompoZer==

KompoZer is a discontinued open source WYSIWYG HTML editor based on the Nvu. KompoZer was forked as a community-driven project with development coordinated through SourceForge.

KompoZer&#x27;s WYSIWYG editing capabilities are one of the main attractions of the software. In addition, KompoZer allows direct code editing as well as a split code-graphic view.

The most recent version is KompoZer 0.8 beta 3, released February 2010, using Gecko 1.8.1. The stable version was 0.7.10, released in August 2007. The only regular developer said in June 2011 that development &quot;is stalled at the moment&quot;.

As a 32-bit application, it is no longer supported on macOS Catalina and later versions.

===Standards compliance===
KompoZer complies with the W3C&#x27;s web standards. By default, pages are created in accordance to HTML 4.01 Strict and use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling, but the user can change the settings and choose between:
* Strict and transitional DTD&#x27;s
* HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0
* CSS styling or the old codice_1 based styling.

The application can call on the W3C HTML validator, which uploads pages to the W3C Markup Validation Service and checks for compliance.

<text>William Mountfort (c. 1664 – 10 December 1692), English actor and dramatic writer, was the son of a Staffordshire gentleman. He met his death at the hand of notorious brawler Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun of Okehampton, who had just taken part in an attempted kidnap of Mountfort&#x27;s friend, the actress Anne Bracegirdle.

==Biography==
By 1678 Mountfort had travelled to London, where his first stage appearance was with the Dorset Garden Theatre company, taking the part of a boy in &quot;The Counterfeits&quot;. By 1682 he was taking important roles, usually those of the fine gentleman, and he came to be considered a major talent. Mountfort wrote a number of plays, wholly or in part, and many prologues and epilogues. In 1686 he married the actress Susanna Percival.

Owing to jealousy of Anne Bracegirdle&#x27;s supposed interest in Mountfort, Captain Richard Hill, an adventurer, who had annoyed her with persistent attentions, accompanied by Charles Mohun, ambushed Mountfort in Howard Street, Strand, on 9 December 1692. During the struggle Mountfort was stabbed in the chest by Hill, and he died of his wounds the following day. Following the attack Hill fled to Scotland. Lord Mohun was tried by his peers in the House of Lords. Evidence was given as to the peer&#x27;s good character and, controversially, he was acquitted.

The bell of St Clement&#x27;s Church is reputed to have cracked when tolled at Mountfort&#x27;s funeral. His daughter Susanna Mountfort became an actor at Drury Lane. A novel &quot;The player&#x27;s tragedy. Or, Fatal love&quot;, a fictionalized version of the event, appeared in 1693.

==Works==
An anthology of his plays, entitled &quot;Six Plays&quot;, was published by J. Tonson, G. Strahan and William Mears in two volumes (1719–20) accompanied by a preface consisting of some memoirs of his life. The plays were:
* &quot;The Injured Lovers&quot; (1688)
* &quot;The Successful Strangers&quot; (1690)
* &quot;Greenwich Park&quot; (1691)
* &quot;King Edward the Third , with the Fall of Mortimer Earl of March&quot; (generally attributed to John Bancroft)
* &quot;The life and death of Dr. Faustus&quot;
* &quot;Henry the Second, King of England, with the Death of Rosamond&quot; (1692) (also attributed to John Bancroft)
It is believed that his 1705 play &quot;Zelmane: Or, The Corinthian Queen: A Tragedy. As it is Acted at the New-theatre in Lincolns-Inn-Fields&quot; has the first appearance of the expression, &quot;Be still my beating heart.&quot;

<doc id="468892" wikidata="Q1153200" url="?curid=468892" title="Fisher equation">
<text>In financial mathematics and economics, the Fisher equation expresses the relationship between nominal interest rates, real interest rates, and inflation. Named after Irving Fisher, an American economist, it can be expressed as real interest rate ≈ nominal interest rate − inflation rate. 

In more formal terms, where formula_1 equals the real interest rate, formula_2 equals the nominal interest rate, and formula_3 equals the inflation rate, then formula_4. The approximation of formula_5 is often used instead since the nominal interest rate, real interest rate, and inflation rate are usually close to zero. 

==Applications==

===Borrowing, lending and the time value of money===
When loans are made, the amount borrowed and the repayments due to the lender are normally stated in nominal terms, before inflation. However, when inflation occurs, a dollar repaid in the future is worth less than a dollar borrowed today. To calculate the true economics of the loan, it is necessary to adjust the nominal cash flows to account for future inflation.

===Inflation-indexed bonds===
The Fisher equation can be used in the analysis of bonds. The real return on a bond is roughly equivalent to the nominal interest rate minus the expected inflation rate. But if actual inflation exceeds expected inflation during the life of the bond, the bondholder&#x27;s real return will suffer. This risk is one of the reasons inflation-indexed bonds such as U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities were created to eliminate inflation uncertainty. Holders of indexed bonds are assured that the real cash flow of the bond (principal plus interest) will not be affected by inflation.

===Cost–benefit analysis===
As detailed by Steve Hanke, Philip Carver, and Paul Bugg (1975), cost benefit analysis can be greatly distorted if the exact Fisher equation is not applied. Prices and interest rates must both be projected in either real or nominal terms.

===Monetary policy===
The Fisher equation plays a key role in the Fisher hypothesis, which asserts that the real interest rate is unaffected by monetary policy and hence unaffected by the expected inflation rate. With a fixed real interest rate, a given percent change in the expected inflation rate will, according to the equation, necessarily be met with an equal percent change in the nominal interest rate in the same direction.

<doc id="468893" wikidata="Q4684655" url="?curid=468893" title="Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing">
<text>Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T) is a system for defining and communicating engineering tolerances via a symbolic language on engineering drawings and computer-generated 3D models that describes a physical object&#x27;s nominal geometry and the permissible variation thereof. GD&amp;T is used to define the nominal (theoretically perfect) geometry of parts and assemblies, the allowable variation in size, form, orientation, and location of individual features, and how features may vary in relation to one another such that a component is considered satisfactory for its intended use. Dimensional specifications define the nominal, as-modeled or as-intended geometry, while tolerance specifications define the allowable physical variation of individual features of a part or assembly.

There are several standards available worldwide that describe the symbols and define the rules used in GD&amp;T. One such standard is American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Y14.5. This article is based on that standard. Other standards, such as those from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) describe a different system which has some nuanced differences in its interpretation and rules (see GPS&amp;V). The Y14.5 standard provides a fairly complete set of rules for GD&amp;T in one document. The ISO standards, in comparison, typically only address a single topic at a time. There are separate standards that provide the details for each of the major symbols and topics below (e.g. position, flatness, profile, etc.). BS 8888 provides a self-contained document taking into account a lot of GPS&amp;V standards.

== Origin ==
The origin of GD&amp;T is credited to Stanley Parker, who developed the concept of &quot;true position&quot;. While little is known about Parker&#x27;s life, it is known that he worked at the Royal Torpedo Factory in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, Scotland. His work increased production of naval weapons by new contractors.

In 1940, Parker published &quot;Notes on Design and Inspection of Mass Production Engineering Work&quot;, the earliest work on geometric dimensioning and tolerancing. In 1956, Parker published &quot;Drawings and Dimensions&quot;, which became the basic reference in the field.

== Fundamental concepts ==

=== Dimensions ===
A dimension is defined in ASME Y14.5 as &quot;a numerical value(s) or mathematical expression in appropriate units of measure used to define the form, size, orientation, or location, of a part or feature.&quot; Special types of dimensions include &quot;basic dimensions&quot; (theoretically exact dimensions) and &quot;reference dimensions&quot; (dimensions used to inform, not define a feature or part).

=== Units of measure ===
The units of measure in a drawing that follows GD&amp;T can be selected by the creator of the drawing. Most often drawings are standardized to either SI linear units, millimeters (denoted &quot;mm&quot;), or US customary linear units, decimal inches (denoted &quot;IN&quot;). Dimensions can contain only a number without units if all dimensions are the same units and there is a note on the drawing that clearly specifies what the units are.

Angular dimensions can be expressed in decimal degrees or degrees, minutes, and seconds.

=== Tolerances ===
Every feature on every manufactured part is subject to variation, therefore, the limits of allowable variation must be specified. Tolerances can be expressed directly on a dimension by limits, plus/minus tolerances, or geometric tolerances, or indirectly in tolerance blocks, notes, or tables.

Geometric tolerances are described by &quot;feature control frames,&quot; which are rectangular boxes on a drawing that indicate the type of geometric control, tolerance value, modifier(s) and/or datum(s) relevant to the feature&quot;.&quot; The type of tolerances used with symbols in feature control frames can be:

# equal bilateral
# unequal bilateral
# unilateral
# no particular distribution (a &quot;floating&quot; zone)

Tolerances for the profile symbols are equal bilateral unless otherwise specified, and for the position symbol tolerances are always equal bilateral. For example, the position of a hole has a tolerance of .020 inches. This means the hole can move ±.010 inches, which is an equal bilateral tolerance. It does not mean the hole can move +.015/−.005 inches, which is an unequal bilateral tolerance. Unequal bilateral and unilateral tolerances for profile are specified by adding further information to clearly show this is what is required.

=== Datums and datum references ===

A &quot;datum&quot; is a theoretically exact plane, line, point, or axis. A &quot;datum feature&quot; is a physical feature of a part identified by a &quot;datum feature symbol&quot; and corresponding &quot;datum feature triangle&quot;, e.g.,

:formula_1

These are then referred to by one or more &#x27;datum references&#x27; which indicate measurements that should be made with respect to the corresponding datum feature. The datum reference frame can describe how the part fits or functions.

== Purpose and rules ==
The purpose of GD&amp;T is to describe the engineering intent of parts and assemblies. GD&amp;T can more accurately define the dimensional requirements for a part, allowing over 50% more tolerance zone than coordinate (or linear) dimensioning in some cases. Proper application of GD&amp;T will ensure that the part defined on the drawing has the desired form, fit (within limits) and function with the largest possible tolerances. GD&amp;T can add quality and reduce cost at the same time through producibility.

According to ASME Y14.5, the fundamental rules of GD&amp;T are as follows,

# All dimensions must have a tolerance. Plus and minus tolerances may be applied directly to dimensions or applied from a general tolerance block or general note. For basic dimensions, geometric tolerances are indirectly applied in a related feature control frame. The only exceptions are for dimensions marked as minimum, maximum, stock or reference.
# Dimensions and tolerancing shall fully define each feature. Measurement directly from the drawing or assuming dimensions is not allowed except for special undimensioned drawings.
# A drawing should have the minimum number of dimensions required to fully define the end product. The use of reference dimensions should be minimized.
# Dimensions should be applied to features and arranged to represent the function and mating relationship of the part. There should only be one way to interpret dimensions.
# Part geometry should be defined without explicitly specifying manufacturing methods.
# If dimensions are required during manufacturing but not the final geometry (due to shrinkage or other causes) they should be marked as &quot;non-mandatory&quot;.
# Dimensions should be arranged for maximum readability and should be applied to visible lines in true profiles.
# When geometry is normally controlled by gage sizes or by code (e.g. stock materials), the dimension(s) shall be included with the gage or code number in parentheses following the dimension.
# Angles of 90° are assumed when lines (including center lines) are shown at right angles, but no angle is specified.
# Basic 90° angles are assumed where center lines of features in a pattern or surfaces shown at right angles on a 2D orthographic drawing are located or defined by basic dimensions and no angle is specified.
# A basic dimension of zero is assumed where axes, center planes, or surfaces are shown coincident on a drawing, and the relationship between features is defined by geometric tolerances.
# Dimensions and tolerances are valid at and unless stated otherwise.
# Unless explicitly stated, dimensions and tolerances only apply in a free-state condition.
# Unless explicitly stated, tolerances apply to the full length, width, and depth of a feature.
# Dimensions and tolerances only apply at the level of the drawing where specified. It is not mandatory that they apply at other levels (such as an assembly drawing).
# Coordinate systems shown on drawings should be right-handed. Each axis should be labeled and the positive direction should be shown.

=== List of geometric characteristics ===

=== List of modifiers ===
The following table shows only some of the more commonly used modifiers in GD&amp;T. It is not an exhaustive list.
== Certification ==
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) provides two levels of certification:

*Technologist GDTP, which provides an assessment of an individual&#x27;s ability to understand drawings that have been prepared using the language of Geometric Dimensioning &amp; Tolerancing.
*Senior GDTP, which provides the additional measure of an individual&#x27;s ability to select proper geometric controls as well as to properly apply them to drawings.

==Data exchange==
Exchange of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T) information between CAD systems is available on different levels of fidelity for different purposes:
* In the early days of CAD, exchange-only lines, texts and symbols were written into the exchange file. A receiving system could display them on the screen or print them out, but only a human could interpret them.
* &quot;GD&amp;T presentation&quot;: On a next higher level the presentation information is enhanced by grouping them together into &quot;callouts&quot; for a particular purpose, e.g. a &quot;datum feature callout&quot; and a &quot;datum reference frame&quot;. And there is also the information which of the curves in the file are leader, projection or dimension curves and which are used to form the shape of a product.
* &quot;GD&amp;T representation&quot;: Unlike GD&amp;T presentation, the GD&amp;T representation does not deal with how the information is presented to the user but only deals with which element of a shape of a product has which GD&amp;T characteristic. A system supporting GD&amp;T representation may display GD&amp;T information in some tree and other dialogs and allow the user to directly select and highlight the corresponding feature on the shape of the product, 2D and 3D.
* Ideally both GD&amp;T presentation and representation are available in the exchange file and are associated with each other. Then a receiving system can allow a user to select a GD&amp;T callout and get the corresponding feature highlighted on the shape of the product.
* An enhancement of GD&amp;T representation is defining a formal language for GD&amp;T (similar to a programming language) which also has built-in rules and restrictions for the proper GD&amp;T usage. This is still a research area (see below reference to McCaleb and ISO 10303-1666).
* &quot;GD&amp;T validation&quot;: Based on GD&amp;T representation data (but not on GD&amp;T presentation) and the shape of a product in some useful format (e.g. a boundary representation), it is possible to validate the completeness and consistency of the GD&amp;T information. The software tool FBTol from the Kansas City Plant is probably the first one in this area.
* GD&amp;T representation information can also be used for the software assisted manufacturing planning and cost calculation of parts. See ISO 10303-224 and 238 below.

<doc id="468898" wikidata="Q6969027" url="?curid=468898" title="Nathan Drake (essayist)">
<text>Nathan Drake (15 January 1766 – 7 June 1836), English essayist and physician, was born in York, at the family home in Precentor&#x27;s Court, as the son of Nathan Drake, an artist. He is known for a book summing up knowledge of Shakespeare available at the time.

==Biography==
Drake was apprenticed to a doctor in York in 1780, and in 1786 proceeded to Edinburgh University, where he took his degree as MD in 1789. In 1790 he set up as a general practitioner at Sudbury, Suffolk, where he became an intimate friend with John Mason Good (died 1827). In 1792, Drake relocated to Hadleigh, where he died in 1836.

==Bibliography==
Drake&#x27;s works include several volumes of literary essays and some papers contributed to medical periodicals.

However, Drake&#x27;s prime work was &quot;Shaksperiana: or, Sketches of Shakespeare&#x27;s character and genius... Now first collected... by Nathan Drake, etc.&quot;, i. e. &quot;Shakespeare and his Times, including the Biography of the Poet, Criticisms on his Genius, and Writings; a new Chronology of his Plays; a Disquisition on the Object of his Sonnets; and a History of the Manners, Customs and Amusements, Superstitions, Poetry and Elegant Literature of his Age&quot;, 2 vols, 1817. The titles of its editions give the scope of this ample study, which has the merit, says G. G. Gervinus, &quot;of having brought together for the first time into a whole the tedious and scattered material of the editions and the many other valuable labours of Tyrwhitt, Heath, Ritson, etc.&quot; on Shakespeare.

An important medical work of Drake&#x27;s is &quot;On the Use of Digitalis in Consumption&quot; (five papers published in the &quot;Medical and Physical Journal&quot;, London, 1799–1800). His &quot;Literary Hours&quot; (1798) were highly popular early in the 19th century (4th ed., 1820). Drake is also credited with discovering the merits of the poet Henry Neele.

<doc id="468899" wikidata="Q203927" url="?curid=468899" title="Patrick Bateman">
<text>Patrick Bateman is a fictional character created by novelist Bret Easton Ellis. He is the villain protagonist and unreliable narrator of Ellis&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;American Psycho&quot; and is played by Christian Bale in the 2000 film adaptation of the same name. Bateman is a wealthy and materialistic yuppie and Wall Street investment banker who, supposedly, leads a secret life as a serial killer. He has also briefly appeared in other Ellis novels and their film and theatrical adaptations.

While initially gaining attention upon the novel&#x27;s release, Bateman&#x27;s influence expanded among Gen Z. The film&#x27;s cult following among young viewers propelled Bateman into the realm of a cultural icon. The rise of internet culture and social media platforms has propelled Bateman&#x27;s character into the realm of memetic culture. Memes featuring Bateman&#x27;s iconic quotes, facial expressions, and memorable scenes have proliferated across various online communities, further cementing his status as a cultural touchstone.

==Biography and profile==
At the beginning of &quot;American Psycho&quot;, Bateman is a 27-year-old successful specialist in mergers and acquisitions with the fictitious Wall Street investment firm of Pierce &amp; Pierce (also Sherman McCoy&#x27;s firm in &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;). He lives at 55 West 81st Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, on the 11th floor of the American Gardens Building, where he is a neighbor of actor Tom Cruise. In his secret life, Bateman is, or hallucinates to be, a serial killer, murdering a variety of people, including colleagues, the homeless, and prostitutes. His crimes, including rape, torture, necrophilia, and cannibalism, are graphically described in the novel.

Bateman was born on 23 October 1961 and comes from a wealthy family. His parents have a house on Long Island, and he mentions a summer house in Newport. His parents divorced sometime earlier, while his mother became sick and now resides at a sanatorium. His father, who first appeared in Ellis&#x27;s preceding novel &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;, grew up on an estate in Connecticut, and now owns an apartment in the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan. He is assumed to be dead as he is mentioned only in the past tense during the novel.

In Mary Harron&#x27;s 2000 adaptation, however, it is mentioned that Bateman&#x27;s father &quot;practically owns&quot; the company that Bateman works at, implying that Bateman&#x27;s father is still alive. Bateman&#x27;s younger brother Sean attends Camden College and is a protagonist of &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;, in which Patrick Bateman was first introduced. Bateman attended prominent Phillips Exeter Academy for prep school. He graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Business School, and then moved to New York City.

By the end of the novel, he believes he is about to be arrested for murdering a colleague named Paul Allen (Paul Owen in the novel) and leaves a message on his lawyer&#x27;s answering machine confessing to his supposed crimes. When he runs into his lawyer at a party, however, the man mistakes him for somebody else and tells him that the message must have been a joke, as he had met with Allen only days earlier. Bateman realizes that the punishment and notoriety he desires will be forever out of his reach, and that he is trapped inside a meaningless existence: &quot;This is not an exit&quot;.

==Personality==

As written by Ellis, Bateman is the ultimate stereotype of yuppie greed; wealthy, conceited, and addicted to sex, drugs, and conspicuous consumption. All of his friends look alike to him, to the point that he often confuses one for another. They also often confuse him for other people. While Bateman delights in obsessively detailing virtually every single feature of his wealthy lifestyle, including his designer clothes, workout routine, business cards, alcoholic drinks, elaborate high-end stereo and home theater sound system, he cannot recognize his own friends, work colleagues, or acquaintances.

Bateman is engaged to an equally wealthy, shallow woman named Evelyn Williams and has a mistress on the side named Courtney Lawrence, the girlfriend of Luis Carruthers, a closeted homosexual whom Bateman despises. He has regular liaisons with prostitutes and women he encounters at clubs, many of whom end up being his victims. The one woman and possibly the only person in his life for whom he has anything approaching feelings is his secretary, Jean. He feels that she is the only person in his life who is not completely shallow, so he cannot bring himself to seduce or kill her. He casually acknowledges her as &quot;Jean, my secretary who is in love with me&quot; and introduces her in the narration as someone whom he &quot;will probably end up married to someday&quot;.

Despite his affluence and high social status, Bateman is constantly plagued by unsettling feelings of anxiety and low self-esteem. He kills many of his victims because they make him feel inadequate, usually by having better taste than he does. He is hated by others. His friends mock him as the &quot;boy next door&quot;, his own lawyer refers to him as a &quot;bloody ass-kisser... a brown-nosing goody-goody&quot;, and he is often dismissed as &quot;yuppie trash&quot; by people outside his social circle. Bateman often expresses doubts regarding his own sanity and he has periodic attacks of psychosis, during which he hallucinates. It is left open to reader interpretation whether Bateman actually commits the crimes he describes, or whether he is merely hallucinating them; he is, therefore, an unreliable narrator. The screenwriter Guinevere Turner confirmed that, at least in the film, Patrick Bateman isn&#x27;t imagining every act of violence: “Anything that seems unreal in the film &quot;to you personally&quot; might be unreal. But somewhere under everything you see, no matter how implausible it seems, real murders in some form are taking place.”

In the ending climax of the story, Bateman calls his lawyer and leaves a lengthy, detailed message confessing all of his crimes. He later runs into his lawyer, who mistakes him for someone else and dismisses the confession as a joke, while also claiming to have had dinner with one of Bateman&#x27;s victims after he had supposedly killed him, leaving the supposed reality of Bateman&#x27;s murders open to audience interpretation.

Although Bateman often claims that he is devoid of emotion, he also describes experiencing moments of extreme rage, panic or grief—being on the &quot;verge of tears&quot;—often over trivial inconveniences such as remembering to return videotapes or trying to obtain dinner reservations. In the middle of dismembering a victim, he breaks down, sobbing that he &quot;just wants to be loved&quot;. He takes psychotropics, including Xanax, to control these emotions. He publicly espouses a philosophy of tolerance, equality, and &quot;traditional moral values&quot; because he thinks it will make him more likable, but is actually virulently racist, homophobic, and antisemitic.

Bateman compensates for his anxiety through obsessive vanity and personal grooming, with unwavering attention to detail. He buys the most fashionable, expensive clothing and accessories possible, including Salvatore Ferragamo, Alan Flusser and Valentino suits, Oliver Peoples glasses and Jean Paul Gaultier, Louis Vuitton, and Bottega Veneta leather goods, as a means of effecting some &quot;control&quot; over his otherwise chaotic life. Likewise, while often being confused about people’s names and identities, he categorizes them by what they wear and how they look because they are more easily &quot;understood&quot; in terms of labels and stereotypes. Bateman&#x27;s apartment also is firmly controlled in terms of look and taste, with the latest music, food, and art.

Bateman kills and/or imagines having killed more or less indiscriminately, with no preferred type of victim, targeting any woman, man and animal who gets in his way (in one instance, a child), and no consistent or preferred method of killing. Women mostly for sadistic sexual pleasure, often during or just after sex. Men because they upset or annoy him or make him feel inferior. In the case of the child (a murder omitted in the film), Bateman wished to see if he would enjoy it but found it unsatisfactory since the child&#x27;s death would not affect as many people as an adult would. Periodically, he matter-of-factly confesses his crimes and/or fantasies to his friends, co-workers, and even complete strangers (&quot;I like to dissect girls, did you know I&#x27;m utterly insane?&quot;) just to see if they are actually listening to him. They either are not, think that he is joking, or completely misunderstand what he says.

==Outside &quot;American Psycho&quot;==
Bateman made his first appearance in Ellis&#x27;s 1987 novel &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; (in which Sean, his brother, is the protagonist); no indication is given that he is a serial killer. Bateman also makes a short appearance in Ellis&#x27;s 1998 novel &quot;Glamorama&quot;, with &quot;strange stains&quot; on the lapel of his Armani suit. Bateman also appeared in the &quot;American Psycho 2000&quot; e-mails, which were written as an advertisement campaign for the movie. Although they are often mistakenly credited to Ellis, they were actually written by one or more unnamed authors and approved by Ellis before being sent out. &quot;American Psycho 2000&quot; served as a sort of &quot;e-sequel&quot; to the original novel. The e-mails take place in 2000, a little over a decade since the novel. Bateman is in psychotherapy with &quot;Dr M&quot;. He is also married to Jean, his former secretary. They have a son, Patrick Bateman Jr. (P.B.), who is 8-years-old. In the story, Bateman talks about therapy, trying to get a divorce from Jean, his renewed feelings about murder, and idolizing his son. In the end, it is revealed that the &quot;real&quot; Bateman, who &quot;writes&quot; the e-mails, is the owner of the company that produces the movie.

Bateman appeared in Ellis&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;Lunar Park&quot;, in which the fictionalized Bret Easton Ellis confesses that writing &quot;American Psycho&quot; felt like channeling the words of a violent spirit rather than writing anything himself. This ghost—Bateman—haunts Ellis&#x27;s home. A character also comes to Ellis&#x27;s Halloween party dressed as Patrick Bateman, and a copycat killer is seemingly patterning himself on Bateman. Toward the novel&#x27;s end, Ellis writes the last Bateman story as a way of confronting and controlling the character, as well as the issues Ellis created Bateman as a means of countering. Bateman, for all intents and purposes, dies in a fire on a boat dock.

Though Christian Bale had been the first choice for the part by both Ellis and Harron, the role amused him after his agent told him that the role would be a &quot;professional suicide&quot;. The producers also offered the part to the likes of Keanu Reeves, Edward Norton, and Brad Pitt. Leonardo DiCaprio was set to play the character, but Ellis (as explained in the &quot;American Psycho&quot; DVD) decided he would appear too young, especially immediately after &quot;Titanic&quot;. In addition, his managers thought the role was &quot;too violent&quot; and could potentially hurt his career. Bateman was also portrayed by Dechen Thurman, a brother of Uma Thurman, in the 2000 documentary &quot;This Is Not an Exit: The Fictional World of Bret Easton Ellis&quot;. Michael Kremko played Bateman in the standalone sequel &quot;American Psycho 2&quot;, in which the character is killed by a would-be victim. Aside from the character appearing in the film, the sequel has no other connection to the previous film and has been denounced by Ellis.

Scenes with the character were shot for the 2002 film adaptation of &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;. Ellis revealed in an interview that director Roger Avary asked Bale to reprise the role, but Bale turned down the offer, and Avary asked Ellis himself to portray Bateman. Ellis refused, stating that he &quot;thought it was such a terrible and gimmicky idea&quot;, and Avary eventually shot the scenes with Casper Van Dien. The scenes, however, were ultimately cut from the final version of the film. In a 2009 interview with &quot;Black Book&quot;, director Mary Harron said, &quot;We talked about how Martian-like [the character] Patrick Bateman was, how he was looking at the world like somebody from another planet, watching what people did and trying to work out the right way to behave, and then one day [Christian] called me and he had been watching Tom Cruise on David Letterman, and he just had this very intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes, and he was really taken with this energy.&quot; &quot;Doctor Who&quot; star Matt Smith played the role in the 2013 stage musical version of the novel, with music and lyrics by Duncan Sheik and a book by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, at London&#x27;s Almeida Theatre. In 2016, Benjamin Walker portrayed Bateman in a Broadway production of the musical, which ran from March 21 – June 5, 2016.

In the television series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, Kevin Keller (portrayed by Casey Cott) performs in a musical production of &quot;American Psycho&quot; as Bateman in the sixth season episode &quot;Chapter One Hundred and Twelve: American Psychos&quot;. In the Showtime series &quot;Dexter&quot;, protagonist Dexter Morgan, himself a serial killer, uses the alias &quot;Dr. Patrick Bateman&quot; to acquire M-99 for the use of incapacitating his victims. There is a recurring character in the video game &quot;Criminal Case&quot; named Christian Bateman (a combination of the names Christian Bale and Patrick Bateman) modeled after the character. American rock duo Local H released their song &quot;Patrick Bateman&quot; as the lead single from their 2020 album &quot;Lifers&quot;. Metalcore band Ice Nine Kills released a single titled &quot;Hip to Be Scared&quot; based upon the film adaptation for their album &quot;The Silver Scream 2: Welcome to Horrorwood&quot;. Bateman was an influence to the titular character in &quot;Who&#x27;s Watching Oliver&quot; and was compared to the main character in &quot;Continuance&quot;. In February 2024, it was announced a remake of the 2000 film was in development. A screenwriter was being sought after, and the film will take place in modern times. In October 2024, the film was revealed to be a new adaptation of Ellis&#x27; novel to be directed by Luca Guadagnino from a script by Scott Z. Burns, with Austin Butler cast as Bateman in December.

<text>Margaret Elizabeth Wright (20 February 1940 – 22 June 2012) was a Green Party politician and from 2008 to 2012 a city councillor for Abbey Ward on Cambridge City Council in England. She was one of the Principal Speakers of the Green Party, a post she held with Darren Johnson, from 1999 to 2003.

She was several times elected by the Eastern Region of the Green Party to the first place on their list for the European Parliament.

Wright was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, then studied history at Bedford College, London, and teaching at the University of Oxford. Later in life, she also obtained a master&#x27;s degree in art history from Birkbeck College. She moved to Cambridge with her three children and joined the Ecology Party in 1979, this later becoming the Green Party.

Margaret Wright contested the Cambridge constituency for the Green Party in both 1987 (the first time the Greens contested the seat) and 1997, gaining 1.1% and 1.3% respectively. She was Press Officer for Cambridge Green Party, and also served on the national executive of the Green Party, relating to international issues, and, fluent in French and German, the International Committee.

<doc id="468903" wikidata="Q24041325" url="?curid=468903" title="Songs of a Wayfarer">
<text>Songs of a Wayfarer is a song cycle for baritone and piano composed by John Ireland (18791962) between 1903 and 1911, and published in 1912. It consists of settings of five poems by various poets.

A performance takes about 12 minutes. The songs are:

# &quot;Memory&quot; (William Blake (17571827); &quot;Memory, hither come&quot;, from &quot;Poetical Sketches&quot; (1783))
# &quot;When Daffodils Begin to Peer&quot; (William Shakespeare (15641616); from &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Act IV, Scene 3)
# &quot;English May&quot; (Dante Gabriel Rossetti (182882); from &quot;The Collected Works of Dante Gabriel Rossetti&quot;, Vol. I (1886))
# &quot;I Was Not Sorrowful&quot; (Ernest Dowson (18671900); &quot;Spleen&quot;, from &quot;Verses&quot; (1896))
# &quot;I Will Walk on the Earth&quot; (James Vila Blake (18421925))

In 1919, Edwin Evans described the cycle as being &quot;of unequal merit but containing at least one song worthy to rank with its successors&quot;. In 2007, Richard Nicholson in a review of the recording by Benjamin Luxon (baritone) and Alan Rowlands (piano) (1972 or 1973) remarked that the songs &quot;clearly have a foot in the nineteenth-century, with the influence of Brahms and Stanford acutely felt, but they show any amount of artistic promise&quot;.

<text>Glen Iris is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Boroondara and Stonnington local government areas. Glen Iris recorded a population of 26,131 at the 2021 census.

Glen Iris had been Melbourne&#x27;s geographical centre of population from the 1990s to the 2020s, with urban sprawl seeing Melbourne&#x27;s centre of population shifting to Camberwell in the 2020s.

==History==

Captain Thomas Henderson, of the Royal Navy, arrived in Melbourne on a ship called &quot;Iris&quot; in 1850. He acquired a property bounded by Gardiners Creek, High Street and a line extending Summerhill Road to Gardiners Creek. The property was advertised for sale as &quot;Glen Iris&quot;, in 1852. Robert Kent, a subsequent owner of the &quot;Glen Iris&quot; homestead, suggested a Mechanics&#x27; Institute be established, but it was never completed. A Wesleyan church was established in 1865 and in 1871 land was granted for an adjacent school (now Glen Iris Primary School). By the 1880s reference was made to the Township of Glen Iris. Glen Iris Post Office opened on 28 August 1890. A Glen Iris Upper Post Office was open from 1947 until 1994.

==Places of interest==

A number of government and independent schools are located in Glen Iris, including Camberwell South Primary School, Glen Iris Primary School, St Cecilia&#x27;s Primary School, St Roch&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Sacré Cœur School, Korowa Anglican Girls&#x27; School and Caulfield Grammar School Malvern campus (the latter three are all situated within a few blocks of one another, south of High Street and east of Burke Road).

Recreational and sporting facilities include the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre, a BMX track at Hill&#x27;n&#x27;Dale Park, Burwood District Bowls Club and a number of reserves and ovals, including Hartwell Sports Ground, Ferndale Park and T.H. King Oval. The Glen Iris wetlands were established by the former City of Malvern in 1989. The Harold Holt Swim Centre was built in memory of former Prime Minister Harold Holt, whose electoral seat of Higgins included Glen Iris. This pool has led to the amusement of many locals and visitors as they realise a pool was built to commemorate a man who was presumed drowned after going missing, at Cheviot Beach, Portsea in 1967.

Glen Iris Road Uniting Church incorporates part of the original 1865 Wesleyan Church building.

The division between the Boroondara and Stonnington municipalities follows the course of Gardiners Creek, which is a tributary of the Yarra River. A tributary of Gardiners Creek, running north through the suburb, Back Creek, has largely been turned into a drain. Also roughly following the course of Gardiners Creek is the Monash Freeway, and the Glen Waverley train line.

==Transport==

Two train stations on the Glen Waverley railway line, Gardiner and Glen Iris, are within the suburb. Passing through the eastern part of Glen Iris is the Alamein line, with Burwood Station also within the boundaries of the suburb (Glen Iris did not originally cover this far east, and this station and its surrounds were originally in the suburb of Burwood). Residents are also served by the numbers 5, 6, 72 and 75 tram routes. Melbourne bus routes also service the area.

<text>Aquiles Serdán Alatriste (2 November 1876 – 18 November 1910) was a Mexican politician. He was born in the city of Puebla, Puebla, and was a supporter of the Mexican Revolution led by Francisco I. Madero.

His family was politically active and involved. His grandfather, Miguel C. Alatriste, was a strong liberal during the Reform, and served as governor of the state of Puebla in 1857. During the French Intervention, Alatriste fought against the invaders and their Mexican conservative allies, was captured and executed. His father, Manuel Serdán, was one of the founders of the &quot;Partido Socialista Mexicano&quot; (Mexican Socialist Party), and co-authored &quot;La Ley del Pueblo&quot; that called for agrarian reform. Manuel Serdán disappeared, perhaps murdered by authorities.

Aquiles Serdán was a shoemaker by trade, as was his father, Manuel Serdán. He read Francisco I. Madero&#x27;s 1909 book, &quot;The Presidential Succession of 1910&quot;, in which Madero laid out the problems of Mexico under Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s rule and called for open elections. Serdán corresponded with Madero and organized an Anti-Reelectionist Club in the city of Puebla, joined mainly by textile workers. He became a revolutionary, opposing Díaz. Serdán was arrested by Díaz&#x27;s government, spending October - December 1909 in prison.

He actively campaigned for Madero in the 1910 presidential elections, but when Madero was arrested and fraudulent elections held, Serdán left for the United States. After the Electoral College declared Díaz and Ramón Corral victors in the 1910 elections, Serdán is reported to have said, &quot;Do not intone the hosanna of Victory, Señores Porfiristas and Corralistas, for we Anti-Reelectionists have not yet fired the last cartridge.&quot;

When Madero escaped jail in 1910 and issued the Plan of San Luis Potosí, which called for rebellion throughout Mexico on November 20, 1910, Serdán returned to Puebla to organize revolution there. He and his brother Máximo bought arms and raised support from men to bear them. His sister Carmen Serdán went to San Antonio, Texas, a center of exiled Mexican revolutionaries, and obtained 20,000 pesos for the rebellion.

The Díaz government got wind of the Serdán&#x27;s revolutionary activities and the Puebla police chief and men under his command came to the Serdán family home, where violence ensued on 18 November 1910. Serdán, his brother Máximo, and his wife, mother, and sister Carmen, along with nine men, defended the house. Although he had hopes that the city of Puebla would rise, it did not and the government forces killed Serdán, losing 158 of its own men. When Madero heard of Serdán&#x27;s death, he is reported to have said, &quot;It does not matter. They have shown us how to die.&quot;

The northern municipality of Aquiles Serdán, Chihuahua, was renamed in his honor in 1932; he is also remembered by Metro Aquiles Serdán, a station on the Mexico City Metro. His house on Santa Clara Street in the center of Puebla is a museum and remains as he left it the day he was killed.

<text>Georg Gottfried Gervinus (20 May 1805 – 18 March 1871) was a German literary and political historian.

==Biography==
Gervinus was born in Darmstadt. He was educated at the gymnasium of the town, and intended for a commercial career, but in 1825 he became a student of the university of Giessen. In 1826 he went to Heidelberg, where he attended the lectures of the historian Schlosser, who became henceforth his guide and his model. In 1828 he was appointed teacher at a private school at Frankfort-on-Main, and in 1830 &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at Heidelberg. In this period he became a friend of the young historian Karl von Hegel (the son of the Philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel) and of the jurist Georg Beseler.

A volume of his collected &quot;Historische Schriften&quot; procured him the appointment of professor extraordinarius; while the first volume of his &quot;Geschichte der poetischen Nationallitteratur der Deutschen&quot; (History of the poetical national literature of the Germans; 1835–1842, 5 vols.) subsequently entitled &quot;Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung&quot; (History of German poetry; 5th edition, by Karl Bartsch, 1871–1874) brought him the appointment to a regular professorship of history and literature at Göttingen. This work is the first comprehensive history of German literature written both with scholarly erudition and literary skill. In the following year he wrote his &quot;Grundzüge der Historik&quot;, which is perhaps the most thoughtful of his philosophico-historical productions.

The same year brought his expulsion from Göttingen in consequence of his protest, in conjunction with six of his colleagues, against the violation of the constitution by Ernest Augustus, king of Hanover and duke of Cumberland. After several years in Heidelberg, Darmstadt and Rome, he settled permanently in Heidelberg, where, in 1844, he was appointed honorary professor. He zealously took up in the following year the cause of the German Catholics, hoping it would lead to a union of all the Christian confessions, and to the establishment of a national church. He also came forward in 1846 as a patriotic champion of the Schleswig-Holsteiners, and when, in 1847, King Frederick William IV promulgated the royal decree for summoning the so-called United Diet (), Gervinus hoped that this event would form the basis of the constitutional development of the largest German state. He founded, together with some other patriotic scholars, the &quot;Deutsche Zeitung&quot;, which certainly was one of the best-written political journals ever published in Germany. His appearance in the political arena secured his election as deputy for the Prussian province of Saxony to the National Assembly sitting in 1848 at Frankfort. Disgusted with the failure of that body, he retired from all active political life.

In 1839/40, Gervinus approached Therese Forster, the daughter of German explorer, writer and revolutionary Georg Forster, and suggested an edition of her father&#x27;s complete works to be published by Brockhaus in Leipzig, with a biographic introduction by Gervinus. The nine-volume edition appeared in 1843 and remained the prevailing edition of Georg Forster&#x27;s works for more than a century. 

Gervinus now devoted himself to literary and historical studies, and between 1849 and 1852 published his work on Shakespeare (4 vols., 4th ed. 2 vols., 1872; Eng. trans. by F. E. Bunnett, 1863, new ed. 1877). He also revised his &quot;History of German Literature&quot;, for a fourth edition (1853), and began at the same time to plan his &quot;Geschichte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts&quot; (8 vols., 1854–1860), which was preceded by an &quot;Einleitung in die Geschichte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts&quot; (1853).

The latter work caused some stir in the literary and political world, owing to the circumstance that the government of Baden imprudently instituted a prosecution against the author for high treason. Arraigned before a tribunal, Gervinus defended himself with a great display of ability and courage, but was nevertheless condemned to an imprisonment of two months, and all the copies of the &quot;seditious publication&quot; were to be destroyed. However, the verdict was rescinded by a higher tribunal. Afterward, Gervinus buried himself still more among his books, and even forebore to deliver lectures.

In 1856, the Händel-Gesellschaft society was founded by Gervinus and the German music historian and critic Friedrich Chrysander. The aim of the society was to publish the collected works of Georg Frideric Handel.

In 1868 appeared &quot;Händel und Shakespeare, zur Asthetik der Tonkunst&quot;, in which he drew an ingenious parallel between his favorite poet and his favorite composer, showing that their intellectual affinity was based on the Teutonic origin common to both, on their analogous intellectual development and character. The ill-success of this publication, and the indifference with which the latter volumes of his &quot;History of the 19th Century&quot; were received by his countrymen, together with the feeling of disappointment that the unity of Germany had been brought about in another fashion and by other means than he wished to see employed, embittered his later years, though it did not sour his kindly and humane disposition, nor did it in the least affect his sociable temper, and he cultivated refined society to the last. He died in Heidelberg on 18 March 1871.

Gervinus was a close friend of Georg Friedrich Fallenstein, the father of Helene Fallenstein, who would become the mother of the famous scholar, Max Weber. In her biography of Weber, Marianne Weber, his wife, writes that Helene was sexually molested and probably raped by Gervinus, who was living upstairs in the Fallenstein household after Fallenstein&#x27;s death. The biography describes Gervinus as a &quot;fatherly friend&quot; of Fallenstein&#x27;s daughters who regularly read Homer to the girls in their youth. &quot;When she [Helene] was 16,&quot; Marianne Weber writes, &quot;a chaste, closed bud of a girl, Gervinus, whom she respected as a teacher, loved like a father, and had trusted for years, one day lost control of himself. The aging man suddenly engulfed the unsuspecting girl with the searing heat of a passion beyond control. She was torn by horror, disgust, pity, and her old grateful devotion to her fatherly friend and teacher. Because her nerves were delicate, she came close to a breakdown. Helene never got over this shock. From that moment on she regarded physical passion as guilt-laden and sub-human. Even when she was an old woman, the memory of that experience would bring an expression of horror to her face.&quot; Soon thereafter, the biography continues, Helene met Max Weber Sr. Engagement soon followed, and Helene subsequently described their marriage (which over time would become an unhappy one) as having saved her from the trauma of the Gervinus assault.

==Works==
&quot;Geschichte der Deutschen Dichtung&quot; was the first comprehensive history of German poetry in a connected form. The author represented the literary activity of Germany in its successive stages as it grew out of her political life, thus making political history the foil and basis of literary history. His judgment was sincere and independent, although his criticism often assumed a censorious and pedantic tone against the most prominent poets of Germany, for example Goethe, Schiller and Jean Paul. Notwithstanding this criticism, the German people, without allowing themselves to be misguided in their judgment regarding the merits of these poets, gratefully accepted his work as a national homage to the subject.

The object of Gervinus in writing this literary history was also a patriotic one. He endeavoured to show that Germany, having already attained great eminence in literature, should henceforth exclusively devote herself to political activity, and surpass other nations also in this respect.

He had a no less patriotic object in view in writing his commentary on Shakespeare, which was made popular in England by a translation. This work is not so much a philological or aesthetical commentary as a treatise pointing out the ethical or moral precepts which may be deduced from Shakespeare&#x27;s productions, and this circumstance makes it of considerable value and interest also to English readers. Gervinus, who considered Shakespeare the intellectual property of Germany, in the same way as he considered Handel the artistic property of England, wished above all to inculcate on his countrymen the teachings of healthy practical activity to be found in the works of the English dramatist. The object for which he wrote, that is the moral improvement of his readers from a practical point of view, seemed to him the easier to be accomplished through the productions of Shakespeare, because the poet was descended from a kindred race, and the fructifying seeds of his thoughts and sentiments, falling upon a congenial soil, would be sure to take root there kindly.

As a political historian, Gervinus was the antipode of Ranke. Following the principles of F. C. Schlosser, he slighted all documentary history. He had such a deep distrust of all state papers and diplomatic documents that he considered them as most untrustworthy sources for any historical record. He confined himself, therefore, chiefly to taking into account the political events and their results just as they lay on the surface; and, not consulting the state archives for the secret springs which set them in motion, he based his historical narratives almost entirely on his subjective judgment. Many brilliant passages will be found in his general &quot;History of the 19th Century&quot;, such as the accounts of the South American and Greek revolutions, and of the July revolution in 1830; and his &quot;Historische Schriften&quot; also contain a number of valuable treatises and essays, which may be said to have paved the way to a new era in the art of writing history.

Gervinus entertained a kindly feeling towards England, which he called the land of political mastery; and though he was rather a cosmopolitan, he nevertheless remained a German patriot to the core. Ranke&#x27;s opinion was &quot;that he will never be forgotten.&quot;

==Bibliography==
Gervinus&#x27;s autobiography (&quot;G. G. Gervinus Leben, von ihm selbst&quot;) was published by his widow in 1893. It does not, however, go beyond the year 1836. See E. Lehmann, &quot;Gervinus, Versuch einer Charakteristik&quot; (1871); R. Gosche, &quot;Gervinus&quot; (1871); J. Dörfel, &quot;Gervinus als historischer Denker&quot; (1904).

<doc id="468911" wikidata="Q7245066" url="?curid=468911" title="Leader of the Green Party of England and Wales">
<text>The Leader of the Green Party of England and Wales is the most senior political figure within the Green Party of England and Wales. The role was introduced alongside that of deputy leader in 2008. Prior to this, the party&#x27;s public spokespersons were principal speakers. There were two principal speakers, one female and one male, who were elected annually at the Green Party&#x27;s Autumn Conference and held no vote on the Green Party Executive (GPEx).

A referendum passed on 30 November 2007 that abolished the posts of principal speakers and a leader and deputy were elected at the party&#x27;s next autumn conference on 5 September 2008.

==Role and history==
The principal speakers performed the public and media roles undertaken by the leaders of more conventional political parties. Green parties often consider joint leadership of this kind to embody the widely held Green beliefs in consensus decision making and gender balance. It also symbolises their belief in the need for a society in which people are empowered and involved in making the decisions which affect them. In the party&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Basis&quot;, it states that the Green Party &quot;reject[s] the hierarchical structure of leaders and followers, and, instead advocate[s] participatory politics&quot; and it is &quot;for this reason&quot; that the Green Party has eschewed an individual leader.

There were six principal speakers in the UK Green Party until 1991, when changes introduced by the Green 2000 grouping reduced this to two and streamlined the organisation of the party. This left a system with which neither side in the 2007 leadership referendum was happy.

===2007 Leadership referendum===
At the party&#x27;s 2007 spring conference in Swansea, members voted to hold a cross-party referendum on whether the posts should be changed to leader and deputy leader (with the option for co-leaders if two candidates chose to run together and were gender balanced, in the event of which there would be no deputy leader). The new system would allow the leader and deputy (or co-leaders) to vote on GPEx and, rather than being elected annually (like the principal speakers), the posts would be elected every two years. Provisions for recalling the leader and deputy were articulated. Despite the controversial nature of this issue, many participants, such as Siân Berry, were struck by the how &quot;constructive&quot; the debate turned out to be.

On Friday 30 November 2007 the ballots were counted and members voted 73% to 27% in favour of the new leadership model, with a 48.3% turnout of Green Party members.

====The &#x27;Pro-Leader&#x27; side – Green Yes====
Supporters of the &#x27;Green Yes&#x27; campaign for a yes vote in the referendum included the then-principal speaker Caroline Lucas MEP, Siân Berry, Darren Johnson AM (a Green member of the London Assembly), environmental commentator and Green member Mark Lynas, former principal speaker Jonathon Porritt, councillors from Lewisham, Brighton, Norwich, Leicester and Lancaster, and members of the Green Party Executive (GPEx), including Jim Killock (external communications officer), elections coordinator Peter Cranie and Khalid Hussenbux, the party&#x27;s financial coordinator.

The Green Yes campaign believed that the Green Party needed a leader to reach its potential and that, if the party did not reach its potential, it would be &quot;selling-short our planet and everything on it&quot;. They suggested that the party&#x27;s success has been too slow and that &quot;a leader would help set direction, political focus and make sure the party gets the resources to grow&quot;. The campaign hoped that having a Leader would be &quot;about empowering the party&quot; and &quot;about accountability&quot;, in that a Leader would &quot;mean we can identify who to hold to account when things need changing&quot;. The group added that other Green Parties in the world had leaders and remained &quot;just as Green as the rest of us&quot;.

Mark Lynas, in several editions of his &quot;New Statesman&quot; blog, further claimed that the name &#x27;Principal Speaker&#x27; was not transparent to the public, that it wasted valuable time in explaining the system to the media and that it lacked credibility. Darren Johnson characterized the lack of single leader as &quot;just a ridiculous barrier in terms of getting our really important message across&quot;.

====The &#x27;Anti-Leader&#x27; side – Green Empowerment====
Supporters of the &#x27;Green Empowerment&#x27; campaign for a no vote in the leadership referendum included the then-Principal Speaker Derek Wall, Jenny Jones AM (a Green member of the London Assembly), the late Timothy Beaumont (Green member of the House of Lords), prominent human rights campaigner and Green member Peter Tatchell, Noel Lynch (London Green Party Coordinator and former London Assembly member), councillors from Scarborough, Lewisham, York, Norwich and Hackney, and members of the Green Party Executive (GPEx), including Campaigns Coordinator, Tim Summers, and Pete McAskie (Management Coordinator). Some members, like Matt Sellwood, while in favour of a Leader system in principle, were opposed to the current referendum because the term of reelection would be extended to two years.

Supporters of Green Empowerment wanted to &quot;uphold the Green Party&#x27;s long-standing commitment to non-hierarchical structures and &#x27;grassroots&#x27; democracy&quot; through &quot;collective leadership&quot;. They believed that a single leader &quot;would not only draw attention away from other speakers and the wider Party, but would bring with it risks that the other parties in this country are all too well aware of&quot;. The campaign focused on retaining gender balance in party structures, and avoiding the dilution of their radical policies. They focused on success under the Principal Speaker system, seen in the steady buildup of support from the low point of the 1992 general election to the situation at the time of the referendum, where the party has over 100 councilors along with two members of the European Parliament and two members of the London Assembly.

Derek Wall countered pro-leader arguments by stating that &quot;if you are a clear speaker, there&#x27;s no problem getting coverage and explaining the party&#x27;s views.&quot; He was concerned by the history of past political parties that started off as being participatory until they adopted a single leader system in which the members became &quot;puppets&quot;. Wall also opposed the reduction in numbers of Principal Speakers from six to two in 1992, as advocated by the Green 2000 group.

===Party Leader era===
In September 2008 Caroline Lucas was elected as the party&#x27;s first leader. Lucas was reelected in 2010 but chose not to stand in 2012, when Natalie Bennett was elected her successor. After Bennett stood down in 2016 Lucas returned as leader, this time sharing the position with Jonathan Bartley.

In 2018, Siân Berry replaced Lucas as co-leader, with Bartley continuing in the role.

In July 2021 Jonathan Bartley announced he would be standing down as the party&#x27;s co-leader at the end of the month, triggering the 2021 Green Party of England and Wales leadership election. Siân Berry remained as acting leader, but decided not to stand in the leadership election due to her concerns over the party&#x27;s message on trans rights. In her statement, Berry cited unspecified spokesperson appointments as being inconsistent with her pledge to support trans equality.

<doc id="468915" wikidata="Q838101" url="?curid=468915" title="While loop">
<text>In most computer programming languages, a while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The &quot;while&quot; loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

==Overview==
The &quot;while&quot; construct consists of a block of code and a condition/expression. The condition/expression is evaluated, and if the condition/expression is &quot;true&quot;, the code within all of their following in the block is executed. This repeats until the condition/expression becomes false. Because the &quot;while&quot; loop checks the condition/expression before the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a pre-test loop. Compare this with the &quot;do while&quot; loop, which tests the condition/expression &quot;after&quot; the loop has executed.

For example, in the languages C, Java, C#, Objective-C, and C++, (which use the same syntax in this case), the code fragment
int x = 0;

while (x &lt; 5) {
 printf (&quot;x = %d\n&quot;, x);
 x++;


first checks whether x is less than 5, which it is, so then the {loop body} is entered, where the &quot;printf&quot; function is run and x is incremented by 1. After completing all the statements in the loop body, the condition, (x &lt; 5), is checked again, and the loop is executed again, this process repeating until the variable x has the value 5.

It is possible, and in some cases desirable, for the condition to &quot;always&quot; evaluate to true, creating an infinite loop. When such a loop is created intentionally, there is usually another control structure (such as a break statement) that controls termination of the loop.
For example:
while (true) {
 // do complicated stuff
 if (someCondition)
 break;
 // more stuff


==Demonstrating &quot;while&quot; loops==
These &quot;while&quot; loops will calculate the factorial of the number 5:

===ActionScript 3===
var counter: int = 5;
var factorial: int = 1;

while (counter &gt; 1) {
 factorial *= counter;
 counter--;

Printf(&quot;Factorial = %d&quot;, factorial);
===Ada===

with Ada.Integer_Text_IO;

procedure Factorial is
 Counter : Integer := 5;
 Factorial : Integer := 1;
begin
 while Counter &gt; 0 loop
 Factorial := Factorial * Counter;
 Counter := Counter - 1;
 end loop;

 Ada.Integer_Text_IO.Put (Factorial);
end Factorial;
===APL===
counter ← 5
factorial ← 1

:While counter &gt; 0
 factorial ×← counter
 counter -← 1
:EndWhile

⎕ ← factorial
or simply

!5
===AutoHotkey===
counter := 5
factorial := 1

While counter &gt; 0
 factorial *= counter--

MsgBox % factorial
===Small Basic===
counter = 5 &#x27; Counter = 5
factorial = 1 &#x27; initial value of variable &quot;factorial&quot;

While counter &gt; 0
 factorial = factorial * counter
 counter = counter - 1
 TextWindow.WriteLine(counter)
EndWhile

===Visual Basic===
Dim counter As Integer = 5 &#x27; init variable and set value
Dim factorial As Integer = 1 &#x27; initialize factorial variable

Do While counter &gt; 0
 factorial = factorial * counter
 counter = counter - 1
Loop &#x27; program goes here, until counter = 0

&#x27;Debug.Print factorial &#x27; Console.WriteLine(factorial) in Visual Basic .NET
===Bourne (Unix) shell===
counter=5
factorial=1
while [ $counter -gt 0 ]; do
 factorial=$((factorial * counter))
 counter=$((counter - 1))
done

echo $factorial
===C, C++===
int main() {
 int count = 5;
 int factorial = 1;

 while (count &gt; 1)
 factorial *= count--;

 printf(&quot;%d&quot;, factorial);


===ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML)===
====Script syntax====

counter = 5;
factorial = 1;

while (counter &gt; 1) {
 factorial *= counter--;

writeOutput(factorial);
====Tag syntax====
&lt;cfset counter = 5&gt;
&lt;cfset factorial = 1&gt;
&lt;cfloop condition=&quot;counter GT 1&quot;&gt;
 &lt;cfset factorial *= counter--&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#factorial#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
===Fortran===
program FactorialProg
 integer :: counter = 5
 integer :: factorial = 1

 do while (counter &gt; 0)
 factorial = factorial * counter
 counter = counter - 1
 end do

 print *, factorial
end program FactorialProg
===Go===

Go has no &quot;while&quot; statement, but it has the function of a &quot;for&quot; statement when omitting some elements of the &quot;for&quot; statement.
counter, factorial := 5, 1

for counter &gt; 1 {
 counter, factorial = counter-1, factorial*counter


===Java, C#, D===

The code for the loop is the same for Java, C# and D:
int counter = 5;
int factorial = 1;

while (counter &gt; 1)
 factorial *= counter--;
===JavaScript===
let counter = 5;
let factorial = 1;

while (counter &gt; 1)
 factorial *= counter--;

console.log(factorial);
===Lua===
counter = 5
factorial = 1

while counter &gt; 0 do
 factorial = factorial * counter
 counter = counter - 1
end

print(factorial)
===MATLAB, Octave===
counter = 5;
factorial = 1;

while (counter &gt; 0)
 factorial = factorial * counter; %Multiply
 counter = counter - 1; %Decrement
end

factorial
===Mathematica===
Block[{counter=5,factorial=1}, (*localize counter and factorial*)
 While[counter&gt;0, (*While loop*)
 factorial*=counter; (*Multiply*)
 counter--; (*Decrement*)

 factorial


===Oberon, Oberon-2, Oberon-07, Component Pascal===
MODULE Factorial;
IMPORT Out;
VAR
 Counter, Factorial: INTEGER;
BEGIN
 Counter := 5;
 Factorial := 1;

 WHILE Counter &gt; 0 DO
 Factorial := Factorial * Counter;
 DEC(Counter)
 END;

 Out.Int(Factorial,0)
END Factorial.
===Maya Embedded Language===
int $counter = 5;
int $factorial = 1;

int $multiplication;

while ($counter &gt; 0) {
 $multiplication = $factorial * $counter;

 $counter -= 1;

 print(&quot;Counter is: &quot; + $counter + &quot;, multiplication is: &quot; + $multiplication + &quot;\n&quot;);


===Nim===
var
 counter = 5 # Set counter value to 5
 factorial = 1 # Set factorial value to 1

while counter &gt; 0: # While counter is greater than 0
 factorial *= counter # Set new value of factorial to counter.
 dec counter # Set the counter to counter - 1.

echo factorial
Non-terminating while loop:
while true:
 echo &quot;Help! I&#x27;m stuck in a loop!&quot;
===Pascal===

Pascal has two forms of the while loop, while and repeat. While repeats one statement (unless enclosed in a begin-end block) as long as the condition is true. The repeat statement repetitively executes a block of one or more statements through an until statement and continues repeating unless the condition is false. The main difference between the two is the while loop may execute zero times if the condition is initially false, the repeat-until loop always executes at least once.

while ($counter &gt; 0) {
 $factorial *= $counter--; # Multiply, then decrement

print $factorial;
&quot;While&quot; loops are frequently used for reading data line by line (as defined by the codice_1 line separator) from open filehandles:
open IN, &quot;&lt;test.txt&quot;;

while (&lt;IN&gt;) {
 print;

close IN;
===PHP===
$counter = 5;
$factorial = 1;

while ($counter &gt; 0) {
 $factorial *= $counter--; // Multiply, then decrement.

echo $factorial;
===PL/I===
declare counter fixed initial(5);
declare factorial fixed initial(1);

do while(counter &gt; 0)
 factorial = factorial * counter;
 counter = counter - 1;
end;
===Python===
counter = 5 # Set the value to 5
factorial = 1 # Set the value to 1

while counter &gt; 0: # While counter(5) is greater than 0
 factorial *= counter # Set new value of factorial to counter.
 counter -= 1 # Set the counter to counter - 1.

print(factorial) # Print the value of factorial.
Non-terminating while loop:
while True:
 print(&quot;Help! I&#x27;m stuck in a loop!&quot;)
===Racket===

In Racket, as in other Scheme implementations, a &quot;named-let&quot; is a popular way to implement loops:

#lang racket
(define counter 5)
(define factorial 1)
(let loop ()
 (when (&gt; counter 0)
 (set! factorial (* factorial counter))
 (set! counter (sub1 counter))
 (loop)))
(displayln factorial)

Using a macro system, implementing a &quot;while&quot; loop is a trivial exercise (commonly used to introduce macros):

#lang racket
(define-syntax-rule (while test body ...) ; implements a while loop
 (let loop () (when test body ... (loop))))
(define counter 5)
(define factorial 1)
(while (&gt; counter 0)
 (set! factorial (* factorial counter))
 (set! counter (sub1 counter)))
(displayln factorial)

However, an imperative programming style is often discouraged in Scheme and Racket.

===Ruby===
# Calculate the factorial of 5
i = 1
factorial = 1

while i &lt;= 5
 factorial *= i
 i += 1
end

puts factorial
===Rust===
fn main() {
 let mut counter = 5;
 let mut factorial = 1;

 while counter &gt; 1 {
 factorial *= counter;
 counter -= 1;

 println!(&quot;{}&quot;, factorial);


===Smalltalk===

Contrary to other languages, in Smalltalk a &quot;while&quot; loop is not a language construct but defined in the class codice_2 as a method with one parameter, the body as a closure, using self as the condition.

Smalltalk also has a corresponding whileFalse: method.
| count factorial |
count := 5.
factorial := 1.
[count &gt; 0] whileTrue:
 [factorial := factorial * count.
 count := count - 1].

===Swift===
var counter = 5 // Set the initial counter value to 5
var factorial = 1 // Set the initial factorial value to 1

while counter &gt; 0 { // While counter(5) is greater than 0
 factorial *= counter // Set new value of factorial to factorial x counter.
 counter -= 1 // Set the new value of counter to counter - 1.

print(factorial) // Print the value of factorial.
===Tcl===
set counter 5
set factorial 1

while {$counter &gt; 0} {
 set factorial [expr $factorial * $counter]
 incr counter -1

puts $factorial
===VEX===
int counter = 5;
int factorial = 1;

while (counter &gt; 1)
 factorial *= counter--;

printf(&quot;%d&quot;, factorial);
===PowerShell===
$counter = 5
$factorial = 1

while ($counter) {
 $factorial *= $counter--

$factorial
===While (language)===
While is a simple programming language constructed from assignments, sequential composition, conditionals, and while statements, used in the theoretical analysis of imperative programming language semantics.

C := 5;
F := 1;

while (C &gt; 1) do
 F := F * C;
 C := C - 1;

<text>Frank Romer Pierson (May 12, 1925 – July 22, 2012) was an American screenwriter and film director.

==Life and career==
Pierson was born in Chappaqua, New York, the son of Louise (née Randall), a writer, and Harold C. Pierson. Pierson&#x27;s family was the subject of his mother&#x27;s 1943 autobiography &quot;Roughly Speaking&quot; and a 1945 movie of the same name, starring Rosalind Russell and Jack Carson as his parents.

Pierson served in the Army during World War II, then graduated from Harvard. He worked as a correspondent for &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines before selling his first script to Alcoa-Goodyear Theater. He got his break in Hollywood in 1958 as script editor for &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; and moved on to write for the television series &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot; and others. He wrote or co-wrote several successful films, including &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; and &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;, which were both nominated for Academy Awards. He wrote &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;, which won Pierson the Academy Award. He directed and contributed to the screenplay of the 1976 remake of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;; and the in-fighting between himself, Barbra Streisand, Kris Kristofferson and producer (and at the time boyfriend of Streisand) Jon Peters on the film led him to write the article &quot;My Battles with Barbra and Jon&quot; for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

Pierson directed several films produced for television, including &quot;Dirty Pictures&quot;, &quot;Citizen Cohn&quot;, &quot;Conspiracy&quot;, and &quot;Somebody Has to Shoot the Picture&quot;. His direction on &quot;Conspiracy&quot; won a Directors&#x27; Guild Award for Best Television Movie, and his second Peabody and BAFTA Award.

He was President of the Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) from 1981 to 1983 and again from 1993 to 1995 and was President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) from 2001 to 2005. In 2003, Pierson was the recipient of the Austin Film Festival&#x27;s Distinguished Screenwriter Award. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland presented him with the Award. He was a consultant on &quot;Mad Men&quot;, co-writing (with Matthew Weiner) the fifth episode of its fifth season, &quot;Signal 30&quot;, a member of the teaching staff of Sundance Institute, and artistic director of the American Film Institute.

Pierson died on July 22, 2012, in his home in Los Angeles, California. He was survived by his wife Helene and his two children.

<text>James Burbage ( 1531 – 2 February 1597) was an English actor, theatre impresario, joiner, and theatre builder in the English Renaissance theatre. He built The Theatre, the first permanent dedicated theatre built in England since Roman times.

==Life==

James Burbage was born around 1531, probably in Bromley in Kent. He was apprenticed in London to the trade of joiner, and must have persevered through his apprenticeship and taken up his freedom, as in 1559 he was referred to as a joiner twice in the register of St Stephen&#x27;s, Coleman Street. He was also one of the greatest at the craft of carpentry, which gave him an advantage at his start of theatrical management later in his life.

===Career===

Burbage took up acting and was the leader of Leicester&#x27;s Men by 1572. Burbage had various talents, e.g. an actor, builder, and theatre owner; he was heavily involved in groups concerning theatre. He was said to be a theatre professional &quot;who bridged the gap between late-medieval drama in London and the flowering of the great Elizabethan Theatre.&quot; Burbage was described as handsome in appearance, charming in manner, honest, tactful, and witty by Sir Robert Dudley, patron of Leicester&#x27;s Men. Another professional acquaintance depicted James as more motivated by commerce than by art because of his dependency on financial success. He also was the father to one of Shakespeare’s personal friends, Richard Burbage, who played all the great roles in Shakespeare plays. It is possible that the young Shakespeare would have encountered James who had visited Stratford-upon-Avon with a troupe of actors on at least two occasions in the 1570s. It was his personal experience of a traveling actor&#x27;s life that prompted him to establish the Theatre in Shoreditch in 1576 which he built with a loan from his brother-in-law John Brayne.

===Family===

Burbage married Ellen Brayne, the daughter of Thomas Brayne, a London tailor and sister of his later business partner John Brayne, on 23 April 1559. They were settled in St. Leonard&#x27;s parish in Shoreditch by 1576, with residence in Halliwell Street or Holywell Lane.

Cuthbert Burbage, the elder son, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a theatre manager, while the younger son, Richard became one of the most celebrated actors of his era. He showed his talents alongside Shakespeare, both being co-owners of the Globe Theatre.

===Death===
James Burbage was buried in Shoreditch on 2 February 1597. He was buried a few hundred yards from St. Leonard&#x27;s church, which is the burial ground for many other actors from this era. He died intestate (without a will). Having previously given his Blackfriars property to his son Richard and his personal property to his grandson Cuthbert, his widow presented an inventory valued at only £37. He died right before the lease expired on the Theatre, so after his passing his son Richard, rebuild a theatre across the Thames river and called it the Globe Theatre.

==James Burbage and The Theatre==

In 1576, Burbage and his partner John Brayne decided to create a new, permanent stage for London acting groups. It was one of the first permanent theatres to be built in London since the time of the Romans.

Brayne was Burbage&#x27;s brother-in-law and was considered a wealthy man. It was his investment (and the mortgage Burbage took out on the lease of the grounds) that allowed The Theatre to be built, with the two sharing the profits equally. Financial difficulties led Burbage and Brayne to stage plays in the building before construction was complete; the proceeds from these plays helping to finance the building&#x27;s completion.

Despite partnering with John Brayne, the lease of The Theatre&#x27;s site was signed by Burbage alone on 13 April 1576, to begin on 25 March 1576. Since Burbage owned the lease, he also received rent money for properties on the site. Under this lease, he paid roughly £14 a year. The exact builder of The Theatre is unknown, though a likely candidate is James Burbage&#x27;s brother Robert, who was a carpenter.

In 1594, a Privy Council order created the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men and gave it exclusive rights to play in the City of London at The Theatre. However, the lease on the land on which The Theatre was built would expire in1597. Burbage had not agreed a renewal with the landlord and invested instead in the building of the Blackfriars Theatre.

===Performance at The Theatre===

Burbage was very confident that spectators would come to The Theatre, even if they had to go through open fields to get there. One contemporary of the time referred to people streaming out of the city to see the plays there. The Theatre was considered a grand classical name. It was made mostly of wood, with ironwork scattered throughout. There was a tiring house for the players, and galleries and luxury seats providing better viewing and privacy. These seats would typically cost an extra penny or two pence, as opposed to a penny for the average attendee.

The Theatre was tested by the appearance of another playhouse, the Curtain Theatre, placed only 200 yards closer to the city walls. It was built by Henry Lanman (or Laneham), who had a close business relationship with Burbage and his associates. The two theatres pooled their profits together between the proprietors, using the Curtain Theatre to ease people into the more complex performances at The Theatre. As time went on, the shows in these playhouses became better organized, more popular, resourceful, and sophisticated in production. More playhouses such as The Rose and The Swan were built.

==The Blackfriars==

On 4 February 1596 Burbage purchased the Blackfriars Theatre property for £600. The building had once been a Dominican monastery in the south-west corner of London, but Burbage had plans to renovate the building into the English-speaking world&#x27;s first permanent, purpose-built indoor theatre. However, in November 1596, the residents of the district, led by Lady Elizabeth Russell, petitioned and managed to win a ban on play performances at the theatre. It was suggested that the stress of losing his business in this way contributed to Burbage&#x27;s death the following year.

<text>In computer science, a for-loop or for loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration. Specifically, a for-loop functions by running a section of code repeatedly until a certain condition has been satisfied.

For-loops have two parts: a header and a body. The header defines the iteration and the body is the code executed once per iteration. The header often declares an explicit loop counter or loop variable. This allows the body to know which iteration is being executed. For-loops are typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. For-loops can be thought of as shorthands for while-loops which increment and test a loop variable.

Various keywords are used to indicate the usage of a for loop: descendants of ALGOL use &quot;, while descendants of Fortran use &quot;. There are other possibilities, for example COBOL which uses .

The name &quot;for-loop&quot; comes from the word . &quot;For&quot; is used as the reserved word (or keyword) in many programming languages to introduce a for-loop. The term in English dates to ALGOL 58 and was popularized in ALGOL 60. It is the direct translation of the earlier German and was used in Superplan (1949–1951) by Heinz Rutishauser. Rutishauser was involved in defining ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60. The loop body is executed &quot;for&quot; the given values of the loop variable. This is more explicit in ALGOL versions of the for statement where a list of possible values and increments can be specified.

In Fortran and PL/I, the keyword is used for the same thing and it is named a &quot;do-loop&quot;; this is different from a &quot;do while loop&quot;.

==FOR==

A for-loop statement is available in most imperative programming languages. Even ignoring minor differences in syntax, there are many differences in how these statements work and the level of expressiveness they support. Generally, for-loops fall into one of four categories:

===Traditional for-loops===
The for-loop of languages like ALGOL, Simula, BASIC, Pascal, Modula, Oberon, Ada, MATLAB, OCaml, F#, and so on, requires a control variable with start- and end-values, which looks something like this:

for i = first to last do statement
(* or just *)
for i = first..last do statement

Depending on the language, an explicit assignment sign may be used in place of the equal sign (and some languages require the word even in the numerical case). An optional step-value (an increment or decrement ≠ 1) may also be included, although the exact syntaxes used for this differ a bit more between the languages. Some languages require a separate declaration of the control variable, some do not.

Another form was popularized by the C language. It requires 3 parts: the initialization (loop variant), the condition, and the advancement to the next iteration. All these three parts are optional. This type of &quot;semicolon loops&quot; came from B programming language and it was originally invented by Stephen Johnson.

In the initialization part, any variables needed are declared (and usually assigned values). If multiple variables are declared, they should all be the same type. The condition part checks a certain condition and exits the loop if false, even if the loop is never executed. If the condition is true, then the lines of code inside the loop are executed. The advancement to the next iteration part is performed exactly once every time the loop ends. The loop is then repeated if the condition evaluates to true.

Here is an example of the C-style traditional for-loop in Java.
// Prints the numbers from 0 to 99 (and not 100), each followed by a space.

for (int i=0; i&lt;100; i++)
 System.out.print(i);
 System.out.print(&#x27; &#x27;);
System.out.println();
These loops are also sometimes named &quot;numeric for-loops&quot; when contrasted with foreach loops (see below).

===Iterator-based for-loops===

This type of for-loop is a generalization of the numeric range type of for-loop, as it allows for the enumeration of sets of items other than number sequences. It is usually characterized by the use of an implicit or explicit iterator, in which the loop variable takes on each of the values in a sequence or other data collection. A representative example in Python is:
for an item in some_iterable_object:
 do_something()
 do_something_else()
Where is either a data collection that supports implicit iteration (like a list of employee&#x27;s names), or may be an iterator itself. Some languages have this in addition to another for-loop syntax; notably, PHP has this type of loop under the name , as well as a three-expression for-loop (see below) under the name .

===Vectorised for-loops===
Some languages offer a for-loop that acts as if processing all iterations in parallel, such as the keyword in Fortran 95 which has the interpretation that &quot;all&quot; right-hand-side expressions are evaluated before &quot;any&quot; assignments are made, as distinct from the explicit iteration form. For example, in the statement in the following pseudocode fragment, when calculating the new value for , except for the first (with ) the reference to will obtain the new value that had been placed there in the previous step. In the version, however, each calculation refers only to the original, unaltered .
 for i := 2 : N - 1 do A(i) := [A(i - 1) + A(i) + A(i + 1)] / 3; next i;
 for all i := 2 : N - 1 do A(i) := [A(i - 1) + A(i) + A(i + 1)] / 3;
The difference may be significant.

Some languages (such as PL/I, Fortran 95) also offer array assignment statements, that enable many for-loops to be omitted. Thus pseudocode such as would set all elements of array A to zero, no matter its size or dimensionality. The example loop could be rendered as

 A(2 : N - 1) := [A(1 : N - 2) + A(2 : N - 1) + A(3 : N)] / 3;

But whether that would be rendered in the style of the for-loop or the for-all-loop or something else may not be clearly described in the compiler manual.

===Compound for-loops===
Introduced with ALGOL 68 and followed by PL/I, this allows the iteration of a loop to be compounded with a test, as in
 for i := 1 : N while A(i) &gt; 0 do &quot;etc.&quot;
That is, a value is assigned to the loop variable &quot;i&quot; and only if the &quot;while expression&quot; is true will the loop body be executed. If the result were false the for-loop&#x27;s execution stops short. Granted that the loop variable&#x27;s value &quot;is&quot; defined after the termination of the loop, then the above statement will find the first non-positive element in array &quot;A&quot; (and if no such, its value will be &quot;N + 1&quot;), or, with suitable variations, the first non-blank character in a string, and so on.

==Loop counters==
In computer programming, a loop counter is a control variable that controls the iterations of a loop (a computer programming language construct). It is so named because most uses of this construct result in the variable taking on a range of integer values in some orderly sequences (for example., starting at 0 and ending at 10 in increments of 1)

Loop counters change with each iteration of a loop, providing a unique value for each iteration. The loop counter is used to decide when the loop should terminate and for the program flow to continue to the next instruction after the loop.

A common identifier naming convention is for the loop counter to use the variable names i, j, and k (and so on if needed), where i would be the most outer loop, j the next inner loop, etc. The reverse order is also used by some programmers. This style is generally agreed to have originated from the early programming of Fortran, where these variable names beginning with these letters were implicitly declared as having an integer type, and so were obvious choices for loop counters that were only temporarily required. The practice dates back further to mathematical notation where indices for sums and multiplications are often i, j, etc. A variant convention is the use of duplicated letters for the index, ii, jj, and kk, as this allows easier searching and search-replacing than using a single letter.

===Example===
An example of C code involving nested for loops, where the loop counter variables are i and j:
for (i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
 for (j = i; j &lt; 10; j++) {
 some_function(i, j);
}
Loops in C can also be used to print the reverse of a word. As:

for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++) {
 scanf(&quot;%c&quot;, &amp;a[i]);
for (i = 4; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
 printf(&quot;%c&quot;, a[i]);

Here, if the input is , the output will be .

==Additional semantics and constructs==
===Use as infinite loops===

This C-style for-loop is commonly the source of an infinite loop since the fundamental steps of iteration are completely in the control of the programmer. When infinite loops are intended, this type of for-loop can be used (with empty expressions), such as:
for (;;)
 //loop body
This style is used instead of infinite loops to avoid a type conversion warning in some C/C++ compilers. Some programmers prefer the more succinct form over the semantically equivalent but more verbose form.

===Early exit and continuation===
Some languages may also provide other supporting statements, which when present can alter how the for-loop iteration proceeds. Common among these are the break and continue statements found in C and its derivatives. The break statement causes the innermost loop to be terminated immediately when executed. The continue statement will move at once to the next iteration without further progress through the loop body for the current iteration. A for statement also terminates when a break, goto, or return statement within the statement body is executed.[Wells] Other languages may have similar statements or otherwise provide means to alter the for-loop progress; for example in Fortran 90:
DO I = 1, N
 statements!Executed for all values of &quot;I&quot;, up to a disaster if any.
 IF (no good) CYCLE! Skip this value of &quot;I&quot;, and continue with the next.
 Statements!Executed only where goodness prevails.
 IF (disaster) EXIT! Abandon the loop.
 Statements!While good and, no disaster.
END DO! Should align with the &quot;DO&quot;.
Some languages offer further facilities such as naming the various loop constructs so that with multiple nested loops there is no doubt as to which loop is involved. Fortran 90, for example:

X1:DO I = 1, N
 statements
 X2:DO J = 1, M
 statements
 IF (trouble) CYCLE X1
 statements
 END DO X2
 statements
 END DO X1

Thus, when &quot;trouble&quot; is detected in the inner loop, the CYCLE X1 (not X2) means that the skip will be to the next iteration for I, &quot;not&quot; J. The compiler will also be checking that each END DO has the appropriate label for its position: this is not just a documentation aid. The programmer must still code the problem correctly, but some possible blunders will be blocked.

===Loop variable scope and semantics===
Different languages specify different rules for what value the loop variable will hold on termination of its loop, and indeed some hold that it &quot;becomes undefined&quot;. This permits a compiler to generate code that leaves any value in the loop variable, or perhaps even leaves it unchanged because the loop value was held in a register and never stored in memory. Actual behavior may even vary according to the compiler&#x27;s optimization settings, as with the Honeywell Fortran66 compiler.

In some languages (not C or C++) the loop variable is immutable within the scope of the loop body, with any attempt to modify its value being regarded as a semantic error. Such modifications are sometimes a consequence of a programmer error, which can be very difficult to identify once made. However, only overt changes are likely to be detected by the compiler. Situations, where the address of the loop variable is passed as an argument to a subroutine, make it very difficult to check because the routine&#x27;s behavior is in general unknowable to the compiler unless the language supports procedure signatures and argument intents. Some examples in the style of pre-Fortran-90:
DO I = 1, N
 I = 7 !Overt adjustment of the loop variable. Compiler should complain
 Z = ADJUST(I) !Function &quot;ADJUST&quot; might alter &quot;I&quot;, to uncertain effect.
 PRINT *, (A(I), B(I), I = 1, N, 2) !Implicit for-loop to print odd elements of arrays A and B, reusing &quot;I&quot;... Compiler should complain.
 PRINT *, I ! What value will be presented?
END DO! How many times will the loop be executed?
A common approach is to calculate the iteration count at the start of a loop (with careful attention to overflow as in in sixteen-bit integer arithmetic) and with each iteration decrement this count while also adjusting the value of : double counting results. However, adjustments to the value of within the loop will not change the number of iterations executed.

Still, another possibility is that the code generated may employ an auxiliary variable as the loop variable, possibly held in a machine register, whose value may or may not be copied to on each iteration. Again, modifications of would not affect the control of the loop, but now a disjunction is possible: within the loop, references to the value of might be to the (possibly altered) current value of or to the auxiliary variable (held safe from improper modification) and confusing results are guaranteed. For instance, within the loop a reference to element of an array would likely employ the auxiliary variable (especially if it were held in a machine register), but if is a parameter to some routine (for instance, a &quot;print&quot;-statement to reveal its value), it would likely be a reference to the proper variable instead. It is best to avoid such possibilities.

====Adjustment of bounds====
Just as the index variable might be modified within a for-loop, so also may its bounds and direction. But to uncertain effect. A compiler may prevent such attempts, they may have no effect, or they might even work properly - though many would declare that to do so would be wrong. Consider a statement such as
 for i := first : last : step do
 A(i) := A(i) / A(last);
If the approach to compiling such a loop was to be the evaluation of , and and the calculation of an iteration count via something like once only at the start, then if those items were simple variables and their values were somehow adjusted during the iterations, this would have no effect on the iteration count even if the element selected for division by changed.

===List of value ranges===
ALGOL 60, PL/I, and ALGOL 68, allow loops in which the loop variable is iterated over a list of ranges of values instead of a single range. The following PL/I example will execute the loop with six values of i: 1, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15:

do i = 1, 7, 12 to 15;
 /*statements*/
end;
==Equivalence with while-loops==
A for-loop is generally equivalent to a while-loop:

 factorial := 1
 for counter from 2 to 5
 factorial := factorial * counter
 counter:= counter - 1
 print counter + &quot;! equals &quot; + factorial

Is equivalent to:

 factorial := 1
 counter := 1
 while counter &lt; 5
 counter := counter + 1
 factorial := factorial * counter
 print counter + &quot;! equals &quot; + factorial

As demonstrated by the output of the variables.

==Timeline of the &quot;for-loop&quot; syntax in various programming languages==
Given an action that must be repeated, for instance, five times, different languages&#x27; for-loops will be written differently. The syntax for a three-expression for-loop is nearly identical in all languages that have it, after accounting for different styles of block termination and so on.

===1957: FORTRAN===

Fortran&#x27;s equivalent of the loop is the loop,
using the keyword do instead of for,
The syntax of Fortran&#x27;s loop is:

 DO label counter = first, last, step
 statements
label statement

The following two examples behave equivalently to the three argument for-loop in other languages,
initializing the counter variable to 1, incrementing by 1 each iteration of the loop, and stopping at five (inclusive).

 DO 9, ICOUNT = 1, 5, 1
 WRITE (6,8) ICOUNT
 8 FORMAT( I2 )
 9 CONTINUE

As of Fortran 90, block structured was added to the language. With this, the end of loop label became optional:

do icounter = 1, 5
 write(*, &#x27;(i2)&#x27;) icounter
end do

The step part may be omitted if the step is one. Example:

* DO loop example.
 PROGRAM MAIN
 INTEGER SUMSQ
 SUMSQ = 0
 DO 199 I = 1, 9999999
 IF (SUMSQ.GT.1000) GO TO 200
199 SUMSQ = SUMSQ + I**2
200 PRINT 206, SUMSQ
206 FORMAT( I2 )
 END
In Fortran 90, the may be avoided by using an statement.

* DO loop example.
 program main
 implicit none

 integer:: sums
 integer:: i

 sums = 0
 do i = 1, 9999999
 if (sums &gt; 1000.0) exit
 sums = sums + i**2
 end do
 print *, sums

 end program
===1958: ALGOL===

ALGOL 58 introduced the statement, using the form as Superplan:

 FOR &quot;Identifier&quot; = &quot;Base&quot; (&quot;Difference&quot;) &quot;Limit&quot;

For example to print 0 to 10 incremented by 1:
===1960: COBOL===

COBOL was formalized in late 1959 and has had many elaborations. It uses the PERFORM verb which has many options. Originally all loops had to be out-of-line with the iterated code occupying a separate paragraph. Ignoring the need for declaring and initializing variables, the COBOL equivalent of a &quot;for&quot;-loop would be.
 PERFORM SQ-ROUTINE VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I &gt; 1000

 SQ-ROUTINE
 ADD I**2 TO SUM-SQ.
In the 1980s, the addition of in-line loops and &quot;structured programming&quot; statements such as END-PERFORM resulted in a &quot;for&quot;-loop with a more familiar structure.
 PERFORM VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I &gt; 1000
 ADD I**2 TO SUM-SQ.
 END-PERFORM

If the PERFORM verb has the optional clause TEST AFTER, the resulting loop is slightly different: the loop body is executed at least once, before any test.

===1964: BASIC===

In BASIC, a loop is sometimes named a &quot;for-next loop&quot;.
10 REM THIS FOR LOOP PRINTS ODD NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 15
20 FOR I = 1 TO 15 STEP 2
30 PRINT I
40 NEXT I

The end-loop marker specifies the name of the index variable, which must correspond to the name of the index variable at the start of the for-loop. Some languages (PL/I, Fortran 95, and later) allow a statement label at the start of a for-loop that can be matched by the compiler against the same text on the corresponding end-loop statement. Fortran also allows the and statements to name this text; in a nest of loops, this makes clear which loop is intended. However, in these languages, the labels must be unique, so successive loops involving the same index variable cannot use the same text nor can a label be the same as the name of a variable, such as the index variable for the loop.

===1964: PL/I===
do counter = 1 to 5 by 1; /* &quot;by 1&quot; is the default if not specified */
 /*statements*/;
 end;
The statement may be used to exit the loop. Loops can be labeled, and &quot;leave&quot; may leave a specific labeled loop in a group of nested loops. Some PL/I dialects include the statement to terminate the current loop iteration and begin the next.

===1968: ALGOL 68===

ALGOL 68 has what was considered &quot;the&quot; universal loop, the full syntax is:
Further, the single iteration range could be replaced by a list of such ranges. There are several unusual aspects of the construct
* only the portion was compulsory, in which case the loop will iterate indefinitely.
* thus the clause , will iterate exactly 100 times.
* The &quot;syntactic element&quot; allowed a programmer to break from a loop early, as in:
Subsequent &quot;extensions&quot; to the standard ALGOL 68 allowed the syntactic element to be replaced with and to achieve a small optimization. The same compilers also incorporated:
;: for late loop termination.
;: for working on arrays in parallel.

===1970: Pascal===
for Counter:= 1 to 5 do
 (*statement*);
Decrementing (counting backwards) is using keyword instead of , as in:
for Counter:= 5 down to 1 do
 (*statement*);
The numeric range for-loop varies somewhat more.

===1972: C, C++===
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
 statement

The is often a block statement; an example of this would be:

//Using for-loops to add numbers 1 - 5
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 5; ++i) {
 sum += i;

The ISO/IEC 9899:1999 publication (commonly known as C99) also allows initial declarations in loops. All three sections in the for loop are optional, with an empty condition equivalent to true.

===1972: Smalltalk===

1 to: 5 do: [ :counter | &quot;statements&quot; ]
Contrary to other languages, in Smalltalk a for-loop is not a language construct but is defined in the class Number as a method with two parameters, the end value and a closure, using self as start value.

===1980: Ada===
for Counter in 1 .. 5 loop
 -- statements
end loop;
The &quot;exit&quot; statement may be used to exit the loop. Loops can be labeled, and &quot;exit&quot; may leave a specifically labeled loop in a group of nested loops:

Counting:
 For Counter in 1 .. 5 loop
 Triangle:
 for Secondary_Index in 2 .. Counter loop
 -- statements
 exit Counting;
 -- statements
 end loop Triangle;
 end loop Counting;
===1980: Maple===

Maple has two forms of for-loop, one for iterating over a range of values, and the other for iterating over the contents of a container. The value range form is as follows:

 for &quot;i&quot; from &quot;f&quot; by &quot;b&quot; to &quot;t&quot; while &quot;w&quot; do
 &quot;# loop body&quot;
 od;

All parts except codice_1 and codice_2 are optional. The codice_3 part, if present, must come first. The remaining parts (codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7) can appear in any order.

Iterating over a container is done using this form of loop:

 for &quot;e&quot; in &quot;c&quot; while &quot;w&quot; do
 &quot;# loop body&quot;
 od;

The codice_8 clause specifies the container, which may be a list, set, sum, product, unevaluated function, array, or object implementing an iterator.

A for-loop may be terminated by codice_2, codice_10, or codice_11.

===1982: Maxima CAS===

In Maxima CAS, one can use also integer values:

for x:0.5 step 0.1 thru 0.9 do
 /* &quot;Do something with x&quot; */
===1982: PostScript===

The for-loop, written as initializes an internal variable, and executes the body as long as the internal variable is not more than the limit (or not less, if the increment is negative) and, at the end of each iteration, increments the internal variable. Before each iteration, the value of the internal variable is pushed onto the stack.

1 1 6 {STATEMENTS} for

There is also a simple repeat loop.
The repeat-loop, written as , repeats the body exactly X times.

5 { STATEMENTS } repeat
===1983: Ada 83 and above===
procedure Main is
 Sum_Sq : Integer := 0;
begin
 for I in 1 .. 9999999 loop
 if Sum_Sq &lt;= 1000 then
 Sum_Sq := Sum_Sq + I**2
 end if;
 end loop;
end;
===1984: MATLAB===
for n = 1:5
 -- statements
end
After the loop, would be 5 in this example.

As is used for the Imaginary unit, its use as a loop variable is discouraged.

===1987: Perl===
for ($counter = 1; $counter &lt;= 5; $counter++) { # implicitly or predefined variable
 # statements;
for (my $counter = 1; $counter &lt;= 5; $counter++) { # variable private to the loop
 # statements;
for (1..5) { # variable implicitly called $_; 1..5 creates a list of these 5 elements
 # statements;
statement for 1..5; # almost same (only 1 statement) with natural language order
for my $counter (1..5) { # variable private to the loop
 # statements;


&quot;There&#x27;s more than one way to do it&quot; is a Perl programming motto.

===1988: Mathematica===

The construct corresponding to most other languages&#x27; for-loop is named &quot;Do&quot; in Mathematica.
Do[f[x], {x, 0, 1, 0.1}]
Mathematica also has a For construct that mimics the for-loop of C-like languages.
For[x= 0 , x &lt;= 1, x += 0.1,
 f[x]


===1989: Bash===
# first form
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
 # must have at least one command in a loop
 echo $i # just print the value of i
done

# second form
for (( i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++ ))
do
 # must have at least one command in a loop
 echo $i # just print the value of i
done
An empty loop (i.e., one with no commands between and ) is a syntax error. If the above loops contained only comments, execution would result in the message &quot;syntax error near unexpected token &#x27;done&#x27;&quot;.

===1990: Haskell===
In Haskell98, the function &quot;mapM_&quot; maps a monadic function over a list, as

mapM_ print [4, 3 .. 1]
-- prints
-- 4
-- 3
-- 2
-- 1
The function &quot;mapM&quot; collects each iteration result in a list:

result_list &lt;- mapM (\ indx -&gt; do{ print indx; return (indx - 1) }) [1..4]
-- prints
-- 1
-- 2
-- 3
-- 4
-- result_list is [0,1,2,3,4]
Haskell2010 adds functions &quot;forM_&quot; and &quot;forM&quot;, which are equivalent to &quot;mapM_&quot; and &quot;mapM&quot;, but with their arguments flipped:

forM_ [0..3] $ \ indx -&gt; do
 print indx
-- prints
-- 0
-- 1
-- 2
-- 3

result_list &lt;- forM [&#x27;a&#x27;..&#x27;d&#x27;] $ \ indx -&gt; do
 print indx
 return indx
-- prints
-- &#x27;a&#x27;
-- &#x27;b&#x27;
-- &#x27;c&#x27;
-- &#x27;d&#x27;
-- result_list is [&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;b&#x27;,&#x27;c&#x27;,&#x27;d&#x27;]
When compiled with optimization, none of the expressions above will create lists. But, to save the space of the [1..5] list if optimization is turned off, a &quot;forLoop_&quot; function could be defined as
import Control.Monad as M

forLoop_ :: Monad m =&gt; a -&gt; (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; (a -&gt; a) -&gt; (a -&gt; m ()) -&gt; m ()
forLoop_ startIndx test next f = theLoop startIndx
 where
 theLoop indx = M.when (test indx) $ do
 f indx
 theLoop (next indx)

and used as

forLoopM_ (0::Int) (&lt; len) (+1) $ \indx -&gt; do
 -- statements
===1991: Oberon-2, Oberon-07, Component Pascal===
FOR Counter:= 1 TO 5 DO
 (* statement sequence *)
END

In the original Oberon language, the for-loop was omitted in favor of the more general Oberon loop construct. The for-loop was reintroduced in Oberon-2.

===1991: Python===

Python does not contain the classical for loop, rather a codice_12 loop is used to iterate over the output of the built-in codice_13 function which returns an iterable sequence of integers.
for i in range(1, 6): # gives i values from 1 to 5 inclusive (but not 6)
 # statements
 print(i)
# if we want 6 we must do the following
for i in range(1, 6 + 1): # gives i values from 1 to 6
 # statements
 print(i)
Using codice_14 would run the loop from 0 to 5.

When the loop variable is not needed, it is common practice to use an underscore (codice_15) as a placeholder. This convention signals to other developers that the variable will not be used inside the loop. For example:

for _ in range(5):
 print(&quot;Hello&quot;)

This will print “Hello” five times without using the loop variable.

===1993: AppleScript===
repeat with i from 1 to 5
 -- statements
 log i
end repeat
It can also iterate through a list of items, similar to what can be done with arrays in other languages:

set x to {1, &quot;waffles&quot;, &quot;bacon&quot;, 5.1, false}
repeat with i in x
 log i
end repeat
A may also be used to exit a loop at any time. Unlike other languages, AppleScript currently has no command to continue to the next iteration of a loop.

===1993: Crystal===
for i = start, stop, interval do
 -- statements
end

So, this code 
for i = 1, 5, 2 do
 print(i)
end will print:
1 3 5

For-loops can also loop through a table using ipairs() to iterate numerically through arrays and pairs() to iterate randomly through dictionaries.
Generic for-loop making use of closures:
for name, phone, and address in contacts() do
 -- contacts() must be an iterator function
end

===1995: ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML)===
====Script syntax====
Simple index loop:

for (i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++) {
 // statements


Using an array:

for (i in [1,2,3,4,5]) {
 // statements


Using a list of string values:

loop index=&quot;i&quot; list=&quot;1;2,3;4,5&quot; delimiters=&quot;,;&quot; {
 // statements


The above example is only available in the dialect of CFML used by Lucee and Railo.

====Tag syntax====

Simple index loop:

&lt;cfloop index=&quot;i&quot; from=&quot;1&quot; to=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!--- statements ---&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
Using an array:

&lt;cfloop index=&quot;i&quot; array=&quot;#[1,2,3,4,5]#&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!--- statements ---&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
Using a &quot;list&quot; of string values:

&lt;cfloop index=&quot;i&quot; list=&quot;1;2,3;4,5&quot; delimiters=&quot;,;&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!--- statements ---&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
===1995: Java===
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
 //perform functions within the loop;
 //can use the statement &#x27;break;&#x27; to exit early;
 //can use the statement &#x27;continue;&#x27; to skip the current iteration


For the extended for-loop, see .

===1995: JavaScript===

JavaScript supports C-style &quot;three-expression&quot; loops. The and statements are supported inside loops.
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
}
Alternatively, it is possible to iterate over all keys of an array.
for (var key in array) { // also works for assoc. arrays
 // use array[key]
}
===1995: PHP===

This prints out a triangle of *

for ($i = 0; $i &lt;= 5; $i++) {
 for ($j = 0; $j &lt;= $i; $j++) {
 echo &quot;*&quot;;
 echo &quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&quot;;


===1995: Ruby===
for the counter in 1..5
 # statements
end

5.times do |counter| # counter iterates from 0 to 4
 # statements
end

1.upto(5) do |counter|
 # statements
end

Ruby has several possible syntaxes, including the above samples.

===1996: OCaml===

See expression syntax.

 (* for_statement:= &quot;for&quot; ident &#x27;=&#x27; expr ( &quot;to&quot; ∣ &quot;down to&quot; ) expr &quot;do&quot; expr &quot;done&quot; *)

for i = 1 to 5 do
 (* statements *)
 done ;;

for j = 5 down to 0 do
 (* statements *)
 done ;;
===1998: ActionScript 3===
for (var counter:uint = 1; counter &lt;= 5; counter++){
 //statement;


===2008: Small Basic===
For i = 1 To 10
 &#x27; Statements
EndFor
===2008: Nim===

Nim has a codice_12-type loop and various operations for creating iterators.

for i in 5 .. 10:
 # statements
===2009: Go===
for i := 0; i &lt;= 10; i++ {
 // statements


===2010: Rust===
for i in 0..10 {
 // statements


===2012: Julia===
for j = 1:10
 # statements
end

<text>Blaise de Vigenère (5 April 1523 – 19 February 1596) () was a French diplomat, cryptographer, translator and alchemist.

== Biography ==

Vigenère was born into a respectable family in the village of Saint-Pourçain in Bourbonnais. When he was 12, his father, Jehan (modern spelling Jean) de Vigenère, arranged for him to have a classical education in Paris. Registered at the university at 14, he quit after three years without a known degree.

From 1539 to around 1545, he worked under Gilbert Bayard, a first secretary to King Francis I, who had fiefs in Bourbonnais.

In 1545, he accompanied the French envoy Louis Adhémar de Monteil, Count of Grignan, to the Diet of Worms as a junior secretary. After the diet&#x27;s rupture, he traveled in Europe.

In 1547, he quit the court and entered the service of the House of Nevers. He would remain associated with it until at least a year before his death in 1596. At first he was secretary to François I, Duke of Nevers, a position he held until the deaths of the duke and his son in 1562. A letter of July 1593 reveals he was also secretary to Louis de Gonzague (who became Duke of Nevers by his marriage to François I&#x27;s daughter Henriette of Cleves in 1565) and tutored Louis&#x27; son (born 1580).

In 1549, he took his first trip to Italy, in particular to Rome. It is not known who his protector was on the trip, which lasted for three to four years, but one of his biographers, Maurice Sarazin, has suggested it may have been Cardinal Tournon, a celebrated diplomat and friend of the arts. He would return to Rome again in 1566 for another three years. During his stays, he examined all the ancient buildings and expanded his knowledge of antiquity. In his 1586 book, &quot;Traicté des chiffres ou secretes manières d&#x27;escrire&quot;, he wrote:
in Rome, I did all that was possible — talking to learned men versed in Roman antiquity, visiting and revisiting the marble reliefs, bronzes, medals and ancient cameos from which one might draw knowledge and instruction — but I couldn&#x27;t restore anything.

After the death of François II, Duke of Nevers, in 1562, Vigenère resumed his studies. He received lessons from Adrianus Turnebus and Jean Dorat and learned Greek and Hebrew.

In 1566, the queen mother, Catherine de Médicis, sent Vignère to Rome, where he was secretary under Juste de Tournon, the ambassador of her son King Charles IX. In December of that year she sent a letter to Tournon, requesting that Vigenère respond to an overture made by the secretary of the elderly king of Poland, Sigismond Auguste Jagellon, who had no children. Apparently the secretary had proposed the Polish king name her son Henri (the Duke of Anjou and future King Henry III of France), as his successor. She specified Vigenère should interview the Polish diplomat verbally, verifying the proposal&#x27;s authenticity, then facilitate the idea, all without revealing he had been authorized to do so by her. Nine years later, Vigenère wrote in detail about this incident in his book &quot;La description du Royaume de Poloigne&quot;, without naming himself or revealing that he could have held secrets.

During this later stay in Italy, Vigenère also visited other Italian cities, notably Venice and Florence.

In 1570, at age 47, Vigenère retired from traveling and settled in Paris to devote himself to writing. He donated his 1,000 livres a year income to the poor in Paris. He married Marie Varé on 24 July 1570.

He died of throat cancer in 1596 and is buried in the Saint-Étienne-du-Mont church.

== Vigenère cipher ==

On Vigenère&#x27;s trips to Italy he read books about cryptography and came in contact with cryptologists. Giovan Battista Bellaso described a method of encryption in his 1553 book &quot;La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Battista Belaso&quot;, published in Venice in 1553, which in the 19th century was misattributed to Vigenère and became widely known as the &quot;Vigenère cipher&quot;. In 1567 and 1568, Vigenère created a different, stronger autokey cipher, which he published in 1586 in his book &quot;Traicté des chiffres ou secrètes manières d&#x27;escrire&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Ciphers or Secret Ways of Writing&quot;). It differs from Bellaso&#x27;s in several ways: 
* Bellaso used a &quot;reciprocal table&quot; of five alphabets; Vigenère used ten;
* Bellaso&#x27;s cipher was based on the first letter of the word; Vigenère used a letter agreed upon before communication.

<doc id="468929" wikidata="Q818193" url="?curid=468929" title="Bensonhurst, Brooklyn">
<text>Bensonhurst is a residential neighborhood in the southwestern section of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The neighborhood is bordered on the northwest by 14th Avenue, on the northeast by 60th Street, on the southeast by Avenue P and 22nd Avenue (Bay Parkway) and on the southwest by 86th Street. It is adjacent to the neighborhoods of Dyker Heights to the northwest, Borough Park and Mapleton to the northeast, Bath Beach to the southwest, and Gravesend to the southeast.

Bensonhurst contains several major ethnic enclaves. It was traditionally known as a Little Italy of Brooklyn. Bensonhurst today is home to Brooklyn&#x27;s second Chinatown and has the largest population of residents born in China and Hong Kong of any neighborhood in New York City. The neighborhood accounts for 9.5% of the 330,000 Chinese-born residents of the city, based on data from 2007 to 2011.

Bensonhurst is part of Brooklyn Community District 11, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11204 and 11214. It is patrolled by the 62nd Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 38th, 43rd, and 47th Districts.

==Etymology and history==

Bensonhurst derives its name from Egbert Benson (1789–1866), whose children and grandchildren sold his lands to James D. Lynch, a New York real estate developer. Lynch bought the old farmlands from the Benson family in the mid-1880s, and by 1888, began selling private lots in an area dubbed as Bensonhurst-by-the-Sea, now Bath Beach. The first sale of lands in &quot;The New Seaside Resort&quot; area was advertised in the July 24, 1888, issue of the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;.

Through the mid-20th century, Bensonhurst developed as an Italian and Jewish enclave. Despite a wave of commercial development in the 1980s, some land had remained undeveloped by then. By the early 2000s, condominiums were being built in Bensonhurst, and it had turned into a diverse community of Italian, Chinese, Mexican, Middle Eastern, and Russian residents. The neighborhood, along with adjoining neighborhoods have been called &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Chinatown&quot;.

==Demographics==
Based on data from the 2020 United States census, the population of Bensonhurst was 104,934, Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 43.9% (43,064) Asian, 34.8% (36,545) White, 1.0% (1,078) African American, 0.6% (600) from other races, and 2.5% (2,613) from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 17.2% (18,064) of the population.

The entirety of Community Board 11 had 204,829 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 83.8 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 20% are between the ages of 0–17, 31% between 25 and 44, and 26% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 8% and 15% respectively.

As of 2016, the median household income in Community District 12 was $53,493. In 2018, an estimated 23% of Bensonhurst residents lived in poverty, compared to 21% in all of Brooklyn and 20% in all of New York City. Less than one in ten residents (8%) were unemployed, compared to 9% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 52% in Bensonhurst, about the same as the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Bensonhurst is considered to be low-income and not gentrifying relative to the rest of the city.

As of the 2020 census data from NYC Dept. Of City Planning, there were 46,000 Asian residents surpassing the remaining White residents of 30,000 to 39,999 for the first time in history. The Hispanic population has also grown significantly to between 10,000 and 19,999 residents.

==Ethnic enclaves==

In the early 20th century, many Italians and Jewish migrants moved into the neighborhood, and prior to World War II, the neighborhood was about equally Jewish and Italian. In the 1940s an influx of immigrants from southern Italy moved in, leaving the area predominantly Italian.

Around 1989, an influx of immigrants from China and the former USSR began to arrive, mainly from Southern China, Russia, and Ukraine. In the 1990s, Bensonhurst rapidly grew in cultural diversity. Bensonhurst is home to many ethnic Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Albanian, Georgian, Uzbek, Tajik, Arab, Egyptian, Pakistani, Mexican, and Guatemalan Americans. In 1994, &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited the growing influx of Russian-speaking, Asian, and Hispanic populations in the area.

In 2000, the New York City Department of City Planning determined that just over half of the residents were born in another country. By 2013, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that the city&#x27;s foreign-born population had reached a record high, and that Bensonhurst had the city&#x27;s second-highest number of foreign-born people with 77,700 foreign-born immigrants in the neighborhood, just after Washington Heights.

===Little Italy===
With a large Italian-American population, Bensonhurst is usually considered the main &quot;Little Italy&quot; of Brooklyn. The Italian-speaking community was over 20,000 strong in the census of 2000. The Italian-speaking community, though, is becoming &quot;increasingly elderly and isolated, with the small, tight-knit enclave in the city slowly disappearing as they give way to demographic changes.&quot; Despite changing demographics over the recent years, Bensonhurst is home to the largest Italian speaking community outside of Italy and is home to the largest Sicilian and Neapolitan speaking communities outside of Sicily and Naples, respectively.

Its main thoroughfare, 18th Avenue (also known as Cristoforo Colombo Boulevard) between roughly 60th Street and Shore Parkway, is lined with predominantly small, Italian family-owned businesses—many of which have remained in the same family for several generations. 86th Street is another popular local thoroughfare, located under the elevated BMT West End Line.

After Italy&#x27;s World Cup victory in 2006, over 50,000 flocked to 18th Avenue for an all-day party.

The annual Festa di Santa Rosalia (commonly known as &quot;the Feast&quot; to locals), is held on 18th Avenue from Bay Ridge Parkway (75th Street) to 66th Street in late August or early September. &quot;The Feast&quot; is presented by Bensonhurst resident and marketer Franco Corrado, as well as by the Santa Rosalia Society, on 18th Avenue. Born in Rome in 1955, Corrado has been an active social member of the Italian-American community for the past 20 years. St. Rosalia is the patron saint of the city of Palermo and is sometimes venerated as the patron for the entire island of Sicily. The annual end-of-summer celebration attracts thousands. Bensonhurst also hosts a Columbus Day parade.

Like Lower Manhattan&#x27;s Little Italy, Bensonhurst&#x27;s Little Italy and its Italian-American population is declining, with the rapid expansion of its Chinatown and Chinese population.

In the 2020 United States Census, Italian-Americans constituted 9.2% of the population of Bensonhurst.

===Little Hong Kong/Little Guangdong===
Below the West End Line, served by the along 86th Street between 18th Avenue and the intersection with Stillwell Avenue, is a rapidly growing Brooklyn Chinatown. In the 2000s it was intermixed with Italian, Jewish, and Russian residents, but in the 2010s, most of the new businesses between 18th Avenue and 25th Avenue, have been Chinese. 86th Street is home to a growing number of Chinese restaurants, including the 86 Wong Chinese Restaurant (one of the earliest Chinese businesses established in Bensonhurst), as well as Chinese grocery stores, salons, bakeries, and other types of businesses. The subway directly connects to Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown, and indirectly to the Chinatown in Sunset Park, which is served by the at the 8th Avenue station.

With the large migration of the Cantonese and some Fuzhouese people in Brooklyn now to Bensonhurst, as well as new Chinese immigration, other clusters of Chinese businesses and residences have also started to emerge in other parts of Bensonhurst such as 18th Avenue and Bay Parkway, creating other newer small emerging Chinatowns in Bensonhurst in addition to the one on 86th Street under the D train. These are connected to the Sunset Park Chinatown by the .

The newly emerging Chinese enclaves in sections of Bensonhurst, and another one in Homecrest/Sheepshead Bay, are primarily Cantonese populated and are more of extensions of the Western Cantonese section of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown or Little Hong Kong / Little Guangdong or Cantonese Town. However, there are also small numbers are Fuzhou- and Mandarin-speakers.

The Flushing-based New World Mall, which owns and operates a Chinese supermarket called Jmart Supermarket inside their shopping center, opened a second branch of Jmart Supermarket in Bensonhurst in 2018. It is the neighborhood&#x27;s largest Chinese Asian style supermarket. The Jmart is located in a former Waldbaum&#x27;s.

Bensonhurst&#x27;s Chinese population was 31,658 in 2015, with this population being primarily Cantonese-speaking from Mainland China&#x27;s Guangdong Province and Hong Kong. The majority of Brooklyn&#x27;s Cantonese population is concentrated in Bensonhurst, and is slowly replacing Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown as the largest primary Cantonese cultural center in New York City resulting in Bensonhurst increasingly becoming the main largest attraction for newly arriving Cantonese immigrants into New York City with Homecrest/Sheepshead Bay as a smaller secondary attraction.

In 2011, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown Chinese population dropped from 34,554 to 28,681 from 2000 to 2010, and that it is continuing to decline due to the gentrification going on in Lower Manhattan, which has spurred the increasing growth of newer Chinatowns in Brooklyn including in Queens. As of the 2010s, the current Chinese population in Bensonhurst has grown so much that it is enough to create another large Chinatown surpassing Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown and nearly being as big as Sunset Park&#x27;s Chinatown. However, unlike in Sunset Park where the Chinese community is highly concentrated, the Chinese community in Bensonhurst is split into several sections, such as 18th Avenue, Bay Parkway, and 86th Street.

Brooklyn&#x27;s Asian population, mainly Chinese, has grown substantially in the Sunset Park area, as well as in Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights, and Borough Park. In Bensonhurst alone, from 2000 to 2010, the Asian population increased by 57%. The study showed that Asians very often live in houses that are divided into studio apartments, which means the Asian population could be higher than indicated on censuses.

Based on data from the 2020 United States census, the Asian population in Bensonhurst grew to 46,000, surpassing the Asian populations in Sunset Park of 31,000 and in the original Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown of 27,000. Bensonhurst has the third-largest Asian population of any New York City neighborhood, behind Elmhurst with a population in excess of 55,000 and Flushing with 54,000. While the original Chinatown in Manhattan saw a decline in the Asian population, all these other neighborhoods have continued to experience Asian population increases.

For the first time as of the 2020 census data from NYC Dept. Of City Planning, the Asian population(46,000 residents) in Bensonhurst now constitute a more than 50% majority in the neighborhood now surpassing the remaining White population (30,000 to 39,999 residents). Nearby adjacent neighborhoods of Gravesend has 26,700 Asian residents and Dyker Heights has between 20,000 and 29,999 Asian residents and Bath Beach has between 10,000 and 19,999 Asian residents. The Asian population in the Dyker Heights/Bensonhurst/Gravesend/Bath Beach area all together approximately made up around roughly 102,700 residents more or less and remain primarily Chinese speaking.

There is a small significant amount of Vietnamese Chinese residents integrated into the community, particularly west of Bay Parkway going towards Dyker Heights.

Chinese translation terms Bensonhurst as 本森社区.

====New York City&#x27;s largest Hong Kong community====
Bensonhurst and the nearby neighborhood of Bath Beach collectively have the largest concentration of Hong Kong immigrants in New York City.

== Land use and terrain ==
Many of Bensonhurst&#x27;s houses are attached or semidetached, though fully detached houses can be found in the west near Dyker Heights. These are mostly 20th-century houses made of brick, stucco, and stone, with aluminum siding facades. There are also clusters of apartment buildings throughout the neighborhood. After rezoning in the 2000s, many short single-family homes were torn down and replaced by three-story brick apartment buildings and multi-family condominiums.

They are sometimes called &quot;Fedders Houses&quot; for their distinctive, standard air conditioner sleeves. From 2002 to 2005, 1,200 new housing units in Bensonhurst were approved to accommodate the growing population, which includes many foreign-born residents. With an increase in the area&#x27;s real estate values, long-time homeowners sold their houses.
As no official neighborhood designations are used in New York City, Bensonhurst does not have any official boundaries. Still, parts of Bath Beach, Mapleton, Dyker Heights, Gravesend, and Borough Park are sometimes considered parts of Bensonhurst. However, Bensonhurst-proper includes the area bounded by 86th Street, 14th Avenue, 60th Street, McDonald Avenue, Avenue P, Stillwell Ave. and Bay Parkway.

== Police and crime ==
The NYPD&#x27;s 62nd Precinct is located at 1925 Bath Avenue.

The 62nd Precinct ranked 4th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. Historically, Bensonhurst has had lower crime than other neighborhoods in Brooklyn, though its mostly White and Asian population has made the area susceptible to racially-motivated crimes, such as the murder of Yusef Hawkins in 1989.

, with a non-fatal assault rate of 23 per 100,000 people, Bensonhurst&#x27;s rate of violent crimes per capita is less than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 152 per 100,000 people is lower than that of the city as a whole.

The Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 87.4% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 2 murders, 20 rapes, 120 robberies, 148 felony assaults, 178 burglaries, 482 grand larcenies, and 67 grand larcenies auto in 2018.

== Fire safety ==
The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) operates two firehouses in the area. Engine Co. 330/Ladder Co. 172 is located at 2312 65th Street. Engine Co. 253 is located at 2429 86th Street.

== Health ==
, preterm births and births to teenage mothers are less common in Bensonhurst than in other places citywide. In Bensonhurst, there were 84 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 87 per 1,000 citywide), and 12.5 births to teenage mothers per 1,000 live births (compared to 19.3 per 1,000 citywide). Bensonhurst has a high population of residents who are uninsured, or who receive healthcare through Medicaid. In 2018, this population of uninsured residents was estimated to be 13%, which is higher than the citywide rate of 12%.

The concentration of fine particulate matter, the deadliest type of air pollutant, in Bensonhurst is , lower than the citywide and boroughwide averages. Sixteen percent of Bensonhurst residents are smokers, which is higher the city average of 14% of residents being smokers.

<text>The City Loop (originally called the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop or MURL) is a piece of underground commuter rail infrastructure in the central business district (CBD) of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

The loop includes three underground stations: Flagstaff, Melbourne Central (formerly Museum) and Parliament. The loop connects to Melbourne&#x27;s two busiest stations, Flinders Street and Southern Cross, and together with the Flinders Street Viaduct forms a ring of four individual tracks around the CBD.

Eleven metropolitan lines of the Melbourne rail network run through the City Loop, organised into four separate groups, the Burnley/City Circle, Caulfield, Clifton Hill, and Northern groups. Each group has its own dedicated single-track tunnel, with trains running on balloon loops around the CBD. The Loop follows La Trobe and Spring Streets along the northern and eastern edges of the CBD&#x27;s street grid.

Although concepts for an underground railway had been raised since the 1920s, planning was not seriously progressed until the 1960s. The 1970 Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Act finalised the design and established an authority to oversee construction of the project. Tunnelling works began in 1972 and the Loop commenced operation in 1981 with the opening of Museum station, now Melbourne Central. The loop was fully complete in 1985 with the opening of Flagstaff station.

A new CBD rail tunnel, the Metro Tunnel, is currently under construction to relieve pressure on the City Loop, and when it opens in 2025 will see the Pakenham, Cranbourne and Sunbury metropolitan lines removed from the loop.

==History==
Before the City Loop was constructed, Flinders Street and Spencer Street (now called Southern Cross) stations were connected only by the four track Flinders Street Viaduct beside the Yarra River. The suburban terminus of Flinders Street had become seriously congested by the 1970s, with a throughput of only ten trains per platform per hour (roughly 1,700 trains a day) — compared to a maximum of 24 if there was through running. Many trains were through routed from the southern and eastern suburbs to the north and west, but the flow was imbalanced and a number of trains were required to reverse their direction. The Epping and Hurstbridge lines stood alone from the rest of the network, having Princes Bridge station for their own exclusive use.

Several plans had been proposed over the preceding decades to alleviate the bottleneck. The one that was adopted was the building of a circular railway allowing trains to continue past Flinders Street, loop around and return to the suburbs. It was expected to boost platform capacity, allowing more trains per platform per hour on the same number of Flinders Street platforms. The loop would also bring train commuters directly into the northern and eastern sections of the CBD, delivering workers closer to their offices, students closer to RMIT University, and government officials directly to the Parliament buildings. Although the city&#x27;s tram network already covered the CBD extensively, trams are not as efficient as trains when bringing large numbers of commuters into the city.

===Planning===

Plans for an underground city railway in Melbourne are almost as old as electrification of the network itself. In 1929, the Metropolitan Town Planning Commission released a report recommending an underground city bypass from Richmond to North Melbourne stations via Exhibition and Victoria streets. The 1940 Victorian Railways Ashworth Improvement Plan recommended a different approach, with additional platforms at the Flinders Street/Princes Bridge station complex to be built over two levels, along with a connection to an underground City Railway. The Victorian Railways promoted another route in 1950 as part of the Operation Phoenix rehabilitation plan, the line running from Richmond towards Jolimont station, under the Fitzroy Gardens and Lonsdale Street then turning north to North Melbourne station. A branch line turned north from William Street, and went through the Flagstaff Gardens. In 1954 the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Board of Works released their Planning Scheme for Melbourne report, which included the Richmond – North Melbourne Lonsdale Street route.

A Parliamentary Committee on Public Works reported favourably on a city loop in 1954, and in 1958 a City Underground Railway Committee was appointed by the Transport Minister. It stated bluntly that the aim of the loop was not just to relieve crowding at Flinders Street, but to win back patronage from private cars, and if it did not then the project was a waste of time and resources. The plan included four stations, being cut to the present three by the elimination of one under Latrobe Street.

The &#x27;City of Melbourne Underground Railway Construction Act&#x27; was passed in 1960, and test bores were sunk by the Mines Department in 1961, but no funding was provided. Throughout the next few years many proposals were made for providing more car parking in the city, so in 1963 the Government set up the Metropolitan Transportation Committee to look at both road and rail transport. It released a report in 1965 that included the same rail plan as the 1960 Act.

===Construction===
Following the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan, the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Act 1970 was introduced into parliament by Transport Minister Vernon Wilcox, and the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Authority (MURLA) was created on 1 January 1971 to oversee the construction and operation of the loop. The City of Melbourne, the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Board of Works and the Victorian Railways all made annual contributions to support the operating costs of the authority. An unsuccessful request for funding was made to the Federal Government.

The project was financed using debentures, with the State Government paying 60% of the cost and a special city levy from 1963 funding the remainder. The levy was supposed to be in place for forty years (until 2003), but was ended in 1995. A consortium of four engineering companies was established to construct the project: one from Australia, one from the United Kingdom, one from Canada and one from the United States of America. On 22 June 1971, the first sod of the project was turned by Wilcox in the middle of the Jolimont rail yards.

Tunnelling works under the city streets commenced in June 1972, using a tunnel boring machine built by Richmond engineering firm Jaques Limited. as well as conventional boring methods. At North Melbourne, Spencer Street and Jolimont Yard, cut and cover tunnelling was used to build the access ramps, with the above ground running lines being slewed from time to time as work proceeded. The first completed tunnel was the Burnley Loop, with the final breakthrough made on 8 June 1977 near the Museum station site.

The loop comprises four single-track tunnels on two levels, and includes +four pre-existing elevated tracks between Flinders Street and Spencer Street stations. A new double track concrete viaduct was erected beside the existing quadruple track Flinders Street Viaduct in order to replace capacity for non-loop trains. Construction began in 1975 and was completed in 1978. Of the three new stations, Museum was built using the cut and cover method in a box, while Flagstaff and Parliament were excavated using mining methods. During the excavation of Museum station, La Trobe Street and its tram tracks were temporarily relocated to the south onto the site of what is now the Melbourne Central Shopping Centre from December 1973, and were moved back in 1978.

The total length of tunnels in the loop is with of circular tunnels, and of box tunnels. The four tunnels have an average length of , with a further of track connecting with surface tracks. Some of earth was removed and of concrete poured to form the stations and line the tunnel walls.

A &quot;double sleeper&quot; floating track system was used to solve the problem of ground-transmitted vibration and track noise, and the loop has some of the best-designed and quietest underground stations in the world. At the time of its construction, Parliament station had the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s longest escalators.

Traction power was turned on in October 1980, and the first test train ran on 4 December 1980. In 1965, the cost of the project had been estimated at between £30 and £35 million but, by 1975, inflation had resulted in it rising to $255,600,000. While the final cost was $500 million, the opening of the loop helped reverse a 30-year trend of falling suburban rail patronage.

===Opening===
Queen Elizabeth II toured Museum station during her visit to Australia in May 1980, and opened the plaza on top of the Swanston Street entrance, which was named Queen Elizabeth Plaza. Two short documentary films, &quot;Loop&quot; and &quot;Action Loop&quot;, were commissioned by the MURLA to advertise the new railway to Melburnians, as well as abroad. A third film was planned, but never shot.The loop was opened gradually between 1981 and 1985. Museum station and the Burnley and Caulfield tunnels opened first, on 24 January 1981. The City Circle tunnel opened with special services on 6 December 1981, and Clifton Hill services started using the loop on 31 October 1982. Parliament station opened on 22 January 1983, the Northern tunnel on 7 January 1985 (14 January 1985 with limited services) and Flagstaff station on 27 May 1985.

===Recent===
In 2021, seven-car High Capacity Metro Trains were introduced to the City Loop on the Caulfield tunnel. As part of that, signalling infrastructure was altered and operations of the Caulfield loop were changed to run consistently anti-clockwise around the loop all-day, every day.

In January 2023, the City Loop and its three stations were closed for two weeks to allow for major safety upgrades to the stations and tunnels. The works will upgrade smoke detection systems, extraction systems, fire detection, fire hydrants, CCTV, and intruder-detection systems. The upgrade was originally started under the Napthine Liberal government in 2014 and was significantly delayed after the collapse of the contractor while works were underway. The cost ballooned from an estimated $43 million in 2014 to $469 million in 2023.

==Future==
===Metro Tunnel===
Construction began in 2017 on the Metro Tunnel, a new heavy rail tunnel through the Melbourne central business district designed to relieve congestion on the City Loop tunnels. The dual tunnels are set to open by 2025. The north-south tunnels were first recommended by the Eddington Transport Report in 2008 as a way to increase the central city&#x27;s rail capacity. The tunnel involves the construction of five new underground stations at Arden, Parkville, State Library, Town Hall and Anzac. There will be direct underground pedestrian interchanges with City Loop and other metropolitan services at State Library with Melbourne Central station, and at Town Hall with Flinders Street station.

This Metro Tunnel will create a new cross-city rail corridor, upgrading and connecting the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines in Melbourne&#x27;s south-east to the Sunbury line in Melbourne&#x27;s north-west. Once complete the Cranbourne, Pakenham and Sunbury lines will be taken out of the City Loop, allowing for an increase in services on the Craigieburn and Upfield lines. The Frankston line will be returned to the City Loop and have dedicated use in the Caulfield tunnel, while Sandringham line trains will run through to Williamstown and Werribee via the Flinders Street Viaduct.

===Reconfiguration===

The Network Development Plan – Metropolitan Rail in 2012 proposed reconfiguring the City Loop. Once complete, the reconfiguration would help the network to run seven independent lines with dedicated access in the CBD. The proposal was again included in the 30-year Infrastructure Strategy for 2021–2051 from the independent government advisory body Infrastructure Victoria, as recommendation 60.

The project would see up to of new tunnel built, creating new entrances to the existing City Loop tunnels. Two of the four City Loop tunnels would be &#x27;split&#x27; from the loop, and run as an independent pair of underground cross-city tracks from Richmond station to North Melbourne station. This would allow more trains to pass through the city rather than travelling around the City Loop, and would free up a pair of tracks between Flinders Street station and Southern Cross on the Flinders Street Viaduct for a second cross-city route. According to Infrastructure Victoria, the project would deliver two-thirds of the capacity uplift of the Metro Tunnel for a fraction of the cost.

The main purpose of reconfiguring the City Loop is to allow more services to operate across the network using existing infrastructure. Infrastructure Victoria in its 30-year strategy argued the Craigieburn metropolitan line, the Shepparton regional line and the Seymour regional line would reach capacity in the 2030s, and the City Loop would be heavily congested by 2036. After the Metro Tunnel opens, services would still be constrained by the Craigieburn line sharing a single City Loop track with the Upfield line. Reconfiguration would allow both lines to run more services, and allow more frequent services on the Glen Waverley and Frankston lines.

Infrastructure Victoria envisioned Glen Waverley and Alamein services running through to the Upfield line via the Flinders Street Viaduct and Frankston services running through to the Craigieburn line via the reconfigured City Loop track pair, which differs from the post-reconfiguration network outlined in stage 4 of the 2012 Network Development Plan.

The reconfiguration would also allow for suburban extensions of the rail network, including extending the Upfield line to the northern growth suburbs of Donnybrook, Beveridge and Wallan. Infrastructure Victoria recommended the state government complete a business case into the project.

==Layout==
The City Loop consists of four independent single-track tunnels, and services operate as four balloon loops, two of which operate one way during the morning and the other way in the afternoon. The City Loop has four tracks on two levels and all stations have four platforms. The four tunnels have portals on both the eastern and western ends of the city centre. The Burnley and Caulfield tunnels run mostly parallel to each other, beginning at Richmond and ending at Southern Cross. The Clifton Hill tunnel&#x27;s Western End begins at Southern Cross; the tunnel is the only one that can serve as a full loop, as the tunnel splits into two after Parliament branching off to both Jolimont and Flinders Street.

==Services and direction of travel==
All metropolitan lines on the Melbourne rail network except for the Stony Point line serve Flinders Street station, but not all of these lines serve the City Loop. Trains on the Frankston line operate to Werribee and Williamstown via Flinders Street while Sandringham services operate directly to Flinders Street in both directions.

The eleven remaining metropolitan lines serve the City Loop and are organised into four separate groups: Burnley, Caulfield, Clifton Hill, and Northern. Each group has its own dedicated single track tunnel, and carries several lines. The Alamein, Belgrave, Craigieburn, Cranbourne, Glen Waverley, Hurstbridge, Lilydale, Mernda, Pakenham, Sunbury, and Upfield lines all run through the loop, although some services run direct to Flinders Street station.

Stopping patterns alternate during weekdays on the Northern and Burnley Groups, with trains switching directions during the day, whereas on the Clifton Hill and Caulfield groups stopping patterns remain consistent all day.

===Burnley group===
The Burnley group consists of the Belgrave, Lilydale, Alamein, and Glen Waverley railway lines. The line is one of two that change operations in the middle of the day. Trains operate anti-clockwise through the loop during weekday mornings and clockwise during weekday afternoons and weekends. Citybound trains from Glen Waverley will not travel via the City Loop on weekday mornings and will instead travel direct to Flinders Street. During the afternoon peak Alamein and Blackburn services run direct to and from Flinders Street, while on weekends all Alamein services terminate at Camberwell and thus do not travel via the City Loop.

Prior to 2011, Glen Waverley trains operated via the City Loop during morning peak, while Alamein and Blackburn services operated direct to Flinders Street.

===Caulfield group===
The Caulfield group consists of the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines. The line operates anti-clockwise through the City Loop all day, entering the Loop at Parliament and leaving at Flinders Street.

Major changes were made to the Northern and Caulfield group tunnels in 2021. Previously, the Frankston and Sandringham lines also operated via the Caulfield tunnel. Services also operated clockwise during weekday afternoons while running anti-clockwise during weekday mornings and weekends.

When the Metro Tunnel opens in 2025, Pakenham and Cranbourne services will be pulled out of the loop and instead will operate to Sunbury. Frankston services will return to the loop in the Caulfield group tunnel.

===Clifton Hill group===
The Clifton Hill group consists of the Hurstbridge and Mernda lines. The line was the first to operate in a consistent direction all day. All services on the group operate in a clockwise direction all day, entering the city at Flinders Street and leaving after Parliament.

Prior to 2008, services operated anti-clockwise during weekday mornings similar to the Burnley Group. From 2008 to 2013 services ran clockwise on weekdays and anti-clockwise on weekends. The main reason for the current operational direction is because of the flat junction at Jolimont, which prevents inbound trains from running anti-clockwise without crossing the outbound tracks. 

The Clifton Hill tunnel is the only tunnel able to operate as a full loop as the tunnel breaks off towards both Jolimont and Flinders Street after Parliament. Previously this tunnel was used to operate the full time City Circle train line that ran on a permanent loop around the CBD, however in 1993 this service was replaced by the surface-level City Circle tram. The tunnel is still used partially as an alternative form of transport in cases where some lines are temporarily shut down.

===Northern group===
The Northern group consists of the Craigieburn, Sunbury, and Upfield lines. Services operate clockwise on weekday mornings and weekends and operate anti-clockwise during weekday afternoons and evenings.

On 31 January 2021, there were major changes to the Northern and Caulfield group tunnels. Prior to this, Werribee services also operated through the loop during weekends, but the line was rerouted to operate to Frankston to increase service reliability on both the Cross-City and Northern groups.

In 2025, Sunbury services will cease operation in the City Loop and will instead connect with the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines via the new Metro Tunnel, allowing greater service frequency on the Craigieburn and Upfield lines.

===Summary table===
==Stations==

The City Loop has three underground railway stations at Parliament, Melbourne Central, and Flagstaff. The stations were opened in the 1980s, with Melbourne Central being the oldest, opening in 1981, and Flagstaff the last to open in 1985. Each railway station features four tracks with two island platforms stacked on top of each other.

===Parliament===
Parliament station opened in 1983 and serves the eastern end of the CBD. The station has entrances on Lonsdale Street and on Macarthur Street. The station gets its name from its proximity to the Parliament of Victoria. The station has interchanges with three tram routes on Nicholson Street and two tram routes on Macarthur Street.

===Melbourne Central===
Melbourne Central opened in 1981 as Museum Station. The station received its original name from the Melbourne Museum, which was located within the State Library of Victoria. The station&#x27;s name was changed in 1997 to Melbourne Central following the 1991 redevelopment of the site above the station to Melbourne Central Shopping Centre and the relocation of the Melbourne Museum to a new building in Carlton Gardens. 

Melbourne Central station is unique as it has only one direct street-facing entrance to the station on Elizabeth Street, with a second entrance located inside of the shopping centre. The station interchanges with 15 bus routes on Lonsdale Street, three tram routes on Elizabeth street, eight tram routes on Swanston Street and two tram routes on La Trobe Street.

===Flagstaff===

Flagstaff station opened in 1985 and serves the Western end of the CBD. The station owes its name because of its proximity to Flagstaff Gardens, which is just north of the station. The station features two entrances on the William/La Trobe street intersection. The station interchanges with two tram routes on Latrobe Street and two tram routes on William Street

<text>Ibrahim al-Hamdi (30 September 1943 – 11 October 1977) () was a Yemeni military officer who served as the third President of the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) from 13 June 1974 until his assassination on 11 October 1977. During his rule, he cemented the central government&#x27;s control over the country, and planned to end tribal loyalty and Yemen&#x27;s medieval social classes by proclaiming all Yemenis as equal.

== Early life and career==

Ibrahim al-Hamdi was born in Qattab, Ibb in southwestern Yemen. His family was from the Banu Hamdan tribe.

In his early adulthood he was an associate for his father, who worked as a judge. His father taught him about Islamic law while he was studying in the Aviation College to become a pilot, but did not complete his studies and continued working with his father as a judge in the court of Dhamar during the reign of Imam Ahmed Yahya Hamid al-Din where he raised much controversy and attention.

Then, he became in the era of President Abdullah as-Sallal the commander of the commandos. Then the responsibility for the western, eastern, and central provinces to him in 1972. He was promoted to become the Deputy Prime Minister for Internal Affairs, and then appointed the higher representative Commander of the Armed Forces. On 13 June 1974, he was an effective member of the officers who ran the white military coup overthrowing Abdul Rahman al-Iryani in the revolutionary correction movement of 13 June 1974 and handed over all the president&#x27;s and the members&#x27; of the republican council authorities to the military forces which represented in the leadership of the general and senior officers mentioned: Ahmad Ghashmi, Yahya Mutawakil, Mujahid Abu Shawareb, Ali Al-Shibh, Hammoud Pedder, Ali Alilla&#x27;a, AED Abu Meat, Ali Abu Lohoum, and added later Abdaziz Abdul Ghani and Abdullah Abdulalim.

==Economic achievements==

Colonel Ibrahim al-Hamdi led the thirteenth corrective movement. Hamdi aimed to correct the Yemeni revolutionary path, to get rid of a &quot;legacy of decadence.&quot; He primarily sought to calm tribal feuds and regional conflicts, which had been prevalent under previous rulers. Thus, security was his top concern. He also promoted financial reforms to put an end to favoritism and bribery. He created committees to implement these reforms, saving estimated tens of millions of Riyals.

Furthermore, he initiated a large infrastructure plan, paving thousands of kilometres of dirt roads, building thousands of schools, and hundreds of clinics and health centres. He encouraged people and many non-local investors to invest in the sections of agriculture and local manufacturing. This period saw rising standards of living and much prosperity.

When al-Hamdi came to power in 1974, North Yemen lacked the most basic services and infrastructure. He created a five-year development plan supervised by a number of committees, which encouraged local communities to contribute “to road construction, school building, and water networks.”
In an unprecedented move, al-Hamdi allocated 31 percent of North Yemen’s annual budget to education. Believing that education was the cornerstone to development and progress, al-Hamdi implemented a free breakfast program for pupils in remote rural areas to increase access to basic schooling.
Moreover, Al-Hamdi made a number of executive decisions during his rule to increase the role of government and promote citizenship and equality. His efforts to eradicate tribal loyalty (including in the military) and establish the rule of law in a country devastated by years of civil conflict were ground-breaking in the Arab world during the 1970s.
Al-Hamdi abolished the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (a body he believed was an obstacle to the country’s economic and social advancement) and established the Ministry of Local Administration. He also restructured the North Yemen army and raised the salaries of military and civilian personnel.

During al-Hamdi’s rule, North Yemen witnessed remarkable economic growth, with the country’s GDP rising from 21.5 percent in 1974 to 56.1 percent in 1977. Its per capita income rose by 300 percent in the same period. Al-Hamdi was also planning to establish more democratic institutions in the country by founding what he called “popular conventions.” The purpose of these conventions was to “prepare the groundwork for eventual elections” in North Yemen.

However, the tribal forces that allegedly conspired with Saudi Arabia against al-Hamdi did not allow his plans for North Yemen to come to fruition. On October 11, 1977, he was assassinated, along with his brother, in his vice president’s house in Sana’a.

This man had started his path to the presidency with arduous efforts, and was assisted by a group of young faces qualified academically to build a modern government based on law, order, and institutions. It was a difficult task, but not impossible for a commander who collected in his persona the power and the model, plus his culture and excellence through his civilian and military experiences, and what was more important is the honor that observed from his family when he worked as a judge (during his short experience in the judiciary while the absence of his father Judge Mohammed Saleh Al-Hamdi all provisions was ending to between the rivals) so he learned two rules: that justice is the base of governance, and the base of governance is the fear of Allah. Thus he proved his worth as a national leader through several works in addition to justice, including:
* Laying a long-term economic plan to develop the country.
* Paying all the government debt and started to loan the World Bank.
* Helping reduce the power of tribes and Saudi backed sheikhs and strengthening the rule of law.
* Putting down all military ranks, which amounted to inflation and their holders to satisfy providers including his rank to attributed the soldier&#x27;s and officers lost prestige.
* Preventing the use of government vehicles and military or public institutions cars for personal purposes.
* Increasing the salary along with four additional salaries in some occasions like Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, the anniversary of the revolution and the anniversary of the thirteen of June Movement.

Under Al-Hamdi&#x27;s administration, Yemen enjoyed the most prosperous economic boom since 1962, as he was responsible for a civil engineering endeavour that would usher in an era of unprecedented economic growth in Yemen&#x27;s post-Imamate history. More specifically, Hamdi fostered the creation of &#x27;Local Development Associations,&#x27; which functioned as autonomous community-based institutions focused on developing local infrastructure. Scholar Isa Blumi notes that while &quot;Able to exclusively access the potential tax revenue under their jurisdictions, the committees created from members of the community could also solicit external funds and loans (almost exclusively drawn from local, non-banking sources) independently of the central state and bank now formally connected to the outside world.&quot; In other words, during the 1970s the LDAs did the heavy lifting as far as the development of Yemen&#x27;s infrastructure was concerned. What is more, the locally driven LDAs protected the Yemeni countryside from an influx of foreign finance capital (disguised as development &#x27;aid&#x27; and often tethered to massive usury rates). The LDA system thus preserved Yemen&#x27;s economic sovereignty until 1978.

== Military ==
During his rule, Al Hamdi built up the Yemeni defenses in Bab al Mandab and on Yemeni islands and modernized and expanded the Yemeni Navy. He reorganised the Yemeni army into four main forces:

*The Giants forces: These forces were formed from merging the Giants brigade with regular units, as a military strike force in Dhamar governorate. Its commander was Abdullah Al Hamdi, the president&#x27;s brother
*General Reserve Forces: It was formed when the Storm brigade and the Reserve brigade were merged.
*Parachute forces: Formed from the Thunderbolt corps, the Parachute corps and the Commando brigade.
*Military Police Forces: Formed from the Military Police Corps and the Security Command.

==Assassination==

The circumstances of al-Hamdi&#x27;s death remain undetermined, although the perpetrator is widely assumed to be a Saudi agent. Those believed to have conspired against the life of the President were the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Lt. Col. Ahmad al-Ghashmi, and the head of Yemen’s Security Department, Mohammad al-Khamis, as well as Ali Abdullah Saleh, himself, who then served as commander of the Taiz Military Brigade, all of whom were present at the home of al-Ghashmi where al-Hamdi had been invited for lunch when he was assassinated. His assassination came two days before his scheduled visit to the South of Yemen to negotiate the unification of the North and South of Yemen at that time. His death cleared the ground for Ali Abdullah Saleh, who sought the immediate reversal of Hamdi&#x27;s local development agenda.

When the Yemeni Revolution broke out, protesters gathered with the image of the late president, demanding justice and the investigation of the death of al-Hamdi.

<doc id="468933" wikidata="Q1276913" url="?curid=468933" title="Novatianism">
<text>Novatianism or Novationism was an early Christian sect devoted to the theologian Novatian ( 200–258) that held a strict view that refused readmission to communion of &quot;lapsi&quot; (those baptized Christians who had denied their faith or performed the formalities of a ritual sacrifice to the pagan gods under the pressures of the persecution sanctioned by Emperor Decius in AD 250). The Church of Rome declared the Novatianists heretical following the letters of Saint Cyprian of Carthage and Ambrose wrote against them. Novatianism survived until the 8th century.

Novatian theology was heavily influenced by Tertullian, and made heavy use of his writings.

==Novatian==
After the martyrdom of Pope Fabian during the Decian persecution, a Roman priest, Novatian, opposed the election of Pope Cornelius in 251, on the grounds that Cornelius was too liberal in accepting lapsed Christians. Novatian held that lapsed Christians, who had not maintained their confession of faith under persecution, may not be received again into communion with the church. He was consecrated bishop by three bishops of Italy and declared himself to be the true Pope. He and his followers were excommunicated by a synod held at Rome in October of the same year. Novatian is said to have suffered martyrdom under Emperor Valerian I (253–260).

Novatian should not be confused with one Novatus, a priest of Carthage, who advocated re-admitting the &quot;lapsi&quot; without an enforced penance. Cyprian of Carthage came to a position opposed to both and advocated a council be held to establish a policy under which former idolaters could be once again admitted to communion with the church.

Lardner argues that Eusebius and the Greeks in general were correct in calling the Roman presbyter Novatus, not Novatianus. He attributes the origin of the latter name to Cyprian, who called the Roman presbyter Novatianus, as being a follower of his own rebellious priest, Novatus of Carthage. Novatian in his writings defended the doctrine of the Trinity, argued that the Old Testament prohibitions on meats must be understood spiritually, condemned Christians who attend public games and praised chastity. Novatian was heavily influenced by the works of Tertullian.

== Beliefs ==

=== &quot;Lapsi&quot; ===
Novatian believed that the &quot;lapsi&quot; should not be let back into the church. He believed that the &quot;lapsi&quot; might repent and be put to lifelong penance, but the forgiveness must be left to God, and that the &quot;lapsi&quot; could not be forgiven on this earth.

Novatians cited the Book of Hebrews to support this idea.

=== God ===
Novatian was a trinitarian. Novatian&#x27;s writings defended the Father as the creator of the world to combat the teachings of the Gnostics. Novatian also defended the unity of the godhead and humanity in Jesus, and wrote about a distinction between the Son and the Father, to combat Marcionites, Modalists and Adoptionists. Novatian believed that the role of the Holy Spirit was solely to be the source of blessings given during Baptism.

=== The Church ===
Unlike Cyprian, Novatian believed that being inside the church is not a requirement for salvation, but that the church is a congregation of saints, and if sinners would be let inside the church, it would endanger the church. Novatians always had a successor of Novatian in Rome (where Novatian was from) and they used the episcopal polity.

=== Other ===
According to Theodoret, the Novatians did not use confirmation, and according to Eulugius, Novatians did not either venerate martyrs. Novatians forbade remarriage. Christologically Novatian was probably orthodox, however some suggest he had similarities to the later Nestorians, though this view has been criticized.

By the 4th century, Novatians had also adopted monasticism.

Some Novatians were Quartodecimans.

=== Baptism ===
Augustine writes that the Novatians would rebaptize people who came from the Catholic Church. Some have argued that the Novatians did not baptize infants, though the stance of the Novatians is disputed and the arguments that Novatians were credobaptist is founded on somewhat weak evidence, and by this point infant baptism had become common and clear among the orthodox writers.

==After Novatian==
Novatian&#x27;s strict views existed before him and may be found in &quot;The Shepherd of Hermas&quot;. After his death, the Novatianist sect spread rapidly and could be found in every province and were very numerous in some places. Those who allied themselves with his doctrines were called &quot;Novatianists&quot;, but they called themselves () or &quot;Purists&quot; (not to be confused with the later Cathars) to reflect their desire not to be identified with what they considered the lax practices of a corrupted and what was hitherto a universal Church.

While Novatian had refused absolution to the &quot;lapsi&quot; (those who had renounced their Christianity under persecution but later wanted to return to the church), his followers extended the doctrine to include all mortal sins (idolatry, murder, and adultery, or fornication). Most of them forbade second marriage. They always had a successor of Novatian at Rome and were everywhere governed by bishops.

Because Novatianists (including Novatian) did not submit to the bishop of Rome, they were labeled by Rome as schismatics. Additionally, Rome also labeled Novatianists heretics for denying that the Church had the power to grant absolution in certain cases (such as to the &quot;lapsi&quot;).

In the 4th and 5th centuries, the Donatist sect in Africa Proconsulare maintained a similar belief about Christians who had lapsed under the pressures of persecution; they too were declared heretics.

Some Novatians blended with the Montanists.

<doc id="468935" wikidata="Q7873441" url="?curid=468935" title="USS Richard E. Byrd (DDG-23)">
<text>USS &quot;Richard E. Byrd&quot; (DDG-23), was a guided missile destroyer of the United States Navy, named after noted polar explorer Admiral Richard E. Byrd.

The keel for &quot;Richard E. Byrd&quot; was laid on 12 April 1961 by Todd Shipbuilding Corp. Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 6 February 1962; sponsored by Mrs. Richard E. Byrd, whose daughter, Mrs. Robert G. Breyer, acted as proxy sponsor for the admiral&#x27;s wife. The ship was commissioned on 7 March 1964. Decommissioned on 27 April 1990, the ship sold to Greece and used for spare parts in 1992 and sunk as a target on 19 June 2003.

==Service==

Following a 45-day fitting out period at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, &quot;Richard E. Byrd&quot; steamed for her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, via the Panama Canal, arriving 14 June 1964. &quot;Richard E. Byrd&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean 6 January 1965 as a unit of Destroyer Division 182.

Late January 1967 &quot;Richard E. Byrd&quot; moved south to the Jacksonville, Florida operations area, and, while serving as rescue destroyer for the aircraft carrier , she rescued Lt. (jg) John F. Dickinson, whose A-4E aircraft crashed during a landing approach. In May &quot;Richard E. Byrd&quot; was at sea as part of the screen of the carrier , which force rendezvoused with the damaged on 9 June.

On 6 October 1969 ship and crew participated together with Senator Harry F. Byrd and Virginia Gov. Mills E. Godwin, in the dedication of Richard Evelyn Byrd Hall at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science at Gloucester Point, Virginia.

On 26 January 1975, an advance party landing party of two ship officers were mobbed by an angry demonstration of 4,000 Greeks on the island of Corfu. After being stoned, attempts were made to set their car on fire and lynch the occupants. One Greek was killed in the incident, but police and fire trucks successfully escorted the two back to their ship off shore. Over the next hours the protest demonstration regarding the Cypriot War swelled to 10,000, and &quot;Richard E. Byrd&quot; ended her port visit.

Early 1985, the start of a six-month North Atlantic cruise involved a port visit to Lisbon, Portugal. At the end of the visit on 28 January about 3 a.m. local GMT, five other NATO ships and &quot;Richard E. Byrd&quot; at Alcantara dock came under mortar fire from the terrorist group Forças Populares 25 de Abril without damage.

==Decommissioning==
The guided missile destroyer continued to serve until decommissioned on 27 April 1990. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 October 1992 and officially transferred to the Hellenic Navy on 26 August 1993. The hulk was towed to Salamis, Greece, on 12 October 1993 where she was used for spare parts for the other four &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; destroyers in Greek service.

<doc id="468936" wikidata="Q6823372" url="?curid=468936" title="Metcard">
<text>Metcard was the brand name of an integrated ticketing system used to access public transport in Melbourne, Australia. It was a universal ticket which allowed users to ride on the city&#x27;s Metlink and Metropolitan Transit Authority network, consisting of suburban trains, trams, and buses, including the NightRider network. The Metcard was a credit card-sized ticket made out of cardboard and used a magnetic strip to store fare data. Metcard was operated by OneLink Transit Systems under a contract with the Government of Victoria which was managed by the Transport Ticketing Authority.

==History==
In July 1983, the Metropolitan Transit Authority was formed to integrate Melbourne&#x27;s tram, train and bus services. The Metropolitan Transit Authority also integrated bus, train and tram ticketing using punch card and scratch card tickets. Under the arrangements, the Government of Victoria collected all revenue from the sale of multi-modal tickets, which was then allocated to the various operators on the basis of an agreed formula.

Moves towards automated ticketing were first made in 1992. Tenders were called for the design, supply, installation and on-going maintenance of the system, with the OneLink Transit Consortium becoming the preferred tenderer in September 1993. The contract was signed in May 1994, with the major technology supplier being the ERG Group (now Vix Technology).

Testing of prototypes commenced in December 1993, and the roll-out of the system was carried out from August 1996 to April 1998. Public field trials were carried out on buses from 20 August 1996, and on rail services from 18 September 1996. Acceptance occurred in November 1997. The system commenced full revenue service from May 1998 at a cost of $330 million. Contractual issues between OneLink and the Victorian Government were not settled until May 2002 with the payment of up to $65 million in a staged settlement.

In 2002, Metcard replaced the functionally identical yet technically simpler punch tickets and scratchie tickets, which were easy to cheat.
In 2009, the rollout of a new smartcard ticketing system, Myki, would signal the end of the Metcard. The Metcard system was deactivated on 29 December 2012.

==Controversy==
Controversy surrounded Metcard at its introduction, due to cost over-runs, the abolition of tram conductors and the unreliability of ticket purchasing and validation machines. The ticket vending machines were frequently attacked by vandals (often by pouring liquids into the coin slot), and underwent several revisions to their design.

An audit released by the Victorian Government in 2001 showed over 1 in 4 (27.2%) of machines at railway stations did not work, and 11.9% of mobile equipment in buses and trams were non-operational. The State Government renegotiated with ticketing network contract operator OneLink Transit Systems to improve the service to commuters. Following these improvements, a 2002 audit showed an increase in availability of machines to 92.1% at railway stations, and 98.3% on buses and trams. Usability was also improved, with tram machines able to sell daily tickets. Furthermore, vandalism across the network dropped by 62% between 2001 and 2002.

V/Line tickets were aligned with the Metcard system in April 2006, with each V/Line ticket to stations in the Metcard area having the relevant zones printed on them. In March 2007 the Nightrider bus service was also brought under the Metcard system. and zone 3 of the system was abolished, being merged with zone 2.

The original Metcard contract with OneLink was to last nine years, expiring in March 2007. In 2005 the contract was amended to permit the system to be extended and modified as work on the replacement Myki project progressed, with the contract being able to be terminated on six months notice.

==Operation==


All forms of public transport could be accessed by using a single Metcard. Metcards were a time and zone based ticket, with validity periods ranging from 2 hours to yearly, and two zones covering the Melbourne metropolitan area.

When the system was in full operation, Metcards could be purchased from:
* Ticket Vending Machines at rail stations

Ticket availability varied, with the sources above each stocking slightly different ranges beyond the standard two-hour, daily and seniors tickets. Availability on board buses was particularly restricted, with neither the Sunday Saver nor off-peak tickets being available from drivers. Similarly, ticket vending machines at railway stations did not stock Sunday Savers or some types of off-peak tickets. Payment options varied from coin-only (small Metcard machines on trams and at railway stations), EFTPOS, coin and some notes (large ticket machines at stations) to EFTPOS, credit card, coin and all notes (premium railway stations).

In March 2008, the new route 401 bus service from North Melbourne railway station to the Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne became the first and only bus route in Melbourne that required the purchase of a Metcard before travel.

Metcards were &#x27;validated&#x27; when entering or exiting railway stations, and getting on trams or buses. The first validation printed an expiry date and time on the back of the ticket. Subsequent validations of most types of tickets did not print extra times but the data was intended to be used to count passenger numbers (in order to improve transport services). Revalidation of already validated tickets, whilst functionally unnecessary, was and is still required by law and occasional campaigns continue to remind passengers of this.

When transport operations were franchised, revalidation data was also used to apportion revenue share between operators. This has since been abandoned in favour of fixed percentage allocations (40% train, 40% tram and 20% bus).

With most railway stations not having ticket-operated barriers and trams not having conductors, enforcement was and is still the responsibility of roaming Authorised Officers (ticket inspectors). Authorised Officers (AOs) check that passengers have the correct ticket and, if using a concession ticket, have a suitable concession card. AOs did not issue fines directly but issued an infringement notice. The passenger then received a letter from the Department of Transport, who could issue a fine. Passengers could either pay the fine, seek an internal review, or contest it in court.

==Zones and fares==

Metcard tickets function within a zonal system. Melbourne is divided into two zones: Zone 1 (Yellow) and Zone 2 (Blue). Until early 2007, there was also a Zone 3 (Red), but this was abolished by extending Zone 2 to all areas covered by Zone 3. The two zones form concentric rings, with Zone 1 comprising the inner suburbs, and Zone 2 covering the remainder of metropolitan Melbourne. Zone 3 covered the outer eastern, southern and south-eastern metropolitan area, but this area is now part of Zone 2. Zone overlap areas exist on the borders of the zones. In these areas tickets for either zone are acceptable. The fare payable depends on the zone or zones in which the passenger travels, with higher fares for trips that include both travel zones

A separate fare and ticketing system exists for V/Line (country) services. However, since April 2006 holders of V/Line tickets to Melbourne have had access to both Zone 1 and 2 without needing to purchase another ticket. V/Line tickets to Zone 2 stations are valid for Zone 2 only. Fares in most towns just outside Melbourne were also aligned to Zone 2 Metcard prices as part of this integration.

A range of tickets was available, including two-hour, all-day, weekly, monthly and annual tickets. There were also concession tickets for students, seniors and others. In 2010, a daily Zone 1 and 2 full-fare (as distinct from concession fare) ticket cost A$2.70, and a weekly Zone 1 and 2 ticket cost A$10.40. Prices generally rise by inflation (CPI) on 1 January each year, though there have been occasional higher than CPI increases.

==Transition to Myki==

The Metcard system was originally scheduled to be replaced in 2008 by a contactless smart card ticketing system, called myki, which would cover all public transport in the state. 
However, in February 2008, Victorian Public Transport Minister Lynne Kosky announced that the full roll out of the system would not begin until the end of 2008. Approximately 7 weeks later, the system was delayed for approximately another 2 years, with an announcement that the service was now scheduled to begin its roll out in 2009, but not be fully operational until some time in 2010. The system was finally introduced on 29 December 2009, but only for metropolitan train services, and was introduced on bus and tram services on 25 July 2010.
The two systems would coexist until the transition was complete. Metcard equipment was able to support a similar system based on re-usable RFID touch cards for use by public transport staff and other pass holders, however this provided neither the flexibility nor advantages intended to be available under by the myki system.

The new system was announced as a touch on / touch off system, where two validations are required per journey; one when boarding and again when alighting, similar to the London Underground&#x27;s Oyster card system. This means passengers would have a single card and be charged for the actual fare used (flat rate fare). This is unlike Metcard where passengers who travel into different zones at different days and times may need to buy several types of Metcards beforehand.

Touch on / touch off has both benefits and costs. On the one hand, it allows fares to be automatically calculated, always giving the passenger the cheapest fare option and special off-peak fares to encourage travel during quiet times could be implemented, which is impossible with Metcard. The main disadvantage would be to passengers who do not touch off and who would therefore be charged the total fare for the trip they might have taken.

Following the change of government in November 2010, an enquiry was held into the future of myki, with various options considered including whether to proceed with it, modify its introduction, or scrap it altogether and retain Metcard. In June 2011, the Victorian Government confirmed that the roll-out of myki would continue and that Metcards would no longer be available after December 2012.

==Withdrawal==

The withdrawal of the Metcard system commenced on 2 January 2012 with the end of online and over-the-phone sales of Metcards, and the removal of yearly Metcards from sale. Other points of sale and Metcard types were progressively removed as Myki sales were introduced Melbourne-wide. Metcard validators at railway stations were also progressively removed, while the process of replacing Metcard gates with Myki gates began.

By November 2012, only short-term Metcards (one day or less) could be purchased, and only on board trams and buses. Unused and partially used Metcards could still be used.

All remaining Metcards were withdrawn from sale at 3:00 am on 29 December 2012. From this date, remaining Metcard equipment was closed for use. Unused and partially used Metcards were no longer valid tickets.

During early 2013, the remaining Metcard gates at railway stations were replaced with Myki gates, while all other remaining Metcard equipment was progressively removed.

Below are some of the milestones of the withdrawal of Metcard:

* On 2 January 2012, the withdrawal of Metcard began, with the ending of online and over-the-phone sales of Metcards, and the withdrawal of yearly Metcards from sale.
* From January to March 2012, Myki sales from vending machines were rolled out across Melbourne metropolitan railway stations, major tram stops and bus interchanges.
* From late January to late July 2012, Metcard machines were shut down and removed from Melbourne metropolitan railway stations, commencing with Flagstaff Station in the week of 30 January - 3 February and culminating with the last Metcard vending machine being removed from Southern Cross station during the week of 23–27 July. Metcard vending machines at other locations were also withdrawn during this time period.
* From February to April 2012, Metcards were progressively withdrawn from sale at retail outlets as Myki sales were progressively introduced.
* Weekly and monthly Metcards were withdrawn from sale on 26 March 2012, followed by &quot;value&quot; Metcards (all multi-period, Sunday Saver and off-peak daily Metcards) on 2 July.
* From late August 2012, Metcard sales at premium station ticket offices were progressively replaced by Myki sales or top ups, starting at Williamstown Station in the week of 27 August, and ending at Flagstaff station on 12 October.
* Starting at Flagstaff station on 12 October 2012, Metcard/Myki hybrid barriers at railway stations were progressively replaced with Myki-only barriers. This process is scheduled to continue through until March 2013.
* On 1 November 2012, the PTV Hub (Met Shop) in Swanston Street had ceased its Metcard sales which were replaced by Myki Devices.
* On 12 November 2012, the TTA announced that the progressive removal of Metcard validators at railway stations had commenced on a station-by-station basis. All railway station validators were removed by mid-December.
* Friday, 28 December 2012, was the final day of Metcard sales on trams and buses, as well as all other Metcard use. After this date, Metcard ticket vending machines on trams have been de-activated, meaning that passengers needed to have a Myki before boarding, or risk a fine.
* Starting from 29 December 2012, Metcard equipment including validators on buses and trams were de-activated after its switch off, meaning Melbourne bus passengers have to purchase a Myki before boarding.
* Starting from 1 February 2013, Metcard equipment including validators on buses were removed and the new Myki only top-ups and in mid February 2013, Metcard ticket machines and validators on trams were removed and replaced by the full Myki transition.
* On 30 June 2013, PTV ceased its Metcard refund and transfer to Myki service, which had allowed people with unused or partly used Metcards to transfer their remaining value to a new or existing Myki card.

<doc id="468937" wikidata="Q4446020" url="?curid=468937" title="Exponential sum">
<text>In mathematics, an exponential sum may be a finite Fourier series (i.e. a trigonometric polynomial), or other finite sum formed using the exponential function, usually expressed by means of the function

:formula_1

Therefore, a typical exponential sum may take the form

:formula_2

summed over a finite sequence of real numbers &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

==Formulation==

If we allow some real coefficients &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;, to get the form

:formula_3

it is the same as allowing exponents that are complex numbers. Both forms are certainly useful in applications. A large part of twentieth century analytic number theory was devoted to finding good estimates for these sums, a trend started by basic work of Hermann Weyl in diophantine approximation.

==Estimates==

The main thrust of the subject is that a sum

:formula_4

is &quot;trivially&quot; estimated by the number &quot;N&quot; of terms. That is, the absolute value

:formula_5

by the triangle inequality, since each summand has absolute value 1. In applications one would like to do better. That involves proving some cancellation takes place, or in other words that this sum of complex numbers on the unit circle is not of numbers all with the same argument. The best that is reasonable to hope for is an estimate of the form

:formula_6

which signifies, up to the implied constant in the big O notation, that the sum resembles a random walk in two dimensions.

Such an estimate can be considered ideal; it is unattainable in many of the major problems, and estimates

:formula_7

have to be used, where the o(&quot;N&quot;) function represents only a &quot;small saving&quot; on the trivial estimate. A typical &#x27;small saving&#x27; may be a factor of log(&quot;N&quot;), for example. Even such a minor-seeming result in the right direction has to be referred all the way back to the structure of the initial sequence &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;, to show a degree of randomness. The techniques involved are ingenious and subtle.

A variant of &#x27;Weyl differencing&#x27; investigated by Weyl involving a generating exponential sum

formula_8

was previously studied by Weyl himself, he developed a method to express the sum as the value formula_9, where &#x27;G&#x27; can be defined via a linear differential equation similar to Dyson equation obtained via summation by parts.

==History==

If the sum is of the form

:formula_10

where &quot;ƒ&quot; is a smooth function, we could use the Euler–Maclaurin formula to convert the series into an integral, plus some corrections involving derivatives of &quot;S&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), then for large values of &quot;a&quot; you could use &quot;stationary phase&quot; method to calculate the integral and give an approximate evaluation of the sum. Major advances in the subject were &quot;Van der Corput&#x27;s method&quot; (c. 1920), related to the principle of stationary phase, and the later &quot;Vinogradov method&quot; (c.1930).

The large sieve method (c.1960), the work of many researchers, is a relatively transparent general principle; but no one method has general application.

==Types of exponential sum==

Many types of sums are used in formulating particular problems; applications require usually a reduction to some known type, often by ingenious manipulations. Partial summation can be used to remove coefficients &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;, in many cases.

A basic distinction is between a complete exponential sum, which is typically a sum over all residue classes &quot;modulo&quot; some integer &quot;N&quot; (or more general finite ring), and an incomplete exponential sum where the range of summation is restricted by some inequality. Examples of complete exponential sums are Gauss sums and Kloosterman sums; these are in some sense finite field or finite ring analogues of the gamma function and some sort of Bessel function, respectively, and have many &#x27;structural&#x27; properties. An example of an incomplete sum is the partial sum of the quadratic Gauss sum (indeed, the case investigated by Gauss). Here there are good estimates for sums over shorter ranges than the whole set of residue classes, because, in geometric terms, the partial sums approximate a Cornu spiral; this implies massive cancellation.

Auxiliary types of sums occur in the theory, for example character sums; going back to Harold Davenport&#x27;s thesis. The Weil conjectures had major applications to complete sums with domain restricted by polynomial conditions (i.e., along an algebraic variety over a finite field).

==Weyl sums==
One of the most general types of exponential sum is the Weyl sum, with exponents 2π&quot;if&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) where &quot;f&quot; is a fairly general real-valued smooth function. These are the sums involved in the distribution of the values

:&quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) modulo 1,

according to Weyl&#x27;s equidistribution criterion. A basic advance was Weyl&#x27;s inequality for such sums, for polynomial &quot;f&quot;.

There is a general theory of exponent pairs, which formulates estimates. An important case is where &quot;f&quot; is logarithmic, in relation with the Riemann zeta function. See also equidistribution theorem.

==Example: the quadratic Gauss sum==

Let &quot;p&quot; be an odd prime and let formula_11. Then
the Quadratic Gauss sum is given by

:formula_12

where the square roots are taken to be positive.

This is the ideal degree of cancellation one could hope for without any &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge of the structure of the sum, since it matches the scaling of a random walk.

== Statistical model ==
The &quot;sum of exponentials&quot; is a useful model in pharmacokinetics (chemical kinetics in general) for describing the concentration of a substance over time. The exponential terms correspond to first-order reactions, which in pharmacology corresponds to the number of modelled diffusion &quot;compartments&quot;.

<doc id="468938" wikidata="Q7527596" url="?curid=468938" title="Sir John Beaumont, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir John Beaumont, 1st Baronet (c.1582/3 – April 1627) of Grace Dieu in the parish of Belton in Leicestershire, England, was a poet best known for his work &quot;Bosworth Field&quot; (a poem about the Battle of Bosworth Field).

==Origins==
He was born at Grace Dieu, near Thringstone in Leicestershire, the second son of the judge Sir Francis Beaumont (d.1598) by his wife Anne Pierrepont. His younger brother was the dramatist Francis Beaumont.

==Career==
John matriculated at Broadgates Hall (later Pembroke College) in the University of Oxford on 4 February 1596/1597, entered as a gentleman commoner. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1598 or 1600. The death in 1605 of his elder brother, Sir Henry Beaumont, made John the head of the Beaumont family, and he is thought to have returned to Grace-Dieu to manage the family estates. He was a Roman Catholic and together with his wife was fined for recusancy in 1607, and in 1625 was again in trouble on that account.

He began to write verse early and in 1602, at the age of nineteen, he published anonymously his &quot;Metamorphosis of Tabacco&quot;, written in very smooth couplets, in which he addressed Michael Drayton as his loving friend. After long retirement Beaumont was persuaded by the Duke of Buckingham to return to society. He attended court and on 31 January 1626/1627 was created by the king a Baronet &quot;of Gracedieu, in Belton, County Leicester&quot;, in the Baronetage of England.

==Marriage and children==
Beaumont lived in Leicestershire for many years as a bachelor, before eventually marrying Elizabeth Fortescue (died after 16 April 1652), daughter of John Fortescue and paternal granddaughter of one of the only two married daughters of Sir Geoffrey Pole and Constance Pakenham. By his wife he had four sons, including:

*Sir John Beaumont, 2nd Baronet (d.1643), eldest son and heir, killed at the Siege of Gloucester. He was considered one of the most athletic men of his time. He published some of his father&#x27;s poems, and wrote an enthusiastic elegy on him.
*Gervaise Beaumont, who died in childhood. The circumstances of his death are recorded in one of his father&#x27;s most touching poems.
*Thomas Beaumont, 3rd Baronet

==Death and burial==
He died in April 1627 and was buried on 19 April 1627 in Westminster Abbey. He died intestate and his estate was administered on 3 January 1628/1629. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Sir John Beaumont, 2nd Baronet.

==Works==
Beaumont&#x27;s major work is a poem in twelve books, entitled &quot;The Crown of Thornes&quot;, which was greatly admired in manuscript by Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton and others. Though lost for centuries, scholars have established that a long poem in twelve books contained in a manuscript in the British Library was indeed Beaumont&#x27;s lost major work. In 1629 the 2nd Baronet published a volume of his father&#x27;s works entitled &quot;Bosworth Field; with a taste of the variety of other Poems left by Sir John Beaumont&quot;. No more tastes were ever vouchsafed, so Beaumont&#x27;s reputation rests on this the juvenile &quot;Metamorphosis of Tobacco&quot;. Beaumont&#x27;s favoured medium was the heroic couplet. Bosworth Field, the scene of the battle described in Beaumont&#x27;s principal poem, lay close to the poet&#x27;s residence of Grace-Dieu. He always wrote with a remarkable smoothness, which marks him, with Edmund Waller and George Sandys, as one of the pioneers of the classic reformation of English verse.

The poems of Sir John Beaumont were included in Alexander Chalmers&#x27;s &quot;English Poets&quot;, vol. vi (1810). An edition, with memorial introduction and notes, was included (1869) in Dr AB Grosart&#x27;s &quot;Fuller Worthies Library&quot;; and the &quot;Metamorphosis of Tobacco&quot; was included in JP Collier&#x27;s &quot;Illustrations of Early English Popular Literature&quot;, vol. i. (1863).

In 1998, Featherstone was elected a Councillor for the London Borough of Haringey representing Muswell Hill Ward. She and her two colleagues (June Andersen and Julia Glenn) were the first three Liberal Democrats to be elected borough councillors. She became Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group (and thereby Opposition Leader) on the Council 1998–2003.

Although she stood down from Haringey Council before the May 2006 elections, Featherstone influenced the 2006 local elections in Haringey where Labour&#x27;s majority was cut from 25 to 3, with 30 Labour Councillors elected to 27 Liberal Democrats.

===Member of the London Assembly 2000–2005===
From 2000 until 2005, Featherstone was a Member of the London Assembly; during this time, she was Chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee. She was also a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority for all five years she was on the London Assembly. She was replaced as MLA by Geoff Pope.

Featherstone was promoted by some as a potential Liberal Democrat candidate for Mayor of London in the 2008 election. In response to a poll on the Liberal Democrat Voice website, she ruled herself out, stating that, of the other people in the poll, she would back Brian Paddick.

==Member of Parliament==
Featherstone first contested the Hornsey and Wood Green seat at the 1997 general election where she finished in third place some 25,998 votes behind the winner Barbara Roche. She again fought Hornsey and Wood Green at the 2001 general election, moving into second place and reducing Roche&#x27;s majority to 10,614. In one of the largest swings at the 2005 general election, Featherstone defeated Roche with a majority of 2,395 votes.

She made her maiden speech in Parliament on 24 May 2005. She was appointed as a LibDem junior Home Affairs spokesperson by Charles Kennedy in 2005, and to the environment audit select committee.

She was co-chair of Chris Huhne&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign to be leader of the Liberal Democrats following the resignation of Kennedy in January 2006. In March, following the election of Menzies Campbell as party leader, she was promoted to number two in the Liberal Democrat home affairs team and made London spokesperson. In December 2006, she succeeded Susan Kramer as the Liberal Democrat Shadow International Development Secretary, and two months later was succeeded by Tom Brake as London spokesperson.

In 2007, following the resignation of Sir Menzies Campbell, she again chaired Chris Huhne&#x27;s leadership election campaign. On 20 December 2007 the new Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who defeated Chris Huhne, made her Youth and Equalities spokesperson.

On 5 February 2013, Featherstone voted in favour in the House of Commons Second Reading vote on same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom, the bill which she spearheaded as Minister of State at the Home Office and was passed through the Commons despite Conservative backbench MP resistance. She was given a score of 93% in favour of lesbian, gay and bisexual equality by Stonewall.

In the 2015 general election, she lost her seat to Labour&#x27;s Catherine West.

===Aftermath of death of Peter Connelly===
Following the death of her constituent, 17-month-old Peter Connelly, Haringey Council initiated an internal audit Serious case review (SCR). Although the actual report was completed months earlier, the Executive Summary of the report was released immediately after the resulting court case had completed. The full details of the report have been kept confidential.
Featherstone had been particularly critical of Haringey Council, writing &quot;I personally met with George Meehan and Ita O&#x27;Donovan – Haringey Council&#x27;s Leader and Chief Executive – to raise with them three different cases, where the pattern was in each case Haringey seeming to want to blame anyone who complained rather than to look at the complaint seriously. I was promised action – but despite repeated subsequent requests for news on progress – I was just stonewalled.&quot;

In November 2008, at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, Featherstone asked the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, to order an enquiry into the Connelly case.

===Media attention===
In April 2006, one of Featherstone&#x27;s researchers received a hoax email warning about an apparent date rape drug called Progesterex. Featherstone submitted a written question to the Labour Government Minister enquiring as to &quot;what assessment he has made of the use of Progesterex in cases of date rape&quot;. Paul Goggins&#x27;s reply to the House of Commons was that Progesterex did not exist: &quot;It has been the subject of a hoax e-mail&quot;, he answered. The hoax first originated in 1999. Featherstone criticised the Minister&#x27;s response, stating &quot;they need to do more to discover the unearthly monster who sends them out&quot; and that &quot;their cavalier attitude will not do&quot;. However, critics such as fellow Liberal Democrat James Graham castigated Featherstone&#x27;s conduct in &quot;criticising the Home Office for not having a response to made up drugs and made up crimes&quot;, stating &quot;trivialising rape in this way without bothering to do basic research first doesn&#x27;t help anybody&quot;.

She came to the attention of the national media in 2008 when she was criticised by Conservative Member of the London Assembly Brian Coleman for calling 999 (the UK&#x27;s emergency number) when her boiler began making noises and sparking. Coleman referred to her as a &quot;dizzy airhead&quot;, Featherstone responded by calling his comments &quot;sexist&quot; and &quot;political&quot; in nature. A London Fire Brigade spokeswoman told BBC News: &quot;If it&#x27;s obvious that there has been an ongoing problem with the boiler, then you can call a plumber. But if your boiler suddenly starts making strange noises in the middle of the night, call the fire brigade.&quot;

In January 2013, she tweeted that John Mulholland, editor of &quot;The Observer,&quot; should have been sacked for publishing a &quot;rant against the transgender community&quot; in Julie Burchill&#x27;s column which she described as &quot;bigoted vomit&quot;, receiving a backlash as a result.

Featherstone has expressed intentions to ban topless models from appearing on &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper&#x27;s &quot;Page 3&quot;, stating &quot;I would love to take on &quot;Page 3&quot;&quot;.

===Expenses===
In April 2007, an employee in Featherstone&#x27;s office over-ordered stationery reportedly worth over £22,000 in one month. On being alerted to the over-ordering, Featherstone returned all of the items involved. In a subsequent interview when challenged on the matter Featherstone responded &quot;If I wasn&#x27;t replying to people and telling them what&#x27;s happened about the casework they have brought to me, there would soon be howls of protest. You can judge my overall use of expenses by the Telegraph. They called me one of their &quot;saints&quot;.&quot;

In May 2009, Featherstone was listed among the &quot;saints&quot; by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in the expenses scandal.

===In Government===
Under the Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010 she was appointed as a Minister in the Home Office as Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Criminal Information and Equalities. Featherstone caused waves by pre-announcing her appointment prior to the official announcement in the expectation of forcing compromises from the Tories regarding her policy &quot;aims&quot;, despite Home Secretary Theresa May being noted for not favouring homosexual equality.

In December 2010, Featherstone introduced a move that would allow positive discrimination which is primarily aimed at addressing female under-representation in the workforce. It will also mean that a manager will be able lawfully to hire a black man over a white man, a homosexual man over a heterosexual man, if they have the same skill set. Featherstone, denied the plans were about &quot;political correctness, or red tape, or quotas&quot; and would &quot;help make the workplace fairer&quot;.

In September 2011, Featherstone caused controversy by claiming men make &quot;terrible decisions&quot; when they are in charge. Speaking at the Liberal Democrat Party Conference Featherstone blamed men for the mess the world was in, and commentators drew parallels with similar comments by one of Featherstone&#x27;s predecessors, Harriet Harman. Her comments attracted criticism from across the political spectrum and were considered particularly inappropriate given her role as a minister in charge of ending sexism. Conservative MP Priti Patel said: &quot;these comments are really ill-thought out. As Equalities Minister she has got to be unbiased about the value that both men and women bring to decision-making.&quot; Elizabeth Day of &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper was equally troubled by the remarks, writing &quot;the notion that women are not as aggressive as men, that we would all just sit around a table eating red velvet cupcakes and talking out the world&#x27;s problems rather than firing off phallic-shaped nuclear weapons is a complete fallacy&quot;.

On 5 September 2012 she was confirmed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for International Development. Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow in September 2013, she supported Liberal Democrat policy to prosecute those responsible for cases where girls are sent abroad to have female genital mutilation carried out, or where it is carried out in the UK. In November 2014, she was promoted to Minister of State for Crime Prevention going back to the Home office.

=== After Government ===
Featherstone wrote a book, &quot;Equal Ever After&quot;, describing the details of work to establish legal same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom and her role in the process.

==Awards==
In 2006, Featherstone was shortlisted in the &quot;Rising Stars&quot; category of the Channel 4 political awards, but did not win.

Featherstone was nominated for the Stonewall Politician of the Year Award in both 2009 and 2012 for her work to support equality for lesbian, gay and bisexual people. She was awarded Stonewall Politician of the Year (jointly), Attitude Magazine Politician of the Year and PinkNews Ally of the Year for her initiative on same-sex marriage and work on LGBT rights.

She ranked 26 out of 50 on the Top 50 Lib Dems of 2020 list.

==Personal life==
In 1982, she married Stephen Featherstone in Haringey. Together they have two children. The couple divorced in 1996.

Featherstone lives in Highgate, London. She is Jewish. She is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society.

Her nephew had haemophilia and was victim of the Tainted blood scandal.

<text>George Sandys ( &quot;sands&quot;; 2 March 1578 – March 1644) was an English traveller, colonist, poet, and translator. He was known for his translations of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; and the Passion of Jesus, as well as his travel narratives of the Eastern Mediterranean region, which formed a substantial contribution to geography and ethnology.

==Life==

He was born in Bishopthorpe, the seventh and youngest son of Edwin Sandys, archbishop of York. He studied at St Peter&#x27;s School, York and St Mary Hall, Oxford in 1589, admitted to Middle Temple, 23 October 1596, and later transferred to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, but took no degree. In 1610, he began his travels through Europe and the Middle East, which culminated in his work &quot;The Relation of a Journey begun an. Dom. 1610, in four books&quot;.

Sandys also took great interest in the earliest English colonization in America. In April 1621 he became colonial treasurer of the Virginia Company and sailed to Virginia with his niece&#x27;s husband, Sir Francis Wyatt, the new governor.

When Virginia became a crown colony, Sandys was created a member of council in August 1624; he was reappointed to this post in 1626 and 1628. In 1631, he unsuccessfully applied for the secretaryship to the new special commission for the better plantation of Virginia; soon after this, he returned to England for good.

In 1621, he had already published an English translation, written in basic heroic couplets, of part of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;; this he completed in 1626; on this mainly his poetic reputation rested in the 17th and 18th centuries. Its 1632 edition, featuring extensive commentaries written by Sandys, provided an allegorical reading of Ovid&#x27;s text. He also began a version of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, but never produced more than the first book. In 1636, he issued his famous &quot;Paraphrase upon the Psalms and Hymns dispersed throughout the Old and New Testaments&quot;, he translated Christ&#x27;s Passion from the Latin of Grotius, and, in 1641, he brought out his last work, a &quot;Paraphrase of the Song of Songs&quot;. He died, unmarried, at Boxley, near Maidstone, Kent, in 1644.

His verse was praised by Dryden and Pope; Milton was somewhat indebted to Sandys&#x27;s &quot;Hymn to my Redeemer&quot; (inserted in his travels at the place of his visit to the Holy Sepulchre) in his &quot;Ode on the Passion&quot;.

== Travel and travel writing ==

On his travels through Europe and the Middle East, he first visited France; from north Italy he passed by way of Venice to Constantinople, and thence to Egypt, Mount Sinai, Palestine, Cyprus, Sicily, Naples, and Rome. His narrative, was dedicated to Charles, Prince of Wales and formed a substantial contribution to geography and ethnology. Sandys&#x27; travel narrative appeared as &quot;The Relation of a Journey begun an. Dom. 1610, in four books&quot;. This remained a standard account of the Eastern Mediterranean, twice mentioned, for instance, by the English naval chaplain Henry Teonge in his diary of a voyage in 1675.

The writing of &quot;The Relation&quot; series was influenced by Sandys’ background, as he followed the footsteps of his eldest brother who had previously visited and written about Turkey and the Ottoman Empire. This work contributed to the debates concerning religious tolerance in the early 17th century: Sandys shows that contrary to beliefs of many Western Europeans, multiple religions did not automatically cause social unrest, as exemplified in his descriptions of the Ottoman Empire. Sandys also appears to have been one of the first non-Jewish travelers to refute the belief that Jews &quot;naturally emit an unsavoury odour&quot;. The book was well-received in his time, becoming a standard account of the Eastern Mediterranean, although Sandys has later been critiqued for his attitude towards women in his writing by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.

The seventh edition of &quot;The Relation of a Journey begun an. Dom. 1610, in four books&quot; combined the four books into a single volume, printed for John Williams junior at The Crown in Little Britain in London, 1673. This compilation volume included Sandys’ travels to all above mentioned locations, the first book containing a history of the state of the Turkish Empire, describing their laws, government, policy, military, justice system and commerce. The first book also included Sandys’ description of the Mohammedan religion (Islam), a description of Constantinople and the manner of living of its sultan, and a study of Greece and Greek religion and customs. The second book of &quot;The Relation of a Journey&quot; focused on Egypt and the surrounding area. Sandys gives an account of Egyptian antiquity and culture, as well as his voyage on the Nile river. The second book also includes descriptions of Armenia, Cairo, Rhodes, and a brief history of Alexandria, in decline during the time of Sandys’ visitation. His is the last mention of the tomb of Alexander the Great, although it is likely a mere repetition of the description given by Leo Africanus the earlier century. The third book of the series is a description of Palestine, the Holy Land and the Jewish and Christians living there at the time. In the fourth and final volume of the series present in the compilation &quot;Sandys Travels&quot;, Sandys discusses Italy and describes the islands near it: Cyprus, Crete, Malta, Sicily and the Aeolian Islands. The final volume also includes Sandys’ account of cities and other places of note he visited, amongst which Venice, where his journey began, and Rome. The compilation of these four works, &quot;Sandys Travels,&quot; includes fifty maps and images.

==Theology==
Sandys adopted English Arminian theological views that were reflected in his writings. He included anti-calvinist commentaries in his &quot;Paraphrase upon the Psalms&quot;&quot; (1636). He later translated &quot;Christus Patiens&quot; (1639) a theological and political drama of Arminian theologian Hugo Grotius.

==Family==
His brother Edwin Sandys (same name as his father) was a politician and an influential member of the Virginia Company of London. George Sandys was an uncle of Richard Lovelace (1618–1657), an English poet in the seventeenth century.

<text>William Chalmers (, ; 13 November 1748 – 3 July 1811) was a Swedish merchant and freemason. He was born in Gothenburg in 1748 to the Scottish merchant William Chalmers Sr. and his Swedish wife, Inga Orre. William Chalmers Jr. was eldest amongst his brothers James, George Andreas and Charles Chalmers. He became a director of the Swedish East India Company and in 1783 he was appointed as their resident representative in Canton. He would stay there and in Macau for ten years before returning home. He died in Gothenburg in 1811, leaving half his fortune to the Sahlgrenska hospital, Gothenburg. After some other donations, the remainder was donated to create a crafting school for poor children, which in 1829 became a university that today is named the Chalmers University of Technology.

== Career ==
Chalmers studied commerce and marketing in Gothenburg and Great Britain, before continuing his studies in a travelling manner to France and the Dutch Republic. At the age of 35, he was nominated to become the purchaser of the Swedish East India Company in Canton, China, which became his most enriching investment.

== Swedish East India Company ==
In 1793, when Chalmers was 45 years old, he had been living in Canton for ten years. Afterwards, he returned to Sweden as the manager of the Swedish East India Company as well as the manager of Trollhätte Kanalverk (a canal that runs through Trollhättan). He faithfully contributed to the finalization of the canal and was able to leave the company seven years later (1800). Six years post the finalization of the canal, the last Swedish East India Company-ship arrived into Sweden. On it was merchandise from China and Spain. The imports from Spain and China allowed Sweden to widen its international relations, thus the porcelain from China and the silver from Spain was exported to other countries, as well as Sweden&#x27;s own products: wood, iron and artillery.

<doc id="468958" wikidata="Q312047" url="?curid=468958" title="Schlumbergera truncata">
<text>Schlumbergera truncata, the false Christmas cactus, is a species of plant in the family Cactaceae. Because it produces a flower, it also belongs to the taxonomic group Magnoliophyta and is thus considered an angiosperm. It is endemic to a small area of the coastal mountains of south-eastern Brazil where its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist forests. It is the parent or one of the parents of the houseplants called Christmas cactus, Thanksgiving cactus or zygocactus, among other names.

==Description==

&quot;Schlumbergera truncata&quot; resembles other species of the genus &quot;Schlumbergera&quot; in that it has leafless green stems which act as photosynthetic organs. The stems (cladodes) are composed of strongly flattened segments, which have two or three &quot;teeth&quot; of varying shapes along their edges and at the ends. The ends of the stems are &quot;cut off&quot; (truncated) rather than pointed. Individual segments are about long by wide at full maturity. Variation in size frequently depends on age of segment and access to sunlight and water.

Special structures characteristic of cacti, called &quot;areoles&quot;, occur between two teeth at the end of segments. The areoles, which have brown wool and bristles up to long, are where the flower buds appear and additional segments grow. The flowers are held at a constant angle somewhat above the horizontal with the higher side different from the lower side (zygomorphic, specifically bilaterally symmetrical). The flowers are about long by across. There are six to eight tepals, which may be of various colours, including shades of red, orange, pink and white. The outer tepals (those at the base of the flower) are shorter and bent backwards, the inner tepals are longer and fused together at the base to form a floral tube; nectar is produced at the base of this tube. The lower inner petals are bent backwards so that the upper inner petals appear longer. Plants flower in the autumn: around May in their natural habitat, in October to November in cultivation in the Northern Hemisphere; short days and long nights are necessary to induce flowering. Due to its unique flowering schedule, these structures are significant for differentiating between different Cactaceae species as they affect characteristics like nectar production and function.

A characteristic of the genus &quot;Schlumbergera&quot; is that the many stamens are arranged in two series: the inner stamens form a ring around the style; the outer stamens arise from the floral tube. The filaments of the stamens are white, the anthers and pollen being yellow. The style has six to eight lobes at its end and is dark red. Additionally, &quot;Schlumbergera truncata&quot; specifically has unique reproductive characteristics from that of &quot;Schlumbergera&quot; as a whole which includes varied seed development, germination, and fruit production.

When ripe, the fruit is red, pear-shaped, and about long or exceptionally up to long. The shiny seeds are black, each with a diameter of about . 

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Schlumbergera truncata&quot; is considered to be part of the Magnoliophyta taxonomic group and can also be referred to as an angiosperm. The epithet &quot;truncata&quot; means &quot;abruptly cut off&quot;, and refers to the shape of the ends of the stems.

The species was first properly named for science by Haworth in 1819 as &quot;Epiphyllum truncatum&quot;. His name was based on living specimens growing at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 1818. (However these do not appear to have been preserved, so an illustration published by W.J. Hooker in 1822 was designated as the &quot;neotype&quot; by N.P. Taylor.) Like others in the genus, the species was transferred to &quot;Zygocactus&quot; by Schumann in 1890, and then to &quot;Schlumbergera&quot; by Moran in 1953. Some other names in the genus &quot;Epiphyllum&quot; are now considered to be synonyms of &quot;S. truncata&quot;.

Synonyms include:

*&quot;Cactus truncatus&quot; , nomen nudum
*&quot;Epiphyllum truncatum&quot; 
*&quot;Cactus truncatus&quot; 
*&quot;Cereus truncatus&quot; 
*&quot;Zygocactus truncatus&quot; 
*&quot;Epiphyllum altensteinii&quot; 
*&quot;Zygocactus altensteinii&quot; 
*&quot;Epiphyllum delicatum&quot; 
*&quot;Zygocactus delicatum&quot; 
*&quot;Epiphyllum ruckeri&quot; 

&quot;Epiphyllum bridgesii&quot; , &quot;Schlumbergera bridgesii&quot; and &quot;Epiphyllum ruckerianum&quot; have sometimes been treated as synonyms of &quot;S. truncata&quot;, but are regarded by David Hunt as synonyms of the hybrid &quot;S.&quot; × &quot;buckleyi&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

&quot;Schlumbergera truncata&quot; occurs only in a small area of the coastal mountains of south-east Brazil, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, located in the southernmost part of the tropics. Sites where it has been found include the Organ Mountains (Serra dos Órgãos) in the Parque Nacional da Serra dos Órgãos and in the Serra do Mar near to the city of Rio de Janeiro. Plants grow at altitudes of . Because of their altitude and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, the coastal mountains have high humidity – warm moist air is forced upwards into higher, colder locations where it condenses. &quot;S. truncata&quot; usually grows on trees (epiphytic), or on rocks (epilythic). The native status of &quot;S. truncata&quot; has become confused because European cultivars were deliberately introduced into some areas, including the Parque Nacional da Serra dos Órgãos, by the Brazilian Agricultural Department, to compensate for over-collecting of wild plants. These climates are effective for &quot;Schlumbergera truncata&quot; due to its moisture content preferences. Humidity and moisture have significant affects on viability of pollen, thus shaping climate distribution for outdoor growth. 

==Cultivation==

&quot;Schlumbergera truncata&quot; is mainly grown as cultivars of the species or of its hybrids with other species of the genus, particularly &quot;S. russelliana&quot;. These plants and their cultivation are discussed at &quot;Schlumbergera:&quot; Cultivation. There are cultivation differences between &quot;Schlumbergera truncata&quot; and other &quot;Schlumbergera&quot; species largely because &quot;Schlumbergera truncata&quot; are the variety that grow outdoors rather than the houseplants which are grown and sold commercially. Some &quot;Schlumbergera truncata&quot; plants have self fertilizing abilities whereas the majority of &quot;Schlumbergera species&quot; are self-incompatible.

<doc id="468974" wikidata="Q39220" url="?curid=468974" title="Fox Terrier">
<text>Fox Terriers are two different breeds of the terrier dog type: the Smooth Fox Terrier and the Wire Fox Terrier. Both of these breeds originated in the 19th century from a handful of dogs who are descended from earlier varieties of British terriers, and are related to other modern white terrier breeds. In addition, a number of breeds have diverged from these two main types of fox terrier and have been recognised separately, including the Jack Russell Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier and Rat Terrier. The Wire and Smooth Fox Terriers share similar characteristics, the main differences being in the coat and markings. They have been successful in conformation shows, more prominently in America than their homeland.

==History==
English physician John Caius described the English terrier type in his 1577 work &quot;English Dogges&quot;. By the 18th century, it was recorded that all terriers were wire haired, and black and tan in colour. The earliest record of any white terrier was a dog named Pitch, who was owned by Colonel Thomas Thornton in 1790. The dog was the subject of a painting by Sawrey Gilpin, who created a portrait of it while it was still alive. An engraving of this painting, made prior to 1810, was accompanied by the text, &quot;It would be necessary to notice Colonel Thorton&#x27;s terriers if they were only on account of his justly celebrated Pitch, from whom are descended most of the white terriers in the kingdom.&quot; Dog writers of the early 20th century suggested that Pitch was a terrier-greyhound cross, which was how the colour was introduced into the breed.

Not much is known of early 19th century breeding practices that came to create the modern Fox Terrier. However it is thought that the Beagle, Old English Bulldog, English Toy Terrier, Pointer and even Dalmatian were all used in the creation and stabilisation of the breed.

From 1870 onwards, a complete pedigree for Fox Terriers exists. Three dogs, known as Old Jock, Trap and Tartar, are the ancestors of most modern strains of white terrier. Old Jock was bred from a black and tan terrier, while Trap was from the strain out of Reverend John &quot;Jack&quot; Russell&#x27;s dogs. Russell would later have the Jack Russell Terrier series of breeds named after him. Although definitive history on Tartar is not known, he is also thought to have come from black and tan terrier stock. Of the female dogs from this period, Grove Nettle was the best known. In addition to those dogs, another named Old Tip is thought to be the forefather of the modern Wire Fox Terrier.

The terrier of this period was short of leg, built in a chunky fashion, and had a skull that was broad across the top. Used in hunting packs and kept in kennels along with English Foxhounds, they were bred for their ability to drive the fox out of its den. Gradually the pace of the hunt became faster, and the terriers were bred with longer legs for more speed towards the end of the 18th century. However the increased size meant that the Fox Terrier became too big to be used for its original purpose, and its use in fox hunting began to decline.

The Fox Terrier Club of England was founded in 1876, with the American Fox Terrier Club following nine years later, becoming the first breed speciality club to become a member of the American Kennel Club. A female Smooth Fox Terrier bred by Winthrop Rutherfurd named Warren Remedy was the first winner of Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1907, 1908, and 1909. Following the popularity of conformation dog shows, the Fox Terrier was the result of selective breeding. For instance, by 1949, 120 of 140 Wire Fox Terrier champions were descended from a single championship-winning dog.

==Modern breeds==
There are two main breeds of Fox Terrier, Smooth and Wire, both of which originate in England. In addition, there are several descendant breeds which have been developed in a variety of countries. For example, the American Toy Fox Terrier was developed from the Smooth Fox Terrier, Italian Greyhound, Manchester Terrier, Miniature Pinscher and Chihuahua breeds.

Both major types of Fox Terrier are mostly white with coloured markings and have similar facial characteristics. They are essentially the same except for differences in coats, and slight differences in colouration and markings. Markings on either type can appear black at birth on the head, but may lighten in adult life, the most common colours being tan and black. The markings are a type of piebald spotting. Although the two main breeds were originally commonly interbred, this no longer occurs in pure-bred lines.

The Fox Terrier has been more successful than any other breed at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, with four Best in Show titles going to the Smooth Fox Terrier and fourteen titles going to the Wire Fox Terrier. They were both shown as one breed with two coat variations; this changed in 1985 when the American Kennel Club listed the two as separate breeds. In the UK, at Crufts, the Smooth Fox Terrier has not won any Best in Show titles, while the Wire Fox Terrier has won on three occasions.

===Smooth Fox Terrier===

The Smooth Fox Terrier has a short, hard coat which is predominantly white. It measures at the withers, and weighs between . The head of this breed is long and wedge shaped, with small, dark eyes and ears that are v-shaped.

The breed has been identified as one of several Vulnerable Native Breeds in the UK. This is when there are fewer than 300 annual registrations with The Kennel Club. In 2010, there were 155 Smooth Fox Terriers registered, compared to 693 for the Wire Fox Terrier and 8,663 for the most popular breed in the Terrier Group, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

The most successful dog at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show was Ch. Warren Remedy, who won the Best in Show title three times between 1907 and 1909. These victories were followed by a further Best in Show title for Ch. Sabine Rarebit in 1910. Despite the Smooth Fox Terrier breed winning the first four Best in Show titles at Westminster, it has not won again since.

===Wire Fox Terrier===

The Wire Haired Fox Terrier has a hard and crisp double coat with a coarse texture underneath that provides protection from the cold. It should be so dense that the skin cannot be seen or felt. The individual hairs should twist, but are not curly. An average member of the breed should measure at the withers and weigh . It has similar features to the Smooth Fox Terrier, with small dark eyes and v-shaped ears. Its body is shorter than it is tall.

King Edward VII owned a Wire Fox Terrier from the Notts kennel called Caesar of Notts, which did a great deal to popularise the breed at the turn of the 20th century. Another member of the Notts kennel was an early winner of Best Champion at Crufts in 1911 named Collarbone of Notts. Other individual dogs that greatly influenced the breed included Ch. Talavera Simon, born in 1924, and Ch. Zeloy Emperor, born in 1960.

===Descendant breeds===
==Common health issues==
Myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disease, is hereditary in the Smooth Fox Terrier through an autosomal recessive gene. This can also be a symptom of megaesophagus, which is a health issue for the Wire Fox Terrier. Another hereditary condition in the Smooth Fox Terrier is cataracts, which is more prevalent than average in the breed. Both types of Fox Terrier can be susceptible to allergies.

In a survey conducted by The Kennel Club, the primary cause of death for Fox Terriers was old age, causing 31.8% of reported deaths. The secondary cause was cancer of an unspecified type, which accounted for 22.7% of reports. The average lifespan of a Fox Terrier is around 15 years; the Kennel Club survey reported a median age at death of 13 years and 2 months.

The wire-haired Fox Terrier is predisposed to atopic dermatitis.

<doc id="468975" wikidata="Q333121" url="?curid=468975" title="Patrick Buchan-Hepburn, 1st Baron Hailes">
<text>Patrick George Thomas Buchan-Hepburn, 1st Baron Hailes, (2 April 1901 – 5 November 1974) was a British Conservative politician and the only Governor-General of the short-lived West Indies Federation from 1958 to 1962.

== Background and education ==

Buchan-Hepburn was the youngest son of Sir Archibald Buchan-Hepburn, 4th Baronet (see Buchan-Hepburn baronets) and his wife Edith Agnes (née Karslake). He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge.

== Career ==

Buchan-Hepburn was a personal secretary to Winston Churchill and a London County Councillor. Having stood unsuccessfully for election as a Member of Parliament (MP) in Wolverhampton East at the 1929 general election, he became MP for the East Toxteth division of Liverpool following a by-election in February 1931. In 1939, he was appointed a Parliamentary Whip for the Conservative Party and a Lord of the Treasury. During World War II, he served in the military.

Returning to politics in 1945, Buchan-Hepburn became Deputy Whip and then, in 1948, Chief Whip. He was elected MP for the newly created Beckenham constituency in Kent after his East Toxteth constituency was abolished by boundary changes before the 1950 general election. From 1951 to 1955, he was Government Chief Whip and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury. In 1957, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Hailes of Prestonkirk in the County of East Lothian. Lord Hailes was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in September 1957.

When, in 1958, the West Indies Federation was formed in response to complaints against British colonialism in the Caribbean, Lord Hailes was appointed the Federation&#x27;s first Governor-General and relocated to Port of Spain on the island of Trinidad. Four years later, the new state was dissolved and he returned to England, where he served as Chairman of the Historic Buildings Council (a predecessor of English Heritage, formally known as the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England).

In the 1962 Birthday Honours Lord Hailes was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.

== Personal life ==

Buchan-Hepburn married Diana Mary, daughter of Brigadier-General the Hon. Charles Lambton and war widow of Major William Hedworth Williamson, in 1945. They had no children. He was step-father to Diana&#x27;s son, Sir Nicholas Frederick Hedworth Williamson, 11th Baronet.

Buchan-Hepburn died in November 1974, aged 73, whence his barony became extinct.

<doc id="468994" wikidata="Q335586" url="?curid=468994" title="John Birt, Baron Birt">
<text>John Birt, Baron Birt (born 10 December 1944) is a British television executive and businessman. He is a former Director-General (1992–2000) of the BBC.

After a successful career in commercial television, initially at Granada Television and later at London Weekend Television, Birt was appointed Deputy Director-General of the BBC in 1987 for his expertise in current affairs. The forced departure of Director-General Alasdair Milne after pressure from the Thatcher government required someone near the top, preferably from outside the BBC, with editorial and production experience (Milne had been summarily replaced by Michael Checkland, an accountant).

During his tenure as Director-General, Birt restructured the BBC, in the face of much internal opposition. However, others have credited him with saving the corporation from possible government privatisation, and say he prepared for the era of digital broadcasting. After leaving the BBC, Birt was Strategic Advisor to Prime Minister Tony Blair from 2001 to 2005. 
He was appointed Chairman of CPA Global in 2015.

==Early life and commercial television career==
Birt was born in Liverpool to a Catholic father, a manager at the Firestone tyre company, and a Protestant mother. He was raised as a Catholic, and educated at the direct-grant grammar school St. Mary&#x27;s College, Crosby, near Liverpool and read engineering at St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford, graduating from Oxford University with a third-class degree in engineering.

From 1966 to 1971, Birt worked for Granada Television, where he devised and produced the magazine programme &quot;Nice Time&quot; before joining Granada&#x27;s &quot;World in Action&quot; current affairs series. Birt persuaded Mick Jagger, who had just spent three nights in Brixton prison for possession of drugs, to participate in a 1967 edition of &quot;World in Action&quot; in which Jagger conversed with the editor of &quot;The Times&quot; (William Rees-Mogg) and the Bishop of Woolwich (John A. T. Robinson), among others. It was hailed as a &quot;dialogue between generations.&quot; With Gus Macdonald, Birt became joint editor of &quot;World in Action&quot; in 1969.

Birt moved from Granada to London Weekend Television in 1971. At LWT he was the founding editor and executive producer of the current affairs programme &quot;Weekend World&quot;. He became head of current affairs at LWT and, later, controller of features and current affairs. With &quot;Weekend World&quot; presenter Peter Jay, Birt contributed a series of three articles to &quot;The Times&quot; on the topic of television journalism. They argued that most television news and current affairs contained a &quot;bias against understanding&quot;: pictures had taken precedence over analysis. Instead they advocated &quot;a mission to explain&quot;. Makers of news and documentary programmes were required to outline their finished product in writing before setting out with a camera crew. Such an argument, was not universally accepted. Years later, in 2006, Alasdair Milne, the former BBC Director-General, said he thought Birt&#x27;s &quot;bias against understanding&quot; argument was nonsense.

In the mid-1970s, he took a break from LWT to produce David Frost&#x27;s &quot;The Nixon Interviews&quot; with the disgraced former US President Richard Nixon. In the 1977 interviews, watched by 45 million people, Nixon admitted his part in the scandal which had led to his resignation.

Birt returned to LWT as director of programmes in 1982. During this period he revived the career of his old friend, the Liverpool singer Cilla Black, who in due course became the highest-paid female performer on UK television. Birt formed a close working relationship with his boss at LWT, Michael Grade, although this would later sour when both were working at the BBC.

==BBC career==
Birt&#x27;s success at LWT prompted the BBC&#x27;s governors to appoint him Deputy Director-General in 1987 under Michael Checkland. Birt also served as the BBC&#x27;s director of news and current affairs at this time.

Birt&#x27;s promotion to Director-General in 1992 caused controversy when it was revealed he was employed on a freelance consultancy basis. Under political and public pressure, Birt became a BBC employee. He had to sell his shares in LWT, losing out on a windfall of what would have been several million pounds when it was bought by Granada in 1994. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; later revealed that Birt had been a member of the Labour Party at the time of his appointment, a concern to Conservatives who had already expressed concerns about alleged left-wing bias at the organisation.

As Director-General, Birt was tasked with securing the BBC&#x27;s future at a time of rapid technical, cultural and economic changes in world broadcasting. In seven years, Birt restructured and modernised the corporation which he wanted to make &quot;the best managed public sector organisation&quot;. Birt imposed a policy of radical change to deliver efficiency savings. In April 1993 he introduced Producer Choice, giving programme makers the power to buy services from outside the BBC. This theoretically reduced the cost to licence-payers of the BBC&#x27;s historic resource base. Faced with high rental fees from the BBC&#x27;s record library, producers found it cheaper to buy records from local record shops. In-house facilities were closed or stood idle, allegedly as a result of Birt&#x27;s &quot;creative accounting&quot; methods.

Above all, Birt is credited with preparing the organisation for the new landscape shaped by digitalisation – preparations that were &quot;far in advance of the BBC&#x27;s terrestrial rivals&quot;, according to the academic Georgina Born. At the 1996 Edinburgh Television Festival, Birt said that without the resources to prepare for the digital age, the BBC would be &quot;history&quot;. Birt asserted that the changes made the BBC more agile, more competitive and allowed it to expand beyond its traditional broadcasting services, but remaining licence-fee funded. He was one of the driving forces behind the launch of continuous news output and he took much money from traditional services to fund the 24-hour news channel and advance on the internet. However, such ventures were criticised by many as being clearly detrimental to BBC core programming.

Birt has argued that without his changes, the BBC&#x27;s operating charter might not have been renewed in the 1990s. Birt&#x27;s advocates include the journalists John Lloyd, John Simpson and Polly Toynbee. Birt&#x27;s use of impenetrable jargon became known as &quot;Birtspeak&quot;, a phenomenon mocked in the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;, complete with a miniature Dalek caricature of Birt. The comparison originated from playwright Dennis Potter, who labeled Birt a &quot;croak-voiced Dalek&quot; in his MacTaggart Lecture delivered in August 1993 at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. The BBC&#x27;s post-production department made a Christmas tape casting Birt as Davros, the head of the Daleks, which was alluded to many years later on a BBC DVD commentary for &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; by former director David Maloney. Journalist Mark Lawson wrote at the time that Potter&#x27;s &quot;tendency towards unfocused vitriol and noisy self-examination made his contribution easily swattable by the BBC&#x27;s damage controllers&quot;. Birt himself did not agree with his critics&#x27; portrait of the BBC of the time, but did allow that drama was a source of concern. &quot;The originality is not there as it was in the Sixties&quot;, he said.

One of Birt&#x27;s predecessors, Alasdair Milne, said Birt did little good for the BBC apart from establishing its internet service and criticised him for paying consultants large fees for the corporation&#x27;s restructuring. Many others opposed Birt, his methods and his reforms, including the journalists John Tusa, Mark Tully and Charles Wheeler, and news correspondent Kate Adie. Radio broadcaster John Dunn believed morale was bad under Birt, while David Attenborough commented that producers spend too much time worrying about money as a result of Birt&#x27;s reforms.

Birt&#x27;s arrival at the BBC hastened the departure of executive Bill Cotton, who described his tenure as a &quot;nightmare&quot; for the BBC. Marmaduke Hussey, who appointed Birt to his BBC role, later claimed to have regrets. Some of Birt&#x27;s changes were partially dismantled by his successors Greg Dyke and Mark Thompson. However, producer Tony Garnett claimed in 2009 that Birt&#x27;s legacy of &quot;totalitarian micro management&quot; has existed at the BBC ever since.
In 1998, Birt imposed a ban on BBC output mentioning the private life of Peter Mandelson. This order followed an edition of &quot;Newsnight&quot;, during which Matthew Parris had said that Mandelson was homosexual. Peter Ainsworth, the Conservative shadow Culture Secretary, questioned whether this was a generic ban on mentioning private issues or specific to Mandelson.

Birt was succeeded as Director-General by Greg Dyke who also had ties to the Labour Party.

==Post-BBC career==
===Advisor to Tony Blair===
Birt was brought into Number 10 to lead the development of long-term strategy for the government on key areas of public policy. Tony Blair asked him to produce a report on solutions to crime, and he served as advisor on Criminal Justice from 2000 to 2001. The establishment of a Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) was an idea originally conceived by Birt.

Birt was made unpaid Strategy Adviser to Blair in 2001, appointed for what was termed &quot;blue skies thinking&quot; and claimed by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to be &quot;worth every penny&quot;; Blair wanted advice from outside the traditional Whitehall mindset – he had known Birt since the 1980s and approved of his analytical approach. Jeremy Heywood, Blair&#x27;s principal private secretary, said: &quot;He liked the way that John was willing to get right down into the data and understand the evidence, and come up with a real sense that you could do things in a totally different way.&quot; Birt supervised the development of long-term strategy on drugs, health, crime reduction, education, transport and London. His 2004 report on drug policy recommended making heroin use a criminal offence on par with possession.

However, Birt&#x27;s recommendations made him unpopular with some ministers and Blair&#x27;s decision to ask Birt for a &quot;private&quot; report on crime irritated Jack Straw and the Home Office. In 2002, he proposed a second network of motorways operated as tolls to counter the problems of traffic congestion.

Many saw Birt&#x27;s role in government as controversial, since as a special advisor, rather than a civil servant, he was not formally obliged to face questions from House of Commons select committees. In October 2002 it emerged that the government had specifically asked him not to appear in front of the transport select committee, at a time when he was in charge of long-term transport strategy.

Blair asked Birt to help him define his main domestic policy priorities so he could develop precise plans for the period after the 2005 election. Birt had first proposed the idea of the &quot;five-year plans&quot; in 2003 and was now responsible for overseeing the Third Term Plan. This included the overall policy programme, machinery of government changes and the legislative timetable. A special project team to develop the third term was led by Birt and Turnbull and reported regularly to the prime minister. Birt&#x27;s team produced detailed proposals with a precise grid on how to implement policy.

Concurrently, Birt served as an advisor at McKinsey &amp; Company&#x27;s Global Media Practice from 2000 to 2005. His relationship with government and McKinsey caused some controversy as McKinsey were increasingly working with UK government departments in a range of public service and defence areas. Birt remained at Number 10 as an unpaid adviser until December 2005, when he left to join private equity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners as an adviser.

The &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported at the beginning of July 2005 that Birt&#x27;s office ceiling at 10 Downing Street had fallen in. However, Birt was not injured.

===Later business career===
From 2006 to 2010, he was an adviser for consulting firm Capgemini on strategic issues, with a focus on the public sector and its Telecom, Media and Entertainment practice. Birt served as chairman of Lynx New Media (subsequently Lynx Capital Ventures) from 2000 to 2004. He was chairman of Waste Recycling Group and subsequently non-executive director of Infinis, a generator of renewable power. He also served chairman of Maltby Capital from 2007 to 2010.

Birt was chairman of PayPal Europe between 2010 and 2014, having joined the board in 2004. He later served periods as chairman of Host Europe Group (2013–2017) and CPA Global (2015–2017).

He is currently Vice-Chairman of Eutelsat, having joined the board as an independent director in 2006.

==Honours and awards==
Birt received an Emmy in 1995, for his &quot;outstanding contribution&quot; to international television.

Birt was awarded a knighthood, and on 11 February 2000 he was created a life peer as Baron Birt, of Liverpool in the County of Merseyside. He took his seat in the House of Lords in March 2000 as a crossbencher.

===Crossbencher in the House of Lords===
Birt is an active cross-bencher in the House of Lords, speaking out in 2011 and 2012 in favour of government&#x27;s proposed Health and Social Care Bill. Birt&#x27;s special interests include the Media/ Broadcasting/ Communications Industry, Climate Change/ Environment, Criminal Justice and Education

In 2013 Birt voiced his opinion to the House of Lords on the Gay Marriage bill stating &quot;this bill goes the whole hog and rightly allows gay couples, if they wish, to make the powerful statements of love and commitment that marriage proclaims. If gay couples want that option, they should have it.&quot;

In 2014 Birt showed his support for the assisted dying legislation, in the House of Lords debate, in which participants were evenly split. Before the 2014 Scottish referendum, Bird argued that Scottish independence would have a devastating impact on the BBC. In 2015, he led criticism of the decision for the BBC to start funding TV licences for over-75s, calling it a &quot;deeply shocking announcement&quot;.

==Later reflections on broadcasting career==
Returning to his earlier career on 26 August 2005, Birt delivered his second MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. Partly a review of his professional life as a broadcaster, he also criticised the &quot;tabloidisation&quot; of intellectual concerns. He argued that Channel 4 should receive financial help, in order to preserve &quot;public service broadcasting&quot;, which was taken as advocacy of the BBC sharing its licence fee with Channel Four, so called &quot;top slicing&quot;. He also mentioned that his long-standing feud with Michael Grade had been resolved, but the speech as a whole was not admired by many figures in the industry.

Following Director-General George Entwistle&#x27;s resignation in November 2012, James Purnell argued that the new Director-General &quot;should learn from the Birt era&quot; stating that it was Birt&#x27;s &quot;boldness&quot; that saved the BBC. Instead of playing it safe and avoiding mistakes, he said, Birt transformed output and embraced the internet, and rebuilt relationships with government, business and the public. Media commentator Steve Hewlett, Birt&#x27;s former colleague and friend, suggested in 2012 that it might be time for the BBC &quot;to bring in Birt 2.0&quot;. Hewlett acknowledged that many of Birt&#x27;s reforms were unpopular, but said that without them, &quot;it is questionable whether the BBC would exist in anything like its present capable and competitive form, or indeed would have retained the huge affection of audiences&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Birt is portrayed by Matthew Macfadyen in &quot;Frost/Nixon (film)&quot;.
Birt is portrayed by Nicholas Gleaves in the fifth season of &quot;The Crown&quot;.

On television, he has appeared in &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (1984), &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1998–2000), and &quot;Adventure Inc.&quot; (2002–2003). Biehn received a Best Actor Saturn Award nomination for &quot;Aliens&quot;.

==Early life==
Biehn was born in Anniston, Alabama, the second of three boys born to Marcia (née Connell) and Don Biehn, a lawyer. His surname is of German origin.

When Biehn was young, he moved with his family to Lincoln, Nebraska, and then to Lake Havasu City, Arizona, where he was a member of the high school drama club before graduating. He attended the drama program at the University of Arizona, where he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity before moving to Hollywood.

==Career==
Biehn got his start in films with a small part in &quot;Grease&quot; (1978). He appears in two scenes; in one scene, John Travolta&#x27;s character, Danny, hits Biehn&#x27;s uncredited character in the stomach while playing basketball. Shortly thereafter, he appeared in the 1978 made for television movie, &quot;A Fire in the Sky&quot;. In 1981, Biehn appeared in the role of Douglas Breen, a stalker, in the 1981 film version of Bob Randall&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fan&quot;, starring Lauren Bacall. On television, Biehn made a guest appearance on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;.

In 1984, Biehn played Sgt. Kyle Reese, a soldier sent back in time by John Connor to save his mother, Sarah Connor, in the film &quot;The Terminator&quot;. Biehn appeared opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton; the film was directed by James Cameron. Biehn stated in 2019 that he was initially not enthusiastic about appearing in a Schwarzenegger film, as he had hoped to act alongside the likes of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Biehn went on to have a small role in the sequel, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991), briefly reprising his role as Reese in a scene cut from the final film but restored for the Director&#x27;s Cut version. In 2019, Biehn confirmed in an interview that he would not be reprising the role for &quot;&quot; or any other future installments.

Biehn starred in a second film directed by James Cameron: &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), in which he portrayed Corporal Hicks, a corporal in the Colonial Marines. Originally, Hicks was to be portrayed by James Remar, who was fired from &quot;Aliens&quot; shortly after production started. Cameron chose Biehn as a last-minute replacement, being familiar with Biehn as they previously worked together on &quot;The Terminator&quot;, so Biehn could immediately begin filming without having to go through &quot;boot camp&quot; training as the rest of the cast had done. Due to his late casting, Biehn was unable to customize his character&#x27;s combat armor as the other actors had done. Biehn rejected the padlock heart motif that he was given, joking that it was like a giant bullseye on his chest. Sigourney Weaver, who portrayed protagonist Ellen Ripley in &quot;Aliens&quot;, praised Biehn for bringing &quot;a sensitivity to the role of Hicks, an alpha male who had no problem following a woman&#x27;s lead&quot;. For his work in &quot;Aliens&quot;, Biehn was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actor.

In an early draft of &quot;Alien 3&quot; written by William Gibson, Biehn&#x27;s character Hicks, who had survived the events of &quot;Aliens&quot;, was to become the protagonist, replacing Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). Walter Hill and David Giler wrote the final script, which had Hicks killed off in the opening scene. Biehn, furious upon learning of his character&#x27;s demise, demanded and received almost as much money for the use of his likeness in one scene as he had been paid for his entire role in &quot;Aliens&quot;. Biehn reprised the role of Hicks by voicing the character in the video game &quot;&quot; and again in 2019 for an audio drama adaptation of Gibson&#x27;s un-filmed script for &quot;Alien 3&quot; released by Audible.

Biehn had his third collaboration with James Cameron in &quot;The Abyss&quot; (1989), portraying Lieutenant Hiram Coffey who suffers from high-pressure nervous syndrome. Biehn received strong reviews for his performance, with the studio lobbying unsuccessfully for him to be nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.

Biehn played the role of Johnny Ringo in &quot;Tombstone&quot;, including in the showdown scene with Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday.

Biehn portrayed a Navy SEAL for the third time in the action film &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996). While &quot;The Rock&quot; was the most successful film of Biehn&#x27;s career in terms of box office gross, it saw his billing and screen time diminished, and after that he never landed another part in a big-budget Hollywood film.

Later, Biehn took acting roles ranging from low-budget films such as &quot;The Art of War&quot; and &quot;Clockstoppers&quot; to video games like &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun&quot; and independent movies, such as &quot;Havoc&quot;. He starred in three TV series including the CBS drama &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1998–2000), the Tribune Entertainment syndicated TV series &quot;Adventure Inc.&quot; (2002–2003), and the NBC TV series &quot;Hawaii&quot; (2004). All three shows were cancelled because of low ratings. Biehn was considered to portray Colonel Miles Quaritch, the main antagonist of James Cameron&#x27;s science fiction epic film &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009), but Cameron felt his appearance in the film coupled with that of Weaver would remind people too much of &quot;Aliens&quot;.

Biehn directed the 2010 film &quot;The Blood Bond&quot;. In 2011 he wrote, directed and starred in &quot;The Victim&quot;. In 2020, Biehn was cast as the villain Lang in the second season of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; television series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;. In 2022, he portrayed Ian in the eleventh season of the AMC horror series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;.

==Personal life==
 Coinciding with the decline of his acting career during the 1990s, Biehn suffered from alcoholism until the mid-2000s. Biehn suffered a stroke around 2008 and had open heart surgery. When questioned on why he did not attain stardom despite having lead roles in well-regarded hit films like &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;, Biehn told the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; &quot;People always talk about me being an &#x27;80s star. I was not an &#x27;80s star. Bruce Willis was an &#x27;80s star. Tom Cruise was an &#x27;80s star. Schwarzenegger and Stallone. Mel Gibson. Those guys were making $20 million [a picture]. I never even got $1 million. I kind of liked it that way.&quot;

Biehn remains financially comfortable due to his Screen Actors Guild pension. James Cameron suggested that &quot;what held Michael back was that he didn&#x27;t like playing the Hollywood game — schmoozing people and all that. For him it was all about the work&quot;. Biehn has never hired a publicist and was reportedly never interested in the &quot;fame aspect of the business, even though his agent — and Cameron — both believed he had what it took to be a major star&quot;. 

Biehn has been married three times and has five sons. In 2019, he stated that he had prioritized his family over his acting career by turning down projects involving long film shoots. Biehn&#x27;s second wife was Gina Marsh. As of 2016, Biehn is married to actress Jennifer Blanc, who co-produced and starred alongside him in &quot;The Victim&quot;. The couple has one son, Dashiell King Biehn.

<text>Vodafone Group Plc () is a British multinational telecommunications company. Its registered office and global headquarters are in Newbury, Berkshire, England. It predominantly operates services in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Oceania.

, Vodafone owns and operates networks in 15 countries, with partner networks in 46 further countries. Its Vodafone Global Enterprise division provides telecommunications and IT services to corporate clients in 150 countries.

Vodafone has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company has a secondary listing on the NASDAQ as American depositary receipts (ADRs).

==Name==
The name Vodafone comes from voice data fone (the latter a sensational spelling of &quot;phone&quot;), chosen by the company to &quot;reflect the provision of voice and data services over mobile phones&quot;.

==History==

===Racal Telecom: 1980 to 1991===
In 1980, Ernest Harrison, then chairman of Racal Electronics Plc – the UK&#x27;s largest manufacturer of military radios – negotiated a deal with Lord Weinstock of the UK General Electric Company (GEC), which gave Racal access to some of GEC&#x27;s battlefield radio technology. Harrison directed the head of Racal&#x27;s military radio division, Gerry Whent, to explore the use of that technology for civilian purposes. Whent visited a mobile radio factory run by the US company General Electric (unrelated to UK GEC) in Virginia, that same year. In 1981, the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary was established.

Jan Stenbeck, head of a growing Swedish conglomerate, set up an American company, Millicom Inc, and approached Gerry Whent in July 1982 about bidding jointly for the UK&#x27;s second cellular radio licence. The two struck a deal giving Racal 60% of the new company, Racal-Millicom Ltd, and Millicom 40%. Due to concerns of the Government of the United Kingdom about foreign ownership, the terms were revised, and in December 1982 the Racal-Millicom partnership was awarded the second UK mobile phone network licence. Final ownership of Racal-Millicom Ltd was 80% Racal, with Millicom holding 15% plus royalties, and the venture firm Hambros Technology Trust holding 5%. According to the UK Secretary of State for Business and Trade, &quot;the bid submitted by Racal-Millicom Ltd … provided the best prospect for early national coverage by cellular radio.&quot;

Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985 under the new name of Racal-Vodafone (Holdings) Ltd, with its first office based in the Courtyard in Newbury, Berkshire, and shortly thereafter Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited. The first non-Vodafone employee to make a UK mobile phone call was comedian Ernie Wise, from St Katharine Docks, London on 1 January 1985. On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics issued shares to the minority shareholders of Vodafone worth £110 million, and Vodafone became a fully owned brand of Racal.

On 26 October 1988, Racal Telecom, majority held by Racal Electronics, went public on the London Stock Exchange with 20% of its stock floated. The successful flotation led to a situation where Racal&#x27;s stake in Racal Telecom Plc was valued more than the whole of Racal Electronics. Under stock market pressure to realise full value for shareholders, Racal demerged Racal Telecom in 1991.

===Vodafone Group: 1991 to 1999===
On 16 September 1991, Racal Telecom was demerged from Racal Electronics as Vodafone Group Plc, with Gerry Whent as its CEO.

In July 1996, Vodafone acquired the two-thirds of Talkland it did not already own for £30.6 million. On 19 November 1996, in a defensive move, Vodafone purchased for £77 million Peoples Phone, a 181-store chain whose customers were overwhelmingly using Vodafone&#x27;s network. In a similar move the company acquired the 80% that it did not already own of Astec Communications, a service provider with 21 stores.

In January 1997, Whent retired and Chris Gent took over as CEO. In the same year, Vodafone introduced its &quot;Speechmark&quot; logo, composed of a quotation mark in a circle, with the Os in the Vodafone logotype representing opening and closing quotation marks and suggesting conversation.

=== Vodafone AirTouch: 1999 to 2000 ===
On 29 June 1999, Vodafone completed its purchase of American service provider AirTouch and changed its name to Vodafone AirTouch Plc. The merged company commenced trading on 30 June 1999. The acquisition gave Vodafone a 35% share of Mannesmann, owner of the largest German mobile network. To gain antitrust approval for the merger, Vodafone sold its 17.2% stake in Mannesmann&#x27;s German competitor, E-Plus.

On 21 September 1999, Vodafone agreed to merge its US wireless assets with those of Bell Atlantic Corp to form Verizon. The merger was completed on 4 April 2000, just a few months prior to Bell Atlantic&#x27;s merger with GTE to form Verizon Communications.

In November 1999, Vodafone made an unsolicited bid for Mannesmann, which was rejected. Vodafone&#x27;s interest in Mannesmann had been increased by the latter&#x27;s purchase of Orange, the UK mobile operator. Gent would later say Mannesmann&#x27;s move into the UK broke a &quot;gentleman&#x27;s agreement&quot; not to compete in each other&#x27;s home territory. The hostile takeover provoked strong protests in Germany, and a &quot;titanic struggle&quot; which saw Mannesmann resist Vodafone&#x27;s efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the Mannesmann board agreed to an increased offer of £112 billion, then the largest corporate merger ever. The EU approved the merger in April 2000 after Vodafone agreed to divest the &#x27;Orange&#x27; brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by France Télécom.

===Vodafone Group: 2000 to present===


On 28 July 2000, the Company reverted to its former name, Vodafone Group Plc.

On 17 December 2001, Vodafone introduced the concept of &quot;partner networks&quot;, by signing TDC Mobil of Denmark. The new concept involved the introduction of Vodafone international services to the local market, without the need of investment by Vodafone, extending the Vodafone brand and services into markets where it did not have stakes in local operators. Vodafone services would be marketed under the dual-brand scheme, where the Vodafone brand is added at the end of the local brand (i.e., TDC Mobil-Vodafone etc.).

Vodafone sponsored the Premier League team Manchester United F.C. from 2000 until the 2005–06 season. In 2007, Vodafone entered into a title sponsorship deal with the McLaren Formula One team (previously Vodafone sponsored Scuderia Ferrari in 2002 until 2006), which traded as &quot;Vodafone McLaren Mercedes&quot; until the sponsorship ended at the end of the 2013 season.

On 1 December 2011, it acquired the Reading-based Bluefish Communications Ltd, an ICT consultancy company. The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within its subsidiary Vodafone Global Enterprise, which was to focus on implementing strategies in cloud computing, and strengthen its professional services offering.

In April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide (CWW) for £1.04 billion. The acquisition gave Vodafone access to CWW&#x27;s fibre network for businesses, enabling it to offer unified communications to enterprises. On 18 June 2012, Cable &amp; Wireless shareholders voted in favour of the Vodafone offer.

On 2 September 2013, Vodafone announced it would be selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications for $US130 billion. With the proceeds from the deal, it announced a £19 billion Project Spring initiative to improve network quality in Europe and emerging markets, such as India.

In June 2017, the company took measures to prevent its advertising from appearing within outlets focused on creating and sharing hate speech and fake news.

In January 2020, Vodafone confirmed that it has pulled out of Diem Association (known as Libra Association at the time), the governing council for the Facebook-created global digital currency initiative.

In June 2023, it was announced that Vodafone UK would merge with Three UK; Vodafone would own 51% of the combined company, and CK Hutchison Holdings 49%. If approved by regulators, the merger will create a group with 27 million mobile customers. On 3 July 2024, Vodafone and Virgin Media O2 announced to extend their network-sharing deal into the mid-2030s, including a spectrum shift to aid Vodafone&#x27;s $19 billion merger with Three UK, which faced a Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation. The deal, involved selling some of its combined 59% of the best 5G spectrum to Virgin Media O2, aimed to address regulatory concerns about reducing mobile networks from four to three in Britain. Vodafone pledged a £11 billion investment in 5G if the merger was approved, asserting the merger would strengthen competition. In November 2024, the CMA provisionally concluded that the Vodafone and Three Merger could go ahead, if both companies made price promises for consumers and committed to boosting the UK&#x27;s 5G rollout.

In June 2024, Vodafone Group sold an 18% stake in Indian company Indus Towers, raising $1.82 billion to reduce its debt. Initially planning to sell a 10% stake, strong investor demand led Vodafone to nearly double the sale. Bharti Airtel increased its stake in Indus to about 49% by purchasing around 1% of the shares. The sale generated 153 billion rupees and reduced Vodafone&#x27;s stake in Indus from 21.5% to 3.1%.

In November 2024, Vodafone Group announced plans to sell its remaining 3.1% stake in Indus Towers to Bharti Airtel for approximately $166 million (13.8 billion Indian rupees). The sale was part of Vodafone&#x27;s ongoing strategy to simplify its portfolio and focus on core markets. The transaction was expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, subject to regulatory approvals.

In December 2024, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) approved the merger of Vodafone UK and Three UK, forming the country&#x27;s largest mobile network. Despite concerns about potential price hikes, the CMA&#x27;s approval was conditional on significant investments in 5G infrastructure and legally binding commitments to improve services. These included capping mobile tariffs and offering set contractual terms to mobile virtual network operators for three years. The CMA and Ofcom will oversee the implementation of these commitments, ensuring consumer protections are maintained.

The deal valued Vodafone India at the equivalent of $12.6 billion and Idea Cellular at the equivalent of $11.02 billion.

Over the next few years the company grew to become the UK&#x27;s market leader, changing its name to Vodafone Group plc in the process.

Sir Christopher Gent took over as Chief Executive in January 1997, after Sir Gerald&#x27;s retirement. Gent was responsible for transforming Vodafone from a small UK operator into the global operator, through the merger with the American AirTouch and the takeover of Germany&#x27;s Mannesmann.

Arun Sarin was the driving force behind the company&#x27;s move into emerging markets such as Asia and Africa, through the purchases such as that of Turkish operator Telsim, and a majority stake in Hutchison Essar in India.

The fourth CEO, Vittorio Colao, stepped up from Deputy Chief Executive in July 2008.

===Financial results===
Vodafone reports its results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Financial performance has been as follows:

==Criticisms==
===Tax avoidance===
In September 2010, an investigation by &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine revealed certain details of Vodafone&#x27;s tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone routed the acquisition of Mannesmann through a Luxembourg subsidiary, set up to avoid paying tax on the deal, and continued to place its profits in Luxembourg. Following a long legal struggle with HMRC (during which a senior HMRC official, John Connors, switched sides to become head of tax at Vodafone), it was eventually agreed that Vodafone would pay £1.25 billion related to the acquisition. Based on Vodafone&#x27;s accounts, experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £6 billion.

The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010, outside Vodafone shops across the UK, organised under the banner of UK Uncut. The protests caused the closure of various stores across the UK.

In 2011, &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism alleged that Vodafone&#x27;s Swiss branches were run by a single part-time bookkeeper. The report claimed hardly any business was done from there, indicating that the main purpose of the Zug office was tax avoidance. The report claimed the money was borrowed from the Swiss branch of the Luxembourg company, allowing it to take advantage of Luxembourg&#x27;s laws, which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax, and Swiss laws, which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies. According to the expose, this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill of a little over £2 billion. It said Vodafone publishes a single, combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches. For the one company, profits worth £1.6 billion were taxed at less than 1% in 2011, and the profits are likely to have been attributed to Switzerland. In its response to these allegations, Vodafone has said the Swiss branch has not been involved in Vodafone&#x27;s global financing for a number of years. It is, therefore, irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements.

Vodafone was also assessed a US$2.5 billion tax over its acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa&#x27;s Indian assets in 2007, a demand that it contests. In January 2012, the highest Indian court ruled that Vodafone is not liable for taxes and penalties of up to £2.8 billion. However, in February 2016 India&#x27;s tax department sent Vodafone a renewed tax notice of £1.4bn. Following the siding of the Indian court with Vodafone in 2012, the government changed the law to allow firms to be retrospectively taxed. In September 2020, an international arbitration tribunal sided with Vodafone and ruled that India&#x27;s efforts to claim past taxes was in violation of fair treatment under the bilateral investment protection pact between India and the Netherlands. India was asked by the tribunal to stop its efforts to claim the tax dues.

===Communications blackout during the Arab Spring===
Vodafone was implicated in the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in Egypt&#x27;s 2011 demonstrations. On 27 January, Vodafone, responsible for much of Egypt&#x27;s telecommunication infrastructure, shut off all voice and data services for Egyptian citizens and businesses at the request of the Egyptian Government under Hosni Mubarak. On 28 January 2011, Vodafone complied with Egyptian government instructions to suspend Internet service &quot;in selected areas&quot; during a period of anti-Mubarak protests. The company issued a statement that &quot;Under Egyptian legislation, the authorities have the right to issue such an order and we are obliged to comply with it.&quot; Vodafone also received public and media criticism for allowing the authorities to send mass pro-government messages via SMS over their network during the protests. One such message requested that &quot;honest and loyal men&quot; should &quot;confront the traitors and criminals&quot;. Vodafone later issued a statement asserting that they had no choice but to allow the messages to be broadcast, and that they had complained to the Egyptian authorities about the practice. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; of the UK reported, &quot;The Egyptian government&#x27;s action is unprecedented in the history of the internet.&quot; US-based Internet intelligence firm Renesys stated, &quot;in an action unprecedented in Internet history, the Egyptian government appears to have ordered service providers to shut down all international connections to the Internet.&quot; Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao said the company was obliged by law to comply with the instructions of the Egyptian government. At the company&#x27;s annual general meeting, on 26 June, the campaign groups Access and FairPensions asked Vodafone to endorse a plan to prevent the company facing similar demands in the future.

===Poor customer service===
In Australia, particularly towards the end of 2010, Vodafone was heavily criticised due to allegations of poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname &quot;Vodafail&quot; a website of the same name still exists. In response, they have developed a &quot;new&quot; network, and now provide a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.

In 2019, Vodafone was rated as the UK&#x27;s worst mobile network provider for the eighth year in a row, in the eighth annual survey by consumer lobby group &quot;Which?&quot;.

===Unlimited roaming costs on stolen phones===
Vodafone UK, in common with other operators, has been criticised for holding customers on regular monthly billed contracts liable for almost unlimited roaming costs when their phones are stolen abroad, despite being seemingly able to limit costs of pay-as-you-go contracts.

===Breaches of consumer protection rules===
In October 2016, Vodafone was fined a record £4.6m by Ofcom for &quot;serious&quot; breaches of consumer protection rules.

In October 2017, Citizens Advice undertook a mystery shopping exercise which found that Vodafone, along with EE and Three, were not reducing customers&#x27; bills after fixed deals finished which meant that they were paying an extra £22 a month on average.

===Surveillance infrastructure===
In June 2014, Vodafone revealed information about their and other telecommunication operators&#x27; &#x27;direct access systems&#x27;, content data and metadata interception programmes globally.

=== Scam investigation ===
In March 2019, the Indian investigation agency CBI filed a plea in the Supreme Court of India against Vodafone and Airtel alleging non cooperation in the Saradha chitfund scam. The court listed the matter for a hearing on 8 April 2019.

<doc id="468998" wikidata="Q605901" url="?curid=468998" title="Swedish East India Company">
<text>The Swedish East India Company (; SOIC) was founded in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1731 for the purpose of conducting trade with India, China and the Far East. The venture was inspired by the success of the Dutch East India Company and the British East India Company. This made Gothenburg a European Centre of trade in eastern products. The main goods were black pepper, spices, silk, tea, furniture, porcelain, precious stones and other distinctive luxury items. Trade with India and China saw the arrival of some new customs in Sweden. The cultural influence increased, and tea, rice, arrack (a drink made from fermented sap or sugarcane) and new root vegetables started appearing in Swedish homes.

It grew to become the largest trading company in Sweden during the 18th century: a total of 132 expeditions were carried out with 37 different ships. The company folded in 1813; nevertheless, it left clear footprints that can still be seen in Gothenburg.

== Background ==

Sweden was the last of the more prominent seafaring European nations to engage in the East India Trade. The royal privileges for the Swedish East India Company (SOIC) were granted almost a century after the other European trading companies were established.

With the advent of the East India trade in the 17th century, Chinese and Indian goods were imported to Sweden. Drinking tea, wearing Indian Chintz clothes and having Chinese objects became the height of fashion among Swedish socialites and the middle class. Culture, philosophy, art, agriculture, and architecture were also studied and copied. The most prominent example of this is the Chinese Pavilion at Drottningholm, which was followed by smaller parks like the one built by Jean Abraham Grill at Godegård. This culminated during the 18th century, when many Swedish scientists and politicians even suggested that Sweden should be governed by intellectual bureaucrats, &quot;mandarins&quot;, led by a sovereign king in a Chinese manner.

=== Early attempts ===
The first attempt of organizing a Swedish East India trading company was made by a Flemish merchant, Willem Usselincx. During the 17th century, the Dutch merchants dominated the newly founded Gothenburg on the west coast of Sweden. The town was considered ideal for Sweden&#x27;s international trade since most of the goods were transported on ships and this was the only major Swedish port accessible without having to pass the Danish customs at Øresund. On 14June 1626, Usselincx received royal privileges for a trading company for twelve years, from the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf. The privileges included clauses about the ethics of trading with foreign, indigenous people. The first priority was to establish friendly, long-term relations that would be mutually beneficiary for both parties. The venture was supported by a number of prominent Swedes, including the King himself, but raising the necessary money proved harder. Political difficulties and Sweden&#x27;s participation in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, where King Gustav II was killed, put an end to the plans. The resources were instead used for a smaller company, trading within Europe.

The next attempt to start a trading company was made in 1661, by German merchant Erlenkamp, who suggested a route over the Arctic Ocean, the Northern Sea Route, past Japan and further on to China and India. The aim was to bypass the Spanish and Portuguese blockades. The plan did not gain any support as the ice barriers proved even more difficult. At the end of the 1660s, a petition from diplomat and London resident Johan Leijonbergh was sent to the Swedish King Charles XI regarding one Olle Borg who had worked in the Dutch East India Company for eighteen years. Borg stated that if there was a war between Sweden and Denmark, he could deliver the Danish fort in Tharangambadi, India, to the Swedes. Knut Kurck, Peter Schnack and Johan Olivecreutz were appointed directors for the company, but the political unrest in Sweden at that time plus trouble with actually getting the money that had been promised from the investors thwarted this venture as well, and in 1674, the charter was dissolved. Residual resources were used to send two ships, the &quot;Solen&quot; (the Sun) and the &quot;Trumslagaren&quot; (the Drummer), to Lisbon for salt.

A later attempt to establish the Swedish trade on the East Indies was made by pirates sailing out from Madagascar. After having attacked other trading ships, they had become wealthy and were looking for a place to settle down and invest their money in legitimate enterprise. The pirates numbered about 1,500 and commanded a considerable and well-armed fleet of ships. They started by offering the Swedish King Charles XII half a million pounds sterling and 25 armed ships for his protection, but the matter was not resolved. In 1718, representatives for the pirates met again with the King at his camp during the campaign against Norway. The new offer was for 60 ships, armed and stocked with goods, if the pirates were allowed to settle down in Gothenburg and start a trade with the East Indies under the Swedish flag. One privateer by the name of Morgan actually obtained a charter for an East India Company and a letter of appointment for himself as governor over the colonies that could be the result of such an enterprise. When the King was shot and died on 30November 1718, the venture folded.

=== Sweden after the Great Northern War ===

Sweden was impoverished after the Great Northern War, and trade was seen as an option for rebuilding the country. Opinions about whether trade with the East Indies would be profitable enough diverged. The greatest concern was that Sweden would not have enough resources to defend the company&#x27;s ships and trading posts. The trading companies from England, France, and the Netherlands did not hesitate to attack other ships to prevent competition. A failed attempt to start a competing trade company in Austria, the Ostend Company, was discouraging.

What finally made the Swedish venture possible was the strong support from foreign traders and merchants, foremost British but also Dutch, who had been shut out from the companies in their respective countries. The majority of the investors, as well as the buyers of the goods imported by the company, were foreigners.

Granting permission for a charter was not entirely uncontroversial during that time when mercantilism, which advocated regulations so that the production of export goods was promoted and import reduced, was the dominant idea for trade. Opposition became even more apparent after the first journey made by the ship &quot;Friedericus Rex Sueciaes&quot; in 1735. Demands were made in the Riksdag for sanctions and restrictions for the trade company, a number of pamphlets were written, arguing that Swedish steel and timber were wastefully being exchanged for such &quot;worthless goods&quot; as tea and porcelain. One of the most ardent critics against the charter was Johan Arckenholtz. He even spoke of the moral aspects, saying that the Swedish population &quot;would be weaned from work and crafts and lose their health, strength and spirit by using products from a warmer climate&quot;.

The emerging Swedish textile industry was also threatened by the trade, and the new company soon promised to refrain from shipping textiles. Of sixty-one successfully returning voyages between 1733 and 1767, only three (in 1735, 1740, and 1742) carried cotton and silk textiles and raw silk from Bengal. Some opposition may have been rooted in pure jealousy of the profits the SOIC were making from the trade. Those who supported the establishing of a Swedish trade company argued that if people wanted goods from China, they were going to buy them anyway and it would be better to import them using Swedish ships and trading company, and thereby keep the profits within Sweden.

== Establishing the SOIC ==

With the suspension of the charter for the Ostend company by the Emperor Charles VI in May 1727, the investors in that company had to look for other ways to be part of the profitable East India trade and they now looked to Sweden.

Scottish merchant Colin Campbell, formerly active in the Ostend Company, met with Swedish Niclas Sahlgren during Sahlgren&#x27;s stay in Amsterdam in the late 1720s. Together they made plans for a Swedish trading company, but it was evident that Campbell was the driving force in the enterprise. Since foreign investors were met with suspicion in Sweden, they needed a respectable Swede to front the company. That person would be commissioner Henrik König, a Swede of German (Bremen) origin.

In 1729, Henrik König submitted an application for a charter for two ships. He supported his request on the charter given previously to other applicants, but the reaction from the Swedish government was reluctant: the closing of the Ostend Company in 1731, following British diplomatic pressure as part of the Treaty of Vienna, boded ill for the Swedes&#x27; competition against the main powers when trade and politics were so intimately associated. König took the matters to the Swedish parliament and succeeded, gaining royal privileges for the company on 14June 1731, initially for a period of 15 years. These privileges were the First Charter, or the First Octroi.

=== Royal charter ===
The charter was given to Henrik König &amp; Compagnie and consisted of eighteen precise paragraphs on how the trade should be conducted:

#The company would have the right to all trade and shipping east of the Cape of Good Hope as far as Japan excepting the port factories of other European nations, unless free consent had been obtained in advance.
#All departures and arrivals should be out of Gothenburg, and cargo was to be auctioned promptly in Gothenburg on arrival.
#The Swedish state was to receive 100 riksdaler per &quot;läst&quot; (c. 2.5 tonnes) and two riksdaler per &quot;läst&quot; to the city of Gothenburg, on each shipment, plus taxes.
#The company could use as many vessels it wanted, but they were to be built and outfitted in Sweden unless something occurred that made it necessary to buy material from other countries.
#The ships were to fly the Swedish flag and carry Swedish ships&#x27; papers.
#The company was free to use as much money as needed for the expeditions and were entitled to issue shares to finance the venture.
#The company was forbidden from bringing Swedish coined silver into or out of the country. They were, however, allowed to trade with any other kind of silver.
#Once the ships were loaded for departure, and when they returned, they were free to enter any port in Sweden.
#All the equipment, armament goods, and stores needed for the company were exempted from Swedish customs.
#Goods from the ships were considered prioritized, and could be transported or stored toll-free on any road or in any town.
#The company&#x27;s officers would have the same authority as Swedish naval officers.
#The crew were exempted from service in the Swedish military.
#The company&#x27;s officers had the right to arrest and detain anyone in the crew who tried to desert or run away.
#When the cargo from the ships had been sold, the buyers should not have to pay any extra fees for the goods.
#The board of the company should always consist of at least three directors.
#The company was free to employ as many men as needed for the ships. They could be Swedes or foreigners, as long as they were the most skilled.
#The company had the right to defend itself, to &quot;oppose force with force&quot;.
#The company was enjoined to maintain secrecy on its finances and shareholders.
The issuing of shares was such that early subscribers subscribed for each voyage and had the option of withdrawing their capital after its completion, in a traditional form of corporate trading partnerships; in 1753, this having been found inconvenient, it was determined that capital should be considered invested in the company as a whole, on the model of other East India companies. A partner desiring to withdraw his funds was responsible for finding another willing to substitute capital of his own.

The reasons for secrecy on finances and shareholders were both internal and external: British citizens were forbidden to engage in trade in Asia on behalf of the Swedish East India Company and within Sweden suspicions ran high against foreigners, as they were thought to threaten the Swedish profits in the region. Jealousy from merchants not in the company also played a part. Thus, the books were burned after they had been closed and revised, effectively concealing the company&#x27;s dealings from contemporaries and historians.

The letter of privilege was translated into French and Latin and distributed to the major powers. Their reaction was reluctant and they made clear that they considered the new company a most unwelcome competitor. The Swedish ambassador to Britain did not dare to present the letter to the British government. Pledges of assistance at their bases if needed were not answered. France and the Netherlands declared that they saw Sweden as a competitor and they would not contribute to or assist in such a venture.

== Trade ==
After having been ruled by a number of autocratic and ambitious kings, Sweden was, at the forming of the SOIC, practically run without the participation of the king. The real political power lay with the Riksdag of the Estates where the first two political parties, the Hats and the Caps, competed for power. The king did not even have to attend the meetings of the Riksdag; he had been substituted with his name stamp. The king, or prince consort, at that time was Frederick I, considered the most incompetent king of Sweden by many contemporary politicians and later historians. His only interests were hunting and women; the king&#x27;s absence gave the Riksdag and the bureaucrats a free rein to promote trade and science.

During its entire existence from 1731 to 1813, the SOIC made 131 voyages, using 37 different ships. Of these, eight ships were lost, totally or partially. The sorest loss was probably the &quot;Götheborg&quot; in 1745, as it sank just off Älvsborg fortress at the entrance to Gothenburg having managed to journey safely to China and back. Even though most books were burned, it is evident that the voyages were extremely profitable for the shareholders, and many Swedes became wealthy due to the SOIC.

From Gothenburg the vessels carried iron, both in bars and processed, as axes, anchors, steel, etc. Copper was also brought, as was timber. The expeditions called at Cádiz where they traded goods to acquire essential Spanish silver, on which the China trade depended in the form of coins, pesos duros, since the charter stated that the silver carried to China, coined or uncoined, could not be Swedish. The company also had to pay tax to the Dey of Algiers and carry Moroccan passports, thereby being ensured protection from raids by Barbary pirates. These transactions are documented in receipts.

The return on expeditions could be around 25–30% of the capital invested, but up to 60% was achieved. Much depended on the merchants and the captain; the merchants had to close numerous favourable deals, and the captain had the difficult task of safely sailing the ship to China and back. The vessels were around long, and in addition to cargo and men, each ship also carried about 25–30 cannons for self-defence and signaling. In most years of the period after 1766 one or two SOIC ships were loaded at Canton, or as many a four (1785–86). The last vessel returned to Gothenburg in March 1806, and even though the company had charters until 1821, it ceased to exist in 1813.

Life onboard the ships was hard and hazardous, the crew was malnourished and not used to the heat and humidity in the ports they visited during the journey. In addition to this, the doctors on board were completely helpless when it came to dealing with fevers and tropical illnesses. It is estimated that about 2,000 men died in the service of the company.

=== First octroi (1731–1746) ===

The first three directors of the SOIC was Henrik König, Colin Campbell and Frans Bedoire. König was a merchant from Stockholm. Bedoir was the son of a French wigmaker who had relocated to Sweden to import French wine. Campbell was the driving force for the whole enterprise since he had gained firsthand knowledge of the China trade as supercargo for the Ostend Company. He was knighted by King Frederick I and moved to Gothenburg to organize the first expedition.

The first two expeditions proved dangerous and complicated since the rest of the trading nations did not take kindly to Sweden&#x27;s attempt to engage in the trade. The first ship was seized by the Dutch and the second was destroyed by the British and the French. This fueled the opposition against the trade in Sweden and the SOIC started a massive PR-campaign about the benefits of trading with the East Indies. They also agreed to make certain concessions about what goods to import from China. To avoid confrontations with the other trading countries, the company refrained from seeking trade with India and focused on China instead.

A total of 15 expeditions supported by 25 ships were launched during the first charter. Four of the ships were lost at sea. Only three of these expeditions went to Bengal; the rest sailed directly to Canton.

Books and accounts from the first expeditions are missing, partially or completely, but starting with the eighth expedition (the ships &quot;Fredericus Rex Sueciae&quot;, &quot;Stockholm&quot; and &quot;Riddarhuset&quot; in 1740) until the closing of the last in 1748, records were so complete that an estimate of the profits could be made for these. The total sum of the income from the imported goods was 24.649 million riksdaler (approx. US$1,222.6 million), making the dividend about 39% in average. During those years the share of the profit for the five directors totaled 550,000 riksdaler (approx. US$27.28 million) and the total sum that went to the 53 supercargoes was about 800,000 riksdaler (approx. US$39.67 million).

The unwillingness of the established trading nations, primarily Britain, the Dutch Republic and France, to help and acknowledge the SOIC during the first years were founded on the suspicion that the company was merely a front for those merchants who wished to circumvent the rules and regulations of the East India trade in their own countries. These suspicions were well founded. All of the initiators of the SOIC were non-Swedes or of foreign descent. Swedish law made it possible for anyone who invested in the company to receive Swedish citizenship and most of the crew aboard the ships during the first and the second octroi were foreigners. Of the 53 supercargoes during the first octroi, about 22 percent were Swedes.

==== First expedition ====

The first expedition was organized by Campbell. His reconstructed diary of the voyage, rediscovered in 1986, contains a complete account of the expedition. It started on 9February 1732, as the ship &quot;Friedericus Rex Sueciae&quot; sailed out from Gothenburg. Campbell was the first supercargo onboard and had also been appointed ambassador to the Chinese court by the King. The other three supercargos were English: Charles Graham, Charles Morford and John Pike. The captain of the &quot;Fredericus&quot; was Georg Herman af Trolle, a seasoned sailor who had been brought up in Amsterdam and previously served on British, French, Dutch and Danish ships. He had also been employed as a privateer by the town of Middelburg. Both he and Campbell had previously visited China. The crew for the ship was approximately one hundred men.

The expedition started well – passing the Cape of Good Hope and crossing the Indian Ocean, the vessel arrived safely in Canton (now known as Guangzhou), the trading port for foreigners in China at that time, in September 1732. For the next four months, trading was carried out successfully. Initially, different spices were the primary commodity along with tea, silk and miscellaneous luxury items, but on later voyages, porcelain and tea made up the bulk of the trade to meet the demand for such goods back in Europe.

On its return, the vessel was stopped by the Dutch between Java and Sumatra, and brought to Batavia. Campbell protested and produced his papers, but the Dutch argued that they had suspected the vessel of falsely flying the Swedish flag. The expedition was eventually released, but time was lost and the winds unfavourable. Many of the seamen died en route and the ship had to recruit new Norwegian sailors upon reaching the coast of Norway.

Almost one and a half years after the departure, the vessel returned to Gothenburg on 27August 1733. The expedition was a huge economic success, the auction bringing in some 900,000 Swedish riksdaler. The dividend paid was 75% of the capital invested. According to the ledgers of the Gothenburg Main Customs Cambers for Sea Trade in 1733 to 1734, goods for 518,972 riksdaler were exported; the rest stayed in Sweden.

=== Second octroi (1746–1766) ===

The charter was renewed in 1746, 1766 and 1786, creating the Second, Third and Fourth Octrois.

Under the terms of the second charter 36 ships were sent out, three to Surat, the rest to Canton, and only one was lost.

The profit for the shareholders during the first charter generated large interest for a second charter. Except for the foreign investors, most of the merchants during the first charter had been from Gothenburg. With the second charter, a number of merchants from Stockholm started to show interest in the trade. On 23September 1745, a request for a second octroi was presented by the firm &quot;Abraham and Jacob Arfwedsson &amp; Co&quot;. They received a preliminary grant for it. A couple of weeks later, a second request for an octroi was made by the company &quot;Anders Plomgren &amp; C:o&quot; and partner Carl Broman. The directors from the first charter submitted their request on 20January 1746.

A commission to investigate the applications was appointed on 24March 1746, and some weeks later on 14May, they concluded that the directors from the first charter were best suited to lead the second as well. However, the number of directors was increased from three to at least seven. In addition to Colin Campbell, Niclas Sahlgren and Teodor Ankarcrona, the directors were former secretary of the Executive Board Magnus Lagerström, the Stockholm merchants Anders Plomgren and Abraham Grill. These six members of the board later elected Claes Grill, Jacob von Utfall Jeanson, S. N. Wenngren and Nils Ström as directors.

The second charter was for 20 years and the directors followed the ways of the first octroi. They collected the means from the investors to fund each of the first 14 ships separately. In 1753, the company was reorganized into a joint-stock company by creating a fixed fund where anyone could subscribe for shares, but not for less than 500 riksdaler in silver.

Even after the company went public, it still retained its secrecy regarding the business. The management deliberately withheld information from the shareholders or lied about how profitable parts of the business were. The directors said that the profit from the trade with China was declining and that the company should be granted permission to send a ship to India, contrary to the regulations for the trade so far. An exemption was granted in 1749, and a ship was sent to Surat in India. On its return in 1752, that ship yielded a profit of 103% and two more ships were sent to Surat. The British and Dutch controlled most of the trade in the town and did everything to prevent the Swedes from doing business there and several incidents occurred. The company decided to refocus in the China trade instead. That trade yielded an average profit of 30–40% during the second charter.

=== Third octroi (1766–1786) ===

When it was time to renew the charter in 1766, the first directors were Robert Finlay of Irish and Scottish origin, Swedish Fabian Löwen and Georg Herman Conradi of German descent, all residing in Stockholm. With this the power within the management shifted from Gothenburg to Stockholm, where two new ships also were bought. The Swedish government extorted a loan at 6% interest to the SOIC to be paid during 1766–69, estimated in 1813 to have been the equivalent of £100,000, and another, interest-free, for half of that sum, to be repaid out of import duties, in essence an advance payment of duty.

During the third charter, 39 voyages were made to Canton and none of the ships was lost or damaged, but the profit from the trade with China was declining. The turning point for Sweden came in 1780 during the American Revolutionary War, when France, the Dutch Republic and Spain declared war on Britain and were subsequently unable to trade with China. The price of tea fell in Canton due to the lack of demand, but went up in Europe where Sweden was now practically the only supplier of tea. This was reflected in the total sum of the profit for the third octroi, which was 58% higher than the previous two.

The goods that were exported from Sweden also changed during that period. The former main products such as iron, wood and tar are missing from the freight lists. Instead the biggest item was silver, followed by English lead and Swedish woollen cloth or broadcloth. During the later part of the third charter, it became common practice for one of the supercargoes to stay on permanently in Canton for years. One of those was Jean Abraham Grill, who made ample use of his time there for his own private affairs, a practice that was continued by other resident supercargoes. Carl Linnaeus and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences also made use of the company&#x27;s ships. They sent out scientists and researchers to gather information about animals and plants from all the places that the ships visited and to keep detailed journals. The company would not allow idle passengers on board, so most of the scientists were given &quot;crash courses&quot; in theology and were hastily ordained to serve as ship&#x27;s chaplains. These arrangements started during the second charter and peaked during the third.

In 1758, the Swedes were finally able to let their ships anchor and replenish provisions at the Cape (now known as Cape Town), a port controlled by the Dutch, due to political changes in Europe. But with the end of the American war in 1783, Sweden lost its advantage in the tea trade and the decline of the company resumed. The SOIC&#x27;s supercargo in Canton in 1777, Peter Johan Bladh, reflected on this and suggested that an emissary should be sent to the emperor of China with a proposition that the European trade with China should be conducted through one single European company, administered by Sweden. Bladh argued that unless efforts were taken to oppose them the British would dominate European trade with China the same way they had done in India by &quot;securing an unbearable domination&quot; there. The request was never sent since the directors wanted to continue the trade in the same way as before.

The mercantile expansion of the SOIC during the third octroi provided a setting for Jacob Wallenberg&#x27;s comic &quot;Min son på galejan&quot; (&quot;My Son on the Galley&quot;) written during the 18-month round trip to Canton in 1769–71. Among his other joking and casual racism, Wallenberg parodies the serious accounts published by traveling naturalists in the wide web of Carl Linnaeus&#x27; correspondence.

=== Fourth octroi (1786–1806) ===
The SOIC continued into the fourth charter, much the same company that had existed during the last part of the third. The management was the same, a fixed fund existed and some of the fees, taxes and regulations were altered. During this octroi, the company owned 12 ships that were sent out on a total of 31 journeys. Three of the ships were lost and one was damaged and sold. The shareholders received no dividend during the fourth octroi.

The profit from the trade continued to decline, much because of the new rules and regulations regarding the import of tea to England. Most of the SOIC&#x27;s earlier tea cargoes had been smuggled to England, but the profit no longer made up for the risk of such an undertaking. Talk of shutting down the company started in 1789, and after 1804, no more ships were sent out from Sweden. On 27June 1808, the company informed the shareholders of the situation and on 18May 1811, the company of the fourth charter was declared bankrupt.

=== Decline and fall ===
There was a fifth octroi, starting in 1806 with privileges granted for 15 years, but those were quite different from the previous. Now anyone had the right to trade with the countries on the other side of Cape if the SOIC had not started the trade by launching a ship within two years. With the investors&#x27; faith in the trade now broken, no ships were sent out and at a shareholders meeting on 13December 1813, the company folded, eight years before the octroi ended. The remaining stock and inventory was sold to foreign buyers and in 1814, the trade was declared free for anyone.

== Cargo ==

The main valuable cargo from China was tea. In an overview from 1774, its share was about 90%. Much of the tea was re-exported and smuggled into England, undercutting the prices of that country&#x27;s own trade monopoly held by the East India Company. Porcelain was also important, accounting for about 5% of the cargo&#x27;s value. Over the years it is estimated that some 50 million pieces of porcelain were imported by the SOIC. The spirit arrack, a new commodity for Sweden, was also considered valuable.

A cargo tally, printed by William Milburn in 1813, shows the following.

Chests of tea:
* Bohea, in 2885 chests
* Congou ()
* Souchong ()
* Pekoe ()
* Hyson and &quot;Hyson Skin&quot; (together )
Textiles:
* Damasks and heavier damasks for furniture
* Satin silk, some of it &quot;coloured and flowered&quot;
* Paduasoy
* Grogram also known as &quot;gorgoron&quot;
* Taffetas,
* Lampas
* Nankeen cloth
* 33 chests of raw silk

Drugs:
* Galangal root
* China root
* Sago
* Rhubarb
Miscellaneous:
* Mother-of-pearl, some of it cut in thin jetons
* Thin canes for hoops
* Painted wallpapers
* Lacquered (japanned) quadrille boxes
* Dressing tables
* Tablets for table tops
* Arrack (used in Swedish punsch), 
* Porcelain, in 274 chests and 989 barrels and other packages

== Flag ==

According to the first charter, the SOIC&#x27;s ships were only allowed to use the Swedish merchant flag, a rectangular blue flag with a yellow cross. With the renewal of the charter in 1746, the company was allowed to add its name cypher, or monogram, to the flag in order to distinguish the ships from other trading vessels. Soon after that, the ships of the SOIC started to use a fork-tailed or swallow-tailed flag. The intention was that the ship should resemble a warship and thereby not attract pirates. Swedish warships, or ships carrying a military commander, used the Swedish ensign a triple-tailed or swallowtail and tongue version of the rectangular flag. This was against the rules and regulations for flags at that time. The use of the swallowtail was prohibited in a royal decree in 1751, but the SOIC ignored this and ordered their flags in Canton instead. The swallowtails were even used in the bow of the ships&#x27; sloops when they carried a director of the company. This was a double felony, since flags should only be used at the stern of the sloop.

The prohibition did not bother the executives in the SOIC, and the oldest preserved flag in Sweden is a swallowtail from the ship &quot;Lovisa Ulrica&quot; (to Canton 1767–68). A similar flag, ordered by SOIC director Claes Grill, is kept at Svindersvik.

There were no standardized signal flags at that time; instead, the ships used different, prearranged ways of flying the flag, or flags, sometimes combined with pennants and cannon shots, as signals. Some of these signals were just for the individual ships and some were used internationally. Sometimes this even included showing flags of other nationalities. Those flags were also used as deception if the ship was where hostile ships could be encountered and the captain wanted to avoid confrontation. There are records of ships from the SOIC approaching land under French or English flag, to collect or buy food in places where Swedish ships were forbidden to anchor.

== Modern Swedish East India Company ==

On 28December 1993, a new company called the (the Swedish East India Company Limited) was registered. It was formed to build the replica of the &quot;Götheborg&quot;. The company is registered for shipbuilding, education, research, advertising and marketing in relation to Swedish shipping and international trade. The company is located in Gothenburg. In 2013, the company&#x27;s turnover was 19 million crowns. The company is a subsidiary of the (the East Indiaman Götheborg Foundation) registered in 2008.

=== Company ship replica ===
In 1993 a project to recreate the East Indiaman &quot;Götheborg&quot; and sail her from Gothenburg to Guangzhou began. The project is run by a firm that uses the same name as the original company. The vessel was reconstructed and sailed for China in October 2005, arriving in July 2006, with a mixed crew of professionals and students. The ship has since travelled to many locations and maritime events across the world.

The actual name of the replica is &quot;Götheborg III&quot;. It is a replica of the &quot;Götheborg&quot; that sank outside Gothenburg in 1745. A second ship with the same name was built in Gothenburg in 1786. It was the second largest, (the largest being the &quot;Drottningen&quot;), of all the SOIC vessels and made three journeys to Canton: 2February 1788 – 13May 1790, 13November 1791 – 12June 1793, and on 5December 1795, the ship sailed for Canton but was lost at Cape Town on 8March 1796, on the way out from Gothenburg.

<doc id="469001" wikidata="Q6849101" url="?curid=469001" title="Mike Tuffrey">
<text>Michael William Tuffrey is a British businessman and former Liberal Democrat politician who served as a member of the London Assembly (AM) from 2002 to 2012. He took his seat on 18 February 2002 replacing Louise Bloom who had resigned. He was re-elected in 2004 and 2008 leading the Liberal Democrat group and chairing various London Assembly committees.

==Early life and education==
Tuffrey was born in Orpington and grew up in Bromley. He was educated at Douai School, an independent Catholic school in Woolhampton. He then studied economics at Durham University. (1978–81) He moved to Brixton when he got his first job as a trainee accountant at Peat Marwick, later KPMG.

== Political career ==
He started his political life as a member of the Greater London Council for Vauxhall (1985-6) and was a councillor of the London Borough of Lambeth from 1990 to 2002 during the second half of which period the council had no overall political control and the Liberal Democrats were the largest single party. During this time he represented Lambeth at London Councils and served as a board member of London Development Partnership, Business Link London, Brixton City Challenge, Cross River Partnership and Central London Partnership.

He stood for election to parliament for Streatham in 1987, in the 1989 Vauxhall by-election and again in Vauxhall in the 1992 General Election.

== London Assembly ==
Michael Tuffrey was a member of the London Assembly from 2002 to 2012 and led the Liberal Democrat group from May 2006 until May 2012 [7]. He was a member of the Assembly&#x27;s Environment, Planning and Housing, and Budget and Performance Management Committees.

He was also a member of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, first appointed in 2002 and serving as leader of the Liberal Democrat Group 2006 to 2008. Tuffrey was appointed to the London Sustainable Development Commission in 2004 by Ken Livingstone and reappointed by Boris Johnson for a second term in 2008

==London Mayoral campaign==

After setting out a plan for London Tuffrey launched his bid to become the Liberal Democrat candidate for Mayor of London in the 2012 election. Running against Lembit Öpik, Tuffrey was &quot;widely tipped to become the Liberal Democrats&#x27; candidate&quot;. He emerged after nominations were reopened as the &quot;anyone-but-Lembit&quot; candidate, with Öpik&#x27;s detractors claiming that he &#x27;lacked gravitas&#x27; . However, in the event Tuffrey was narrowly beaten by former Metropolitan Police officer Brian Paddick.

== Professional career ==
Tuffrey is a qualified Chartered Accountant, and has worked as a finance director for a major national charity before starting up a consultancy business, Corporate Citizenship. In 2021 the business was acquired by SLR, an environmental consulting firm. He is also a non-executive director, and chairs the boards of the London Film Academy and the Restart Project. He has contributed to the Guardian on business matters.

== Personal life ==
Tuffrey has lived in Lambeth since 1982 and is married to Irene Tuffrey-Wijne, Professor of Intellectual Disability and Palliative Care.

<doc id="469008" wikidata="Q1561771" url="?curid=469008" title="United States Treasury security">
<text>United States Treasury securities, also called Treasuries or Treasurys, are government debt instruments issued by the United States Department of the Treasury to finance government spending, in addition to taxation. Since 2012, the U.S. government debt has been managed by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, succeeding the Bureau of the Public Debt.

There are four types of marketable Treasury securities: Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). The government sells these securities in auctions conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, after which they can be traded in secondary markets. Non-marketable securities include savings bonds, issued to individuals; the State and Local Government Series (SLGS), purchaseable only with the proceeds of state and municipal bond sales; and the Government Account Series, purchased by units of the federal government.

Treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, meaning that the government promises to raise money by any legally available means to repay them. Although the United States is a sovereign power and may default without recourse, its strong record of repayment has given Treasury securities a reputation as one of the world&#x27;s lowest-risk investments. This low risk gives Treasuries a unique place in the financial system, where they are used as cash equivalents by institutions, corporations, and wealthy investors.

==History==
To finance the costs of World War I, the U.S. Government increased income taxes (see the War Revenue Act of 1917) and issued government debt, called war bonds. Traditionally, the government borrowed from other countries, but there were no other countries from which to borrow in 1917.

The Treasury raised funding throughout the war by selling $21.5 billion in &#x27;Liberty bonds.&#x27; These bonds were sold at subscription, where officials created coupon price and then sold it at par value. At this price, subscriptions could be filled in as little as one day, but usually remained open for several weeks, depending on demand for the bond.

After the war, the Liberty bonds were reaching maturity, but the Treasury was unable to pay each down fully with only limited budget surpluses. To solve this problem, the Treasury refinanced the debt with variable short and medium-term maturities. Again, the Treasury issued debt through fixed-price subscription, where both the coupon and the price of the debt were dictated by the Treasury.

The problems with debt issuance became apparent in the late 1920s. The system suffered from chronic over-subscription, where interest rates were so attractive that there were more purchasers of debt than required by the government. This indicated that the government was paying too much for debt. As government debt was undervalued, debt purchasers could buy from the government and immediately sell to another market participant at a higher price.

In 1929, the US Treasury shifted from the fixed-price subscription system to a system of auctioning where Treasury bills would be sold to the highest bidder. Securities were then issued on a pro rata system where securities would be allocated to the highest bidder until their demand was full. If more treasuries were supplied by the government, they would then be allocated to the next highest bidder. This system allowed the market, rather than the government, to set the price. On December 10, 1929, the Treasury issued its first auction. The result was the issuing of $224 million three-month bills. The highest bid was at 99.310, with the lowest bid accepted at 99.152.

Until the 1970s, the Treasury offered long-term securities at irregular intervals based on market surveys. These irregular offerings created uncertainty in the money market, especially as the federal deficit increased, and by the end of the decade, the Treasury had shifted to regular and predictable offerings. During the same period, the Treasury began to offer notes and bonds through an auction process based on that used for bills.

==Marketable securities==

The types and procedures for marketable security issues are described in the Treasury&#x27;s Uniform Offering Circular (31 CFR 356).

===Treasury bill===
&quot;Treasury bills&quot; (&quot;T-bills&quot;) are zero-coupon bonds that mature in one year or less. They are bought at a discount of the par value and, instead of paying a coupon interest, are eventually redeemed at that par value to create a positive yield to maturity.

Regular T-bills are commonly issued with maturity dates of 4, 8, 13, 17, 26 and 52 weeks, each of these approximating a different number of months. Treasury bills are sold by single-price auctions held weekly. Offering amounts for 13-week and 26-week bills are announced each Thursday for auction on the following Monday and settlement, or issuance, on Thursday. Offering amounts for 4-week and 8-week bills are announced on Monday for auction the next day, Tuesday, and issuance on Thursday. Offering amounts for 52-week bills are announced every fourth Thursday for auction the next Tuesday, and issuance on the following Thursday. The minimum purchase is $100; it had been $1,000 prior to April 2008. Mature T-bills are also redeemed on each Thursday. Banks and financial institutions, especially primary dealers, are the largest purchasers of T-bills.

Like other securities, individual issues of T-bills are identified with a unique CUSIP number. The 13-week bill issued three months after a 26-week bill is considered a re-opening of the 26-week bill and is given the same CUSIP number. The 4-week bill issued two months after that and maturing on the same day is also considered a re-opening of the 26-week bill and shares the same CUSIP number. For example, the 26-week bill issued on March 22, 2007, and maturing on September 20, 2007, has the same CUSIP number (912795A27) as the 13-week bill issued on June 21, 2007, and maturing on September 20, 2007, and as the 4-week bill issued on August 23, 2007, that matures on September 20, 2007.

During periods when Treasury cash balances are particularly low, the Treasury may sell &quot;cash management bills&quot; (&quot;CMBs&quot;). These are sold through a discount auction process like regular bills, but are irregular in the amount offered, the timing, and the maturity term. CMBs are referred to as &quot;on-cycle&quot; when they mature on the same day as a regular bill issue, and &quot;off-cycle&quot; otherwise. Before the introduction of the four-week bill in 2001, the Treasury sold CMBs routinely to ensure short-term cash availability. Since then CMB auctions have been infrequent except when the Treasury has extraordinary cash needs.

Treasury bills are quoted for purchase and sale in the secondary market on an annualized discount percentage, or basis. General calculation for the discount yield for Treasury bills is:

: formula_1

===Treasury note===
&quot;Treasury notes&quot; (&quot;T-notes&quot;) have maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years, have a coupon payment every six months, and are sold in increments of $100. T-note prices are quoted on the secondary market as a percentage of the par value in thirty-seconds of a dollar. Ordinary Treasury notes pay a fixed interest rate that is set at auction. Current yields on the 10-year Treasury note are widely followed by investors and the public to monitor the performance of the U.S. government bond market and as a proxy for investor expectations of longer-term macroeconomic conditions.

Another type of Treasury note, known as the floating rate note, pays interest quarterly based on rates set in periodic auctions of 13-week Treasury bills. As with a conventional fixed-rate instrument, holders are paid the par value of the note when it matures at the end of the two-year term.

===Treasury bond===

&quot;Treasury bonds&quot; (&quot;T-bonds&quot;, also called a &quot;long bond&quot;) have the longest maturity at twenty or thirty years. They have a coupon payment every six months like T-notes.

The U.S. federal government suspended issuing 30-year Treasury bonds for four years from February 18, 2002, to February 9, 2006. As the U.S. government used budget surpluses to pay down federal debt in the late 1990s, the 10-year Treasury note began to replace the 30-year Treasury bond as the general, most-followed metric of the U.S. bond market. However, because of demand from pension funds and large, long-term institutional investors, along with a need to diversify the Treasury&#x27;s liabilities—and also because the flatter yield curve meant that the opportunity cost of selling long-dated debt had dropped—the 30-year Treasury bond was re-introduced in February 2006 and is now issued quarterly. In 2019, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the Trump administration was considering issuance of 50-year and even 100-year Treasury bonds, a suggestion which did not materialize.

===TIPS===
&quot;Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities&quot; (&quot;TIPS&quot;) are inflation-indexed bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. Introduced in 1997, they are currently offered in 5-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities. The coupon rate is fixed at the time of issuance, but the principal is adjusted periodically based on changes in the consumer price index (CPI), the most commonly used measure of inflation. When the CPI rises, the principal is adjusted upward; if the index falls, the principal is adjusted downwards. The adjustments to the principal increase interest income when the CPI rises, thus protecting the holder&#x27;s purchasing power. This &quot;virtually guarantees&quot; a real return over and above the rate of inflation, according to finance scholar Dr. Annette Thau.

Finance scholars Martinelli, Priaulet and Priaulet state that inflation-indexed securities in general (including those used in the United Kingdom and France) provide efficient instruments to diversify portfolios and manage risk because they have a weak correlation with stocks, fixed-coupon bonds and cash equivalents.

A 2014 study found that conventional U.S. Treasury bonds were persistently mispriced relative to TIPS, creating arbitrage opportunities and posing &quot;a major puzzle to classical asset pricing theory.&quot;

===Coupon stripping===
The secondary market for securities includes T-notes, T-bonds, and TIPS whose interest and principal portions of the security have been separated, or &quot;stripped&quot;, in order to sell them separately. The practice derives from the days before computerization, when treasury securities were issued as paper bearer bonds; traders would literally separate the interest coupons from paper securities for separate resale, while the principal would be resold as a zero-coupon bond.

The modern versions are known as Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities (STRIPS). The Treasury does not directly issue STRIPS – they are products of investment banks or brokerage firms – but it does register STRIPS in its book-entry system. STRIPS must be purchased through a broker, and cannot be purchased from TreasuryDirect.

==Nonmarketable securities==

===U.S. savings bonds===

Savings bonds were created in 1935, and, in the form of Series E bonds, also known as war bonds, were widely sold to finance World War II. Unlike Treasury Bonds, they are not marketable, being redeemable only by the original purchaser (or beneficiary in case of death). They remained popular after the end of WWII, often used for personal savings and given as gifts. In 2002, the Treasury Department started changing the savings bond program by lowering interest rates and closing its marketing offices. As of January 1, 2012, financial institutions no longer sell paper savings bonds.

Savings bonds are currently offered in two forms, Series EE and Series I bonds. Series EE bonds pay a fixed rate but are guaranteed to pay at least double the purchase price when they reach initial maturity at 20 years; if the compounded interest has not resulted in a doubling of the initial purchase amount, the Treasury makes a one-time adjustment at 20 years to make up the difference. They continue to pay interest until 30 years.

Series I bonds have a variable interest rate that consists of two components. The first is a fixed rate which will remain constant over the life of the bond; the second component is a variable rate reset every six months from the time the bond is purchased based on the current inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers (CPI-U) from a six-month period ending one month prior to the reset time. New rates are published on May 1 and November 1 of every year. During times of deflation the negative inflation rate can wipe out the return of the fixed portion, but the combined rate cannot go below 0% and the bond will not lose value. Series I bonds are the only ones offered as paper bonds since 2011, and those may only be purchased by using a portion of a federal income tax refund.

===Zero-Percent Certificate of Indebtedness===
The &quot;Certificate of Indebtedness&quot; (C of I) is issued only through the TreasuryDirect system. It is an automatically renewed security with one-day maturity that can be purchased in any amount up to $1000, and does not earn interest. An investor can use Certificates of Indebtedness to save funds in a TreasuryDirect account for the purchase of an interest-bearing security.

===Government Account Series===
The Government Account Series is the principal form of intragovernmental debt holdings. The government issues GAS securities to federal departments and federally-established entities like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that have excess cash.

===State and Local Government Series===
The State and Local Government Series (SLGS) is issued to government entities below the federal level which have excess cash that was obtained through the sale of tax-exempt bonds. The federal tax code generally forbids investment of this cash in securities that offer a higher yield than the original bond, but SLGS securities are exempt from this restriction. The Treasury issues SLGS securities at its discretion and has suspended sales on several occasions to adhere to the federal debt ceiling.

==Holdings==
===Domestic===
In June 2024 approximately $27 trillion of outstanding Treasury securities, representing 78% of the public debt, belonged to domestic holders. Of this amount $7.1 trillion or 21% of the debt was held by agencies of the federal government itself. These intragovernmental holdings function as time deposits of the agencies&#x27; excess and reserve funds to the Treasury. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was also a significant holder as the market agent of the Federal Reserve system, with $4.8 trillion or roughly 14%. Other holders included mutual funds ($3.8 trillion), state and local governments ($2.1 trillion), banks ($1.7 trillion), insurers ($550 billion) and private pension funds ($460 billion) and assorted private entities and individuals ($6 trillion, including $160 billion in Savings Bonds.

===International===

As of June 30, 2023, the top foreign holders of U.S. Treasury securities are:

<doc id="469014" wikidata="Q1394767" url="?curid=469014" title="Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel">
<text>Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel (; born 9 May 1945) is an Iranian conservative and principlist politician and former chairman of the Parliament. He is currently member of the Expediency Discernment Council.

He was the first non-cleric in the post since the Iranian Revolution of 1979. He was one of the candidates in the 2013 presidential election but withdrew on 10 June, four days before the election. He is part of &quot;neo-principilist&quot; group in the Iranian political scene.

==Early life and education==
Haddad-Adel was born in Tehran on 9 May 1945 into a business family. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics from the University of Tehran and also, a master&#x27;s degree in physics from University of Shiraz. He also holds a PhD in philosophy from the University of Tehran which he received in 1975.

He studied Islamic philosophy under Morteza Motahhari and also under Sayyed Hossein Nasr who is famous for his critique of Marxism.

==Career==
Following the Iranian Revolution Haddad-Adel became a member of the Islamic Republic Party and he served in many governmental posts, including deputy culture and Islamic guidance minister (1979) and deputy education minister (1982–1993). Since 1995 he has been serving as the head of the Iranian Academy of Persian Language and Literature (except for August 2004 – 2008). He is also the executive director of the Islamic Encyclopedia Foundation. He contributed to the establishment of the national Scientific Olympiads in Iran.

Haddad-Adel served at the Majlis for thirteen years, over four terms. He officially ranked as the 33rd candidate of Tehran in the 2000 parliamentary election after recounts by the Council of Guardians which led to an annulment of 700,000 Tehrani votes and the removal of Alireza Rajaei and Ali Akbar Rahmani from the top 30, and the withdrawal of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Haddad-Adel collected the most votes from Tehran four years later, while most Tehranis refused to vote in 2004 election because many reformist candidates where not allowed to run. He was supported by the Abadgaran alliance and became the Speaker of Parliament for one year beginning 6 June 2004, with 226 votes out of 259, running unopposed. He became the first non-clerical speaker since the revolution. Since 2008, he has been the advisor to the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. In 2012, he ran for the Majlis speakership, but lost the bid.

He is also a member of the High Council of Cultural Revolution and the Expediency Discernment Council.

===Speaker of Parliament===
As the speaker of Parliament, he condemned the bombing of Samarra. He added that Islamic countries must promote solidarity through guaranteeing unity and security against common enemies. He is the first senior Iranian parliamentary official to hold negotiations with both his counterpart in Cairo and President Mubarak after the Islamic revolution.

===Presidential candidacy===

Haddad-Adel run for office in the presidential election held in July 2013. He formed a coalition named &quot;2+1&quot; with Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and Ali Akbar Velayati in October 2012 to one of them be the coalition&#x27;s candidate in the upcoming election. He was registered as a presidential candidate and was approved to run in the election by the Guardian Council, a vetting body of clerics and jurists, along with seven other men. 
He withdrew his candidacy from 14 June presidential election on 11 June. He said in a statement carried by the semi-official Mehr news agency:&quot;With my withdrawal I ask the dear people to strictly observe the criteria of the Supreme Leader of the Revolution (Khamenei) when they vote for candidates.&quot;

He did not endorse a single candidate, but called for a hardline conservative victory. &quot;I advise the dear people to take a correct decision so that either a conservative wins in the first round, or if the election runs to a second round, the competition between two conservatives.&quot;

==President of Academy of Persian Language and Literature==
Haddad-Adel is also the second president of the Academy of Persian Language and Literature. His presidency at the academy has focused on language policy and planning, and promotion of the Persian language in all domains.

==Electoral history==

==Affiliation==
Haddad-Adel is a senior member in the conservative umbrella organizations Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran, as well as the Popular Front of Islamic Revolution Forces (JAMNA) and is considered close to the Society of Devotees of the Islamic Revolution and the Society of Pathseekers of the Islamic Revolution.

==Public image==
According to a poll conducted in March 2016 by &quot;Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC&quot; (iPOS) among Iranian citizens, Haddad-Adel has 51% approval and 27% disapproval ratings and thus a +24% net popularity; while 13% of responders don&#x27;t know him.

==Views==
One of Haddad-Adel&#x27;s most significant views has been on the hijab in western civilization. According to him in the book of &quot;The Culture of Nakedness and the Nakedness of Culture&quot;, the issue of veiling and clothing in the West is problematic. He believes that materialism is the mentality which is governed by Western culture. The culture is based on the priority of material life, with no value in anything beyond materialism. The origin of materialism as a worldview is humanism, according to the renaissance. According to Haddad-Adel, religion serves an important role in Iranian education. Referring to the dominance of religious thought in education, he pointed out that religious education is one result of the victory of the Islamic revolution. He believes that the problem of human freedom is a permanent one. The problem itself has changed with the appearance of new theories in scientific and philosophic domains, particularly in the field of anthropology. He is also an admirer of the development of non-governmental higher education, and believes that developing such schools would lead to decreased demands on the administration of education and pedagogy.

==Personal life==
Haddad-Adel&#x27;s daughter married Mojtaba Khamenei, the son of Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran. This has led to the popular belief that he is among the most trusted and backed allies of Ayatollah Khamenei.

<doc id="469017" wikidata="Q737491" url="?curid=469017" title="Edwin Edwards">
<text>Edwin Washington Edwards (August 7, 1927 – July 12, 2021) was an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1965 to 1972 and as the 50th governor of Louisiana for four terms (1972–1980, 1984–1988, and 1992–1996). A member of the Democratic Party, he served twice as many elected terms as any other Louisiana chief executive. He served a total of almost 16 years in gubernatorial office, which at 5,784 days is the sixth-longest such tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history.

An influential figure in Louisiana politics, Edwards, who was dubbed the &quot;very last of the line of New Deal Southern Democrats&quot;, was long dogged by charges of corruption. In 2001, he was found guilty of racketeering charges and sentenced to ten years in federal prison. Edwards began serving his sentence in October 2002 in Fort Worth, Texas, and was later transferred to the federal facility in Oakdale, Louisiana. He was released from federal prison in January 2011, having served eight years. He was also considered to be the last remnant of the political machine founded and led by Huey Long and Earl Long to serve as governor.

In 2014, Edwards again sought election to the U.S. House of Representatives, running to represent . He placed first in the jungle primary, but was defeated by Republican Garret Graves by nearly 25 percentage points in the runoff election, a sign of Edwards&#x27; precipitous decline in popularity due to his felony conviction, as well as the Republican Party of Louisiana&#x27;s growing dominance over state politics.

==Early life and career==
Edwin Washington Edwards was born in rural Avoyelles Parish, near Marksville, on August 7, 1927. His father, Clarence Edwards, was a half-French Creole Presbyterian sharecropper, while his mother, the former Agnès Brouillette, was a French-speaking Roman Catholic. Edwards&#x27; ancestors were among early Louisiana colonists from France who eventually settled in Avoyelles Parish, referred to as the original French Creoles. Edwards, like many 20th century politicians from Avoyelles, assumed that he had Cajun ancestry, when in fact he may have had none. His father was descended from a family in Kentucky, who came to Louisiana during the American Civil War. His great-great-grandfather, William Edwards, was killed in Marksville at the beginning of the American Civil War because of his pro-Union sentiment.

The young Edwards had planned on a career as a preacher. As a young man, he did some preaching for the Marksville Church of the Nazarene. He served briefly in the U.S. Navy Air Corps near the end of World War II. After his return from the military, he graduated at the age of twenty-one from Louisiana State University Law Center and began practicing law in Crowley, the seat of Acadia Parish. He relocated there in 1949 after his sister, Audrey E. Isbell, who had moved there with her husband, told him there were few French-speaking attorneys in the southwestern Louisiana community.

Edwards entered politics through election to the Crowley City Council in 1954. He was a member of the Democratic Party which, in that era, had a monopoly on public offices in Louisiana, but which fell out of favor in the late 20th century. Edwards remained on the Crowley council until his election to the Louisiana State Senate in 1964; in that race he defeated, in a major political upset in the Democratic primary, the incumbent Bill Cleveland, a Crowley businessman who had served for twenty years in both houses of the Louisiana legislature. Years later as governor, Edwards appointed Cleveland&#x27;s daughter, Willie Mae Fulkerson (1924–2009), a former member of the Crowley City Council, to the Louisiana Board of Prisons.

==1971–1972 campaign for governor==
In the election of 1971–1972, Edwards won the governorship after finishing first in a field of seventeen candidates in the Democratic primary, including the final race of former governor Jimmie Davis and Gillis Long, a relative of Huey Long. His greatest support came from southern Louisiana, particularly among its large numbers of Cajun, Creole, and African-American voters.

Both Edwards and Johnston ran on reform-oriented platforms during the primary, but Edwards was more adept at making political deals and building alliances for the runoff round of voting. Edwards said that the major philosophical difference that he held with Johnston was in regard to their &quot;awareness of problems of the poor&quot;. Johnston won the endorsement of Edwards&#x27; legislative colleague, Joe D. Waggonner of Bossier Parish, but the Shreveport state senator declined to accept Edwards&#x27; offer of a televised debate between the two.

Bill Dodd, who was defeated for state superintendent of education in the same election cycle that Edwards was winning the governorship in for the first time, attributed the Edwards victory in part to political kingmaker Louis J. Roussel Jr., of New Orleans. According to Dodd, Roussel &quot;can do more than any other individual in Louisiana to elect any candidate he supports for any office in this state. ... He is such a good administrator and motivator that he can put together an organization that will win in business and in politics.&quot;

==First two terms as governor, 1972–1980==
Both in his political rhetoric and in his public persona, Edwards cast himself as a Louisiana populist in the tradition of Huey P. Long and Earl K. Long. He was inaugurated as governor on May 9, 1972. One of his first acts was to call for a constitutional convention to overhaul Louisiana&#x27;s bulky charter.

On taking office, Edwards hired J. Kelly Nix as his executive assistant and in 1974 elevated him to first executive assistant. In the second term, however, Nix left the administration to take office as the Louisiana state school superintendent. Dale Thorn, who had been Edwards&#x27; press secretary while he was in Congress, continued in that position for the first and most of the second Edwards terms. He was later associate commissioner of higher education for the Louisiana Board of Regents, and an LSU journalism professor.

Under Edwards, Michael H. O&#x27;Keefe of New Orleans in 1976 was named president of the state Senate, an office that was held by the lieutenant governor prior to the implementation of the state Constitution of 1974. In 1983, as Edwards prepared to return to office, O&#x27;Keefe was engulfed in scandal and forced to resign as senate president. He was as replaced by Edwards loyalist Samuel B. Nunez Jr., of Chalmette in St. Bernard Parish. On the same day Edwards won election to a third term, O&#x27;Keefe lost his bid for a seventh term by a wide margin to state Rep. Ben Bagert. In 2013, O&#x27;Keefe was still serving time in prison for a 1999 conviction.

During his first two terms in office, Edwards developed a reputation for being one of the most colorful and flamboyant politicians in the history of a state known for its unorthodox political figures. Charismatic, well dressed, and quick with clever one-liners and retorts, Edwards maintained wide popularity.

===Policies and achievements===
After enduring three grueling rounds of voting in the 1971–1972 campaign, Edwards pushed a bill through the legislature that limited state elections to two rounds by having Democratic, Republican, and independent candidates run together on the same ballot in a nonpartisan blanket primary. Though the jungle primary system was intended to benefit Edwards&#x27; own political career, many observers cite it as being a major factor in the eventual rise of the state&#x27;s Republican Party and the creation of a genuinely competitive two-party system. For this, Edwards was facetiously christened &quot;father of Louisiana&#x27;s Republican Party&quot;.

William Denis Brown, III, a lawyer and a state senator from Monroe, was Edwards&#x27;s floor leader in the upper legislative chamber in the first term as governor. A native of Vicksburg, Mississippi reared on a plantation north of Lake Providence in East Carroll Parish, Brown was instrumental in drafting the Louisiana Mineral Code. Thereafter from 1980 to 1988, Brown was the chairman of the Louisiana Board of Ethics.

Early in the first gubernatorial term, Edwards initiated the creation of the first new Louisiana state constitution in more than a half century. He intended to replace the Constitution of 1921, an unwieldy and outmoded document burdened with hundreds of amendments. A constitutional convention was held in 1973; the resulting document was put into effect in 1975. , the 1973 Constitution remains in effect. Edwards also undertook a major reorganization of the state government, abolishing over 80 state agencies and modeling the remaining structure after that of the federal government.

Edwards named State Representative J. Burton Angelle of Breaux Bridge as his director of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, a key appointment which Angelle filled for Edwards&#x27; first three terms of office.

Edwards&#x27; tenure in the 1970s coincided with a huge boom in the state&#x27;s oil and gas industry after the gas pricing crisis of 1973. Edwards was able to greatly expand the state&#x27;s oil revenues by basing severance taxes on a percentage of the price of each barrel rather than the former flat rate. This oil money fueled a massive increase in state spending (a 163% increase between 1972 and 1980), and Edwards was able to consistently balance the state budget due to the boom in oil revenue. Much of this increased spending went toward health and human services programs and increased funding for vocational-technical schools and higher education.

Edwards easily won reelection in 1975, with 750,107 votes (62.3 percent). In second place was Democratic state senator Robert G. &quot;Bob&quot; Jones of Lake Charles, son of former governor Sam Houston Jones, with 292,220 (24.3 percent). Secretary of State Wade O. Martin Jr., ran third with 146,363 (12.2 percent). Thereafter, Jones and Martin became Republicans. Addison Roswell Thompson, the perennial segregationist candidate from New Orleans, made his last race for governor in the 1975 primary.

===Early scandals===
Though arguably minor compared to the Edwards scandals of the 1980s and 1990s, the governor was embroiled in several ethics controversies during his first two terms in office. At the time, Edwards was remarkably candid about his questionable practices. When questioned about receiving illegal campaign contributions, he replied that &quot;It was illegal for them to give, but not for me to receive.&quot; He also insisted he saw no problem with investing in a proposed New Orleans office building called &quot;One Edwards Square&quot; (it was never actually named that) while still governor, and demonstrated his gambling prowess to the press on one of his frequent gambling trips to Las Vegas. Later, Edwards&#x27; commissioner of administration Charles Roemerfather of future governor Buddy Roemer – was convicted of taking bribes and having connections with Mafia boss Carlos Marcello. Edwards managed to avoid direct implication in the Roemer case.

During the governor&#x27;s first term, a disaffected former Edwards bodyguard named Clyde Vidrine made several high-profile accusations of corruption, including the sale of state agency posts. The accusations were investigated by a grand jury, but the Edwards administration attacked Vidrine&#x27;s credibility and the investigation stalled. Later, Vidrine published a tell-all book called &quot;Just Takin&#x27; Orders&quot;, which included salacious details of Edwards&#x27; frequent gambling trips and extramarital escapades. Vidrine was murdered in December 1986 by the husband of a woman he was guarding, who believed Vidrine was having an affair with his wife.

In a 1976 scandal known as Koreagate, it came to light that Edwards and his wife Elaine had received questionable gifts in 1971, while Edwards was a U.S. representative. South Korean rice broker Tongsun Park was under investigation for trying to bribe American legislators on behalf of the South Korean government, and for making millions of dollars in commissions on American purchases of South Korean rice. Edwards admitted that Park gave Elaine an envelope containing $10,000 in cash, but insisted that the gift was given out of friendship and that there was nothing improper about it. In the course of the controversy, Edwards stated that he thought it was &quot;super moralistic&quot; for the U.S. government to prohibit American businessmen to accept gifts from foreign officials in the course of their business dealings. The scandal also engulfed Edwards&#x27;s former congressional colleague Otto Passman of Monroe, who was later acquitted of all charges in the case, but nonetheless was defeated in his 1976 re-election bid by Jerry Huckaby of Ringgold.

==First political comeback: Edwards vs. Treen, 1983==

Barred by the state constitution from seeking a third term immediately after his second, Edwards temporarily left politics in 1980 but made it clear he would run again for governor in 1983. He began raising money and touring the state long before the 1983 election, maintaining what supporters called &quot;the government in waiting&quot;. Early in 1982, Edwards said that he was so committed to running again for governor that &quot;only death alone can separate me from this. ... We are being led by a governor whose only answer to unemployment is to buy a $350,000 jet.&quot;

In 1979, Republican David Treen was narrowly elected governor on a pledge of good government reform. Edwards had supported Treen&#x27;s opponent, Democratic Public Service Commissioner Louis Lambert of Ascension Parish. As widely expected, Edwards in 1983 defeated Treen&#x27;s re-election attempt. The election offered a clear contrast between the flamboyant, charismatic Edwards and the low-key, policy-oriented Treen. While Treen focused on Edwards&#x27; reputation for corruption and dishonesty, Edwards sought to portray Treen as incompetent and unresponsive to the public. Treen said of Edwards: &quot;It&#x27;s difficult for me to understand his popularity&quot;, which indicated in the eyes of many that he did not fully comprehend Louisiana politics. The two major candidates spent over $18 million (approximately $56.25 million in 2024 dollars) between them; the election became renowned as one of the most expensive campaigns ever conducted in a state the size of Louisiana. John Maginnis&#x27; 1984 book, &quot;The Last Hayride&quot;, chronicles this colorful but lopsided campaign.
Before election day, Edwards joked with reporters: &quot;The only way I can lose this election is if I&#x27;m caught in bed with either a dead girl or a live boy.&quot; Edwards zinged Treen many times, once describing Treen as &quot;so slow it takes him an hour and a half to watch &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.&quot; During a gubernatorial debate in 1983, Treen asked Edwards, &quot;How come you talk out of both sides of your mouth?&quot; Edwards instantly responded, &quot;So people like you with only half a brain can understand me.&quot;

Edwards&#x27; brother, Marion David Edwards (1928–2013), was part of the 1983 campaign and of the entourage that headed to France and Belgium early in 1984 to raise money to repay a lingering $4.2 million campaign debt. Six hundred supporters joined the Edwardses on an eight-day tour that included dinner at Versailles and gambling in Monte Carlo. Each paid $10,000. Edwards expected a 70 percent profit on the contributors&#x27; tickets to retire the debt. Bumper stickers were printed in blue and gold campaign colors and distributed to those who contributed to the retirement of this debt. For years afterwards, motorists saw stickers on vehicles bearing the slogan, &quot;I did Paris with the Gov.&quot;

==Third term as governor, 1984–1988==
State finances nosedived during the third Edwards administration. Money from petroleum severance taxes decreased sharply in the middle 1980s because of plummeting oil prices. In 1984, Edwards attempted to deal with the erosion of state revenue by approving $730 million—Edwards had requested $1.1 billion—in new personal taxes, including a 1 percentage point increase in the state sales tax, $61 million in higher corporate income taxes, and $190 million in additional gasoline taxes. The legislature, overwhelmingly dominated by lawmakers beholden to Edwards, passed these taxes into law, but the taxes were highly unpopular and damaged Edwards&#x27; level of public support. Republican state representative Terry W. Gee of New Orleans said at the time, &quot;Nobody realized the magnitude of what&#x27;s going on; I&#x27;ve had 180 phone calls in two days against the higher taxes.&quot;

Much of Edwards&#x27; support in the 1970s had been fueled by high levels of social spending during times of economic prosperity; with economic conditions worsening, his popularity waned. To obtain passage of the higher taxes, Edwards first submitted Treen&#x27;s 1984–1985 proposed budget as a warning to lawmakers. The Treen budget, he claimed, would cut state spending too drastically and cause roads to fall apart, bridges to collapse, and insurance premiums to skyrocket. Edwards predicted that if lawmakers passed Treen&#x27;s budget instead of the higher taxes the voters would rebel and blame the legislature itself for the results. In the end, Edwards got most of what he wanted and was able to use the excuse of teacher pay increases to put pressure on lawmakers.

===John Volz indictment and trials===
In February 1985, soon after his third term began, Edwards was forced to stand trial on charges of mail fraud, obstruction of justice, and bribery, brought by U.S. Attorney John Volz. The charges were centered around an alleged scheme in which Edwards and his associates received almost $2 million in exchange for granting preferential treatment to companies dealing with state hospitals. Edwards proclaimed his innocence and insisted that the charges were politically motivated by Volz and the Republican Party. The first trial resulted in a mistrial in December 1985, while a second trial in 1986 resulted in an acquittal. After Edwards and his four co-defendants were acquitted, the hotel where the jurors had been sequestered revealed that half of the jurors had stolen towels as they left. Edwards quipped that he had been judged by a &quot;jury of my peers&quot;.

Russell B. Long had correctly predicted in March 1985 that Edwards would indeed be acquitted by a Louisiana jury and that the ensuing trial would not disrupt state government. When Long announced his retirement from the U.S. Senate seat that he had held since 1948, he indicated his preference for Edwards as his senatorial successor but added, correctly, that he did not think Edwards would enter the 1986 Senate election. Long&#x27;s successor would be U.S. Representative John Breaux, Edwards&#x27; successor for the 7th District seat 14 years earlier.

Prosecutors referred to Marion Edwards, also indicted in the alleged health care scheme, as a &quot;bag man&quot; for his brother. Marion ridiculed this characterization at a French Quarter bar in New Orleans, when media representatives were present. He placed a shopping bag on his head to resemble a crown and tossed about phony $100 bills.

Edwards later recited during a toast at a French Quarter bar, though his beverage was non-alcoholic as he was a teetotaler, a rhyming invitation for Volz to &quot;kiss my ass&quot;. The trials were rather lengthy, and at one point during the first trial but before the mistrial Edwards rode to the Hale Boggs U.S. Courthouse on a mule from his hotel. When asked by reporters why he did so, he replied something to the effect that it was symbolic of the speed and intellect of the federal judicial system, but also that he supported &quot;tradition&quot;. Marion Edwards, an attorney, often wore a pinstripe suit with a top hat and cane and held comedic press briefings at the end of each court session on the steps of the courthouse. Marion Edwards mocked the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney Volz, and United States Judge Marcel Livaudais, who presided over the trials.

Even after beating the Volz indictment, Edwin Edwards&#x27; popularity was in decline. Despite his acquittal, the trial brought many sordid details of Edwards&#x27;s conduct under public scrutiny. It was revealed that during frequent gambling trips to Las Vegas, Edwards lost hundreds of thousands of dollars under aliases such as T. Wong, E. Lee, B. True and Ed Neff (Edwards said he signed E. Nuff (enough), but computers read the name as &quot;Ed Neff&quot;), later paying these gambling debts using suitcases stuffed with cash of unknown origin.

After the trial, Edwards&#x27; support for the legalization of gambling as a solution to the state&#x27;s severe revenue shortages contributed to a further decline in his popularity. He had made unpopular budget cuts to education and other social programs earlier in his term. Beginning in January 1986, he argued that legalizing casino gambling in up to fifteen locations and creating a state lottery would be a way to restore the programs, but the state legislature rejected his gambling proposals. Entering a tough re-election campaign in 1987, Edwards seemed vulnerable. Going into the election, his disapproval ratings ranged from 52 to 71 percent.

At first Edwards had predicted that a casino and a state lottery would net the state $600 million; then he lowered the expectations to $150 million. Both gambling measures would eventually be implemented, but not during Edwards&#x27; third term.

==Defeat: Edwards vs. Roemer, 1987==
Several notable candidates lined up to face Edwards in the 1987 gubernatorial election. Perhaps his strongest early challenger was Republican Congressman Bob Livingston. Also in the race were Billy Tauzin, a then-Democratic Cajun congressman from Thibodaux who was a strong Edwards supporter while serving in the state legislature from 1972 to 1980; Democratic secretary of state Jim Brown of Ferriday, and a Democratic congressman from Bossier City, Buddy Roemer, the son of former Commissioner of Administration Charles Roemer, who climbed up from a series of low poll rankings early in the campaign.

===&quot;Anyone But Edwards&quot;===
Edwards was the issue of the campaign. Because of his name recognition, his resilient supporters, and unmatched political skill, even a weakened Edwards could safely assume he would win a place in Louisiana&#x27;s unique primary election system runoff. The question was whether his opponent in the runoff would be someone who could beat him.

There was a prevailing sense in the race that Edwards needed Livingston in the runoff. Livingston was a Republican in a state that had at that point elected only one Republican governor since Reconstruction. And Livingston was widely perceived as lacking in charisma and personality, which would work to Edwards&#x27;s advantage. Any other opponent, a moderate Democrat without the ethical problems, would be dangerous. To that end, Edwards talked up Livingston. Perhaps the key moment in the 1987 race came at a forum between the candidates. As usual, the main topic of discussion was Edwin Edwards. His challengers were asked, in succession, if they would consider endorsing Edwards in the general election if they did not make it to the runoff. The candidates hedged, particularly Secretary of State Brown, a reliable Edwards supporter in the state Senate who in his 1979 election drew many of the same voters who supported fellow Democrat Louis Lambert in his failed gubernatorial bid in the same general election vs. Treen. The last candidate to speak was Buddy Roemer: &quot;No, we&#x27;ve got to slay the dragon. I would endorse anyone but Edwards.&quot; The next day, as political commentator John Maginnis put it, Jim Brown was explaining his statement while Buddy Roemer was ordering &quot;Slay the Dragon&quot; buttons. Boosted by his endorsement as the &#x27;good government candidate&#x27; by nearly every newspaper in the state, Roemer stormed from last place in the polls and on election night, overtook Edwin Edwards and placed first in the primary election, with 33 percent of the vote compared with Edwards&#x27; 28 percent. This marked the first time Edwin Edwards ever finished other than in first place in an election.

In what seemed to be the end of Edwards&#x27; political career, the governor withdrew from the contest in his concession speech, automatically electing Buddy Roemer governor. In fact, he was cleverly setting a trap for Roemer. By withdrawing, Edwards denied Roemer the opportunity to build a governing coalition in the general election race, and denied him the decisive majority victory that he surely would have attained. In one stroke, Edwards made Buddy Roemer a minority governor. Also, Edwards virtually ceded control of the state to Roemer even before his inauguration. By doing so, he passed on the burden of the state&#x27;s problems to the new governor, who was essentially under the gun even before assuming office. For four years, Roemer struggled to be a reform governor of Louisiana as so many had before him. And although virtually no one realized it at the time, Edwin Edwards quietly waited in the wings for a return to power.

==Second comeback: Edwards vs. Duke, 1991==

As the 1991 governor&#x27;s race drew near, many of Edwards&#x27; friends encouraged him to abandon his planned comeback, believing he had no chance of winning. After Edwards&#x27; loss in 1987, journalist Lanny Keller wrote that the only way Edwin Edwards could ever be elected again was to run against Adolf Hitler. Edwards&#x27; runoff opponent would be former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, David Duke.

The runoff between an avowed white supremacist and a suspected felon gained national attention. The Louisiana Coalition against Racism and Nazism was formed to challenge Duke, with its leadership including longtime Treen supporter Beth Rickey, a member of the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee from New Orleans. The coalition revealed through a recording of Duke at a White Nationalist conference that he was still involved in Ku Klux Klan activities.

Edwards found himself receiving endorsements from notable Republican politicians including Treen, Roemer, and even president George H. W. Bush. A popular bumper sticker urging support for Edwards read &quot;Vote For the Crook. It&#x27;s Important.&quot; Another read &quot;Vote for the Lizard, not the Wizard.&quot; Edwards said of Duke that &quot;the only thing we have in common is that we both have been wizards beneath the sheets&quot; and feigned concern for Duke&#x27;s health due to smoke inhalation &quot;because he&#x27;s around so many burning crosses&quot;. When a reporter asked Edwards what he needed to do to triumph over Duke, Edwards replied &quot;stay alive&quot;. On election day, Edwards defeated Duke in a landslide, 61% to 39%, a margin of nearly 400,000 votes.

==Fourth term as governor, 1992–1996==
In his last term, Edwards asked his boyhood friend, Raymond Laborde, to leave the state House after twenty years to serve as commissioner of administration. Laborde, who had once defeated Edwards for class president at Marksville High School and had earlier been his legislative floor leader, agreed to join the administration. He invited former state Representative Kevin P. Reilly Sr., of Baton Rouge, former CEO of Lamar Advertising Company to serve as secretary of economic development. Reilly had been removed in 1986 as chairman of the Louisiana House Appropriations Committee after having criticized Edwards.

In 1992, Edwards appointed the professional penologist, Richard Stalder, as secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety &amp; Corrections, a position that used to be given to political supporters. Stalder remained secretary until 2008, serving during three subsequent gubernatorial terms in the position.

During his previous term as governor, Edwards promoted casino gambling in Louisiana, which had been a major part of his platform in the 1991 campaign. In June 1992, his heavy lobbying led the state legislature to pass a bill calling for a single large land-based casino in New Orleans. He also appointed a board that, at his private direction, awarded 15 floating riverboat casinos that had been authorized by the Legislature and the Roemer administration. He appointed a political ally, Paul Fontenot, to head the State Police; he would oversee the licensing and investigation of casino operators. On another front he again demonstrated his broad commitment to civil rights by becoming the first Southern governor to issue an executive order protecting lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons from discrimination in state governmental services, employment, and contracts.

Despite the discovery that some licensees had links to organized crime or other unsavory ties, Edwards blocked the revocation of their licenses. But a political backlash against gambling-related corruption began. Though he had originally planned to run for re-election in 1995, he announced in June 1994, shortly after marrying his second wife Candy Picou, that he would be retiring from politics at the end of his term. Edwards was succeeded as governor by State Senator Murphy J. Foster Jr., who ran as an opponent of gambling interests. Edwards retired to a newly purchased home in Baton Rouge, intent on returning to a private law practice and living out his remaining days in contentment with his young wife, Candy, who was Edwards&#x27; junior by 37 years.

==Indictment and conviction==
Former Congressman Cleo Fields achieved considerable notoriety in 1997 when an FBI surveillance videotape showed him accepting a large amount of cash (about $20,000) from Edwards and stuffing it in his pockets. At the time Fields stated that the incident was just an innocent business transaction between friends, and said there was a humorous explanation, which he would make public shortly thereafter. A cloud hung over Fields as an unindicted co-conspirator in Edwards&#x27; criminal trial and in the end Fields refused to deliver the promised &quot;humorous&quot; explanation, stating that at the time of the cash transfer, he was not an elected official, and therefore under no obligation to explain publicly.

After being fingered by Texas for-profit prison entrepreneur Patrick Graham, who allegedly gave him $845,000 in conjunction with a scheme to locate a private juvenile prison in Jena in La Salle Parish, Edwards was indicted in 1998 by the federal government with the prosecution led by U.S. Attorney Eddie Jordan. The prosecution soon released transcripts of audio conversations, and excerpts of video surveillance that seemed to indicate dubious financial transactions. The Edwards investigation also resulted in the conviction of San Francisco 49ers owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., who admitted to paying Edwards a $400,000 bribe (DeBartolo was convicted for not reporting the extortion) in exchange for Edwards&#x27;s assistance in securing a riverboat casino license. The conviction forced DeBartolo to turn over control of the 49ers to his sister, Denise DeBartolo York.

Edwards was found guilty on seventeen of twenty-six counts, including racketeering, extortion, money laundering, mail fraud, and wire fraud; his son Stephen was convicted on 18 counts. &quot;I did not do anything wrong as a governor, even if you accept the verdict as it is, it doesn&#x27;t indicate that&quot;, Edwards told the press after his conviction. On his way to prison he said, &quot;I will be a model prisoner, as I have been a model citizen&quot;. From 2002 to 2004 Edwin Edwards was incarcerated at the Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas.

Edwards&#x27; sometime co-conspirator, Cecil Brown, a Eunice cattleman, was convicted for his part in the payoffs in 2002. Brown was also convicted in 2000 on four counts of extortion and racketeering by the same jury which found Edwin and Stephen Edwards guilty.

In 2004, Edwards filed for divorce from his second wife Candy, saying that Mrs. Edwards had &quot;suffered enough&quot; during his incarceration. In June 2005, the former Mrs. Edwards was arrested for threatening a police officer at a traffic stop in Port Barre, screaming &quot;don&#x27;t you know who I am?&quot;

In 2005, Edwards was moved to the Federal Correctional Institution in Oakdale in Allen Parish, where he served his sentence as inmate #03128-095. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, he was scheduled to be released on July 6, 2011. In prison, he served as the facility&#x27;s librarian: &quot;I did what I could for my fellow inmates. I helped a number of them get their GEDs and I was helping several more when my term expired. Now, I have to be honest; I didn&#x27;t stick around to see if they succeeded...&quot;

Two men whom Edwards defeated in Louisiana elections—David C. Treen and J. Bennett Johnston Jr.—and a third who was his protégé and successor in the Seventh District U.S. House seat, U.S. Senator John Breaux, confirmed in July 2007 that they intended to approach then U.S. President George W. Bush to seek a pardon or commutation for Edwards, who celebrated his 80th birthday in prison in August 2007. Bush denied a pardon for Edwards before he left the presidency on January 20, 2009.

Edwards supporters also lobbied U.S. President Barack Obama for a pardon for Edwards so he might run in the 2011 Louisiana gubernatorial election. Obama did not reply to petitions by supporters of Edwards and lacking a pardon, Edwards remained ineligible to seek the governorship of Louisiana until the end of his life and would have only been eligible to run after fifteen years would have passed from the end of his sentence.

In 2009, Edwards was listed as an &quot;honorary pallbearer&quot; at the funeral of perennial political candidate L. D. Knox of Winnsboro, who in the 1979 gubernatorial contest, when Edwards was not on the ballot, legally changed his name to &quot;None of the Above&quot; Knox to dramatize his support for the &quot;None of the Above&quot; option in elections.

On January 13, 2011, Edwards was released from prison and served the remainder of his sentence at a halfway house. His sentence ended on July 6, 2011 and he began three years of probation. He entered into home confinement at his daughter&#x27;s Denham Springs, Louisiana home through the supervision of a halfway house, on January 13, 2011. Following that, Edwards was placed on probation. On February 7, 2013, Edwards was granted early release from probation due to good behavior. His wife Trina made the announcement on her Facebook page.

In a poll taken in October 2011, months after he had been released from prison, 30 percent of respondents named Edwards the state&#x27;s best governor since 1980.

==2014 Congressional election==
In February 2014, Edwards announced that he was contemplating running in the 2014 election to represent the Louisiana&#x27;s 6th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives, which is centered on the state capital of Baton Rouge. With U.S. Representative Bill Cassidy exiting the seat to run for the Senate, Edwards said of the solidly Republican district: &quot;I&#x27;m the only hope the Democrats have here.&quot; He formally declared his candidacy at a March 17 meeting of the Press Club of Baton Rouge, saying, &quot;I want you to know, I&#x27;m going to give it every effort.&quot; If no candidate wins a majority of the vote, a runoff would be held on December 6, 2014, between the top two candidates. Two other Democrats, a Libertarian and nine Republicans, most notably Garret Graves, a former aide to Governor Bobby Jindal, State Senator Dan Claitor, businessman Paul Dietzel, II, and State Representative Lenar Whitney, also sought the seat.

After Edwards&#x27; announcement, Cassidy told KEEL radio news in Shreveport that he doubted that Edwards &quot;has a chance. It&#x27;s a conservative district, and he&#x27;s obviously not a conservative. But it kind of shows, I think, to a certain extent that the Democratic bench is weak.&quot; Louisiana political writer John Maginnis said that Edwards was &quot;likely to make the runoff&quot; because of his name recognition, but &quot;I don&#x27;t see how he could win in a strong GOP-performance district like the 6th. But it should be entertaining.&quot; State pollster Elliott Stonecipher said that &quot;the most basic math of the Edwards race yields an &#x27;it is not impossible&#x27; answer&quot; and former governor Buddy Roemer said that while it is unlikely, &quot;yes, [Edwards] can win&quot;.

An April 2014 article in &quot;Politico&quot; that discussed his chances noted that he was &quot;still sharp as a razor&quot; and &quot;in remarkably vigorous health&quot;. He pronounced himself &quot;disappointed&quot; with President Obama for &quot;sitting&quot; on the Keystone Pipeline and listed his campaign priorities as &quot;Building support for a high-speed rail system between Baton Rouge and New Orleans and emphasizing the good aspects of Obamacare, while doing what I can to change or amend the provisions that I think are onerous.&quot; He said that he would have voted against the Affordable Care Act, but criticized Governor Jindal for not accepting the Medicaid expansion. If elected, he hoped to serve on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, to spur the construction of elevated roadways in the state.

A September 2014 survey of statewide Louisiana voters by Public Policy Polling found that 40% had a favourable opinion of Edwards, 44% did not and 17% were unsure. Asked whether they would rather have Edwards as governor than incumbent Republican governor Bobby Jindal, 47% said they would prefer Edwards, 43% preferred Jindal and 10% were not sure.

Edwards finished first in every poll taken of the race, though only with a plurality. Runoff polls showed him losing to all of his Republican opponents. An article in &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; in late October 2014 noted that he had run a vigorous, serious campaign and noted that, as previously, analysts were split on whether he could actually win. David Wasserman of &quot;The Cook Political Report&quot; said that for Edwards, &quot;mathematically, victory is something close to impossibility.&quot; Conversely, a spokesman for Republican opponent Lenar Whitney and political analyst Michael Beychok both said that he had a chance to win and Republican candidate Garret Graves said &quot;There&#x27;s no one alive anymore in this state that has the experience or, quite frankly, the tactics (of) Edwin Edwards.&quot; Edwards was expected to make the runoff, with his chances dependent on which Republican joins him, with several analysts saying that Edwards&#x27; best chance would come if Whitney, the most conservative Republican running, does so. Edwards&#x27; strategy was to appeal to black and Cajun voters and conservative Democrats, also campaigning on college campuses to appeal to younger voters. Columnist Bob Mann predicted that if Edwards made the runoff, the media would decry Louisiana voters&#x27; toleration for corruption when, &quot;in truth (Edwards) never really had a chance to win.&quot;

As expected, Edwards as the principal Democratic candidate led the 2014 primary field for Congress with 77,862 votes (30.1 percent), winning every parish in the district. He then faced the Republican runner-up, Garret Graves, in the December 6 runoff election. Graves had received 70,706 &quot;jungle primary&quot; votes (27.4 percent). Losing Republican candidates were Paul Dietzel II, with 35,013 votes (13.6 percent), state Senator Dan Claitor with 26,520 (10.3 percent), and state Representative Lenar Whitney with 19,146 votes (7.4 percent). Edwards lost to Graves by a 62–38 percent margin in the runoff. It was only the second loss of his political career.

==Edwards&#x27; record of longevity==
Edwards has the seventh longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,784 days. Few governors have served four four-year terms. Edwards followed George Wallace of Alabama, Jim Hunt of North Carolina, Bill Janklow of South Dakota, Terry Branstad of Iowa, Lewis Cass of Michigan, and Jim Rhodes of Ohio as 16-year governors. However, Branstad was elected to a fifth nonconsecutive term as governor of Iowa in 2010, placing him second to George Clinton of New York (21 years) as the longest-serving governor in U.S. history, and won a sixth term as governor in 2014. In December 2015 Branstad surpassed New York&#x27;s George Clinton as the longest-tenured governor in American history, with 8,169 days in office.

Veteran journalist Iris Kelso once described Edwards as clearly &quot;the most interesting&quot; of the six governors that she had covered while working for three newspapers and WDSU, the NBC television affiliate in New Orleans. Kelso declared Edwards more colorful than Earl Long, whom she covered for less than a year in the office.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and family===
In 1949, Edwards married Elaine Schwartzenburg, whom he had met at Marksville High School. The couple had four children, daughters Anna and Victoria and sons Stephen and David. In August 1972, Edwards appointed her as an interim U.S. senator to complete the unfinished term of Allen J. Ellender of Houma, who died while campaigning for his seventh term in office. Ellender was President pro tempore and chairman of the Committee on Appropriations at the time of his death. Elaine Edwards resigned seat six days after the election of Ellender&#x27;s permanent successor, J. Bennett Johnston, in order to give Johnston seniority over other new senators elected on November 7, 1972 (including future President Joe Biden).

On July 1, 1989, the couple divorced after forty years of marriage. They had begun living apart on March 15, 1988, the day after Edwards&#x27; third term ended. Mrs. Edwards did not reside at the Louisiana Governor&#x27;s Mansion during Edwin&#x27;s third term, instead staying at the family&#x27;s ranch in southeast Baton Rouge.

In 1994, Edwards married Candy Picou (born 1964). In 1997, the couple entered the headlines when they attempted to have a child. Edwards had a vasectomy reversal, and the couple froze sperm to attempt to have a baby but were not successful.

In July 2011, Edwards married Trina Grimes, his prison pen pal. They began corresponding while he was serving his sentence for corruption. At the time of the wedding, he was 83, and she was 32. On August 1, 2013, Grimes gave birth to their child. In 2013, Edwards and Trina co-starred in an A&amp;E reality show, &quot;The Governor&#x27;s Wife&quot; based on their life together.

===Extended family===
One of Edwards&#x27;s brothers, Nolan Edwards, a former assistant district attorney in Acadia Parish, was murdered in Crowley by an irate client in 1983, the same year that Edwards was engineering his comeback bid for a third term as governor. Nolan&#x27;s killer, Rodney Wingate Jr., of Church Point, Louisiana, then killed himself. Wingate had been pardoned by Governor Edwards in 1980 for two drug convictions in the 1970s, a pardon procured through the intervention of Nolan Edwards. Nolan&#x27;s murder halted the 1983 politicking. Newspapers carried a photograph of brothers Edwin and Marion locked in an embrace on an airport tarmac.

Marion Edwards, an insurance agent and political consultant, was a cancer survivor and counseled other patients for many years. Born on July 10, 1928, in Marksville, he died on January 12, 2013, at the age of eighty-four at his home in Broussard near Lafayette, Louisiana. The cause of death was not released. The Marion D. Edwards Fellowship in Hepatic Oncology at the M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute in Houston, Texas, is named in his honor. Marion Edwards, who was Nazarene, was survived by his second wife, the former Deborah &quot;Penny&quot; Meaux, and three daughters from his first marriage to Aline Luther Edwards: Wanda Edwards, Elizabeth Kersten, and Donna Edwards.

Another brother, Allen Edwards, the longtime owner of a farm and heavy equipment company in Quitman in northern Arkansas, died in 2009, while Edwards was in prison. Edwards did not attend the funeral because of security difficulties.

Edwards was an uncle by marriage to former U.S. Representative Charles Boustany, a Republican from Lafayette, whose district includes much of the territory represented from 1965 to 1972 by then-U.S. Representative Edwin Edwards. Boustany&#x27;s wife is the former Bridget Edwards, a daughter of Nolan Edwards.

===Third wife and reality television show===
On July 29, 2011, Edwards married Trina Grimes Scott (born August 1978) from Baton Rouge, at the Monteleone Hotel in New Orleans. Edwards&#x27; one-time prison pen pal, she was fifty-one years his junior and was born midway in his second term as governor. She is a Republican.

Edwin and Trina Edwards were the subjects of the reality show &quot;The Governor&#x27;s Wife&quot;, which premiered October 27, 2013, on the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network. The program focused on Trina&#x27;s rearing of teenaged sons and acting as stepmother to Edwards&#x27; daughters who are almost twice her age. According to the A&amp;E description of the program: &quot;Between school projects, running for president of the Homeowner&#x27;s Association, fending off skeptics who think she&#x27;s a gold digger, and thoughts of adding a baby of their own to the mix, the Edwards clan truly represents a new take on the modern family.&quot; The couple announced February 15, 2013 that Trina was pregnant. Trina gave birth to their son on August 1, 2013.

Following Edwards&#x27;s death, Trina remarried in 2023 to Louisiana politician John Alario, who served as Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives during Edwards&#x27; third and fourth terms, and later as President of the Louisiana Senate under Governors Bobby Jindal and John Bel Edwards.

===Health and death===
Edwards did not drink alcohol or smoke.

In 2015, Edwards was hospitalized for pneumonia. On December 13, 2016, Edwards was hospitalized under stable condition again for pneumonia in Baton Rouge.

Edwards was rushed to the hospital again by ambulance in November 2020, with shortness of breath. Edwards returned to his home in Gonzales after spending two nights at Our Lady of the Lake Medical Center in Baton Rouge. It was reported that he had a common head cold and he reportedly tested negative for both COVID-19 and pneumonia, as well as the flu. His wife told the media that he was resting well and &quot;giving orders&quot; once he got home.

Edwards was sent to hospice care for pain in his lungs in Gonzales, Louisiana on July 6, 2021. He died six days later on July 12, 26 days short of his 94th birthday. The cause of death was respiratory complications. At the time of his death, Edwards had outlived four of his successors: Dave Treen, Buddy Roemer, Mike Foster, and Kathleen Blanco.

<text>Thunderbirds is a 2004 science fiction action-adventure film directed by Jonathan Frakes, written by William Osborne and Michael McCullers, and based on the television series of the same name created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson.

The film&#x27;s plot concerns the Hood, who traps International Rescue (IR) leader Jeff Tracy and four of his sons on board the damaged &quot;Thunderbird 5&quot; to steal the other &quot;Thunderbird&quot; vehicles and commit crimes that IR will be blamed for, prompting Jeff&#x27;s youngest son Alan and his friends Tin-Tin and Fermat to stop him. Unlike the original TV series, which combined puppetry and scale-model visual effects in a filming style dubbed &quot;Supermarionation&quot;, the film was made in live-action with CGI effects.

Released on 20 July 2004 in the United Kingdom and 30 July 2004 in the United States, the film received negative reviews from critics, who disparaged its wooden characters and thin plot, and was also a box-office bomb. Gerry Anderson also criticised the film, describing it as &quot;the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life&quot;, although Sylvia Anderson praised it as a &quot;great tribute&quot; to the series. The film&#x27;s soundtrack includes the songs &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot; by pop-rock band Busted, which peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and later won the 2004 UK Record of the Year award.

==Plot==
In 2010, the Tracy family, led by widowed former astronaut Jeff Tracy, operate International Rescue (IR), a secret organisation that aids those in need during disasters using technologically advanced machines called Thunderbirds, operating out of Tracy Island in the South Pacific. His youngest son Alan attends Wharton Academy, a boarding school in Massachusetts, with his best friend Fermat Hackenbacker, son of the Thunderbirds’ resident engineer Brains, and dreams of being a Thunderbird pilot like his older brothers Scott, John, Virgil, and Gordon.

IR agent Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward and her valet, Aloysius Parker, return Alan and Fermat to Tracy Island for spring break, where they are reunited with their friend Tin-Tin - the daughter of the Tracy family butler, Kyrano, but Alan is grounded shortly after arrival for attempting to fly Thunderbird 1. Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of Tracy Island, The Hood, a psychic criminal mastermind, had one of his accomplices plant a tracking beacon on the hull of Thunderbird 1 during a recent rescue on an oil rig, leading him to the base of International Rescue. Off shore from a submarine, the Hood fires a missile into space at the orbiting Thunderbird 5, cutting off all of IR&#x27;s communications and leaving space monitor John in peril. Jeff, Scott, Virgil and Gordon go to rescue John in Thunderbird 3, but The Hood and his team take over the island&#x27;s command center and shut off power to Thunderbird 5, trapping them all inside.

The Hood reveals that during one of International Rescue&#x27;s first operations, Jeff abandoned him in a collapsing illegal diamond mine, but rescued his half-brother, Kyrano. As revenge, he plans to use Thunderbird 2 to rob ten of the world&#x27;s major banks, thus plunging the international monetary system into chaos, with International Rescue held responsible and disgraced. Fermat removes Thunderbird 2&#x27;s guidance chip, delaying the Hood&#x27;s plan, and Alan contacts Jeff with its remote transmitter, insisting on confronting The Hood. Lady Penelope and Parker receive a distress signal from Tracy Island and fly there in FAB 1, where they engage the Hood&#x27;s minions in combat, but the Hood defeats them with his psychic powers. He then makes Alan give up the guidance chip by threatening to hurt his captured friends, Alan complies and they are all locked in the compound&#x27;s walk-in freezer.

The Hood and his minions pilot the now-repaired Thunderbird 2 to London and use the Mole to sink a monorail line into the Thames and drill into the Bank of England’s vaults. Alan and company escape and restore power to Thunderbird 5 before setting off in pursuit of The Hood in Thunderbird 1. Arriving in London, Alan and Tin-Tin rescue the submerged monorail car using Thunderbird 4 before pursuing the Hood. The rest of the Tracy family return from space in Thunderbird 3 and confront the Hood at the Bank, where he captures Jeff and Lady Penelope and challenges Alan to defeat him. While Alan fights The Hood on a catwalk over the moving drill of The Mole, The Hood is defeated by Tin-Tin, who as his niece is also able to use his powers. The Hood taunts Alan to let him die as his father did, but Alan rescues him, knowing that his father had actually tried unsuccessfully to save the Hood. The Hood and his team are arrested and International Rescue return to their island, where Alan, Fermat, and Tin-Tin are inducted as official members of the team.

==Production==

=== Development ===
&quot;Thunderbirds&quot; was the third theatrical release based upon the series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. It was preceded by &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot; in 1966 and &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot; in 1968, both films using the Supermarionation production techniques of the series.

Production of the film started in the mid-1990s when PolyGram Filmed Entertainment purchased the rights to the entire ITC Entertainment library, which included the original &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; series. Seeing the big-screen potential of the series, Peter Hewitt was signed on to direct, while Karey Kirkpatrick was signed on to write. While Hewitt was a lifelong fan of the series, Kirkpatrick was not, but watched all 32 episodes of the original series to immerse himself within the lore of the series. Hewitt and Kirkpatrick wrote a draft of the screenplay which was faithful to the series, but which they hoped would not alienate audiences who were unfamiliar with the franchise. Their script featured The Hood trying to steal Tracy Island&#x27;s power core to power a device controlled by arch villain Thaddeus Stone, which would transfer all of Earth&#x27;s gravity to the moon. After four drafts, Kirkpatrick left the project due to Working Title&#x27;s concerns that the film would not play well in the US market. (Working Title was the unit of PolyGram, and later Universal Studios when that company in 1999 bought out PolyGram&#x27;s assets that produced films in Britain.) Hewitt also left the production shortly afterwards due to his dislike for the new direction the film was taking.

Hewitt was replaced by Jonathan Frakes, a big fan of the original series whose credentials included another family science fiction film, &quot;Clockstoppers&quot;.

Mike Trim, who had worked on the original &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; show, was hired as a concept artist. Ultimately, his work, which included a design for an original pod vehicle named the &quot;Telehandler&quot;, went unused.

=== Casting ===
The film was the first family film of Brady Corbet, who played protagonist Alan Tracy.

Bill Paxton took on the role of Alan&#x27;s father, billionaire ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy. He had memories of watching the show as a child in Texas; a year before he was asked to join the film, he had been watching the show with his jet-lagged family as it was the only English video he&#x27;d been able to find in Amsterdam. Paxton described his character as &quot;a kind of teacher, this father figure who has to teach his sons, particularly his youngest son Alan, these basic lessons of ethics and integrity, about doing the right thing&quot;. One reason that he was attracted to the role was because it reminded him of 1960s non-profit vocationalism, and people &quot;choosing life professions not for monetary gain but for something that would be good for their souls&quot;.

Ben Kingsley accepted the part of the Hood because his children were &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; fans and, having just finished &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot;, he was ready for a more lighthearted role. He described himself as feeling &quot;totally at home&quot; on set, but joked that he should have kept the original Hood&#x27;s voice.

Sophia Myles was cast as Lady Penelope, who would recall Frakes as &quot;lovely&quot;, and having a &quot;great, positive energy&quot;. Much of her dialogue (and Ron Cook&#x27;s as Parker) was rewritten by Richard Curtis, as it wasn&#x27;t thought to be funny enough. It was because of watching the film with his son that Steven Moffat offered Myles a role in Series 2 of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Anthony Edwards was cast as Brains; he joined the production imagining it was a &quot;silly little kids&#x27; movie&quot;, but was impressed by Frakes&#x27;, and production designer John Beard&#x27;s, &quot;reverence&quot; for the original series. He also recalled the producers hoping Gerry Anderson would be a part of the production; conversely, Jamie Anderson claims that Gerry was &quot;kept at an arm&#x27;s length&quot; from the project, and that only in the final stages of post-production was he offered a large sum of money to promote the film, which he declined.

=== Filming and post-production ===
Filming began on March 3, 2003, at North Island in the Seychelles. An initial seven-day schedule became ten days after unexpected rain interfered with the shoot, and Fulton, who played Fermat, had to try to avoid developing a tan. Throughout production, Corbet was vocal about what he saw as flaws in the script; Corbet would go on to write and direct films of his own.Filming later moved to Pinewood Studios and on-location shooting in London. Upon arriving in London, Paxton, in order to immerse himself in the role, invited Winchester, Colenso, Torgersen, Corbet and Shrapnel for a meal. Shrapnel would later recall the experience positively, calling Paxton a &quot;great role model and a very dear friend&quot;.

Other filming locations included Wellington College, Berkshire for Alan&#x27;s school (&quot;Wharton Academy&quot;), University College London for the exterior of the fictional Bank of London, and Cliveden House, Buckinghamshire for Lady Penelope&#x27;s mansion; this latter location had speed bumps removed from the drive to avoid damage to the FAB 1 vehicle.

A number of scenes were excised from the final cut of the film. A different opening was filmed, with Alan partaking in some kind of motorcycle race; footage was included in trailers for the film. FAB-1 was also intended to be fired at by missiles when approaching Tracy Island for the second time, upon which a pedalo life raft would deploy; footage of this is utilised for a comedic scene at the end of the film. Versions of both scenes are present in novelizations and tie-in books.

&quot;Thunderbirds&quot; is dedicated to the memory of Stephen Lowen, a rigger on the film, who died in a fall whilst dismantling one of the sets.

=== Differences from the original ===

There are numerous changes from the original series. The Thunderbirds fleet, Tracy Island, and the International Rescue uniforms have all been redesigned; Tracy Island is now referred to by name in dialogue, as is the Hood. International Rescue is also referred to as &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; by the general public.

In the original series, Alan and Tin-Tin are much closer to the age of the rest of the Tracy brothers. Fermat Hackenbacker and Onaha are new characters conceived for the film, with the latter taking the position of Grandma Tracy, who has been omitted from the film. Tin-Tin and Kyrano change nationality in the film; they are Malaysian in the TV series but are depicted as being from India in the film.

Although the exact identities of the Thunderbirds remain secret, International Rescue now allows itself to be filmed and photographed on missions, which was forbidden in the original series.

==== Debate over setting ====

Promotional materials unanimously described this version of Jeff Tracy as having set up International Rescue in the year 2010. Some went on to describe the events of the &quot;film&quot; as taking place then, including StudioCanal&#x27;s own website. This change from the original series&#x27; setting (itself a source of controversy) was repeated enough to impact merchandise. Conversely, other promotional materials, including working trailers suggest that the actual events of the film take place in March 2020; if the setting of the original series is taken as 2026, then the ages of the Tracy brothers indeed line up. This is an opinion shared by Frakes, who argued that the setting was deliberately chosen &quot;it meant we didn’t mess with the continuity of the original show or the fondness that everyone has for it in terms of the timeline&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Thunderbirds&quot; grossed $28,283,637 worldwide, and with an estimated $57 million budget, the film was a box office bomb. Frakes attributed the film&#x27;s commercial failure to a combination of stiff competition from its contemporaries &quot;Shrek 2&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and its poor critical reception. Stuart Kemp of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; suggested that it may have been due to lack of appeal for older audiences who remembered the TV original.

===Critical response===
&quot;Thunderbirds&quot; received negative reviews. Those familiar with the series tended to be more negative. Sukhdev Sandhu of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called it &quot;a quite cretinous travesty of the original series&quot;, saying that the film lacks the TV series&#x27; romantic approach to technology (particularly mentioning its rushed version of the countdown to the Thunderbirds takeoff) and suffers from thin plotting and dialogue. He also regarded the entire trend of making films based on decades-old TV series as good-intentioned but misguided, arguing, &quot;Those programmes can be seen on terrestrial and cable TV. They&#x27;re available on DVD. They don&#x27;t need reviving and updating.&quot; The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;″s Amy Biancolli similarly called the film a &quot;rather breathtakingly misconceived attempt to revisit a vintage TV show that did not under any circumstances need to be revisited&quot;. She found the central character Alan &quot;whiny and uninteresting&quot;, the script poor, the plot contrived and unsatisfying, and the acting wooden, though she noted that her three children enjoyed it much more than she did. She gave it a C−. Ian Freer, writing for &quot;Empire&quot;, assessed that the film fails to either evoke nostalgia in the generation which watched &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; as children or provide snappy entertainment for the current generation of children. Like Sandhu, he felt the countdown sequence was so rushed that there is no sense of occasion to a Thunderbird taking to the sky. He also said that the child leads lack spirit and chemistry, and the adult characters suffer from excessive exposition and flat characterization. While he did praise Sophia Myles&#x27; performance and the vehicle designs, he considered the film an overall failure and gave it two out of five stars. Roger Ebert noted, &quot;You know, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; was going to go on my list of the worst movies of the year, but it just wasn&#x27;t good enough.&quot; On the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 19% &quot;rotten&quot; rating based on 106 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Live-action cartoon for kids.&quot; Critics widely described the film as a second-rate &quot;Spy Kids&quot; imitator.

During development, creator Gerry Anderson was invited to act as creative consultant, but was left out when the studio felt there were enough employees on the payroll acting as part of the creative team. The studio offered him $750,000 (£432,000) to attend the premiere but Anderson could not accept money from people he had not worked for. He eventually saw the film on DVD and was disappointed, declaring &quot;It was disgraceful that such a huge amount of money was spent with people who had no idea what &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; was about and what made it tick.&quot; He also said that it was &quot;the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life&quot;.

Co-creator Sylvia Anderson, and the one responsible for character development, was given a private screening of the film and attended the London premiere. She expressed a far different opinion to that of her former husband, stating &quot;I felt that I&#x27;d been on a wonderful &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; adventure. You, the fans, will I&#x27;m sure, appreciate the sensitive adaptation and I&#x27;m personally thrilled that the production team have paid us the great compliment of bringing to life our original concept for the big screen. If we had made it ourselves (and we have had over 30 years to do it!) we could not have improved on this new version. It is a great tribute to the original creative team who inspired the movie all those years ago. It was a personal thrill for me to see my characters come to life on the big screen.&quot;

Timed to coincide with the theatrical release of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, the two prior films were released on DVD. The DVD versions of all three films include a number of extra features, including historical and production information.

=== Legacy ===
Though &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; has had a negative reputation with many fans of the original franchise, cast members frequently speak about the film having devoted fans, especially those who were children when the film was released. The film is occasionally critically reassessed, and cast members frequently praise their time working on the film; Sophia Myles has said &quot;It was amazing... I only have the fondest of memories of making that film, [and] quite frankly I don&#x27;t really care what anyone else thought... for me it was one of the best times of my life.&quot; Dominic Colenso, who moved to a career as a communications expert, often describes himself as a &quot;Former Thunderbird&quot;.

A 60-foot model of Thunderbird 3, based on Dominic Lavery&#x27;s design for the film, was created by ZenithOptimedia to market the film, and stood in Trafalgar Square close to the film&#x27;s release. It was subsequently displayed in Blackpool (at one point being decorated with images from Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;) until early 2008, when it was purchased by Eastern Airways; at present it remains on display at Humberside Airport.

<text>The Battle of Cut Knife, fought on May 2, 1885, occurred when a flying column of North-West Mounted Police, Canadian militia, and Canadian regulars attacked a Cree and Assiniboine teepee settlement near Battleford in the North-West Territories&#x27; District of Saskatchewan. at the time of the 1885 North-West Rebellion. First Nations fighters forced the Canadian forces to retreat, with losses on both sides.

==Background==

In the spring of 1885, Louis Riel, supported by many Métis living in the District of Saskatchewan, declared a provisional government, taking control of the area around Batoche. Riel was in contact with Cree and Assiniboine bands and other First Nations groups in Saskatchewan and Alberta. The Canadian government was concerned that the resistance would spread to First Nations across the North-West Territories.

The Government of Canada quickly made preparations to send troops to crush the resistance.

Bands of Cree, assembled under the leadership of Poundmaker, went to Battleford. The purpose of the visit was to lobby the Indian agent there, Mr. Rae, for better supplies (many members of the band were starving) and to discuss the political situation. The people of Battleford and some of the settlers in the surrounding area, hearing reports of large numbers of Cree and Assiniboine leaving reserves and making their way to Battleford, feared for their safety. On the night of March 30, 1885, townspeople abandoned the town and gathered for safety at North-West Mounted Police Fort Battleford. When Poundmaker and his party reached the town, Rae refused to come out of the fort to meet with them. He kept them waiting for two days. Poundmaker&#x27;s people meanwhile suffered from hunger, having been refused supplies by Rae.

The abandoned homes and businesses were looted about this time. The identity of the looters is disputed. Some reports claimed Poundmaker&#x27;s people were responsible, but one observer alleged that most of the looting had already been done by whites. Oral history accounts claim that the looting was done by Nakoda people, and that Poundmaker did his best to stop it. Either way, Poundmaker&#x27;s people left the next day.

Meanwhile, bands of Assiniboine living south of Battleford heard about the Métis rebellion. A few of them killed a local farmer who had treated them harshly, and shot their Indian agent for beating a teenage girl. They then went north to Battleford to meet up with Poundmaker. A number of homes and businesses in Battleford were then looted and burned. There is some controversy as to who was responsible and as to the extent of the destruction.

The Canadian government sent Major-General Frederick Middleton to Saskatchewan to organize the suppression of the Métis rebellion. The small police force at Fort Battleford, suddenly responsible for the safety of nearly 500 civilians, and under incipient attack by Native insurgents who were freely moving around outside the fort, called on him for reinforcements and hastily set about forming a home guard to garrison the post. 

Middleton detached a column under the leadership of Lieutenant-Colonel William Otter to relieve Battleford.

Otter&#x27;s column consisted of some 763 men from the 2nd Battalion, &quot;Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada&quot;, &#x27;B&#x27; Battery, Regiment of Canadian Artillery, &#x27;C&#x27; Company of the Infantry School Corps, a party of sharpshooters from the 1st Battalion Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards, a small party of North-West Mounted Police under the command of Percy Neale, and assorted teamsters. The column travelled by rail to Swift Current, then began to march to Battleford on April 13, 

Arriving on April 24, they found hundreds of civilians, white and Métis, crammed into Fort Battleford. Poundmaker&#x27;s followers were absent from the immediate scene but it was thought that Poundmaker and many insurgents were camped on his reserve 45 km northwest of Battleford.

Overjoyed at Otter&#x27;s arrival, the townspeople and settlers wanted revenge on the Indians for the losses in lives and material that they had suffered. Many of Otter&#x27;s troops, inexperienced militiamen, were angry that they had &quot;missed out on a fight&quot;.

Despite orders from General Middleton to stay in Battleford, Otter wired the Lieutenant-Governor of the Northwest Territories (who was also the Indian Commissioner), Edgar Dewdney, for permission to &quot;punish Poundmaker.&quot; Permission was granted. Leaving a garrison in Battleford, Otter led a flying column of 392 men to attack the Cree and Assiniboine at Cut Knife Hill. 

His force was made up of 75 North-West Mounted Police (cavalry), several small units of Canadian army regulars, and various volunteers and militia. He carried with him two 7-pounder field rifles and a Gatling gun. He set out on the afternoon of May 1. His plan was to march until dusk, rest until the moon rose, then continue on to attack the Cree and Assiniboine early in the morning, while they were asleep.
Meanwhile, the Cree were encamped on their reserve west of Battleford, on Cut Knife Creek. They had been joined by various other bands, including Assiniboine. Knowing there were thousands of Canadian soldiers in the area to fight the Métis&#x27; rebellion, they organized to protect themselves. 

As was Cree custom, the war chief Fine Day replaced Poundmaker (the &#x27;political chief&#x27;) as leader until the fighting was over. He ordered the entire encampment to move across Cut Knife Creek to the west side. Behind the camp was Cut Knife Hill, and on both sides of it were ravines filled with bushes and trees. Altogether, the encampment contained nine bands of Cree and three of Assiniboine, numbering some 1500 men, women, and children.

==Battle==
Just after dawn on May 2, Otter&#x27;s column arrived. Otter had expected that the camp would be in the prairie on the east side of Cut Knife Creek. He had not anticipated that he would have to ford the creek. After his leading soldiers crossed the creek, they had to wade through a marsh before they reached the encampment. An old Cree man named Jacob with Long Hair woke up when he heard the sound of the soldiers crossing the creek, and he began to alert the fighters in the camp. 

Colonel Otter set up two cannons and a Gatling gun, and they started firing on the sleeping camp. In the first few minutes, there was total confusion. The gunfire put holes in lodges and destroyed the camp. Women and children ran for the safety of the ravines. A group of Assiniboine warriors charged Otter&#x27;s men to stop them from killing the women and children. The other warriors moved into the ravines, and Fine Day went to the top of Cut Knife Hill to direct the Cree counterattack. 

The defenders fought in small groups. One group would run forward, attack the soldiers, then rush back into a ravine before the soldiers could shoot back at them. As soon as the soldiers tried to attack the Natives on one side, fighters on the other side would rush out of the other ravine and attack them from behind. Meantime, other fighters guarded the women and children by taking on the soldiers at the front toip of he column. 

Otter could not direct the attack because he had little idea where the camp&#x27;s defenders were nor of their numbers. Robert Jefferson, an eyewitness, reported that &quot;not more than 50 [Natives] altogether, had taken part in the battle. This was understandable since few were armed.&quot; Douglas Light&#x27;s research indicates some 243 Cree and Assiniboine men were present, and notes that a number of young boys also took part in the fight.

Otter formed his soldiers into a wedge. Two lines of soldiers and police faced the two ravines. Volunteers and militia guarded the rear, facing the marsh. 

As the battle continued, Fine Day employed a flanking manoeuvre, whereby his fighters began to move along the two ravines, getting closer and closer to the soldiers. The fighters shot from behind trees and bushes, so that Otter&#x27;s men seldom saw anyone to shoot at. 

Eventually, the camp&#x27;s defenders had almost encircled Otter&#x27;s soldiers, and they were bogged down, with ravines on each side and the way out made difficult by the marsh. After six hours of fighting, Otter decided to order a withdrawal. 

As the soldiers crossed the marsh, some of Poundmaker&#x27;s fighters mounted their horses to go in pursuit. Poundmaker asked them to let Otter&#x27;s men leave. They respected Poundmaker and allowed Otter to retreat to Battleford without attack. Some historians believe only Poundmaker&#x27;s actions prevented an outright slaughter of Otter&#x27;s troops.

Note: The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan describes the terrain and initial encounter somewhat differently.

==Aftermath==
Poundmaker and his people did not stay in the area but began to move away before the soldiers could recover and resume the attack. When Poundmaker heard of the Metis defeat at Batoche, he travelled to Battleford to give himself up.

==Conclusion==
The Battle of Cut Knife was the Natives&#x27; most successful battle during the North-West Rebellion. They had the advantage of being on their own territory, but also several disadvantages: they were outnumbered, attacked by surprise, and short on ammunition. Fourteen of Otter&#x27;s soldiers were wounded, and eight killed, including one abandoned to be mutilated by native women; three natives were wounded and five killed, including a Nez Perce who had come north from the United States some years earlier.

The battle instilled in some of Otter&#x27;s men a respect for their enemy. Otter had expected Poundmaker&#x27;s people to be caught off-guard and demoralized and to surrender quickly. But that had not happened.

However, despite suffering their greatest reverse during the campaign, sheer weight of numbers and better supplies favoured the North-West Field Force. In just a few weeks, the starving Cree went to Battleford to make peace with Major-General Middleton. Fine Day, the Cree war chief who had directed the battle, escaped to the United States. Poundmaker was arrested and jailed for seven months. Lieutenant-Colonel William Otter survived the battle and remained a prominent figure in the military, commanding The Royal Canadian Regiment in the Boer War, and acting as Director of Internment Camps in World War I.

Many people have compared this battle to the Battle of the Little Bighorn. There are some major similarities: in both cases, an army officer disobeyed orders; both tried to catch a native camp by surprise; both Custer and Otter badly misjudged the terrain and had to slow down their attacks; and both ended up being surrounded by warriors and had no idea where to charge. Otter, at least, knew when to retreat (and was allowed to do so), while Custer kept fighting and suffered hundreds of casualties. Of course, the battles were very different in their outcome. Whereas Custer himself was killed along with a third of his soldiers, Otter and most of his soldiers survived their battle and emerged with a new respect for native warriors.

==Legacy==

The site of the battle was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1923.

A bronze statue at Cartier Square Drill Hall in Ottawa, Ontario is dedicated to William B. Osgoode and John Rogers, members of the local Guards Company of Sharp-Shooters who were killed during the Battle of Cutknife Hill.

In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck Lake, that &quot;the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples&#x27; struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.&quot;

At Cut Knife is the world&#x27;s largest tomahawk, the Poundmaker Historical Centre and the Big Bear monument. There is also now, correctly located, a cairn erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada upon Cut Knife Hill overlooking the Poundmaker Battle site and Battle River valley.

A government announcement in early May 2019 stated that the Chief Poundmaker, who had been convicted of treason-felony, would be exonerated by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and that a formal apology would be made on 23 May 2019.

<text>Ignacio Gregorio Comonfort de los Ríos (; 12 March 1812 – 13 November 1863), also known as Ignacio Comonfort, was a Mexican politician and soldier who was also president during La Reforma.

He played a leading role in the liberal movement under the Plan of Ayutla to overthrow the dictatorship of Santa Anna in 1855; he then served in the cabinet of the new president, Juan Álvarez. Comonfort was a moderate liberal and assumed the presidency when Álvarez stepped down after only a few months. The Constitution of 1857 was drafted during his presidency, incorporating changes enacted in individual laws of the Liberal Reform. The constitution was met with opposition from conservatives its forceful anticlerical provisions to undermine the economic power and privileged status of the Catholic Church as an institution. Most notably the Lerdo law stripped the Church to hold property. The law also forced the breakup of communal land holdings of indigenous communities, which enabled them to resist integration economically and culturally. The controversy was further inflamed when the government mandated that all civil servants take an oath to uphold the new constitution, which left Catholic public servants with the choice between either keeping their jobs or being excommunicated.

Comonfort considered the anticlerical articles of the constitution too radical, likely to provoke a violent reaction. He also objected to the deliberate weakening of the power of the executive branch of government by empowering the legislative branch. He had been dealing with revolts since the beginning of his administration and the new constitution left the president powerless to act. Hoping to reach compromise with the conservatives and other opponents of the constitution, he joined the Plan of Tacubaya, nullifying the constitution in December 1857. Congress was dissolved and Comonfort remained as president, only to be completely abandoned by his liberal allies. He backed out of the plan and resigned from the presidency. He was succeeded by the president of the Supreme Court, Benito Juárez. Comonfort went into exile as the bloody Reform War broke out, a civil war the conservatives lost in 1861. Comonfort returned to the country in 1862 to fight against the invasion by France that Mexican conservatives supported. Comonfort was killed in action in defense of the Republic on 13 November 1863.

==Early life==
Ignacio Comonfort was born in Puebla on 12 March 1812. His parents were lieutenant colonel Mariano Comonfort and Maria Guadalupe de los Rios. At the age of 14, he began his studies at the Carolino College in Puebla, a school run by Jesuits. He was twenty years old in 1832 when he took part in the liberal revolt which overthrew President Anastasio Bustamante and saw action at San Agustin del Palmar and Puebla. During the subsequent Siege of Mexico City, he was already a captain of the cavalry and fought at Tacubaya, Casas Blancas, Zumpango, San Lorenzo, and Posadas, and gave proof of his great military talent until Bustamante was overthrown and the Zavaleta Accords put an end to the revolution. He was named military commander of Izúcar de Matamoros.

==Centralist Republic of Mexico==
When General Mariano Arista as part of a conservative revolt against the administration of Valentín Gómez Farías besieged Puebla with a vastly superior force, Comonfort defended one of its most exposed points. Arista was repulsed and Comonfort returned to his job as a military commander. In 1834, he returned to defend Puebla against the siege of General Guadalupe Victoria but lost. The victorious conservatives would turn the First Mexican Republic into the Centralist Republic of Mexico Comonfort left the city and returned to his family, where he remained for four years until he was named prefect and military commander of Tlapa in which he made many material improvements. He also had to deal with many southern indigenous revolts within his jurisdiction, including one case in which Comonfort, with twenty-four troops almost without ammunition, sustained a siege against two thousand indigenous troops.

==Involvement in politics==
He was a deputy in Congress in 1842 and 1846. The 1842 Congress was dissolved by Santa Anna and the one in 1846 by Mariano Paredes. Comonfort took part in the revolt against the Paredes government in late 1846, during the early stages of the Mexican–American War which restored the federalist Constitution of 1824. He was elected to the presidency of the third &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; in the capital and was made prefect of western State of Mexico. He participated in the Mexican–American War, occupying the dangerous position of assistant to the commander-in-chief, and was part of the congress that met at Querétaro after the U.S. Army took the capital. He was elected senator the following year in 1848, and later made a customs official in the port of Acapulco, although he was removed from this position during the last dictatorship of Santa Anna in 1854.

==Plan of Ayutla==
Comonfort&#x27;s liberal sympathies, military office, and presence in the South would lead him to play a key role in the Plan of Ayutla, unifying liberal opposition to Santa Anna, formulated by the dissident on 1 March 1854. The plan proclaimed a revolutionary program in the town of Ayutla, Guerrero, condemning the dictatorship of Santa Anna, attacking measures such as military conscription, and the selling of the Mesilla valley to the U.S., known there as the Gadsden Purchase. The plan declared Santa Anna deposed and called for the convocation of a new president and a representative assembly to reorganize the government. The plan was ratified at Acapulco by Colonel Comonfort, among others, with some amendments, including a provision allowing changes to be made in accordance with the national will. Juan Álvarez was chosen as head of the movement.

Comonfort, in charge of the fortress of Acapulco, resisted a siege by Santa Anna who appeared on 20 April 1854, but soon had to retreat. During the revolution, Comonfort went on an important mission abroad to gain war materiel. Comonfort later established his base of operations in Michoacan and prepared to march on Guadalajara. After months of fighting, Santa Anna resigned in August 1855, but Comonfort refused to recognize his government-appointed successor Martin Carrera, whom he viewed as an effort by the remainders of the administration to coopt the revolution. Comonfort entered Guadalajara on 22 August 1855 and published a circular arguing that only Juan Álvarez could be recognized as the leader of the revolution. By September, Comonfort was at Lagos conferring with the independent revolutionary leaders and Manuel Doblado, effecting their recognition of Álvarez&#x27;s leadership. Álvarez assumed the presidency in August.

==Role in Alvarez administration==
===Minister of War===
President Alvarez proceeded to form a cabinet and chose Ignacio Comonfort as Minister of War. Melchor Ocampo was made Minister of Relations, Guillermo Prieto was made Minister of the Treasury, and Benito Juarez of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs. Miguel Lerdo de Tejada was made Minister of Development.

On 16 October, a call was made for a congress to assemble at Dolores Hidalgo in February 1856, to organize the nation under the republican, democratic, and representative form, based upon a decree dating back to the - in 1841. Alvarez would step down before this date, and it was Comonfort who was destined to be president during that fateful session.

Due to the disorder, the military had caused throughout Mexican history, the idea began to be floated in the cabinet of dissolving the military and rebuilding it from the ground. Ocampo and Juarez were in favor while Comonfort was against, wishing instead to reform the military class, but not destroy it. This was just one example of the divisions that existed within the cabinet and Comonfort was publicly perceived as more moderate than his fellow ministers.

Alvarez, who had meanwhile been governing from Cuernavaca, now moved himself and his troops to Mexico City. The filth and brutality of his troops, known as &#x27;pintos&#x27; (mottled ones), caused general disgust and alarm and led to rumors that Alvarez would be overthrown in favor of Comonfort.

===Ley Juárez===

Álvarez&#x27;s cabinet, which included the progressive state governors Benito Juárez and Melchor Ocampo, as well as the writer Guillermo Prieto, represented a new generation of liberals that had come of age since independence in 1821 and intended to pass unprecedented reforms in a period which began with the Álvarez administration and would eventually come to be known as the Liberal Reform. The reforms culminated in a new constitution in 1857, and open conflict with its opponents that did not entirely end until 1867.

They began with the , which passed on 22 November 1855. Ecclesiastical courts were stripped of their right to judge civil law cases involving the Catholic clergy. They were allowed to continue judging clergy under canon law. Opponents of the measure accused government deputies of hypocrisy for claiming to support equality before the law while maintaining their immunity.

The Archbishop protested against the measure and suggested that the question of the ecclesiastical fuero should be submitted to the pope, a suggestion the government rejected. The conservative generals Santa Anna and Blanco were officially stripped of their ranks and the liberals Santos Degollado and Moreno were commissioned as generals. Comonfort was now threatening to resign and only keep the office of general in chief. Álvarez directed his secretaries to lay before him proposals on how to proceed. He also directed his council to prepare a draft of the statute. Meanwhile, the conservatives began to favor the moderate Comonfort for the presidency.

===Assumption of the Presidency===
Alvarez seriously considered stepping down from the presidency and handing it over to Comonfort, but the latter&#x27;s enemies urged Alvarez to stay in office. On 4 December, Alvarez summoned a meeting of the most prominent members of the Liberal party for advice on how to proceed. He wavered on the matter and the following day accepted the resignation of his entire ministry and summoned Luis de la Rosa to organize another. The portfolios would remain empty for the rest of Alvarez&#x27;s presidency.

In Guanajuato, Manuel Doblado pronounced against the government of Juan Alvarez on 6 December, holding up the moderate Ignacio Comonfort as the new president. His proclamation accused Alvarez of attacking religion, the one thing that bound Mexicans together. This proved redundant, as before news of the revolt even reached the capital, the elderly President Alvarez, who was not enjoying administrative tasks or the climate of Mexico City, decided to step down and announced this on 8 December. Alvarez met with Comonfort and officially transferred the presidency to him on 11 December at four o&#x27;clock in the afternoon.

==Presidency==

Comonfort appointed his cabinet two days after he assumed the presidency. Luis de la Rosa was made Minister of Relations, Ezequiel Montes was made Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs, Manuel Siliceo was made Minister of Development, Jose Maria Lafragua was made Minister of Interior Relations, Manuel Payno was made Minister of the Treasury, and Jose Yanez was made Minister of War and Marine.

The ministers outlined their program, which was to avoid any dismemberment of the national territory, as Santa Anna had engaged in with the Gadsden Purchase, avoid civil war, use force only as a last resort, and convoke a constitutional congress at once to frame the constitution, and in the meantime publish an organic statute as a provisional constitution. The government set out to dismantle the remainder of Santa Anna&#x27;s dictatorship. On 9 January 1856, a decree was passed to hold Santa Anna, his ministers, governors and other subordinates responsible for their to the nation and individuals for their illegal acts. Their estates were seized and placed at the disposal of the supreme court to meet damages. The ministry also promised legislation on personal rights, the press, police, the national guard and a moderate approach towards ecclesiastical affairs. Economic measures included opening ports to commerce, opening facilities for commerce, manufacturing, and mining, as well as for education. Foreigners were allowed to own real estate under certain conditions.

===San Luis Potosi revolt===
A revolt now flared up at San Luis Potosí. Over 1,000 men of Rosas Landa&#x27;s brigades returning from Nuevo León under the lead of Manuel Maria Calvo revolted on 10 December 1856, and Rosas Landa was taken prisoner. There were rumors that a group of conservatives were directing these revolts from the capital. There were hostile movements in Michoacan and Tlaxcala, and Tomas Mejia still led troops around . The Indians of Chapala revolted with instigation from Guadalajara. Osollo, pursued by Lamberg, went to San Luis Potosí to assume command of the revolt there.

The government dispatched 4,000 men under which had been organized by the governors of Zacateca and Guanajuato. The insurgents soon found themselves short on resources and filled with dissension. One of their chiefs seized money from a British consul&#x27;s house, but the leaders of the revolt ultimately concluded that they did not have enough men and resources to defend San Luis Potosí, and the city was mostly abandoned. After their evacuation, Parrodi laid siege to them on Magdalena Hill near the town of Cadereita. They retreated on 6 February 1857 and were routed in Tunas Blancas. Colonel Osollo was taken prisoner.

===Puebla revolt===

A revolt broke out in Puebla on 12 December but was shortly taken care of. General Guitian then joined a revolt at Zacapoaxtla against Ley Juarez, though Bishop Labastida advised him to make peace with the government. The first forces sent against them under General Ignacio de la Llave, Colonel Ortega and Lieutenant Colonel Calderon joined the rebels. They were also then joined by Miguel Miramón. Scattered conservative revolts followed in Oaxaca, Zacatecas, Querétaro, and Jalisco.

Under the suspicion of sedition, Comonfort decreed the expulsion from the country of Antonio de Haro y Tamariz, Francisco Pacheco, and . Haro escaped and joined the rebels at Zacapoaxtla, demanding the re-establishment of the Bases Organicas of 1843. The rebels next attacked Puebla on 16 January 1855, and the governor surrendered without a fight. The revolution was now formidable, as the army had four thousand men, abundant supplies, and control of the second-largest city in the republic.

Five thousand troops under generals Villareal, Traconis, Zuloaga, Gayosso, and Moreno marched out of Mexico City on 29 January to suppress the revolt at Puebla. A thousand more men were expected from Guanajuato. Comonfort intended to conduct the operations himself. On 24 February, he had 11,500 men placed in the echelon and 4000 men of the national guard were stationed at the capital. He then set off for the front on 29 February and made his headquarters at Rio Prieto. The insurgents meanwhile retreated within the walls of Puebla.

The Puebla garrison made a sally in force on 8 March, and a battle was fought at half past seven o&#x27;clock in the morning at Ocotlan. After two hours of fighting without any decisive results, Haro asked for a truce, and while he held a conference with Comonfort, Haro&#x27;s troops retreated to Puebla.

On 9 March, Comonfort began a siege which lasted until the 22nd when the insurgents finally surrendered. Comonfort refused to negotiate with Haro and the latter thus handed his command over to Castillo and Guitian, and they to Oronoz, who finally negotiated the surrender. Haro meanwhile escaped and went into hiding. In the final negotiations, the rank-and-file troops were allowed to remain in the government or to retire from service, and the officers were arrested to await their fate.

Orders were issued for Haro&#x27;s arrest. On 31 March, the federal government issued a decree that the governors of Puebla and Veracruz should seize the properties of the church, except those being used for public worship, and sell them to pay for the damages caused by the rebellion.

===Constitutional Congress===

The first meeting of the congress which had been called on 16 October of the previous year under the Alvarez administration, occurred on 14 February. Nothing of substance was passed until the 21st when Alvarez&#x27;s decree transferring executive power to Comonfort was ratified by a majority of 72 votes to 7, thus granting Comonfort a substantial mandate.

The congress was thoroughly progressive, echoing the radical congress of 1833 under Valentín Gómez Farías, but a measure to re-adopt the federalist Constitution of 1824, which had long been championed by the liberals, failed to pass by one vote. Efforts began on a draft of a new constitution.

Congress ratified Ley Juarez and nullified many of the commissions that had been made by Santa Anna.

On 12 May, the Bishop of Puebla was exiled from Mexico for resisting the seizure of church properties. On 5 June, after a secret session, congress voted 70 to 14 to expel Jesuits from the country. Critics of the government accused this measure of hypocritically violating the liberal principle of freedom of religion. Conservatives feared another wave of anti-clerical legislation, as had occurred in 1833.

The government also had to deal with the ever-present financial crisis, as Santa Anna&#x27;s taxes had been lifted and the only source of revenue left was the excise taxes, that northern Governor Vidaurri objected to, duties from customs, which were not substantial, due to a lack of confidence from merchants. The Spanish sent a squadron to the Port of Vera Cruz with representative Miguel de los Santos Alvarez on board, and this was interpreted as a hostile demonstration by nervous merchants.

The organic statute meanwhile had been passed on 15 May. The statue tended toward the centralization of the government by extending the action of the executive over everything, even municipalities. Limits were however placed on this wide authority. The constitutional congress clashed with the president over his claimed power to interfere in the proceedings. Comonfort wished to temper the efforts of the deputies who in response to Santa Anna&#x27;s recent dictatorship, intended to set up a government that Comonfort viewed as too weak.

The draft of the new constitution had its first reading on 16 June, and the consideration of its clauses was begun at once. Like the Constitution of 1824, it embodied many principles borrowed from the Constitution of the United States. The Declaration of the Rights of Man took into consideration the judicial thought and constitutions of the world&#x27;s most advanced nations. Equality before the law was accepted as a fundamental right.

The organization of Coahuila and Nuevo León was now an issue for the government. Governor Santiago Vidaurri had attempted to annex the greater part of Coahuila&#x27;s towns to Nuevo León, but Comonfort on 15 April 1856, declared this act null, a decree that was confirmed by Congress.

Comonfort struggled against both the radical wing of his party and against clerical conservatives, both of which accused the president of conceding too much to the other.

===Ley Lerdo===
In June 1856, another major controversy emerged over the promulgation of the Ley Lerdo, named after the secretary of the treasury. The law was aimed at the collective ownership of the real estate. It forced &#x27;civil or ecclesiastical institutions&#x27; to sell any land that they owned, with the tenants getting priority and generous terms for buying the land that they lived on. It was mostly aimed at the church, but the law was also aimed at Mexico&#x27;s native communities who were forced to sell their communal lands, the ejidos.

On 1 July, Archbishop Garza protested to the government that the properties were likely to be bought by a few rich individuals, argued that the church had previously lent to the government during crises, and defended the church&#x27;s record of treating tenants more generously than private owners. Minister of Interior and Foreign Relations Montez received him courteously, but his protests did not change government policy. The law was designed to develop Mexico&#x27;s economy by increasing the number of private property owners, but in practice, the land was bought up by rich speculators. Most of the lost indigenous land went to haciendas.

===New Constitution===

Meanwhile, the drafting of the new constitution continued amidst the opposition of the conservative press as well as opposition within the committee assigned to the task, two of whose members had given a dissenting vote on the current draft. Two other members approved it with reservations, and another declined to sign it. Many members of Congress advocated the revival of the Constitution of 1824, while the distinguished statesman Luis de la Rosa also opposed the new constitution, congress as a whole approved it, 93 to 5.

A debate on religious freedom began on 29 July, with 106 deputies present and a large crowd in the galleries. It lasted until 5 August when it decided not to put the article to a vote. Ultimately religious freedom would not make it into the constitution, but neither would an article making Mexico a confessional state as in previous constitutions, thus resulting in a type of de facto religious freedom.

The constitutional congress wrapped up its work on 5 February 1857, and the fundamental code was signed and its support swore to by each congressman after which President Comonfort swore an oath to observe the constitution. After this, both Congress and the president addressed the nation and the new constitution was promulgated by Comonfort on 12 February. On that day the government also issued a comprehensive electoral law with 67 articles. The constitution was not meant to come into force until 16 September. Before the end of the year, Comonfort himself would have disavowed the constitution and civil war would have broken out.

The constitutional congress closed its session on 17 February and Comonfort in the meantime passed laws establishing a civil state register and government-run cemeteries.

===Oath to the Constitution===
On 17 March 1857, it was decreed that all civil servants had to publicly swear and sign an oath to the constitution. The Catholic Church decreed ex-communication for anyone that took the oath, and subsequently, many Catholics in the Mexican government lost their jobs for refusing the oath.

The Franco-Mexican liberal paper Trait d&#x27;Union (Hyphen) proclaimed that war had been declared between church and state and featured stories on who had refused the oath, including judges and other federal civil servants. The press noted many cases of minor and local officials also refusing the oath. Others retracted their oaths to be able to receive the sacraments during Lent, which had begun that year shortly after the decree requiring an oath.

Liberal officials however struck back at opposition to the oath and the constitution. Governor Juarez of Oaxaca expelled all priests who refused Christian burial to supporters of the constitution. In Aguascalientes, Governor Lopez de Nava also cracked down on those refusing to take the oath by depriving them of political rights. Governor Alatiste of Puebla outright ordered public prayers for the success of the constitutional authorities.

===Leadup to the War of Reform===

The clergy of Puebla were resolved to obstruct at all hazards the execution of the Lerdo Law, whereupon the government adopted stringent measures. The sale of the property went on though slowly owing to conscientious objectors and fear of political persecution by others and the government exiled both military officers and ecclesiastics charged with sedition. On the night of 15 September, many Franciscans were arrested and their convent was occupied by troops, and on the 17th the government decreed the suppression of the convent and the seizure of all its property except the main church and chapels, sacred vessels ornaments, relics, and images which were handed over to the archbishop.

Ezequiel Montes was dispatched in early October to Rome by the government to try to convince the pope to agree on the constitution. The archbishop was asked by the government to restrain the clergy who were urging disobedience to the government. Comonfort accepted the resignation of Puebla governor Traconis and replaced him with the more moderate Jose Maria Garcia Conde.

The clerical uprisings did not make up the only insurgency that Comonfort had to deal with, as Governor Santiago Vidaurri of Nuevo León had revolted on the northern frontier, seizing Saltillo and Matehuala. Nearly all of the nation&#x27;s available troops had to be sent to the north to deal with Vidaurri&#x27;s uprising.

The garrison of Querétaro City on 13 October fell into the hands of the conservative officer Tomas Mejia. The rebels, in addition to the usual conservative cause of &#x27;religion y fueros&#x27; also promised the Indians to protect their landed property which had also been targeted by the Ley Lerdo.

Another revolt flared up in Puebla City on 20 October when Colonel Joaquin Orihuela and Lieutenant Colonel Miguel Miramon led by Father , seized the artillery and the ammunition, arrested the governor, commandant general and demanded an end to the Juarez and Lerdo Laws. The prisoners were later liberated in a rescue by lieutenant colonel Diaz Quijano.

The revolts united Congress behind the president and acquiesced to Comonfort&#x27;s request for emergency powers, granting him a vote of confidence joined in even by the progressive hardliners whom Comonfort had previously clashed with. A commission was named to negotiate with Vidaurri&#x27;s government in Nuevo León.

Forces were dispatched against Puebla led by General Tomas Moreno, and reinforced with troops from Tlaxcala until the total forces amounted to over 4,000 men under General Traconis, Felix Zuloaga, Trias, and Emilio Langberg. Operations planned to capture not destroy the rebels, and they only numbered 200, but they made an unexpected defense, sustained by a belief that sympathetic movements were breaking out all over the country, which they did to a limited extent. The besieged conservatives finally surrendered on November 29, though Miramon and Orihuela managed to escape.

A ministerial crisis led to the appointment of a new ministry, more moderate whose head was the Minister of Relations, Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada. Angonio Garcia was made Minister of Justice, and Amarcelino Castaneda was made Minister of Government and was shortly succeeded by Jesus Teran. Comonfort vacillated back and forth between the moderate party and the radical party wondering if it was prudent or not in carrying out all of the constitution&#x27;s unprecedented reforms.

The opposition press now began to advocate that Comonfort continue ruling with extraordinary powers rather than allow the constitution to come into force, though the majority of the liberals did not take seriously the notion that Comonfort would join such a scheme.

The government&#x27;s problems were now complicated by the Spanish refusal to accept the Mexican plenipotentiary La Fragua and made suggestions that the Spanish government intended to interfere in Mexico. A minor war scare flared up and applications to join the national guard surged.

Another ministerial crisis on 15 September led to the entire cabinet resigning and the ministries being left in charge of the chief clerks. Comonfort&#x27;s emergency powers had now ended, a newly elected congress was not yet meeting, and the country was rife with insurrections. Businesses in the capital closed up and troops patrolled the streets.

Congress was installed on 8 October and Comonfort soon requested emergency powers to deal with the insurgencies. Congress denied the request, and many of the deputies disagreed that the situation demanded it. Comonfort remained determined to seek the necessary executive powers. Congress conceded by granting emergency powers to the state governors and on 3 November suspended certain articles of the constitution impeding Comonfort&#x27;s ability to suppress rebellion: namely those on freedom of speech, assembly, bearing arms, and due process. Congress meanwhile counted the votes for the presidential elections which had been held earlier in the year, with Comonfort receiving a majority. Comonfort officially assumed the executive on 1 December 1857. In his inaugural address, he asked the representatives to amend the constitution, insisting that he had a respectful record of supporting liberal causes.

===Plan of Tacubaya===

The conservative conspirators were now sounding out the support of the governors for a plan to suppress Congress and restore Comonfort&#x27;s emergency powers. Members of Comonfort&#x27;s government, Minister Payno and General Félix María Zuloaga were accused of plotting against the constitution, which caused much displeasure in Congress, but finally, Zuloaga was indicted. After arranging with certain governors, the conspirators in a suburb of Mexico City declared the Plan of Tacubaya on the morning of 17 December to set aside the national constitution. The supreme control of the government was to be entrusted to Ignacio Comonfort who was to convoke within three months another constitutional congress for framing another constitution more in line with the national will, to be submitted to a national plebiscite and in the event of its non-acceptance to be returned to the congress for an amendment. The president was to rule with a consultative council composed of one representative from each state.

On 17 December, congress made a solemn protest against the Plan of Tacubaya and declared that Comonfort&#x27;s authority had now ended. Zuloaga&#x27;s brigade occupied the capital and dissolved the congress. Benito Juárez, president of the Supreme Court and Isidoro Olvera, president of the Congress were arrested. The ayuntamiento of Mexico City was also dissolved. On 19 December, Comonfort officially announced that he had accepted the Plan of Tacubaya. He released a manifesto explaining his motives, expounding that he viewed the Plan of Tacubaya as an opportunity for a moderate compromise and viewing the alternative as anarchy.

Seventy deputies reassembled in Querétaro and aired their protests. A council of state was installed on 25 December in which skeptical voices opined that it was impossible to bring about the reconciliation that Comonfort sought. On 30 December the strategic state of Vera Cruz abandoned the Plan of Tacubaya, convincing Comonfor that his new government&#x27;s position was precarious.

===Resignation===
Comonfort now sought to move away from the government he had helped bring to power. He made known to troops in the interior his repentance of having supported the Plan of Tacubaya and to surrender the executive over to the president of the Supreme Court. He thought at one point of even joining the troops to fight against the reactionists. His ruling council now advised him to make a complete retraction. Minister of War Garcia Conde proposed a conference of state governors to reconcile the country, but it was rejected.

On the morning of 11 January, more troops near the capital joined the Plan of Tacubaya. Comonfort resolved to go with 5,000 loyal troops to the headquarters of the constitutionalists. He intended to step down from the government and hand over the presidency to his constitutional successor, the president of the Supreme Court, who was Benito Juarez. Comonfort released him from his imprisonment, and Juarez left for Guanajuato where on 19 January, he established a government.

==Exile, return and death==

After being advised by Generals Rangel and Pardo that resistance in the capital was futile, Comonfort sought to abandon the city on the morning of 22 January. The conservative general, Parra, allowed him to leave the city and he headed for the liberal-controlled state of Vera Cruz. On 7 February, he disembarked on the steamer Tennessee and headed towards Europe with his family.

In 1861, he was living in Texas and sought through the intermediary of Santiago Vidaurri, permission to return to Mexico. Vidaurri allowed him to reside in Monterrey. The government at first ordered his arrest but then accepted his services as the French Intervention began.

Comonfort had to deal with recently conscripted troops unsuited to stand a fair chance against the French and he was defeated on 8 May 1863, at the Battle of San Lorenzo, retreating to Mexico City. Comonfort followed the national government when it retreated from the capital on 31 May 1863, and he was even made Minister of War.

On 13 November, he was heading from San Luis Potosí to Guanajuato when he was killed in a surprise attack between Chamacuero and Celaya at the Soria Mill, by a party under the command of Chief Gonzales Aguirre. His corpse was taken to San Miguel de Allende, and after the republic was restored in 1867 his ashes were taken to the cemetery of San Fernando.

<text>Jennette Arnold, OBE is a Labour Co-op politician who served as chair of the London Assembly for five terms. From 2004 to 2021, Arnold represented the North East constituency, comprising the London Boroughs of Hackney, Islington and Waltham Forest.
==Background==
Born in Montserrat, Arnold trained as a nurse. She then worked as an Industrial Relations Officer and as Regional Director of Services and Special Adviser (Equalities) to the General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing. She then worked as an associate for organisational development consultancy, Beacon Associates.

Arnold was elected to Islington Council in 1994, eventually serving a term as deputy mayor. On the creation of the Greater London Authority in 2000, she was included on Labour&#x27;s Londonwide list for the London Assembly, but missed out on a spot. Following the resignation of David Lammy prompted by his election as a Member of Parliament, Arnold as next in line on Labour&#x27;s list became a Londonwide member of the Assembly in July 2000. She was subsequently selected as Labour&#x27;s candidate for the North East constituency and elected in the 2004 Assembly election.

Arnold served as Chair of the London Assembly for five terms. She was the London Assembly Labour Group&#x27;s lead spokesperson on education and Chair of the London Assembly&#x27;s Education Panel. Arnold previously chaired the Cultural Strategy Group for London, playing a role in bringing the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games to London. She has also sat on the Assembly&#x27;s Economic and Social Development Committee and served as a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority.

During her time in the Assembly, Arnold campaigned on issues including the provision of education for young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and the improvement of services on the Gospel Oak to Barking line. She also campaigned extensively on the eradication of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), often citing witnessing a victim of FGM during her time as a student nurse as what prompted her to take action.

In 2007 Arnold was listed by &quot;New Nation&quot; newspaper as one of Britain&#x27;s 50 most influential black women.

A member of the UK delegation on the European Committee of the Regions, Arnold is currently: a council member of the Royal Court Theatre; a governor of the Museum of London; a governor of Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre Foundation, a patron of the Victoria Climbie Foundation, and a former Chair of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust.

During the 2015 Labour Party leadership election Arnold endorsed Jeremy Corbyn.

In January 2019 Arnold announced in a statement to the Assembly that she would not be standing in the 2020 London Assembly election. In May 2020, she stepped down as chair and was replaced by Navin Shah. However, with the deferral of the election by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she continued as an AM until the 2021 London Assembly election.

<doc id="469028" wikidata="Q2292272" url="?curid=469028" title="Skies of Arcadia">
<text>Skies of Arcadia is a 2000 role-playing video game developed by Overworks and published by Sega for the Dreamcast. Players control Vyse, a young air pirate, and his friends as they attempt to stop the Valuan Empire from reviving ancient weapons with the potential to destroy the world.

&quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; uses traditional Japanese role-playing game systems such as turn-based battles and experience points, but puts greater focus on exploration, with the player flying an airship in 3D space. The development team included staff who had contributed to the &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot;, &quot;Phantasy Star&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series.

&quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; received critical acclaim upon release and is frequently regarded as one of the best games for the Dreamcast, although the game underperformed commercially. A port for the GameCube, Skies of Arcadia Legends, was released in 2002.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; is a role-playing video game (RPG) with an emphasis on world exploration. Gameplay is similar to early 3D &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games; the player engages enemies in turn-based battles to earn experience points, making their characters stronger. The overworld is divided into six regions, traversed by flying airships in 3D space; &quot;Discoveries,&quot; hidden locations, reward the player with extra benefits. The world map starts out blank, and it is up to the player to chart the map through exploration. The player may also recruit characters they encounter in exploration, allowing them to be placed on the ship or base&#x27;s staff, adding extra benefits to exploration or battle.

When docked on landmasses or warships, exploration occurs on foot. There, gameplay alternates between exploring cities and progressing through the game&#x27;s dungeons. Cities are visited to buy equipment to make characters stronger, and interact with non-playable characters to progress the story. The dungeons exist in the format of a maze, with the player navigating the characters through it to obtain beneficial items in treasure chests while taking on enemies in random battles. Getting through the end of the maze generally culminates in a last boss battle to be won prior to exiting. The battle system involves managing &quot;Spirit Points,&quot; &quot;Magic Points,&quot; and a multi-colored &quot;Moon Stone&quot; system.

==Plot==

===Setting===
The game takes place in the fictional skies referred to as Arcadia, where six civilizations coexist on floating continents orbited by six moons of different colors. Thousands of years prior to the present time of the game, the civilizations, one of which existed for each moon, developed technologically to the point where each created a Gigas, a colossal living weapon of mass destruction, controlled by a Moon Crystal. Using the Gigas, the civilizations warred with one another, threatening the extinction of humanity. The most advanced, the Silver Civilization, used their Gigas to summon the Rains of Destruction, which pulled meteors from the orbiting moons and crashed them down onto the planet&#x27;s surface. The catastrophic destruction stopped the rampage of the Gigas, as well as nearly destroyed the other five civilizations, thus ending the war. A seal was placed on the Silver Gigas to prevent it from being used again, and the Moon Crystals were hidden away, while each civilization worked on rebuilding itself.

==== Characters ====
The player primarily controls Vyse, as part of a party of up to four characters. The other two main characters, Aika and Fina, are mandatory characters for the party through most of the game. The final spot in the group is filled by one of three other playable characters—Drachma, Gilder and Enrique—dictated either by story events, or the player&#x27;s choice. An additional twenty-two minor characters are recruitable to fill various roles on Vyse&#x27;s airship, though they remain there, and do not follow Vyse&#x27;s party.

===Story===
Vyse and Aika are members of the Blue Rogues, a faction of Robin Hood-minded air pirates gathered together to resist the militant and tyrannical Valuan Empire. Led by Empress Teodora, the empire seeks the Moon Crystals to reawaken the Gigas and take over the world. Teodora directs the Valuan Armada, a fleet of warships led by admirals Galcian and Ramirez, to find them. Upon the Silver Civilization learning of this plan, they send Fina to find the Moon Crystals first. She is captured by the Armada, but saved by Vyse and Aika, who, with mutual enemies, agree to help her mission.

Hitching a ride with an old fisherman, Drachma, and his ship, the trio recover the Red Moon Crystal from a temple in the desert nation of Nasr and the Green Moon Crystal high above Ixa&#x27;taka, a continent of lush forests, while foiling Valuan operations. When Drachma&#x27;s ship is damaged in a Valuan attack, Vyse is stranded on the small Crescent Island, where he uncovers letters and a map left behind by another pirate seeking treasure. Vyse is found by a fellow Blue Rogue, Gilder, who takes him aboard to search for his friends. Aika and Fina end up in the care of another Blue Rogue, Clara, who takes them to Nasr to help search for Vyse. Aika and Fina find out about the same treasure Vyse learned of, and the three reunite, but are captured by Ramirez and brought to the Valuans&#x27; prison fortress. By enlisting the Valuan prince Enrique, who has lost patience with his government&#x27;s tyranny, and stealing a powerful Valuan warship, the &quot;Delphinus&quot;, the Blue Rogues escape. Vyse brings everyone back to Crescent Island, where he establishes a base of operations for his crew.

The party recovers the Blue Moon Crystal from the eastern Oriental land of Yafutoma and the Purple Moon Crystal from the southern glacial content of Glacia. After obtaining the Yellow Moon Crystal from the Valuan continent, they retrieve Fina&#x27;s captured ship, which she needs to bring the Moon Crystals to the Silver Civilization in an immense shrine that orbits Arcadia. Ramirez&#x27;s fleet assaults the Blue Rogues and he steals their Moon Crystals. Vyse, Aika, Fina and Gilder travel to the Great Silver Shrine in orbit to confer with the elders; they are followed by Galcian and Ramirez, who assassinate the leader of the Silvite elders and from his body extract the final Moon Crystal.

Galcian and Ramirez use the Moon Crystals to raise the lost Silver continent of Soltis and break the seal on the Silver Gigas. They use the Rains of Destruction to annihilate the Valuan capital, killing Empress Teodora and seizing control of the Valuan Armada in a bid to dominate the world. Vyse rallies a fleet of Blue Rogues, Yafutoman warships, and ships from other regions of the world to battle the Valuan Armada. The &quot;Delphinus&quot; crew disables the &quot;Hydra&quot;, Galcian&#x27;s capital ship, and boards the ship and defeat Galcian, with assistance from Galcian&#x27;s subordinate Belleza, who turns on him and kills them both.

Ramirez, who has retreated into Soltis, is enraged at Galcian&#x27;s death, and prepares to use the Rains of Destruction to wipe out the Blue Rogues. He is stopped by the Silvites, who sacrifice their lives to take down the protective shield around Soltis. The party enters Soltis and battle Ramirez, who merges with the Silver Gigas, Zelos, allowing it to awaken. Returning to the &quot;Delphinus&quot;, Vyse and his crew do battle with Zelos and manage to defeat it. The party rushes to the outer deck, where a chunk of Zelos, merged with Ramirez and controlling him, slams onto the &quot;Delphinus&quot;″ deck. They battle, resulting in Ramirez&#x27;s death and the defeat of the Valuan Armada. Enrique, the prince of Valua, marries the princess of Yafutoma and becomes emperor of Valua. With a promise of benevolent rule, he and his wife oversee the reconstruction of the Valuan capital. Vyse and Aika inaugurate Fina as a Blue Rogue, and the three sail into the sunset.

==Development==

Development began in 1999 under the code name &quot;Project Ares&quot;. The title was changed to &quot;Eternal Arcadia&quot; in 2000, retained for the Japanese release. The internal Sega development team, Overworks, consisted of development staff from Team Andromeda and from the &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; development teams. Producer Rieko Kodama had worked on &quot;Phantasy Star 1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;4&quot;, and the first two &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games for the Sega Genesis, while scenario writer Shuntaro Tanaka had written the stories for the first two &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; RPGs. The soundtrack was composed by Yutaka Minobe and Tatsuyuki Maeda; Maeda had composed music for &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot;. Expectations were high, as Team Andromeda&#x27;s prior game, &quot;Panzer Dragoon Saga&quot; (1998), had received critical acclaim, and the Dreamcast had few well-reviewed JRPGs.

Development went smoothly, attributed to the increased power and easier architecture of the Dreamcast in comparison to the Sega Saturn. The team was made up of a staff of around 20 people. The team made conscious decisions to make entering individual buildings in towns seamless, without loading, and to use an expressive, anime art style to more clearly show facial expressions and emotions of characters, both of which they felt had been lacking from recent popular RPGs such as &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. Similarly, while the aforementioned games were focused on dark themes and complicated gameplay systems, Overworks strove to keep the game bright and cheerful, with simple gameplay mechanics that focused on exploring a large game world. The game was released across two of Sega&#x27;s proprietary GD-ROM discs, to accommodate its size.

Development began for the Sega Saturn, with battles on land and the tops of trains. After production moved to the Dreamcast, the motif of traveling the skies was set, inspired by the Age of Discovery. At the time, Japanese role-playing video games portrayed mostly darker worlds, but Overworks was more interested in creating an optimistic protagonist who explored the world. They took care to portray Aika and Fina, Vyse&#x27;s female friends, on equal footing with him, rather than being saved by him. The historical architecture and ancient civilizations are attributed to team member Shuntaro Tanaka, who majored in history at university and conceptualized the world and scenario, inspiring the &quot;discovery&quot; aspect.

The Japanese Dreamcast release date was set for September 14, 2000, but delayed to October 5, 2000, so the team could create a paid &quot;trial version&quot; for concurrent release. The release was promoted in Japan with posters and television commercials. During launch month, and spanning eight months total, the game also received an official manga in every issue of &quot;Magazine Z&quot;, supervised by the development team. A soundtrack was released on CD on the day of the game&#x27;s released.

===Localization===
&quot;Eternal Arcadia&quot; was renamed &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; for its Western releases, which Sega felt better expressed the premise and story to Western audiences. It was localized by Chris Lucich and Klayton Vorlick. The two were given the freedom to change the game content for Western audiences, though Sega of Japan held the right to veto their changes. While the game still follows the same general plotline from the Japanese game, much of the dialogue was entirely rewritten. The two did a rough translation of the entire game from Japanese to English, and then completely deleted the Japanese from their records, choosing to write the subsequent and final drafts without referencing the original text. Vorlick completely rewrote the dialogue for Enrique, Vigoro and Fina, while Lucich rewrote Gilder and Aika, and the two co-wrote for Vyse. Speech patterns expected to be annoying to Western audiences, such as the repetitive nature of Fina saying , were removed, while more interesting speech patterns, quirks and jokes, were given many of the rest of the characters. The two were influenced by the work of Joss Whedon, adding many dry, sarcastic responses to the dialogue that had been more straightforward exchanges in the original Japanese script. Many side characters and weapons were renamed after members of the localization and quality assurance team.

Some more mature content was edited; the two scaled back on references to Aika being assaulted by Vigoro when captured by him, and of references to Ramirez obsessively talking about Galcian in later scenes of the game. All traces of cigarettes are removed, shops serve Loqua juice instead of alcohol, and the female character Bellena&#x27;s attire is altered to be less revealing. The localization was completed in four months, with 80- to 100-hour work weeks, on a script of over 2,000 pages. &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; was released in English in North America on November 14, 2000, and in English, German, French and Spanish in Europe on April 21, 2001.

===&quot;Skies of Arcadia Legends&quot; port===
In October 2001, shortly after Sega&#x27;s announcement that it would abandon the Dreamcast to make software for other consoles, Sega announced that it would port &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; to GameCube and PlayStation 2. US developer Point of View Software was brought on to help with the conversion, though the original staff from Overworks continued to work on the game. Development was announced to begin in January 2002, with Sega initially aiming for a mid-2002 release. However, by April, Sega announced that the PS2 version would be delayed, and by May, rumors spread that it had been cancelled, though this was refuted by Sega. In August 2002, Sega announced that the PS2 version was cancelled in favor of focusing on the GameCube release, which was, as of October 2002, 80% complete. &quot;Skies of Arcadia Legends&quot; was released on the GameCube in Japan on December 26, 2002, in North America on January 28, 2003, and in Europe on May 23, 2003, with Infogrames distributing for the latter territory. A port for Windows was announced in early 2004, but never released.

Sega and Kodama have described &quot;Legends&quot; as a &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot;. It partially uses the original game&#x27;s code, and partially uses newly written code for the GameCube. It features improvements such as slightly more detailed character models, a more stable frame rate, reduced loading times, new side quests and subplots, new hidden discoveries, and a &quot;Wanted List&quot; of new enemies to find. It also has fewer random encounters, and awards more experience points in battle to compensate. With the GameCube lacking the Dreamcast&#x27;s VMU, some effects, such as Cupil’s notifications, were moved to the television screen, while the &quot;Pinta Quest&quot; minigame was removed outright. With the GameCube being less readily connected to the internet, the downloadable content was implemented into the main game.

==Reception==
&quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; received &quot;universal acclaim&quot; according to the review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 33 out of 40.

A reviewer of &quot;GameFan&quot; gave it 99%, calling it &quot;By far my favorite RPG of all time thanks to its great story, looks, and battle system. The game has absorbed my days and nights with swashbuckling adventures -- and that&#x27;s all you can really ask for in the end, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; praised the game for being &quot;One of the most solid games visually on the Dreamcast&quot; and concluded that &quot;There&#x27;s so much to explore, so much character, and a great story that you don&#x27;t mind being retold again&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the visuals, stating that they were &quot;some of the most painstakingly detailed ever seen in a role-playing game&quot;. As a whole, &quot;GameSpot&quot; concluded that the game &quot;lives up [to] the high expectations&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; gave the game eight out of ten, saying, &quot;Gripping to the nines, extraordinary to behold, with rich character development and innumerable statistics, &quot;Skies Of Arcadia&quot; is a wonderful experience, and bodes well for all 128bit RPGs to come.&quot; Jeff Lundrigan of &quot;NextGen&quot; wrote, &quot;Despite the problems—which it shares with practically every other Japanese RPG—&quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; is an impressive, thoroughly delightful game that no one should pass up.&quot;

Four-Eyed Dragon of &quot;GamePro&quot; called it &quot;a Dreamcast role-playing game worth playing to the very end. Despite some small blemishes, &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; won&#x27;t disappoint during your flight through the role-playing skies.&quot;

Despite the generally positive reviews, many critics noted that it was sometimes difficult to explore the game&#x27;s world due to the game&#x27;s high rate of random encounter-based battles frequently disrupting progress. Neither version of &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; sold well.

The game was a finalist for the &quot;Best Dreamcast Game&quot; and &quot;Best Role-Playing Game&quot; awards at &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best and Worst of 2000 Awards, both of which went to &quot;NFL 2K1&quot; and &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, respectively. During the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; in the &quot;Character or Story Development&quot;, &quot;Console Role-Playing&quot;, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Game of the Year&quot; categories; all were ultimately awarded to &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, &quot;SSX&quot; and &quot;Diablo II&quot;, respectively. The game was also nominated for the &quot;Best Console RPG&quot; and &quot;Best New Game Character&quot; (Vyse) awards at &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s Blister Awards 2000, both of which went to &quot;Valkyrie Profile&quot; and Ulala from &quot;Space Channel 5&quot;, respectively.

&quot;Game Informer&quot; later listed it as one of the top 10 Dreamcast games. In a 2017 retrospective from Metacritic on the highest-rated exclusive games (at time of release) per platform, &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; placed third for the Dreamcast, behind &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; and &quot;Jet Grind Radio&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Time Extension&quot; included the game on their &quot;Best JRPGs of All Time&quot; list.

===GameCube port===
The GameCube release, &quot;Skies of Arcadia Legends&quot;, received slightly less positive reviews. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 32 out of 40. Fennec Fox of &quot;GamePro&quot; stated that &quot;there&#x27;s no need to harp on the battles too much---they&#x27;re the only blemish on what&#x27;s otherwise the Dreamcast&#x27;s (and now GameCube&#x27;s) best RPG. The graphics are dated but effective, and the musician was obviously overdosing on 1930s adventure serials when composing the over-the-top score. The story, though, is the best part---Vyse and crew are the most extroverted RPG heroes ever, and there&#x27;s none of that &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;-style self-abhorrence present. Get over the battles, and you&#x27;ll find &quot;Skies&quot; dangerously playable.&quot; &quot;GameZone&quot; gave it a score of nine out of ten, saying, &quot;The main problem with this game is that it feels a little dated, especially when you compare it to &quot;FFX&quot; or other games coming out shortly. Other than that it is a great game.&quot;

A common source of the lower scores were the game&#x27;s graphics, with criticism coming from the fact that they had not been substantially improved despite more powerful hardware and over two years passing from the Dreamcast&#x27;s release. Expectations in graphics had changed drastically in between releases—while the Dreamcast release was frequently compared to the weaker original PlayStation and &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;VIII&quot; and &quot;IX&quot;, by the time of the GameCube release, the game was compared against the likes of the much more powerful PlayStation 2 and its games like &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;Xenosaga&quot;

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best GameCube game of January 2003.

==Legacy==
===Cancelled entries===
In addition to the cancelled PlayStation 2 and PC releases of the game, a sequel to the game was considered by Sega in the early 2000s, but did not begin full production. The development team had shown interest in creating a sequel, or a portable iteration for the Game Boy Advance during the development of &quot;Legends&quot; for the GameCube, but neither materialized. In September 2002, after the completion of &quot;Legends&quot;, &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; producer Rieko Kodama stated that the team was still interested in creating a sequel, but that work had still not started on it, though had it started, she felt that the GameCube would have been the most likely platform for its release. In February 2003, Overworks president Noriyoshi Ohba announced that a &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; sequel had entered the planning stages. However, in a December 2004 interview, Kodama stated that while there had been plans for a sequel, the project was put on hold indefinitely while many members of the team were pulled into working on &quot;Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love&quot;.

Starting in 2010, Sega began a campaign of releasing HD remasters of Dreamcast games digitally on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, including games such as &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot;, &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; and &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot;. In 2012, Sega brand manager Ben Harborne stated that a &quot;Skies of Arcadia HD&quot; was a likely next release, after &quot;Shenmue&quot;, as they were the most frequently requested titles for re-release. Sega renewed the &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; trademark later in the same year, though a re-release did not materialize. As recently as 2020, main developer staff Kenji Hiruta expressed interest in returning to the series as well.

===In other media===
&quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot; characters have appeared in Sega properties. Multiple characters from the game later appeared in Sega&#x27;s 2008 video game &quot;Valkyria Chronicles&quot;, another title directed by Shuntaro Tanaka. &quot;Vyse Inglebard&quot; and &quot;Aika Thompson&quot; appear as optional members of Squad 7 and are listed on each other&#x27;s &quot;Like&quot; list. Fina also appears as one of several identical sisters who serve as the squad&#x27;s unplayable medics. The three also appeared in the Japan-only &quot;Valkyria Chronicles III&quot; in 2011 as well. Vyse and Fina made minor cameos in some of the accompanying &quot;Valkyria Chronicles&quot; anime as well. Outside of the &quot;Valkyria&quot; games, Vyse has also made some appearances in some &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; related media. He is a playable character in 2012 Sega racing game &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;, which also features a racetrack based on &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot;, where the participants must drive and fly through the Blue Rogue&#x27;s home-base while eluding attacks from the Valuan Empire. Vyse also appears in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic book adaptation of &quot;Transformed&quot; featured in &quot;Sonic Universe&quot; #45, and again in the &quot;Sonic&quot; comics for the &quot;World Unite&quot; Sega character crossover story arc.

<doc id="469029" wikidata="Q6221877" url="?curid=469029" title="John Biggs (London politician)">
<text>John Robert Biggs (born 19 November 1957) is a British Labour Co-op politician who was Mayor of Tower Hamlets between 2015 and 2022.

Biggs was first elected to Tower Hamlets London Borough Council in 1988 where he served as a Councillor for St Katharine&#x27;s Ward and later St Dunstan&#x27;s Ward until 2002. He was selected as Leader of the Labour Group in 1991, and became a Council Leader in 1994 following a landslide election win.

In 2000, he successfully ran for the City and East Constituency London Assembly seat. Over the course of a 16-year career in the Assembly he served as a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority, London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, London Health Commission, Deputy Chair of the London Development Agency, Deputy Chair of the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation, Chair of Transport, Chair of Planning and Spatial Development, Chair of Regeneration, Chair of the London Assembly Budget Committee, and Chair of the GLA Audit Committee.

He was elected Mayor of Tower Hamlets in 2015, and reelected in 2018. In 2007 he was made an Honorary Fellow of Queen Mary University, and of Birkbeck College in 2016.

==Early life and education==
He was educated at Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s School, Barnet and graduated from the University of Bristol in 1979 having studied chemistry. He then studied Computer Science at Birkbeck College, University of London, and later studied law at the University of Westminster while serving as a Councillor.

He served as an elected politician in London, in Tower Hamlets and East London between 1988 and 2022. In his 20s, Biggs worked as a Systems Analyst in the City of London. Later, he was director of the Labour affiliated Socialist Health Association from 1997 to 2000.

He is an Honorary Fellow of Queen Mary University (2007) and Birkbeck College (2016).

==Tower Hamlets Council==
Biggs was elected to Tower Hamlets London Borough Council in 1988, first as councillor for St Katharine&#x27;s Ward, and Later St Dunstan&#x27;s Ward until 2002. He was selected as the Labour Group leader in 1991, during the period the council was Liberal Democrat controlled (1986–1994).

He led Labour to a landslide victory in 1994, leading the campaign to remove the UK&#x27;s first BNP councillor, and the populist but discredited Liberal Democrat administration.

After standing down as leader in 1995, he remained an active councillor but also attended Law School, served as Director of the Socialist Health Association (1997–2000), and was Deputy Chair of Bow Housing Action Trust (1995–2004).

==London Assembly==

Biggs represented City and East Constituency at City Hall between 2000 and 2016, during the tenures of Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson. 
Under Ken Livingstone&#x27;s, initially independent mayoralty, relationships were frosty due in part to the circumstances of Livingstone&#x27;s election and his subsequent support for Lutfur Rahman, but improved with time.

As Assembly Member between 2000 and 2008 he was appointed Deputy Chairman of the London Development Agency (2004–2008) and served on the Metropolitan Police Authority (2000–2003), London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and the London Health Commission. He was appointed by Government as Deputy Chair of the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation (2004–2008). Within the Assembly, he was variously Chair of Transport, Chair of Planning and Spatial Development, and Chair of Regeneration.

Under Boris Johnson he was a witty and bitter critic although the men developed a strange if challenging rapport. Aside from challenging the Mayor in debate he was for 7 years Chair of the London Assembly Budget Committee. He was also Chair of the GLA Audit Committee, which among other matters considered issues of conduct including of the Mayor. Upon his election as Mayor of Tower Hamlets in 2016 he stood down from the Assembly, and was succeeded by Unmesh Desai.

==Mayor of Tower Hamlets==
===2014: Candidate===
Having won selection as the Labour candidate for directly elected Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Biggs stood against incumbent Lutfur Rahman in 2014. Rahman had previously won support from Mayor of London Ken Livingstone. Livingstone reversed his public position after auditors were appointed to investigate allegations of mismanagement and fraud at the council, but remained privately supportive.

Rahman won the Supplementary Vote election in the second round with 37,395 (52.27%) votes to Biggs&#x27; 34,143 (47.73%) with a total of 84,234 valid ballots cast.

Immediately following the election, four voters challenged the result in the case Erlam v Rahman. In a rare intervention the election court overturned the result, ejecting both Rahman and his election agent from office, barring both from future public office for five years, and forcing a fresh election.

In 2014 Rahman&#x27;s actions while in office led to government appointed commissioners being brought in to the council to review its grant making practices. Further investigations were ordered following the election court judgement in 2015. The final government direction was lifted in 2017.

===2015: Victory and first term===
Following the verdict in Erlam v Rahman a by-election was held on 11 June 2015. Biggs stood against an independent candidate Rabina Khan, who was endorsed by the disqualified Rahman. Biggs beat Khan with 32,754 (55.39%) votes to her 26,384 (44.61%).

His first term in office was dominated by addressing the concerns caused by Rahman&#x27;s actions, and successfully having the government directions lifted. His administration was also marked by a commitment to transparency and accountability, the previous Mayor having markedly refused to answer questions publicly or in the Council chamber.

===2018: Reelection and second term===
Biggs stood for reelection against Rabina Khan now representing the People&#x27;s Alliance of Tower Hamlets, a party formed from the rump of Lutfor Rahman&#x27;s disgraced Tower Hamlets First, and Tower Hamlets Independent Group. Biggs won the election with 44,865 (72.66%) votes to Kahn&#x27;s 16,878 (27.34%), and his leadership resulted in Labour increasing its number of councillors to 42 out of 45.

In his second Mayoral term Biggs, 
* Led a major programme to provide 2000 additional council homes;
* invested in parks and the public realm; 
* led the borough&#x27;s response to COVID-19;
* continued the service improvement begun in his first term; and
* campaigned for improving residents&#x27; safety.

Mayor Biggs committed to investing in additional council funded police officers and youth services, along with a post at the Royal London to work with victims and perpetrators of violence.

Like other London Council Leaders, this all took place to a backdrop of massive budget savings, while working to protect services from national funding cuts.

As a result of work achieved during Biggs tenure Tower Hamlets London Borough Council won a number of awards and was shortlisted for a number of others, including

* Digital Impact;
* Growth and Economic Development;
* Public Health;
* Mental Health;
* Substance Misuse Services;
* Carbon Reduction;
* Hate Crime &amp; Violence against Women;
* Most Improved Council;
* Public Health; 
* Council of the Year; and
* Most Improved Council of the Year.

===2022: Loss===

Biggs lost re-election in 2022 to Rahman and his newly formed Aspire Party by 40,804 (54.90%) to 33,487 (45.10%) votes, a result viewed by many as a surprise.

Within nine months of Aspire&#x27;s victory, in February 2023, with the unexpected departure of the longstanding lead official of Tower Hamlets Council, the Chief Executive of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy raised the prospect that the authorities would once again have to intervene following Lutfur Rahman&#x27;s mismanagement of the council.

Following the election he announced his retirement from elected politics and now works as a consultant and Non-Executive Director.

He is currently a Director (2022–) of Islington &amp; Shoreditch Housing Association.

<doc id="469030" wikidata="Q280734" url="?curid=469030" title="John Myung">
<text>John Ro Myung ( ; born January 24, 1967) is an American bassist and a founding member of progressive metal band Dream Theater.

== Background and personal life ==
Born in Chicago to South Korean parents, Myung grew up with John Petrucci on Long Island. He took violin lessons from the age of five and started playing bass guitar at fifteen. After graduating from high school, he and Petrucci enrolled at the Berklee College of Music, where they met Mike Portnoy. The trio became the nucleus of Dream Theater, which became Myung&#x27;s primary professional focus.

== Style ==
Myung mainly uses a two or three finger picking style in his playing. He sometimes uses slapping and popping on some songs, such as &quot;The Dark Eternal Night&quot;, and also uses tapping and harmonics in his bass playing. Myung&#x27;s use of harmonics is frequently accompanied by a chorus effect, as in the opening of &quot;Lifting Shadows off a Dream&quot;. The songs &quot;These Walls&quot; and &quot;The Dark Eternal Night&quot; feature Myung using a pick. Myung uses both tapping and fingerstyle to play the Chapman Stick.

Myung&#x27;s favorite bands include the Beatles, Black Sabbath, the Who, Iron Maiden, Rush, Yes, Jethro Tull and Genesis. He cites bassists Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, Chris Squire, Steve Harris, Geddy Lee and Jaco Pastorius as main influences on his playing style.

Myung is known for his rigorous practicing schedule; producer Kevin Shirley and keyboardist Derek Sherinian have said that Myung is the only musician they know who &quot;warms down&quot; after a show. Petrucci has said that when he and Myung were in high school, they had an agreement to practice at least six hours every day.

Dream Theater&#x27;s group writing process makes it difficult to identify which member of the band authored a particular song or song section, but on DVD commentaries, the band members have sometimes identified certain parts as &quot;a John Myung riff,&quot; such as parts of &quot;Fatal Tragedy&quot; and the introduction to &quot;The Glass Prison&quot;. Myung wrote the lyrics to one song per album from &quot;Images and Words&quot; to &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot;, but thereafter did not contribute any lyrics until &quot;A Dramatic Turn of Events&quot; and since contributing lyrics to every subsequent album barring &quot;The Astonishing&quot;. Portnoy has claimed that this was because Myung&#x27;s lyrics usually needed some work by the rest of the band to fit the song. As a result, the band eventually imposed an unwritten lyric rule that required lyrics to be &quot;properly formed, phrased, constructed, etc. to go with the melodies,&quot; and, &quot;since then, John has kind of backed off.&quot;

== Instruments ==
=== Early Dream Theater gear ===
For &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot;, Dream Theater&#x27;s debut, Myung played a modified Music Man StingRay four-string bass and a Fender Jazz Bass. The StingRay (his main live instrument in that period) was customized with an added front pickup driving a clean bass amp, while the bridge signal was sent to the effects chain. A four-string Spector NS-2 was used for tracking 1992&#x27;s &quot;Images and Words&quot;.

=== Switch to six-string basses ===
Myung switched to six-string basses for Dream Theater&#x27;s subsequent tours, using several high-end Tobias &quot;Basic&quot; models. These can be seen in videos from &quot;Images and Words&quot; and heard on &quot;Live at the Marquee&quot;. He has primarily used six-string basses ever since.

For the &quot;Awake&quot; album and tours, Myung used basses produced by a small company formed by former Tobias luthier Nicholas Tung. Myung owned at least three of the only 100 instruments constructed, two &quot;Wingbass II Bolt-on&quot; six-strings (one Natural and one Sunburst), and one &quot;Wingbass II Hybrid (a &quot;half neck-through&quot;). The natural-finish Wingbass II was his main live instrument in this period, and all three appear in his &quot;Progressive Bass Concepts&quot; instructional video.

=== Switch to Yamaha ===
After Tung ceased production, Myung began endorsing Yamaha instruments, using its TRB and John Patitucci six-string fretted and fretless basses live while working with Yamaha&#x27;s Artist Custom Shop on what would become his signature instrument. Prototypes of the RBX6JM along with his TRB basses were used for the recording of 1997&#x27;s &quot;Falling into Infinity&quot;. A bolt-on bass with alder body with flame-maple top, 35&quot; scale, and &quot;Infinity&quot; dot inlay on the fretboard, various Red and Blue RBX6JM models were thereafter his main studio and live instruments until 2002, although he experimented with a Hamer 8-string bass and Music Man StingRay five-string while recording &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;.

In 2002, Myung and Yamaha unveiled the RBX-JM2, an updated version of his signature bass that echoed the redesign of Yamaha&#x27;s entire RBX-series of basses. A 34&quot; scale was used instead of the 35&quot; scale used on the RBX6JM had, and a single Seymour Duncan Music Man-type humbucking pickup was used, influenced by Myung&#x27;s use of the StingRay on &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;. (Myung&#x27;s personal RBX-JM2 differed from the production model, having a second pickup and additional controls.) This instrument was used on Dream Theater&#x27;s &quot;Train of Thought&quot; and &quot;Octavarium&quot; albums and tours.

=== Switch to Music Man ===

Footage from the recording of &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot; in 2006 showed Myung playing various Music Man basses. Early in the 2007 &quot;Chaos in Motion Tour&quot;, he was seen playing a MusicMan Bongo 5 HS in a signature &quot;Inca Silver&quot; (flat gray) finish on stage, the first time since before &quot;Images and Words&quot; that Myung had toured with a five-string.

On July 23, 2007, Sterling Ball announced that Myung was moving to Music Man, writing that &quot;John has fallen in love with the prototypes that we made of the Bongo 6 and is now playing them exclusively.&quot; Ball added that the Bongo 6 &quot;is not a signature bass&quot;, but &quot;part of the regular line.&quot;

In an interview with MusicRadar in 2010, Myung stated that he was working with Music Man on a modified Bongo. The finished product was a bass with a six-string body but with the six strings accommodating a five-string neck, resulting in a tighter string spacing. In a later interview, he said that this will not be considered a signature model, per Music Man&#x27;s company policy.. In 2020, Ernie Ball Music Man released the all-new John Myung Signature Bongo Bass.

=== Other instruments ===
Myung has used a twelve-string Grand Chapman Stick on two songs on &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot;, &quot;Take Away My Pain&quot; and most prominently &quot;New Millennium&quot;, which he performs live on Stick. Dream Theater sources report that Myung routinely brings the Stick to the studio and has sometimes made it so far as tracking (the song &quot;Home&quot; from &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot; was originally recorded with a Stick, being replaced with a bass guitar for the final version), but it has not appeared on a Dream Theater studio album since &quot;Falling into Infinity&quot;. Myung did, however, use the Stick on several tracks on Sean Malone&#x27;s second album Gordian Knot including &quot;Srikara Tal&quot; and &quot;Redemption&#x27;s Way.&quot; Myung used a fretless bass on the Dream Theater songs &quot;Through Her Eyes&quot;, &quot;Far From Heaven&quot;, &quot;Hollow Years&quot;, &quot;Peruvian Skies&quot;, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; and &quot;The Silent Man&quot;. He has also used Moog Taurus 3 Bass Pedals since 2011.
