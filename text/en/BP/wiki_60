<text>Prince Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi (; 27 August 1928 – 9 September 2023) was a South African politician and Zulu prince who served as the traditional prime minister to the Zulu royal family from 1954 until his death in 2023. He was appointed to this post by King Bhekuzulu, the son of King Solomon kaDinuzulu (a brother to Buthelezi&#x27;s mother Princess Magogo kaDinuzulu).

Buthelezi was chief minister of the KwaZulu bantustan during apartheid and founded the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in 1975, leading it until 2019, and became its president emeritus soon after that. He was a political leader during Nelson Mandela&#x27;s incarceration (1964–1990) and continued to be so in the post-apartheid era, when he was appointed by Mandela as Minister of Home Affairs, serving from 1994 to 2004.

Buthelezi was one of the most prominent black politicians of the apartheid era. He was the sole political leader of the KwaZulu government, entering when it was still the native reserve of Zululand in 1970 and remaining in office until it was abolished in 1994. Critics described his administration as a de facto one-party state, intolerant of political opposition and dominated by Inkatha (now the IFP), Buthelezi&#x27;s political movement.

In parallel to his mainstream political career, Buthelezi held the Inkosiship of the Buthelezi clan, being the son of Inkosi Mathole Buthelezi, and was traditional prime minister to three successive Zulu kings, beginning with King Cyprian Bhekuzulu in 1954. He was himself born into the Zulu royal family; his maternal grandfather was King Dinuzulu who was a son of King Cetshwayo and whom Buthelezi played in the 1964 film called &quot;Zulu.&quot; While leader of KwaZulu, Buthelezi both strengthened and appropriated the public profile of the monarchy, reviving it as a symbol of Zulu nationalism. Bolstered by royal support, state resources, and Buthelezi&#x27;s personal popularity, Inkatha became one of the largest political organisations in the country.

During the same period, Buthelezi publicly opposed apartheid and often took a patently obstructive stance toward the apartheid government. He lobbied consistently for the release of Nelson Mandela and staunchly refused to accept the nominal independence which the government offered to KwaZulu, correctly judging that it was a superficial independence. However, Buthelezi was derided in some quarters for participating in the bantustan system, a central pillar of apartheid, and for his moderate stance on such issues as free markets, armed struggle, and international sanctions. He became a of young activists in the Black Consciousness Movement and was repudiated by many in the African National Congress (ANC). A former ANC Youth League member, Buthelezi had aligned himself and Inkatha with the ANC in the 1970s, but in the 1980s their relationship became increasingly acrimonious. It emerged in the 1990s that Buthelezi had accepted money and military assistance from the apartheid regime for Inkatha, which stoked the political violence in KwaZulu and Natal in the 1980s and 1990s.

Buthelezi also played a complicated role during the negotiations to end apartheid, for which he helped set the framework as early as 1974 with the Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith. During the Congress for a Democratic South Africa, the IFP under Buthelezi lobbied for a federal system in South Africa with strong guarantees for regional autonomy and the status of Zulu traditional leaders. This proposal did not take hold and Buthelezi became aggrieved by what he perceived as the growing marginalisation both of the IFP and of himself personally, as negotiations were increasingly dominated by the ANC, and the white National Party government. He established the Concerned South Africans Group with other conservatives, withdrew from the negotiations, and launched a boycott of the 1994 general election, South Africa&#x27;s first under universal suffrage. However, despite fears that Buthelezi would upend the peaceful transition entirely, Buthelezi and the IFP relented soon before the election, and not only participated, but also joined the Government of National Unity formed afterwards by newly elected President Mandela. Buthelezi served as Minister of Home Affairs under Mandela and under his successor, Thabo Mbeki, despite near-continuous tensions between the IFP and the governing ANC.

In subsequent years, the IFP struggled to expand its popular base beyond the new province of KwaZulu-Natal, which had absorbed KwaZulu in 1994. As the party&#x27;s electoral fortunes declined, Buthelezi survived attempts by rivals within the party to unseat him. He remained the IFP&#x27;s president until the party&#x27;s 35th National General Conference in August 2019, when he declined to seek re-election and was succeeded by Velenkosini Hlabisa. In the 2019 general election, he was elected to a sixth consecutive term as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the IFP. He was the oldest MP in his country at the time of his death in 2023.

Buthelezi&#x27;s role during the final decades of apartheid is controversial, and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that the IFP under Buthelezi&#x27;s leadership &quot;was the primary non-state perpetrator&quot; of violence during the apartheid era and named him as &quot;a major perpetrator of violence and human rights abuses&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Prince Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi was born on 27 August 1928, at Ceza Swedish Missionary Hospital in Mahlabathini in southeastern Natal. His mother was Princess Magogo kaDinuzulu, the daughter of former Zulu King Dinuzulu and sister of the incumbent King Solomon kaDinuzulu. In 1923, she became the tenth but principal wife (and ultimately one of 40 wives) of Buthelezi&#x27;s father, Mathole Buthelezi. Mathole Buthelezi was a traditional leader as chief of the Buthelezi clan and his marriage to the princess was arranged by King Solomon to heal a rift between the clan and the royal family. Buthelezi is sometimes referred to by his clan name, Shenge, used as an honorific.

=== Education ===
Buthelezi was educated at Impumalanga Primary School at Mahashini in Nongoma from 1935 to 1943, then at Adams College, a famous mission school in Amanzimtoti, from 1944 to 1946. From 1948 to 1950, he studied at the University of Fort Hare in the eastern Cape Province. In 1948, the National Party was elected to government in South Africa and began implementing a formal system of apartheid, and Buthelezi joined the anti-apartheid African National Congress (ANC) Youth League in 1949. In January 2012, he said of this period:I was taught by Professor ZK Matthews, I knew Dr John Langalibalele Dube, I was mentored by Inkosi Albert Luthuli, and I worked closely with Mr Oliver Tambo and Mr Nelson Mandela. My personal history cannot be extricated from the history of the liberation struggle, or from that of the African National Congress.Buthelezi made much of his association with Pixley ka Isaka Seme, a founder of the ANC, who was married to his mother&#x27;s half-sister. He counted Seme, Albert Luthuli, and Mahatma Gandhi as among his political influences; he was also inspired by Martin Luther King&#x27;s leadership of the American civil rights movement. He was expelled from Fort Hare in 1950 for participating in a student boycott during a visit to the campus of Gideon Brand Van Zyl, the Governor-General. He later completed his Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Natal and worked as a clerk in the government&#x27;s Department of Native Affairs in Durban.

=== Traditional leadership ===

==== Inkosi ====

In 1953, Buthelezi returned to Mahlabathini to become chief (inkosi) of the Buthelezi clan, a hereditary position and lifetime appointment. In his account, he had planned to become a lawyer but had been advised to accept the chieftaincy by ANC leaders Albert Luthuli and Walter Sisulu. Buthelezi later recounted how Luthuli had persuaded him not to &quot;betray my people and seek my own selfish ends away from them&quot;. He also said that his mother had encouraged him to take up the role. During apartheid, the government was responsible for recognising the status of chiefs, and Buthelezi&#x27;s chieftaincy was not recognised until 1957, according to him because the government was wary of his activism. In other accounts, the delay was caused by a succession battle in the Buthelezi family, in which the government ultimately favoured Buthelezi over his elder half-brother Mceleli. Mceleli was later banished from the region.

As chief, Buthelezi was involved in organising a ceremony to unveil the Shaka Memorial in Stanger in September 1954, sometimes called the first Shaka Day celebration; he later said that the ceremony was the first time he or King Cyprian Bhekuzulu had ever worn &quot;traditional&quot; Zulu dress, which they did frequently thereafter. He also acted in the 1964 film &quot;Zulu&quot;, about the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, playing the role of his real-life great-grandfather, King Cetshwayo kaMpande. He said that the role had already been cast but &quot;when they came to my place, mainly to get extras for the battle scenes, then they noticed a family resemblance to my great-grandfather. They said how would it be if you played the part? I agreed.&quot;

==== Traditional prime minister ====
In 1954, King Cyprian appointed Buthelezi his traditional prime minister – Buthelezi lists the full title as Traditional Prime Minister to the Zulu Nation (&quot;uNdunankulu kaZulu&quot;) and Monarch. He was reappointed by Cyprian&#x27;s successor, King Goodwill Zwelithini, in 1968. According to Buthelezi, his paternal family was traditionally responsible for providing the royal family with its prime ministers, although the term itself was apparently a new innovation and referred to what previously might have been called the king&#x27;s premier chief, his most senior advisor among the traditional leaders beneath him. He pointed in particular to his paternal great-grandfather, Mnyamana, who was a senior advisor to his maternal great-grandfather, King Cetshwayo, during the Anglo-Zulu War, and also claimed that his father was appointed traditional prime minister to his uncle, King Solomon, in 1925.

Buthelezi&#x27;s hereditary claims in this respect are not uncontroversial. In particular, some Zulus dispute Buthelezi&#x27;s claim that his paternal great-great-grandfather, Nqengelele Buthelezi, was &quot;the most senior advisor&quot; to King Shaka, founder of the Zulu kingdom; they argue that the role was filled by Ngomane of the Mthethwas, and also point out that several kings in the intervening period did not have Buthelezis as advisers. Buthelezi&#x27;s supporters sometimes claim instead that Nqengelele was a senior advisor &quot;alongside Ngomane&quot;. Others point out that, especially since the colonial period, when traditional leadership structures were politicised to help administer indirect rule, traditional leadership positions &quot;have rarely been a simple product of genealogy&quot;.

A more specific challenge to Buthelezi&#x27;s authority came after King Cyprian&#x27;s death in 1968. Prince Mcwayizeni Israel Zulu insisted that he was the monarch&#x27;s rightful senior advisor, as the most senior Zulu prince, and ahead of Zwelithini&#x27;s coronation, he entered into a decades-long feud with Buthelezi. Buthelezi was rumoured to have been estranged from the royal family from 1968 to 1970, as his status as traditional prime minister came into question.

== Government of KwaZulu: 1970–1994 ==
=== Establishment of KwaZulu ===

Buthelezi&#x27;s native region, the native reserve of Zululand, was affected by the Bantu Self-Government Act of 1959 and the first Bantu authorities were established in 1959, though with significant resistance from parts of the population and tribal leadership. In 1970, the Zululand Territorial Authority was established, and its 200 members, most of them traditional leaders, unanimously elected Buthelezi its chief executive officer. Buthelezi again claimed that ANC leaders – Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo – had encouraged him to accept the position.

Over the next decade, Zululand was transformed into KwaZulu, the most populous of the ten bantustans (or &quot;homelands&quot;) established by the South African government as part of the NP&#x27;s scheme of grand apartheid. Under the Bantu Self-Government Act, each of the Bantu or black African ethnic groups would govern itself, under Bantu authorities pursuing the policy of separate development, in a territory that would ultimately become fully independent of white-ruled South Africa. KwaZulu (meaning &quot;place of the Zulus&quot;) was the bantustan allocated to Zulu South Africans, who, under the Black Homelands Citizenship Act of 1970, had their South African citizenship revoked in favour of nominal KwaZulu citizenship. In line with Bantu Homelands Constitution Act of 1971, a separate constitution was promulgated for KwaZulu in 1972 to provide for &quot;stage one&quot; of the territory&#x27;s self-government; it created the indirectly elected KwaZulu Legislative Assembly, dominated by traditional leaders, which replaced the Zululand Territorial Authority.

Under this new system, Buthelezi became head of the executive branch as the Chief Executive Councillor of KwaZulu; his title was changed to Chief Minister in February 1977 when the territory was declared fully &quot;self-governing&quot; and its government was granted additional powers.

=== Relations with the royal family ===
The 1972 KwaZulu constitution vested all executive powers in Buthelezi and granted the Zulu king a largely ceremonial role, requiring him to &quot;hold himself aloof from party politics and sectionalism&quot;. This was a political triumph for Buthelezi. Viewed as a modernist, he had prevailed against monarchists in the Zulu traditional leadership who had argued that executive powers should be vested in the Zulu monarchy. This proposition had tempted the NP government, partly because of Buthelezi&#x27;s &quot;patently obstructive and critical stance&quot;. On some accounts, it was during this struggle that Buthelezi began to appeal to his family&#x27;s tradition of providing traditional prime ministers, seeking to establish a claim to the premiership.During his tenure in the KwaZulu government, there were &quot;a series of crises&quot; as Buthelezi attempted to entrench King Zwelithini&#x27;s position as a constitutional monarch and to disable him politically. In 1979, for example, he accused the king and Prince Mcwayizeni of attempting to form an opposition party together; in 1980, newspapers reported that Zwelithini had attempted to join the apartheid army but had been blocked by Buthelezi. Despite this, in other respects the Zulu monarchy underwent a renaissance during Buthelezi&#x27;s premiership. After the defeat of the Zulu kingdom in 1879, Zulu monarchs had become subjects of the South African government, and the monarchy&#x27;s power and stature had suffered; in 1951 King Cyprian&#x27;s recognition by the NP government was something of a landmark. Buthelezi&#x27;s intimacy with the royal family thus allowed a symbiotic mutual benefit, as Buthelezi appropriated the symbols of the Zulu monarchy for political gain, particularly reviving them in service of Zulu nationalism, while also reviving the cultural relevance of the monarchy. Buthelezi told a gathering in 1985:His Majesty and I share a platform and symbolize the unity of our people. His Majesty symbolizes the deep spirit of unity for the Zulu people and I symbolize the political determination to pursue time-honoured values which have always been important in the struggle for liberty. Together His Majesty and I share the load which is placed on the Zulu nation. We will never be torn apart.According to Jo Beall, Buthelezi was able to mobilise Zulu symbols in this way because he maintained a support base among the region&#x27;s other traditional leaders, who &quot;bought into and gave credence to his use of Zulu ethnic identity for political purposes&quot;.

=== Foundation of Inkatha ===

Buthelezi founded the Inkatha National Cultural Liberation Movement at KwaNzimela outside Melmoth on 21 March 1975 and became its first president. In Zulu, it was first known as Inkatha ya kaZulu (Inkatha of the Zulu), and then renamed Inkatha ye Sizwe (Inkatha of the Nation) or Inkatha ye Nkululeko ye Sizwe (Inkatha of National Liberation). The name &quot;inkatha&quot; derived from the sacred Zulu coil, a symbol of the unity of the Zulu nation and of fealty to the Zulu king. The name Inkatha ya kaZulu came from its predecessor movement, founded by Buthelezi&#x27;s maternal uncle King Solomon in 1928, which Buthelezi sought to revive. The earlier movement was, in Buthelezi&#x27;s words, &quot;a national movement to restore national consciousness and pride&quot;; it was primarily a traditionalist cultural movement. According to Buthelezi, adopting the name Inkatha had been the suggestion of Bishop Alphaeus Zulu, who hoped that an emphasis on cultural matters might protect the organisation from being banned by the apartheid government.

Yet the new Inkatha had political aims: on the movement&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 2015 Buthelezi said he had formed the party to &quot;reignite mobilisation among the oppressed majority in the hiatus left by the banning of political parties [by the apartheid government]. From the very beginning, we spoke of equality, freedom, negotiations and peaceful resistance&quot;. In the 1970s, Inkatha&#x27;s declared objectives included the liberation of Africans from cultural domination by whites; the eradication of neocolonialism and imperialism; the abolition of all forms of racial discrimination, racialism, and racial segregation; and the development of a framework for power-sharing and political reform in South Africa.

Another of Inkatha&#x27;s declared objectives was to uphold the &quot;inalienable rights&quot; of Zulus to self-determination and national independence. Formally, and as Buthelezi often insisted, Inkatha was not a sectional party but a national movement open to all black South Africans; in practice its members were almost all Zulus from the KwaZulu region. It came to be closely associated with Zulu nationalism, often boosted by myths of dubious historical veracity. Buthelezi&#x27;s biographer, Gerhard Maré, wrote in 1991: Inkatha has relied on politicized cultural diversity, on a militant Zulu ethnicity, to mobilize people into its fold... Buthelezi argues that &quot;Zulus,&quot; a social construct that has been anything but constant over time, should have a separate political dispensation, that its members have certain unique personality traits, that an insult directed at that identity deserves retribution, and that its survival justifies conflict with other organizations and individuals.A notable feature of Inkatha was its &quot;over-personalised&quot; character: it was, in R. W. Johnson&#x27;s phrase, perceived &quot;as a one-man band&quot;. Buthelezi remained Inkatha&#x27;s sole president throughout apartheid and for more than two decades afterwards. According to Marina Ottaway, Buthelezi envisioned the formation and growth of Inkatha as a means of extending his ideological and organisational control of KwaZulu. It has also been suggested that he hoped the movement would help entrench his power over King Zwelithini. Buthelezi said that the idea had been born on a visit to Lusaka, Zambia, in 1974, when Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, &quot;speaking on behalf of the Frontline States&quot;, had &quot;urged me to found a membership-based organisation to reignite political mobilisation&quot; in South Africa and to create &quot;a cohesive force&quot;.

Buthelezi also attempted to build broader political coalitions. In 1976, he formed the Black Unity Front to coordinate among bantustan leaders, and in January 1978 he spearheaded the formation of a spin-off organisation, the South African Black Alliance. The Alliance initially comprised Inkatha, the Labour Party, and the Indian Reform Party; Buthelezi was elected its chairman. Its objectives were to forge black unity and prepare for a broad-based national convention, with a longer-term goal of becoming the major opposition force to the apartheid government. However, its impact was &quot;minimal&quot;, partly because its multi-racial participants were wary of Buthelezi&#x27;s &quot;dubious record on cross-ethnic relations&quot;.

=== Governance ===
Although Buthelezi dubbed KwaZulu a &quot;liberated zone&quot;, elements of his administration were authoritarian, and he was described as personally exerting &quot;iron-fisted control&quot; over KwaZulu. He was not only chief minister but also finance minister, and became police minister in 1980 when the KwaZulu Police was established. In addition to alleged abuses by the police force, a common complaint was that Buthelezi restricted political organisation, making KwaZulu a de facto one-party &quot;state&quot;. This was the result of legal and coercive constraints, but also of the Zulu royal family&#x27;s close alignment to Inkatha, which allowed Inkatha leaders &quot;to imply that opposition to the movement is synonymous with disloyalty to the Zulu nation as a whole&quot;. Opposition was also restricted inside Inkatha – for example, the organisation&#x27;s constitution prescribed that only the KwaZulu chief minister could serve as party president.

The Inkatha constitution additionally set out that all Zulus automatically became members of Inkatha, although it also set out membership fees; as Buthelezi explained in 1975, &quot;all members of the Zulu nation are automatically members of Inkatha if they are Zulus. There may be members who are inactive members as no one escapes being a member as long as he or she is a member of the Zulu nation&quot;. An Inkatha membership card was known to be a virtual prerequisite for expedient access to public services and, in many sectors, for employment in the public service. In 1978, for example, the legislative assembly adopted a ruling that public servants&#x27; standing in Inkatha would be taken into account when the Public Service Commission assessed them for promotion; and in 1989 schoolteachers complained about being &quot;invited&quot; to join Inkatha or risk being fired. Thus R. W. Johnson referred to Inkatha&#x27;s reputation for recruitment by means of &quot;administrative coercion&quot;; the &quot;New York Times&quot; compared it to Tammany Hall at its peak.

King Zwelithini was Inkatha&#x27;s official patron, and the entire membership of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly served on Inkatha&#x27;s National Council, formally designated in terms of the Inkatha constitution as the supreme body of the &quot;Zulu nation&quot;. Human Rights Watch said in 1993 that KwaZulu government institutions were &quot;virtually identical&quot; with Inkatha institutions, and that Inkatha often benefitted from the protection and resources of the KwaZulu state. From 1976, Inkatha rolled out &quot;education for nationhood&quot; in public schools, introducing Inkatha&#x27;s &quot;philosophy&quot; into the curriculum, and public teachers were required to make time available for students to participate in the activities of Inkatha&#x27;s youth wing, the Inkatha Youth Brigade. A 1993 report by Human Rights Watch concluded: Freedom of expression, assembly, and association all endorsed by the draft constitution for KwaZulu/Natal proposed by the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly are not respected. The KwaZulu Police are allowed to operate with an almost complete lack of accountability for their actions, and are routinely guilty of incompetence, bias and even criminal activities... In these circumstances, the continuing existence of the KwaZulu homeland is itself one of the principal obstacles to free political activity in the Natal region.However, Buthelezi was instrumental in setting up teacher training and nursing colleges throughout the late-1970s and the early-1980s. According to him, he spearheaded the establishment of the Mangosuthu University of Technology in Umlazi through fundraising, primarily from mining magnate Harry Oppenheimer, with whom he was friendly.

=== Relations with the apartheid government ===
==== KwaZulu independence ====
Throughout apartheid, Buthelezi stridently refused to accept the full – but largely nominal – political and legal independence proffered by the central government and accepted by the TBVC states. In 1976, at a rally commemorating the Sharpeville massacre, he declared, &quot;South Africa is one country. It has one destiny. Those who are attempting to divide the land of our birth are attempting to stem the tide of history.&quot; In April 1981, he rejected &quot;Pretoria&#x27;s plans for this fraudulent independence&quot;, saying that Zulus would &quot;prefer to die in the hundreds of thousands than be forced to be foreigners in their homeland, which is South Africa&quot;.

==== Swazi takeover ====
In 1982, Buthelezi led a political and legal battle to block the government from carrying out a proposed land deal, which would have seen the region of Ingwavuma in northern KwaZulu – from the Mozambican border in the west to the Indian Ocean coast in the east – ceded to neighbouring Swaziland. In this he partnered with Enos Mabuza, leader of the kaNgwane bantustan, which would have been ceded to Swaziland in its entirety under the proposed deal. Buthelezi argued that the apartheid government intended to use the land deal to extend South African influence in Swaziland; it would have allowed Swaziland to act as a conservative buffer state between South Africa and the left-wing, pro-ANC Frontline State of Mozambique. Observers also pointed out that it would advance the apartheid policy of stripping black South Africans of South African citizenship and that it could be a form of retaliation against Buthelezi for refusing to accept KwaZulu independence.

Buthelezi held popular demonstrations against the deal, lobbied the Organisation of African Unity for support, and challenged the plan four successive times in court. While a fifth judgement was pending, the apartheid government shelved the plan. In a prime example of his strategy of using the apartheid government&#x27;s own policies against it , he won the case with the argument that the government&#x27;s own law required it to consult bantustan leaders on the deal. Allister Sparks said it was &quot;the first time in memory&quot; that &quot;black South Africans have forced the white segregationist government to back down on a major issue involving the ideology of apartheid or racial separation&quot;. In 2022 a statue of Buthelezi was erected in Jozini, Ingwavuma, to commemorate his role.

== Role in the anti-apartheid struggle ==
The value and sincerity of Buthelezi&#x27;s contribution to the anti-apartheid struggle was a highly polarising issue inside South Africa during apartheid and remains controversial. Archbishop Desmond Tutu famously asked Buthelezi to leave the funeral of Robert Sobukwe in 1978 because supporters of the Pan Africanist Movement objected fiercely to his presence, throwing stones at him and calling him a &quot;sell-out&quot; and &quot;government stooge&quot;. Though Buthelezi left the event at Tutu&#x27;s request, he had reportedly told the youths, &quot;If you chaps want to kill me, do so. I am prepared to die&quot;; he reflected afterwards, &quot;I remember our Lord&#x27;s crucifixion. He was spat on too&quot;.

The Black Consciousness Movement was particularly critical; for example, the South African Students&#x27; Organisation organised demonstrations at the University of Zululand in 1976 to protest the award of an honorary doctorate to Buthelezi. In the late 1970s, Tambo of the ANC told Herbert Vilakazi that &quot;these &#x27;76 boys&quot; – young ANC members radicalised during the 1976 Soweto Uprising and influenced by Black Consciousness – were insisting that he should &quot;stop having relations with Buthelezi&quot; and &quot;consider him an enemy&quot;. Their stance was influenced by that of Steve Biko, the leading Black Consciousness intellectual, who had argued that the apartheid government was exploiting Buthelezi – rather than vice versa, as Buthelezi believed – and that Buthelezi &quot;solves so many conscience problems&quot; both for white South Africans and for foreign observers. Indeed, in his famous exposition of blackness as a political identification, Biko used Buthelezi as his example of someone who appeared black but operated as an extension of a white system.

=== Separate development ===
Because he was the political leader of a bantustan, Buthelezi&#x27;s alleged &quot;collaboration&quot; with the separate development scheme, and therefore with apartheid, was highly controversial. Nevertheless, he always insisted that his role in the bantustan system was compatible with his avowed opposition to apartheid. Academic Laurence Piper, conceding that Buthelezi&#x27;s brand of resistance politics was &quot;peculiar&quot;, described him as &quot;a conservative nationalist intent on &#x27;using the system against itself&#x27; by advancing anti-apartheid politics within the boundaries of government tolerance&quot;. In this vein, responding to the accusation that he had switched allegiances, Buthelezi said, &quot;What I&#x27;m doing is working within the system&quot;. Indeed, historian Stephen Ellis wrote that, perhaps excepting Bantu Holomisa, Buthelezi was &quot;more successful than any other homeland leader in asserting his own autonomy&quot; against the apartheid state.

In 1971, Buthelezi said that, &quot;Homeland leaders who have accepted separate development have done so because it is the only way in which Blacks in South Africa can express themselves politically.&quot; He consistently lobbied for the government to make the separate development policy &quot;meaningful&quot; by granting genuine autonomy to the bantustans: his policy was &quot;one of accepting separate development as the only practical alternative and trying to force the government to match theory with practice&quot;. Also in 1971, in a column for the &quot;Rand Daily Mail&quot; entitled &quot;End This Master-Servant Relationship&quot;, Buthelezi called on the central government to provide KwaZulu with more land and resources, arguing:The plain truth of the matter is that if the South African Government does not deliver the goods on the basis of its own scheme, the Blacks of this country will become even more disillusioned than at present... I am not prepared to say that separate development is the only hope, but it may be a contribution to the development of the situation. It may be a contribution to the unravelling of the problem, insofar as, if we attain full independence, our hand will be strengthened. Gone will be the days then, one hopes, when people will think of us simply as &#x27;kaffirs.&#x27;Buthelezi&#x27;s admirers point out that he initially, and skilfully, resisted the central government&#x27;s plan to implement separate development in KwaZulu, taking an &quot;intransigent&quot; stance that set him apart from the leaders of other black areas. They argue that he submitted to the process of drafting the KwaZulu constitution only under intense pressure both from the NP government and from his colleagues in the Zululand tribal authorities, and that he later delayed KwaZulu&#x27;s progression to full self-government by delaying the required elections, including by insisting that voter registration should be conducted using new identity cards rather than the detested &quot;dompas&quot; (pass books). His critics submit that the delays were designed to give him time to sideline monarchist leaders who might otherwise have sought to unseat him. Yet his supporters respond that he sought to sideline the monarchists in the knowledge that they were likely to &quot;organiz[e] the authority on conservative lines in cooperation with the white bureaucracy&quot;.

Admirers also point to his refusal to accept independence for KwaZulu, which – especially since KwaZulu was the country&#x27;s most populous bantustan – stymied the full implementation of separate development. Speaking in December 1994, Gavin Relly, the former chairman of Anglo American, said that Buthelezi&#x27;s refusal to accept nominal independence made him &quot;the anvil on which apartheid was broken&quot;. Buthelezi agreed with this assessment. In a characteristic rebuke of his critics in 1991, he said that they were &quot;snapping at my heels from behind as I march forward&quot; towards a prosperous, stable and non-racial South Africa: &quot;they do not have the greatness in them to formulate the tasks, let alone to pursue the tasks&quot;.

=== Relations with the African National Congress ===
While he was leader of KwaZulu, Buthelezi&#x27;s relationship with the ANC was complex. Inkatha had been founded in 1975 with the blessing of the ANC leadership, including ANC president Oliver Tambo; the ANC had been banned by the South African government since 1960 and operated in exile from Lusaka, Zambia. According to Buthelezi, he remained in contact with Tambo and with Nelson Mandela, then imprisoned, whom he respected greatly. In the 1970s, Buthelezi publicly embraced the ANC and adopted its symbols – including its colours, green, black and gold – for Inkatha. He reminded people that Seme and John Dube had been involved in Inkatha&#x27;s predecessor movement, founded by his uncle. The overwhelming implication of many of Buthelezi&#x27;s public statements during the time was that Inkatha was continuous with the historical tradition of the ANC and even constituted, in a symbolic sense, the ANC&#x27;s internal wing. In 1985, after the relationship had deteriorated, Tambo said that the ANC leadership had agreed to the formation of Inkatha in 1975 in the hope that Buthelezi could lead mass anti-apartheid mobilisation through the legal avenues available to politicians in the bantustan system. His view was that the ANC had not sufficiently supported and guided Inkatha after 1975 and that Buthelezi was the ANC&#x27;s &quot;fault&quot;.

The turning point was a meeting between Buthelezi and Tambo in London on 30 October 1979. In Buthelezi&#x27;s account of the meeting, the ANC proposed that Inkatha operate as its surrogate in KwaZulu, particularly providing safe houses and recruits for the armed wing Umkhonto weSizwe; Buthelezi refused because he objected to the ANC&#x27;s armed struggle. According to an analyst at the South African Institute of Race Relations, it was clear that Buthelezi and the ANC had fallen out over some form of disagreement about &quot;who was going to be the tail and who was going to be the dog&quot;. While the ANC had only a meagre presence inside South Africa at the time, opinion polling indicated that Buthelezi was certainly one of black South Africa&#x27;s most popular politicians, and Inkatha had an estimated membership of about 250,000 people; it is possible that Buthelezi and his advisors believed that his popularity should earn him recognition by the ANC as leader of the anti-apartheid movement.

In June 1980, the ANC&#x27;s Alfred Nzo delivered a public repudiation of Buthelezi and Inkatha, widely reported on in South Africa, in which he said that Buthelezi&#x27;s actions could no longer be seen as the flawed implementation of good intentions but had to be recognised as the actions of a &quot;police agent&quot; and &quot;jail warder&quot;. Completing the break, Tambo said that Inkatha had &quot;emerged on the side of the enemy against the people&quot;. Throughout the 1980s, there was strong anti-Buthelezi sentiment among segments of the ANC. An internal ANC document published in June 1985 said that Buthelezi &quot;projects the illusion of autonomy from the enemy and pretends to pursue national aims. His counterrevolutionary role must be exposed and we must work to win over his supporters and deprive him of his social base.&quot; At a meeting with the ANC in January 1991 – Buthelezi&#x27;s first since 1979 – Buthelezi reportedly complained to attendees that &quot;very few&quot; members of the ANC National Executive Committee had not &quot;at one time or another engaged in my vilification&quot;, and then provided a list of examples of attacks. These included that Chris Hani had called him &quot;a government lackey and running dog&quot; who was &quot;living in a fool&#x27;s paradise&quot; and that Joe Slovo had said his political program was tribalism in disguise.

Buthelezi had responded by criticising the exiled ANC in turn. By the mid-1980s, he claimed publicly that the ANC in exile was not the genuine standard-bearer of the pre-1960 ANC of Seme and Luthuli; Inkatha, instead, was the heir of its political principles and historical role in the liberation of black people in South Africa. He also founded in 1986 a conservative trade union, the United Workers Union of South Africa, allied with Inkatha, to counter the growing influence of the ANC-aligned Congress of South African Trade Unions. According to observers, the ANC&#x27;s repudiation of Buthelezi, coupled with its diplomatic offensive in the 1980s, narrowed Buthelezi&#x27;s political options and opened a competition over popular support, partly explaining Buthelezi&#x27;s growing turn in the 1980s towards appeals to conservative constituencies in South Africa and abroad, including through increased emphasis on Zulu nationalism.

=== Methods of resistance ===
Buthelezi deviated from the orthodoxy of the anti-apartheid movement in ways other than his involvement in the homeland system. Some contemporary reappraisals conclude that Buthelezi, though fundamentally opposed to apartheid, endorsed less radical methods than the ANC and other groups. During the 1976 Soweto uprising, he condemned the harsh police response but also condemned the riots and appealed to &quot;responsible elements&quot; to form vigilante units to protect township property; his influence is credited with having prevented the protests from spreading to KwaZulu. In the 1980s, he was a strident anti-communist and claimed that the ANC, then operating from exile, was undemocratic and dominated by hardline communists. He opposed the armed struggle and the student protests, consumer boycotts, and union strikes that dominated grassroots anti-apartheid organising in that period under the United Democratic Front (UDF). He was also an outspoken opponent of international sanctions against the apartheid state, arguing that black people bore their economic costs; &quot;I have responsibility to see that black children are educated and fed, that their parents have jobs and housing,&quot; he said. He lobbied for the repeal of the American Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, including on visits to the United States during which he met with President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and President George H. W. Bush in 1991. Indeed, he was highly popular with American conservatives and organisations such as the Heritage Foundation. He also developed a lifelong friendship with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

However, Buthelezi rejected the 1983 Constitution introduced by the NP to establish the Tricameral Parliament, believing, as other activists did, that the political reforms it introduced were insufficient. He campaigned for a &quot;no&quot; vote in the 1983 constitutional referendum alongside Frederik van Zyl Slabbert of the Progressive Federal Party and other liberals. The &quot;New York Times&quot; observed that he treated P. W. Botha, who led the South African government throughout the 1980s, &quot;with patent contempt&quot;. In 1986, for example, Buthelezi said that Botha &quot;has got his head so deeply buried in the sand that you will have to recognize him by the shape of his shoes&quot;, and he refused to meet with Botha for five years after Botha was impolite to him in a meeting. Moreover, in addition to his refusal to accept nominal independence for KwaZulu, he refused to negotiate constitutional questions with the NP government while Nelson Mandela and other black political leaders remained imprisoned. Mandela thanked Buthelezi for his constant agitation in this regard, both in a private letter from Robben Island and then publicly after his release in February 1990. Buthelezi claimed that he was solely responsible for persuading the government to enter into negotiations with black leaders and to release Mandela: &quot;The government has come to this position because of me. The government has released Mandela because of me. It&#x27;s I who released Mandela!&quot; Indeed, &quot;Securing the release of Mandela and political prisoners to begin democratic negotiations&quot; remained listed on his parliamentary biography in 2022.

=== Political violence and third force ===
For some ANC leaders, their most significant gripe with Buthelezi was the perception that he had ordered, sanctioned, or allowed the ongoing political violence in KwaZulu, Natal, and the Transvaal between Inkatha supporters and groups aligned to the ANC and broader Congress movement, including the UDF. The violence had begun in the 1980s, continued well into the 1990s, and was often described as constituting a low-intensity civil war. In August 1990, Mandela reportedly dismissed the prospect of meeting with Buthelezi because &quot;we cannot meet a man who wants to see the blood of black people&quot;; Jay Naidoo publicly called him a &quot;murderer&quot;. Buthelezi&#x27;s alleged involvement in political violence is also the primary concern of some of his harshest contemporary critics, such as &quot;City Press&quot; editor Mondli Makhanya. At the time, Buthelezi blamed the ANC for the violence; he still did in 2019. He said that he had never endorsed violence and that he could not control any &quot;high-ranking members of Inkatha who have been involved in acts of violence in their local situations&quot;; but the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that his public statements about the violence were &quot;calculatedly ambiguous&quot;. For example, he frequently defended Zulus&#x27; right to self-defence and to carry the cultural or traditional weapons, such as assegais, that were often used in violent clashes with ANC supporters.

In the early 1990s, the ANC theorised the political violence as caused by a state-sponsored &quot;third force&quot; bent on dividing and destabilising the anti-apartheid movement. Buthelezi dismissed this claim, saying in 1991, &quot;We should not pretend that the real violence in South Africa is not by and large produced by blacks in attacks on blacks.&quot; However, evidence later uncovered suggested that the ANC was correct that the state had some degree of involvement in the violence, insofar as there was a degree of covert collaboration between Inkatha and the apartheid government in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In mid-1991, the &quot;Weekly Mail&quot; broke the Inkathagate scandal, revealing that the state had provided R250 000 in covert support to Inkatha and R1.5 million to the affiliated United Workers&#x27; Union. The funding was paid directly to a secret account in Buthelezi&#x27;s name. According to one leaked internal document, the support was designed to be used to &quot;show everyone that [Buthelezi] has a strong base.&quot;

Later in the 1990s, it was revealed that Inkatha had received significant military assistance from the apartheid military under a project codenamed Operation Marion. Under the project, the South African Defence Force (SADF) provided military training and other aid to Inkatha recruits, who would constitute an elite paramilitary force. About 200 Inkatha members, called the Caprivi 200, were flown to a SADF base in the Caprivi Strip in Namibia (then South West Africa) for military training in early 1986. The project apparently originated in a covert request from Buthelezi. He reportedly approached the state for help training Inkatha protection units for Inkatha leaders, himself among them, who were explicitly or implicitly threatened by political rivals, including the ANC and UDF. However, the SADF-trained Inkatha unit was clearly intended to carry out offensive, as well as defensive, functions, and indeed they became a sort of hit squad. Among other things, Inkatha recruits were trained by special forces in the use of Soviet weapons, heavy duty weapons including mortars and RPG-7s; explosives, land mines, and hand grenades; and techniques for &quot;attacks on houses with aim of killing all the occupants&quot;, as occurred in the 1988 Trust Feed massacre; once operational, the recruits also received assistance from South African Police officers who attempted to ensure that arrested Caprivi trainees obtained bail and were released. The Caprivi 200 were responsible for several assassinations of prominent UDF and ANC activists in Natal.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission conducted a comprehensive investigation and summarised its findings as follows:In 1986, the SADF force conspired with Inkatha to provide Inkatha with a covert, offensive paramilitary unit (hit squad) to be deployed illegally against persons and organisations perceived to be opposed to or enemies of both the South African government and Inkatha. The SADF provided training, financial and logistical management and behind-the-scenes supervision... Persons involved in giving the training and persons receiving training testified that they were giving and receiving training in order to engage in the unlawful killing of people... The Commission finds that the gross violations of human rights committed in consequence of Operation Marion were part of a systematic pattern of abuse that entailed deliberate planning on the part of the former state, the KwaZulu government, and the Inkatha political organisation.The Commission found that Buthelezi had been personally involved in planning the operation (which Buthelezi denied), as had General Magnus Malan; it also concluded that President Botha and the State Security Council had been aware of the scheme. In a related criminal trial, internal State Security Council documents from 1985 were released and showed that apartheid policymakers had viewed Buthelezi as a central component of the state&#x27;s strategy to recruit surrogate black allies who could act as an internal bulwark against the ANC. The codename of the operation, Marion, was derived from the word marionette and related terms, suggesting that Buthelezi was seen as the state&#x27;s marionette.

During the same period, the Goldstone Commission and Steyn Commission found evidence that officers of the apartheid police&#x27;s Security Branch had sold weapons to Inkatha between 1991 and 1994, during the peak of the ANC–Inkatha political violence, including AK-47s smuggled to Inkatha from outside the country; the Steyn Commission also found that the state had continued to provide military training to Inkatha members into the early 1990s. In addition, Walter Felgate, a former Inkatha leader, told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that Buthelezi had met monthly with Bureau for State Security operatives; Buthelezi vehemently denied that he had had any dealings with apartheid intelligence agencies except in his capacity as KwaZulu chief minister.

== Transition to democracy ==


Mandela&#x27;s release from prison in February 1990 coincided with the unbanning of the ANC and other black political organisations, and marked the beginning of the final, most substantive stage of the negotiations which ended apartheid in 1994. To mark this new milieu, in July 1990, Buthelezi relaunched Inkatha as the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), a multi-ethnic political party which would seek a nationwide following. The organisation also changed its colours (until then the ANC&#x27;s black, green, and gold), adding red and white to its flag. In 1990, Buthelezi claimed that the IFP had 1.9 million paid members, which would make it the largest party in South Africa, and he expected it to play a major role in the negotiations and ultimate settlement.

=== Political proposals ===

==== Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith ====
On 4 January 1974 in Mahlabatini, Buthelezi signed the Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith with Harry Schwarz, the Transvaal leader of the United Party, then South Africa&#x27;s official parliamentary opposition. The declaration was proposed as a five-point blueprint for racial peace in South Africa and called for political reform by non-violent means – specifically, through inclusive negotiations on constitutional proposals, including a bill of rights. It also endorsed the federal concept for South Africa. It was viewed as a breakthrough in white liberal circles and was endorsed by three homeland leaders – Cedric Phatudi (Lebowa), Lucas Mangope (Bophuthatswana) and Hudson Ntsanwisi (Gazankulu). Buthelezi later said that, once founded, Inkatha subscribed to the principles set out in the Mahlabtini Declaration.

==== Federalism and autonomy ====
By the 1980s, Buthelezi was a consistent advocate for political reforms instituting a federal system in South Africa, generally incorporating recognition for racial and ethnic identities – though from 1980 also including a common national citizenship and freedom of movement between regions – and therefore sometimes described as a form of consociationalism. Importantly, such proposals were compatible with Buthelezi&#x27;s ambivalent stance on the principle of one man, one vote. By 1981, he was arguing that, as a matter of &quot;practical politics&quot;, the principle would not be unobtainable in South Africa in the foreseeable future, given &quot;the reality of racial hatred, racial fear and entrenched power groups&quot;. In 1986 he told journalists that he favoured one man, one vote as an ideal, but that compromise would be necessary to avoid violence. This put him directly at odds with the ANC, whose central vision was for a unitary post-apartheid state under full majority rule.

During the negotiations on constitutional principles in 1991–1993, Buthelezi and the IFP continued to advocate for a federal system with a high degree of devolved regional autonomy and strong guarantees for the representation of minority interests, including the status of Zulu traditional leaders. Perhaps in support of the federal principle, during this period Buthelezi altered his rhetoric about KwaZulu&#x27;s status as a homeland. He began referring to KwaZulu as the &quot;Kingdom of KwaZulu&quot;, creating the false impression that the territory was continuous with Shaka&#x27;s independent Zulu kingdom – and therefore that the disbanding of the homeland would amount to an attempt to disband the Zulu nation. For example, he told the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;They [activists] talk about the homelands as if all the positions of homeland leaders are created by Pretoria. We were a sovereign nation until 1879, when we were defeated by the British. KwaZulu was always called KwaZulu.&quot; At one rally held by Buthelezi in 1992, King Zwelithini told the crowd that the ANC sought to &quot;wipe the Zulus off the face of the earth&quot;.

=== Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG) ===
From 1991 to 1993, Buthelezi led the IFP&#x27;s delegation to the multi-party constitutional negotiations at the Congress for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) and Multi-Party Negotiating Forum (MPNF), although he personally boycotted CODESA sessions in protest of the steering committee&#x27;s decision not to allow a separate delegation representing King Zwelithini. CODESA II broke down due to the ANC&#x27;s fury over what they perceived as the government&#x27;s &quot;third force&quot; involvement in the ongoing political violence, and negotiations only resumed after the ANC and NP government signed a bilateral Record of Understanding in September 1992. Buthelezi was furious that the IFP had been excluded from the agreement. In October 1992, he announced to a rally that the IFP would not participate in further negotiations and initiated the formation of the Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG). The group was an &quot;unlikely alliance&quot;, uniting the IFP with black traditionalists in other bantustans – Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana and Oupa Gqozo of Ciskei – and the white Conservative Party. Buthelezi himself later called it &quot;a motley gathering&quot;. Although he walked back his threat and the IFP did participate in the next stage of talks at the MPNF, COSAG continued to act as a lobbying group, aiming to ensure that its members were not sidelined or played off against each other, as they believed they had been in the past, and to promote a united front in advocating for the broad principles of federalism and political self-determination.

Notwithstanding, Buthelezi felt that the negotiations had become two-sided and that the IFP – and he personally – were being marginalised by the ANC and the NP. In June 1993, he led the IFP to walk out of the MPNF and announce its withdrawal from negotiations. It did not formally participate in any of the further negotiations or ratify the proposals that emerged from them. The Ciskei and Bophuthatswana governments followed the IFP in withdrawing in October 1993; at that time, COSAG was reconstituted as the Freedom Alliance, also incorporating far-right white groups of the Afrikaner Volksfront.

=== Election boycott and reversal ===
The Freedom Alliance was not involved in ratifying the interim Constitution in November 1993 and it announced that its members, including the IFP, would boycott the upcoming elections, to be held under universal suffrage. The IFP&#x27;s boycott, endorsed by the king, was perceived as a particular obstacle to successful elections. In April 1994, an international delegation of mediators, led by former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former British Foreign Secretary Peter Carington, visited South Africa to broker a resolution to the IFP&#x27;s election boycott, or, failing that, to persuade the ANC and NP to delay the elections to avert possible violence. Rejecting the call to delay, the ANC and NP offered Buthelezi additional constitutionally guarantees of the status of the Zulu monarchy and a process of post-election international mediation to resolve remaining disagreements about regional autonomy. The week before the election, Buthelezi announced that he had agreed to accept their proposal after negotiations by Kenyan diplomat Washington Okumu. Buthelezi said of the process, &quot;South Africa may well have been saved from disastrous consequences of unimaginable proportions&quot;. The ballot papers for the election had already been printed, so the IFP&#x27;s name – with the picture of Buthelezi, its presidential candidate – was added by means of a sticker attached manually to the bottom of each slip.

Under the interim Constitution, the bantustans, including KwaZulu, were disbanded and formally reintegrated into South Africa; KwaZulu was reintegrated with Natal to form the new province of KwaZulu-Natal. However, in March, Buthelezi had said of this shift, &quot;We were a nation-state long before there was any Pretoria... [The idea] that as a people, as a nation we will cease to exist on April 27 – I find it laughable, really.&quot;

== National government: 1994–2004 ==

=== 1994 election result and Government of National Unity ===
In the 1994 general election, Buthelezi was elected as a member of the new Parliament. Although the ANC won a comfortable national majority, the interim Constitution required it to form a multi-party government, in a form of transitional power-sharing. The Government of National Unity consisted of the ANC, the IFP, and (until 1996) the NP; the IFP had won enough parliamentary seats to be entitled to a cabinet seat, and Buthelezi was appointed Minister of Home Affairs in May. In the week before the election, Buthelezi had told a rally that the IFP would not join the power-sharing government because, &quot;Our struggle for your freedom has just begun&quot;. He said that after the election he was swayed by the majority view in his party: &quot;As a democrat I do what my people want, even if I don&#x27;t like it&quot;.

In a &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; article on the 20th anniversary of the 1994 election, Steven Friedman, who headed the Independent Electoral Commission&#x27;s information analysis department during the election, stated that the lack of a voters roll made verifying the results of the election difficult, and there were widespread accusations of cheating. Friedman characterised the election as a &quot;technical disaster but a political triumph&quot;, and intimated that the final results were as a result of a negotiated compromise, rather than being an accurate count of the votes cast, stating that it was impossible to produce an accurate result under the circumstances that the election was held. He wrote that he believed that the result of the election, which gave KwaZulu-Natal to the IFP; gave the National Party 20% of the vote share, and a deputy president position; and held the ANC back from the two-thirds majority with the ability to unilaterally write the final constitution, helped prevent a civil war.

==== Relations with the cabinet ====
As the constituent assembly drafted South Africa&#x27;s final Constitution, the IFP maintained its earlier negotiating position, seeking the devolution of a great deal of autonomy to the new province of KwaZulu-Natal and guarantees for the status of the Zulu traditional leadership; faced with opposition to this proposal, Buthelezi stormed out of the assembly in April 1995. There were also continued tensions between the ANC and IFP&#x27;s national leaders over the ongoing political violence in KwaZulu-Natal, and in 1997 Buthelezi terminated the IFP&#x27;s peace talks with the ANC, angered by what he perceived as the bias of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. However, Jakes Gerwel, who was Mandela&#x27;s cabinet secretary, said that Buthelezi remained cooperative within the cabinet even when he clashed with the ANC in public; he recalled that &quot;we spoke of the Wednesday Buthelezi and the Saturday Buthelezi, because he was so mild in the cabinet on Wednesdays and so aggressive at the IFP&#x27;s public meetings on Saturdays&quot;.

Mandela appointed Buthelezi acting president more than a dozen times in periods when both he and his deputy, Thabo Mbeki, were abroad. On the first such occasion in February 1997, Buthelezi told reporters that he saw his appointment as &quot;gesture toward reconciliation&quot;. On another occasion, in September 1998, Buthelezi was acting president when widespread rioting broke out in neighbouring Lesotho after a disputed election. Buthelezi deployed the South African National Defence Force across the border to protect Pakalitha Mosisili&#x27;s government, inaugurating a months-long military incursion by South Africa. In Buthelezi&#x27;s account, he consulted Mandela and Mbeki by telephone and they &quot;supported military intervention, but acknowledged that the final decision lay on my shoulders&quot;.

==== Rift with the royal house ====
Buthelezi&#x27;s first term as a cabinet minister was also marked by his estrangement from King Goodwill Zwelithini and his royal house. Observers viewed it as the result of Zwelithini&#x27;s attempts to distance himself from the IFP, both to reduce his dependence on Buthelezi and to bolster his public status as a true monarch, above party politics. This was partly facilitated by the establishment of the Ingonyama Trust, which had been set up just before the 1994 election as a result of negotiations between the NP and the IFP; it reduced the king&#x27;s direct financial dependence on the local political authority formerly headed by Buthelezi. For the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the first sign of Zwelithini&#x27;s desire for increased independence was during the election, when Zwelithini asked the national government to send South African soldiers to replace his palace guard, which was controlled by Buthelezi. After the election, Zwelithini&#x27;s frequent meetings with ANC leaders, including Mandela, were perceived as a snub to Buthelezi. Buthelezi publicly signalled his irritation in a speech in June, boasting of Zwelithini&#x27;s coronation, &quot;When I came to my maturity there was in fact no real Zulu king... I was personally behind all that.&quot; In subsequent months, he was rarely seen in public with Zwelithini.The tensions came to a head in September 1994, just months after the election. When Zwelithini invited Mandela to a traditional Shaka Day commemoration service, Buthelezi was angered that he had not been consulted; IFP supporters stormed the royal palace, disrupting a visit by Mandela, and Buthelezi organised a boycott of Zwelithini&#x27;s annual Reed Dance. On 21 September, the royal house announced that Zwelithini would &quot;sever all ties&quot; with Buthelezi and that all Shaka Day ceremonies would be cancelled. That weekend, Buthelezi presided over Shaka Day services held without the king for the first time ever; in his speech, he surprised observers by rejecting the concept of a sovereign Zulu state with an executive monarch.

Then, on the evening of 25 September, Buthelezi and his bodyguards got into a physical scuffle with Prince Sifiso Zulu, Zwelithini&#x27;s cousin and a member of the royal house. The incident was broadcast live on SABC, South Africa&#x27;s public broadcaster. Zulu had been in the middle of an appearance on a live television interview programme and had been criticising Buthelezi; Buthelezi happened to be in the same building for a different interview, had watched Zulu&#x27;s remarks on a monitor, and had stormed uninvited onto the chat show&#x27;s set with his bodyguards to confront Zulu, not realising that the cameras were still rolling. Buthelezi could be heard shouting &quot;Why are you saying these things about me?&quot; in Zulu and a gun was brandished by one of the parties. After Zulu fled the room, Buthelezi seized his chair and the television show resumed with a diatribe from Buthelezi. Buthelezi was widely criticised, including for transgressing the values of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and the following day he issued a public apology to the programme&#x27;s viewers.

In December 1994, Buthelezi was appointed chairperson of the new KwaZulu-Natal House of Traditional Leaders; his appointment was challenged by Zwelithini. Buthelezi saw the appointment as continuous with his earlier role in the province, but Zwelithini continued to insist that he was not and had never been traditional prime minister. By Shaka Day of 1997, three years later, there remained a rift between Buthelezi&#x27;s IFP and the royal house; Zwelithini still maintained that Buthelezi was not prime minister. Fellow Zulus Jacob Zuma and Ben Ngubane reportedly acted as government emissaries in attempting to mediate between them, including by trying to persuade Zwelithini to reinstate Buthelezi&#x27;s premiership. Buthelezi&#x27;s relationship with the king later improved and he was reinstated as traditional prime minister, but the royal family was never again as strongly aligned to Inkatha as it had been during apartheid.

=== Mbeki&#x27;s cabinet ===
The 1999 general election proceeded in terms of the final Constitution without any formal provision for power-sharing, but Mbeki, who became Mandela&#x27;s successor as president, chose informally to extend the Government of National Unity by maintaining IFP representation in his cabinet. Buthelezi therefore retained the Home Affairs portfolio for another term. Mbeki had offered him the position of deputy president, but on the condition that the IFP would help elect an ANC representative as Premier of KwaZulu-Natal; Buthelezi was unwilling to meet this condition. Mbeki later said that he had initially offered the deputy presidency unconditionally, but had been persuaded by his party to link it to the KwaZulu-Natal government; he said that Buthelezi, likewise, had been persuaded not to accept the proposal by his party, who would view it as &quot;dishonourable&quot; and as elevating Buthelezi personally at the expense of his organisation.

According to Mbeki&#x27;s biographer Mark Gevisser, Mbeki&#x27;s strategy towards Buthelezi was to &quot;bring him in, promise to see to his grievances once the country has made it to the other side of the rainbow and hope that the grievances recede as he busies himself with the authority and status accorded to him in the new democracy&quot;. He appointed Buthelezi as chairperson of two of the six cabinet committees. However, relations between the IFP and ANC, and therefore between Buthelezi and Mbeki, suffered, primarily due to ongoing discord in the ANC–IFP coalition that was operating simultaneously in the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government.

==== Truth Commission report ====
In addition to making findings about Buthelezi&#x27;s cooperation with apartheid security forces, the report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, published in 1999, was highly critical of Buthelezi and the IFP&#x27;s broader conduct during apartheid. The Commission reported &quot;overwhelming evidence that Inkatha/the IFP was the primary non-state perpetrator [of gross human rights violations], and that it was responsible for approximately 33 per cent of all the violations reported to the Commission&quot;. It said that the IFP leadership had &quot;created a climate of impunity by expressly or condoning gross human rights violations and other unlawful acts by members and supporters of the organisation&quot;. Buthelezi had not given comprehensive testimony to the commission or applied for amnesty – the Commission said that it had not subpoena&#x27;d him out of fear that &quot;Buthelezi&#x27;s appearance would give him a platform from which to oppose the Commission and would stoke the flames of violence in KwaZulu-Natal, as indeed he himself promised&quot;. He therefore might have been open to prosecution for the violations identified in the report.

Buthelezi continued to deny that he had ever &quot;ordered, ratified or condoned human rights violations&quot; and launched a lengthy legal battle to force the Commission to open its records to him and change its report. He and the Commission reached a settlement in early 2003, which involved the Commission making minor corrections to factual details and publishing a statement from Buthelezi as an appendix to the report.

==== Immigration dispute ====
Towards the end of the cabinet&#x27;s five-year term, Buthelezi and Mbeki had a serious spat over immigration regulations promulgated by Buthelezi on 8 March 2004. The existing immigration regulations had been suspended in March 2003 after the Cape High Court ruled that Buthelezi had not followed proper public consultation procedures when devising them; he published the new regulations in haste because of a court application lodged by an impatient citizen. However, Mbeki and Penuell Maduna, the Minister of Justice, had a range of complaints about the regulations, including that they were unconstitutional, established unduly lax immigration standards, would cause &quot;administrative chaos&quot;, and had not yet been discussed and agreed to by the rest of the cabinet.

Mbeki and Maduna applied for the court to declare the regulations invalid and void, and there was a comical exchange of press releases in which Maduna&#x27;s department declared that the regulations would not be implemented just as Buthelezi&#x27;s department declared that they would be. The case went to trial, and Mbeki&#x27;s legal counsel claimed that Buthelezi&#x27;s actions had been &quot;carefully orchestrated to circumvent the cabinet process&quot; and that he had &quot;deliberately misled the court as well as President Mbeki&quot;. The judge found no grounds to believe that Buthelezi had been deceitful but agreed with Mbeki that the regulations required collective cabinet approval; they were set aside. In 2007, Buthelezi reflected of the incident, &quot;I am not aware of any world precedent in which a president not only sued his own minister, but went so far as trying to get a cost order against him in his personal capacity&quot;.

=== 2004 election ===
Mbeki did not appoint Buthelezi to his second cabinet when he was re-elected in the 2004 general election, and the IFP joined the opposition benches – both in the national Parliament and in KwaZulu-Natal. In a statement upon his departure, Buthelezi said:At times it has also not been easy for us to participate in [Mbeki&#x27;s] coalition Cabinet... [But] I think history will credit him for his vision in promoting reconciliation between the IFP and the ANC in this manner... It would also be unkind of me on an occasion such as this one, to mention the low moments and the times when I felt that this Cabinet or my own president was unfair with me, or not sufficiently confident in my competence, expertise and good faith in the exercising of my ministerial functions. I would rather mention the many positive moments which we shared in this Cabinet, as together we attended to the concerns of the country.The &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; reported that Mbeki had offered two deputy ministerial posts to mid-level IFP leaders, but that this proposal – rejected by the IFP – had stoked, rather than ameliorated, tensions between him and Buthelezi.

== Opposition leader: 2004–2019 ==

The KwaZulu-Natal Traditional Leadership and Governance Act of 2005 further entrenched the status of the KwaZulu-Natal House of Traditional Leaders as an advisory body attached to the KwaZulu-Natal provincial legislature with the power to make non-binding recommendations about legislation related to traditional leadership and governance; Buthelezi remained its chairperson. In addition, he retained his role as leader of the IFP and his seat in the Parliament. In Parliament plenaries, he intervened frequently to chastise the Economic Freedom Fighters for a lack of decorum and warned the government against land expropriation without compensation. He also attempted to quell xenophobic sentiment in KwaZulu-Natal.

=== Gavin Woods report ===
In August 2005, there was a minor media scandal concerning an internal IFP discussion document entitled &quot;The IFP: Crisis of Identity and of Public Support&quot;. It had been drafted in October 2004 by Gavin Woods, one of the IFP&#x27;s most senior MPs, at the request of the IFP&#x27;s national parliamentary caucus. The document was highly critical of the party&#x27;s trajectory, describing it as having had &quot;no vision, no mission or philosophical base, no clear national ambitions or direction and no articulated ideological basis&quot; since around 1987, and as having become &quot;increasingly reactionary, defensive and internalised&quot;, prone to &quot;a persecution- and conspiracy-dominated analysis&quot;. It was perceived as indirectly critical of Buthelezi – among other things, Woods warned that Buthelezi must be treated as &quot;the leader of a political party and not the political party itself&quot;.

Sources told News24 that the document had been well received by the parliamentary caucus when first tabled in a meeting in which Buthelezi was not present, but that Buthelezi had been &quot;livid&quot; about the report and in a subsequent caucus meeting had read from a prepared statement attacking &quot;the author of the document&quot; without naming Woods. The &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; reported that Buthelezi recalled all the copies and ordered them shredded to keep them from the media. He told the press that he felt Woods had &quot;mis-assessed the situation in the party&quot;; Woods himself released a statement in which he said that the media had misrepresented the report and overstated the extent to which it blamed Buthelezi for the party&#x27;s problems. The saga received particular attention because it coincided with the suspension of the IFP&#x27;s national chairperson, Ziba Jiyane, for having warned the party against the dangers of &quot;dictatorial leadership&quot;; Jiyane subsequently resigned from the party.

=== 2009 election and aftermath ===
The IFP performed poorly in the 2009 general election and lost seats in KwaZulu-Natal to the ANC, whose presidential candidate, Jacob Zuma, was Zulu. Groups within the IFP began to lobby for leadership change. In particular, the party&#x27;s youth wing, the Inkatha Youth Brigade, lobbied for chairperson Zanele Magwaza-Msibi to take over from Buthelezi. However, even IFP conservatives looked for alternatives: many supported secretary general Musa Zondi. Several youth activists were expelled from the party during the subsequent factionalist agitation, and the entire leadership of the KwaZulu-Natal Youth Brigade was suspended in May 2009.

The KwaZulu-Natal House of Traditional Leaders was up for re-election in the same period, but Buthelezi withdrew ahead of the vote, saying that he would not stand for re-election as chairperson. His withdrawal followed an announcement by the Independent Electoral Commission which suggested that he was not the frontrunner for the position: Bhekisisa Bhengu (who was ultimately elected to succeed Buthelezi) had received 28 nominations against Buthelezi&#x27;s 24. Buthelezi claimed that ANC leaders, including newly elected President Zuma and Premier Zweli Mkhize, had induced traditional leaders to withdraw their support for him in exchange for bribes. The ANC said the allegation was baseless and defamatory.

The IFP was also due to convene a national elective conference, in July 2009, to elect its leadership, but the conference was postponed indefinitely; Buthelezi&#x27;s critics, especially in the Youth Brigade, said that it was a delaying tactic intended to buy his supporters time to shore up his re-election as IFP president. In September, Youth Brigade members clashed with Buthelezi&#x27;s supporters outside the IFP headquarters in Durban, necessitating police intervention. In January 2011, when Magwaza-Msibi left the IFP to form the National Freedom Party, the &quot;Daily Maverick&quot; observed, &quot;The revolt seems to be inspired by the old complaint that Mangosuthu Buthelezi... refuses to hand power over to anyone.&quot; Buthelezi linked the breakaway to an ANC conspiracy, and his attitude towards the ANC during this period has been described as paranoid. In February 2013, he confronted President Zuma in the National Assembly, saying that Zuma and some of his ministers had advised him that it was time for him to retire.

Following a series of victories for the IFP in local by-elections, the party&#x27;s National General Conference, initially scheduled for July 2009, was finally held in Ulundi in December 2012, in the same week as the ANC&#x27;s 53rd National Conference. Buthelezi was re-elected unopposed as IFP president, but the conference also signalled the beginning of a leadership succession process by amending the party&#x27;s constitution to create a deputy president post; Buthelezi said that he would stay on to oversee a &quot;smooth transition&quot;. Nonetheless, the IFP lost further ground in the 2014 general election and lost its status as the official opposition in KwaZulu-Natal to the Democratic Alliance (DA).

=== Succession ===
On 20 January 2019, Buthelezi announced that he would not seek re-election to another term as party president of the IFP, pointing out that he had been intending to step down since 2006. Since 2017, it had been understood that Velenkosini Hlabisa was his preferred successor. With Hlabisa as the party&#x27;s candidate for KwaZulu-Natal Premier, the IFP&#x27;s performed well in the 2019 general election and usurped the DA as the official opposition in KwaZulu-Natal. Although Buthelezi had been expected to retire from Parliament in 2019 after 25 years in his seat, he remained on the IFP party list and was re-elected to his seat for another term. As expected, the IFP&#x27;s 2019 National General Conference, held in August, elected Hlabisa unopposed to succeed Buthelezi; he stepped down from the party presidency after almost 45 years in the position.

In subsequent years, it also appeared that Buthelezi might retire from his position as traditional prime minister – although he became heavily involved in the royal family&#x27;s succession battle in 2021 and 2022 after King Goodwill Zwelithini died in March 2021. Although Prince Misuzulu Zwelithini was the heir apparent, and had Buthelezi&#x27;s strong backing, his claim to succession was fiercely challenged over the next year. Buthelezi was intimately involved in negotiating the battle and on multiple occasions his critics within the royal house accused him of exceeding his authority. Misuzulu prevailed. On at least two occasions, including at his recognition ceremony in late October 2022, Buthelezi advised the new King Misuzulu that he was entitled to appoint a new traditional prime minister, although he offered to continue to serve in the position until a replacement was appointed. According to Buthelezi, he had often urged Misuzulu&#x27;s predecessor to replace him, too, to no avail.

== Personality and political style ==
Buthelezi&#x27;s political trademark was his infamously lengthy speeches: as of 2023, he retained a Guinness World Record he had won in 1993 for the longest ever legislative speech. That year, his opening speech to the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly lasted from 12 to 29 March; the address ran to 427 pages and was delivered partly in English and partly in Zulu. The political cartoonist Zapiro, speaking from personal experience, described him as &quot;the most litigious politician in South Africa&quot;; he fought a long-running battle to discredit Mzala Nxumalo after he wrote a critical biography of Buthelezi, &quot;Chief With a Double Agenda,&quot; in 1988.

==Personal life and health==
Buthelezi married Irene Audrey Thandekile Mzila (1929–2019), whom he met at a wedding in January 1949 when she was a nursing student from Johannesburg. They married on 2 July 1952 and had three sons, five daughters, and several grandchildren. Their children were Princess Phumzile Nokuphiwa (born 1953), Prince Ntuthukoyezwe Zuzifa (born 1955), Mabhuku Sinikwakonke (1957–1966), Mandisi Sibukakonke (1958–2004), Lethuxolo Bengitheni (1959–2008), Nelisuzulu Benedict (1961–2004), Phumaphesheya Gregory (1963–2012), and Princess Sibuyiselwe Angela (1969–2024).

Buthelezi was a practising member of the Anglican Church. He said that he was occasionally put under pressure to take on additional wives, in line with customary Zulu polygamy, but had followed Christian edicts in remaining monogamous. His traditional residence was at kwaPhindangene in Ulundi in northern KwaZulu-Natal, and he was a fan of classical and choral music. He contracted COVID-19 twice, in August 2020 and December 2021, and was hospitalised with hypertension in January 2022.

===Death and state funeral===
On 1 August 2023, Buthelezi was reportedly hospitalised due to back problems. He was subsequently released from hospital on 2 September, and died on 9 September at his home in Ulundi, at the age of 95.

On 16 September 2023, he was honoured with a category 1 state funeral in Ulundi. His funeral was attended by prominent politicians and royalties including EFF leader Julius Malema and his former deputy Floyd Shivambu; UDM president Bantu Holomisa; former presidents Thabo Mbeki, Kgalema Motlanthe, and Jacob Zuma; Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and President Cyril Ramaphosa. He was buried at a family cemetery next to his house in Kwaphindangene later that same day.

He was succeeded as head of the clan by his son Zuzifa Buthelezi.

== Honours ==
Buthelezi was made a Knight Commander of the Star of Africa for Outstanding Leadership by Liberian President William Tolbert in 1975 and appointed to the French National Order of Merit in 1981; King Goodwill Zwelithini awarded him the King&#x27;s Cross Award in 1989 and the King Shaka Gold Medal in 2001. He has been awarded four honorary doctorates in law, from the University of Zululand in 1976, the University of Cape Town in 1978, Florida&#x27;s Tampa University in 1985, and Boston University in 1986. He was named Man of the Year by the Institute of Management Consultants in 1972 and by the &quot;Financial Mail&quot; in 1985, and Newsmaker of the Year by the South African Society of Journalists in 1973 and Pretoria Press Club in 1985. He was patron of the Mangosuthu University of Technology and is also a former Chancellor of the University of Zululand, a ceremonial position to which he was appointed in 1979; he was the first black person to hold the title.

His other awards included a Citation for Leadership from the District of Columbia Council (1976), the AFL-CIO&#x27;s George Meany Human Rights Award (1982), the Key to the City of Birmingham, Alabama (1989), the American Conservative Union&#x27;s Charlton Heston Courage Under Fire Award (2001), the order of St. Markhus of the Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa (2009), the order of St. Michael and All Angels of the Diocese of Zululand in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa (2010), the order of Simon of Cyrene from the Bishops of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa (2010), and the Everlasting Gospel Leadership Award from the Brotherhood of the Cross and Star (2011).

<text>Wolfgang Metzger (born 22 July 1899 in Heidelberg, Germany; died 20 December 1979 in 
Bebenhausen, Germany) is considered one of the main representatives of Gestalt psychology (Gestalt theory) in Germany.

Metzger&#x27;s most widely acclaimed work is &quot;Psychologie: Die Entwicklung ihrer Grundannahmen seit der Einführung des Experiments&quot; (Psychology: The development of basic principles since the introduction of the experimental method). It portrays systematically the foundations of psychology, including the different kinds of psychological reality, the problems associated with reference systems, order, and much more. Pivotal in its discussions is the cumulative knowledge, at that time, of the entire Gestalt school.

==Biography==
Metzger was a student and associate of the founders of the Berlin school of Gestalt theory, Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka. Metzger became Max Wertheimer&#x27;s assistant in Frankfurt/Main in the 1930s and his successor when the Nazis forced Wertheimer out. Early in the 1940s Metzger became chairman at Münster, a position he held until his retirement.

Wolfgang Metzger joined the SA in 1933, and became a member of the NSDAP in 1937.

The early major work &quot;Gesetze des Sehens&quot; (Laws of Seeing) first appeared in serial part issues, edited by the &quot;Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft&quot; in Frankfurt. Expanded editions were printed in 1936, 1954, and 1975. In this work Metzger supplemented his collection of phenomena from everyday perception and the fine arts, always endeavoring to find ever more compelling illustrations for the Gestalt point of view. As Heinz Heckhausen has pointed out this work is a masterpiece for those who come to it without an intense background in the psychology of perception; in a nontechnical style Metzger moves the reader toward a deeper experience, and sometimes an altered conception, of the visual world.

Following World War II Metzger devoted increasing energy to applied questions, especially those having to do with child-rearing, classroom education, and psychotherapy. His guiding principles in these applied endeavors were developed in his last two books, &quot;Schöpferische Freiheit&quot; (Productive freedom, 1949, 1962) and &quot;Psychologie in der Erziehung&quot; (Psychology in education, 1971). The theoretical starting point of these works is again Gestalt psychology with its assumption of a natural, nonforced order in nature, which led him to make his observations on the virtues of a theme of freedom among the goals of education. Metzger became eventually an outspoken advocate of Adlerian psychology with which he had become acquainted during his Berlin days through Fritz Künkel and later through Oliver Brachfeld who was in Münster from 1960 to 1965. Together with Brachfeld he founded in 1964 the German &quot;Alfred Adler Society&quot; which became in 1970 the &quot;German Society for Individual Psychology&quot;.

Metzger was president of the 16th International Congress for Psychology in 1960 in Bonn. From 1962 until 1964, he was president of the &quot;Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychologie&quot;. He was also highly committed to activities associated with his membership in the &quot;Association de Psychologie de la Langue Française&quot;. Metzger&#x27;s legacy is carried forth in the &quot;Society for Gestalt Theory and its Applications&quot; (GTA), an international multidisciplinary organization, of which he was honorary chairman.

<text>21 Jump Street is an American police procedural drama television series created by Patrick Hasburgh and Stephen J. Cannell for the Fox Broadcasting Company. It aired from April 12, 1987 to April 27, 1991, spanning 103 episodes over five seasons; the final season aired on first-run syndication. The series focuses on a squad of youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in schools, gangs, and other teenage venues. It was originally going to be titled &quot;Jump Street Chapel&quot;, after the deconsecrated church building in which the unit has its headquarters, but was changed at Fox&#x27;s request so as not to mislead viewers into thinking it was a religious program.

The series was produced by the two creators&#x27; production companies; Cannell retains all intellectual property rights of the series. Executive producers included Hasburgh, Cannell, Steve Beers, and Bill Nuss. The show was an early hit for the fledgling Fox network and was created to attract a younger audience. The final season aired in first-run syndication mainly on local Fox affiliates. It was later rerun on the FX cable network from 1996 to 1998.

The series provided a spark to Johnny Depp&#x27;s acting career, garnering him national recognition as a teen idol. Depp found this status irritating, but he continued on the series under his contract and was paid $45,000 per episode. Eventually, he was released from his contract after the fourth season.

A spin-off series, &quot;Booker&quot;, was produced for the character of Dennis Booker (Richard Grieco); it ran for only one season, from September 24, 1989, to May 6, 1990. A film adaptation directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller was released on March 16, 2012. The film is set in the same continuity as the series, with Johnny Depp, Holly Robinson, and Peter DeLuise reprising their characters in cameo appearances. Richard Grieco and Dustin Nguyen also have cameos in the 2014 film sequel &quot;22 Jump Street&quot;.

==Premise==
The series focuses on a group of rookie police officers headquartered at the eponymous address. These young officers all have especially youthful appearances, allowing them to pass for teenagers. Their assignments frequently consist of undercover work in high schools or, less commonly, colleges, where they generally investigate drug trafficking and other criminal activities. The show&#x27;s plots cover issues such as alcoholism, hate crimes, gang violence, drug abuse, homophobia, AIDS, child abuse, and sexual promiscuity. Similarly, each problem is often solved by the end of the hour-long episode, giving an implicit moral about a particular activity&#x27;s impact. When the show originally aired, some episodes were followed immediately by public service announcements (PSAs) featuring cast members.

==Episodes==

==Cast==


Jeff Yagher was originally cast as Officer Tom Hanson in the pilot. He was replaced after the original pilot episode was filmed, and his scenes were reshot with Johnny Depp. Midway through the first season, Frederic Forrest was replaced by Steven Williams. On the show, Forrest&#x27;s character Richard Jenko is killed by a drunk driver.

Johnny Depp left the series at the end of the fourth season, but was credited in the first two episodes of the fifth season, despite not having appeared.

David Barry Gray&#x27;s character was introduced at the end of the fourth season and starred in two episodes of season five with Alexandra Powers. Both episodes were filmed before the fourth season had ended but were not shown until the start of season five. Neither actor was approached in regards to portraying their character in the show&#x27;s fifth and final season.
Michael DeLuise joined the cast in the middle of the fifth season and stayed on until late in the season.

===Guest stars===

Some notable guest stars on the series include:
Dom DeLuise (Peter&#x27;s father), Josh Brolin, Mindy Cohn, Bridget Fonda, Bobby Rodriguez, Jada Pinkett, Brad Pitt, Vince Vaughn, Barney Martin, Dann Florek, Blair Underwood, Shannen Doherty, John Waters, Rosie Perez, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Mario Van Peebles, Christina Applegate, Pauly Shore, David DeLuise (Peter&#x27;s brother), Bradley Gregg, Jason Priestley, Christine Elise, Christopher Titus, Kurtwood Smith, Peri Gilpin, Shannon Tweed, Sarah Buxton, David Paymer, Diedrich Bader, Russell Wong, Kelly Hu, Tim Russ, Thomas Haden Church, Sherilyn Fenn, Rob Estes, Ray Walston, R.J. Williams, Robyn Lively, Gloria Reuben, Billy Jayne, Jason Lively, Billy Warlock, Peter Berg, Larenz Tate, Tracy Griffith, and Ed O&#x27;Neill.

==Production==

===Filming===
Set in a fictional city and state (Metropolis, Evergreen State) in the United States, the series was primarily filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. It was one of the first major television series to use Vancouver as a filming location and helped to establish the city as a center for film production.

===Reception===
&quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, along with &quot;Married... with Children&quot; and &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, debuted in the spring of 1987. All three shows were hits with audiences and helped to establish the then-newly launched Fox network. &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; was the first hit series for the Fox network. In August, &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; became the first Fox series to win its timeslot against a Big Three network series. In the United Kingdom, it was shown on the similarly nascent, and interrelated, Sky One, which had yet to reach a sizeable audience.

==Broadcast history==
Season 4 was the last season to air on the Fox network. In the commentary provided with the Season 5 DVD set, Peter DeLuise said that Fox had decided to cancel the show after Season 4 because the ratings had fallen below a set limit. Following this season, Johnny Depp and Dustin Nguyen left the show. The departure of their characters was never fully explained in the narrative of the TV series, but in the movie it is explained that Officer Hanson was transferred to the DEA and was later joined by Officer Penhall. The &quot;Booker&quot; spin-off crossover episode, &quot;Wheels and Deals – Part One,&quot; is included with &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;&#x27;s syndication package, and is also included on the Season 4 DVD set.

Officer Dean Garrett (David Barry Gray) makes his first appearance in &quot;Everyday is Christmas.&quot; As it became more difficult for the original Jump Street cast to pass as high-school students, younger actors were brought in, intended to be &quot;youthful&quot; replacements in order to allow the show to maintain its original premise of young-looking cops posing as high-school students.

==Home media==
Anchor Bay Entertainment released all five seasons of &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; on DVD in Region 1 between 2004 and 2006.

On October 14, 2009, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to several Stephen J. Cannell series, including &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, and subsequently re-released the first four seasons. In addition, Mill Creek also released &quot;21 Jump Street: The Complete Series&quot;, an 18-disc collection featuring all 103 episodes of the series on DVD on July 27, 2010.

On July 29, 2022, Visual Entertainment released &quot;21 Jump Street: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

In Region 2, Anchor Bay Entertainment released all 5 seasons on DVD in the UK. They also released a complete series set on March 5, 2012.

In Region 4, Madman Entertainment released all five seasons on DVD in Australia. They also released a complete series collection on May 1, 2013.

In Region 2, Pidax Film released a complete series set box set on September 18, 2020, in Germany with all original music intact. German and English audio tracks.

==Film adaptation==
On March 16, 2012, a feature film based on the television series from Sony Pictures and Metro Goldwyn Mayer was released starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum (who are also executive producers) and directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller with the screenplay written by Michael Bacall from a story by both Hill and Bacall. Johnny Depp, Peter DeLuise, and Holly Robinson briefly reprise their roles as Tom Hanson, Doug Penhall, and Judy Hoffs.

Described in concept by Hill as an &quot;R-rated, insane, &quot;Bad Boys&quot;-meets-John Hughes-type movie,&quot; the film departs from the dramatic style of the series and instead features a comedic tone. The film and series are also set in the same continuity. A sequel titled &quot;22 Jump Street&quot; was released in 2014.

<doc id="478153" wikidata="Q5640528" url="?curid=478153" title="Hakka hill song">
<text>Hakka hill songs (; ) are rural songs sung in the Hakka language by the Hakka people. They are probably one of the better known elements that reflect Hakka culture, regarded by many as the &#x27;pearl of Hakka Literature&#x27;.

Hakka hill songs vary in theme from love to personal conduct. In the past, they are said to have been used as a method of courting between young men and women. The songs are also used as a form of communication at a distance. Since Hakka people mostly live in hilly areas, song is used as a better means of communication than spoken words. The melody of Hakka hill songs tend to have higher pitch so the sound can travel farther.

They can be made up impromptu as a means to communicate with others or to express oneself. The lyrics can also be made to contain riddles, as a game or a more competitive nature. The challenger will answer the riddle in the form of song of similar melody.

They are popular in Meizhou Prefecture in the northeastern part of Guangdong Province, the western part of Fujian Province, the southern part of Jiangxin Province and the northern part of Taiwan, places where the Hakka live. The Moiyen (Meixian) county, home to many Hakkas in Guangdong, hold Hakka hill songs competitions inviting Hakka competitors from all over China to participate.
== History ==
The original composers of Hakka hill songs can be difficult to find out as the songs, being a kind of oral literature, have been widespread and orally passed from generation to generation. The tradition, however, most likely originated from &quot;Classic of Poetry (The Book of Songs)&quot;, which influenced Chinese literature for thousands of years. Other than its original influence, Hakka hill songs had continually developed during the migration of the Hakka. Many different cultures during their migration have influenced these songs, such as the cultures of Wu State and Chu State, as well as the culture of the She peoples and the Yao peoples. The songs are commonly associated with an ancient Hakka dance which entails wearing a rodent (primarily a rat) pelt on the dancers head while moving seductively throughout the room, telling the story of the great migration.

The long Hakka migration finally ended during the Ming and Qing dynasties, and the Hakka settled in the mountainous area of South Central China between Jiangxi, Guangdong and Fujian provinces. It was further influenced by the daily work of the Hakka on the mountainside: mountain singing was a way to socialise with one another and to alleviate the pain of hard work. The singing was at one point suppressed by an official ban from the government of the Qing Dynasty. However, despite the ban, mountain songs were often sung in secret, carrying a rebellious spirit between the lines, even though outwardly most of the songs were seemingly only about everyday topics such as love and labouring in the fields.

== Types and characteristics ==
The melody of Hakka hill songs vary from area to area since the Hakka are widely spread in different regions of China and their dialect they speak differs in many respects. For example, Meizhou, a well-known Hakka area in Guangdong Province once had several unique tunes in this region, never to mention about the different tunes in other areas of Guangdong such as Xingning, Wuhua, Dabu, Fengshun, Jieyang, Zijin, Heyuan, Huiyang and others in the north and west of Guangdong. Due to this phenomenon, this type of singing can also be referred as the &quot;Jiu Qiang Shi Ba Diao&quot; ().

The so-called nine airs are the &quot;Hailu&quot;, &quot;Sixian&quot;, &quot;Raoping&quot;, &quot;Fenglu&quot;, &quot;Meixian&quot;, &quot;Songkou&quot;, &quot;Guangdong&quot;, &quot;Guangnan&quot; and &quot;Guangxi&quot; air. Likewise, the eighteen tunes are the &quot;Pingban&quot;, &quot;Shangezi&quot;, &quot;Laoshange&quot; (also the &quot;South Wind&quot; tune), &quot;Siniange&quot;, &quot;Bingzige&quot;, &quot;Shibamo&quot;, &quot;Jianjianhua&quot; (also the &quot;Ancients in December&quot; tune), &quot;Chuyizhao&quot;, &quot;Taohuakai&quot;, &quot;Shangshancaica&quot;, &quot;Guanziren&quot;, &quot;Naowujin&quot;, &quot;Songjinchai&quot;, &quot;Dahaitang&quot;, &quot;Kuliniang&quot;, &quot;Xishoujin&quot;, &quot;Tiaomaijiu&quot;, &quot;Taohuaguodu&quot; (also the &quot;Chengchuange&quot; tune) and &quot;Xiuxiangbao&quot; tune. However, there are actually more tunes than aforementioned, but the others are not recorded and so remain unknown.

Despite all of the differences between their tunes, Hakka hill songs share a common feature which is that one Hakka hill song can be sung by any Hakka from other regions. There is no rigid rule of singing skills and the length of the tune depends on the singer&#x27;s own arrangement. Hakka hill songs incorporate seventeen types of Hakka flat intonation and seven more types of oblique intonation. Each stanza consists of four lines, each with seven syllables and each line except the third often include flat intonation.

== Example ==
This poem, titled &quot;A Girl with Her Three-Year-Old Husband&quot;, tells a story about a girl who was born on the outskirts of Meizhou town, suffering due to an arranged marriage. She was sold to a family at a very young age and had to marry her then-future mother-in-law&#x27;s son she gave birth to when the girl was sixteen years old. The son was three years old by the time the girl turned eighteen years of age, and at that time it agonised her having to sleep with her future husband. The first stanza quotes to what she sang on one night about that resentment.

The second stanza is the reply from one of her neighbours, an old lady who heard what the girl had sung that night. The final stanza is the immediate response from the girl who then became even more begrudged after hearing the lady&#x27;s words, which then deeply moved the old lady as she herself felt very sorry for the girl&#x27;s suffering:

&lt;poem&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;

;Translation
&lt;poem&gt;
Little three-year-old husband,
sleeping carelessly on the bed,
every night I have to serve him,
and he is ruining my whole life.

You shall become wise, my dear girl,
you husband shall by ten years grow,
and the waning moon on the early part of each month,
will be a full moon by the fifteenth and sixteenth days.

You know, my dear aunt,
when that boy grows up, I too shall grow old,
the flower is blooming and the other has withered away,
the full moon has risen and the sun has fallen.
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>The Braekel or Brakel is a traditional Belgian breed of chicken. It is thought to have originated in the area of Brakel, in the Flemish province of East Flanders, for which it is named. There is a bantam version of the Braekel. The Campine of the United Kingdom derives from it.

== History ==

The Braekel apparently derives from same extended population of gold and silver chickens which gave rise to the closely similar Ostfriesische Möwe and Westfälischer Totleger breeds. It is thought to have originated in the area of Brakel, in the Flemish province of East Flanders, and particularly in the villages of Opbrakel and Nederbrakel; and to have spread along the valleys of the Scheldt and Dender rivers, in East Flanders and into Hainaut.

In 1884, two distinct types were recognised as separate breeds: the larger Braekel of Flanders, and a smaller and lighter type from the Campine region to the east. In 1898, a Braekel breeders&#x27; society was established in Nederbrakel, and a breed standard was published. In 1926, the separate Braekel and Campine breeds were brought together again under a single breed standard.

In the United Kingdom a very different Campine breed was created, probably through cross-breeding with pencilled Hamburgs. The principal difference is that cock birds display hen-feathering, which was not seen in the Belgian type. 

The Braekel population declined during and after the Second World War and it is a rare breed. For Belgium, population numbers reported to DAD-IS were in 1994 and 125 in 2013; the local conservation status was listed in 2023 as &#x27;unknown&#x27;. The Braekel is also reported from the United Kingdom, where in 2023 the conservation status was &#x27;unknown&#x27;, and from Germany, where in 2023 the reported population was 882 and the conservation status &#x27;at risk&#x27;.

== Characteristics ==

The Braekel is a light breed; cocks weigh some and hens Bantam cocks weigh about and hens about . Ring sizes are and for standard-sized cocks and hens, and and respectively for bantams.

A straight banding pattern of the feathers and a uniform solid neck colour are characteristic of the Braekel. The Entente Européenne lists ten colour variants, of which only the gold and the silver are recognised. 

== Use ==

Braekel hens lay well from the age of six or seven months, and in a year may produce approximately 180 white-shelled eggs weighing .

<doc id="478168" wikidata="Q656308" url="?curid=478168" title="Allobroges">
<text>The Allobroges (Gaulish: *&quot;Allobrogis&quot;, &#x27;foreigner, exiled&#x27;; ) were a Gallic people dwelling in a large territory between the Rhône river and the Alps during the Iron Age and the Roman period.

The Allobroges came relatively late to Gaul compared to most other tribes of Gallia Narbonensis; they first appear in historical records in connection with Hannibal&#x27;s crossing of the Alps in 218 BC. Their territory was subsequently annexed to Rome in 121 BC by Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus. An attempted revolt was crushed by Gaius Pomptinus in 61 BC. However, they had rejected the second Catilinarian conspiracy in 63 BC. During the Gallic Wars, the Allobroges did not side with Vercingetorix at the Battle of Alesia in 52 BC.

== Name ==

=== Attestations ===
They are mentioned as &quot;A̓llobrígōn&quot; (Ἀλλοβρίγων) by Polybius (2nd c. BC) and Strabo (early 1st c. AD), &quot;Allobroges&quot; by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC) and Livy (late 1st c. BC), &quot;A̓llóbriges&quot; ( Ἀλλόβριγες), &quot;Allóbrigas&quot; (Ἀλλόβριγας) and &quot;Allobrígōn&quot; (Ἀλλοβρίγων) by Appian (2nd c. AD), &quot;A̓llóbriges&quot; (Ἀλλόβριγες; Ἀλλόβρυγες, Ἀλλόβρογες) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD), and as &quot;Allobrogas&quot; by Orosius (early 5th c. AD).

=== Etymology ===
The ethnonym &quot;Allobroges&quot; is a Latinized form of the Gaulish *&quot;Allobrogis&quot; ( &quot;Allobrox&quot;), which literally means &#x27;those from another country&#x27; or &#x27;those from the other frontier&#x27;, that is to say the &#x27;foreigners&#x27; or the &#x27;exiled&#x27;. The personal names &quot;Allo-brogicus&quot; and &quot;Allo-broxus&quot; are related; they all stem from the Celtic root &quot;allo&quot;- (&#x27;other, second&#x27;) attached to &quot;brogi-&quot; (&#x27;territory, region, march&#x27;). This may give further evidence of the relatively recent coming of the Allobroges in the region. Their name can indeed be contrasted with that of the &quot;Nitio-broges&quot; (&#x27;indigenous&#x27;), who lived further southwest on the middle Garonne river.

The Gaulish *&quot;Allobrogis&quot; is cognate with the Welsh &quot;allfro&quot; (&#x27;foreigner, exiled&#x27;) – both stemming from the Celtic compound *&quot;allo-mrogis&quot; –, and with the Germanic &quot;alja-markiz&quot; (&#x27;the foreigner&#x27;), found in an inscription from Karstad, which may indicate a Celtic-Germanic correspondence of the term.

A mountain in the Mont Blanc massif is still called &quot;Pointe Allobrogia&quot;, which could be the remnant of an ancient territorial claim made by the Gallic people.

==Geography==
=== Territory ===
The territory of the Allobroges, which is known as &quot;Allobrogia&quot;, stretched between the Isère and the Rhône rivers, the Lacus Lemannus (Lake Geneva) and the Alps. By the mid-1st century BC, they also possessed a piece of land north of the Rhône river, between modern Lyon and Geneva, whose later status remains uncertain. During the Roman period, the &quot;civitas&quot; &quot;Viennensium&quot; covered an area of around 13,000 km2, one of the largest in Gaul.

The Allobroges lived east of the Segusiavi and the Vellavi, south of the Ambarri and Sequani, north of the Segovellauni, Vertamocorii, Vocontii, Tricorii, Ucennii, Graioceli and Ceutrones, and southwest of the Helvetii and Veragri.

=== Settlements ===
==== Solonion ====
Until its destruction by the Romans in 61 BC, the main settlement of the Allobroges was known as Solonion, possibly corresponding to the modern village of Salagnon, near Bourgoin-Jallieu, or else to Montmiral, near Saint-Marcellin.

==== Vienna ====
The site of Vienna (modern Vienne, France), situated at the confluence of the Gère and Rhône rivers, was occupied by the Celts since the early 4th century BC. It served as a small river port protected by two oppida, one on the Pipet hill, and one on the Sainte-Blandine hill, and perhaps surrounded by a wall. Although it remained a village until the 1st century BC, Vienna held a central position at a trading crossroad between northern Gaul, the Italian Peninsula and the Mediterranean Sea, before it was eventually outshined by the nearby Lugdunum during the reign of Augustus (27 BC–14 AD). Until that time, Vienna was indeed the only place in the region where the Rhône could be crossed by foot. Since its creation, the port had been maintaining trade relations with the Greek colony of Massalia, on the Mediterranean coast.

After the destruction of Solonion by the Romans in 61 BC, the Allobrogian chieftains decided to move their place of residence to Vienna. Around 50 BC, the settlement possibly became a colonia Latina, leading to the immigration of settlers from the Italian Peninsula. According to most scholars, after their expulsion by the local Allobroges in March 44 BC during the political troubles that followed the assassination of Caesar, those Roman settlers moved further north, where Munatius Plancus founded for them the colony of Lugdunum the following year. Alternatively, some scholars date the expulsion of the settlers to the Allobrogian revolt of 62–62, and contend that Vienna was made into a colony only later at the time of Octavian.

Under Octavian, sometime between 40 and 27 BC, Vienna became known as &quot;Colonia Iulia&quot; &quot;Viennensium&quot;, then was made into a colonia Romana known as &quot;Colonia Iulia Augusta Florentia&quot; &quot;Vienna (or Viennensium)&quot;, either under Augustus (ca. 15 BC) or Caligula (ca. 40 AD). In 35 AD, the Allobrogian citizen Valerius Asiaticus became the first Gallic man to be elected as Roman consul. Vienna was also made into the capital of the Allobrogian civitas, and became one of the most powerful cities of Gaul during the first century AD. In the second half of the 3rd century, the city declined and shrank to its original urban core, although it remained an important settlement during the 4th century, serving as the occasional residence of the emperors Julian and Valentinian II.

==== Other settlements ====
Genaua (&#x27;[river] mouth&#x27;; modern Genève) was an oppidum erected on the hill of Saint-Pierre next to the Rhône, the Arve and the Lake Geneva, which allowed them to control the inland navigation on the Rhône. Located near the border of the Helvetii territory, Genaua was occupied from 130 BC at the latest.

Another important Allobrogian settlement was located in Cularo (&#x27;field of squash&#x27;, modern Grenoble), first mentioned by Munatius Plancus in 43 BC and later renamed to Gratianopolis.

Other oppida have been excavated at Musièges, Larina (Hières-sur-Amby), Saint-Saturnin (Chambéry), Les Étroits (Saint-Lattier), Quatre-Têtes (Saint-Just-de-Claix), and Rochefort (Varces).

==History==
=== Pre-Roman period ===
==== Origin ====
The Allobroges probably settled relatively late in Southern Gaul, for they are not attested before the late 3rd century BC, in connection with Hannibal&#x27;s crossing of the Alps in 218 BC. According to some scholars, they may be identified with the Gaesatae, a group of mercenary warriors first mentioned a few years earlier in the region and who fought against the Roman Republic in the Battle of Telamon (225 BC). The Allobroges may thus be the descendants of mobile groups of Gallic mercenaries who were active across central Europe in the first part of the 3rd century BC, and who eventually settled between the Rhône and the Alps in search for new opportunities during the later decades of the century.

==== Hannibal&#x27;s crossing of the Alps (218 BC) ====

In the mid-2nd century BC, the Greek historian Polybius first mentioned the Allobroges in his account of Hannibal&#x27;s crossing of the Alps in 218 BC. The Allobroges of the plain helped the Carthaginian conqueror, whereas those of the mountains tried in vain to block his passage.
Hannibal then expelled the other chieftain and was given new weapons, corn, warm clothing and footwear by his local ally. The latter protected him in the rear with him own forces through the territory of the Allobroges, until he reached the foot of the Alpine pass.

In Livy&#x27;s version, the Gallic chieftain who provided assistance to Hannibal is named Brancus (&#x27;the claw&#x27;, &quot;Braneus&quot;). According to some scholars, since the &#x27;Island&#x27; mentioned by ancient authors corresponds to the territory of the Segovellauni, Brancus may actually be Segovellaunian. In his account, however, Livy specifically states that the two chieftains were Allobroges.

From the 2nd century BC onward, a climate change known as the Roman Warm Period led to a reduction in migrations from Central and Northern Europe. As a result, the adoption rate of a sedentary lifestyle among the former roving tribes of the region, including the Allobroges, probably increased during the late 2nd and 1st century BC. Greek geographer Strabo later wrote in the early 1st century AD, &quot;formerly the Allobroges kept up warfare with many myriads of men, whereas now they till the plains and the glens that are in the Alps.&quot;

=== Early Roman period ===
==== Annexion to the Roman Republic (121 BC) ====
Between 125 and 122 BC, the Romans crossed the Alps and fought the Salluvii and Vocontii. During the conflict, the Allobroges gave shelter to the Salluvian leaders, including their king Toutomotoulos, and refused to hand them over, which, added to the fact that the Allobroges had raided the Aedui, a recent ally of Rome, led the latter to declare war against them.

They were defeated by the Romans forces of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus at the Battle of Vindalium in 121 BC, which occurred in modern Mourre-de-Sève (Sorgues), at the confluence of the Rhône and Sorgue rivers in Cavarian territory. The Allobrogian cavalry reportedly feared the Roman war elephants, and Orosius writes that they lost 20,000 men while 3,000 of them were captured. In August of the same year, the Roman army, strengthened by the troops of Quintus Fabius Maximus, inflicted a decisive defeat on a massive combined force of Allobroges, Arveni and the remaining Salluvii at the Battle of the Isère River. The Allobrogian territory was subsequently annexed to Rome by Domitius Ahenobarbus and Fabius Maximus, the latter earning the cognomen &quot;Allobrogicus&quot; for this feat.

Between 120 and 117, those new Roman lands were progressively pacified and incorporated into a Roman province known as Gallia Transalpina by Domitius Ahenobarbus. The Allobroges had to pay heavy taxes to Rome, although they were allowed to keep their administrative autonomy and territory. They likely suffered from the invasions of the Cimbri and Teutoni during the Cimbrian War in 107–102 BC. The Allobrogian territory – Vienna in particular as it was located in the middle of the Rhône Valley – represented the northern frontier that separated Rome from the &#x27;barbarian&#x27; world, and was thus exposed to the attacks of potentially hostile Gallic and Germanic tribes.

==== Legal protests (69–63 BC) ====
In 69 BC, the Allobroges sent a delegation to Rome led by their chief Indutiomarus in order to protest against the heavy taxes imposed by Marcus Fonteius, the Roman governor of Gallia Transalpina. Already in 104 BC, the tribune Domitius Ahenobarbus, son of the Roman conqueror of the Allobroges, had accused Silanus of injustice (&quot;iniurias&quot;) against the Allobrogian chief Aegritomarus. Fonteius chose Cicero as his lawyer, and although the verdict of the trial remains unknown, the Roman governor was probably acquitted. The Allobroges appear to have been the dominant tribe of Gallia Transalpina at that time, for Indutiomarus is presented as the &quot;leader of the Allobroges and all the Gauls&quot; by Cicero. According to scholar A. L. F. Rivet, they were probably feared as &quot;the one tribe in Gaul that really could mount war against the Roman people&quot;.

Later on, an Allobrogian insurrection was suppressed by Calpurnius Piso, who administered Gallia Narbonensis as proconsul until 65 BC. For this, he was unsuccessfully prosecuted by Caesar, who had interest in the region. In 63 BC, while Cicero was serving as consul, they sent another delegation to Rome, hoping to seek relief from the oppression and rapacity of the governor Lucius Murena and Roman businessmen active in the region. Their demands rejected by the Roman Senate, they were approached by supporters of Catiline, a senator who attempted to overthrow the Roman Republic and, in particular, the power of the aristocratic Senate. Seeing an opportunity to enlist their help to the Catiline conspiracy, Lentulus sent the businessman Umbrenus persuade the Gallic envoys to invade Italy in support of Catiline. Although initially favourable to this overture, the Allobroges thought that their fate would be better if they take the Senate&#x27;s side. They contacted their patron Q. Fabius Sanga, and Cicero convinced them to provide him with more evidence by feigning to join the conspirators. The supporters of Catiline then revealed all their plan to the Gauls, who demanded sealed letters from some leading conspirators, which the Allobroges eventually leaked to Cicero.

==== Revolt against Rome (62–61 BC) ====
Faced with a series of legal defeats, the Allobroges decided to take the arms against Rome in 62 BC. Led by their chief Catugnatus, they managed to resist against the Roman armies during nearly two years. The new governor of the province, Gaius Pomptinus, sent his legate Manlius Lentinus to crush the revolt.In 61 BC, a battle was fought between the Gallic and Roman troops near the Segovellaunian settlement of Ventia, which was eventually taken by Lentinus. At the same time, the two other legates seized and partly destroyed the Allobrogian chief town, Solonion. The coming of Catugnatus&#x27; forces momentary saved the stronghold, but further Roman troops led by Pomptinus surrounded and defeated the Gallic armies, putting an end to the rebellion. Their capital destroyed, the Allobrogian chieftains decided to move their place of residence to Vienna.

==== Political turmoils (58–44 BC) ====
The period saw the invasion of the remaining of Gaul by Julius Caesar, followed by a civil war and Caesar&#x27;s assassination in March 44. Although the Helvetii thought that they could persuade the Allobroges to let them go through their territory in 58 BC because of their antipathy to Rome, the Gallic tribe, presumably led at that time by Adbucillus, remained loyal to Caesar during all the Gallic Wars (58–50 BC). The Roman general used Vienna in particular as a strategic outpost during the conflict against the Gauls.

After the failed migration of the Helvetii, who were repelled by the Romans towards their homeland, the Allobroges were asked by Caesar to provide them with wheat. In the autumn of 57, the legate Galba spent winter in the Allobrogian territory after an unsuccessful campaign in Vallis Poenina (modern Valais). Following the Roman defeat at the Battle of Gergovia (52 BC), the Allobroges began to strengthen the border along the Rhône river, possibly fearing attacks coming from the other bank. Vercingetorix tried to bribe their leaders to fight on the side of the Gallic coalition against Caesar, but the Allobroges rejected the offer.

Two sons of Adbucillus, Aegus and Roscillus, provided assistance to Caesar in all of his Gallic campaigns. He assigned to them the highest magistracies among their own people, and granted them both money and conquered territory in Gaul. Regrettably, Caesar records that these privileges caused the two brothers to become &quot;carried away by a foolish native pride&quot; and to &quot;treat their men with contempt, cheating the cavalry of its pay and diverting all of the booty to themselves&quot;. Their own armies came to Caesar to complain, and the two brothers eventually defected to Pompey at Dyrrachium just before the Battle of Pharsalia (48 BC).

=== Roman Empire ===
Strabo reported in the early 1st century AD that all of the Allobroges lived in villages, &quot;except that the most notable of them, inhabitants of Vienna (formerly a village, but called, nevertheless, the &#x27;metropolis&#x27; of the tribe), have built it up into a city.&quot;

At the time of the late Roman Empire, the Allobrogian territory was divided and administered from the three main cities: Vienna, Geneva and Cularo (later renamed Gratianopolis).

==Religion==
From the &quot;Palace of Mirrors&quot; baths at Saint-Romain-en-Gal comes a statue of Vienna&#x27;s tutelary goddess. Aix-les-Bains was a major centre of the cult of the healing god Borvo.

The cult of Cybele was introduced to Vienna by traders from the Ancient Orient. A prominent temple likely dedicated to the goddess was built in the early 1st century AD, and a sacred theatre of Mysteries is dated to the 1st century AD. Outside of Vienna, however, evidence of the cult of Cybele, although not totally absent, are scattered and become rare when approaching the Alps.

== Political organization ==
Allobrogia was geographically divided between the plains of the Dauphiné and the mountains of Savoy, which influenced the political organization of the region, as documented by Polybius for the time of Hannibal&#x27;s Crossing of the Alps in 218 BC. Although this is not mentioned by the written sources, the Allobroges probably federated smaller peoples or ethnic unities of the area, as did the neighbouring Cavares and Vocontii. Polybius indeed writes that the plains of Allobrogia were ruled by &quot;various chiefs&quot;, suggesting the existence of a decentralized system of governance. Aimé Bocquet has proposed to identify those hypothetical tribal territories with five natural sub-regions: Chablais and , the Genevois, Savoie, Grésivaudan, and .

== Economy ==
During the Roman period, the Allobroges cultivated wheat and exported wine. Copper and silver deposits were numerous in the Western Alps.

== Legacy ==
===Légion des Allobroges===
The First French Republic, in line with its common practice of reviving names and concepts from Roman times, gave the name &quot;Légion des Allobroges&quot; to a unit of the French Revolutionary Army that consisted mainly of volunteers from Switzerland, Piedmont and Savoy - very roughly corresponding to what had been the lands of the Allobroges.

<text>Johann Jacob Dillen Dillenius (1684 – 2 April 1747) was a German botanist. He is known for his Hortus Elthamensis (&quot;Eltham Garden&quot;) on the rare plants around Eltham, London, and for his Historia muscorum (&quot;History of Mosses&quot;), a natural history of lower plants including mosses, liverworts, hornworts, lycopods, algae, lichens and fungi.

== Biography ==

Dillenius was born at Darmstadt and was educated at the University of Giessen, earlier the family name had been changed from Dillen to Dillenius. In 1721, at the instance of the botanist William Sherard (1659–1728), he moved to England. In 1734 Dillenius was appointed Sherardian professor of botany at Oxford, in accordance with the will of Sherard, who at his death in 1728 left the university £3000 for the endowment of the chair, as well as his library and herbarium, all on the condition that Dillenius should be appointed the first professor.

Dillenius died at Oxford, of apoplexy. His manuscripts, books and collections of dried plants, with many drawings, were bought by his successor at Oxford, Dr. Humphry Sibthorp (1713–1797), and ultimately passed into the possession of Oxford University. For an account of his collections preserved at Oxford, see &quot;The Dillenian Herbaria&quot;, by G. Claridge Druce (Oxford, 1907).

== Work ==

At Giessen Dillenius wrote botanical papers for the &quot;Ephemerides naturae curiosorum&quot;. He printed, in 1719, his &quot;flora&quot; of the university&#x27;s surroundings, a &quot;Catalogus plantarum sponte circa Gissam nascentium&quot;, illustrated with figures he had personally drawn and engraved, with descriptions of several new species.

In 1724 Dillenius published the third edition of John Ray&#x27;s &quot;Synopsis Methodica Stirpium Britannicarum&quot;. It incorporated plant species discovered by Samuel Brewer, and work on mosses by Adam Buddle. It remained a standard reference for British botanists until the appearance of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1761.

=== &quot;Hortus Elthamensis&quot; ===

In 1732 he published &quot;Hortus Elthamensis&quot;, a substantial catalogue in two volumes of some 400 plants growing at Eltham, London, in the collection of Sherard&#x27;s younger brother, James (1666—1738), who, after making a fortune as an apothecary, devoted himself to gardening and music. For this work Dillenius himself drew and engraved 324 plates, containing 417 figures of the plants. The title called the plants &quot;rare&quot;, but the botanist Will Tjaden comments that they were &quot;often only uncommon and not always of very recent introduction.&quot; The book was described by Linnaeus, who spent a month with him at Oxford in 1736, and afterwards dedicated his &quot;Critica Botanica&quot; to him, as &quot;opus botanicum quo absolutius mundus non vidit&quot;, &quot;a botanical work of which the world has not seen one more authoritative&quot;. Linnaeus later named a genus of tropical tree &quot;Dillenia&quot; in his honour.

=== &quot;Historia muscorum&quot; ===

Dillenius wrote &quot;Historia muscorum&quot; (1741), a natural history of lower plants including mosses, liverworts, hornworts, lycopods, algae, lichens and fungi. He acknowledged the help of George Charles Deering. They had met at John Martyn&#x27;s club for botanists, and had studied fungi together.

== Honours ==

In 1753, Carl Linnaeus in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; published &quot;Dillenia&quot;, a genus of flowering plants in the family Dilleniaceae, native to tropical and subtropical regions of southern Asia, Australasia, and the Indian Ocean islands, both genus and family named in Dillenius&#x27;s honour.

In 1997, the Spanish botanist Gerardo Antonio Aymard Corredor published &quot;Neodillenia&quot;, a genus of flowering plants from South America belonging to the family Dilleniaceae, named in Dillenius&#x27;s honour.

<text>The forecastle ( ; contracted as fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle or fo&#x27;c&#x27;s&#x27;le) is the upper deck of a sailing ship forward of the foremast, or, historically, the forward part of a ship with the sailors&#x27; living quarters. Related to the latter meaning is the phrase &quot;&quot; which denotes anything related to ordinary sailors, as opposed to a ship&#x27;s officers.

==History and design==
In medieval shipbuilding, a ship of war was usually equipped with a tall, multi-deck castle-like structure in the bow of the ship. It served as a platform for archers to shoot down on enemy ships, or as a defensive stronghold if the ship were boarded. A similar but usually much larger structure, called the aftcastle, was at the aft end of the ship, often stretching all the way from the main mast to the stern.

Having such tall upper works on the ship was detrimental to sailing performance. As cannons were introduced and gunfire replaced boarding as the primary means of naval combat during the 16th century, the medieval forecastle was no longer needed, and later ships such as the galleon had only a low, one-deck-high forecastle. Sailors stationed on the forecastle, or &quot;forecastle men&quot;, were responsible for handling the headsails and the anchors. In the Royal Navy of the 17th and 18th centuries, these roles were reserved for older seamen who lacked the agility to go aloft or take other more strenuous duties aboard.

By the end of the 19th century, a raised forecastle had become a typical feature on warships again, in an attempt to keep forward gun positions from getting unacceptably wet on heavy seas. In addition the forecastle may provide additional crew&#x27;s quarters as in the past, and may contain essential machinery such as the anchor windlass. A disadvantage of such a design is the structural weakness at the forecastle &#x27;break&#x27; (the rear end of the forecastle with the main deck behind and below) relative to a flush deck structure.

Some sailing ships and many modern non-sail ships have no forecastle as such at all, but the name is still used to indicate the foremost part of the upper deck – although often called the &quot;foredeck&quot; – and for any crew&#x27;s quarters in the bow of the ship, even if below the main deck.

<text>A disinfectant is a chemical substance or compound used to inactivate or destroy microorganisms on inert surfaces. Disinfection does not necessarily kill all microorganisms, especially resistant bacterial spores; it is less effective than sterilization, which is an extreme physical or chemical process that kills all types of life. Disinfectants are generally distinguished from other antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics, which destroy microorganisms within the body, and antiseptics, which destroy microorganisms on living tissue. Disinfectants are also different from biocides—the latter are intended to destroy all forms of life, not just microorganisms.
Disinfectants work by destroying the cell wall of microbes or interfering with their metabolism. It is also a form of decontamination, and can be defined as the process whereby physical or chemical methods are used to reduce the amount of pathogenic microorganisms on a surface.

Disinfectants can also be used to destroy microorganisms on the skin and mucous membrane, as in the medical dictionary historically the word simply meant that it destroys microbes.

Sanitizers are substances that simultaneously clean and disinfect. Disinfectants kill more germs than sanitizers. Disinfectants are frequently used in hospitals, dental surgeries, kitchens, and bathrooms to kill infectious organisms. Sanitizers are mild compared to disinfectants and are used majorly to clean things that are in human contact whereas disinfectants are concentrated and are used to clean surfaces like floors and building premises.

Bacterial endospores are most resistant to disinfectants, but some fungi, viruses and bacteria also possess some resistance.

In wastewater treatment, a disinfection step with chlorine, ultra-violet (UV) radiation or ozonation can be included as tertiary treatment to remove pathogens from wastewater, for example if it is to be discharged to a river or the sea where there body contact immersion recreations is practiced (Europe) or reused to irrigate golf courses (US). An alternative term used in the sanitation sector for disinfection of waste streams, sewage sludge or fecal sludge is sanitisation or sanitization.

==Definitions==
The Australian Therapeutic Goods Order No. 54 defines several grades of disinfectant as will be used below.

===Sterilant===
Sterilant means a chemical agent which is used to sterilize critical medical devices or medical instruments. A sterilant kills all micro-organisms with the result that the sterility assurance level of a microbial survivor is less than 10^-6. Sterilant gases are not within this scope.

===Low level disinfectant===
Low level disinfectant means a disinfectant that rapidly kills most vegetative bacteria as well as medium-sized lipid containing viruses, when used according to labelling. It cannot be relied upon to destroy, within a practical period, bacterial endospores, mycobacteria, fungi, or all small nonlipid viruses.

===Intermediate level disinfectant===
Intermediate level disinfectant means a disinfectant that kills all microbial pathogens except bacterial endospores, when used as recommended by the manufacturer. It is bactericidal, tuberculocidal, fungicidal (against asexual spores but not necessarily dried chlamydospores or sexual spores), and virucidal.

===High level disinfectant===
High level disinfectant means a disinfectant that kills all microbial pathogens, except large numbers of bacterial endospores when used as recommended by its manufacturer.

===Instrument grade===
Instrument grade disinfectant means:
# a disinfectant which is used to reprocess reusable therapeutic devices; and
# when associated with the words &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot; or &quot;high&quot; means &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot; or &quot;high&quot; level disinfectant respectively.

===Hospital grade===
Hospital grade means a disinfectant that is suitable for general purpose disinfection of building and fitting surfaces, and purposes not involving instruments or surfaces likely to come into contact with broken skin:
# in premises used for:
#* the investigation or treatment of a disease, ailment or injury; or
#* procedures that are carried out involving the penetration of the human skin; or,
# in connection with:
#* the business of beauty therapy or hairdressing; or
#* the practice of podiatry;

but does not include :
# Instrument grade disinfectants; or
# sterilant; or
# an antibacterial clothes preparation; or
# a sanitary fluid; or
# a sanitary powder; or
# a sanitiser.

===Household/commercial grade===
Household/commercial grade disinfectant means a disinfectant that is suitable for general purpose disinfection of building or fitting surfaces, and for other purposes, in premises or involving procedures other than those specified for a hospital-grade disinfectant, but is not:
# an antibacterial clothes preparation; or
# a sanitary fluid; or
# a sanitary powder; or
# a sanitiser

==Measurements of effectiveness==
One way to compare disinfectants is to compare how well they do against a known disinfectant and rate them accordingly. Phenol is the standard, and the corresponding rating system is called the &quot;Phenol coefficient&quot;. The disinfectant to be tested is compared with phenol on a standard microbe (usually &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot; or &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;). Disinfectants that are more effective than phenol have a coefficient &gt; 1. Those that are less effective have a coefficient &lt; 1.

The standard European approach for disinfectant validation consists of a basic suspension test, a quantitative suspension test (with low and high levels of organic material added to act as &#x27;interfering substances&#x27;) and a two part simulated-use surface test.

A less specific measurement of effectiveness is the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classification into either &quot;high&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot; or &quot;low&quot; levels of disinfection. &quot;High-level disinfection kills all organisms, except high levels of bacterial spores&quot; and is done with a chemical germicide marketed as a sterilant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). &quot;Intermediate-level disinfection kills mycobacteria, most viruses, and bacteria with a chemical germicide registered as a &#x27;tuberculocide&#x27; by the Environmental Protection Agency. Low-level disinfection kills some viruses and bacteria with a chemical germicide registered as a hospital disinfectant by the EPA.&quot;

An alternative assessment is to measure the Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of disinfectants against selected (and representative) microbial species, such as through the use of microbroth dilution testing. However, those methods are obtained at standard inoculum levels without considering the inoculum effect. More informative methods are nowadays in demand to determine the minimum disinfectant dose as a function of the density of the target microbial species.

==Properties==
A perfect disinfectant would also offer complete and full microbiological sterilisation, without harming humans and useful form of life, be inexpensive, and noncorrosive. However, most disinfectants are also, by nature, potentially harmful (even toxic) to humans or animals. Most modern household disinfectants contain denatonium, an exceptionally bitter substance added to discourage ingestion, as a safety measure. Those that are used indoors should never be mixed with other cleaning products as chemical reactions can occur. The choice of disinfectant to be used depends on the particular situation. Some disinfectants have a wide spectrum (kill many different types of microorganisms), while others kill a smaller range of disease-causing organisms but are preferred for other properties (they may be non-corrosive, non-toxic, or inexpensive).

There are arguments for creating or maintaining conditions that are not conducive to bacterial survival and multiplication, rather than attempting to kill them with chemicals. Bacteria can increase in number very quickly, which enables them to evolve rapidly. Should some bacteria survive a chemical attack, they give rise to new generations composed completely of bacteria that have resistance to the particular chemical used. Under a sustained chemical attack, the surviving bacteria in successive generations are increasingly resistant to the chemical used, and ultimately the chemical is rendered ineffective. For this reason, some question the wisdom of impregnating cloths, cutting boards and worktops in the home with bactericidal chemicals.

==Types==

===Air disinfectants===

Air disinfectants are typically chemical substances capable of disinfecting microorganisms suspended in the air. Disinfectants are generally assumed to be limited to use on surfaces, but that is not the case. In 1928, a study found that airborne microorganisms could be killed using mists of dilute bleach. An air disinfectant must be dispersed either as an aerosol or vapour at a sufficient concentration in the air to cause the number of viable infectious microorganisms to be significantly reduced.

In the 1940s and early 1950s, further studies showed inactivation of diverse bacteria, influenza virus, and &quot;Penicillium chrysogenum&quot; (previously &quot;P. notatum&quot;) mold fungus using various glycols, principally propylene glycol and triethylene glycol. In principle, these chemical substances are ideal air disinfectants because they have both high lethality to microorganisms and low mammalian toxicity.

Although glycols are effective air disinfectants in controlled laboratory environments, it is more difficult to use them effectively in real-world environments because the disinfection of air is sensitive to continuous action. Continuous action in real-world environments with outside air exchanges at door, HVAC, and window interfaces, and in the presence of materials that absorb and remove glycols from the air, poses engineering challenges that are not critical for surface disinfection. The engineering challenge associated with creating a sufficient concentration of the glycol vapours in the air have not to date been sufficiently addressed.

===Alcohols===
Alcohol and alcohol plus Quaternary ammonium cation based compounds comprise a class of proven surface sanitizers and disinfectants approved by the EPA and the Centers for Disease Control for use as a hospital grade disinfectant. Alcohols are most effective when combined with distilled water to facilitate diffusion through the cell membrane; 100% alcohol typically denatures only external membrane proteins. A mixture of 70% ethanol or isopropanol diluted in water is effective against a wide spectrum of bacteria, though higher concentrations are often needed to disinfect wet surfaces. Additionally, high-concentration mixtures (such as 80% ethanol + 5% isopropanol) are required to effectively inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses (such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C).

The efficacy of alcohol is enhanced when in solution with the wetting agent dodecanoic acid (coconut soap). The synergistic effect of 29.4% ethanol with dodecanoic acid is effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Further testing is being performed against Clostridioides difficile (C.Diff) spores with higher concentrations of ethanol and dodecanoic acid, which proved effective with a contact time of ten minutes.

===Aldehydes===
Aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, have a wide microbicidal activity and are sporicidal and fungicidal. They are partly inactivated by organic matter and have slight residual activity.

Some bacteria have developed resistance to glutaraldehyde, and it has been found that glutaraldehyde can cause asthma and other health hazards, hence ortho-phthalaldehyde is replacing glutaraldehyde.

===Oxidizing agents===

Oxidizing agents act by oxidizing the cell membrane of microorganisms, which results in a loss of structure and leads to cell lysis and death. A large number of disinfectants operate in this way. Chlorine and oxygen are strong oxidizers, so their compounds figure heavily here.
* Electrolyzed water or &quot;Anolyte&quot; is an oxidizing, acidic hypochlorite solution made by electrolysis of sodium chloride into sodium hypochlorite and hypochlorous acid. Anolyte has an oxidation-reduction potential of +600 to +1200 mV and a typical pH range of 3.5––8.5, but the most potent solution is produced at a controlled pH 5.0–6.3 where the predominant oxychlorine species is hypochlorous acid.
* Hydrogen peroxide is used in hospitals to disinfect surfaces and it is used in solution alone or in combination with other chemicals as a high level disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide is sometimes mixed with colloidal silver. It is often preferred because it causes far fewer allergic reactions than alternative disinfectants. Also used in the food packaging industry to disinfect foil containers. A 3% solution is also used as an antiseptic.
* Hydrogen peroxide vapor is used as a medical sterilant and as room disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide has the advantage that it decomposes to form oxygen and water thus leaving no long term residues, but hydrogen peroxide as with most other strong oxidants is hazardous, and solutions are a primary irritant. The vapor is hazardous to the respiratory system and eyes and consequently the OSHA permissible exposure limit is 1 ppm (29 CFR 1910.1000 Table Z-1) calculated as an eight-hour time weighted average and the NIOSH immediately dangerous to life and health limit is 75 ppm. Therefore, engineering controls, personal protective equipment, gas monitoring etc. should be employed where high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are used in the workplace. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide is one of the chemicals approved for decontamination of anthrax spores from contaminated buildings, such as occurred during the 2001 anthrax attacks in the U.S. It has also been shown to be effective in removing exotic animal viruses, such as avian influenza and Newcastle disease from equipment and surfaces.
* The antimicrobial action of hydrogen peroxide can be enhanced by surfactants and organic acids. The resulting chemistry is known as Accelerated hydrogen peroxide. A 2% solution, stabilized for extended use, achieves high-level disinfection in 5 minutes, and is suitable for disinfecting medical equipment made from hard plastic, such as in endoscopes. The evidence available suggests that products based on Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide, apart from being good germicides, are safer for humans and benign to the environment.
* Ozone is a gas used for disinfecting water, laundry, foods, air, and surfaces. It is chemically aggressive and destroys many organic compounds, resulting in rapid decolorization and deodorization in addition to disinfection. Ozone decomposes relatively quickly. However, due to this characteristic of ozone, tap water chlorination cannot be entirely replaced by ozonation, as the ozone would decompose already in the water piping. Instead, it is used to remove the bulk of oxidizable matter from the water, which would produce small amounts of organochlorides if treated with chlorine only. Regardless, ozone has a very wide range of applications from municipal to industrial water treatment due to its powerful reactivity.
* Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is a purplish-black crystalline powder that colours everything it touches, through a strong oxidising action. This includes staining &quot;stainless&quot; steel, which somewhat limits its use and makes it necessary to use plastic or glass containers. It is used to disinfect aquariums and is used in some community swimming pools as a foot disinfectant before entering the pool. Typically, a large shallow basin of KMnO4 / water solution is kept near the pool ladder. Participants are required to step in the basin and then go into the pool. Additionally, it is widely used to disinfect community water ponds and wells in tropical countries, as well as to disinfect the mouth before pulling out teeth. It can be applied to wounds in dilute solution.

=== Peroxy and peroxo acids ===
Peroxycarboxylic acids and inorganic peroxo acids are strong oxidants and extremely effective disinfectants.
* Peroxyformic acid
* Peracetic acid
* Peroxypropionic acid
* Monoperoxyglutaric acid
* Monoperoxysuccinic acid
* Peroxybenzoic acid
* Peroxyanisic acid
* Chloroperbenzoic acid
* Monoperoxyphthalic acid
* Peroxymonosulfuric acid

===Phenolics===
Phenolics are active ingredients in some household disinfectants. They are also found in some mouthwashes and in disinfectant soap and handwashes. Phenols are toxic to cats and newborn humans
* Phenol is probably the oldest known disinfectant as it was first used by Lister, when it was called carbolic acid. It is rather corrosive to the skin and sometimes toxic to sensitive people. Impure preparations of phenol were originally made from coal tar, and these contained low concentrations of other aromatic hydrocarbons including benzene, which is an IARC Group 1 carcinogen.
* &quot;o&quot;-Phenylphenol is often used instead of phenol, since it is somewhat less corrosive.
* Chloroxylenol is the principal ingredient in Dettol, a household disinfectant and antiseptic.
* Hexachlorophene is a phenolic that was once used as a germicidal additive to some household products but was banned due to suspected harmful effects.
* Thymol, derived from the herb thyme, is the active ingredient in some &quot;broad spectrum&quot; disinfectants that often bear ecological claims. It is used as a stabilizer in pharmaceutic preparations. It has been used for its antiseptic, antibacterial, and antifungal actions, and was formerly used as a vermifuge.
* Amylmetacresol is found in Strepsils, a throat disinfectant.
* Although not a phenol, 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has similar effects as phenols, but it cannot inactivate viruses.

===Quaternary ammonium compounds===

Quaternary ammonium compounds (&quot;quats&quot;), such as benzalkonium chloride, are a large group of related compounds. Some concentrated formulations have been shown to be effective low-level disinfectants. Quaternary ammonia at or above 200ppm plus alcohol solutions exhibit efficacy against difficult to kill non-enveloped viruses such as norovirus, rotavirus, or polio virus. Newer synergous, low-alcohol formulations are highly effective broad-spectrum disinfectants with quick contact times (3–5 minutes) against bacteria, enveloped viruses, pathogenic fungi, and mycobacteria. Quats are biocides that also kill algae and are used as an additive in large-scale industrial water systems to minimize undesired biological growth.

=== Inorganic compounds ===
==== Chlorine ====
This group comprises aqueous solution of chlorine, hypochlorite, or hypochlorous acid. Occasionally, chlorine-releasing compounds and their salts are included in this group. Frequently, a concentration of &lt; 1 ppm of available chlorine is sufficient to kill bacteria and viruses, spores and mycobacteria requiring higher concentrations.
Chlorine has been used for applications, such as the deactivation of pathogens in drinking water, swimming pool water and wastewater, for the disinfection of household areas and for textile bleaching
* Sodium hypochlorite
* Calcium hypochlorite
* Monochloramine
* Chloramine-T
* Trichloroisocyanuric acid
* Chlorine dioxide
* Hypochlorous acid

==== Iodine ====
* Iodine
* Iodophors

==== Acids and bases ====
* Sodium hydroxide
* Potassium hydroxide
* Calcium hydroxide
* Magnesium hydroxide
* Sulfurous acid
* Sulfur dioxide
* phosphoric acid
* dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid

====Metals====
Most metals, especially those with high atomic weights can inhibit the growth of pathogens by disrupting their metabolism.

=== Terpenes ===
* Thymol
* Pine oil

===Other===
The biguanide polymer polyaminopropyl biguanide is specifically bactericidal at very low concentrations (10 mg/L). It has a unique method of action: The polymer strands are incorporated into the bacterial cell wall, which disrupts the membrane and reduces its permeability, which has a lethal effect to bacteria. It is also known to bind to bacterial DNA, alter its transcription, and cause lethal DNA damage. It has very low toxicity to higher organisms such as human cells, which have more complex and protective membranes.

Common sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) has antifungal properties, and some antiviral and antibacterial properties, though those are too weak to be effective at a home environment.

===Non-chemical===
Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation is the use of high-intensity shortwave ultraviolet light for disinfecting smooth surfaces such as dental tools, but not porous materials that are opaque to the light such as wood or foam. Ultraviolet light is also used for municipal water treatment. Ultraviolet light fixtures are often present in microbiology labs, and are activated only when there are no occupants in a room (e.g., at night).

Heat treatment can be used for disinfection and sterilization.

The phrase &quot;sunlight is the best disinfectant&quot; was popularized in 1913 by United States Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis and later advocates of government transparency. While sunlight&#x27;s ultraviolet rays can act as a disinfectant, the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer blocks the rays&#x27; most effective wavelengths. Ultraviolet light-emitting machines, such as those used to disinfect some hospital rooms, make for better disinfectants than sunlight.

Since the mid-1990s cold plasma has been shown to be an efficient sterilization/disinfection agent. Cold plasma is an ionized gas that remains at room temperature. It generates reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species that interact with bacterial wall and membrane and cause oxidation of the lipids and proteins and can also lyse the cells. Cold plasma can inactivate bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

==Electrostatic disinfection==

There has been a rise in the use of electrostatic disinfectants in recent years. Electrostatic disinfection is a process achieved by use of electrostatic sprayers notable examples of which include the Vycel -Vycel 4 or the Techtronics Ryobi. Electrostatic Sprayers are a new technology for disinfecting surfaces. Unlike conventional spraying bottles or devices electrostatic sprayers apply a positive ionic charge to liquid disinfectants as they pass through the nozzle of the device. The positively charged disinfectant distributed through the nozzle of an electrostatic sprayer is attracted to negatively charged surfaces, which allows for efficient coating of disinfectant solutions on to hard nonporous surfaces. There are a number of specific disinfectants designed for use with electrostatic sprayers and these are often dissolved in solution or diluted with water. Notable disinfectant sprays that are designed for use with electrostatic sprayers include Citrox Disinfectant Solution and Vital Oxide Disinfectant Solution.

== Health and safety concerns ==

=== Production ===
Individuals who work manufacturing disinfectants have higher exposure to the raw and harsh chemicals used in the production of disinfectants compared to the general population. This is due to the use of manual labor and automated machinery. However, the use of automated machinery does not dismiss any direct contact with the chemicals within the production of disinfectants. Chemicals used in disinfectants vary in forms, such as gel, liquid, and powder. Minimal information remains about the health and safety of workers in other sectors of the production and manufacturing process of disinfectants. Inspection is a process of disinfectant manufacturing that only requires human intervention. Many workers in the inspection phase of mass production of disinfectants have reported accidental inhalation of fumes, direct dermal contact, eye irritation, and accidental ingestion of disinfectant substances. Studies have shown reports of workers with short-term neurological impairments, dermal hypersensitivity, skin irritation, chemical burns, dermatitis, occupational asthma and work-related asthma, mucus membrane (nasal) and lung irritation, and some types of cancer after direct and consistent contact with disinfectants. 

The chemicals, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), phenolic compounds, iodophors, glutaraldehyde, alcohols, and chlorine, were most associated with the previous health effects. This evidence of dermal exposure was associated with the misuse or lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Cancer has been shown to only develop in consistent exposure, along with the lack of use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Among these numerous health effects, evidence showed that dermal exposure was more hazardous than inhalation. These health effects can be minimized with the implementation of guidelines from the CDC, NPIC, OSHA, and NIOSH.

=== Healthcare Settings ===
There is evidence that exposure to cleaning and disinfectant products can cause acute health effects on healthcare workers. Observed effects include eye irritation and watery eyes, headaches, dizziness, throat irritation and wheezing, skin irritation, and work-related asthma. Most of these have a low severity. Some chemicals in cleaning and disinfectants that have been associated with health impacts include chlorine, ammonia,[2] ethanolamine, 2-butoxyethanol, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), and bleach. 

The adverse health impacts of disinfectants are still not well studied, which makes it difficult to develop guidelines for use in healthcare settings that take mind of potential effects. There is also little information about how effective and safe alternative cleaning technology, so-called “green cleaning,” is. New guidelines would need to maintain high hygiene standards and prevent healthcare-associated infections.

=== Professional Cleaning and Commercial Use ===
Professional and Industrial cleaners, despite being essential in maintaining hygiene and safety are one of the understudied occupational groups. Continuous exposure to cleaning agents containing ethanolamine, chloramine-T, and Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (QACs) was found to cause Occupational Asthma (OA) in cleaners. QAC was also found to be involved in developing antimicrobial resistance. Symptoms reported were dyspnea, cough, and wheezing. Females had more risk of acquiring OA due to higher exposures both at home and work. Exposures happen through dermal contact, hand-to-mouth, and inhalation of aerosolized quats. Researchers suggest continuous use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), periodic medical examinations, and guidelines on how to handle chemicals.

Dermal, respiratory, immune, reproductive, and developmental effects of exposure are investigated but there is a currently limited scope of this study. Other concerns found were its impact on wastewater management, soil, and food especially in dissolved concentrations. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate QACs depending on their intended purposes. Stricter regulations and policies are warranted for safer use and search for alternatives to limit exposures.

<text>Maryam Mursal (, ) (born 1 January 1950) is a Somali composer and vocalist. 

==Biography==
Mursal grew up in Somalia in a Muslim family with four daughters. Mursal&#x27;s family was originally from Galmudug Somalia, and is from the Madhibaan clan.

As a teenager, she broke with tradition and began singing professionally in Mogadishu. She performed in nightclubs and her brand of music, featuring a mix of blues, soul, Somali and Arabic influences, known as &quot;Somali jazz&quot;, became popular across the country. Performing primarily solo, she also collaborated with Waaberi, a 300-member music and dance troupe associated with the Somali National Theatre. Later, after having criticized Somalia&#x27;s then ruling military government, she was banned from singing for two years, and made her living driving a taxi.

During the subsequent civil war in her homeland, Mursal and her five children moved to neighboring Djibouti, where she found asylum in the Danish embassy. It was this odyssey that provided the gem of her solo recording &quot;The Journey&quot;, with guitars, sequencers and back-up vocals from Peter Gabriel.

Mursal still lives abroad, now residing in UK. She has toured Europe with Waaberi and appeared with Nina Simone. Her work has been produced by Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World record label.

* &quot;The Journey&quot;
* &quot;Indho caashaq (love eyes)

==Quotes==
*&quot;Traditional music is very important to me but I was also listening to people like Ray Charles, The Beatles, everything.&quot;
*&quot;We as artists are responsible if something wrong is taking place in our society. It&#x27;s very important for us to speak up, even though we may have to do it with a double tongue. We have to speak out for our people.&quot;
*&quot;I was always the first woman. I was the first woman singing Somali jazz, I was the first star, and I was the first to drive a taxi! I was the first to drive a lorry, and now I&#x27;m the first woman from Somalia to have an international record.&quot;

<text>A normal mode of a dynamical system is a pattern of motion in which all parts of the system move sinusoidally with the same frequency and with a fixed phase relation. The free motion described by the normal modes takes place at fixed frequencies. These fixed frequencies of the normal modes of a system are known as its natural frequencies or resonant frequencies. A physical object, such as a building, bridge, or molecule, has a set of normal modes and their natural frequencies that depend on its structure, materials and boundary conditions. 

The most general motion of a linear system is a superposition of its normal modes. The modes are normal in the sense that they can move independently, that is to say that an excitation of one mode will never cause motion of a different mode. In mathematical terms, normal modes are orthogonal to each other.

== General definitions ==

=== Mode ===
In the wave theory of physics and engineering, a mode in a dynamical system is a standing wave state of excitation, in which all the components of the system will be affected sinusoidally at a fixed frequency associated with that mode.

Because no real system can perfectly fit under the standing wave framework, the &quot;mode&quot; concept is taken as a general characterization of specific states of oscillation, thus treating the dynamic system in a &quot;linear&quot; fashion, in which linear superposition of states can be performed.

Typical examples include:
* In a mechanical dynamical system, a vibrating rope is the most clear example of a mode, in which the rope is the medium, the stress on the rope is the excitation, and the displacement of the rope with respect to its static state is the modal variable.
* In an acoustic dynamical system, a single sound pitch is a mode, in which the air is the medium, the sound pressure in the air is the excitation, and the displacement of the air molecules is the modal variable.
* In a structural dynamical system, a high tall building oscillating under its most flexural axis is a mode, in which all the material of the building -under the proper numerical simplifications- is the medium, the seismic/wind/environmental solicitations are the excitations and the displacements are the modal variable.
* In an electrical dynamical system, a resonant cavity made of thin metal walls, enclosing a hollow space, for a particle accelerator is a pure standing wave system, and thus an example of a mode, in which the hollow space of the cavity is the medium, the RF source (a Klystron or another RF source) is the excitation and the electromagnetic field is the modal variable.
* When relating to music, normal modes of vibrating instruments (strings, air pipes, drums, etc.) are called &quot;overtones&quot;.

The concept of normal modes also finds application in other dynamical systems, such as optics, quantum mechanics, atmospheric dynamics and molecular dynamics.

Most dynamical systems can be excited in several modes, possibly simultaneously. Each mode is characterized by one or several frequencies, according to the modal variable field. For example, a vibrating rope in 2D space is defined by a single-frequency (1D axial displacement), but a vibrating rope in 3D space is defined by two frequencies (2D axial displacement).

For a given amplitude on the modal variable, each mode will store a specific amount of energy because of the sinusoidal excitation.

The &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;dominant&quot; mode of a system with multiple modes will be the mode storing the minimum amount of energy for a given amplitude of the modal variable, or, equivalently, for a given stored amount of energy, the dominant mode will be the mode imposing the maximum amplitude of the modal variable.

===Mode numbers===
A mode of vibration is characterized by a modal frequency and a mode shape. It is numbered according to the number of half waves in the vibration. For example, if a vibrating beam with both ends pinned displayed a mode shape of half of a sine wave (one peak on the vibrating beam) it would be vibrating in mode 1. If it had a full sine wave (one peak and one trough) it would be vibrating in mode 2.

In a system with two or more dimensions, such as the pictured disk, each dimension is given a mode number. Using polar coordinates, we have a radial coordinate and an angular coordinate. If one measured from the center outward along the radial coordinate one would encounter a full wave, so the mode number in the radial direction is 2. The other direction is trickier, because only half of the disk is considered due to the anti-symmetric (also called skew-symmetry) nature of a disk&#x27;s vibration in the angular direction. Thus, measuring 180° along the angular direction you would encounter a half wave, so the mode number in the angular direction is 1. So the mode number of the system is 2–1 or 1–2, depending on which coordinate is considered the &quot;first&quot; and which is considered the &quot;second&quot; coordinate (so it is important to always indicate which mode number matches with each coordinate direction).

In linear systems each mode is entirely independent of all other modes. In general all modes have different frequencies (with lower modes having lower frequencies) and different mode shapes.

===Nodes===

In a one-dimensional system at a given mode the vibration will have nodes, or places where the displacement is always zero. These nodes correspond to points in the mode shape where the mode shape is zero. Since the vibration of a system is given by the mode shape multiplied by a time function, the displacement of the node points remain zero at all times.

When expanded to a two dimensional system, these nodes become lines where the displacement is always zero. If you watch the animation above you will see two circles (one about halfway between the edge and center, and the other on the edge itself) and a straight line bisecting the disk, where the displacement is close to zero. In an idealized system these lines equal zero exactly, as shown to the right.

==In mechanical systems==
In the analysis of conservative systems with small displacements from equilibrium, important in acoustics, molecular spectra, and electrical circuits, the system can be transformed to new coordinates called normal coordinates. Each normal coordinate corresponds to a single vibrational frequency of the system and the corresponding motion of the system is called the normal mode of vibration. 
=== Coupled oscillators ===
Consider two equal bodies (not affected by gravity), each of mass , attached to three springs, each with spring constant . They are attached in the following manner, forming a system that is physically symmetric:

where the edge points are fixed and cannot move. Let denote the horizontal displacement of the left mass, and denote the displacement of the right mass.

Denoting acceleration (the second derivative of with respect to time) as the equations of motion are:

formula_1

Since we expect oscillatory motion of a normal mode (where is the same for both masses), we try:

formula_2

Substituting these into the equations of motion gives us:

formula_3

Omitting the exponential factor (because it is common to all terms) and simplifying yields:

formula_4

And in matrix representation:

formula_5

If the matrix on the left is invertible, the unique solution is the trivial solution . The non trivial solutions are to be found for those values of whereby the matrix on the left is singular; i.e. is not invertible. It follows that the determinant of the matrix must be equal to 0, so:

formula_6

Solving for , the two positive solutions are:

formula_7

Substituting into the matrix and solving for , yields . Substituting results in . (These vectors are eigenvectors, and the frequencies are eigenvalues.)

The first normal mode is:
formula_8

Which corresponds to both masses moving in the same direction at the same time. This mode is called antisymmetric.

The second normal mode is:

formula_9

This corresponds to the masses moving in the opposite directions, while the center of mass remains stationary. This mode is called symmetric.

The general solution is a superposition of the normal modes where , , , and are determined by the initial conditions of the problem.

The process demonstrated here can be generalized and formulated using the formalism of Lagrangian mechanics or Hamiltonian mechanics.

=== Standing waves ===
A standing wave is a continuous form of normal mode. In a standing wave, all the space elements (i.e. coordinates) are oscillating in the same frequency and in phase (reaching the equilibrium point together), but each has a different amplitude.

The general form of a standing wave is:

formula_10

where represents the dependence of amplitude on location and the cosine/sine are the oscillations in time.

Physically, standing waves are formed by the interference (superposition) of waves and their reflections (although one may also say the opposite; that a moving wave is a superposition of standing waves). The geometric shape of the medium determines what would be the interference pattern, thus determines the form of the standing wave. This space-dependence is called a normal mode.

Usually, for problems with continuous dependence on there is no single or finite number of normal modes, but there are infinitely many normal modes. If the problem is bounded (i.e. it is defined on a finite section of space) there are countably many normal modes (usually numbered ). If the problem is not bounded, there is a continuous spectrum of normal modes.

=== Elastic solids ===
In any solid at any temperature, the primary particles (e.g. atoms or molecules) are not stationary, but rather vibrate about mean positions. In insulators the capacity of the solid to store thermal energy is due almost entirely to these vibrations. Many physical properties of the solid (e.g. modulus of elasticity) can be predicted given knowledge of the frequencies with which the particles vibrate. The simplest assumption (by Einstein) is that all the particles oscillate about their mean positions with the same natural frequency . This is equivalent to the assumption that all atoms vibrate independently with a frequency . Einstein also assumed that the allowed energy states of these oscillations are harmonics, or integral multiples of . The spectrum of waveforms can be described mathematically using a Fourier series of sinusoidal density fluctuations (or thermal phonons).

Debye subsequently recognized that each oscillator is intimately coupled to its neighboring oscillators at all times. Thus, by replacing Einstein&#x27;s identical uncoupled oscillators with the same number of coupled oscillators, Debye correlated the elastic vibrations of a one-dimensional solid with the number of mathematically special modes of vibration of a stretched string (see figure). The pure tone of lowest pitch or frequency is referred to as the fundamental and the multiples of that frequency are called its harmonic overtones. He assigned to one of the oscillators the frequency of the fundamental vibration of the whole block of solid. He assigned to the remaining oscillators the frequencies of the harmonics of that fundamental, with the highest of all these frequencies being limited by the motion of the smallest primary unit.

The normal modes of vibration of a crystal are in general superpositions of many overtones, each with an appropriate amplitude and phase. Longer wavelength (low frequency) phonons are exactly those acoustical vibrations which are considered in the theory of sound. Both longitudinal and transverse waves can be propagated through a solid, while, in general, only longitudinal waves are supported by fluids.

In the longitudinal mode, the displacement of particles from their positions of equilibrium coincides with the propagation direction of the wave. Mechanical longitudinal waves have been also referred to as &quot;&quot;. For transverse modes, individual particles move perpendicular to the propagation of the wave.

According to quantum theory, the mean energy of a normal vibrational mode of a crystalline solid with characteristic frequency is:

formula_11

The term represents the &quot;zero-point energy&quot;, or the energy which an oscillator will have at absolute zero. tends to the classic value at high temperatures

formula_12

By knowing the thermodynamic formula,

formula_13

the entropy per normal mode is:

formula_14

The free energy is:

formula_15

which, for , tends to:

formula_16

In order to calculate the internal energy and the specific heat, we must know the number of normal vibrational modes a frequency between the values and . Allow this number to be . Since the total number of normal modes is , the function is given by:

formula_17

The integration is performed over all frequencies of the crystal. Then the internal energy will be given by:

formula_18

== In quantum mechanics ==
Bound states 
in quantum mechanics are analogous to modes. The waves in quantum systems are oscillations in probability amplitude rather than material displacement. The frequency of oscillation, , relates to the mode energy by where is the Planck constant. Thus a system like an atom consists of a linear combination of modes of definite energy. These energies are characteristic of the particular atom. The (complex) square of the probability amplitude at a point in space gives the probability of measuring an electron at that location. The spatial distribution of this probability is characteristic of the atom.

==In seismology==
Normal modes are generated in the Earth from long wavelength seismic waves from large earthquakes interfering to form standing waves.

For an elastic, isotropic, homogeneous sphere, spheroidal, toroidal and radial (or breathing) modes arise. Spheroidal modes only involve P and SV waves (like Rayleigh waves) and depend on overtone number and angular order but have degeneracy of azimuthal order . Increasing concentrates fundamental branch closer to surface and at large this tends to Rayleigh waves. Toroidal modes only involve SH waves (like Love waves) and do not exist in fluid outer core. Radial modes are just a subset of spheroidal modes with . The degeneracy does not exist on Earth as it is broken by rotation, ellipticity and 3D heterogeneous velocity and density structure.

It may be assumed that each mode can be isolated, the self-coupling approximation, or that many modes close in frequency resonate, the cross-coupling approximation. Self-coupling will solely change the phase velocity and not the number of waves around a great circle, resulting in a stretching or shrinking of standing wave pattern. Modal cross-coupling occurs due to the rotation of the Earth, from aspherical elastic structure, or due to Earth&#x27;s ellipticity and leads to a mixing of fundamental spheroidal and toroidal modes.

<text>Harry Nelson Pillsbury (December 5, 1872 – June 17, 1906) was a leading American chess player. At the age of 22, he won the Hastings 1895 chess tournament, one of the strongest tournaments of the time, but his illness and early death prevented him from challenging for the World Chess Championship.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Pillsbury was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1872 and moved to New York City in 1894, then to Philadelphia in 1898.

By 1890, having played chess for only two years, he beat noted expert H. N. Stone. In April 1892, Pillsbury won a match two games to one against World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz, who gave him odds of a pawn. Pillsbury&#x27;s rise was meteoric, and there was soon no one to challenge him in the New York chess scene.

=== Hastings 1895 ===
The Brooklyn chess club sponsored his journey to Europe to play in the Hastings 1895 chess tournament, in which all the greatest players of the time participated. The 22-year-old Pillsbury became a celebrity in the United States and abroad by winning the tournament, finishing ahead of reigning world champion Emanuel Lasker, former world champion Wilhelm Steinitz, recent challengers Mikhail Chigorin and Isidor Gunsberg, and future challengers Siegbert Tarrasch, Carl Schlechter and Dawid Janowski.
The dynamic style that Pillsbury exhibited during the tournament also helped to popularize the Queen&#x27;s Gambit during the 1890s, including his famous win over Siegbert Tarrasch.

=== St. Petersburg 1895 ===
His next major tournament was the Saint Petersburg 1895–96 chess tournament, a six-round round-robin tournament between four of the top five finishers at Hastings (Pillsbury, Chigorin, Lasker and Steinitz; Tarrasch did not play). Pillsbury appears to have contracted syphilis prior to the start of the event. Although he was in the lead after the first half of the tournament (Pillsbury 6½ points out of 9, Lasker 5½, Steinitz 4½, Chigorin 1½), he was affected by severe headaches and scored only 1½ out of 9 in the second half, ultimately finishing third (Lasker 11½ out of 18, Steinitz 9½, Pillsbury 8, Chigorin 7). He lost a critical fourth cycle encounter to Lasker, and Garry Kasparov has suggested that had he won, he could well have won the tournament and forced a world championship match against Lasker.
=== US Champion 1897 ===
In spite of his ill health, Pillsbury beat American champion Jackson Showalter in 1897 to win the US Chess Championship, a title he held until his death in 1906.

=== Decline and death ===
Poor mental and physical health, the result of a syphilis infection, prevented him from realizing his full potential for the rest of his life. He died of the illness in a Philadelphia hospital in 1906, and was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Reading, Massachusetts.

== Lifetime records ==

Pillsbury had an even record against Lasker (+5−5=4), a feat matched or surpassed by few. He even beat Lasker with the black pieces at Saint Petersburg in 1895 and at Augsburg in 1900 (this was an , however, not a tournament game):


Pillsbury also had an even score against Steinitz (+5−5=3), but a slight minus against Chigorin (+7−8=6), Tarrasch (+5−6=2) and against Joseph Henry Blackburne (+3−5=4), while he beat David Janowski (+6−4=2) and Géza Maróczy (+4−3=7) and had a significant edge over Carl Schlechter (+8−2=9).

== Blindfold skill ==
Pillsbury was a very strong blindfold chess player, and could play checkers and chess simultaneously while playing a hand of whist, and reciting a list of long words. His maximum was 22 simultaneous blindfold games at Moscow 1902. His greatest feat, however, was 21 simultaneous games against the players in the Hannover Hauptturnier of 1902—the winner of the Hauptturnier would be recognized as a master, yet Pillsbury scored +3−7=11. As a teenager, Edward Lasker played Pillsbury in a blindfold exhibition in Breslau, against the wishes of his mother, and recalled in &quot;Chess Secrets I learned from the Masters&quot;:

But it soon became evident that I would have lost my game even if I had been in the calmest of moods. Pillsbury gave a marvellous performance, winning 13 of the 16 blindfold games, drawing two, and losing only one. He played strong chess and made no mistakes [presumably in recalling the positions]. The picture of Pillsbury sitting calmly in an armchair, with his back to the players, smoking one cigar after another, and replying to his opponents&#x27; moves after brief consideration in a clear, unhesitating manner, came back to my mind 30 years later, when I refereed Alekhine&#x27;s world record performance at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, where he played 32 blindfold games simultaneously. It was quite an astounding demonstration, but Alekhine made quite a number of mistakes, and his performance did not impress me half as much as Pillsbury&#x27;s in Breslau.

== Memorization skills ==
Before his simultaneous chess exhibitions, Pillsbury would entertain his audience with feats of memory that involved accurately recalling long lists of words after hearing or looking at them just once. One such list, which Pillsbury repeated forward and backward, performing the same feat the next day, was:

Antiphlogistine, periosteum, takadiastase, plasmon, ambrosia, Threlkeld, streptococcus, staphylococcus, micrococcus, plasmodium, Mississippi, Freiheit, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, athletics, no war, Etchenberg, American, Russian, philosophy, Piet Potgelter&#x27;s Rost, Salamagundi, Oomisillecootsi, Bangmamvate, Schlechter&#x27;s Nek, Manzinyama, theosophy, catechism, Madjesoomalops 

Irving Chernev and Fred Reinfeld, in the &quot;Fireside Book of Chess&quot;, state that this list was devised by H. Threkeld-Edwards, a surgeon, and Prof. Mansfield Merriman, teacher of civil engineering at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, who challenged Pillsbury in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before an exhibition in 1896. (Other sources cite the location of the challenge as London, UK.)

<text>The Citigroup Centre is a building complex in London. It houses Citigroup&#x27;s EMEA headquarters and is located in Canary Wharf in the city&#x27;s Docklands. The centre provides of floor space across two buildings - 33 Canada Square and 25 Canada Square (Citi Tower), and houses the bulk of Citi&#x27;s 9,000-strong UK employee base. The buildings were separated in 2023, prior to renovation of 25 Canada square.

25 Canada Square, stands at and, upon its completion in 2001, became the second-tallest building in the United Kingdom (only behind One Canada Square). Designed by César Pelli &amp; Associates, construction of the 45-storey tower - undertaken by Canary Wharf Contractors - began in 1998 and was completed in 2001, with Citigroup leasing the building from the outset. The building was bought by RBS in 2004 along with 5 Canada Square (leased to Bank of America) for $1.12 billion. Subsequently, on 2 July 2007, 25 Canada Square was individually sold to a joint venture between Quinlan Private and PropInvest for £1 billion (US$2 billion). Citigroup paid £46.5 million a year in rent for the tower, generating a yield of 4.6% to the owners. Citi later bought the tower for £1.2bn in 2019. The east facing side of 25 Canada Square up to level 40 is configured for use by tenants.

33 Canada Square, is the smaller of the two buildings in the complex, designed by Norman Foster and completed in 1999, two years before its neighbour. At tall, the building is made up of eighteen floors. The building is owned by Citigroup, and was built before the completion of the Jubilee line extension in late 1999.

In addition to main entrances from both Canada Square and Upper Bank Street, Citigroup Centre is also accessible via underground walkways from Canada Place shopping mall and Canary Wharf London Underground station - served by the Jubilee line. The Centre is also close to DLR stations Canary Wharf and Heron Quays, which provide connections with the City, London City Airport and surrounding areas.

In 2022, plans were announced to refurbish the 25 Canada Square Citi Tower building. The £100m redevelopment would incorporate holistic spaces such as parent rooms, prayer rooms and green spaces including a winter garden. By January 2025, refurbishment costs had escalated to over £1bn; work on site started in July 2023 with completion expected in 2026.

<doc id="478204" wikidata="Q241214" url="?curid=478204" title="Macanese pataca">
<text>The Macanese pataca or Macau pataca (; ; sign: MOP$; ISO code: MOP) is the currency of Macau. It is subdivided into 100 &quot;avos&quot; (; &quot;sin&quot;), with 10 avos called &quot;ho&quot; () in Cantonese.

Macau has a currency board system under which the pataca is 100 per cent backed by foreign exchange reserves, in this case currently the Hong Kong dollar (itself backed by the United States dollar). Moreover, the currency board, Monetary Authority of Macau (AMCM), has a statutory obligation to issue and redeem Macau pataca on demand against the Hong Kong dollar at a fixed exchange rate of HK$1 = MOP 1.03, and without limit.

== History ==

The Spanish dollar was in wide use in Asia and the Americas between the 16th to 20th centuries, and was imported by China in large quantities. They were typically minted in Mexico and then brought to the Philippines as part of the Spanish East Indies through the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade to be traded and circulated across the Far East. It was known to the Portuguese as the &quot;pataca mexicana&quot;. At the end of the 19th century various versions of this silver dollar or &quot;pataca&quot; were in use in Macau, in the form of Spanish dollars, the British trade dollars of Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements, as well as the silver dollars and fractional coinage of the neighbouring province of Canton.

In 1894, the pataca was introduced as a unit of account in Portuguese Macau and Portuguese Timor at a rate of 1 pataca = 450 &quot;réis&quot;, equivalent to the Mexican Peso or Philippine Peso. In 1901, it was decided to have a uniquely Macau currency, and for that purpose, the Banco Nacional Ultramarino was granted exclusive rights to issue legal tender banknotes that were to be denominated in patacas. On January 27, 1906, pataca notes in denominations of 1, 5, 50 and 100 were introduced and all foreign coinage was outlawed, the idea being to make the pataca paper notes the sole legal tender currency in Macau. However, the Chinese, being so accustomed to using silver for barter, were suspicious of this new paper money, and as such, the paper pataca always circulated at a discount in relation to the silver dollar coins. Conversely, a similar action at exactly the same time in the Straits Settlements, and for the same purpose, had the different effect of putting the new Straits dollar into the gold exchange standard. Hence both the Macau pataca and the Straits dollar were launched at a sterling value of 2 shillings and 4 pence, but where the Straits dollar remained at that value until the 1960s, the Macau pataca fluctuated with the value of silver, just like the Hong Kong unit.

In 1935, when Hong Kong and China abandoned the silver standard, the Hong Kong unit was pegged to sterling at a rate of 1 shilling and 3 pence, while the Macau pataca was pegged to the Portuguese escudo at a rate of MOP 1 = Esc 5$50. This meant that the Macau pataca was worth only 1 shilling and was therefore at a discount of 3 pence in relation to the Hong Kong unit.

The first exclusively Macau coinage was not introduced until the year 1952, which happened to be the year after the last pataca fractional coins were minted for East Timor. In that year in Macau, denominations below 10 patacas were replaced by coins.

In 1980, the Macau government set up the Issuing Institute of Macau (Instituto Emissor de Macau; abbr. as IEM), which was given the monopoly right to issue pataca notes. The BNU became the IEM&#x27;s agent bank and continued to issue banknotes. On agreement with the BNU on October 16, 1995, the Macau branch of Bank of China (, ) became the second note-issuing bank. The authority to issue patacas was transferred to the Monetary Authority of Macau.

== Coins ==
Coins were not issued for use in Macau until 1952, with the 20 cent coin of Canton Province circulating. In 1952, bronze 5 and 10 avos, cupro-nickel 50 avos and .720 fineness silver 1 and 5 patacas were introduced. Nickel-brass replaced bronze in 1967, including the last issue of 5 avos. Nickel replaced silver in the 1 pataca in 1968. In 1971, a final (.650 fineness) silver issue of 5 patacas was produced.

Brass 10, 20 and 50 avos and cupro-nickel 1 and 5 patacas were introduced in 1982. The 20 avos and 5 patacas became dodecagonal in 1993 and 1992, respectively, whilst a bimetallic 10 patacas was introduced in 1997 and a cupronickel 2 patacas in 1998. Coins are issued by the Monetary Authority of Macau.

== Banknotes ==

In a similar arrangement to the issue of banknotes in Hong Kong, Macau&#x27;s banknotes are not issued by a central bank or monetary authority but by two commercial banks, the Banco Nacional Ultramarino and the Bank of China. Owing to Macau&#x27;s Portuguese colonial past, banknotes are printed in Portuguese as well as Chinese, including the name of the Bank of China which is written as both &quot; and &quot;.

Following the initial issues of pataca banknotes in 1906, the new currency was supplemented the following year by 10 and 25 pataca notes, and in February 1920, 5, 10 and 50 avo notes were added. In 1923, the Banco Vui Hang introduced 10 pataca notes which stated that they were backed by Cantonese 20 cent coins. These notes were followed until 1934 by cashier&#x27;s cheques issued by various banks in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1,000 dollars, presumably equivalent to the pataca. The BNU issues were augmented by 1 and 20 avo notes in 1942, and in 1944, 500 pataca notes were introduced. Also in 1944, further cashier&#x27;s cheques were issued, denominated 1,000 yuan and NC$5,000. The 25 pataca note was discontinued after 1958.

On August 8, 1988, BNU issued a 1000 pataca banknote, the highest value banknote yet. Because 8 in Chinese (&quot;ba&quot;) is similar to &quot;getting rich&quot; (&quot;fa&quot;; ), this unique date, which occurs only once per century, gives the note a special meaning. Another feature is the replacement of the coat of arms of Portugal with BNU&#x27;s logo, shedding a political symbol in the prospect of reunification with China. In 1995, the Bank of China introduced notes in denominations of 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 patacas. Both the BNU and Banco of China introduced 20 pataca notes in 1996.

=== Current issue ===
Banknotes are currently issued in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000 patacas. The current series of BNU banknotes was issued in 2005, while the Bank of China notes were last issued between 1995 and 2003. The dimensions of the banknotes are the same as that of Hong Kong banknotes worth the corresponding number of dollars. On December 20, 1999, the day Macau was retroceded to China, banknotes of all values (except for 10 patacas) by both banks were reissued with that date. On January 5, 2009, the Monetary Authority of Macau announced a new series of banknotes, dated 2008, released by the Bank of China. In 2024, both the Banco Nacional Ultramarino and the Bank of China (Macau) are set to introduce a new series of notes. The denomination structure is the same as previous issues, but the notes come with advanced security features and include features accessible for those with visual impairments.




=== Commemorative issues ===
In 2008, the Macau branch of the Bank of China issued four million 20 pataca banknotes in commemoration of the 29th Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.

In 2012, the Banco Nacional Ultramarino and Banco da China issued ten million 10 pataca banknotes to commemorate the Year of the Dragon, and from 2012 to 2023, the Banco National Ultramarino and the Banco da China are each authorized to issue a maximum number of 20 million special notes with the face value of 10 patacas to mark each lunar new year. The Bank of China also issued a 100 pataca banknote to commemorate its centennial anniversary.

In commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the transfer of Macau to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Banco Nacional Ultramarino and the Banco da China issued five million 20 patacas banknotes. The front side of the notes feature the 7-ton gilded bronze sculpture &quot;Lotus Flower In Full Bloom&quot;, representing the prosperity of Macau. The back side of the notes feature the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge.

==Exchange rate==

Despite the fact that the pataca is the official currency of Macau, most of the money in circulation in the Region is actually Hong Kong dollars. Patacas accounted for only 29.9% of Macau&#x27;s money supply at the end of 1998.
The exchange rate is pegged and is approximately MOP 1.03 for HK$1, and Hong Kong dollar banknotes and coins are generally accepted at par or MOP 1. for retail payments. For United States dollars, to which the Hong Kong dollar is in turn loosely pegged, the exchange rate is around MOP 8 to 1 US dollar. Although it is possible to exchange patacas in Macau, it is either difficult or impossible to do so elsewhere. The few places in Hong Kong where patacas are available are concentrated on Cleverly Street in Central, a short distance from the Hong Kong–Macau Ferry Terminal.

Although the pataca is the legal tender of Macau, the Hong Kong dollar is almost universally acceptable in the region, and in some cases, is preferred to the pataca. Circulation of the pataca is mandated by a decree (Decreto-Lei n.º 16/95/M) prohibiting refusal by merchants, but some casinos flout this rule and refuse bets in patacas. The Hong Kong dollar and Chinese yuan are generally accepted throughout Macau from casinos to restaurants. Payments to government agencies can also be made in both Hong Kong dollars and patacas.

As Macau currently imposes no restrictions on the import or export of local or foreign currency, visitors can change their currency in hotels, banks and bureaux de change located all around the city including 24 hour currency exchange booths at Macau International Airport (Taipa Island) and at the Lisboa Hotel (Macau Peninsula) for customers if they want to change their currency into patacas outside working hours.

<doc id="478217" wikidata="Q2350561" url="?curid=478217" title="Stock Exchange Tower">
<text>125 Old Broad Street, formerly known as the Stock Exchange Tower and still often referred to as such, is a high-rise office building in London, located on Old Broad Street in the City of London financial district.

For over 30 years the Stock Exchange Tower was the home of the London Stock Exchange, until the latter&#x27;s relocation to Paternoster Square in 2004.

==History==
Standing at tall with 26 floors, the Stock Exchange Tower was completed by Trollope &amp; Colls in 1970 and officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 8 November 1972.

It served as the headquarters, offices and trading floor for the London Stock Exchange until the exchange departed for new premises in nearby Paternoster Square in July 2004. Face-to-face trading was conducted on the trading floor of the exchange until it was abolished in favour of electronic trading in the October 1986 deregulation of the London Stock Exchange known as the &#x27;Big Bang&#x27;.

On 20 July 1990, the Provisional IRA exploded a bomb inside the tower, causing its evacuation. The bomb destroyed the public viewing areas in the building which subsequently closed in 1992. It was also evacuated on 11 September 2001, after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City.

== Renovation ==
The building underwent a major renovation which saw its pre-cast concrete façade reclad in a glass curtain wall, and thousands of square metres of additional office space created, including a new 10-storey building at No. 60 Threadneedle Street, a six-storey wing to the east, and a single-storey wing to the northwest. As part of the renovation, the floor plates were extended beyond the perimeter of the original building to give more overall space. The renovation scheme was designed by Grimshaw Architects.

The building has 11 passenger lifts and one goods lift, as well as firefighting lifts and vehicle shuttle lifts.

<doc id="478221" wikidata="Q1034267" url="?curid=478221" title="Cape Ann">
<text>Cape Ann is a rocky peninsula in northeastern Massachusetts on the Atlantic Ocean. It is about northeast of Boston and marks the northern limit of Massachusetts Bay. Cape Ann includes the city of Gloucester and the towns of Essex, Manchester-by-the-Sea and Rockport.

==Etymology==
During the summer of 1606, French explorer Samuel de Champlain visited Cape Ann for the second time. He came ashore in Gloucester and drew a map of the Gloucester harbor, naming it as le Beau port. Eight years later, English Captain John Smith named the area around Gloucester &quot;Cape Tragabigzanda&quot;, after a woman whom he met while in Turkey as a prisoner of war. He had been taken as a prisoner of war and enslaved in the Ottoman Empire before escaping.

Smith presented his map to Charles I and suggested that Charles should feel free to change any of the &quot;barbarous names&quot; into English ones. The king made many such changes, but only four survive today. One was Cape Ann, which Charles named in honor of his mother Anne of Denmark.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of European settlers, Cape Ann was a home for indigenous people.
The English colony at Cape Ann was first founded in 1623. It was the fourth colonizing effort in New England after Popham Colony, Plymouth Colony and Nantasket Beach. Two ships of the Dorchester Company brought 32 in number with John Tylly and Thomas Gardner as overseers of a fishing operation and the plantation, respectively. At the Cape Ann settlement a legal form of government was established, and from that Massachusetts Bay Colony sprang. Roger Conant was the governor under the Cape Ann patent, and as such, has been called the first governor of Massachusetts.

This colony predated Massachusetts Bay charter and colony. For that reason, members of the colony were referred to as &quot;old planters&quot;. The first Great House in New England was built on Cape Ann by the planters. This house was dismantled on the orders of John Endecott in 1628 and moved to Salem to serve as his &quot;governor&#x27;s&quot; house. When Higginson arrived in Salem, he wrote that &quot;we found a faire house newly built for the Governor&quot; which was remarkable for being two stories high.

By 1634 the name of Cape Ann was already established, as it is mentioned and depicted on maps in William Wood&#x27;s &quot;New England&#x27;s Prospect&quot; first published in that year.

On November 18, 1755, Cape Ann was the land nearest the offshore epicenter of an earthquake, which is extremely rare for Massachusetts. There were no seismographs at that time; but, based on available data, the tremor was estimated at magnitude 6.5. It caused serious damage in the Boston area, but no casualties.

By the mid-1800s, Cape Ann was known for its specialization in granite production, specifically in creating paving blocks for roads and streets and were used across the United States from New York to San Francisco. 

Cape Ann became a thriving center of activity for artists in the 19th century, including the Rocky Neck Art Colony in Gloucester. Fitz Henry Lane who began his career in Gloucester as a lithographer developed a distinctive style for his marine paintings known as luminism. The Cape Ann Museum has a significant collection of paintings by local artists who reached national prominence. Later in the 19th and early 20th century, American Impressionists were attracted to Rockport such as marine landscapist Harry Aiken Vincent who arrived in 1916 and helped to form the Rockport Art Association. The region continues to provide a base for many galleries and working artists.

==Communities==

The entirety of Cape Ann lies within Essex County. Anchored by the city of Gloucester, the nexus of the local fishing industry, other towns on Cape Ann include Rockport, at the tip of the cape, and the towns of Essex and Manchester-by-the-Sea, which are located where Cape Ann joins the mainland.

==Geography==
At the end of Cape Ann, and splitting Gloucester into two parts, is the Annisquam River. Many locals who live in Gloucester and Rockport refer to the land east of the Annisquam as &quot;The Island&quot;.

==Popular culture==
Cape Ann is the subject of the folk song &#x27;Cape Ann&#x27;, which may have been written by Maine-based folk singer Gordon Bok. It describes a sailor and his negative feelings towards both Cape Ann and the sailors who sail around it. It has been recorded by musicians such as The Irish Rovers, Gordon Bok, and The X-Seaman&#x27;s Institute (formed as part of the South Street Seaport).

Cape Ann is the location of the fictional town of Sea Harbor, the setting of the &quot;Seaside Knitters&quot; mysteries by author Sally Goldenbaum. Sea Harbor is on the coast, with Gloucester as its nearest neighbor town. Cape Ann is also featured as the setting for the Harry Chapin song &quot;Dogtown,&quot; which is also the name for an abandoned town on the Cape.

The fictional &quot;Gloucester Island&quot; in 1966 Cold War comedy film &quot;The Russians Are Coming the Russians Are Coming&quot; is located off Cape Ann and was named for the city of Gloucester.

The book &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; mentions Cape Ann as the honeymoon location for the main character Billy Pilgrim.

The movie &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; was filmed in Gloucester in 2000. Setting out for the one last catch that will make up for a lackluster fishing season, Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) pushes his boat, the &quot;Andrea Gail&quot;, out to the waters of the Flemish Cap off Nova Scotia; based on actual events in 1991.

Cape Ann is also the location of main character&#x27;s home in the book &quot;Trouble&quot;.

Cape Ann is the title of the fifth and final section of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem, &quot;Landscapes,&quot; which lists the coastal birds of the region. Additionally, the title of his poem The Dry Salvages refers to a cluster of rocks &quot;off the N.E. coast of Cape Ann, Massachusetts.&quot;

The fictional town of Paradise, setting of the Jesse Stone novels, is near Cape Ann, which is briefly mentioned in &quot;Night and Day&quot;.

Cape Ann lends its name to a fictional coastal Maine town in the 1959 movie, &quot;It Happened to Jane,&quot; starring Doris Day and Jack Lemmon.

<text>Orcus (minor-planet designation: 90482 Orcus) is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper belt, with one large moon, Vanth. It has an estimated diameter of , comparable to the Inner Solar System dwarf planet Ceres. The surface of Orcus is relatively bright with albedo reaching 23 percent, neutral in color, and rich in water ice. The ice is predominantly in crystalline form, which may be related to past cryovolcanic activity. Other compounds like methane or ammonia may also be present on its surface. Orcus was discovered by American astronomers Michael Brown, Chad Trujillo, and David Rabinowitz on 17 February 2004.

Orcus is a plutino, a trans-Neptunian object that is locked in a 2:3 orbital resonance with the ice giant Neptune, making two revolutions around the Sun to every three of Neptune&#x27;s. This is much like Pluto, except that the phase of Orcus&#x27;s orbit is opposite to Pluto&#x27;s: Orcus is at aphelion (most recently in 2019) around when Pluto is at perihelion (most recently in 1989) and vice versa. Orcus is the second-largest known plutino, after Pluto itself. The perihelion of Orcus&#x27;s orbit is around 120° from that of Pluto, while the eccentricities and inclinations are similar. Because of these similarities and contrasts, along with its large moon Vanth that can be compared to Pluto&#x27;s large moon Charon, Orcus has been dubbed the &quot;.&quot; This was a major consideration in selecting its name, as the deity Orcus was the Roman/Etruscan equivalent of the Roman/Greek Pluto.

== History ==
=== Discovery ===
Orcus was discovered on 17 February 2004, by American astronomers Michael Brown of Caltech, Chad Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory, and David Rabinowitz of Yale University. Precovery images taken by the Palomar Observatory as early as 8 November 1951 were later obtained from the Digitized Sky Survey.

=== Name and symbol ===
The minor planet Orcus was named after one of the Roman gods of the underworld, Orcus. While Pluto (of Greek origin) was the ruler of the underworld, Orcus (of Etruscan origin) was a punisher of the condemned. The name was published by the Minor Planet Center on 26 November 2004 (). Under the guidelines of the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s (IAU) naming conventions, objects with a similar size and orbit to that of Pluto are named after underworld deities. Accordingly, the discoverers suggested naming the object after &quot;Orcus&quot;, the Etruscan god of the underworld and punisher of broken oaths. The name was also a private reference to the homonymous Orcas Island, where Brown&#x27;s wife had lived as a child and that they visit frequently.

On 30 March 2005, Orcus&#x27;s moon, Vanth, was named after a winged female entity, Vanth, of the Etruscan underworld. She could be present at the moment of death, and frequently acted as a psychopomp, a guide of the deceased to the underworld.

The usage of planetary symbols is no longer recommended in astronomy, so Orcus never received a symbol in the astronomical literature. A symbol , used mostly among astrologers, is included in Unicode as U+1F77F. The symbol was designed by Denis Moskowitz, a software engineer in Massachusetts; it is an OR monogram, designed to resemble both a skull and an orca&#x27;s gape. There is a rarer symbol , an inverted astrological Pluto symbol, reflecting Orcus as the anti-Pluto: it was designed by Melanie Reinhart.

== Orbit and rotation ==
Orcus is in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune, having an orbital period of 245 years, and is classified as a plutino. Its orbit is moderately inclined at 20.6° to the ecliptic. Orcus&#x27;s orbit is similar to Pluto&#x27;s (both have perihelia above the ecliptic), but is oriented differently. Although at one point its orbit approaches that of Neptune, the resonance between the two bodies means that Orcus itself is always a great distance away from Neptune (there is always an angular separation of over 60° between them). Over a 14,000-year period, Orcus stays more than 18 AU from Neptune. Because their mutual resonance with Neptune constrains Orcus and Pluto to remain in opposite phases of their otherwise very similar motions, Orcus is sometimes described as the &quot;anti-Pluto&quot;. Orcus last reached its aphelion (farthest distance from the Sun) in 2019 and will come to perihelion (closest distance to the Sun) around 10 January 2143. Simulations by the Deep Ecliptic Survey show that over the next 10 million years Orcus may acquire a perihelion distance (&quot;qmin&quot;) as small as 27.8 AU.

The rotation period of Orcus is uncertain, as different photometric surveys have produced different results. Some show low amplitude variations with periods ranging from 7 to 21 hours, whereas others show no variability. The rotational axis of Orcus probably coincides with the orbital axis of its moon, Vanth. This means that Orcus is currently viewed pole-on, which could explain the near absence of any rotational modulation of its brightness. Astronomer José Luis Ortiz and colleagues have derived a possible rotation period of about 10.5 hours, assuming that Orcus is not tidally locked with Vanth. If, however, the primary is tidally locked with the satellite, the rotational period would coincide with the 9.7-day orbital period of Vanth.

== Physical characteristics ==
=== Size and magnitude ===

The absolute magnitude of Orcus is approximately 2.3. The detection of Orcus by the Spitzer Space Telescope in the far infrared and by Herschel Space Telescope in submillimeter estimates its diameter at , with an uncertainty of . Orcus appears to have an albedo of about 21–25%, which may be typical of trans-Neptunian objects approaching the diameter range. The magnitude and size estimates were made under the assumption that Orcus is a singular object. The presence of a relatively large satellite, Vanth, may change them considerably. The absolute magnitude of Vanth is estimated at 4.88, which means that it is about 1/11 as bright as Orcus itself. The ALMA submillimeter measurements taken in 2016 showed that Vanth has a relatively large size of with an albedo of about 8 percent while Orcus&#x27;s has a slightly smaller size of . Using a stellar occultation by Vanth in 2017, Vanth&#x27;s diameter has been determined to be , with an uncertainty of . Michael Brown&#x27;s website lists Orcus as a dwarf planet with &quot;near certainty&quot;, Tancredi concludes that it is one, and is massive enough to be considered one under the 2006 draft proposal of the IAU, but the IAU has not formally recognized it as such.

=== Mass and density ===
Orcus and Vanth are known to constitute a binary system. The mass of the system has been estimated to be , approximately equal to that of the Saturnian moon Tethys (). The mass of the Orcus system is about 3.8 percent that of , the most massive known dwarf planet ().

The ratio of the mass of Vanth to that of Orcus was measured astrometrically with the ALMA submillimeter telescope and is with Vanth containing of the total system mass. This also means that the densities of both bodies are about the same at ~.

=== Spectra and surface ===

The first spectroscopic observations in 2004 showed that the visible spectrum of Orcus is flat (neutral in color) and featureless, whereas in the near-infrared there were moderately strong water absorption bands at 1.5 and 2.0 μm. The neutral visible spectrum and strong water absorption bands of Orcus showed that Orcus appeared different from other trans-Neptunian objects, which typically have a red visible spectrum and often featureless infrared spectra. Further infrared observations in 2004 by the European Southern Observatory and the Gemini telescope gave results consistent with mixtures of water ice and carbonaceous compounds, such as tholins. The water and methane ices can cover no more than 50 percent and 30 percent of the surface, respectively. This means the proportion of ice on the surface is less than on Charon, but similar to that on Triton.

Later in 2008–2010 new infrared spectroscopic observations with a higher signal-to-noise ratio revealed additional spectral features. Among them is a deep water ice absorption band at 1.65 μm, which is evidence of the crystalline water ice on the surface of Orcus, and a new absorption band at 2.22 μm. The origin of the latter feature is not completely clear. It can be caused either by ammonia/ammonium dissolved in the water ice or by methane/ethane ices. The radiative transfer modeling showed that a mixture of water ice, tholins (as a darkening agent), ethane ice, and ammonium ion (NH4+) provides the best match to the spectra, whereas a combination of water ice, tholins, methane ice and ammonia hydrate gives a slightly inferior result. On the other hand, a mixture of only ammonia hydrate, tholins and water ice failed to provide a satisfactory match. As of 2010, the only reliably identified compounds on the surface of Orcus are crystalline water ice and, possibly, dark tholins. A firm identification of ammonia, methane, and other hydrocarbons requires a better infrared spectra.

Orcus sits at the threshold for trans-Neptunian objects massive enough to retain volatiles such as methane on the surface. The reflectance spectrum of Orcus shows the deepest water-ice absorption bands of any Kuiper belt object that is not associated with the Haumea collisional family. The large icy satellites of Uranus have infrared spectra quite similar to that of Orcus. Among other trans-Neptunian objects, the large plutino and Pluto&#x27;s moon Charon both have similar surface spectra to Orcus, with flat, featureless visible spectra and moderately strong water ice absorption bands in the near-infrared.

=== Cryovolcanism ===
Crystalline water ice on the surfaces of trans-Neptunian objects should be completely amorphized by the galactic and Solar radiation in about 10 million years. Thus the presence of crystalline water ice, and possibly ammonia ice, may indicate that a renewal mechanism was active in the past on the surface of Orcus. Ammonia so far has not been detected on any trans-Neptunian object or icy satellite of the outer planets other than Miranda. The 1.65 μm band on Orcus is broad and deep (12%), as on Charon, , , and icy satellites of the giant planets. Some calculations indicate that cryovolcanism, which is considered one of the possible renewal mechanisms, may indeed be possible for trans-Neptunian objects larger than about . Orcus may have experienced at least one such episode in the past, which turned the amorphous water ice on its surface into crystalline. The preferred type of volcanism may have been explosive aqueous volcanism driven by an explosive dissolution of methane from water–ammonia melts.

== Satellite ==

Orcus has one known moon, Vanth (full designation ). It was discovered by Michael Brown and T.-A. Suer using discovery images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope on 13 November 2005. The discovery was announced in an IAU Circular notice published on 22 February 2007. A spatially resolved submillimeter imaging of Orcus–Vanth system in 2016 showed that Vanth has a relatively large size of , with an uncertainty of . That estimate for Vanth is in good agreement with the size of about derived from a stellar occultation in 2017. Like Charon compared to Pluto, Vanth is quite large compared to Orcus, and is one reason for characterizing Orcus as the &#x27;anti-Pluto&#x27;.Vanth is the third-largest known dwarf-planet moon, after Charon and Dysnomia. The ratio of masses of Orcus and Vanth is uncertain, possibly anywhere from 1:33 to 1:12.

<text>Mohanlal Viswanathan (; born 21 May 1960), known mononymously as Mohanlal, is an Indian actor, film producer, playback singer, film distributor, and director who predominantly works in Malayalam film industry besides also having sporadically appeared in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu and Kannada films. Mohanlal has a prolific career spanning over four decades, during which he has acted in more than 400 films. The Government of India honoured him with Padma Shri in 2001, and Padma Bhushan in 2019, India&#x27;s fourth and third highest civilian honours, for his contributions to Indian cinema. In 2009, he became the first actor in India to be awarded the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel in the Territorial Army. Mohanlal was named as one of &quot;the men who changed the face of the Indian Cinema&quot; by CNN.

Mohanlal made his acting debut at age 18 in the Malayalam film &quot;Thiranottam&quot; in 1978, but the film was delayed in its release for 25 years due to censorship issues. His screen debut was in the 1980 romance film &quot;Manjil Virinja Pookkal&quot;, in which he played the antagonist. He continued to do villainous roles and rose to secondary lead roles in the following years. By the mid-1980s, he established himself as a bankable leading actor and attained stardom after starring in several successful films in 1986; the crime drama &quot;Rajavinte Makan&quot; released that year heightened his stardom. Mohanlal prefers to work in Malayalam films, but he has also appeared in some of Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada films. Some of his best known non-Malayalam films include the Tamil political drama &quot;Iruvar&quot; (1997), the Hindi crime drama &quot;Company&quot; (2002) and the Telugu film &quot;Janatha Garage&quot; (2016).

==Early life==
Mohanlal Viswanathan was born in the village of Elanthoor in the Pathanamthitta district, Kerala on 21 May 1960. He is the youngest child of Viswanathan Nair, a former bureaucrat and Law Secretary with the Kerala government, and Santhakumari. He had an elder brother named Pyarelal (died in 2000, due to heart related issues). Mohanlal was named by his maternal uncle Gopinathan Nair, who initially decided to name him Roshanlal before choosing &quot;Mohanlal&quot;. However, his father avoided giving him their surname. His father was adamant that he should not bear their caste name (Nair) as surname which they all had. Mohanlal grew up in Mudavanmugal at his paternal home in Thiruvananthapuram. He studied at Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Thiruvananthapuram and graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Mahatma Gandhi College, Thiruvananthapuram. Mohanlal&#x27;s first role was as a sixth grader for a stage play called &quot;Computer Boy&quot;, in which he played a ninety-year-old man.

During 1977 and 1978 he was the Kerala state wrestling champion.

==Film career==

===Early years (1978–1985)===
Mohanlal made his acting debut in 1978 with the film &quot;Thiranottam&quot;, which was produced and made by Mohanlal and his friendsManiyanpilla Raju, Suresh Kumar, Unni, Priyadarshan, Ravi Kumar and a few others. Mohanlal played Kuttappan, a mentally disabled servant. Due to some issues with censorship, the film was not released on time. It took 25 years to release the film.

In 1980, Mohanlal was cast in the lead antagonist role in &quot;Manjil Virinja Pookkal&quot; – the directorial debut of Fazil. The film became a major success. Mohanlal&#x27;s friends had sent his application in response to an advertisement released by Navodaya Studio. He auditioned for the role in front of a panel that included professional directors. Displeased with his appearance, two of them gave him poor marks, but Fazil and Jijo Appachan gave him 90 and 95 marks out of 100. In an interview with Reader&#x27;s Digest in 2004, Mohanlal said that his looks as a young man might have fit the villain&#x27;s image. His acclaimed negative roles include &quot;Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu&quot; and &quot;Kuyiline Thedi.&quot;

By 1983, Mohanlal was credited in more than 25 feature films, most of them had him playing negative roles. Films such as &quot;Ente Mohangal Poovaninju&quot;, &quot;Iniyengilum&quot;, &quot;Visa&quot;, &quot;Attakkalasham&quot;, &quot;Kaliyil Alpam Karyam&quot;, &quot;Ente Mamattukkuttiyammakku&quot;, &quot;Engane Nee Marakkum&quot;, &quot;Unaroo&quot; and &quot;Sreekrishna Parunthu&quot; changed his image. Through Sasikumar&#x27;s &quot;Ivide Thudangunnu&quot;, he became a successful hero with a &quot;good heart&quot;. Mohanlal played his first comic lead role in an ensemble cast in the 1984 comedy &quot;Poochakkoru Mookkuthi&quot;, directed by Priyadarshan, as a young man in love with a girl whom he mistakenly believes to be rich. It also marked the beginning of the Mohanlal-Priyadarshan duo, who as of 2016, have worked together in 44 films.

In 1985, he recorded a song for the film &quot;Onnanam Kunnil Oradi Kunnil&quot;. &quot;Uyarangalil&quot;, &quot;Nokketha Doorathu Kannum Nattu&quot;, &quot;Boeing Boeing&quot; and &quot;Aram + Aram = Kinnaram&quot; were some of his films in this period.

===1986–2000===
During this period, Mohanlal played very different roles in films &quot;made by the great masters&quot;, such as G. Aravindan, Hariharan, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, Padmarajan, Bharathan and Lohithadas. Mohanlal, along with actor and scriptwriter Sreenivasan, who played his sidekick in several films, showcased the angst of unemployed, educated Malayali youth forced to adapt to hostile environments in many realistic social satires, some of which were written by Sreenivasan himself.

In 1986, he starred in &quot;T. P. Balagopalan M.A.&quot;, directed by Sathyan Anthikad, for which he received his first Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor. He portrayed an unemployed young man who shoulders the responsibility of his family. His performance in &quot;Sanmanassullavarkku Samadhanam&quot; as a harassed house-owner won him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Malayalam) in the same year. Mohanlal was given the status of a new Malayalam superstar by the public after the box office success of &quot;Rajavinte Makan&quot; (1986), in which he played an underworld don, Vincent Gomez. He also starred in the tragedy &quot;Thalavattom&quot;, playing Vinod, a young man who becomes mentally ill upon witnessing his girlfriend&#x27;s death. He played Solomon in Padmarajan&#x27;s &quot;Namukku Parkkan Munthirithoppukal&quot;. Mohanlal&#x27;s association with Padmarajan was very well noted because their films told stories that were well and truly ahead of their times and broke many conventional stereotypes prevailing during that time in the Malayalam film industry. In 1986 alone, Mohanlal appeared in 36 Malayalam films.

The following year, Mohanlal starred with Sreenivasan and Shobana in the Sathyan Anthikad comedy &quot;Nadodikkattu&quot;, which became a box office success. Mohanlal and Sreenivasan reprised their roles as the detectives Dasan and Vijayan respectively in its sequels; &quot;Pattanapravesham&quot; (1988) and &quot;Akkare Akkare Akkare&quot; (1990). &quot;Thoovanathumbikal&quot;, directed by Padmarajan, in which he portrayed a person torn between his twin love interests, broke many stereotypes in Indian films, such as, the leading man falling in love with a second woman immediately after he is rejected by the first, and of a man falling in love with a sex worker. The romantic comedy &quot;Chithram&quot;, released in 1988, played for 366 days in a theatre, becoming the longest-running Malayalam film. Mohanlal won a Kerala State Special Jury Award in 1988 for his acting in &quot;Padamudra&quot;, &quot;Aryan&quot;, &quot;Vellanakalude Nadu&quot;, &quot;Ulsavapittennu&quot; and &quot;Chithram&quot;.

In 1989, the combination of the writer Lohitha Das and director Sibi Malayil created the character Sethumadhavan, a person who dreams of becoming a police officer, but ends up as a criminal, in the tragedy &quot;Kireedam&quot;. The role earned Mohanlal a National Film Special Jury Mention. Mohanlal later recalled that his portrayal of Sethumadhavan&#x27;s mental agony, commended as a natural performance, was spontaneous and that he &quot;did what Sethumadhavan, my character, would have done in such a situation&quot;, adding that acting was &quot;akin to entering another person&#x27;s body.&quot; In the same year, he acted in a film which became a commercial success, &quot;Varavelpu&quot;, which tells the story of a man who earned money working in the Gulf and came back home to enjoy his life with his family. He bought a bus, which eventually gets him into trouble. The former Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, mentioned the film as an example of ignorance by Malayali towards global economic changes during the inauguration of the Global Investor Meet held at Kochi on 18 January 2003. In 1989, he starred in another one of Padmarajan&#x27;s movies; &quot;Season&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Mohanlal acted in a number of commercial films, such as &quot;His Highness Abdullah&quot;, &quot;Midhunam&quot; and &quot;No.20 Madras Mail&quot;. &quot;His Highness Abdullah&quot; was the first independent production of Mohanlal under his company Pranavam Arts International. Mohanlal appeared in Bharathan&#x27;s &quot;Thazhvaram&quot; in 1990, as a widower seeking revenge for the murder of his wife by his most trusted friend. His romantic comedy &quot;Kilukkam&quot; in 1991 won him a State Film Award for Best Actor. The film is considered one of the greatest comedy films of all time in Malayalam. It also became the highest-grossing Malayalam film of the time. In 1991, Mohanlal produced and starred in &quot;Bharatham&quot;, which is interpreted as a modern-day adaptation of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; from Bharath&#x27;s perspective. The film was a critical and commercial success, with his role as a Carnatic singer who is burdened by a jealous brother, earning him the National Film Award for Best Actor for that year. His role in Bharatham was listed among the &quot;25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian cinema&quot; by Forbes India on the occasion of celebrating 100 years of Indian Cinema. He portrayed a Bharatanatyam dancer in &quot;Kamaladalam&quot;(1992). He took help from his choreographer and his co-actors and professional dancers Vineeth and Monisha for enacting the dance scenes. &quot;Rajashilpi&quot;, &quot;Sadayam&quot;, &quot;Yoddha&quot;, and &quot;Vietnam Colony&quot; were his other films released in 1992. The drama &quot;Devaasuram&quot; (1993), written by Ranjith and directed by I. V. Sasi, was one of Mohanlal&#x27;s most successful films and is regarded as a cult classic.

In 1994, Mohanlal starred in the lead role as Dr. Sunny Joseph in the Fazil-directed cult classic &quot;Manichitrathazhu&quot;, as a psychiatrist. &quot;Spadikam&quot; was a 1995 work for which he won his third Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor and fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Malayalam) for his portrayal of Thomas &quot;Aadu Thoma&quot; Chacko, a young man who becomes a thug, estranged from his father, upon failing to meet the latter&#x27;s high expectations. In 1996, Mohanlal starred in Priyadarshan&#x27;s &quot;Kaalapani&quot;, an epic film about the prisoners in the Cellular Jail of Port Blair and Lohithadas&#x27;s &quot;Kanmadam&quot; (1998). He played the lead role in &quot;Guru&quot;, directed by Rajiv Anchal in 1997. The film was chosen as India&#x27;s official entry to the Oscars to be considered for nomination in the Best Foreign Language Film category for 1997.

Mohanlal acted in his first non-Malayalam film in 1997, in the Tamil biographical film &quot;Iruvar&quot;, directed by Mani Ratnam. The film, in which Mohanlal depicted an actor who turns to politics (based on the life of M. G. Ramachandran), was a critical success and won many awards including the Best Film award at the Belgrade International Film Festival and two National Film Awards. In 1998, he produced and starred in &quot;Harikrishnans&quot;, co-starring Mammootty and Juhi Chawla. The film was a commercial success, but was not well received by critics. The film had dual climaxes, which were screened in different regions, based on the popularity of the two lead actors in each particular region. This, however, became controversial and took a communal turn when lawsuits were filed claiming that prints exhibited in Hindu-dominated areas showed Mohanlal marrying the heroine, whereas the ones in Muslim-dominated areas showed Mammootty marrying her. The major issue was that the film showed uncensored scenes, as the submitted cut of the film to the Central Board of Film Certification was the version in which Mohanlal wins the leading lady. Hence they were forced to remove the Mammootty version from theatres, replacing it with the original. However, in television premieres, both film versions were shown.

Mohanlal depicted a Kathakali artist whose personal life is a tragedy in the 1999 Indo-French period drama &quot;Vanaprastham&quot;, produced by him and directed by Shaji N. Karun. It won him the second National Award for Best Actor and was the first film that got him international recognition by screening in various Film festivals. The film was selected for the competitive section at the Cannes Film Festival and his performance was critically acclaimed. It also earned him his fourth Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor, second National Film Award for Best Actor and sixth Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Malayalam). &quot;Vanaprastham&quot; was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the AFI Fest. &quot;Vanaprastham&quot; was screened in retrospective, during the 2014 International Film Festival of India in the &#x27;Celebrating Dance in Indian Cinema&#x27; section.

===2000–2009===

In 2000, Mohanlal starred in &quot;Narasimham&quot;, playing a rogue with a good heart. It became the highest-grossing Malayalam film of all time. In the next two years, Mohanlal was typecasted in similar larger-than-life action hero roles in films such as &quot;Ravanaprabhu&quot; (2001), &quot;Praja&quot; (2001), &quot;Onnaman&quot; (2002), &quot;Thandavam&quot; (2002) and &quot;Chathurangam&quot; (2002). Except for &quot;Ravanaprabhu&quot;, these films were widely criticised for their repetitive plots, lewd dialogues, punch lines and male chauvinistic outlook. A critic from &quot;The New Indian Express&quot; wrote: &quot;The &quot;Narasimham&quot; hangover is terrifically strong and it has, at least for the moment, killed the prospects of good films. I don&#x27;t see any other reason for the failure of well made female-oriented films like &quot;Mazha&quot; and &quot;Madhuranombarakkattu&quot;&quot;.

In 2002, Mohanlal played Sreenivasan IPS, a Mumbai police officer, in his first Bollywood film &quot;Company&quot;, which introduced him to the Hindi-speaking audience in India and for which he won the International Indian Film Academy Awards (IIFA) and Star Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film dealt with the real-life story of two underworld dons who ruled Mumbai (played by Ajay Devgn and Vivek Oberoi). Mohanlal&#x27;s performance was well received. &quot;The Hindu&quot; noted that the actor is &quot;at his natural best&quot; and &quot;does not look stifled or anxious as other South Indian stars do when they appear in a Hindi movie for the first time&quot;. In a 2010 online poll by Hindifilmnews.com, Mohanlal&#x27;s performance in &quot;Company&quot; was chosen as &quot;The Finest Performance of a Bollywood Actor in the Last Decade (2001–2010)&quot;. He was No. 1 in the audiences&#x27; list and maintained No. 6 in the critics&#x27; list.

The following year, Mohanlal, trying to change his action hero image, returned to comedic roles with &quot;Kilichundan Mampazham&quot;, &quot;Balettan&quot;, &quot;Hariharan Pillai Happy Aanu&quot; and &quot;Mr. Brahmachari&quot;. &quot;Kilichundan Mampazham&quot;, promoted as a comeback vehicle for the actor, received good reviews and a decent box office collection. &quot;Balettan&quot;, directed by V. M. Vinu, was also a commercial success. Mohanlal played Athanipparambil Balachandran, a bank employee always willing to lend a helping hand to others, who is forced to hide many secrets after his father&#x27;s death leading to his family&#x27;s mistrust. In 2004, &quot;Natturajavu&quot; and &quot;Mambazhakkalam&quot; were his only successes.

Mohanlal appeared in the 2005 black comedy &quot;Udayananu Tharam&quot; as an aspiring film director. It was well received by critics and performed well even in places where Malayalam films do not run in regular shows, such as Vadodara, Rajkot, Pune and Ahmedabad. In the same year, he appeared in director Blessy&#x27;s second film &quot;Thanmathra&quot;, a film that tells the story of an individual suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The film received positive reviews and Mohanlal&#x27;s performance was highly praised by critics. Mohanlal won his fifth Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor and seventh Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance. In the movie, his character does not speak in the second half.

In 2006, he worked with director Sathyan Anthikkad in &quot;Rasathanthram&quot;, a family drama. Mohanlal also acted in &quot;Kirtichakra&quot;, by director Major Ravi, in which he plays an Indian Army officer, Major Mahadevan. The film was shot in Kashmir, and was a notable commercial success. A dubbed Tamil version of the film was released in Tamil Nadu as &quot;Aran&quot;, but Mohanlal disassociated himself with the film since his voice was not used, stating that &quot;I prefer to speak for my role in the film.&quot; Mohanlal also acted in the sequels &quot;Kurukshetra&quot; (2008) and &quot;Kandahar&quot; (2010) in the Major Mahadevan series. In 2009, the Indian government conferred him with the honorary title of lieutenant colonel in the Indian Territorial Army.

In 2007, Mohanlal won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;Paradesi&quot;, directed by P. T. Kunju Muhammed. Sify.com stated that &quot;Mohanlal is mesmerising and reinvents the idiom of acting once more with feeling.&quot; His July release &quot;Hallo&quot; became one of the highest-grossing Malayalam films of the year. In August that year, he appeared in his second Bollywood film &quot;Aag&quot;, (also called &quot;Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag&quot;), a remake of the Bollywood classic &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975).

=== Stage performances ===

Mohanlal had acted in several amateur plays before entering into films. In 2001, he debuted in professional drama playing Karna (a character from the Indian epic Mahabharata) in &quot;Karnabharam&quot;, a Sanskrit-language play directed by Kavalam Narayana Panicker. It premiered at the Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi on 29 March 2001 as part of the National Theatre Festival of the National School of Drama. The play depicts Karna&#x27;s mental agony a day before the Kurukshetra War, as he thinks about his past and his faith. Mohanlal said: &quot;You cannot compare Kavalam&#x27;s play with the amateur plays I did. Though there are other characters in the play, the theme revolves around Karna. It is almost like a solo performance. Some of the scenes are really touching and challenging&quot;. He acted without payment, saying: &quot;I performed for the joy of it ... for my love of our history&quot;.

&quot;Kadhayattam&quot; was a presentation enacted by Mohanlal, performing ten classic characters and situations from Malayalam literature, selected from ten Malayalam novels written by O. Chandu Menon, C. V. Raman Pillai, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, P. Kesavadev, Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, Uroob, O. V. Vijayan, M. Mukundan, and M. T. Vasudevan Nair over a 100-year period. The play, directed by T. K. Rajeev Kumar premiered at the Senate Hall of University of Kerala on 1 November 2003, and later was staged in Kozhikode, Bangalore, Chennai and Delhi. In 2008, Mohanlal along with Mukesh performed in &quot;Chayamukhi&quot;, written and directed by Prasanth Narayanan. Mohanlal and Mukesh portrayed Bheeman and Keechakan respectively, the characters from &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. It had a play within a play narrative style. It premiered at the Lulu International Convention Centre in Thrissur on 12 March 2008, and later was staged in Thiruvananthapuram, Bangalore, Kollam, Kochi, and Kozhikode.

In 2014, Mohanlal and musician Ratheesh Vegha formed the music band Lalisom - The Lal Effect. Its maiden show was at the 2015 National Games of India. The band drew flak from social media initially for charging an amount of 1.63 crore and later for lip-syncing. Following the criticism, Mohanlal returned the amount to the government, which they refused stating that the government&#x27;s morality would not allow them to take back the money and Mohanlal had not personally benefited from the amount which he received, since it was meant to meet the stage expenses and remuneration for the artistes. Despite that, Mohanlal did not take back the money he dispatched.

In 2015, he collaborated once again with Mukesh for &quot;Naga&quot;, but this time as the narrator. The play, based on Girish Karnad&#x27;s Kannada play &quot;Nagamandala&quot;, was directed by Suveeran. &quot;Naga&quot; was a combination of myth, superstition, fact, and fantasy. It was premiered at the Parish Hall of St. George Church, Kalady on 9 August 2015.

Mohanlal was the captain of the Kerala Strikers team in the Celebrity Cricket League (CCL) held in 2012 and 2013.

===Escape art===
In 2008, Mohanlal underwent 18 months of covert escape artist training under magician Gopinath Muthukad to perform a stunt called the &quot;Burning Illusion&quot; in Thiruvananthapuram. However, due to pressure from fans and contemporaries, the act was canceled. The event was jointly organized by the Kerala Police, Department of Tourism, and the Kerala State Youth Welfare Board as part of &quot;Vismayam 2008&quot;, an international convention of magicians. The stunt involved Mohanlal being handcuffed and wrapped in chains, placed inside a box, and thrown into a ball of fire from which he had to escape.

Magician Samraj advised Mohanlal against the stunt and requesting that he withdraw. AMMA president Innocent also urged Mohanlal to refrain from the risky show. The purpose of the stunt was to inspire youth to overcome challenges in life. Mohanlal acknowledged the 50-50 risk involved but expressed hope for success. Muthukad emphasized that, although fire escape is one of the most dangerous acts, Mohanlal has been practicing to perfect it.

In 2014, Mohanlal performed a risk-free magic at the inaugural function of Magic Planet, a magic-themed complex in Thiruvananthapuram, founded by Muthukad. The chief minister of Kerala, Oommen Chandy, inaugurated the event, and Mohanlal&#x27;s act involved levitating a girl.

==Media image and artistry==

Mohanlal has been described in the Indian media as one of the most versatile actors and has been lauded for his natural acting style. Mohanlal is also known by his pet name &quot;Lalettan&quot;. Reader&#x27;s Digest India described him in 2004 as &quot;cinema&#x27;s jack of all trades and master of many&quot;. He was also listed 80th in India&#x27;s Most Trusted Persons, in a survey conducted by Reader&#x27;s Digest in 2010. Director Ram Gopal Varma has described Mohanlal as &quot;one of the finest actors in the country who can slip into any role easily&quot;. The actor has often been praised by his contemporaries in the Indian film industry, for his contributions to Malayalam cinema. 

In 2003, on the 25th anniversary of Mohanlal&#x27;s film career, a week-long celebration and a stage show were held in Thiruvananthapuram, by his fans and friends. The proceeds from the stage show were donated to charity. Malayalam television channels Asianet and Surya TV also held separate stage shows to celebrate the anniversary.

During the 1980s, Mohanlal and Mammootty emerged as &quot;superstars&quot; in Malayalam cinema, marking an unprecedented phenomenon in the industry. This led to a shift in the Malayalam film landscape, with star-driven films becoming the norm, reminiscent of Bollywood and Tamil film cultures. As &quot;India Today&quot; noted in 1988, filmmakers tailored characters to suit these superstars. Director I. V. Sasi remarked that even Prem Nazir never had the popularity of Mohanlal and Mammootty, who possess &quot;a rare and right mixture of charisma and acting ability&quot;. In 1988, filmmaker Fazil stated that, &quot;Mohanlal is the most flexible and subtle actor in the country today. He can do what Dustin Hoffman did in &quot;Tootsie&quot; or Silvester Stallone did in &quot;Rambo&quot; with ease&quot;.

In 2005, the films of Mohanlal, Mammootty, and Dileep accounted for 95 percent of the box office gross in Malayalam cinema. &quot;The Hindu&quot; wrote that &quot;Malayalam cinema revolves around them and scripts are written keeping their age and image in mind&quot;, they played larger-than-life characters with distinctive style of attire, dialogues, dance, and fight sequences. Mohanlal&#x27;s many fan clubs which are present throughout Kerala help in creating a buzz around new releases and ensure a good opening in movie screens, a crucial factor to the success of films in Kerala. In 2007, some social activists protested against Mohanlal for appearing in a whisky commercial, to which he responded that it is unfair to single him out when so many other Indian actors do the same.

In 2012, the forest department filed a case against Mohanlal under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 for possessing elephant tusks discovered during an income tax raid at his home. Subsequently, the tusks were returned to Mohanlal. Various petitions were dismissed in lower courts and the High Court of Kerala, alleging favoritism by the state government and department officials towards Mohanlal, and demanding a thorough investigation into the matter. In 2013, dismissing a petition, the High Court concluded that &quot;there was nothing to show that the State government or its officers had acted in favour of the actor. Besides, the petitioner had not been able to point out any illegality or irregularities in the investigation&quot;. Similarly, in 2014, the High Court dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) and criticized the petitioner, stating that &quot;there is no public interest in the petition, but it is aimed only at publicity&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mohanlal married Suchitra, daughter of the Tamil film producer K. Balaji, on 28 April 1988. The couple has two children – Pranav Mohanlal and Vismaya Mohanlal. Pranav has acted in a few films, debuting in Mohanlal&#x27;s &quot;Onnaman&quot; (2001). Mohanlal did not object when his son expressed a desire to act, as &quot;kids may have many such ambitions. If we can help them realise something, what is the problem?.&quot; He resides in Kochi, where he owns houses at Thevara as well as Elamakkara. He also owns houses in Chennai, his hometown Thiruvananthapuram, Ooty, Mahabalipuram, a villa in Arabian Ranches and a flat in the Burj Khalifa at Dubai.
Mohanlal is a self-described foodie. He also enjoys melodious music. Mohanlal is a strong believer in destiny and spirituality. He describes himself as a religious and spiritual person, and likes to read Osho, J. Krishnamurti, Aurobindo and Ramana Maharshi. He has often stated that the turn of events in his life, including his film career, was accidental.

In August 2021, Mohanlal received UAE Golden Visa.

<doc id="478226" wikidata="Q2418284" url="?curid=478226" title="New Brunswick Route 7">
<text>Route 7 is long and runs from Fredericton, near an interchange with Route 8, to an interchange with Route 1 in Saint John. Most of the highway is either a divided expressway or has limited access. 

Designated the [[Georges Vanier|Vanier]] Highway between Fredericton and an interchange with Route 2 (the Trans-Canada Highway) in Lincoln, Route 7 runs concurrently with Route 2 to Oromocto. From Oromocto, it turns south and passes through CFB Gagetown. 

== History ==
The main road from Fredericton to Saint John was first numbered Route 7 in 1965. The original routing followed present-day Route 102 from Fredericton to Oromocto, and the &quot;Broad Road&quot; (formerly Route 2A) from Oromocto to Welsford. The Vanier Highway, originally Route 12 when it was partially opened in Fredericton, was redesignated as part of Route 7 when it was fully completed to Oromocto in 1976, and a section of the Broad Road through Geary was bypassed in the early 1980s. The towns of Grand Bay and Westfield were bypassed in 1986, with the former alignment of Route 7 renamed Route 177.

In 1991, Route 7 was extended south from its original southern end at Ocean West Way (Route 100) on Saint John&#x27;s west side to Route 1.

Starting in 2007 planning commenced to construct animal fencing along a large section of Route 7. Construction began in the Fall of 2007 and continuing during the Summer of 2008. Animal crossings were also constructed in various places. Because the majority of Route 7 runs through CFB Gagetown, environmental assessments and approval had to be obtained from the Department of National Defence.

In October 2013, the Welsford Bypass opened and the uncontrolled section of Route 7 was renamed Eagle Rock Road. This new section by-passes the village of Welsford.

An earlier Route 7 went from Perth-Andover to Maine. This was renumbered Route 19 in 1965, and is now Route 190.

<text>Brassó was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in central Romania (south-eastern Transylvania). The capital of the county was Brassó (&quot;Brașov&quot; in Romanian, &quot;Kronstadt&quot; in German).

==Geography==

Brassó County shared borders with Romania and the Hungarian counties of Fogaras, Nagy-Küküllő, and Háromszék. The river Olt formed part of its northern border. The ridge of the Southern Carpathian Mountains forms its southern border. Its area was around 1910.

==History==
The Brassó/Kronstadt region was settled by German colonists since the 12th century. Brassó County was formed in 1876, when the administrative structure of Transylvania was changed, and was centered on the former Saxon seat of Kronstadt/Brașov. In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon, the county became part of Romania. Its territory lies in the present Romanian county of Brașov.

<doc id="478238" wikidata="Q389008" url="?curid=478238" title="After Forever">
<text>After Forever was a Dutch symphonic metal band with strong progressive metal influences. The band relied on the use of both soprano vocals and death growls.

In February 2009, it was announced that After Forever had disbanded. Singer Floor Jansen and keyboardist Joost van den Broek both collaborated again in ReVamp and Star One, before Jansen eventually joined Nightwish as lead singer in 2013. Former rhythm guitarist Mark Jansen founded Epica in 2002 after his departure from After Forever and, in 2010, founded MaYaN, which included former After Forever members Sander Gommans and Jack Driessen. Floor Jansen has appeared as a session or live vocalist for both Epica and MaYaN.

==History==
===First years and &quot;Prison Of Desire&quot; (1995–2000)===
After Forever was originally assembled in 1995, under the name &quot;Apocalypse&quot;. They were originally a gothic metal cover band with harsh male vocals. With the joining of vocalist Floor Jansen in 1997, their style and sound shifted towards symphonic gothic metal, in order to give emphasis to her soprano voice, in contrast with the grunts and screams provided by Sander Gommans and Mark Jansen. Their line-up at this point comprised Floor Jansen, Mark Jansen (no relation to Floor), Sander Gommans, Luuk van Gerven, Jack Driessen and Joep Beckers. Soon, the band began composing their own songs, and then they changed their name to &quot;After Forever&quot;, after the Black Sabbath song. In 1999, the band recorded two demos entitled &quot;Ephemeral&quot; and &quot;Wings of Illusion&quot;, which drew the attention of the Dutch Transmission Records label, with whom the band signed a contract.

Their debut album &quot;Prison of Desire&quot; was recorded in 2000, featuring a guest appearance of Sharon den Adel of the Dutch band Within Temptation on the song &quot;Beyond Me&quot;. The album obtained very good reviews in Europe. By the end of the year, drummer André Borgman and keyboardist Lando van Gils joined the band, replacing Joep Beckers and Jack Driessen.

During the year 2000, Floor Jansen was invited to guest sing in Ayreon&#x27;s &quot;Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer&quot; album. Ayreon is the most successful of the many projects by Dutch guitarist Arjen Anthony Lucassen and that album is only the first of many other collaborations with Floor Jansen.

===&quot;Decipher&quot; and departure of Mark Jansen (2001–2002)===
In 2001, the band released the album &quot;Decipher&quot;, which featured for the first time live classical instruments and a live choir. The complex arrangements of the new compositions pushed After Forever&#x27;s music even more towards the symphonic metal genre.

By the end of 2001, After Forever appeared as rising stars on the dynamic scene of Dutch metal, which included bands like The Gathering, Within Temptation, Gorefest and Ayreon. Their second album &quot;Decipher&quot; (2001) had received very positive reviews and their name was well known in the underground scene of the Netherlands. Critics were impressed by the remarkable musicianship of the young members of the band and in particular by Floor Jansen&#x27;s vocals, both in studio and in live performances. In contrast with these premises for a bright future, the relationships within the band were not so idyllic. Soon after the release of &quot;Decipher&quot;, After Forever faced a strong creative contrast between founding member and guitarist Mark Jansen and the rest of the band. Mark Jansen had been the main composer of the band together with Sander Gommans and his love for movie soundtracks and classical music had had a strong influence on the musical style of After Forever’s first two albums, &quot;Prison of Desire&quot; (2000) and &quot;Decipher&quot;. Moreover, his interest for religious and moral themes had characterized his lyrics for many songs, often collected under a common title (e.g. &quot;The Embrace That Smothers&quot; and &quot;My Pledge of Allegiance&quot;). In the next album, Mark Jansen meant to further explore complex interactions between classical instruments, choruses in Latin and death metal elements, while Gommans and the others preferred a more direct and aggressive approach to music, retaining some elements that made the sound of the band recognizable, but expanding it in new and different directions. These musical differences led to Mark Jansen leaving the band, in what he felt as an actual dismissal. Upon his departure, Jansen quickly formed another band called Sahara Dust, which later developed into the symphonic metal band Epica. In a 2007 interview, Jansen described his departure from After Forever as coming as a shock to him at the time, with the news of his dismissal being delivered to him by fellow band members shortly before a band rehearsal. At the time of his dismissal, the band were preparing to participate in a series of major tours and concerts such as Pinkpop. 

Jansen&#x27;s place was taken by Bas Maas, who had been the guitar technician for After Forever during the tours of 2001 and 2002. August and September 2002 were dedicated to a European tour, supporting Finnish act Nightwish and attending some rock festivals, which exposed the band to larger audiences and gained them even more favourable press. Further media exposure came from Floor Jansen&#x27;s collaboration with Dutch multi-instrumentalist and composer Arjen Anthony Lucassen, for the recording of Star One&#x27;s album &quot;Space Metal&quot; and the subsequent tour in late 2002.

===&quot;Exordium&quot; and &quot;Invisible Circles&quot; (2003–2004)===
Floor Jansen&#x27;s activities, as well as the regular jobs and studies of the After Forever band members, reduced the band&#x27;s live performances for the rest of 2002 and half of 2003. It was known that the band was working at a new album from the beginning of 2003, but their first release was the EP &quot;Exordium&quot; in October 2003, containing an instrumental track, three new songs and two covers.
In Jansen’s words &quot;the EP &quot;Exordium&quot; was like an introduction to this new full length album and the subjects of the lyrics are already connected to the concept (...) meaning they are also dealing with modern, social problems&quot;.

In 2004, the concept album &quot;Invisible Circles&quot; was released. The album, that deals with childhood traumas and abuse, introduced progressive metal elements to the music of After Forever and the use of a clean male voice. The album reached No. 24 in the Dutch Top 100 musical chart. In the same year, Lando van Gils also left the band and was replaced by Joost van den Broek, a keyboard player that Floor Jansen had met during her tour with Star One, another project by Arjen Lucassen.

===&quot;Remagine&quot; and signing to Nuclear Blast (2005–2006)===
In early September 2005, the band released their fourth album &quot;Remagine&quot;. The album was produced using pre-recorded drum tracks by André Borgman, who had to take a long leave of absence to cure his illness. The songs of the album are simpler and more straightforward than in the previous albums, preserving anyway the usual dual voice dynamic in the sound of the band.

On 3 March 2006 the band left the Transmission Records label, due to the scarce promotion that the label was providing to their albums. Following this departure, Transmission Records released the &quot;Mea Culpa&quot; compilation, with plenty of rarities and B-sides. By October the same year, After Forever had signed to the German label Nuclear Blast Records.

===&quot;After Forever&quot;, hiatus and disbandment (2007–2009)===
In late 2006 the band recorded what would be their final album, as well as their only album to be released through Nuclear Blast, the self-titled &quot;After Forever&quot;. It features guest appearances from Annihilator guitarist Jeff Waters and Doro Pesch. Videos of the recording sessions were available for download on the band&#x27;s website. The album was released on 23 April 2007.

In January 2008, After Forever announced on their website, that the band would be taking a break of at least a year, mainly to assess the health problems of vocalist and guitarist Sander Gommans, who had been absent during most of the tour supporting the album &quot;After Forever&quot;. In an interview with Ragnarök radio, Floor said the band would get together early 2009 to discuss After Forever&#x27;s future.

On 5 February 2009, After Forever announced that they decided to call it quits. The long break, during 2008 and 2009, had made them realize that they did not feel the passion towards the band any longer.

===Subsequent activities (2009–2017)===
After the split up of the band, Sander Gommans released the album &quot;System Overload&quot; in 2009 with his solo project HDK, followed by &quot;Serenades of the Netherworld&quot; in 2014. He also created Magic-O-Metal, a metal/comic project for children, and works as a high school art teacher.

Floor Jansen started a new band called ReVamp, which got signed by Nuclear Blast and released the albums &quot;ReVamp&quot; in 2010 and &quot;Wild Card&quot; in 2013. The band was on hold for a while after the release of &quot;ReVamp&quot; because of Jansen&#x27;s health problems and her subsequent recruitment as the new lead singer for Nightwish. Jansen&#x27;s involvement with Nightwish ultimately caused ReVamp to call it quits.

Joost van den Broek collaborated with both Gommans and Jansen on their new musical projects, while also leading several symphonic/crossover projects, particularly the Christmas Metal Symphony shows in 2008 and 2009 and Stream of Passion&#x27;s second album &quot;The Flame Within&quot;. He has since focused mostly on composing and studio work, but sporadically performs live, mainly as a session member of Ayreon and The Gentle Storm.

Bas Maas joined the live band supporting German hard rock singer Doro Pesch in 2008.

Both André Borgman and Luuk van Gerven joined Robby Valentine&#x27;s live band while After Forever was on hiatus. Borgman also joined Amanda Somerville&#x27;s band Trillium in 2017, thereby reuniting with his former band mate Sander Gommans.

===Reunion (2025)===
On 23 October 2024, the band announced that they will be performing two shows in October 2025 in celebration of the 25th anniversary of their first album. The line-up during these two shows are set to consist of Sander Gommans, Bas Maas, Luuk van Gerven, André Borgman, Mark Jansen, Jeffrey Revet and Angel Wolf-Black.

<doc id="478242" wikidata="Q620726" url="?curid=478242" title="Dundas, Ontario">
<text>Dundas () is a community and urban district in the city of Hamilton in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is nicknamed &quot;Valley Town&quot; because of its topographical location at the bottom of the Niagara Escarpment on the western edge of Lake Ontario. The population has been stable for decades at about 20,000, largely because it has not annexed rural land from the protected Dundas Valley Conservation Area.

Notable events are the Buskerfest in early June and the Dundas Cactus Festival in August.

== History and politics ==
=== History and politics to 1974 ===
Dundas was a prime location for hunting wildfowl, hence a &quot;hunter&#x27;s paradise,&quot; and was unofficially named Coote&#x27;s Paradise. It was renamed Dundas in 1814. It was named after Dundas Street (also known as Governor&#x27;s Road) that passed through the village, the road in turn named after Scottish politician Henry Dundas who died in 1811. Dundas is located along the street, which runs between Toronto and London, and is one of the earliest routes used by Ontario&#x27;s first settlers. The street is still known as Governors Road in parts, and both names are used in Dundas. It is designated Hamilton Road 99 and was formerly Highway 99, though changes to the historic road grid means the street is no longer a through artery to the east. An historical plaque commemorating Dundas Street is located on Governors Road. 

In 1846, this &quot;manufacturing village&quot; had a population of just over 1,700. The Desjardins Canal had been completed and connected the community with Lake Ontario, allowing for convenient shipping of goods. A great deal of cut stone was obtained from the &quot;mountain,&quot; and much of it was shipped to Toronto. There were six chapels or churches, a fire company and a post office. Industry included two grist mills, a furniture factory, a textile mill, and two foundries (for making steam engines). Tradesmen of various types also worked here. Four schools, six taverns, three breweries and a bank agency were operating. 
 Dundas was incorporated in 1847 from parts of West Flamborough Township and Ancaster Township in Wentworth County, Canada West.
The Great Western Railway (GWR) put their line through Dundas in 1853, but it was not until 1864 that the first Dundas station was built. By 1869 the population was 3,500 and was known as a small manufacturing centre.
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Dundas enjoyed considerable economic prosperity through its access to Lake Ontario via the Desjardins Canal and was an important town in Upper Canada and Canada West. It was later surpassed as the area&#x27;s economic powerhouse by Hamilton, but for decades it led in importance. 

With the establishment of McMaster University nearby in west Hamilton in 1930, Dundas gradually became a bedroom community of the university faculty and students, with a thriving arts community. Dundas has a large community of potters, and several studio shows and town walking tours feature their work each year.

The Dundas Museum &amp; Archives, located at 139 Park St. West, was established in 1956. Their collections, exhibits, and events showcase how Canadian history and geography have unfolded in the unique Dundas Valley. Several local events also occur at the Museum, including art shows, book launches, community celebrations, and more.

Dundas is home to the Dundas Valley School of Art. Marion Farnan and Emily Dutton established it in 1964. It became a non-profit corporation three years later. Since 1970, it has been located in the former Canada Screw Works building from the 1860s. 

The Carnegie Gallery is housed in the 1910 Carnegie library building and celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2005. It is run by the Dundas Art &amp; Craft Association and hosts art exhibitions, book readings, concerts, McMaster custom framing and a gift shop.

=== Music ===
&quot;Dundas, Ontario&quot; is also the title of a song from the album &quot;Start Breaking My Heart&quot; by the artist Caribou (formerly &quot;Manitoba&quot;), a native of the town. Dundas&#x27; sobriquet &quot;The Valley Town&quot; is used as the title of a song on the album &quot;Mountain Meadows&quot; by the band Elliott Brood; one of the band members, Casey Laforet, spent part of his childhood in Dundas. The town has produced other independent artists, including Junior Boys, Orphx, Koushik, and smaller bands such as Winter Equinox and The Dirty Nil. Folk singer Stan Rogers, who died in an airplane fire in 1983, lived in Dundas. He grew up in the Hannon area and moved to Dundas as an adult. He is best remembered for his songs about Canada&#x27;s Atlantic provinces.

Ryan van Sickle is another Dundas resident who became famous as a singer/songwriter. A notable aspect of his career is that he was one of the first musicians to embrace Google&#x27;s social platform Google+ and used it to become successful as an independent reggaeton artist with his album &quot;Ghosts of the Brokenhearted.&quot;

Dundas is home to the Dundas Valley Orchestra. The DVO is an amateur, community orchestra and was founded in the fall of 1978 by Arthur Vogt. Many have made the DVO a way station en route to successful musical careers. Former conductors include Rosemary Thomson, Michael Hall, Stephane Potvin and Dr. Glenn Alan Mallory. Laura Thomas currently conducts the DVO.

Dundas is also the home of Dundas Concert Band. The Dundas Concert Band was established in 1873 as a military band. In 1923, the band was renamed &quot;The Dundas Citizens&#x27; Band&quot; and became known as the Dundas Concert Band in the early 1940s. The Dundas Concert Band&#x27;s &quot;Concerts in the Park&quot; series has performed at the Dundas Driving Park Bandshell venue since 1958.

Dundas Conservatory of Music is located in historic downtown Dundas and has been providing musical instruction in the community for thirty years.

Avalon Music Academy, founded by Steve Parton, is in its 19th year of creating and nurturing musicians, many of whom have become professional performers. It uses the historic St. Paul&#x27;s United Church as its primary location.

=== Film ===
Because of Dundas&#x27; 19th-century downtown architecture, films such as Haven, &quot;Cabin Fever&quot;, &quot;Wrong Turn&quot;, and others have made use of its location. In December 2005, major filming was completed for &quot;Man of the Year&quot;, starring Robin Williams. Mr. Williams delighted townsfolk, taking time for pictures and autographs in the downtown core.

In early December 2004, &quot;The West Wing&quot; did some filming, remaking parts of Dundas (Town hall, a residence, and Deluxe Restaurant) into New Hampshire locales. The three episodes aired in late January and early February 2005. Several dozen enthusiasts of this HBO series braved chilly weather to witness the snail&#x27;s pace of television filming and grab autographs and photos with celebrities.

In September 2007, a scene of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; was filmed around the exterior and inside the DeLuxe Restaurant in Dundas, and other scenes were filmed at different locations in Hamilton.

From 2004 to 2007, parts of the YTV program &quot;Dark Oracle&quot; were also filmed in Dundas.

From 2015 until the present, parts of the W Network series &quot;The Good Witch&quot; have been filmed in Dundas.

=== Sports ===

The Dundas Blues are a junior ice hockey team from Dundas, and they play in the Provincial Junior Hockey League.

The Dundas Real McCoys are a senior ice hockey team from Dundas. They play in the Ontario Hockey Association&#x27;s Allan Cup Hockey league. The Real McCoys won the 1986 Hardy Cup as Senior &quot;AA&quot; champions of Canada and are the two-time defending Allan Cup champions at the highest level of senior hockey in Canada.

On April 3, 2010, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman named Dundas the winner of the 2010 Kraft Hockeyville competition during a live announcement on Hockey Night in Canada. As a result of being named the winner, the community received $100,000 CAD in arena upgrades and got to host an NHL pre-season game between the Ottawa Senators and Buffalo Sabres prior to the 2010–11 season.

After existing for 93 years, the Dundas Chiefs senior baseball team folded in 2010. The Chiefs had won 11 Ontario Baseball Association provincial titles over the years, with the first in 1961 and the last in 2001. Their success included three straight titles from 1976 to 1978 and back-to-back titles in 1987 and 1988.

== Geography ==
=== Waterfalls ===
Dundas is near two commonly visited waterfalls near the district of Flamborough. These are Webster&#x27;s Falls (named after Joseph Webster) and Tew&#x27;s Falls. Both waterfalls are accessible by the Bruce trail leading to the Dundas Peninsula.

In 1819, Joseph Webster purchased property on the escarpment above Dundas, including the waterfall, which still bears his family&#x27;s name. In 1856, his son built a huge stone flour mill just above the falls, but it was destroyed by fire in 1898. After the fire, one of the first hydroelectric generators in Ontario was built at the base of the falls. In 1931, a former Dundas mayor, Colonel W.E.S. Knowles, generously bequeathed monies so that the area surrounding Webster&#x27;s Falls could be made into a public park.

=== Dundas Peak ===

Dundas is also near the Dundas Peak, which is also in the Flamborough district. The Peak overlooks Dundas from The Bruce Trail in Flamborough and has become one of the most visited parts of Dundas. Hikers can take the Bruce Trail from Tews or Webster&#x27;s Falls to the peak and look over Dundas and West Hamilton.

== Landmarks ==

Dundas is famous for the Collins Hotel. After opening in 1841, it has since been the longest-running hotel in Ontario. One feature of the building is a front entrance (portico) with four fluted Doric columns; above them are triglyphs and metopes found on a traditional Doric entablature with a discrete cornice. The roof has a series of dormers with Florentine pediments. There are two floors to the hotel, the second of which has a balcony running the full length of the building. On the street level, there are shops.

<text>Matching Mole were an English progressive rock band associated with the Canterbury scene. Robert Wyatt formed the band in October 1971 after he left Soft Machine and recorded his first solo album, &quot;The End of an Ear&quot; (4 December 1970). He continued his role on vocals and drums and was joined by David Sinclair of Caravan on organ and piano, Dave MacRae on electric piano, Phil Miller of Delivery on guitar and Bill MacCormick of Quiet Sun on bass. The name is a pun on &quot;Machine Molle&quot;, the French translation of the name of Wyatt&#x27;s previous group Soft Machine.

==Career==
Their first eponymous album was released in April 1972, the bulk of which was composed by Wyatt himself, with the exception of &quot;O Caroline&quot; (a Dave Sinclair composition with lyrics by Wyatt about his recent breakup with girlfriend Caroline Coon) and Phil Miller&#x27;s &quot;Part of the Dance&quot;. Sinclair soon dropped out of the group and was replaced by New Zealand-born keyboard player and composer Dave MacRae, who had already played a guest role on the first album. Their second album, &quot;Matching Mole&#x27;s Little Red Record&quot;, produced by Robert Fripp of King Crimson, was released in November 1972. This album was more of a team effort, with Wyatt concentrating on lyrics and vocal melodies and leaving the composing to his bandmates.

Matching Mole disbanded in late September 1972 immediately upon completion of a European tour supporting Soft Machine, with Sinclair and Miller going on to form the more successful Hatfield and the North. A new lineup – consisting of Wyatt, MacCormick, ex-Curved Air keyboardist Francis Monkman and jazz saxophonist Gary Windo – was due to record a third album in 1973. This was cancelled when Wyatt fell from a window in June 1973, and was paralysed from the waist down, and therefore unable to continue drumming.

<text>Cour Saint-Émilion station () is a station on Line 14 of the Paris Métro. Opened in 1998, it is named after the wine of Saint-Émilion because it was built at the old railway station of Bercy where wine from Southern France arrived in Paris.

The entrance of the station opens onto Bercy Village, which is a commercial area of Paris that replaced the old wine warehouses of Bercy. This is an area specialising in good food. In the vicinity of the station, it is also possible to visit the Musée des Arts Forains (&quot;The Fairground Art Museum&quot;).

<doc id="478270" wikidata="Q3931689" url="?curid=478270" title="Regency architecture">
<text>Regency architecture encompasses classical buildings built in the United Kingdom during the Regency era in the early 19th century when George IV was Prince Regent, and also to earlier and later buildings following the same style. The period coincides with the Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, Federal style in the United States and the French Empire style. Regency style is also applied to interior design and decorative arts of the period, typified by elegant furniture and vertically striped wallpaper, and to styles of clothing; for men, as typified by the dandy Beau Brummell and for women the Empire silhouette.

The style is strictly the late phase of Georgian architecture, and follows closely on from the neo-classical style of the preceding years, which continued to be produced throughout the period. The Georgian period takes its name from the four Kings George of the period 1714–1830, including King George IV. The British Regency strictly lasted only from 1811 to 1820, but the term is applied to architecture more widely, both before 1811 and after 1820; the next reign, of William IV from 1830 to 1837, has not been given its own stylistic descriptor. Regency architecture is especially distinctive in its houses, and also marked by an increase in the use of a range of eclectic Revival styles, from Gothic through Greek to Indian, as alternatives to the main neoclassical stream.

The opening years of the style were marked by greatly reduced levels of building because of the Napoleonic Wars, which saw government spending on building eliminated, shortages of imported timber, and high taxes on other building materials. In 1810 there was a serious financial crisis, though the only major asset class not to lose value was houses, at least in London, mainly because the low level of recent building had created pent-up demand. After the decisive victory at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 ended the wars for good, there was a long financial boom amid greatly increased British self-confidence. Most Regency architecture comes from this period.

==Houses==
Many buildings of the Regency style have a white painted stucco façade and an entryway to the main front door (usually coloured black) which is framed by two columns. In town centres the dominance of the terraced house continued, and crescents were especially popular. Elegant wrought iron balconies and bow windows came into fashion as part of this style. Further out of town the suburban &quot;villa&quot; detached house was popular in a range of sizes. Whereas most earlier Georgian housing for the middle classes had little ornament, the Regency period brought modest architectural pretensions to a much wider range of buildings, in a relaxed and confident application of the classical tradition as filtered through Palladianism.

For large country houses a range of picturesque styles were available, and the Gothic Revival was gathering strength, with many architects able to turn to different styles as their patron required. Ashridge (to 1817), Belvoir Castle and Fonthill Abbey (to 1813, now demolished), were all by James Wyatt, whose late career specialized in extravagant Gothic houses. Sezincote House (1805), designed by Samuel Pepys Cockerell, is a Neo-Mughal country house for a &quot;nabob&quot; returned from British India. Brighton Pavilion (to 1822) by John Nash, the seaside home of the Prince Regent, is Indian on the exterior, but the interiors include attempts at a Chinese style by Frederick Crace.

==Churches==
Until the Church Building Act 1818, church building had been at a very low ebb for over 50 years. The Act allocated some public money for new churches required to reflect changes in population, and a commission to allocate it. Building of Commissioners&#x27; churches gathered pace in the 1820s, and continued until the 1850s. The early churches, falling into the Regency period, show a high proportion of Gothic Revival buildings, along with the classically inspired. Strict Greek Revival buildings were mixed with those continuing the modified Baroque and Roman Neoclassical traditions.

==Public buildings==
The period saw a great increase in public buildings, at both the national and local level. In London, three bridges were built over the Thames between 1813 and 1819: Vauxhall Bridge, Waterloo Bridge and Southwark Bridge, all privately financed by toll charges. Shops began to be included systematically into newly planned developments, and the covered arcade of shops was introduced, with the Burlington Arcade in London (1815–19) the earliest.

==Leading architects==
John Nash was the architect most associated with the Regency style; he was fully in tune with the commercial requirements of developers and designed the Regency terraces of Regent&#x27;s Park and Regent Street in London. He had many pupils who disseminated his style, or in the case of Pugin rebelled against it. In London itself there are many streets in the style in the areas around Victoria, Pimlico, Mayfair and other central districts. John Soane was more individualistic, one of a number of European experimenters in Neoclassicism, but details from his inventive buildings were often picked up by other architects.

The public buildings of George Dance the Younger, City Architect of London from 1768, were precursors of the Regency style, though he designed little himself after 1798. Robert Smirke could produce both classical (British Museum) and Gothic designs, and also mainly worked on public buildings. With Nash and Soane he was one of the Board of Works&#x27; architects during the peak Regency period. A large commission of the period was the expansion of Windsor Castle for the king, which eventually cost over a million pounds, over three times the original budget. Smirke, Nash, Soane and Jeffry Wyatville were invited to tender, Wyatville winning the competition. He was a prolific designer, mostly for country houses, new-built or refurbished, able to work in a variety of styles. His uncle James Wyatt was a leading architect of the previous generation, and James&#x27; sons Benjamin Dean Wyatt and Philip Wyatt were also successful architects in the period.

==Locations==
Apart from London, a number of English towns hold especial concentrations of Regency architecture. Several of the least-spoiled of these are new resort towns, attempting to emulate the success of Bath, Somerset and Buxton, spas which had been extensively developed in the mid-century Georgian period and the 1780s respectively. Brighton and other coastal resorts had become fashionable, and other towns that greatly expanded were Royal Leamington Spa in Warwickshire, the Clifton suburb of Bristol, Tunbridge Wells, Newcastle upon Tyne, and Cheltenham, &quot;perhaps the most complete surviving Regency town&quot;.

Excellent examples of Regency properties dominate Brighton and Hove in East Sussex; in particular in its Kemp Town and Brunswick (Hove) estates.

<doc id="478274" wikidata="Q283353" url="?curid=478274" title="Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda">
<text>Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda y Arteaga (March 23, 1814 – February 1, 1873) was a 19th-century Cuban-born Spanish writer. Born in Puerto Príncipe, now Camagüey, she lived in Cuba until she was 22. Her family moved to Spain in 1836, where she started writing as La Peregrina (&quot;The Pilgrim&quot;) and lived there until 1859, when she moved back to Cuba with her second husband until his death in 1863, after which she moved back to Spain. She died in Madrid in 1873 from diabetes at the age of 58.

She was a prolific writer and wrote 20 plays and numerous poems. Her most famous work, however, is the antislavery novel &quot;Sab&quot;, published in Madrid in 1841. The eponymous protagonist is a slave who is deeply in love with his mistress Carlota, who is entirely oblivious to his feelings for her.

==Life==

===Early life===
María Gertrudis de los Dolores Gómez de Avellaneda y Arteaga was born on March 23, 1814, in Santa María de Puerto Príncipe, which was often referred to simply as Puerto Príncipe and which is now known as Camagüey. Puerto Príncipe was a provincial capital in central Cuba in Avellaneda&#x27;s day, and Cuba was a region of Spain. Her father, Manuel Gómez de Avellaneda y Gil de Taboada, had arrived in Cuba in 1809 and was a Spanish naval officer in charge of the port of Nuevitas. Her mother, Francisca María del Rosario de Arteaga y Betancourt, was a &quot;criolla&quot; with ascendants from the Basque Country and the Canary Islands, member of the wealthy Arteaga y Betancourt family, which was one of the most prominent and important families in Puerto Príncipe. Avellaneda was the first of five children from her parents&#x27; marriage, but only she and her younger brother Manuel survived childhood.
Her father died in 1823 when she was nine years old, and her mother remarried ten months later to Gaspar Isidoro de Escalada y López de la Peña, who was a Spanish lieutenant colonel posted in Puerto Príncipe. Avellaneda strongly disliked him and thought that he was too strict; she was glad whenever he was stationed away from home. From the time her mother remarried until the time she left Cuba for Spain, Avellaneda only saw her stepfather two or three months a year. She had two older half-siblings from her father&#x27;s first marriage named Manuel and Gertrudis, a younger brother also named Manuel, and three younger half-siblings from her mother&#x27;s marriage to Escalada: Felipe, Josefa, and Emilio. Little is known about Avellaneda&#x27;s relationship with her older half-siblings, except that they lived somewhere else. Her younger brother Manuel was her favorite, and she was in charge of her three younger half-siblings.

When she was 13 years old she was betrothed to a distant relative who was one of the wealthiest men in Puerto Príncipe. Her maternal grandfather promised her a fifth of his estate if she went through with this marriage, which he had arranged himself. At the age of 15 she broke off that engagement against her family&#x27;s wishes, and as a result she was left out of her grandfather&#x27;s will. (Her grandfather died in 1832, when she was 17 or 18.) It is thought that this traumatic experience fueled her hatred of arranged marriages and patriarchal authority and her belief that married women were essentially slaves. Her aversion to marriage was also due to the unhappy marriage of her cousin Angelita, who was her only friend after she refused to marry the man her family had chosen for her.

Avellaneda was, by her own admission, a spoiled child, as her family&#x27;s slaves did all the chores. She had a lot of free time, which she used to read voraciously. One of her tutors was the Cuban poet José María Heredia.

===Move to Spain===

By 1836 Escalada had become concerned enough about the possibility of a slave rebellion that he persuaded his wife to sell off her property and slaves and move the family from Cuba to Spain. Avellaneda, now 22, supported the idea because she wanted to meet her father&#x27;s relatives in Andalusia. The family set sail for Europe on April 9, 1836, and arrived in Bordeaux, France two months later. They spent 18 days there before sailing to A Coruña in Galicia, Spain. They stayed in A Coruña with Escalada&#x27;s family for two years. Avellaneda was invited into some distinguished social circles in Galicia and in 1837 was engaged to Francisco Ricafort, son of Mariano Ricafort, the Captain-General of Galicia at the time. She did not marry him, however, as she had decided not marry until she was economically independent, and her stepfather withheld her inheritance. When Francisco was sent to fight in the Carlist Wars, she left Galicia to go to Seville with her younger brother Manuel; she would never see him again. She was glad to leave Galicia, as she was criticized by Galician women for her refusal to do manual labor and for her love of study. She also disliked the damp climate and lack of cultural life.

In the province of Seville in Andalusia she visited Constantina, where her father&#x27;s family lived. In 1839, shortly after her arrival in Seville, she met and fell deeply in love with Ignacio de Cepeda y Alcalde, a wealthy, well-educated, and socially prominent young man. The first man that Avellaneda had a loved was Ignacio de Cepeda, who was the focus of many of her writings, mainly love letters. (There were forty love letters total, spanning from 1839 until 1854. After his death, his widow inherited and published them.) She also wrote him an autobiography in July 1839. Biographers of Avellaneda have relied too heavily on this account for information about her early life, as it was written for a specific purpose: to make a good impression on Cepeda. For example, she said that she was younger than she really was because Cepeda was two years younger than her, and she wanted to make herself look as young as possible. Because of the over-reliance on this biased source, few details are known for certain about the first 22 years of her life. The autobiography written to Cepeda was the second of the four autobiographies she wrote during her lifetime; the other three were written in 1838, 1846, and 1850, respectively. Though she loved Cepeda very much, he did not want to pursue a marriage with her. One reason he gave was that she was not rich enough. He also gave as a reason that she was not feminine enough, stating that she was more talkative than should be and was often too aggressive for a woman of the 19th century. After her relationship with Cepeda ended, she went to Madrid.

In Madrid she had a number of tumultuous love affairs, some with prominent writers associated with Spanish Romanticism. Her affairs included several engagements to different men. There she met and had an affair with Gabriel Garcia Tassara. He was also a poet from Seville. In 1844, she had a daughter out of wedlock with Tassara. Soon after the baby was born, Tassara left her and the baby, refusing to call her his daughter. The baby died several months later. This left Avellaneda heartbroken at the height of her career.

Avellaneda soon married a younger man, don Pedro Sabater, who worked for the Cortes and was very wealthy. He was also a writer and wrote many poems for his wife. They married on May 10, 1846. Sabater was extremely ill with what was believed to be cancer. He died shortly after their marriage, leaving Avellaneda devastated. As a result, she entered a convent right after his death and wrote a play called &quot;Egilona&quot; which did not receive good reviews like her last one had.

In January 1853, she tried to enroll into the Royal Academy in after a seat belonging to a dead friend of hers, Juan Nicasio Gallego, became vacant. Even though she was admired by many, being a woman meant that it was not her place to be writing publicly. Despite being from an wealthy and well-known upper-class family, the fame she desired from writing did not come easily. While all the males in the academy were aware of her works and were fascinated by them, they did not give her the right to enter, solely based on the fact that she was a woman.

===Return to Cuba===

She remarried on April 26, 1855, to a colonel, don Domingo Verdugo y Massieu. In 1859, due to her husband&#x27;s injuries they moved from Madrid back to Cuba, where both were born. They were close to Francisco Serrano, who was the captain-general of Cuba at the time. When she arrived in Cuba, she was warmly welcomed with concerts, parties, and music. Shortly after their arrival, Verdugo&#x27;s health worsened and he finally died on October 28, 1863. This left her in severe distress, and she decided return to Madrid after a few visits to New York, London, Paris and Seville.

===Final years and death===
She lived in Madrid her last years. Her brother Manuel died in 1868. She published the first volume of her collected literary works (), omitting the novels &quot;Sab&quot; and &quot;Dos mujeres&quot;.

At 58, she died on February 1, 1873, in Madrid, but she was buried in Seville, with her brother Manuel.

==Literary works==
Al partir
&lt;poem&gt;¡Perla del mar! ¡Estrella de Occidente!
¡Hermosa Cuba! Tu brillante cielo
la noche cubre con su opaco velo
como cubre el dolor mi triste frente.

¡Voy a partir!...La chusma diligente
para arrancarme del nativo suelo
las velas iza, y pronto a su desvelo
la brisa acude de tu zona ardiente.

¡Adiós, patria feliz, edén querido!
¡Doquier que el hado en su furor me impela,
tu dulce nombre halagará mi oído!

¡Adiós¡... Ya cruje la turgente vela…
El ancla se alza... el buque,
estremecido,
las olas corta y silencioso vuela!
&lt;/poem&gt;

Al partir&lt;br&gt;&quot;On leaving&quot;
&lt;poem&gt;Pearl of the sea! Star of the Occident!
Beautiful Cuba! Night’s murky veil
Is drawn across the sky’s refulgent trail,
And I succumb to sorrow’s ravishment.

Now I depart! …As to their labors bent,
The crewmen now their tasks assail,
To wrest me from my home, they hoist the sail
To catch the ardent winds that you have sent.

Farewell, my Eden, land so dear!
Whatever in its furor fate now sends,
Your cherished name will grace my ear!

Farewell!... The anchor from the sea ascends,
The sails are full…. The ship breaks clear,
And with soft quiet motion, wave and water fends. 4
&lt;/poem&gt;

Gomez de Avellaneda was often either praised or shunned for her literary works. She wrote poems, autobiographies, novels and plays. During the 1840s and 1850s was when she was most famous for her writings. She had other female rivals in writing such as Carolina Coronado and Rosalia de Castro but none of them achieved as much praise as Gomez de Avellaneda received from her literary works. She inspired men and women alike with her stories of love, feminism, and a changing world.

Her poetry consists of styles in Hispanic poetry from late neoclassicism through romanticism. Her works are influenced by some of the major French, English, Spanish, and Latin American poets. Her poems reflects her life experiences including her rebellious attitude and independence in a male-dominated society (regarding herself as a woman writer); sense of loneliness and exile from her Cuba (regarding her love for Cuba); and melancholy and depression (regarding her heartbroken affairs). Her poetry surrounds the themes of Cuba, love and eroticism, poetry itself, neoclassical concepts, historical references, religion, philosophical meditations, personal and public occasions, and poetic portraits.

The theme of Cuba is evident in her poem “Al partir” (“On Leaving”), which was in 1836 when la Avellaneda was on the boat leaving Cuba for Spain. It is a sonnet about her love for Cuba and reflects her emotions as she departed.

==Novels==

The most controversial and the first novel she wrote, &quot;Sab&quot;, was published in 1841. This novel can be compared to &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; in that both novels are literary protests against the practice of slavery. &quot;Sab&quot; is about a Cuban slave, named Sab, who is in love with Carlota, his master&#x27;s daughter. Carlota (the heroine) marries a rich white Englishman, Enrique Otway. The book stresses Sab&#x27;s moral superiority over the white characters. This is because his soul is pure while the Englishman&#x27;s business interests are his primary concern. The enterprises of Enrique and his father are juxtaposed against the Carlota&#x27;s family &quot;ingenio&quot; (sugarcane plantation) which is in decline because Carlota&#x27;s father is of a good nature, which means he cannot be a good business man.

&quot;Sab&quot; was banned in Cuba for its unconventional approach to society and its problems. Avellaneda&#x27;s works were considered scandalous because of her recurrent themes of interracial love and society&#x27;s divisions. In fact, &quot;Sab&quot; could be considered an early example of negrismo, a literary tendency when white creole authors depicted black people, usually with a favorable stance. This kind of writing was often cultivated by women authors who might have been arguing, as Gómez de Avellaneda was, that there was a parallel between the black condition and the female condition. Two other Creole women who cultivated negrista fiction were the Argentine Juana Manuela Gorriti (&quot;Peregrinaciones de una alma triste&quot; &amp; &quot;El ángel caído&quot;) and the Peruvian Teresa González de Fanning whose Roque Moreno paints a less than sympathetic stance toward blacks and mulattoes. Of course Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; could also be understood in this light.

Two famous poems were from her love letters to Ignacio de Cepeda. Both were called “A él” (“To Him”). The poems reflect her theme of love for Cepeda. The first poem, much longer and more complex than the second, regards her hope in being with Cepeda. However, because Cepeda did not want a committed relationship with her and married another woman, it made la Avellaneda suffer. As a result, the second poem is about their final break, her resignation to their relationship.

==Legacy==

There has been much debate over whether Gertrud&#x27;s Gómez de Avellaneda is a Cuban or Spanish writer. She is widely viewed as the &quot;epitome of the Romantic poet, the tragic heroine who rises to public acclaim yet, in private, is bitterly unhappy.&quot; Whatever the accuracy of this image, it is clear that she actively promoted it during her life and that many influential critics and admirers continued to promote this image of Avellaneda after her death. Also, much of her work is read from a biographical perspective because of the posthumous publication of her love letters to Ignacio Cepeda, to the extent that her life has overshadowed the wider cultural significance of her literary output.

<doc id="478276" wikidata="Q203480" url="?curid=478276" title="Phaethon">
<text>Phaethon (; , ), also spelled Phaëthon, is the son of the Oceanid Clymene and the sun god Helios in Greek mythology.

According to most authors, Phaethon is the son of Helios who, out of a desire to have his parentage confirmed, travels to the sun god&#x27;s palace in the east. He is recognised by his father and asks for the privilege of driving his chariot for a single day. Despite Helios&#x27; fervent warnings and attempts to dissuade him, counting the numerous dangers he would face in his celestial journey and reminding Phaethon that only he can control the horses, the boy is not dissuaded and does not change his mind. He is then allowed to take the chariot&#x27;s reins; his ride is disastrous, as he cannot keep a firm grip on the horses. As a result, he drives the chariot too close to the Earth, burning it, and too far from it, freezing it.

In the end, after many complaints, from the stars in the sky to the Earth itself, Zeus strikes Phaethon with one of his lightning bolts, killing him instantly. His dead body falls into the river Eridanus, and his sisters, the Heliades, cry tears of amber and are turned to black poplar as they mourn him.

Phaethon&#x27;s tale was commonly used to explain why uninhabitable lands on both sides of extremity (such as hot deserts and frozen wastelands) exist, and why certain peoples have darker complexions, while his sisters&#x27; amber tears accounted for the river&#x27;s rich deposits of amber.

== Etymology ==
 means &quot;radiant&quot;, from the verb , meaning &quot;to shine.&quot; Therefore, his name could be understood as, &quot;the shining/radiant (one)&quot; Ultimately the word derives from , &quot;phaos&quot;, the Greek word for light, from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*bheh2-&quot;, &#x27;to shine.&#x27;

== Mythology ==
Details vary across different versions, but most have Phaethon travel far east to meet his father, sometimes in order to get him to assure his paternity. There, he asks Helios for permission to drive his father&#x27;s Sun-chariot for a single day. Despite Helios&#x27; protests and advice against, Phaethon does not back down from his initial wish, and thus Helios reluctantly allows him to drive his chariot. Placed in charge of the chariot, Phaethon was unable to control the horses. In some versions, the Earth first froze when the horses climbed too high, but when the chariot then scorched the Earth by swinging too near, Zeus decided to prevent disaster by striking it down with a thunderbolt. Phaethon fell to Earth and was killed in the process.

=== Family ===
Phaethon was said to be the son of Clymene the Oceanid and Helios, god of the sun. Alternatively, less common genealogies make him a son of Clymenus by a different Oceanid, Merope, of Helios and Rhodos and thus a full brother of the Heliadae, or of Helios and Prote. According to a scholion on the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Phaethon&#x27;s mother Clymene was not an Oceanid, but rather a mortal woman, a daughter of Minyas, who married Helios.

=== Homer and Hesiod ===
Although Helios himself is present in their works, for the two earliest ancient Greek authors, Homer and Hesiod, the chariot and the four horses that pull Helios each morning do not seem to exist at all; the oldest work in which they appear being the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;.

Neither seems to know Phaethon as an individual, as &quot;Phaethon&quot;, meaning &quot;the radiant&quot; seems to be exclusively an epithet used for Helios by them. The only Phaethon Hesiod seems to recognize is the son of Eos, Helios&#x27; sister and the goddess of the dawn, whom she had by her lover Cephalus, an Athenian prince.

The late Roman author Hyginus however attributes a version of the story to Hesiod. According to Hyginus, Hesiod wrote that Phaethon was the son of Merope, an Oceanid, and Clymenus, a son of Helios by an unnamed woman or goddess. Phaethon, upon learning that his grandfather is the Sun, put his chariot to bad use, and scorched the Earth, turning the Indians black in the process. He was struck by a thunderbolt, and fell dead on the river Eridanus. Even the firmest believers of Hyginus find the attribution of the tale to Hesiod hard to accept. A fragment from Hesiod very possibly connects Eridanus to amber. it is uncertain, but possible, that the fragment also connected Eridanus and amber to the tears of the Heliades; what is certain however is that Hesiod was not connecting Eridanus, amber and perhaps the Heliades, to the myth of Phaethon.

=== The tragic poets ===
A now-lost tragedy by Aeschylus, titled &quot;Heliades&quot; (&quot;daughters of the Sun&quot;) was written covering the subject of this myth. Very little of this play survives now, and the form of the myth as assumed by Aeschylus is impossible to know. It would seem that in Aeschylus&#x27; play, the sisters played a significant role; two of the surviving fragments (F 71 and F 72) focus on grief, mourning, and lamentation. He seems to have transferred the location of Phaethon&#x27;s fall in Iberia, west of Italy.

By contrast, Euripides&#x27; version of the story, the now lost tragedy &quot;Phaethon&quot;, while similarly fragmentary, is much better preserved, with twelve fragments surviving covering some 400 lines of text. According to the summary of the play, Phaethon is the son of Helios by an Oceanid named Clymene, who nonetheless hid the boy&#x27;s true parentage and claimed he had been fathered by her nominal husband Merops, the king of Aethiopia (Merops and Clymene are an interesting swap of the names in Hyginus&#x27; Hesiodic version, Merope and Clymenus). The main conflict of the play is the upcoming marriage of an unwilling Phaethon.

The identity of the bride seems to be this fragmentary play&#x27;s greatest mystery. Euripides seems to have made Aphrodite the bride of the unfortunate youth; if that is the case, then it would seem that Euripides combined the stories of two Phaethons, that of the son of Helios who drove his father&#x27;s car and died, and that of Phaethon the son of Helios&#x27; sister Eos whom Aphrodite abducted to be a watchman of her shrines, and whom late antiquity writers described as a lover of the goddess, as suggested by Wilamowitz. Another explanation on how Phaethon could possibly be marrying the goddess of beauty is that Aphrodite had planned Phaethon&#x27;s destruction from the very beginning, as revenge against his father for revealing to Hephaestus, her husband, the goddess&#x27; affair with Ares, the god of war. Henri Weil suggested that Phaethon is to marry one of the Heliades, and James Diggle, while deeming this suggestion unprovable, is convinced of it being the case.

Clymene reveals her son his true parentage, perhaps to help him overcome his reluctance to get married. Although doubtful at first, his mother&#x27;s words convince him and agrees to travel east to find his divine father and have his parentage confirmed. What happens next is that someone, perhaps a &quot;paedagogus&quot;, arrives in the scene to inform the audience of Phaethon&#x27;s disastrous ride. According to his account, Helios actually escorted his son on his doomed journey, riding on a horse named Sirius next to him and shouting instructions and advice on how to drive the car, an element not found in subsequent treatments of the myth.

Surviving fragments do not clearly paint Zeus as the culprit of Phaethon&#x27;s death; but next Clymene orders slave girls to hide Phaethon&#x27;s smoking body from Merops (who is still unaware both of Phaethon&#x27;s true parentage as well as his fiery death), pointing to Zeus having indeed played a role in the boy&#x27;s death. Merops discovers his son&#x27;s charred corpse, and the truth, a bit later.

The only other tragedy about the myth is Theodorides&#x27; now lost &quot;Phaethon&quot;, performed in 363 BC at the Lenaea festival, nothing of which survives to us.

=== References to the myth of Phaethon ===
With Aeschylus being the earliest (as far as it can be determined) that Phaethon&#x27;s story would have been known, the next mention possibly came from a lost work of Philoxenus of Cythera (435~434 – 380~379 BC), a dithyrambic poet. Pliny the Elder mentions him second (after Aeschylus) among the authors who spoke of the myth of the Sun god&#x27;s son. Pliny also names Nicander and Satyrus as other authors who knew of Phaethon.

==== Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; ====
In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;, Critias tells the story of Atlantis as recounted to Solon by an Egyptian priest, who prefaced the story by saying:

There have been, and will be again, many destructions of mankind arising out of many causes; the greatest have been brought about by the agencies of fire and water, and other lesser ones by innumerable other causes. There is a story that even you [Greeks] have preserved, that once upon a time, Phaethon, the son of Helios, having yoked the steeds in his father&#x27;s chariot, because he was not able to drive them in the path of his father, burnt up all that was upon the earth, and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt. Now, this has the form of a myth, but really signifies a declination of the bodies moving in the heavens around the Earth, and a great conflagration of things upon the Earth, which recurs after long intervals.

==== Palaphaetus&#x27; &quot;On Unbelievable Tales&quot;====
Like other authors of around this period, Palaephatus&#x27;s version is not too rich in details. Naming no mother, Palaphaetus speaks of Phaethon as a son of Helios who had the irrational desire to drive his father&#x27;s chariot, but had no knowledge of how to handle the reins. Unable to keep balance he was swept off course by the wild horses and drowned into the Eridanus river. Unlike several other retellings, a party behind Phaethon&#x27;s death is not named, as Zeus takes no action to stop Phaethon and save the Earth.

==== Apollonius Rhodius&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot; ====
While sailing up the Eridanus river on their way back, the Argonauts reach the outfall of the deep lake where Phaethon fell after he was struck with a lightning bolt. During the day, the crew of the Argo was tormented by the nauseating stench from Phaethon&#x27;s corpse, still smoldering after all this time, and at night they had to listen to the lament of his sisters, now turned into poplar trees and shedding tears of amber.

==== Diodorus Siculus&#x27; &quot;Historic Library&quot; ====
Phaethon, the son of Helios, while still a youth persuaded his father to retire for a single day and give to him his chariot. His father eventually yielded to his son&#x27;s wishes, and gave him his quadriga. The boy was unable to control the reins, and the horses left their accustomed course, setting ablaze the Heavens (creating the Milky Way) and the Earth (creating uninhabitable land) alike. Zeus, seeing the catastrophe, smote Phaethon with a thunderbolt and brought the Sun to its course. Phaethon fell into the Eridanus river, dead. His sisters mourned him, and turned into black poplar trees.

=== Ovid ===
The influence of Euripides&#x27; lost play can be easily recognized in Ovid&#x27;s own version of the myth. Another possible inspiration of Ovid&#x27;s version might have been Nicander, who is known to have written about Phaethon in some work, perhaps attested in the lost &quot;Heteroeumena&quot; (loosely translating into &quot;transformations&quot;). In the version of the myth told by Ovid, Phaethon is the son of Clymene and Phoebus Apollo, and Phaethon would often boast about being the son of the sun-god. Phaethon, challenged by Epaphus and his playmates, sought assurance from his mother that his father was truly Apollo. She gave him the requested assurance and told him to turn to his father for confirmation. He asked his father for some proof that would demonstrate his relationship with the Sun. When the god swore by the river Styx to grant him whatever he wanted, he insisted on being allowed to drive the Sun chariot for a day. Apollo tried to talk him out of it by telling him that not even Jupiter (the king of the gods) would dare to drive it, as the chariot was fiery hot and the horses breathed out flames. He said:

The first part of the track is steep, and one that my fresh horses at dawn can hardly climb. In mid-heaven it is highest, where to look down on earth and sea often alarms even me and makes my heart tremble with awesome fear. The last part of the track is downwards and needs sure control. Then even Tethys herself, who receives me in her submissive waves, is accustomed to fear that I might dive headlong. Moreover, the rushing sky is constantly turning, and drags along the remote stars, and whirls them in rapid orbits. I move the opposite way, and its momentum does not overcome me as it does all other things, and I ride contrary to its swift rotation. Suppose you are given the chariot. What will you do? Will you be able to counter the turning poles so that the swiftness of the skies does not carry you away? Perhaps you conceive in imagination that there are groves there and cities of the gods and temples with rich gifts. The way runs through the ambush, and apparitions of wild beasts! Even if you keep your course, and do not steer awry, you must still avoid the horns of Taurus the Bull, Sagittarius the Haemonian Archer, raging Leo and Lion&#x27;s jaw, Scorpio&#x27;s cruel pincers sweeping out to encircle you from one side, and Cancer&#x27;s crab-claws reaching out from the other. You will not easily rule those proud horses, breathing out through mouth and nostrils the fires burning in their chests. They scarcely tolerate my control when their fierce spirits are hot, and their necks resist the reins. Beware, my boy, that I am not the source of a gift fatal to you, while something can still be done to set right your request!
Phaethon, however, was adamant, and thus Apollo was forced to relent. When the day came, the fierce horses that drew the chariot felt that it was empty because of the lack of the sun-god&#x27;s weight and went out of control. Terrified, Phaethon dropped the reins. The horses veered from their course, scorching the Earth, burning the vegetation, bringing the blood of the Ethiopians to the surface of their skin and so turning it black, changing much of Africa into a desert, drying up rivers and lakes and shrinking the sea. Earth cried out to Jupiter who was forced to intervene by striking Phaethon with a lightning bolt. Like a falling star, Phaethon plunged blazing into the river Eridanus.

The epitaph on his tomb was:
Here Phaethon lies who in the sun-god&#x27;s chariot fared. And though greatly he failed, more greatly he dared.

Apollo, stricken with grief at his son&#x27;s death, at first refused to resume his work of driving his chariot, but at the appeal of the other gods, including Jupiter who used threats, returned to his task.

The detail of Phaethon questioning the parentage he otherwise took pride in being the result of Epaphus&#x27; words is also present in the works of Servius, who wrote that Epaphus, now presented as the succeeded king of Egypt, mocked Phaethon for being born out of adultery; the outcome is largely the same, as Phaethon travels east to meet his father, gets Helios to promise him any favor, and then drives the chariot with disastrous results.

=== Other late authors ===
Philostratus of Lemnos, who follows the typical premise of Phaethon&#x27;s tale (son of Helios who asks his father to drive his chariot and ends up burning the Earth) describes in great detail the extent of the catastrophe, putting more detail in the picture and the visual representation rather than the action; Night drives away Day from the noonday sky, the Sun&#x27;s orb plunges into the Earth pulling the stars along with him, the Seasons abandon their posts in fear, and Earth raises her hands in supplication as she burns. Ultimately, Phaethon falls from the chariot, on fire, and dies. The Eridanus mourns him along with the Heliades.
According to Clement of Alexandria &quot;... in the time of Crotopus occurred the burning of Phaethon, and the deluges of Deucalion&quot;. In &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot;, Suetonius attributes to the emperor Tiberius the following repeated remark about the future emperor Caligula: &quot;That to allow Gaius to live would prove the ruin of himself and of all men, and that he was raising a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world&quot;.

A scholiast on Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; provides a different parentage for Phaethon, making him the son of Helios and Rhodos instead (thus full brother to the Heliadae), here the daughter of Asopus, the river god. The scholiast follows the version of Phaethon being raised by his mother; when he learns the truth, he seeks out Helios and asks him to drive his chariot. Helios allows him not due to some promise or vow he made to his son, but rather because of his son&#x27;s persistence, despite knowing what would follow. According to other authors, Zeus strikes him with a thunderbolt. The element of Helios knowing what&#x27;s in store for his child, but being unable to thwart it, is present in several tellings; Statius writes that &quot;with tears did he warn the rejoicing youth of treacherous stars and zones that would fain not be o&#x27;errun and the temperate heat that lies midway between the poles; obedient was he and cautious, but he cruel Parcae would not suffer him to learn.&quot;

Valerius Flaccus gives attention to the wrecked chariot itself, and how Tethys, who is Phaethon&#x27;s grandmother as well as the goddess who receives Helios in the western ocean as he sets, picks up the fragments of yoke and axle, and one of the horses too (Pyrois) who is fearful of a father&#x27;s wrath.

Cicero, another Roman author, describes Sol as being &quot;tricked&quot; into letting his son drive his chariot, expressing surprise and disbelief that a god could be deceived like that.

Seneca speaks of Phaethon, the &quot;youth who dared drive the everlasting chariot, heedless of his father&#x27;s goal.&quot;

=== Phaethon as a legitimate offspring ===
Hyginus wrote that Phaethon, son of Helios / Sol and Clymene, secretly mounted his father&#x27;s car without said father&#x27;s knowledge and leave, but with the aid of his sisters the Heliades who yoked the horses. Being inexperienced, Phaethon drove the chariot too high, and it was fear that made him plunge into the Eridanus; when Zeus struck him with a thunderbolt, the Earth began to burn. Zeus then, pretending to want to put out the fire, let loose all the rivers everywhere, causing the flood that drowned everyone except for Deucalion and Pyrrha. Phaethon secretly stealing the chariot, and his sisters helping him out perhaps implies the existence of an early version, where Phaethon and his (full) sisters are legitimate offspring of the Sun god and his wife, brought up in their father&#x27;s house, rather than product(s) of an extramarital liaison. After his death, Phaethon was conveyed to the stars by his father as a constellation. The constellation associated with Phaethon was the Auriga, or the Charioteer.

The satirical author Lucian of Samosata treated the myth in a comedic matter in his &quot;Dialogues of the Gods&quot;. In the short dialogue, Zeus angrily berates Helios for letting his inexperienced son drive his chariot, which almost resulted in the world being destroyed. Helios acknowledges his error, but claims he was pressured by Phaethon and Phaethon&#x27;s mother Clymene both (another implication of the union between Helios and the mother of Phaethon being &quot;marital&quot; in nature, not an affair, and thus making their child legitimate), and could have not foreseen the extent of the disaster. Zeus is displeased to hear it, unconvinced that he would not know that an inexperienced driver like Phaethon would not be able to control the steeds. Helios then asks Zeus to be merciful, as his son has already been punished (being dead) and he himself is in great mourning. Zeus disagrees that this punishment is enough, returns Helios his damaged chariot which is in need of repair, and threatens to strike him with one of his thunderbolts should he ever do such thing again. In &quot;True History&quot;, another work of Lucian&#x27;s, Phaethon is the king of the Sun and is at war with the Moon, ruled by King Endymion.

Nonnus&#x27; late version of the story is one of the two extensive narratives to survive, the other being Ovid&#x27;s. Unlike other versions, Nonnus&#x27; is one of the few where Phaethon is a legitimate offspring of a married couple, with his motivation shifting from need to prove his parentage to him wanting to imitate his idolized father. In Nonnus&#x27; account, found in his epic &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, Hermes tells Dionysus the tragic story of Phaethon. Helios and the beautiful nymph Clymene fall in love and get married with her father Oceanus&#x27; blessing, and together they have Phaethon. Phaethon is raised by his parents, in the company of Oceanus and the Oceanid nymphs. As a boy, he would mimic his father and his daily journey by driving a wagon of his own design, with burning torches standing in for the fire. When he grows up, he begs his father to let him drive his chariot, but Helios refuses, arguing that sons are not necessarily fit to follow on their fathers&#x27; footsteps (bringing up how Ares, Hephaestus, Apollo and Hermes do not hold lightning bolts like their father Zeus does). Phaethon nevertheless is not a bit discouraged by his worried father&#x27;s words, and then pressures him more, as does Clymene; with great reluctance, Helios consents, and gives his son a very extensive and detailed speech about all the dangers and the hazards of the ride. He then dresses Phaethon up in his own robes, helmet and solar crown and gives him the reins. With a final warning from his father, Phaethon yokes the horses and ascends in the sky, as his mother Clymene cheerfully waves him goodbye, still unaware of the danger that awaits her son. Like in all other versions, his ride is a disaster, as he burns the Earth. Zeus then kills him with a lightning bolt, and places him among the stars as the constellation Auriga, the charioteer of the heavens. Nonnus&#x27;s version of the events is similar to that of Lucian, as both make (or imply) Clymene a wife to Helios, their son Phaethon born in marriage, and Clymene is actively present in persuading Helios to let their son drive the chariot.

=== Mourning for Phaethon ===
==== The mournful sisters ====
A very common element of the story is that Phaethon&#x27;s sisters, the Heliades, mourn his death by the river and transform into black poplars, shedding tears of amber for their lost brother. According to Pliny the Elder, it was Aeschylus who introduced the transformation of the sisters into poplar trees. Their number and names vary; a scholiast on Homer gives an alternative parentage where Phaethon and his three sisters (Phaethusa, Lampetia and Aegle) are the children of Helios and Rhodos, here the daughter of Asopus. Hyginus names seven; Merope, Helie, Aegle, Lampetia, Phoebe, Aetherie and Dioxippe. Ovid has at least three, but only two (Phaethusa and Lampetia) are named. Servius only mentions Phaethusa and Lampetia.

Although the Heliades&#x27; role and fate in the myth is not mentioned in any of the surviving fragments of &quot;Phaethon&quot;, Euripides briefly brings up the Heliades and their shedding of amber tears for their brother by the Eridanus in another play, &quot;Hippolytus&quot;.

Ovid vividly describes the sisters cry and mourn for their brother by the banks of the Eridanus for four months unmoving. Then, as they try to move, find themselves rooted to the ground, unable to leave. Their mother Clymene finds them, and although she tries to free her daughters by breaking off the forming branches and snapping the barks, she is unable to help them and the metamorphosis is completed.

The &quot;Odyssey&quot; scholiast writes that Zeus, feeling pity for them, changed them into the amber-crying poplar trees, and allowing them to retain the memories of their old lives and sorrows.

According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, it was Helios who turned them into trees, for their honor to Phaethon, and Hyginus wrote that they were transformed into trees for yoking the chariot without their father&#x27;s consent.

The part concerning the Heliades might have been a mythical device to account for the origin of amber; it is probably of no coincidence that the Greek word for amber, &quot;elektron&quot; (), resembles &quot;elektor&quot; (), an epithet of Helios. The poplar tree was considered sacred to Helios, due to the sun-like brilliance its shining leaves have.

==== The mournful lover ====
Later authors, particularly the Romans, mention the story of Cycnus, a man who was Phaethon&#x27;s lover and deeply mourned his death and was turned into a swan, birds who are known for mourning the loss of their mates for days. In Ovid&#x27;s account, the gods turned the inconsolable Cycnus into a swan soon after Phaethon&#x27;s own death; even as a swan he retained memories of Phaethon&#x27;s fiery demise, and the bird would thereafter avoid the sun&#x27;s heat. Virgil instead writes that Cycnus mourned for Phaethon well into his old age, thereupon he was turned into a swan, his white hair becoming the bird&#x27;s white feathers upon transformation. Pausanias and Servius explicitly name Apollo as the god who turned Cycnus into a swan, after having blessed him with talent in singing at some time before; Apollo then placed him among the stars, as the constellation Cygnus, &quot;the swan&quot;. Cycnus&#x27; profession as a musician seems to be a direct reference to the swan song swans are famous for.

=== Artistic evidence ===
On one of the earliest extant artistic attestations of the myth, a cast taken from an Arretine mould now housed in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Phaethon is shown fallen from the car, a wheel lying next to him while another is being collected by the water goddess Tethys, his grandmother, as Valerius Flaccus wrote. The god behind Phaethon&#x27;s death, Zeus, is seen hurling his thunderbolt, while Helios appears on horse-back, with a spare horse by his side (matching Euripides&#x27; telling where Helios accompanies his son in the sky), having caught two of the horses and now directing his attention to the other two (like Lucretius describes him doing). Artemis is there too, perhaps alluding to some obscure version where she played a role in the story, as is Iris, the rainbow and messenger goddess. Another figure, perhaps Isis, is also present. An Apulian crater of c. 360-350 has a scene with named characters Merops, Clymene and Melanippus (TrGF adesp . 5f).

The myth of father and son was immortalized in Corinth (where Helios had a significant cult), where Pausanias describes two gilded chariots, one carrying Phaethon the other Helios, adorning a gateaway near Corinth&#x27;s market:

On leaving the market-place along the road to Lechaeum you come to a gateway, on which are two gilded chariots, one carrying Phaethon the son of Helius (Sun), the other Helius himself.
=== Connections ===
The lesser-known myth of Sirius the dog star god and the harvest goddess Opora share some elements with the myth of Phaethon. In that myth, Sirius visits the earth on some mission but then meets and falls in love with Opora. His unfulfilled love makes him burn hotter, which results in the humans suffering under the great heat he causes. They pray to the gods, and eventually Boreas the god of the north wind orders his sons to deliver Opora to Sirius while he uses cold wind blasts to cool the earth. To commemorate the event, Sirius would continue to burn hot each year during the harvest season, explaining the intense heat of the dog-days of summer, attributed to Sirius by the ancients. In addition, some ancient authors used &#x27;Sirius&#x27; (meaning &quot;scorching&quot;) as an epithet for Helios himself.

Phaethon&#x27;s story shares some similarities to the myth of Asclepius, as mortal sons of divine fathers (Helios and Apollo) who disrupted natural order (Phaethon by driving the chariot off-course, Asclepius by resurrecting the dead) and were then killed by Zeus in order to establish that order again after complains from other divinities (Gaia and Hades), bringing sorrow to said fathers. Phaethon&#x27;s myth was the preeminent myth involving amber in classical antiquity, and according to Celtic tradition, Apollo shed tears of amber for Asclepius&#x27; death; while Apollo&#x27;s association with amber is not extraordinary, the context of it (mourning for his son) is significant. Diodorus Siculus in his own account of Phaethon ended by saying that amber was commonly used in connection to mourning the death of young people, and the link between resin and tears was not an uncommon one, as seen in the myths of Myrrha and Meleager (according to a lost play by Sophocles); the ancient Greek word for tear &quot;dakruon&quot; could also mean sap or gum. The first of the Vatican Mythographers tried to merge the two myths, writing that Phaethon brought Hippolytus back to life (Asclepius in myth), and that after he was killed by Zeus, Apollo slew the Sicilian smiths who forged Zeus&#x27; thunderbolts (Apollo slaying the Cyclopes who forged Zeus&#x27; lightning bolts after he slew Asclepius). The second narrative on Phaethon however, from the so-dubbed &quot;Second Vatican Mythographer&quot;, recounts the more traditional version of the myth with no traces of amalgamation with other myths or any connection to Asclepius.

* Donald Cotton wrote a comedy radio play &quot;The Tragedy of Phaethon&quot; broadcast on BBC Network 3, 10 February 1965.
* Angus Wilson’s novel Setting the World on Fire (1980) opens with the description of a Phaethon painting which proves pivotal to the protagonist&#x27;s emerging self-conception, leading up to his production of Lully’s &quot;Phaëton.&quot;
* John C. Wright&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Oecumene&quot; trilogy (2002) features a protagonist named Phaethon, whose father&#x27;s name is Helion. Mythical references abound.
* In 2002, Volkswagen introduced the VW Phaeton.
* In 2012, former Disco Inferno frontman Ian Crause adapted the story of Phaethon as &quot;The Song of Phaethon&quot; for his first musical release in over a decade. Crause used the story as an analogy for Britain&#x27;s entry into the Second Gulf War.
* In 2016, Taffety Punk Theatre premiered Michael Milligan&#x27;s play &quot;Phaeton&quot; in Washington, DC.
* In 2019, Carl Rütti set to music an early modern interpretation of Sebastian Brant&#x27;s Phaethon story, which equates the fall of Phaethon with a solar eclipse, but has Phaethon survive and return triumphant. Two versions exist for male choir and mixed choir, the latter as part of Rütti&#x27;s four-part solar eclipse cantata &quot;Eklipsis&quot;.

== Shared name ==
The name &quot;Phaethon&quot;, which means &quot;Shining One&quot;, was given also to Phaethon of Syria, to one of the horses of Eos (the Dawn), the Sun, the constellation Auriga, and the planet Jupiter, while as an adjective it was used to describe the sun and the moon. In some accounts the planet referred to by this name is not Jupiter but Saturn.

When 1 Ceres and 2 Pallas – the first asteroids – were discovered, astronomer Heinrich Olbers suggested that they were fragments of a much larger hypothetical planet, which was later named &quot;Phaethon&quot;. However, the &#x27;Phaeton hypothesis&#x27; has been superseded by the accretion model, in which the asteroid belt represented the remainder of the protoplanetary disk that never formed a planet, due to the interference of the gravity of Jupiter. However, fringe theorists still consider the Phaeton hypothesis likely.

In modern times, an asteroid whose orbit brings it close to the Sun has been named &quot;3200 Phaethon&quot; after the mythological Phaethon.

The French form of the name &quot;Phaethon&quot; is &quot;Phaéton&quot;. This form of the word is applied to a kind of carriage and automobile.

An order, family, and genus of birds bear the name Phaethon in their taxonomic nomenclature, the tropicbirds.

<text>Lemmer () is a town in the municipality of De Fryske Marren, in the Dutch province of Friesland. Lemmer lies adjacent to the IJsselmeer and the Frisian Lakes and is one of Friesland&#x27;s best-known surface water sports locations. Lemmer is a bustling lakeside resort in the summer months and attracts not only day-trippers from surrounding communities such as Emmeloord, Urk, and Joure, but also national and international tourists.

In 2017 the town had 10,225 inhabitants. Residents of Lemmer are called &quot;Lemsters&quot;. Due to its favorable location in relation to the Randstad, Lemmer attracts many new inhabitants from outside Friesland. As a result, the village has suffered little from the effects of rural flight. The hamlet of Brekkenpolder also belongs to the town, along with most of the hamlet of Tacozijl and a small part of the hamlet of Westend.

==History==
The original &quot;Lemsters&quot; settled where the rivers Rien and Zijlroede meet, though it remains unknown when they first did so. Lemmer appears in writing at the beginning of the fourteenth century, though it is mentioned as &quot;Lenna&quot; in the writings of the bishop of the diocese of Utrecht in 1228. A further link can probably be made with the name &quot;Lammerbroeke&quot;, which appears in 1165 as an earlier form of Lemsterhoek, a hamlet just west of present-day Lemmer, which was destroyed by the Hollanders around 1400. No rebuilding ensued, but the place and name are still known, especially among sailors and fishermen. Even older names have also survived, such as &quot;Lyamer&quot;.

Gradually, a settlement grew at the mouth of these inland waterways of the Zuiderzee, a prime place for merchants and artisans.

Lemmer was in a vulnerable position on the Zuiderzee and often fell under the influence of Holland. That happened in 1197, among other times, when Count William I had a castle built in Oosterzee to aid in his subjugation of the lord of Kuinre. In 1422, a castle was built in Lemmer by Duke John III of Bavaria-Straubing, who had been summoned by the Schieringers as patron of Friesland. Known as John &quot;the Pitiless&quot;, he certainly would not have been a popular figure in Lemmer.

Duke Charles II of Guelders also interfered with Friesland. He had a blockhouse built in Lemmer in 1521, which housed a garrison. Two years later he handed it over to the Burgundians. What the castles and blockhouse looked like is unknown.

The Spaniards did not leave the village alone either. In 1581, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, they conquered Lemmer, along with the city of Sloten. In the &quot;rampjaar&quot; of 1672, however, Prince-Bishop von Galen of Münster proved unable to occupy Lemmer as part of the Franco-Dutch War.

In 1799, British troops landed in Lemmer. The War of the Second Coalition had broken out between Great Britain and France, and the Dutch had become involved as &quot;sister republic&quot;. British warships sailed the Zuiderzee and the cities of Enkhuizen, Medemblik and Stavoren were occupied. Soon afterwards, the large warships could be seen in Lemmer. The Lemster &quot;beurtman&quot;, with whom the enterprising Poppe Jans had made many a trip to Amsterdam, was overpowered near Urk and its passengers taken to Stavoren. Two British warships appeared in front of the port of Lemmer on 24 September. Captain James Boorder landed in a sloop - under cover of a white flag - to meet local authorities. A sudden storm forced him to spend the night at &quot;De Wildeman&quot; Inn. Three days later, he returned and claimed Lemmer for the British, including all ships and cargo. If refused, all of Lemmer would be shot to pieces.

Lemmer rejected their demand fearlessly. It had since been reinforced by 500 armed farmers from Het Bildt, who brought field guns with them. But the town could not withstand the fire of British fourteen, sixteen and eighteen-pound shots. An hour and a half after the attack was started, the flag was raised on the church tower as a sign of surrender. In various places in Friesland, patriots called for civilians and soldiers to liberate Lemmer. On 7 October, there were still 260 soldiers and marines in the town. To prevent an attack by water, they had used chains to block waterways.

Lemmer eventually became one of the most important fishing towns in the Netherlands, thanks in part to its fleet of 146 vessels. With the completion of the Zuiderzee Works between 1924 and 1968, fishery declined incrementally. Lemmer offers a central position in southern Friesland and northern Flevoland. Every year there is the &quot;Lemsterweek&quot;, a week of cultural events attracting around 85,000 people annually. The &quot;Lemsteraak&quot;, a traditional sailing ship, originates in Lemmer. &quot;De Groene Draeck&quot;, the royal yacht of Princess Beatrix, is a notable example of a &quot;Lemsteraak&quot;.

<text>Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Maglica (Croatian: &quot; Ante Maglica&quot;) (born 1930) is the owner and founder of Mag Instrument Inc, the company that manufactures the Maglite flashlight which was designed by Maglica. The Maglite is a powerful and durable flashlight that has become standard issue gear used by police officers in the USA.

==Early life==
Although born in New York City, Maglica grew up on the island of Zlarin, which is off the coast of Croatia. During the Great Depression, his family returned to their homeland. World War II ravaged Croatia, and in 1950 he returned to the United States, settling in Ontario, California. Speaking little English, he obtained work as a machinist. While working there, he learned that one of his bosses operated a side business machining hydraulic parts. Tony learned of a metal lathe for sale for $1000 and convinced the seller to accept a $125 deposit, most of his money at the time, with the remainder being paid off with monthly payments.

That business grew into his own machine shop which he incorporated in 1974 called Mag Instrument Inc. Here he met Claire Halasz, his future partner in life and in business, when he hired her to decorate his machine shop. Although they didn&#x27;t marry, Claire would eventually reside with him and take his surname. She had two sons, Stephen and Christopher, and one daughter, Jackie, who would come to know Tony as their stepfather.

==Family Affairs==
As the Maglite became popular and the company grew, Mag Instruments Inc. became a family operated company with Tony as President, Claire operating the marketing, personnel and purchasing departments, and Claire&#x27;s sons, Stephen and Christopher Halasz, holding positions in the company as Vice President and Director of Research and Development, respectively.

In 1992 though, there was a shakeup at the company when Claire discovered that Tony had been arranging to leave the company to his children from a previous marriage upon his death. This started a bitter family battle that would last over a decade and result in Claire and her sons leaving the company, Claire filing a palimony lawsuit against Tony for $200 million, and Claire&#x27;s sons starting their own flashlight company in 1997.

===Palimony lawsuit===
In 1992, after learning of Maglica&#x27;s business plans, their relationship ended and Claire filed a palimony suit for, among other things, breach of contract, breach of partnership agreement, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and quantum meruit in Orange County Superior Court seeking $200 million in damages. The lawsuit went to jury trial, covered by Court TV to large and involved audiences, awarded Claire $84 million in the Spring of 1994.

The judgment was appealed to the California Courts of Appeal where, in 1998, was reversed and remanded. The court stated that the award was incorrect because the damages should have been the value of her services, not the amount of the benefit of her services. After being remanded and requiring a new trial, Claire settled with Mag Instrument Inc in 2000 for $29 million.

===Claire&#x27;s sons and Bison Sportslights, Inc.===
Claire&#x27;s sons, Stephen and Christopher Halasz, were eventually forced to leave their positions at Mag Instrument, Inc. due to the souring relationship with Tony Maglica. In 1997, the brothers founded Bison Sportslights Inc in Denver, Colorado, seeking to remedy the problem of the &quot;flashlight blackhole&quot;; the dark area at the center of lens adjustable flashlights. The brothers released a product that demonstrated some efficacy to the problem, but were sued in 2002 by Mag Instrument Inc in &quot;Mag Instrument Inc. v. Bison Sportslights Inc et al. Central District Court of California, Case # CV-023187&quot; for stealing trade secrets learned while working at Mag Instrument, Inc. and trying to poach employees.

Bison Sportslights, Inc. were found liable for willful and malicious misappropriation of trade secrets, malicious breach of confidence, malicious false advertising, and malicious unfair competition. Bison had a permanent injunction entered against it and Mag Instrument, Inc. was awarded $1.2 million for damages and attorney&#x27;s fees.

Bison Sportslights, Inc. is no longer in business.

<text>X Corps was a corps of the United States Army in World War II and the Korean War.

==World War II==

The X Corps was activated in May 1942 at Sherman, Texas. Elements of the corps embarked aboard &quot;Klipfontein&quot;, a Dutch ship operating under charter through the War Shipping Administration for the Army. The ship departed the San Francisco Port of Embarkation for the Pacific Theater 14 July 1944 after two changes of station and participation in maneuvers in Louisiana and at the California-Arizona maneuver area.

X Corps took part in the following campaigns: New Guinea, Leyte, and Southern Philippines.

As part of the Sixth Army, X Corps took part in the Philippines campaign of 1944–45, beginning with the invasion of Leyte. For its involvement, the X Corps received the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation with a streamer embroidered 17 October 1944 – 4 July 1945.

X Corps became inactive in 1946.

==Korean War==
===Inchon landing===

During the Korean War, it took part in Operation Chromite, the landings at Inchon, where it had the 1st Marine Division, the 7th Infantry Division and other US Army units under its command. The embryonic planning group for Chromite originally was known to insiders as &quot;Force X&quot; and the entire scheme was cloaked in absolute secrecy; to outsiders, the small planning staff was known only as the Special Planning Staff of general headquarters, Far East Command. As the organization grew, due to bureaucratic entanglements, supply orders were rejected because &quot;Force X&quot; was not referenced as a proper organization anywhere in Army manuals. General of the Army Douglas MacArthur (Supreme Commander Allied Powers) asked his chief of staff, Major General Edward Almond, to suggest a new name. Force X&#x27;s Roman numeral ten reminded Almond of a corps which had fought under MacArthur in the last war—&quot;why not call it the X Corps?&quot; he asked. MacArthur was delighted and approved of the name. General Almond was subsequently chosen by MacArthur as X Corps&#x27; new commander.

The Marines first captured an island offshore of Inchon as a prelude to the assault and at the next tide, the main attack went in. Despite the noise of the attack on the offshore island, it completely surprised the North Korean Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) forces. The Marines then moved on to the capital city of Seoul; in heavy fighting they eventually drove out the KPA defenders. The US Army&#x27;s 7th Infantry Division, which had landed later at Inchon, engaged the enemy on the outskirts of Seoul, destroying an armored regiment.

===Operations in northeast Korea (October–December 1950)===
After the landing at Inchon, X Corps attacked up the Korean peninsula on the left flank of Eighth Army. However, in early October it was withdrawn to prepare for another amphibious assault, this time at Wonsan on the eastern coast. This action proved to be a mistake as Republic of Korea Army (ROK) forces moving by land captured Wonsan on 11 October before the X Corps assault went in. The Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) entered the war on the side of North Korea, making their first attacks in late October.

After an administrative landing at Wonsan on 26 October, X Corps, now including the US 3rd Infantry Division, advanced inland northwest towards the Yalu River with the ROK I Corps made up of two ROK Divisions in the far north or right flank. The US 7th Infantry Division was in the center and the US 1st Marine Division on the southern or left flank of the X Corps attack. The 3rd Infantry Division was initially in reserve. As elements of ROK I Corps and 7th Infantry Division closed on the Manchurian border, the 1st Marine Division moved into the Chosin Reservoir (Changjin Ho). The Marines were on both left and right sides of the Changjin reservoir. Regimental Combat Team 31 (RCT 31 also known as Task Force Maclean/Task Force Faith) of the 7th Infantry Division replaced the 5th Marine Regiment on the east side of the reservoir in a piecemeal fashion with only two of its three maneuver battalions in place before heavy engagement with the enemy commenced. X Corps was strung out along many miles in sub-freezing temperatures with the ROK troops and the 7th Infantry Division to the north in contact with PVA forces. RCT 31 was too far from its parent Division for support and without organic tank support and its third maneuver element; it was decimated by the onslaught of the PVA. The 1st Marine Division fared better and with remnants of RCT 31, Army Engineers and X Corps support personnel, began its move to the sea moving through elements of the 3rd Infantry Division (Task Force Dog from the 7th Infantry Regiment, and a reinforced battalion of the 65th Infantry Regiment) who provided flank and rear guard cover for the withdrawing units. The 7th Infantry Division in the center and ROK I Corps on the right flank also began withdrawing to the Hungnam beachhead. The Marines withdrew through the 3d Infantry Division with intermittent contact with PVA forces up to Sudong. The extreme temperatures during this period caused the majority of the casualties for X Corps. The Marines managed to reach the safety of Hungnam first, where the 3rd and 7th Infantry Divisions and I ROK Corps provided perimeter defense. The Marines were evacuated by the middle of December, followed by the 7th Infantry Division, I ROK Corps and the last of the X Corps&#x27; elements. The 3d Infantry Division was last to leave the beach and evacuated on 24 December 1950.

It is widely contended that X Corps remained outside of the direct command of Eighth Army too long. X Corps reported directly to the MacArthur had been necessary for the Inchon landings and still defensible for the Wonsan attack. However, after it entered the main line, conventional military doctrine indicated that it should have been placed immediately under the command of Eighth Army. General MacArthur was accused of favoritism towards Almond, the controversial commander of X Corps, who was dual-hatted as the commander of X Corps and MacArthur&#x27;s chief of staff and his personal friend.

===Operations on the eastern front===
After the withdrawal from the northeast coast, and once its units had been reconstituted, X Corps went into the line in eastern Korea, and remained there for the rest of the war.

==Post-Korean War==
In the years following the Korean War, X Corps served as a regional headquarters, having administrative, logistical, and training responsibility for both active and Army Reserve units in the northwestern portion of the Continental United States.

X Corps was inactivated on 31 March 1968, as part of the compromise between U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara who wanted to merge the Army Reserve into the Army National Guard, and the United States Congress who wanted to maintain the Army Reserve as it then existed. Under the compromise plan, all of the combat divisions and most separate combat brigades of the Army Reserve were inactivated with a corresponding increase in the National Guard; at the same time, non-divisional combat support and combat service support units were reallocated in the Army Reserve. The fourteen area corps were inactivated; in their place, eighteen army reserve commands (&quot;ARCOMs&quot;) were established. Each ARCOM was, in turn, assigned to one of five continental U.S. armies (&quot;CONUSAs&quot;) under Continental Army Command (&quot;CONARC&quot;). The bulk of X Corps&#x27; Army Reserve units were assigned to the 124th Army Reserve Command at Fort Lawton, WA.

==In popular culture==
The US Army Tenth Corps is the name of the main field force featured in Harold Coyle&#x27;s 1993 techno-thriller &quot;The Ten Thousand&quot;. In the novel its ground combat elements are the 55th Mechanized Infantry Division, the 4th Armored Division and the 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment.

<doc id="478313" wikidata="Q493615" url="?curid=478313" title="Marker pen">
<text>A marker pen, fine liner, marking pen, felt-tip pen, felt pen, flow marker, sign pen (in South Korea), vivid (in New Zealand), flomaster (in East and South Slavic countries), texta (in Australia), sketch pen (in South Asia), koki (in South Africa) or simply marker is a pen which has its own ink source and a tip made of porous, pressed fibers such as felt.
A marker pen consists of a container (glass, aluminum or plastic) and a core of an absorbent material that holds the ink. The upper part of the marker contains the nib that was made in earlier times of a hard felt material, and a cap to prevent the marker from drying out.

Until the early 1990s, the most common solvents that were used for the ink in permanent markers were toluene and xylene. These two substances are both harmful and characterized by a very strong smell. Today, the ink is usually made on the basis of alcohols (e.g. 1-Propanol, 1-butanol, diacetone alcohol and cresols).

Markers may be waterproof, dry-erase, wet-erase (e.g. transparency markers), or permanent.

==History==
Lee Newman patented a felt-tipped marking pen in 1910. In 1926, Benjamin Paskach patented a &quot;fountain paintbrush&quot;, as he called it, which consisted of a sponge-tipped handle containing various paint colors. Markers of this sort began to be popularized with the sale of Sidney Rosenthal&#x27;s Magic Marker (1953), which consisted of a glass tube of ink with a felt wick. By 1958, use of felt-tipped markers was commonplace for a variety of applications such as lettering, labeling, and creating posters. The year 1962 brought the development of the modern fiber-tipped pen (in contrast to the marker, which generally has a thicker point) by Yukio Horie of the Tokyo Stationery Company (which later became Pentel).
In 1987 Copic Sketch markers were released, further popularising markers for professional illustration.

==Parts==
The marker reservoir, which holds the ink, is formed from polyester. The &quot;felt&quot; used for the tip is usually made of highly compressed synthetic fibers or porous ceramics. Toluol and xylol were used as solvents for the dye and are still used for the indelible ink in permanent markers. Due to their toxicity, they have often been replaced with less critical substances such as alkyl or cyclic alkylene carbonates (like propylene carbonate) in other types of markers. Water content of the ink can be up to 10%. Besides solvents and the dye itself, the ink may contain additives (e.g. nonylphenylpolyglycol ether, alkylpoly-glycol ether, fatty acid polyglycol ester, or fatty alcohol ethoxalates) and preservatives (e.g. 2-Phenylphenol and its sodium salt, 6-acetoxy-2,4-dimethyl-m-dioxane).

==Types==

===Permanent marker===

Permanent markers are porous pens that can write on surfaces such as glass, plastic, wood, metal, and stone. On most surfaces, the ink is generally resistant to rubbing and water, and can last for many years. However, on certain plastics like Teflon, polypropylene etc., the marks made by such pens are not permanent and can be erased easily. Depending on the surface and the marker used, the marks can often be removed with either vigorous scrubbing or chemicals such as acetone.

===Highlighters===
Highlighters are a form of marker used to highlight and cover over existing writing while still leaving the writing readable. They are generally produced in neon colours to allow for colour coding, as well as attract buyers to them.

===Whiteboard markers===

A whiteboard marker— or dry-erase marker— uses an erasable ink, made to be used on a slick (or matte-finished), non-porous writing surface, for temporary writing with overhead projectors, whiteboards, glass, and the like. They are designed so that the user can easily erase the marks using a damp cloth, tissue, handkerchief, baby wipe, or other easily cleaned or disposable items. Generally, people use fabrics to do so, but others use items like paper, clothing items, some even use their bare hands to wipe it clear. The erasable ink does not contain the toxic chemical compounds xylene and/or toluene as have been used in permanent markers, being less of a risk to being used as a recreational drug.

Wet-wipe markers— or wet-erase markers— are another version that are used on overhead projectors, signboards, whiteboards, and other non-porous surfaces.

===Security marker===
Special &quot;security&quot; markers, with fluorescent but otherwise invisible inks, are used for marking valuables in case of burglary. The owner of a stolen, but recovered item can be determined by using ultraviolet light to make the writing visible.

===Election marker===
Marker pens with election ink (an indelible dye and often a photosensitive agent such as silver nitrate) used to mark the finger, and especially the cuticle, of voters in elections in order to prevent electoral fraud such as double voting. The stain stays visible for a week or two and may also be used to assist in vaccinations.

===Porous point pen===
A &quot;porous point pen&quot; contains a point that is made of some porous material such as felt or ceramic. Draftsman&#x27;s pens usually have a ceramic tip since this wears well and does not broaden when pressure is applied while writing.

== Dialectal variations ==
The use of the terms &quot;marker&quot; and &quot;felt-tipped pen&quot; varies significantly among different parts of the world. This is because most English dialects contain words for particular types of marker, often generic brand names, but there are no such terms in widespread international use.

===Asia===
In some parts of India, water-based felt-tip pens are referred to as &quot;sketch pens&quot; because they are mainly used for sketching and writing on paper or cardboard. The permanent ink felt-tip markers are referred to as just &quot;markers&quot;. In Malaysia and Singapore, marker pens are simply called markers. In the Philippines, a marker is commonly referred to as a &quot;Pentel pen&quot;, regardless of brand. In Indonesia, a marker pen is referred to as &quot;Spidol&quot;. In South Korea and Japan, marker pens are referred to as &quot;sign pens&quot;, &quot;name pens&quot;, or &quot;felt pens&quot;. Also, permanent pens are also referred to as &quot;Magic&quot; (from a famous pen brand name). In Iran, felt-tip pens are referred to as &quot;Magic&quot; or &quot;Highlight&quot; regardless of its brand.

===Australia===
In Australia, the term &quot;marker&quot; usually refers only to large-tip markers, and the terms &quot;felt-tip&quot; and &quot;felt pen&quot; usually refer only to fine-tip markers. Markers in Australia are often generically called &quot;texta&quot;, after a brand name of a type of permanent marker. Some variation in naming convention occurs between the states, for example in Queensland the brand name &quot;nikko&quot; has been commonly adopted.

===New Zealand===
The generic terms for fine-tipped markers are usually &quot;felt pen&quot; ,&quot;felt tip pen&quot; or &quot;felts&quot;. Large permanent markers are called &#x27;vivids&#x27; after a popular brand sold there, the Bic Stephens Vivid

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the term &quot;Koki&quot; is used for both felt pens and markers, by South Africans, as well as the standard &quot;marker&quot;.

===Canada and United States===

In the United States, the word &quot;marker&quot; is used as well as &quot;magic marker&quot;, the latter being a genericized trademark. The word &quot;sharpie&quot; is also now used as a genericized trademark; Sharpie is a popular brand of permanent markers used for labelling. Markers are also sometimes referred to as felt-pens or felts in some parts of Canada.

<text>A permanent marker or indelible marker is a type of marker pen that is used to create permanent or semi-permanent writing on an object. 

==Description==
In general, permanent marker ink comprises a main carrier solvent, a glyceride, a pyrrolidone, a resin, and a colorant, making it water resistant. It is capable of writing on a variety of surfaces from paper to metal to stone. They come in a variety of tip sizes (ultra fine to wide), shapes (chisel point, bullet tip, and wide bristle), and colors (metallic, or ultraviolet reactive). 

Most markers have alcohol-based solvents. Other types, called paint markers, contain volatile organic compounds which evaporate to dry the ink, and are similar to spray paint. Due to solvents such as toluene and xylene often being present in permanent markers, they have a potential for abuse as a recreational drug.

The permanent marker was invented in 1952 by Sidney Rosenthal.

==Applications==
===General purpose===
Permanent markers are used for writing on metals, plastics, ceramics, wood, stone, cardboard etc. However, the mark made by them is semi-permanent on some surfaces. Most permanent marker ink can be erased from some plastic surfaces (like polypropylene and teflon) with little rubbing pressure.
They can be used on ordinary paper, but the ink tends to bleed through and become visible on the other side.

===Use in microscopy===
In addition to being used for labelling microscopy slides, permanent markers can be used to do a negative stain of a bacterial sample. This means the background is stained with the marker, but the bacteria are not. The bacteria can be seen because they are unstained (lighter) while the background is stained (darker).

==Removal==
Permanent markers are generally used on hard, non-porous surfaces, because instead of staining they form a surface layer that, despite their name, can be removed by high pressure cleaning, paint thinners, or organic solvents such as acetone, xylene, or toluene. When used indoors, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate are preferred cleaners, as their fumes are much less hazardous than toluene and xylene, the main components of paint thinner, or the longer-chain hydrocarbons found in mineral spirits. Other common non-polar solvents include benzene, turpentine and other terpenes (which constitute essential oils of many plants with strong scents), most ethers, chloroform and dichloromethane, hydrocarbon fuels, and diacetone alcohol, among many others. Many of these solvents are toxic, carcinogenic, or flammable, and should only be used with adequate ventilation.

Most brands of &quot;OLFA&quot; marker wipe off easily with acetone-free nail polish remover, the kind containing ethyl acetate, a relatively non-toxic organic solvent.

A permanent marker can also be removed by drawing over it with a dry erase marker on non-porous surfaces such as a whiteboard, as dry erase markers also contain a non-polar solvent. Most dry-erase board cleaner solutions also contain effective organic solvents like 2-butoxyethanol to remove the pigment.

==Laws==
Due to their potential to be used for vandalism, some locales, such as Florida, California, New York City, and Berwyn, Illinois, have laws against possessing permanent markers in public, and prohibit sales of them to people under age 20.

<text>William Robert Sutherland (May 10, 1936 – February 18, 2020) was an American computer scientist who was the longtime manager of three prominent research laboratories, including Sun Microsystems Laboratories (1992–1998), the Systems Science Laboratory at Xerox PARC (1975–1981), and the Computer Science Division of Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. which helped develop the ARPANET.

In these roles, Sutherland participated in creating the personal computer, the technology of advanced microprocessors, two programming languages (Smalltalk, Java), and the Internet.

Unlike traditional corporate research managers, Sutherland added individuals from fields like psychology, cognitive science, and anthropology to enhance the work of his technology staff. He also directed his scientists to take their research, like the Xerox Alto &quot;personal&quot; computer, outside of the laboratory to allow people to use it in a corporate setting and to observe their interaction with it.

In addition, Sutherland fostered a collaboration between California Institute of Technology researchers developing methods of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) for integrated circuits, namely Ivan Sutherland (Bert&#x27;s brother) and Carver Mead, and with PARC staff member Lynn Conway. With PARC resources made available by Sutherland, Mead and Conway developed a textbook and university syllabus that helped expedite the development and distribution of a technology with an effect now immeasurable.

Sutherland said that a research lab is primarily a teaching institution, &quot;teaching whatever is new so that the new can become familiar, old, and used widely.&quot;

Sutherland was born in Hastings, Nebraska, on May 10, 1936, to a father from New Zealand; his mother was from Scotland. The family moved to Wilmette, Illinois, then Scarsdale, New York, for his father&#x27;s career. Bert Sutherland graduated from Scarsdale High School, then received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), and his master&#x27;s degree and Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); his thesis advisor was Claude Shannon. During his military service in the United States Navy, he was awarded the Legion of Merit as a Carrier ASW plane commander. He was the older brother of Ivan Sutherland. Sutherland died on February 18, 2020, aged 83.

<text>Color Wonder is a product made by Crayola, primarily intended for use by younger children, in which the special clear-ink marker only appears on the Color Wonder paper. Originally made with markers and paper, Color Wonder has also made specialty products including paints, etc. The Color Wonder products debuted in 1993. Color Wonder paints and finger paints, as well as Color Wonder coloring books of popular characters such as Disney Pixar&#x27;s Cars and Disney Princess also exist.

The &#x27;magic&#x27; clear-ink products were designed so that toddlers and young children don&#x27;t stain their clothes, paint on the walls, etc. Crayola has a patent under Binney &amp; Smith relating to this kind of mess-free marking system. An applicator, such as a felt pen, uses a composition containing a colorless leuco dye that changes to color in the presence of acid. The substrate in the Color Wonder paper contains zinc ions which trigger the development of color in the dyes when the marker inks are applied. The zinc ions act as Lewis acids to drive the color-changing chemical reaction.

Crayola has also another line similar to this one marketed towards older children, called Color Explosion. It is like Color Wonder, except that instead of chemicals on paper revealing the hidden color of the marker ink, the chemicals in the marker reveal stripes, dots, and swirls of color on the page. Depending on the package you get (Fire &amp; Ice, Twisted Tropicals, etc.) the colors hidden in the paper are different. Color Explosion is also available in black and white paper.

<text>Gennady Andreyevich Zyuganov (; born 26 June 1944) is a Russian politician who has been the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and served as Member of the State Duma since 1993. He is also the Chair of the Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union (UCP-CPSU) since 2001. Zyuganov ran for President of Russia four times, most controversially in 1996, when he lost in the second round to Boris Yeltsin.

==Early life and education==
Zyuganov was born in Mymrino, a farming village in Oryol Oblast, on 26 June 1944. The son and grandson of schoolteachers, he followed in their footsteps. His father fought at the Soviet-German front of WWII and returned home with serious injuries. After graduating from a secondary school, his first job was working there for one year as a physics teacher in 1961.

In 1962, Gennady enrolled into the Department of Physics and Mathematics of the Oryol Pedagogical Institute. From 1963 to 1966, he served in a Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Intelligence unit of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. Zyuganov joined the Communist Party in 1966.

He returned to the teachers&#x27; college in 1966. Three years older than most members of his class, he was already a party member and a popular college athlete. On his return, he married his wife, Nadezhda. He completed his degree in 1969.

==CPSU career==
Zyuganov taught mathematics but soon turned to Communist Party of the Soviet Union work in Oryol Oblast, beginning in 1967. He became the First Secretary of the local Komsomol and the regional chief for ideology and propaganda. He emerged as a popular politician in the area. Among many other functions, Zyuganov organized parties and dances as a local Komsomol leader while he was rising through the ranks of the party. Zyuganov rose to be second secretary, or second in command, of the party in Oryol.

He enrolled at an elite party school in Moscow, the Academy of Social Sciences in 1978, completing his doctor nauk, a post-doctoral degree, in 1980. He then returned to Oryol to become regional party chief for ideology and propaganda until 1983. In 1983, he was given a high-level position in Moscow as an instructor in the Communist Party propaganda department.

Zyuganov emerged as a leading critic of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s &quot;perestroika&quot; and &quot;glasnost&quot; in the party&#x27;s Agitation and Propaganda division (later the Ideological division), a hotbed of opposition to reform. As the party began to crumble in the late 1980s, Zyuganov took the side of hard-liners against reforms that would ultimately culminate in the end of CPSU rule and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In May 1991, he published a fiercely critical piece on Alexander Yakovlev.

==Head of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation==
Zyuganov wrote several influential papers in the early 1990s attacking Boris Yeltsin and calling for a return to the socialism of the pre-Gorbachev days. In July 1991, he signed the &quot;A Word to the People&quot; declaration. As the Communist Party of the Soviet Union fell into disarray, Zyuganov helped form the new Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), and became one of seven secretaries of the new group&#x27;s Central Committee. In 1993, he became its chairman. Outside observers were surprised by the survival of Zyuganov&#x27;s Communist Party into the post-Soviet era.

Zyuganov emerged as post-communist Russia&#x27;s leading opposition leader. He argued that the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a decline in living standards, that economic power was left concentrated in the hands of a tiny share of the population, that violent crime increased, and that the Soviet collapse allowed ethnic groups throughout Russia to embark on campaigns, sometimes violent, to win autonomy. 

Russians who felt left behind in the new Russia emerged as Zyuganov&#x27;s supporters, including a number of workers, clerks, bureaucrats, professionals, and the elderly. As Zyuganov succeeded in combining Communist ideas with Russian nationalism, his new Communist Party of the Russian Federation joined hands with numerous other left-wing and right-wing nationalist forces, forming a common &quot;national-patriotic alliance.&quot;

In the 1993 and 1995 parliamentary elections, the newly revitalized Communist Party of the Russian Federation made a strong showing, and Zyuganov emerged as a serious challenger to President Yeltsin.

===1996 presidential campaign===

Zyuganov entered the 1996 presidential election, as the standard-bearer of the Russian Communist Party. Co-opting Russian nationalism, he attacked the infiltration of Western ideals into Russian society and portrayed Russia as a great nation that had been dismantled from within by traitors in cahoots with Western capitalists, who sought the dissolution of Soviet power to exploit Russia&#x27;s boundless resources.

Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, along with Russian oligarchs such as Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Anatoly Chubais, and others feared a Communist resurgence in Russia while witnessing Zyuganov present himself as a kinder, gentler Communist while attending the World Economic Forum at Davos in 1996. Chubais recalled, stating &quot;I saw many of my good friends, presidents of major American companies, European companies, who were simply dancing around Zyuganov, trying to catch his eye, peering at him. These were the world&#x27;s most powerful businessmen, with world famous names, who with their entire appearance demonstrated that they were seeking support of the future president of Russia, because it was clear to everyone that Zyuganov was going to be the future president of Russia, and now they needed to build a relationship with him. So, this shook me up!&quot;.

The oligarchs set aside their differences and held several private meetings in Davos hotel rooms, where they strategized how to defeat the perceived Zyuganov threat. The result was the &quot;Davos pact&quot;, an agreement between Chubais and the oligarchs that he would lead an anti-Communist campaign against Zyuganov, that they agreed to fund. The subsequent months saw a massive media offensive as &quot;money poured into advertising campaigns, into regional tours, into bribing journalists&quot;, all supported by the oligarchs who owned the major media. Yeltsin&#x27;s subsequent victory in that election can be traced back to the events that took place in Davos between Chubais and those Russian oligarchs.

In the election on 16 June, Zyuganov finished second with 32%, trailing only Yeltsin, who captured 35%. Yeltsin gained from the elimination of the many smaller parties, as well as the support of Alexander Lebed, and eventually won the two-man showdown by 53.8% against 40.7%.

It has been alleged that Yeltsin may not have legitimately won the 1996 presidential election, but instead employed electoral fraud. Some results, largely from Russia&#x27;s ethnic republics of Tatarstan, Dagestan and Bashkortostan, showed highly unlikely changes in voting patterns between the two rounds of voting. At a meeting with opposition leaders in 2012, then-president Dmitry Medvedev was reported to have said, &quot;There is hardly any doubt who won [that race]. It was not Boris Nikolaevich Yeltsin.&quot;

===After 1996 election===

After the December 1999 parliamentary elections, the number of Communist seats in the Duma was reduced. Communist support started to decline, given the widespread electoral support at the time for the government&#x27;s invasion of Chechnya in September 1999 and the popularity of Yeltsin&#x27;s new prime minister, Vladimir Putin, who was widely seen as Yeltsin&#x27;s heir apparent.

===2000 presidential campaign===

Zyuganov placed a distant second behind Vladimir Putin in the March 2000 presidential election.

===After 2000 election===

Zyuganov has additionally served as the Chairman of the Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union (UCP-CPSU) since 2001, replacing Oleg Shenin.

In November 2001, in an open letter to Putin ahead of the summit between the US and Russian presidents in the United States, Zyuganov said that Russia was betraying its national interests. &quot;It is blindly following US policy which has been characterized recently by open aggression&quot;. Zyuganov criticized Putin for his decision the previous month to close a Cuban listening post that eavesdropped on US communications and a key naval base in Vietnam, as well as Russian support for Washington using bases in former Soviet Uzbekistan and Tajikistan for its Afghan strikes. &quot;Russia&#x27;s national state and national interests may be betrayed&quot; at the upcoming summit between Putin and US President George W. Bush, Zyuganov warned.

On 23 September 2003, Zyuganov sent a deputy request to the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office and the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation, in which he demanded to initiate an administrative case against Putin as an official of category &quot;A&quot; and to fine him in the amount of 22,500 rubles for conducting election campaigning outside the campaign period of the United Russia party. However, the Chairman of the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation, Alexander Veshnyakov, and the Chairman of the Federation Council, Sergey Mironov, objected that they did not see anything illegal in the President&#x27;s speech. The head of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation tried to file a complaint with higher authorities, but not a single court examined the complaint on its merits.

In 2004, Zyuganov declined to run against Putin, who secured a landslide reelection victory.

===2008 presidential campaign===
In October 2005, Zyuganov indicated that he would run for president in 2008, making him the second person to enter the race for the Kremlin following former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov. According to one report, Zyuganov pledged to quadruple pensions and state salaries, should he be elected.

In the presidential election on 2 March 2008, Zyuganov garnered 17.76% of the vote and came in second to Medvedev&#x27;s 70.23%.

===Post-2008===
On Zyuganov&#x27;s 65th birthday in June 2009, the then Prime Minister Vladimir Putin presented him with a copy of the first Soviet edition of the Communist Manifesto. On the occasion of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin&#x27;s birthday on 21 December 2010, Zyuganov called for the re-Stalinization of Russian society in an open letter to President Medvedev.

After Putin&#x27;s annual address to parliament on 20 April 2011, Zyuganov criticised it as inadequate in dealing with Russia&#x27;s economic decline and warned that, &quot;If the [parliamentary and presidential] elections are as dirty as before, the situation will develop along the North African scenario.&quot; Zyuganov denounced election irregularities in the Russian legislative election of 2011 but also expressed his opposition to the organizers of the mass demonstrations of December 2011 who he viewed as liberals who exploited unrest.

The communist party played only a minor role in the protests, with one of its speakers, who called for restoration of Soviet power, being booed off the stage. Party rallies on 18 December 2011, in protest of election irregularities in Moscow and St. Petersburg were attended by only a few thousand, mostly elderly, party supporters. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it is questionable that Zyuganov, due to his age and association with Soviet policies, will be able to capitalize on the opportunity presented by popular disgust with the Putin regime, or mobilize mass popular support for his party.
Zyuganov is a harsh critic of President Vladimir Putin, but states that his recipes for Russia&#x27;s future are true to his Soviet roots. Zyuganov hopes to renationalise all major industries and he believes the USSR was &quot;the most humane state in human history&quot;. On 29 November 2008, in his speech before the 13th Party Congress, Zyuganov made these remarks about the state that Russia under Putin was in:

Objectively, Russia&#x27;s position remains complicated, not to say dismal. The population is dying out. Thanks to the &quot;heroic efforts&quot; of the Yeltsinites the country has lost 5 out of the 22 million square kilometers of its historical territory. Russia has lost half of its production capacity and has yet to reach the 1990 level of output. Our country is facing three mortal dangers: de-industrialization, de-population and mental debilitation. The ruling group has neither notable successes to boast of, nor a clear plan of action. All its activities are geared to a single goal: to stay in power at all costs. Until recently it has been able to keep in power due to the &quot;windfall&quot; high world prices for energy. Its social support rests on the notorious &quot;vertical power structure&quot; which is another way of saying intimidation and blackmail of the broad social strata and the handouts that power chips off the oil and gas pie and throws out to the population in crumbs, especially on the eve of elections.

The CPRF cherishes the rule of Joseph Stalin. Zyuganov and the party support social conservatism and voted in favor of the ban on the &quot;promotion of non-traditional sexual relations to minors&quot;, commonly known as the Russian gay propaganda law.

===2012 presidential campaign===

In September 2011, Zyuganov again became the CPRF&#x27;s candidate for the 2012 presidential election. According to Zyuganov, &quot;a gang of folks who cannot do anything in life apart from dollars, profits and mumbling, has humiliated the country&quot; and called for a new international alliance to &quot;counter the aggressive policies of imperialist circles.&quot;

In the 2012 Russian presidential election on 4 March 2012, Zyuganov once again came in second place by receiving 17% of the vote.

==Political views==


According to Zyuganov, Jesus Christ was the first communist, claiming that the Bible may be read through a socialist perspective.

After Russia was sanctioned for systematic doping in the run-up to the 2018 Winter Olympics, Zyuganov proposed sending Russian fans to the Games with a Soviet Victory Banner.

He is considered by Russian scholars as a neo-Eurasianist.

In August 2022, Zyuganov declared that the reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was a leader whose rule brought &quot;absolute sadness, misfortune and problems [for] all the peoples of our country&quot;.

===Ukraine===
Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the CPRF published a statement in support of the invasion and accused NATO of planning &quot;to enslave Ukraine&quot; and thus creating &quot;critical threats to the security of Russia&quot;. It called for the &quot;demilitarization and denazification&quot; of Ukraine.

The party officially supported the state-promoted narrative that Ukraine is governed by Ukrainian Banderites and &quot;neo-Nazis&quot;, who have been allegedly perpetrating genocide against Russian speakers of the separatist Donetsk and Luhansk People&#x27;s Republics, and liberating Russian forces. The CPRF also accused the United States and NATO of deploying European fascist sympathizers and Middle Eastern terrorists to Ukraine to fight the Russian army. Two members out of 57 of CPRF&#x27;s Duma caucus, Vyacheslav Markhayev and Mikhail Matveev, have expressed opposition to the war, although they support the &quot;protection of the people of Donbass&quot;.

Some younger members of the CPRF spoke publicly against the war, condemning it as &quot;imperialist&quot; and contrary to Marxist–Leninist principles. In September 2022, Zyuganov called in the State Duma for a general mobilization.

==Personal life==
His wife, Nadezhda Zyuganova (née Amelicheva) graduated from History Department of Oryol Pedagogical Institute. They have two children: Andrey (1968) and Tatyana (1974). They have seven grandsons and one granddaughter. 

===Sanctions===
In February 2022, Zyuganov, who voted for the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, was placed on the sanctions list by the United States, Canada, Japan, United Kingdom, Australia and the European Union.

<text>Peleg Arnold (1751–1820) was a lawyer, tavern-keeper, jurist, and statesman from Smithfield, Rhode Island (now North Smithfield). He represented Rhode Island as a delegate to the Continental Congress in the 1787–1788 session. He later served as the chief justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court from June 1795 to June 1809, and from May 1810 to May 1812.

==Personal life==
Arnold was born on June 10, 1751, at Smithfield (now North Smithfield), the ninth of the fifteen children of Thomas Arnold. His mother was Patience Cook of Newport who was Thomas&#x27; third wife. After starting in the common schools, he graduated from Brown University in Providence. Like many of his generation he prospered in a number of careers at the same time, and combined these with a government service and civic efforts.

Arnold read law, was admitted to the bar and practiced at Smithfield. He opened and kept the &quot;Peleg Arnold Tavern&quot;, which still stands at 4 Woonsocket Hill Road in North Smithfield, Rhode Island.

Arnold built his home in Union Village, which is now part of North Smithfield. During the Revolutionary War he was the colonel of the 2nd regiment of the Providence County Militia.

When the need for additional troops led to the re-formation of the 1st Rhode Island regiment of the Continental Line in 1778, Arnold was one of the proponents for the idea of using a bounty and freedom to encourage the enlistment of blacks. He continued this interest after the war when in 1790 he founded the &quot;Providence Society for the Abolition of Slavery&quot;.

Arnold&#x27;s concern for his community is also evidenced by the creation of the Smithfield Union Bank in 1803. He was the bank&#x27;s first President, and it first conducted business from his home in Union. beginning in 1810, he served as president of a local preparatory school, the Smithfield Academy. Arnold died at Smithfield on February 13, 1820, and is buried in the Union Cemetery in today&#x27;s North Smithfield. According to one source, &quot;[t]owards the close of his life Judge Peleg was widely known, not only as an extensive dealer in, but an ardent lover of, New England Rum.&quot;

==Political career==
Arnold was first elected to Rhode Island&#x27;s governing body, the General Assembly in 1777. He would serve again from May 1782 to 1783. He was appointed as a Rhode Island delegate to the Confederation Congress in 1787. A strong supporter of the 1787 Constitutional Convention, in 1788 he left the congress to return home and address the ratification of the United States Constitution. He served briefly as Deputy Governor of Rhode Island in 1790.

Arnold made two unsuccessful attempts to win a seat in the United States House of Representatives. In the election of 1794, he ran against the incumbent Benjamin Bourne as an Anti-Federalist (Country Party) candidate. When Bourne resigned in 1796, he ran in the special election to finish the incomplete term, this time as a member of the Republican Party, and lost to Elisha Reynolds Potter.

In 1795 Arnold was named the chief justice of Rhode Island&#x27;s Superior Court of Judicature, Court of Assize and General Gaol Delivery. The name of this court was changed in 1798 to the simpler &quot;The Supreme Judicial Court&quot;. The Assembly re-appointed him annually every year until June 1809. After a year off due to illness, they appointed him again from 1810 to 1812. Arnold served again in the General Assembly from 1817 to 1819. He was twice a candidate for governor, one of two major Democratic-Republican candidates in the 1806 election and their nominee in the 1815 election.

<text>Elisha Reynolds Potter (June 20, 1811 – April 10, 1882) was a politician, jurist and historian from Kingston, Rhode Island. He was a justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, and served one term in the United States House of Representatives.

==Biography==
Elisha Reynolds Potter Jr. was born in Little Rest (now Kingston), Rhode Island on June 20, 1811. His father Elisha Reynolds Potter Sr. was a lawyer who served in Congress.

He attended Kingston Academy and graduated from Harvard University in 1830. He studied law while teaching school, was admitted to the bar in 1832 and practiced in South Kingstown Township.

From 1835 to 1836 Potter was adjutant general of the state militia. He served in the Rhode Island House of Representatives from 1838 to 1840. He was a delegate to the state constitutional convention of 1841 to 1842.

In 1842 Potter was elected as a Law and Order Party candidate to the Twenty-eighth Congress, and he served one term, March 4, 1843, to March 3, 1845. During his term he was Chairman of the Committee on Revisal and Unfinished Business. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1844 to the Twenty-ninth Congress.

Potter served in the Rhode Island State Senate from 1847 to 1852, and again from 1861 to 1863. He was the state commissioner of public schools from 1849 to 1854.

On March 16, 1868, Potter became an associate justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, and he served until his death.

He died in Kingston on April 10, 1882, and was buried in the Colonel Thomas Potter Cemetery in South Kingstown.

Potter was a prolific author of Rhode Island history. Potter&#x27;s notes and correspondence now held by the Rhode Island Historical Society &quot;may be the best collection in the holdings of the Manuscripts Division for research on either the Dorr Rebellion or early 19th-century Rhode Island politics, including Rhode Island&#x27;s role in the major national issues of the day and presidential policy-making.&quot; Potter&#x27;s personally annotated copy of the printed draft of what would become the Constitution of Rhode Island is generally regarded as the best extant record, beyond the bare official minutes, of the proceedings of the 1842 constitutional convention.

<text>The Gaza–Israel barrier (sometimes called the Iron Wall) is a border barrier located on the Israeli side of the Gaza–Israel border. Before the Israel–Hamas war, the Erez Crossing, in the north of the Gaza Strip, was the only crossing point for people and goods coming from Israel into the Gaza Strip. A second crossing point, the Kerem Shalom border crossing, is used exclusively for goods coming from Egypt as Israel did not allow goods to go directly from Egypt into Gaza through the Egypt–Gaza border, except for the Salah Al Din Gate, which opened in 2018.

A fence along the border was first constructed by Israel in 1971 as a security barrier, and has been rebuilt and upgraded since. It was constructed by Israel to control the movement of people as well as goods between the Gaza Strip and Israel, which it could not achieve by normal border crossings.

There is also one crossing along the Egypt–Gaza border, the Rafah Crossing, which is limited to the crossing of people; as per Israel&#x27;s demand, any cargo or goods that are to enter Gaza must go through Israel, usually through the Kerem Shalom border crossing.

==Political background==
In 1993, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed the first of the Oslo Accords establishing the Palestinian Authority with limited administrative control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Pursuant to the Accords, Israel continues to maintain control of the Gaza Strip&#x27;s airspace, land borders (with the exception of Gaza&#x27;s border with Egypt, abandoned by Israel in 2005), and territorial waters. 

In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops from the Gaza Strip, along with thousands of Israeli settlers. Israel thus claims to have ended the occupation. However, this claim has been challenged on the basis that Israel continues to exercise control over Gaza&#x27;s territorial waters and airspace, despite Gaza not being part of Israel and Gazans not having Israeli passports.

The Gaza-Israel border straddles one of the starkest economic contrasts in the world (the Korean Demilitarized Zone is the other): on the Israeli side GDP per capita is $55,000 and population density is low, while on the Palestinian side, the GDP per capita is $1,250 and population density is among the highest in the world.

Commentators point out that fortifications like the &quot;Iron Wall&quot; will result in a more diabolical state of affairs not for the Gazans but for the Israeli society itself as it may never look past such metaphorical stonewalls to reach a socio-political compromise with the Palestinians.

==Barrier structure ==
Israel started construction of the first long barrier along its border with the Gaza Strip in 1994. In the 1994 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, it was agreed that &quot;the security fence erected by Israel around the Gaza Strip shall remain in place and that the line demarcated by the fence, as shown on the map, shall be authoritative only for the purpose of the Agreement&quot; (i.e. the barrier does not necessarily constitute the border). The initial barrier was completed in 1996.

Before the 2005 disengagement Israeli military maintained a one-kilometer buffer zone within Gaza along the border wall which prevented the militants to approach the border, sometimes with gunfire. After the IDF withdrawal the border became easily reachable by the Palestinians. Therefore Israel launched the construction of the enhanced security system along the Gaza border, estimated to cost $220 million and to be completed in mid-2006.

It includes a 7-meter wall with sensors, remote-control machine guns and barbed wire in the three areas where the border runs adjacent to Israeli settlements. The land taken from the corresponding kibbutzim was compensated for, with some controversies. 
Overall, the first barrier is a barbed-wire fence without sensors. The second barrier codenamed Hoovers A is 20 meters off and consist of a road and a fence with sensors. These existed before 2005. A new element is a 70-150 meter wide buffer zone codenamed Hoovers B with motion sensors in the ground and surrounded by a new sensor-equipped fence with watchtowers every 2 kilometers, equipped with remote-control machine guns instead of soldiers, which could be targets of Palestinian snipers.

The barrier is patrolled both from the air and on the ground.

==Response from Gaza==
The barrier has met with opposition and protests from some Palestinians in Gaza.

The barrier was largely torn down by Palestinians at the beginning of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in September 2000, followed by many terror attacks. The barrier was rebuilt between December 2000 and June 2001. A one-kilometer buffer zone was added, in addition to new high technology observation posts. Soldiers were also given new rules of engagement, which, according to &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot;, allow soldiers to fire at anyone seen crawling there at night illegally into Israeli territory. Palestinians attempting to cross the barrier into Israel by stealth have been shot and killed.

The barrier has been effective in preventing terrorists and suicide bombers from entering Israel from Gaza. Since 1996, virtually all suicide bombers trying to leave Gaza have detonated their charges at the barrier&#x27;s crossing points and were stopped while trying to cross the barrier elsewhere. From 1994 until 2004 a suicide bomber originating from within the Gaza Strip successfully carried out an attack in Israel (on 14 March 2004 in Ashdod).

The barrier&#x27;s effectiveness prompted a shift in the tactics of Palestinian militants who commenced firing Qassam rockets and mortars over the barrier.

On 27 December 2008, Israel launched the Gaza War, consisting of airstrikes and ground incursions against targets in the Gaza Strip, with the stated aim of stopping the rocket fire from and arms smuggling into the territory. The war ended on 18 January 2009, when both sides ceased military action. Israel completed its withdrawal on 21 January, and thousands of rockets and mortars have been fired from the Gaza Strip since.

===Support for a similar Egypt–Gaza barrier===
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas declared support for the Egypt–Gaza barrier, adding: &quot;It is the Egyptians’ sovereign right in their own country. Legitimate supplies should be brought through the legal crossings&quot;, although he made no such comment towards Israel&#x27;s sovereign rights. The United States announced its support for the Egypt-Gaza barrier saying it would prevent weapons smuggling. Cairo&#x27;s main Al-Azhar University officially backed the government&#x27;s decision for an Egypt-Gaza barrier saying that it was the &quot;state&#x27;s right to build along its walls facilities and obstacles that will enhance its security.&quot;

===Tunnels under the barrier===
Because of the effectiveness of the barrier in stopping infiltration of Israel by militants, they adopted a strategy of digging tunnels under the barrier. On 25 June 2006, Palestinians used an 800-metre tunnel dug over a period of months to infiltrate Israel. They attacked a patrolling Israeli armored unit, killed two Israeli soldiers, and captured another one, Gilad Shalit.

Between January and October 2013, three other tunnels were identified – two of which were packed with explosives. The discovery of similarly constructed tunnels in other parts of the world have led to updated threat assessment estimates.

During the 2014 Gaza war, Israel encountered Hamas militants who popped out of tunnels into Israel and attacked soldiers along the border. After the war, Israel located and destroyed 32 tunnels. In 2018, Israel destroyed three new tunnels.

=== Underground anti-tunnel barrier ===

In response to the large number of tunnels being dug, which could be used for infiltration by militants, in mid-2017, Israel began construction of an underground border wall several meters in depth along the entire 40-km length of the border. The wall is equipped with sensors that can detect tunnel construction. The wall is located entirely on Israeli land.

In October 2020, sensors in the underground structure identified a Hamas tunnel. An Israeli military official called the tunnel &quot;The most significant tunnel we have seen to date, both in terms of depth and infrastructure&quot;.

The anti-tunnel barrier was completed in March 2021.

==Crossing points==
From the Palestinian perspective, the crossings are crucial to the economy of the Gaza Strip and to the daily needs of the population. Chief Palestinian Authority negotiator Saeb Erekat analyzed the closures of the crossings and said they have &quot;proven to be counter-productive&quot;.

===Israel–Gaza===
As of 2023, there were two open border crossings with Israel, with an additional option via an Israel–Egypt crossing. During the war ensuing from the October 7 Hamas attack, two more emergency gates were eventually opened for aid convoys.

====Kerem Shalom Crossing====
The Kerem Shalom Crossing is the main cargo crossing, used by trucks carrying goods from Israel or Egypt to the Gaza Strip. Managed by the Israel Airports Authority. 

====Erez or Beit Hanoun Crossing====
The Erez or Beit Hanoun Crossing is the only one open for people. A pedestrian and cargo crossing into Israel, it is located in northern Gaza. The crossing is currently restricted to Arab residents under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority and to Egyptian nationals or international aid officials only, and is closed to tourists. Palestinians who have a permit to work in Israel or those with permits allowing them to receive free medical treatment or to visit immediate family who are in prisons may use this crossing when it is open for pedestrian travel.

Though 5,000 Palestinians are permitted to use the Erez Crossing to go to their places of work inside Israel, the crossing was frequently closed by the Israeli authorities, impeding their ability to get to work. Additionally, the permits issued have not always been honoured by soldiers, who in some cases confiscated them at the crossing.

On 7 October 2023, Erez Crossing was attacked and destroyed by Hamas. It remained closed until 1 May 2024, when it was reopened for aid transports heading into Gaza.

====Gate 96 emergency crossing====
On 12 March 2024, as a &quot;pilot project&quot;, the 96th gate in the security fence (near Kibbutz Be&#x27;eri) was used by a convoy of six trucks taking humanitarian aid to northern Gaza under IDF protection. Gate 96 is slowly becoming a fixture during the war allowing aid to reach Gaza City directly, be it on a minor scale.

====&quot;Northern Crossing&quot; emergency gate====
On 12 April 2024, a newly built wartime emergency crossing for humanitarian aid was opened near Kibbutz Zikim. The content of the trucks is checked by the IDF at the Kerem Shalom border crossing facility.

====From Israel via Egypt====
*Nitzana Border Crossing between Israel and Egypt is an additional nearby option. It is connected by road to Sinai and the town of El Arish, which in turn connects to Gaza via the Egyptian border crossings. During the 2023 war, aid trucks entered the Strip via El Arish, Nitzana, where the contents were inspected by Israel, and into Gaza. Nitzana crossing, however, was not designed for the processing of trucks and cargo.

====Permanently closed====
*Karni Crossing (1994–2011)
*Sufa Crossing (1994–2008)

===Egypt–Gaza===
These are being used for shipments from Israel in conjunction with the Nitzana Border Crossing (see above).
*Rafah Crossing, designed primarily for pedestrians, but used during the 2023 war as the main entry for aid trucks
*Salah al-Din Gate (area plan with gate see here), since February 2018 a secondary commercial border crossing 4 km northwest of Rafah Crossing, and named after Salah al-Din Road, the Strip&#x27;s main north-south thoroughfare. Before 2018, the gate allowed two-way humanitarian access for Gaza and Sinai residents, but didn&#x27;t serve commercial purposes. It was repurposed in 2018, when Hamas militants manned the Gaza side and taxed incoming cargo, which included goods with controversial dual use (civilian and military), apparently without much external supervision. As of July 2023, &quot;goods have also entered Gaza regularly from Egypt, via the Rafah crossing, controlled by the Egyptian authorities, and then through the adjacent Salah Ad Din Gate, controlled by the local authorities.&quot; Since 2018, the Salah Ad-Din Gate has seen a steady growth in traffic, so that in 2022/2023, over 50% of the construction materials, 25% of the food and c. 40% of non-food items entered the Strip through Salah Ad-Din Gate crossing. In 2023, c. 36% of the total imports to the Strip arrived through the Gate.

<doc id="478346" wikidata="Q4724027" url="?curid=478346" title="Algebraically compact module">
<text>In mathematics, algebraically compact modules, also called pure-injective modules, are modules that have a certain &quot;nice&quot; property which allows the solution of infinite systems of equations in the module by finitary means. The solutions to these systems allow the extension of certain kinds of module homomorphisms. These algebraically compact modules are analogous to injective modules, where one can extend all module homomorphisms. All injective modules are algebraically compact, and the analogy between the two is made quite precise by a category embedding.

== Definitions ==

Let be a ring, and a left -module. Consider a system of infinitely many linear equations
:formula_1
where both sets and may be infinite, formula_2 and for each the number of nonzero formula_3 is finite.

The goal is to decide whether such a system has a &quot;solution&quot;, that is whether there exist elements of such that all the equations of the system are simultaneously satisfied. (It is not required that only finitely many are non-zero.)

The module &quot;M&quot; is algebraically compact if, for all such systems, if every subsystem formed by a finite number of the equations has a solution, then the whole system has a solution. (The solutions to the various subsystems may be different.)

On the other hand, a module homomorphism is a &quot;pure embedding&quot; if the induced homomorphism between the tensor products is injective for every right -module . The module is pure-injective if any pure injective homomorphism splits (that is, there exists with formula_4).

It turns out that a module is algebraically compact if and only if it is pure-injective.

== Examples ==

All modules with finitely many elements are algebraically compact.

Every vector space is algebraically compact (since it is pure-injective). More generally, every injective module is algebraically compact, for the same reason.

If &quot;R&quot; is an associative algebra with 1 over some field &quot;k&quot;, then every &quot;R&quot;-module with finite &quot;k&quot;-dimension is algebraically compact. This, together with the fact that all finite modules are algebraically compact, gives rise to the intuition that algebraically compact modules are those (possibly &quot;large&quot;) modules which share the nice properties of &quot;small&quot; modules.

The Prüfer groups are algebraically compact abelian groups (i.e. Z-modules). The ring of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers for each prime &quot;p&quot; is algebraically compact as both a module over itself and a module over Z. The rational numbers are algebraically compact as a Z-module. Together with the indecomposable finite modules over Z, this is a complete list of indecomposable algebraically compact modules.

Many algebraically compact modules can be produced using the injective cogenerator Q/Z of abelian groups. If &quot;H&quot; is a &quot;right&quot; module over the ring &quot;R&quot;, one forms the (algebraic) character module &quot;H&quot;* consisting of all group homomorphisms from &quot;H&quot; to Q/Z. This is then a left &quot;R&quot;-module, and the *-operation yields a faithful contravariant functor from right &quot;R&quot;-modules to left &quot;R&quot;-modules. 
Every module of the form &quot;H&quot;* is algebraically compact. Furthermore, there are pure injective homomorphisms &quot;H&quot; → &quot;H&quot;**, natural in &quot;H&quot;. One can often simplify a problem by first applying the *-functor, since algebraically compact modules are easier to deal with.

== Facts ==

The following condition is equivalent to &quot;M&quot; being algebraically compact:
* For every index set &quot;I&quot;, the addition map &quot;M(I)&quot; → &quot;M&quot; can be extended to a module homomorphism &quot;MI&quot; → &quot;M&quot; (here &quot;M(I)&quot; denotes the direct sum of copies of &quot;M&quot;, one for each element of &quot;I&quot;; &quot;MI&quot; denotes the product of copies of &quot;M&quot;, one for each element of &quot;I&quot;).

Every indecomposable algebraically compact module has a local endomorphism ring.

Algebraically compact modules share many other properties with injective objects because of the following: there exists an embedding of &quot;R&quot;-Mod into a Grothendieck category &quot;G&quot; under which the algebraically compact &quot;R&quot;-modules precisely correspond to the injective objects in &quot;G&quot;.

Every &quot;R&quot;-module is elementary equivalent to an algebraically compact &quot;R&quot;-module and to a direct sum of indecomposable algebraically compact &quot;R&quot;-modules.

<text>Scottish &amp; Newcastle plc was a brewing company headquartered in Edinburgh, Scotland, which expanded from its home base to become an international business with beer volumes growing almost tenfold.

The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by Heineken and Carlsberg in 2008 and its assets split between them. The name Scottish &amp; Newcastle continued to be used for the UK trading operation of Heineken International until 2009, when it was renamed Heineken UK.

The former S&amp;N Pub Enterprises leased pub division was rebranded as S&amp;N Pub Company after the takeover. In 2012, it was rebranded again to Star Pubs &amp; Bars, bringing an end to Scottish &amp; Newcastle brand.

==History==

The origins of the company can be traced to Grizel Syme who ran her late second husband&#x27;s brewery: this brewery and those of her sons developed into the firm of William Younger &amp; Co. It merged with McEwan&#x27;s in 1931 becoming Scottish Brewers. In 1960 it merged again this time with Newcastle Breweries to form Scottish &amp; Newcastle.

By 1985, the company had become a regional brewer focused on Scotland and the North of England.

By 1995, with the purchase of rival brewing business Courage, S&amp;N had become the UK&#x27;s leading brewer.

In early 2000, S&amp;N expanded outside the UK via a number of acquisitions in Western Europe, growing sales to over 50 Mhl per annum. Acquisitions included Kronenbourg.

By acquiring Hartwall in 2002, Finland&#x27;s leading beverage company business, S&amp;N became 50% owners of Baltic Beverages Holding (BBH) encompassing brewing interests in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and the Baltic Countries of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. The remaining 50% of BBH was owned by Carlsberg, which gained full control after the takeover of S&amp;N in 2008.

In July 2003, S&amp;N acquired the Bulmers cider business, adding the Strongbow, Scrumpy Jack and Woodpecker brands to its portfolio, together with the UK&#x27;s biggest cider mill and orchards in Hereford.

In November 2003, S&amp;N sold its remaining pub estate to the Spirit Group – retaining a successful tenanted pub management business (S&amp;N Pub Company) with contracts to look after some 2,000 pubs on behalf of banks and other pub companies.

In 2004 some radical cost-cutting measures were introduced, particularly within the UK where it was noted by analysts that the cost base was too high. During the year, the Fountain Brewery in Edinburgh was closed, followed some months later by the Tyne Brewery in Newcastle. This was followed in 2005 by the closure of distribution depots at Bow, Chelmsford and Maidstone with the task being integrated into Dagenham Regional Distribution Centre and depots at Hackbridge and Croydon with the remainder of the London accounts being served by Greenford. The company began to use transit points in Chelmsford and Faversham as cheap logistical alternatives to full working depots. Reciprocal acquisitions saw the Caledonian Brewery in Edinburgh and the Northern Clubs&#x27; Federation Brewery in Gateshead added to the business.

In February 2005, Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Carlsberg UK finalised a joint venture to carry out Technical Services work in the UK. Service Dispense Equipment Limited (SDEL) was formed from the dispense assets of both businesses.

In 2006, S&amp;N entered into a joint venture with the Swiss-based freight company, Kuehne and Nagel to set up a UK drinks distribution company (K+N Drinks Logistics). Some 3,000 S&amp;N employees transferred to the new business.

On 17 October 2007, Heineken International and Carlsberg jointly announced that they were considering forming a consortium to bid for, and acquire the total capitalisation of Scottish &amp; Newcastle. No formal offer had been put to S&amp;N at the time. On 25 October, however, Heineken and Carlsberg announced that they had submitted a written proposal to S&amp;N. They invited S&amp;N to discuss a possible offer, the terms as to which they were prepared to proceed included a bid of 720 pence per share. The offer was immediately rejected by the Board of S&amp;N, who believed that it significantly undervalued the worth of the S&amp;N group. On 31 October, S&amp;N announced that it had requested the Danish Courts to begin arbitration proceedings between itself and Carlsberg A/S in relation to the latter&#x27;s alleged contractual infringements, relating to the joint ownership of Baltic Beverages Holdings (BBH). Carlsberg immediately countered that it believed S&amp;N&#x27;s claims were &quot;spurious and without merit&quot;.

A new offer was made public on 15 November 2007 by Carlsberg and Heineken, raising the offer to 750 pence per share. The partners claimed this was &quot;substantially in excess of the standalone independent value of S&amp;N&quot;. On 17 January 2008, S&amp;N announced that it was now in formal discussions with the consortium, following a revised proposal to purchase the business for £8 per share.

On 25 January 2008, following limited due diligence and discussions with S&amp;N, the consortium announced a formal cash offer for the entire S&amp;N business at £8 per share. This offer had the full support of the S&amp;N Board and was recommended to shareholders.

On 31 March 2008, shareholders approved the £7.8 billion takeover by Heineken and Carlsberg. The acquisition was completed on 29 April 2008 as S&amp;N&#x27;s shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange.

On 23 November 2009, the company changed its name to Heineken UK Ltd. to reflect the owner&#x27;s name.

<text>Vijayanagara () is a city located in Vijayanagara district of Karnataka state in India. Vijayanagara was the capital city of the historic Vijayanagara Empire. Located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River, it spread over a large area and included sites in the Vijayanagara district, the Ballari district, and others around these districts. A part of Vijayanagara ruins known as the Group of Monuments at Hampi has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Hampi, an ancient human settlement mentioned in Hindu texts, houses pre-Vijayanagara temples and monuments. In the early 14th century, the dominant Kakatiyas, Seuna Yadavas, Hoysalas, and the short-lived Kampili kingdom, who inhabited the Deccan region, were invaded and plundered by armies of Khalji and later Tughlaq dynasties of the Delhi Sultanate.

Vijayanagara was founded from these ruins by the Sangama brothers, who were working as soldiers in the Kampili Kingdom under Kampalidevaraya. The city grew rapidly. The Vijayanagara-centred empire functioned as a barrier to the Muslim sultanates in the north, leading to the reconstruction of Hindu life and scholarship, multi-religious activity, rapid infrastructure improvements, and economic activity. Along with Hinduism, Vijayanagara accepted communities of other faiths such as Jainism and Islam, leading to multi-religious monuments and mutual influences. Chronicles left by Persian and European travellers state Vijayanagara to be a prosperous and wealthy city.

By 1500 CE, Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world&#x27;s second largest medieval era city (after Beijing) and probably India&#x27;s richest at that time, attracting traders from Persia and Portugal.

Wars between nearby Muslim Sultanates and Hindu Vijayanagara continued, however, through the 16th century. In 1565, the Vijayanagara leader Aliya Rama Raya was captured and killed, and the city fell to a coalition of Muslim Sultanates of the Deccan Plateau. The conquered capital city of Vijayanagara was looted and destroyed for 6 months, after which it remained in ruins.

==Location and history==

Vijayanagara is located in the modern era Indian state of Karnataka, along the banks of the Tungabhadra River. The city rapidly grew from being an ancient pilgrimage centre in the 13th century, to the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the early 14th century, and becoming a metropolis of approximately by the early 16th century. By 1500 CE, It became the world&#x27;s second largest city, after Beijing. Memoirs by foreigners estimate the population was about 500,000, but others find this estimate to be either generous or too conservative.

The architecture of the capital, Vijayanagara, is purposely aligned with the natural features of the city from the time of Rama. Vijayanagara was founded around the religious Hindu temple complex, Pampa Tirtha, and Kishkindha that already existed at Hampi. The name of the city centre, Hampi, is derived from Pampa, another name of goddess Parvati in Hindu theology. According to &quot;Sthala Purana&quot;, Parvati (Pampa) pursued her ascetic lifestyle to win over and bring ascetic Shiva back into householder life on the banks of Tungabhadra river, on Hemakuta hill, now a part of Hampi. Shiva is also called Pampapati (lit. &quot;husband of Pampa&quot;), and the river came to be known as Pampa river. The Sanskrit word Pampa morphed into the Kannada word Hampa, and the place Parvati pursued what she wanted came to be known as Hampe or Hampi. Its Hindu significance also comes from the Kishkindha chapters of the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, where Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, Sugriva, and the monkey army in their search for kidnapped Sita. The Hampi area has many close resemblances to the place described in the epic. Traditionally understood to be the place described in the Ramayana, the region attracts many pilgrims.

Prior to its founding, Hindus and kings of various kingdoms visited Hampi. Hoysala Empire&#x27;s Hindu kings built and supported the Hampi pilgrimage centre before the 14th century. At the start of the 14th century, the armies of Delhi Sultanate, first those of Alauddin Khalji and later of Muhammad bin Tughlaq invaded and pillaged South India. The Hoysala Empire and temple cities such as those in Halebidu, Belur and Somanathapura were plundered in early 14th century. From the ruins of this collapse and destruction emerged Vijayanagara Empire and its new capital Vijayanagara. The city was founded by Harihara I and Bukka, the Sangama brothers.
The city was already a sacred site of pilgrimage for devotees of Shiva in the 10th century. It became the most powerful urban centre in the Deccan between 14th to 16th centuries and one of the ten largest cities of the world. The Renaissance Portuguese and Persian traders reported it as a marvellous achievement.

The city was a powerful urban centre in South India from 14th to 16th century and one of the ten largest cities of the world. It stood as a bastion of Hindu values dedicated to fighting back the encroachments of the Muslim sultans from the north, who soon came to be operating from Golkonda. The Sangama dynasty was involved in repeated conflicts with the Bahamani Sultanate. The Bahamanis had later disintegrated into five sultanates which formed a Deccan alliance. Krishnadevaraya after the Battle of Raichur allowed one sultan to stay in power rather than let it split into smaller kingdoms. However, later Vijayanagara kings had to contend with multiple Sultanates to their north. The Vijayanagara kingdom befriended and allowed the Portuguese to take control of Goa and western territories of the Bahamani Sultanate. The sultanates united against the Vijayanagara Empire.

An ongoing war between Muslim Sultanates and the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire led to the Battle of Talikota in 1565 CE, fought about north. It resulted in the capture and beheading of Vijayanagara leader Aliya Rama Raya, mass confusion within the Vijayanagara forces and a shock defeat. The Sultanate army then reached Vijayanagara, looted, destroyed and burnt it down to ruins over a period of several months. This is evidenced by the quantities of charcoal, the heat-cracked basements and burnt architectural pieces found by archaeologists in Vijayanagara region. The urban Vijayanagara was abandoned and remained in ruins ever since. Vijayanagara never recovered from the ruins.

The Italian Cesare Federici writing two years after the empire&#x27;s defeat states that &quot;The Citie of Bezeneger (Vijayanagara) is not altogether destroyed, yet the houses stand still, but empty, and there is dwelling in them nothing, as is reported, but Tygres and other wild beasts.&quot;

Archaeological evidence suggests that while the urban settlement was abandoned, a number of rural settlement in the metropolitan region were not fully emptied. Some population remained in the region (though there is no good assessment of how much), and a number of settlements founded in the Vijayanagara period remain occupied up to the present.

==Description==

The name translates as &quot;City of Victory&quot;, from &quot;vijaya&quot; (victory) and &quot;nagara&quot; (city). As the prosperous capital of the largest and most powerful kingdom of its time in South India, Vijayanagara attracted people from all around the world.
The ruined city is a World Heritage Site, known in that context as the Ruins of Hampi. In recent years there have been concerns regarding damage to the site at Hampi from heavy vehicular traffic and the construction of road bridges in the vicinity. Hampi was listed as a &quot;threatened&quot; World Heritage Site by the UNESCO but was later removed from the list after appropriate corrective measures were taken.

Traveller memoirs before 1565 CE record it as a large and developed metropolitan area. The Italian Cesari Federici writing two years after the Vijayanagara Empire&#x27;s military defeat in 1565 describes the city after its ruin, &quot;is not altogether destroyed, yet the houses stand still, but emptie [sic], and there is dwelling in them nothing, as is reported, but Tygres and other wild beasts.&quot;

Recent commentaries state:

Sanjay Subrahmanyam states that Vijayanagara was arguably one of the only three centres during this period with a population of over 100,000 in South India and that from the contemporary accounts and what remains of its expanse, the city proper and the suburbs had a population of 500,000 to 600,000. He notes that Domingo Paes had estimated its size at 100,000 houses.

==Area==
Vijayanagara includes:
*Hampi, now UNESCO World Heritage Site.
*Anegundi, on the north side of the Tungabhadra River, in Koppal district.
*Kamalapura, a small temple town to the southeast of the Royal Centre, also houses an archaeological museum.
*Hospet, a city and railhead, to the southwest.
*Monuments spread Vijayanagara and nearby districts.

<text>The Fiat 127 is a supermini car produced by Italian car manufacturer Fiat from 1971 to 1983. It was introduced in 1971 as the replacement for the Fiat 850. Production of the 127 in Italy ended in 1983 following the introduction of its replacement, the Fiat Uno, although the nameplate continued to be used on cars imported from Brazil.

The 127, designed by Pio Manzù, is generally regarded as one of the most influential small cars of all time, and more than any other as the car which defined the modern supermini – with its body configuration and engineering template being followed in almost all B-segment cars that followed. Superminis typically emulate the 127&#x27;s transverse engine layout, with an end-on mounted transmission and front wheel drive, and are sold overwhelmingly in hatchback format.


==Series 1==
Developed towards the end of the 1960s, the Fiat 127 was launched as a two-door saloon in April 1971. A three-door hatchback, using an identical body profile but with a full-depth rear door and folding rear seat, was launched in March of the following year; this would prove to be the most popular version of the 127. This was Fiat&#x27;s first supermini-sized hatchback. The 127 featured a state-of-the-art transverse-engine/front-wheel-drive layout, with the transmission mounted on the end of the engine. Both design ideas had been fully vetted by Fiat, using its Autobianchi subsidiary 1964 Primula, 1969 A112 and A111 — precisely because the models were not targeted for large production. The larger Fiat 128, launched in 1969, was the first Fiat-badged car to use the same transverse powertrain layout. The 127, like the A112, used a shrunken version of the 128 platform, as well as the rugged Fiat OHV 100 series 903 cc engine that had powered the Autobianchi and, with various cylinder capacities, earlier generations of Fiat cars. The 127 also featured a unique transverse leaf spring suspension at the rear. Safety was another area of innovation: the 127 included an articulated steering column and crumple zones for progressive deformation under impact.

The car was one of the first of the modern superminis, and won praise for its use of space (80 percent of the floor space was available for passengers and luggage) as well as its road-holding. It was launched a year before the comparable Renault 5, and before the end of the 1970s most mass market European manufacturers were producing similar cars, including the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo, while General Motors added a three-door hatchback to the Opel Kadett range, which was reworked for British production and sold as the Vauxhall Chevette. The 127 was also one of the more popular imported cars on the UK market, peaking at more than 20,000 sales in 1978.

It was also the first car fitted with an all-polypropylene bumper on steel support. The 127 was an instant success, winning the European Car of the Year award for 1972, and quickly became one of the best-selling cars in Europe for several years. It was the third Fiat in six years to receive this accolade.

In June 1974, slightly over three years after the model&#x27;s introduction, Fiat reported that the one millionth 127 had been completed at the Mirafiori plant in Turin, after just over three years in production. The (in its time) hugely successful Fiat 600 had taken seven years to reach that same milestone.

The Series 1 car changed little during its lifetime. However, in May 1973 saloons became available in both standard and deluxe versions. In 1975 the 127 Special variant was released which featured a restyled front grille and detail changes to the interior. The deluxe version was differentiated by its reclining front seats and opening hinged rear side windows as standard equipment. In early 1976, the 127&#x27;s engine was lightly modified to help it meet new emissions standards. A new carburetor and adjusted valve timing lowered power by two horsepower but also increased fuel economy by about ten percent.

==Series 2==
The Series 2 version of the 127 debuted in May 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAM77/78&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bodyshell remained fundamentally the same, the Series 2 hinted towards a more angular styling direction which would be seen in the Ritmo/Strada the following year. It featured a restyled front and rear and larger rear side windows, losing the upswept belt line of the Series 1, as well as adding a distinctive &quot;Hofmeister kink&quot; on the C-pillar. The new rear quarter pressings were derived from those used on the Brazilian market Fiat 147, although without the rear quarter extraction vent used in South America. The Series 2 also offered the option of the 1049 cc engine - uniquely for the 127 this was the five-bearing OHC &quot;Brazil&quot; engine from the 147 rather than the Fiat OHC unit from the 128. The tailgate was extended and now reached nearly to the rear bumper, addressing complaints about the high lip over which luggage had to be lifted for loading into the earlier 127 hatchbacks. The interior was revised with a new dashboard which was identical in layout to the original car but was plainer in appearance and lost the wood embellishment of the Series 1. The underside of the dashboard was tidied up with new cover panels to enclose the steering column, brake master cylinder (on right hand drive versions) and the pedal mechanisms.

A new Sport model was available from June 1978 which featured a high output version of the standard 1049 cc engine. This was achieved by incorporating Abarth revisions to the head with larger valves and an Abarth exhaust system and the use of a twin choke Weber carburetor. Changes were also made to the gearbox final ratio to improve the performance. The Sport model has bespoke high back sporty cloth seats with either blue or orange piping and bespoke racing wing mirrors as well as a rev counter, sports wheels, sports leather steering wheel and sport three-piece stripe with 127 Sport decals. It was available in three colours, Black with orange stripes, Silver with black stripes and Orange with black stripes.

In March 1980, the 147 Panorama went on sale in several European markets with &quot;127&quot; badging, originally only with the 1050 engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAM82/83.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Panorama used the 147&#x27;s recently updated &quot;Europa&quot; front, with reverse-angled rectangular headlights and blocky combined markerlights/turn signals wrapping around the corners. There was also a &quot;high-cube&quot; panel van version, known as the Fiorino, which was based on the Series 2 bodyshell. This remained in production until the end of 1987, when a new Uno-based Fiorino debuted.

===Brazilian-built versions===
The 147 itself went on sale in Italy under the name of 127 Rustica in 1979. This was a version meant for light off-road work, and received a spartan appearance and equipment. The 127 Rustica benefitted from the 147&#x27;s stronger body, 1050 cc engine, reinforced suspension (&quot;tropical&quot; type springs front and rear), and a skid plate. The front and rear lights were protected by mesh grilles mounted on model-specific tubular metal bumpers, while it had the Brazilian dashboard and specific, lightly padded seats with a tubular structure and covered in brown leatherette. The Rustica was only offered with semi-matte military beige paint, black rims without hubcaps and winter tires, with the only option being a metal luggage rack. Noisy and very particular, the Rustica was removed from price lists in 1981 without a proper replacement until the 1983 introduction of the Panda 4x4. The Rusticas were assembled in Lamborghini&#x27;s Sant&#x27;Agata Bolognese plant.

At the 1981 Geneva Motor Show, a diesel-engined version of the 127 was introduced with hatchback or Panorama bodywork. The diesel Series 2 was only built in Brazil and is technically a rebadged 147; it uses that model&#x27;s headlight treatment which it shared with the 127 Panorama. The 147 had a stronger structure to better handle Brazilian roads and was considered more suitable for the additional weight and vibrations of the diesel engine. The Panorama and Diesel versions retained this design even as the Italian-made 127 changed over to the Series 3. From 1983, the &quot;127 Unificata&quot; introduced the same design across the entire 127/147 lineups.

==Series 3==

Despite a completely new replacement being only a year away, the Series 3 was presented in November 1981 and launched in Italy and other European markets in January 1982. It is distinguishable from the Series 2 by its grille. The third series received a completely new dashboard design and interior, following the design language first seen in the Ritmo. Body panels are all as before, except for a longer bonnet required to clear the larger headlights. The 1301 cc Fiat Fiasa engine replaced the earlier 1050 in the Series 3 Sport. New for the Series 3 was also the option of a five-speed manual transmission, a first for the 127 as it had not fit in earlier models. It was available in the 1050 Super (called &quot;Comfort&quot; in some markets) and was also installed in the 127 Sport. The new 127 Sport cost less than its more highly strung predecessor, and had more power from its larger engine. It remained on sale in Italy until December 1983, when the Uno Turbo replaced it.

In nations like Norway, Denmark and Finland this generation was particularly successful. For 1983, Swiss buyers received the Autobianchi A112&#x27;s 965 cc engine rather than the 903 cc unit in the 127 Special, so that the importer would not have to make two similar engines pass local emissions standards. Fiat also bumped up the compression ratio and installed a somewhat larger carburetor in the 1.05-litre 127 Super, increasing power somewhat so as to maintain its power advantage over the lesser 127 Special.

The 127 was replaced as Fiat&#x27;s high volume product in this sector by the Fiat Uno in January 1983, though Italian manufacture continued until the end of 1983 and it continued in production in South America until 1995. The 127 disappeared from the right-hand drive British market soon after the Uno went on sale there in June 1983.

===127 Unificata===
After Italian production ended, Fiat imported the South American 127 &quot;Unificata&quot; to Europe until 1987, albeit only for left-hand drive markets. It is called &quot;Unificata&quot; (&quot;unified&quot;) as all models now received the same design; until then, Brazilian-made cars had their own design, meaning that 127 Diesel and Panorama models had been of very different appearance than their Series 2 and Series 3 siblings. The Unificata range was condensed, leaving only the 1050 petrol engine and the diesel. The five-door version was also discontinued, although SEAT kept offering this bodystyle on their Fura until 1986.

==International variants==
===SEAT 127===

As happened with other Fiat models of that era, SEAT made a Spanish version of this car called the SEAT 127. Due to SEAT design policy, a 4-door variant of the car was also produced, as well as a later five-door version. The second series&#x27; change to the side profile was also applied to these four-door versions, with a flatter and more angular rear side window line. SEAT also produced a unique variant of the 127 OHV engine. This had 1010 cc instead of 903 cc and produced . The four-door SEAT 127 was exported to certain markets with Fiat badging.

When their licence from Fiat expired, SEAT redesigned some parts of the car and created the SEAT Fura Dos. Some design parts of this model were also used in the Ibiza mark 1. SEAT produced 1,238,166 units of the 127 between 1972 and 1984.

===Polski Fiat 127p===

Fiat 127 was also produced under Fiat license by Polish automobile manufacturers FSO (between 1973 and 1975) and FSM (between 1974 and 1975) under the name Polski Fiat 127p. These were assembled using both Italian and Polish parts. Originally the Polski Fiat 127p was to be produced in large numbers as a people&#x27;s car, but when it became apparent that it would be about 30% more expensive than the 126p it was decided to concentrate on the latter while the larger 127p was only produced in very small numbers.

===Fiat 147===

In Brazil the car was known as the Fiat 147 (later Spazio), a three-door station wagon version called &quot;Panorama&quot;. There was also a conventional two-door three-box saloon available, &quot;Fiat Oggi&quot;, a pick-up called &quot;City&quot; and a van called &quot;Fiorino&quot; was also produced there. The Brazilian-built versions utilized a 1050 cc engine and a 1300 cc engine called &quot;Fiasa&quot; and also utilized a 1.3 L Diesel engine (for export markets only). From 1981 this variant (called a 127) was exported to Europe, to be sold alongside the 127 sedans and hatchbacks. A total of 1,169,312 units were built from 9 July 1976 to the end of 1986 in Brazil and 232,807 units were also built in Argentina between 1982 and 1996, as the Fiat 147, Spazio, and Vivace. It was also assembled in the CCA in Colombia.

Although the car achieved reasonable selling figures, the model was titled as &quot;low-level&quot; and &quot;not so reliable&quot; by early buyers, because Fiat was just starting to sell cars in Brazil in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was the first model produced by FIAT in Brazil, in 1976.

===VAZ-1101===
The Soviet manufacturer VAZ expanded its existing collaboration with Fiat in the early 1970s to develop a 127-derived supermini which would have slotted below the existing Fiat 124-based Zhiguli sedan. The car, designated VAZ-1101 however never made production, but formed the basis of the later Lada Niva (VAZ-2121) off-roader, which as a result, retained key styling features of the Fiat 127 - most notably the distinctive forward-opening &#x27;clamshell&#x27; hood; with the stepped beltline and glasshouse also bearing a strong resemblance to the 127.

==Specials==
Italian coachbuilder Moretti made a canvas-topped version in the style of the Renault Rodeo and Citroën Méhari called the &quot;Midimaxi&quot; (to set it apart from the smaller, 126-based Minimaxi). In spite of its rugged appearance, the front-wheel drive underpinnings remained the same. The Midimaxi was first shown at the 1971 Turin Motor Show, which was also when the very similar Fissore 127 Scout first appeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAM74/75&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another special was a station wagon derivative (127 Familiare) developed by small Turinese coachbuilders Coriasco, first shown in 1971. Coriasco also developed a panel van derivative. In 1978, Coriasco presented a high-roofed leisure vehicle version, akin to the Talbot Matra Rancho, called the Coriasco 127 Farm. Coriasco displayed two 127 Coupés but these never entered production.

<text>The River Dargle () is a river that flows from the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland to the Irish Sea. It forms Powerscourt Waterfall, receives the Glencree and Glencullen Rivers, and later the Glenmunder Stream / County Brook, and the Swan River at Bray, and reaches the sea at Bray Harbour.

==Course==
The Dargle rises in the Wicklow Mountains, Ireland, on the southern slopes of Tonduff . It flows down the Glensoulan hanging valley, to fall over the Powerscourt Waterfall. The Dargle then flows through the Glencree valley where it is fed by the River Glencree, before flowing east for a further . It receives the Glencullen River, and later the Glenmunder Stream, also known as the County Brook or Ballyman Stream. A final small tributary, the Swan River, joins opposite the People&#x27;s Park, Little Bray. The final section reaches the Irish Sea at Bray Harbour.

==Name==
The river&#x27;s name in Irish, , refers to the tint of red in the rocks at its source (the Irish word means red).

==Historical events==
===Battle of Bloody Bank===
In August 1401 the O&#x27;Byrne clan of County Wicklow, who periodically raided Dublin, encamped a large mercenary army, composed mainly of their relatives, the O&#x27;Meagher clan, on the banks of the Dargle near Bray. The authorities in Dublin received advance warning of the intended raid from the Walsh family of Carrickmines, whose lands stood directly in the path of the mercenary army. Led by John Drake, who was three times Lord Mayor of Dublin, the citizens of Dublin supported by the Walsh clan, scored a decisive victory, commemorated as the Battle of Bloody Bank, over the O&#x27;Byrnes and O&#x27;Meaghers on the banks of the Dargle. The slaughter was so terrible (one estimate puts the death toll at 4000, although this was probably an exaggeration) that the area became known as Bloody Bank until it was renamed in the nineteenth century as Sunny Bank. The outcome greatly improved the security of Dublin, and seriously weakened the power of the O&#x27;Byrne clan.

==Cultural references==
Sir Walter Scott visited the area in 1825 and mistakenly assumed that Dargle was the name for any glen, etc. He used the word in his novel &quot;Redgauntlet&quot; seven years later: &quot;Glen, nor dargle, nor mountain, nor cave, could hide the puir hill-folk&quot;.

About 1838 the eminent judge Philip Cecil Crampton, who lived at St. Valery House, by the Dargle, became a supporter of the temperance movement: to show his fidelity to the cause, he emptied the entire contents of his wine cellar into the river.

The folk song Waxies&#x27; Dargle makes an indirect reference to the river. Non-religious holidays in Dublin - especially tradesmen&#x27;s days off - were traditionally referred to as a &quot;Dargle Days&quot; (from the habit of the Irish upper classes of travelling to the banks of the Dargle to picnic and engage in field sports such as tennis, on such days). The &quot;Waxie&#x27;s Dargle&quot;, on the other hand, is a humorous reference to the annual outing of the Dublin shoe-makers and repairers (who were known as &quot;Waxies&quot;, from their habit of periodically running a ball of wax along the string as they stitched) to Irishtown on the River Dodder.

<doc id="478364" wikidata="Q1140499" url="?curid=478364" title="Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking">
<text>Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) was a program run by NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, surveying the sky for near-Earth objects. NEAT was conducted from December 1995 until April 2007, at GEODSS on Hawaii (Haleakala-NEAT; 566), as well as at Palomar Observatory in California (Palomar-NEAT; 644). With the discovery of more than 40 thousand minor planets, NEAT has been one of the most successful programs in this field, comparable to the Catalina Sky Survey, LONEOS and Mount Lemmon Survey.

NEAT was the successor to the Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS).

== History ==
The original principal investigator was Eleanor F. Helin, with co-investigators Steven H. Pravdo and David L. Rabinowitz.

NEAT had a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Air Force to use a GEODSS telescope located on Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii. GEODSS stands for Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance and these wide field Air Force telescopes were designed to optically observe Earth orbital spacecraft. The NEAT team designed a CCD camera and computer system for the GEODSS telescope. The CCD camera format was 4096 × 4096 pixels and the field of view was 1.2° × 1.6°.

Beginning in April 2001, the Samuel Oschin telescope ( aperture Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory) was also put into service to discover and track near-Earth objects. This telescope was equipped with a camera containing 112 CCDs each 2400 × 600. This was the telescope that produced the images leading to the discovery of 50000 Quaoar in 2002, and 90377 Sedna in 2003 (published 2004) and the dwarf planet Eris.

In addition to discovering thousands of asteroids, NEAT was also credited with the co-discovery (recovery) of periodic comet 54P/de Vico-Swift-NEAT and of the high proper motion Teegarden&#x27;s star. The C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) comet was discovered on August 24, 2001 by NEAT.

An asteroid was named in its honour, 64070 NEAT, in early 2005.

== Discoveries ==

1996 PW was discovered on 1996 August 9 by a NEAT automated search camera on Haleakalā, Hawaii. It was the first object that was not an active comet discovered on an orbit typical of a long-period comets. This raised the possibility it was an extinct comet or an unusual asteroid.

<doc id="478369" wikidata="Q1855987" url="?curid=478369" title="Ross Castle">
<text>Ross Castle () is a 15th-century tower house and keep on the edge of Lough Leane, in Killarney National Park, County Kerry, Ireland. It is the ancestral home of the Chiefs of the Clan O&#x27;Donoghue, later associated with the Brownes of Killarney.

The castle is operated by the Office of Public Works, and is open to the public seasonally with guided tours.

==History==
Ross Castle was built in the late 15th century by local ruling clan the O&#x27;Donoghues Mór (Ross), though ownership changed hands during the Second Desmond Rebellion of the 1580s to the MacCarthy Mór. He then leased the castle and the lands to Sir Valentine Browne, ancestor of the Earls of Kenmare. The castle was amongst the last to surrender to Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Roundheads during the Irish Confederate Wars, and was only taken when artillery was brought by boat via the River Laune. Lord Muskerry (MacCarthy) held the castle against Edmund Ludlow who marched to Ross with 4,000 foot-soldiers and 200 horse; however, it was by water that he attacked the stronghold. The Irish had a prophecy that Ross could never be taken until a warship could swim on the lake, an unbelievable prospect. 

::Ross may all assault disdain
::Till on Lough Lein strange ship shall sail.


At the end of the wars, the Brownes were able to show that their heir was too young to have taken part in the rebellion and they retained the lands. By about 1688, they had erected a mansion house near the castle, but their adherence to King James II of England after the Glorious Revolution caused them to be exiled. The castle became a military barracks, which remained so until early in the 19th century. The Brownes did not return to live at Ross but built Kenmare House near Killarney.

There is a legend that O&#x27;Donoghue leapt or was sucked out of the window of the grand chamber at the top of the castle and disappeared into the waters of the lake along with his horse, his table and his library. It is said that O&#x27;Donoghue now lives in a great palace at the bottom of the lake where he keeps a close eye on everything that he sees.

===Governors===
Governors of the garrison at Ross Castle included:
*–1652: Pierce Ferriter
*Sir John Peyton, Bt (died 1675)
*: Colonel Sir John Edgeworth
*: Colonel Richard Hedges
*1715: John Sterling
*1721: William FitzMaurice, 2nd Earl of Kerry (died 1747)
*1753–1762: Lieut-General John Folliot
*1762: Sir Francis Lumm, 1st Baronet (died 1797) (High Sheriff of King&#x27;s County, 1755)
*–1801: Lieut-General Charles Eustace (1736-1801) (MP for Fethard, Wexford)
*1801–1835: Lieut-General Sir Henry Johnson

==Defensive features==

===Basic structure===
The castle is typical of strongholds of Irish chieftains built during the Middle Ages. The tower house had square bartizans on diagonally opposite corners and a thick end wall. The tower was originally surrounded by a square bawn defended by round corner towers on each end.

===Front entrance===
The front entrance was a small anteroom secured by an iron grill or &#x27;yett&#x27; at the outer wall. The yett could be closed from the inside via a chain that could then be secured even if the front door was closed. This room provided small side access holes and a &quot;murder-hole&quot; above which allowed the defenders to attack anybody in the room.

The front door, on the inside of the anteroom, was constructed of two layers of thick Irish oak, one layer 90 degrees to the other with the boards riveted together. If the door was a single layer with the wood fibres going in a single direction, it would have been possible to split the door. The second cross-layer prevented that. The door opened inward and was backed by two heavy beams fitted into the stone structure.

===Windows===
Windows at the lower levels were vertical thin slits preventing entrance into the structure but allowing persons inside to aim and fire arrows or guns at attackers. The windows on the top levels were larger to allow in light. It was felt that attackers would not be able to scale to those heights so larger windows were safe.

===Machicolation===
Machicolations were stone structures at the top of the castle protruding out from the wall with a hole in the floor. There are two on Ross Castle, one over the front door and another on the back wall. The one at the front would allow defenders to drop stones or boiling oil on attackers at the front door, the only entrance to the castle.

===Parapet===
The parapet at roof level is &#x27;crenellated&#x27; providing ups, &#x27;merlons&#x27; and downs, &#x27;crenels&#x27;, to allow defenders to hide behind the merlons while firing arrows or guns through the crenels.

===Inner rooms===
The first floor was used for storage.

The second floor was a living space for the house attendants and guards. Straw was spread on the floor to sleep on. There was typically no furniture.

The third floor was for food preparation and living and eating space for the house attendants and guards.

The fourth floor was the sleeping and living space for the chieftain and his family. The fourth floor had an arched stone roof supporting a stone floor of the fifth story as compared to the wood beam floors of the lower stories.

The fifth floor was the great room where the chieftain ate and entertained. This room was also the last sanctuary as it had a stone floor as a fire break from fire in the lower floors.

<doc id="478370" wikidata="Q4983112" url="?curid=478370" title="Buckfast Tonic Wine">
<text>Buckfast Tonic Wine is a caffeinated alcoholic drink consisting of fortified wine with added caffeine, originally made by monks at Buckfast Abbey in Devon, England. It is now made under a licence granted by the monastery, and distributed by J. Chandler &amp; Company in Great Britain, James E McCabe Ltd in Northern Ireland, and Richmond Marketing Ltd in Ireland. The wine&#x27;s distributor reported record sales of £43.2 million as of March 2017.

Despite being marketed as a tonic, Buckfast has become notorious in Scotland for its association with ned culture and “antisocial behaviour.”

==History==
The wine, which is still manufactured using many of the same ingredients, is based on a traditional recipe from France. The Benedictine monks at Buckfast Abbey first made the tonic wine in the 1890s. It was originally sold in small quantities as a medicine using the slogan &quot;Three small glasses a day, for good health and lively blood&quot;.

In 1927, the Abbey lost its licence to sell wine. As a result, the Abbot allowed wine merchants to distribute on behalf of the Abbey. At the same time, the recipe was changed to be less of a patent medicine and more of a medicated wine.

The wine, which comes in distinct brands depending on the market, has achieved popularity in working class, student, and bohemian communities in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland, Buckfast is packaged in a darker bottle, has a slightly lower alcoholic strength, and lacks the vanillin flavouring present in the British version. Buckfast sold in Northern Ireland, where it has been nicknamed &quot;Lurgan champagne&quot;, is the same as that sold in the rest of the UK.

==Versions==
Buckfast contains 15% alcohol in the 750 ml green-bottled UK version, and 14.8% in the brown-bottled Republic of Ireland version, which equates to roughly 11.25 UK units of alcohol.

Both versions of the drink contain phosphate and glycerophosphate, each of these as the sodium and/or potassium salt.

The &quot;brown bottle&quot; Buckfast sold in Ireland has a caffeine content similar to an espresso coffee (60 mg/100 ml) and higher than Red Bull (32 mg/100 ml). The UK-sold &quot;green bottle&quot; Buckfast has a caffeine content higher than black tea but lower than coffee (37,5 mg/100 ml).

==Antisocial image==

In certain parts of Scotland, Buckfast is associated with drinkers who are prone to committing anti-social behaviour when drunk, especially drinkers under 18 years old. The drink has a very high caffeine content, with each 750 ml bottle containing 281 mg of caffeine, the equivalent of eight cans of cola. It has been suggested that this may cause it to act as a stimulant, while removing inhibitions, self-control and a feeling of having drunk enough. Research into similar drinks have failed to find clear evidence for the latter effect. A diet of four bottles a day has been described in a Scottish court as &#x27;not conducive to a long life&#x27;.
The beverage has entered the popular lexicon with nicknames such as &quot;Wreck the Hoose Juice&quot;, &quot;Commotion Lotion&quot;, &quot;Cumbernauld Rocket Fuel&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot;, &quot;Buckie Baracas&quot;, &quot;Coatbridge Table Wine&quot;, &quot;Jakey Juice&quot; , and a bottle of &quot;What the hell are you looking at?&quot; It has earned the unofficial slogan, &quot;Buckfast: gets you F*cked, fast&quot; The drink&#x27;s prominence within the &quot;Buckfast/Buckie Triangle&quot; – an area east of Glasgow between Airdrie, Coatbridge and Bellshill – has raised concern. The glass bottle has been blamed for allegedly contributing to litter and providing drunkards with a weapon.

Several Scottish politicians and social activists have singled out Buckfast Tonic Wine as being particularly responsible for crime, disorder, and general social deprivation in these communities. Although Buckfast accounts for only 0.5% of alcohol sales in Scotland, it is responsible for 80% of public intoxication incidents. There have been numerous calls for the drink to be banned, either throughout the country or in certain areas or shops, made more expensive to dissuade people from buying the product, or sold in plastic bottles to reduce glassing incidents. Helen Liddell, former Secretary of State for Scotland, called for the wine to be banned. 

In 2005, Scottish Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson suggested that retailers should stop selling the wine. On a subsequent visit to Auchinleck within her constituency, she was greeted by teenagers chanting, &quot;Don&#x27;t ban Buckie&quot;. All of these initiatives have been countered by lawyers acting for Buckfast distributors, J. Chandler &amp; Company, in Andover. A further consequence was that Buckfast sales increased substantially in the months following Jamieson&#x27;s comments.

In September 2006, Andy Kerr, the Scottish Executive&#x27;s Health Minister, described the drink as &quot;an irresponsible drink in its own right&quot; and a contributor to anti-social behaviour. The distributors denied the claims and accused him of showing &quot;bad manners&quot; and a &quot;complete lack of judgement&quot; regarding the drink. Kerr met with J. Chandler &amp; Company to discuss ways of lessening Buckfast&#x27;s impact on west Scotland but the talks broke up without agreement. Three months later, Jack McConnell, First Minister of Scotland, stated that Buckfast had become &quot;a badge of pride amongst those who are involved in antisocial behaviour.&quot; In response the distributors accused the Scottish Executive of trying to avoid having to deal with the consequences of failed social policy and the actual individuals involved in antisocial behaviour by blaming it on the drinks industry.&quot;

In January 2010, a BBC investigation revealed that Buckfast had been mentioned in 5,638 crime reports in the Strathclyde area of Scotland from 2006 to 2009, equating to an average of three per day. In 2017, Scottish Police reported there had been 6,500 crimes related to the drink in the previous two years. One in 10 of those offences had been violent and 114 times in that period a Buckfast bottle was used as a weapon.
A survey at a Scottish young offenders&#x27; institution showed that of the 117 people who drank alcohol before committing their crimes, 43 per cent said they had drunk Buckfast. In another study of litter around a typical council estate in Scotland, 35 per cent of the items identified as rubbish were Buckfast bottles.

In 2016, a sheriff said there was a &quot;very definite association between Buckfast and violence&quot; while sentencing a man for hitting a 15-year-old boy over the head with a bottle at a birthday party. In January 2018, a trial at the High Court in Edinburgh heard that a man had consumed lager and a whole bottle of Buckfast before ferociously stabbing a workmate.

In July 2017, the British trade magazine &quot;The Grocer&quot; reported that increased sales of Buckfast in southeast England had pushed the drink up to 91 on the UK&#x27;s top 100 alcoholic brands. The increased sales followed a marketing campaign to improve the drink&#x27;s image.

In 2017, thousands of empty Buckfast bottles were recovered during a clean-up of the Claddagh Basin in Galway, Ireland.

===Manufacturer&#x27;s response===
The monks of Buckfast Abbey and their distribution partner, J. Chandler &amp; Company, deny that their product is harmful, saying that it is responsibly and legally enjoyed by the great majority of purchasers. They point out that the areas identified with its acute misuse have been economically deprived for decades and Buckfast represents less than one per cent of the total alcohol sales across Scotland. Abbot of Buckfast Abbey David Charlesworth has said that the tonic wine his monastery produces &quot;is not made to be abused&quot;.

In February 2013, J. Chandler &amp; Company applied to the Court of Session in Edinburgh to stop Strathclyde Police from marking bottles of Buckfast so they could trace where under-age drinkers bought them. A company spokesman complained, &quot;This is discrimination at the highest level. Buckfast is no more involved in crime than any other brand of alcohol&quot;. A former head of the Scottish Police Federation said: &quot;Buckfast, the distributors and the lawyers who act on behalf of the monks refuse, point blank, to take any responsibility for the antisocial behaviour that&#x27;s caused by the distribution and the consumption of Buckfast. They even refuse to change the glass bottles to plastic bottles despite overwhelming evidence that large areas in play parks and certain areas in Scotland are littered with this green glass&quot;.

In February 2014, the case was settled without any judgment being made by the court. Assistant Chief Constable Wayne Mawson of Police Scotland apologised to J. Chandler &amp; Co for asking a shopkeeper to stop selling Buckfast and gave written undertakings not to include the product in any bottle-marking scheme, unless it has &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; for doing so, and &quot;not to request licensed retailers, situated anywhere in Scotland, to cease stocking for sale Buckfast Tonic Wine&quot;. 

In 2016 sales of Buckfast Tonic Wine reached record yearly profits of £8.8 million. The abbey trust, which is a shareholder of the Hampshire-based wine&#x27;s distributor and seller, J. Chandler, gets a royalty fee for every bottle sold. Although the trust declined to release specific sales figures, it said it &quot;strives to work with J. Chandler and Co to ensure that the tonic wine is marketed and distributed responsibly&quot;.

==Buckfast Day==
In 2015, a &quot;National Buckfast Day&quot; was set up by fans to honour the tonic wine. The organisers designated the second Saturday of each May National Buckfast Day. The organisers decided to rename the day World Buckfast Day for 2016. By its third year, several celebratory events were held on different continents around the world.

<text>Goran Višnjić ( ; born 9 September 1972) is a Croatian-American actor who has appeared in American and British films and television productions. He is best known for his roles as Dr. Luka Kovač in &quot;ER&quot; and Garcia Flynn in &quot;Timeless&quot;, both NBC television series. For &quot;ER&quot;, he and the cast were nominated for two Screen Actors Guild Awards.

==Early life==
Višnjić was born on 9 September 1972 in Šibenik, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia. He has one sibling, an elder brother, Joško. His father, Željko, was a bus driver, and his mother, Milka, worked in a market. He appeared in plays throughout his childhood and made his screen debut at the age of 16 in the controversial Yugoslav film, &quot;Braća po materi&quot; (1988), playing a young Ustaša.

In 1990, at the age of 18, Višnjić served one-year of obligatory military service in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army as a paratrooper. Only weeks after his military discharge in 1991, as Yugoslavia began to dissolve, he joined the nascent Croatian Ground Army. After leaving the army, he moved to Zagreb to study at the Academy of Dramatic Art.

==Career==
Višnjić was the youngest actor to be chosen for the title role in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Dubrovnik Summer Festival. Originally cast as Laertes and understudy to Hamlet, he took over the role when the star dropped out of the production shortly before the first performance. He portrayed the doomed prince from 1994 to 2000, winning three national awards. During an episode of &quot;ER&quot;, he demonstrated his expertise in the part of Hamlet, by reciting an excerpt from the &quot;To be, or not to be&quot; soliloquy in Croatian.

Prior to &quot;ER&quot;, he found work in local television productions and landed a Tuborg beer commercial that aired in Europe. Višnjić also had small speaking roles in films such as &quot;The Peacemaker&quot;, &quot;Practical Magic&quot; and &quot;Committed&quot;. In 1998, he appeared in Madonna&#x27;s music video &quot;The Power of Good-Bye,&quot; and had a cameo in the film &quot;Rounders&quot;. It was his role as Risto, the Bosnian driver in &quot;Welcome to Sarajevo&quot; that led then-producer John Wells to offer him a role as a doctor to replace the departing George Clooney in the sixth season of &quot;ER&quot; in late 1999, eventually becoming the show&#x27;s male lead by the start of season 12, having taken over from the departing star Noah Wyle, who left after the finale of season 11. By season 14, however, he was only making a limited number of appearances, before completely leaving the show early in season 15.

While starring on &quot;ER&quot;, Višnjić worked on other projects. He co-starred in &quot;The Deep End&quot;; starred in and co-produced &quot;Posljednja volja&quot;; voiced Soto in &quot;Ice Age&quot; and starred in &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot;, alongside Shirley Henderson and Miranda Otto. In 2004, he starred in the television miniseries &quot;Spartacus&quot; and the film &quot;Duga mračna noć&quot;. He next appeared with Jennifer Garner in &quot;Elektra&quot;. In 2005, Višnjić was one of the four finalists for the role of James Bond, eventually losing out to British actor Daniel Craig, with whom he would appear in &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;.

In 2009, Višnjić appeared alongside Carla Gugino in a segment of the film &quot;New York, I Love You&quot;, an anthology set in New York. Višnjić&#x27;s segment &quot;Apocrypha&quot; was directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev. The segment was cut from the theatrical release of the film but was included in the DVD version. He next starred in &quot;Helen&quot;, alongside Ashley Judd as Judd&#x27;s character&#x27;s husband David, which made its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.

Višnjić appeared in &quot;The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler&quot;, about a young Polish woman who saved the lives of many Jewish children in wartime Warsaw, filmed in Riga, Latvia. It was produced for &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; and aired on CBS on 19 April 2009. He completed a role in Mike Mills&#x27; independent film, &quot;Beginners&quot;. In late 2009, he was cast as Samson in &quot;The Deep&quot;, shown on BBC One in 2010.

He appeared as Andrija Hebrang in the television miniseries &quot;Tito&quot;. He later appeared in the unsold pilot of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Boston&#x27;s Finest&quot;, playing a disgraced cop who works with a female officer to solve crimes while trying to clear his name. He also appeared in the two-episode season three finale of the television series &quot;Leverage&quot;, as international crime financier Damien Moreau, his first guest appearance on an English-language television program.

In 2011, he played Dragan Armansky, the head of a security agency, in &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot; and he has signed on to play this role for the entire film trilogy produced and distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment. He was featured on a four-episode arc of the television series &quot;Pan Am&quot;; he played a Yugoslavian attaché to the United Nations.

In 2014, Višnjić played John Woods, the husband of Molly Woods, in &quot;Extant&quot;, produced by Steven Spielberg. Although the series was renewed in late 2014, he left the series early in the second season.

From 2016 to 2018, he played former NSA asset Garcia Flynn in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Timeless&quot;.

In 2019, Višnjić portrayed Ante Gotovina in the Antun Vrdoljak-directed film &quot;General&quot;. His performance, along with the film itself gained overwhelmingly negative reviews with many critics, including Milivoj Jukić and Jurica Pavičić calling his portrayal &quot;the worst performance of his career.&quot; The critically and commercially panned film was screened at the Pula Film Festival.

Višnjić played Nikola Tesla in the twelfth series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, appearing in the fourth episode, &quot;Nikola Tesla&#x27;s Night of Terror,&quot; first broadcast on 19 January 2020.

In early 2020, Višnjić was cast as Count Dracula in the unsold ABC pilot &quot;The Brides&quot;, which was written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa.

In 2024, Višnjić returned to the stage starring opposite Zrinka Cvitešić and Goran Grgić in Ivo Vojnović&#x27;s &quot;Ekvinocijo&quot;, directed by Krešimir Dolenčić at the Dubrovnik Summer Festival. He also appeared in the final season of &quot;&quot; as Erik the Red.

Višnjić was named &quot;People&quot;″s Sexiest Import in 1999 and &quot;One of TV&#x27;s Sexiest Men&quot; in the June 5–11, 2005 &quot;TV Guide&quot;. He was ranked #18 in &quot;Hollywood&quot; in &quot;Best Croatian Male Movie Stars of All Time&quot; list in November 2005. He was also named as the Best Croatian Actor in 2004 for his role in the movie &quot;Duga mračna noć&quot;, according to the votes of &quot;Večernji list&quot;.

<doc id="478373" wikidata="Q494744" url="?curid=478373" title="Fiat 124">
<text>The Fiat 124 is a small family car manufactured and marketed by Italian company Fiat between 1966 and 1974. The saloon superseded the Fiat 1300 and spawned station wagon, four-seater coupé (124 Sport Coupé), and two-seater convertible (124 Sport Spider) variants.

Fiat licensed numerous variants of the 124 for worldwide manufacture, including the Russian-built VAZ-2101 &quot;Zhiguli&quot; and its many derivatives. Known as the Lada outside the Soviet Union, these Russian variants constituted the vast majority of 124 derived production, making it the fifth best selling automotive platform in history.

The 124 was superseded in its home market by the Fiat 131, launched in 1974.

==History==
As a clean-sheet design by Oscar Montabone, the chief engineer responsible for its development, the 124 used only the all-synchromesh gear box from the Fiat 1500. The 124 featured a spacious interior, advanced coil spring rear suspension, disc brakes on all wheels and lightweight construction.

A 5-door station wagon variant (named 124 Familiare on its home market) as well as the 124 Sport Spider variants debuted at the 48th Turin Motor show in November 1966. A few months later, at the March 1967 Geneva Motor Show, the 124 Sport Coupé completed the range. The two Sport models were powered by an all-new 1.4-litre dual overhead camshaft engine producing at 6,500 rpm.

Following its introduction in 1966 with a publicity stunt, where a 124 was dropped by parachute from a plane, the 124 won the 1967 European Car of the Year award.

===The 124 Special===
In October 1968, Fiat launched the 124 Special; like Fiat&#x27;s other Special models, it was an upmarket, better appointed and higher performance variant of the standard saloon. A month after, in November, it was displayed at the 50th Turin Motor Show alongside its larger sibling, the new 125 Special.
In addition to a 1.4-litre overhead valve engine, the 124 Special notably introduced all-new 5-link (four longitudinal, one transverse) solid axle rear suspension in place of the original 3-link design. Starting from late 1968 the same improved rear axle was adopted by both Sport models.

In detail the Special&#x27;s 1,438 cc type &quot;124 A2&quot; engine had the same bore and stroke of the Sport Coupé and Sport Spider engines (80 × 71.5 mm), but eschewed the dual overhead camshafts of the two sportscars in favour of the more conventional overhead valve setup from the 124 saloon. With a downdraught (instead of the 1.2&#x27;s sidedraught) twin-choke Weber 32 DHS or Solex C32 EIES carburettor and a 9.0:1 compression ratio, engine output was at 5,400 rpm and of torque at 3,300 rpm. Fiat advertised a top speed of over . Besides engine and rear axle, notable mechanical changes from the regular 124 were an alternator replacing the dynamo, an uprated clutch, standard 155R13 Pirelli Cinturato radial tyres, and the addition of a vacuum servo to the all-disc braking system.

Visually the Special could be immediately distinguished from the standard model by its new, rectangular grille with four inset round headlamps. Less evident differences were larger vertical bumper over-riders, wheels with round ventilation holes as on the Sport models, new flush door handles, different tail lamps with integrated reflectors, and a central back-up light. The interior featured a redesigned padded dashboard with an oval binnacle housing two round instruments and a car radio console, a steering wheel without horn ring, new door cards, and more supportive seats.

===1970 revisions and the 124 Special T===

At the November 1970 Turin Motor Show, Fiat introduced a round of updates for the entire saloon and estate 124 range, as well as a new model variant—the 124 Special T.
All models had gained air outlets added to the C-pillar for better ventilation, and a split brake circuit; while some features previously exclusive to the 124 Special such as servo-assisted brakes, back-up light and an alternator were made standard across the range. &quot;Berlina&quot; and &quot;Familiare&quot; both had a new grille with alternated chrome and black horizontal bars, and larger bumper over-riders. Additionally the &quot;Berlina&quot; had large, nearly square tail lamps made up by two stacked rectangular elements.

The renewed Special sported a completely redesigned front end. A black, square-mesh radiator grille was crossed by a horizontal bright bar joining the dual headlamps; each of the four round lamps was set in its own square, bright-edged housing. The grille-headlamps assembly was flanked by the turn indicators. Front and rear the bumpers had lost their over-riders, replaced by full-width rubber strips. At the rear the lamps were also new—still horizontal and rectangular in shape unlike the ones used on the standard saloon—and the whole tail panel was surrounded by a chromed profile.
Inside there was a new dashboard with imitation wood inserts, carpets instead of rubber mats, and cloth upholstery.
The &quot;T&quot; in 124 Special T stood for &quot;twin cam&quot;, hinting at the car&#x27;s 1,438 cc dual overhead camshaft engine, derived from the Sport Coupé and Spider but in a milder state of tune. Coded &quot;124 AC.300&quot;, this engine had revised valve timing and fuel system and produced at 5,800 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. According to the manufacturer top speed was . Externally the Special T was identical to the Special, save for model badging at the rear.

==Engines==
Power came from a 1.2 L (1,197 cc) Fiat OHV inline-four engine. Also, there were the 124 Special with a 1,438 cc OHV engine and the 124 Special T with 1,438 cc and 1,592 cc twin cam OHC engines. The twin cams are connected to a four-speed and five-speed gearbox.

==Foreign production==
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Fiat sought to extend its worldwide reach by licensing the 124 design following its discontinuation in mainstream Western European markets, including the widely known and most produced derivative, the Russian-built Lada, which sold over 15 million units.

===Soviet Union/Russia===
In 1966, Fiat entered into a collaborative agreement with the Soviet government to establish car manufacture in the Samara region of Russia. Fiat was contracted to take part in the creation of the massive VAZ plant in the newly created town of Togliatti, named after the Italian communist leader of the same name. The factory produced an adapted version 124R of the 124, known as the VAZ-2101 &quot;Zhiguli&quot; (sold as the Lada 1200/1300 in export markets), until 1982, and 1200s until 1987. Based on the 124, they were modified at more than 800 points, the major modifications having an entirely different OHC engine, hydraulic clutch, drum brakes at the rear, modified suspensions, etc. Early modifications include the VAZ-2102 (station wagon), 2103 (Lada 1500), 2106 (Lada 1600) and 21011 (Lada 1300). The updated and restyled versions of the 124-based design were produced until September 2012, as the VAZ-2104, 2105 and 2107 – marketed as the Lada Riva in UK markets. Production of this line reached 17,332,954 cars, this being the second largest production volume for a car in automotive history.

=== India===

The Fiat 124 was also introduced in India by Premier Automobiles Limited. In 1981 Premier began the process of acquiring the production tooling for the facelifted SEAT 124 D after authorisation from Fiat. The model was released in the autumn of 1985 as the Premier 118NE. The car was very similar to the 1966 version except for a few cosmetic changes to the front and rear. However, Premier incorporated the Nissan A12 (1,171 cc and 52 bhp) powertrain instead of the original Fiat engine along with a Nissan manual gearbox. Added in 1996, there was also a version called the 1.38D which sported a diesel engine, built under license from Fratelli Negri Macchine Diesel Sud of Italy.

Near the end of production an improved model called &quot;Viceroy&quot; was released in collaboration with Peugeot. Production ended in 2001.

===Malaysia===
The 124 was also built at the Kilang Pembena Kereta-Kereta (KPKK) factory in Tampoi, Johor, since the latter half of 1967. The cars were distributed by Sharikat Fiat Distributors. Originally only available with the 1.2-liter engine with , in late 1969 the sportier 124 Special joined the lineup. This version has twin headlamps, and the larger, pushrod 1.4-liter engine with . In late 1971, about a year after its introduction in Italy, the twin-cam 124 Special T also joined the Malaysian production line.

===Spain===

In the frame of the licence agreement between SEAT and Fiat, it was produced and sold in Spain with the name SEAT 124 from 1968 to 1975. Also a clone from the 124 Special with some elements from Fiat 125 was produced from 1969 to 1975 with the 1438 cc engine along with the twin-cams known as the &quot;FUs&quot; 1,600 cc (1970–72), and 1,800 cc (1972–75) branded as SEAT 1430. In 1975 when Fiat stopped production of the Fiat 124, the SEAT 124 had a minor facelift done by Giorgetto Giugiaro changing the aesthetics of the car by changing the round headlamps to rectangular design and integrating taillights into the body, car was known as the SEAT 124D and remained in production until 1980 with the Sport versions now codenamed the &quot;FLs&quot;, FL-40/45 1,600 cc 90HP, FL-80/82 1,800 cc 114HP and FL-90 1,919 cc 114HP
The car was very successful in Spain, and was sold in both the four-door and station wagon versions.

===Bulgaria===
The Fiat 124 was also produced under the name Pirin-Fiat in Lovech, Bulgaria, on the basis of complete knockdown (CKD) kits between 1967 and 1971.

===Turkey===

The Fiat 124 was also produced by Tofaş under the names &quot;&quot;Murat 124&quot; between 1971-1977 and &quot;Serçe&quot;&quot; (&quot;sparrow&quot; in Turkish) between 1984 and 1994, in Bursa, Turkey. 134,867 Murat 124s were produced between 1971 and 1994. Tofaş concurrently produced the Fiat 131 series under the name Murat 131 between 1976 and 2002. Today, the company manufactures bona fide Fiat models.

===Korea===
The Fiat 124 was also produced under the name Fiat-KIA 124 by Asia Motors in South Korea, between 1970 and 1975. In total 6775 units were assembled.

===Egypt===
From 2002 to 2007, Lada-Egypt company built at least 9,000 cars (2,200 in 2006) in the shell of VAZ-2107 (Riva), and it continues in 2012.
==124 Cabriolet==
At Salone dell&#x27;Automobile of Torino in 1966, Carrozzeria Touring presented a convertible version of Fiat 124 saloon. It was the last car built by Touring. Only one example was made. Reactions were positive, but the Fiat CEO terminated this project in favour of the Pininfarina-styled 124 Sport Spider.

==Fiat ESV 2500==
The ESV 2500 is an Experimental Safety Vehicle that Fiat developed in 1972 based on its 124 model. It had a totally new 5-door three-box design, with an extra strong passenger cell, but used the mechanicals of the standard 124 with 1438 cm3 engine. The ESV 2500&#x27;s weight was 43 % higher than that of the original 124.

<text>The Lada / VAZ-2105, 2104 and 2107, collectively marketed as Lada Riva for right-hand drive models (in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand), the Lada Nova in Germany, and by multiple other names and markets, are a series of compact sedans of the &quot;Zhiguli&quot; line-up (Fiat 124-based cars), built by Russian car manufacturer AvtoVAZ (formerly VAZ). Introduced in 1979 in the Soviet Union, and progressively introduced to Western European and global markets from the early 1980s, under the Lada brand, they were sold as saloons (2105 and 2107), and station wagon (2104) versions.

Today they are generally referred to as the Lada Classic series, being derived from the original Fiat 124 platform which has been the now-iconic mainstay of the AvtoVAZ lineup since the company&#x27;s foundation in the late 1960s. Russian production at the company&#x27;s main plant at Togliatti ended in September 2012.

Along with the other Fiat 124 derivatives, it is the world&#x27;s third best selling, single generation automobile platform, after the Volkswagen Beetle and the Ford Model T, and one of the longest production run platforms alongside the Volkswagen Beetle, the Hindustan Ambassador, the Volkswagen (Type 2) Bus, the Toyota 70 Series, and the Mercedes-Benz G-Class.

==History==

Although introduced in 1979 and first produced in quantity in 1980, the Riva&#x27;s origins are older: it is a modernised and restyled version of the original Lada type VAZ-2101 &quot;Zhiguli&quot; saloon, which was introduced in 1970 as a modified license copy of the Fiat 124. VAZ began development work on the facelift version as early as 1975, and the first prototypes were built in 1977, although it would not be until 1983 – three years after its release in the Soviet Union – that the car was made available in Western European markets, and like its predecessors - aimed squarely at the budget end of the market.

The Riva itself is officially designated – and known in the home market – as VAZ-2105 (base saloon [sedan]), VAZ-2104 (station wagon), and VAZ-2107 (deluxe saloon identified by the large chromed grille). In Russia, VAZ-2105, VAZ-2104, and VAZ-2107 are considered to be different cars rather than variants but nonetheless all of them are part of a single &quot;Klassika&quot; (&quot;Classic&quot;) family along with older models such as the VAZ-2101. They are popularly known as Pyatyorka (&quot;the five&quot;), Chetvyorka (&quot;the four&quot;) and Semyorka (&quot;the seven&quot;). 

Mechanically, the car is virtually identical to the first-generation VAZ-2101, featuring the Fiat-derived manual transmissions, coil spring suspension all round, and aluminium alloy drum brakes with cast iron brake shoes on the rear wheels. The smaller-engined variant, the version (VAZ-2105) had a revamp of its inline four-cylinder compared to the original VAZ-2101 (Lada 1200). The old OHC design had its camshaft driven by chain, while the new one had a toothed belt drive. Some modifications of the Riva&#x27;s larger-engined version (VAZ-2107) carried on with the chain-driven OHC engine coming over from the original Lada 1500 (VAZ-2103), while others had a later 1,6L VAZ-2106/21067 engine. Another change was made to the engine in 1992, when single point fuel injection and catalytic converters were specified to keep up with emissions legislation.

The 2107 was announced in 1982, offered as the luxury version (and the most expensive), with improved interior (including front headrests), a new instrument panel, and a chrome grille; it came with either (21072) or (21074) engines. (The 21079 was a Wankel engined version.)

The first 2104 station wagon appeared in 1984, in three models: the 2104 with ; the 21041 with ; and the 21043 with (VAZ-2103) engine.

Export sales proved to be very good in Eastern Europe. In the West, Rivas had limited presence in such countries as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, New Zealand (where it served as a taxi), and Canada. In Finland, they had much larger sales due to the fact that Finland had closer economic ties with the Soviet Union. Canada was the only market to offer whitewall tires. Canadian 2107s were &quot;briefly sold as the Dennis Signet&quot;, after the importer, Peter Dennis Motor Corporation. Canadian sales, along with several European markets, ended on 4 July 1997.

Tightening safety and emissions legislation combined with the economic instability in the former Soviet Union during the 1990s led to the Riva being withdrawn from most Western European markets by 1997, although it remained in production at the AvtoVAZ factory in the Russian Federation and was sold as the Lada Classic. It was one of the cheapest automobiles available in the Russian market and remains the most popular second-hand car in Russia even after its production ceased.

In 2002, production of the wagon model was taken over by Izh, before assembly was also started at the Bogdan Group&#x27;s LuAZ plant, and later in Cherkasy, Ukraine. The 2107 model was produced also at the ZAZ factory in Ukraine and at Suzuki&#x27;s factory in Egypt. In August 2011, Russian production of the 2107 was moved to Izh. After about thirty years of production, the 2105 was discontinued in 2010, followed by the 2104 and 2107 in 2012.

===United Kingdom===
The British market was opened with the 1300GL in 1983, and the 21051 (Riva 1200L) had the . British sales were based heavily on low sales price and durability. In 1986, 20,000 Ladas were sold in Britain, 30,000 in 1988. British imports of the older VAZ-2101/2102/2106 ended soon after the Riva&#x27;s introduction, although they remained available in the Soviet Union and much of the old Eastern Bloc for several years afterwards.

In a review of the new economy car, the British automobile magazine &quot;Autocar&quot; noted its low price of only £3,158 (£10,736.82 in 2020), improved road performance and an &quot;impressive list of standard equipment&quot;, which included &quot;height-adjustable headlamps, internally adjustable driver&#x27;s door mirror, velour-covered seats, heated rear window, illumination lights for bonnet and boot&quot;, and a 21-piece toolkit. However, its spartan interiors and ageing design meant that it was never aimed at buyers of market leaders&#x27; similar-sized but more expensive products, such as the Ford Sierra, Vauxhall Cavalier and Austin Montego. Nonetheless, the Riva was still selling well in the United Kingdom and many other Western markets in the early 1990s, but the next few years saw a raft of new models come from budget competitors such as Daewoo, Hyundai, Kia and Proton, pushing Riva sales into terminal decline. This, combined with the economic hardships and much-needed investment to adapt cars to stricter European Union emissions requirements not being available, resulted in the decision to withdraw Lada from the UK (and some other European markets) and Canada on 4 July 1997. They had cheaply tried to produce catalytic converter equipped cars (EU mandated from 1992) using carburettors, when all other car makers changed to fuel injection to more accurately control fuel/air ratios. However the catalysts were quickly destroyed as a result and most cars failed their first MOT test (at three years old) as a result.

Despite Lada&#x27;s withdrawal in 1997 from the British market, most of the surviving Rivas on UK roads were not scrapped; rather the vast majority were re-exported back to Russia due to a shortage of used examples in their homeland and the export specification was considered superior to those that were available domestically. Even in 2021, many ex-UK right hand drive Rivas are still operating in Russia and the former Soviet states.

===New Zealand===
The car was also sold in New Zealand, where it was distributed by the New Zealand Dairy Board. The Dairy Board received the cars in lieu of cash payments for deliveries of mutton and butter to the Soviet Union. The last such trade was carried out in 1990.

==Other variants==

Small numbers of Lada rally cars were built with Wankel engines, fitted with a pair of Weber DCOE twin-choke carburettors.

===Production at Suzuki Egypt===
In Egypt, the Amal Foreign Trade Company and Lada&#x27;s parent company AvtoVAZ signed a joint venture agreement to assemble Ladas for the North African market in 2000. However, as they did not have their own factory, space was found at a local Suzuki plant in Cairo to assemble the 2107 version of the Riva. As of 2006, production continued at Suzuki until 2015 with an additional model, the 2110, being produced.

==Safety==
In the early 1980s, when it was put into production, the car complied with UNECE car safety standards and GOST technical standards.

In 2001, the 2107 version of the Riva scored 0 points out of 16 in a frontal crash test conducted by the modern Russian ARCAP safety assessment program, and was awarded zero stars out of four. The reviewers noted that the result of the test was easily predictable and couldn&#x27;t be positive, as they were dealing with an old car having an outdated construction of the body and designed at the time when safety tests were different from those of 2001.

In 2002 Za Rulyom magazine performed crash tests on two Lada 21053 models, a new car from 2002 and a used one from 1994. The magazine&#x27;s experts noted that the newer model complied with UNECE car safety standards 12-03 and 33, but the older and used one failed the latter standard. The story also expressed doubt that the 2002 model could meet the stricter safety requirements that would be imposed in October of the same year.

==End of production==
In the 2010s, the sales of the Lada Classics remained strong in the car&#x27;s native Russia and some of the former Eastern Bloc nations. However, production of the 2105 ceased at AvtoVAZ&#x27;s Togliatti plant at the end of 2010 after a 30-year production run and nearly 3,000,000 units, with production of the other variants being fully moved to the IzhAvto plant near Izhevsk.

The 2107 made the transition to the IzhAvto plant in August 2011, thus marking the end of production of the original Fiat 124 derived models at Togliatti after a 41-year production run and over 14 million units.

In September 2012, the history of the sedan model in Russia was over, when the last 2104 came off the IzhAvto assembly lines. The last unit of the Lada Classic series, a 2104 model, was produced by IzhAvto on 17 September 2012. Starting from the same month, production at the Izhevsk factory was replaced with the Lada Granta. However, , the 2107 model was still in production in Egypt.
