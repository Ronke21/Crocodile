<text>Eric Clifford Ambler OBE (28 June 1909 – 23 October 1998) was an English author of thrillers, in particular spy novels, who introduced a new realism to the genre. Also working as a screenwriter, Ambler used the pseudonym Eliot Reed for books written with Charles Rodda.

==Life==
Ambler was born in Charlton, South-East London, into a family of entertainers who ran a puppet show, with which he helped in his early years. Both parents also worked as music hall artists. He later studied engineering at the Northampton Polytechnic Institute in Islington (now City, University of London) and served a traineeship with an engineering company. However, his upbringing as an entertainer proved dominant and he soon moved to writing plays and other works. By the early 1930s, he was a copywriter at an advertising agency in London. After resigning, he moved to Paris, where he met and in 1939 married Louise Crombie, an American fashion correspondent.

Ambler was then politically a staunch antifascist and, like many others, tended to regard the Soviet Union as the only real counterweight to fascist aggression, which was reflected in the fact that some of his early books included Soviet agents depicted positively and as sympathetic characters, the undoubted allies of the protagonist.

Like numerous like-minded people in different countries, Ambler was shocked and disillusioned by the German–Soviet Pact of 1939. His postwar anticommunist novel &quot;Judgment on Deltchev&quot; (1951), based on the Stalinist purge trials in Eastern Europe, caused him to be reviled by many former Communist Party and other progressive associates.
When the Second World War broke out, Ambler entered the army as a private soldier. He was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1941. He was soon reassigned to photographic units. He ended the war as a lieutenant-colonel and an assistant director of the Army Film and Photographic Unit.

After the war, he worked in the civilian film industry as a screenwriter, receiving an Academy Award nomination for his work on the film &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1953), adapted from the novel by Nicholas Monsarrat. He did not resume writing under his own name until 1951, when he entered the second of his two distinct periods in his writing. He was elected to the Detection Club in 1952, the first member to primarily write thrillers rather than traditional Golden Age detective novels.

Five of his six early works are regarded as classic thrillers. He created the 1960 American detective TV series &quot;Checkmate&quot;.

Ambler divorced Crombie in May 1958 and married the same year British-born Joan Harrison, a film producer, screenwriter and associate of Alfred and Alma Hitchcock. The couple moved to Switzerland in 1969 and back to Britain 16 years later. Harrison died in 1994 in London. Ambler died in London on 23 October 1998.

In 2008, his estate transferred all of Ambler&#x27;s copyrights and other legal and commercial rights to Owatonna Media, which sold the copyrights to Coolabi Plc in 2009 but retained a master licence in radio and audio rights. These rights are commercially licensed in the UK and abroad.

== Writing career==

Ambler&#x27;s best-known works are probably &quot;The Mask of Dimitrios&quot; (1939) (published in the US under the title &quot;A Coffin for Dimitrios&quot;), which was made into a film in 1944, and &quot;The Light of Day&quot; (1962), filmed in 1964 as &quot;Topkapi&quot;. He was also a successful screenwriter and lived in Los Angeles in his later years. Other classic movies based on his work include &quot;Journey into Fear&quot; (1943), starring Joseph Cotten, and an original screenplay, &quot;The October Man&quot; (1947). He wrote the screenplay for &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; about the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, along with many other screenplays, particularly those concerning stories and adventures at sea. He published his autobiography in 1985, &quot;Here Lies&quot;.

In contrast to most other spy novels published before his, the protagonists in Ambler&#x27;s novels are rarely professional spies, policemen or counterintelligence operatives. They are usually amateurs who find themselves unwillingly in the company of hardened criminals, revolutionaries or spies. The protagonist usually begins out of his depth, but nonetheless eventually manages to surprise himself as well as the professionals with decisive actions that outwit his far more experienced opponents.

That plot is used, for example, in &quot;Journey into Fear&quot;, &quot;Epitaph for a Spy&quot;, &quot;The Mask of Dimitrios&quot;, &quot;The Night-Comers&quot;/&quot;State of Siege&quot;, &quot;Passage of Arms&quot;, &quot;The Light of Day&quot;, &quot;Dirty Story&quot;, &quot;The Levanter&quot; and &quot;Doctor Frigo&quot;.

Another recurring plot element is statelessness and exile: characters who are exiled from their homelands or who face the danger of being exiled and not granted residence in any country.

==Reception and influence==
Many authors of international thrillers have acknowledged a debt to Ambler, including Graham Greene, Ian Fleming, John le Carré, Julian Symons, Alan Furst and Frederick Forsyth.

<doc id="486384" wikidata="Q4690724" url="?curid=486384" title="Plasma afterglow">
<text>A plasma afterglow (also afterglow) is the radiation emitted from a plasma after the source of ionization is removed.
The external electromagnetic fields that sustained the plasma glow are absent or insufficient to maintain the discharge in the afterglow. A plasma afterglow can either be a temporal, due to an interrupted (pulsed) plasma source, or spatial, due to a distant plasma source. In the afterglow, plasma-generated species de-excite and participate in secondary chemical reactions that tend to form stable species. Depending on the gas composition, super-elastic collisions may continue to sustain the plasma in the afterglow for a while by releasing the energy stored in rovibronic degrees of freedom of the atoms and molecules of the plasma. Especially in molecular gases, the plasma chemistry in the afterglow is significantly different from the plasma glow. The afterglow of a plasma is still a plasma and as thus retains most of the properties of a plasma.

== History ==
The first published pictures of plasma afterglow were taken in 1953.

Helium afterglow, one of the most commonly used forms of afterglow, was first described in 1963 by Arthur L. Schmeltekopf Jr. and H. P. Broida.

The first flowing afterglow ionization studies began in the early 1960s in an effort to understand atmospheric ion chemistry. At the time stationary afterglow studies had already been done however this approach was limited by lack of versatility and lacked consistency as studies done prior to 1964 showed common atmospheric reactions to have drastically differing reaction rates between studies. Flowing-afterglow was then used to more precisely describe the rate constants of common atmospheric reactions

== Remote plasma ==

A remote plasma refers to a plasma that is spatially separated from the external electromagnetic fields that initiate the discharge. An afterglow is a remote plasma if the plasma is channeled away from the original plasma source.

An advantage that remote plasma has over temporal plasma is that remote plasma can be used as a continuous plasma source and thus has more applications in supplying reagent ions for most systems.

Remote plasmas are often used in the field of analytical chemistry when a constant stream of ions is required. They are also very commonly used a method of cleaning complex vacuum systems without having to take them apart.

== Temporal plasma ==
A temporal plasma refers to an afterglow from a plasma source that is time delineated. Removing the source of excitation allows for an afterglow to be present in the same space that the initial plasma was excited for a short time.

An advantage that temporal plasma has over remote plasma is that it can be contained in a closed system and thus makes controlling the temperature and pressure is easier.

Temporal plasma is often used to replicate ionic reactions in atmospheric conditions in a controlled environment.

== Applications ==

=== Flowing afterglow ===

A flowing afterglow is an ion source that is used to create ions in a flow of inert gas, typically helium or argon. Flowing afterglow ion sources usually consist of a dielectric discharge that gases are channeled through to be excited and thus made into plasma. Flowing afterglow ion sources can be coupled with a selected-ion flow-tube for selection of reactant ions. When this ion source is coupled with mass spectrometry it is referred to as flowing afterglow mass spectrometry.

Flowing-afterglow mass spectrometry uses a flowing afterglow to create protonated water cluster ions in a helium or argon carrier gas in a flow tube that react with sample molecules that are measured by a mass spectrometer downstream. These systems can be used for trace gas analysis. This works by keeping the initial ionization source spatially separated from the target analyte and channeling the afterglow of the initial ionization towards the analyte. Analytes are added downstream to create ion products. Ions Detection of ions is usually accomplished using a mass spectrometer or by optical spectroscopy.

=== Stationary afterglow ===
Stationary afterglow (SA) is a technique for studying remote plasma that consist of a gaseous mixture inside a bulb that is subjected to an ionizing pulse. After said ionizing pulse the ion composition of the mixture is measured as a function of time at the wall of the containing bulb. Stationary afterglow methods are often used to study atmospheric reactions as they mimic atmospheric conditions in a controlled environment.

=== Cleaning and sterilization ===
Plasma afterglow has shown to be an effective means of cleaning and sterilizing difficult to take apart machinery and glassware. Plasma cleaning uses remote plasma sources to generate an afterglow that is ventilated into the system to be cleaned and then the afterglow ions react with the contaminants. When oxygen is used as the carrier gas, ionized oxygen species react with heavier organic compounds to form H2O, CO2, and CO. These products are then easily vented from the system effectively removing organic contaminants from the system. This provides the advantage of not having to take systems apart and thus saves time on disassembly and on vacuum systems it saves time changing the pressure of the system.

This plasma cleaning method is especially effective for chemical vapor deposition methods where cleanliness is a key part of productivity.

<text>In the resonator mode, the plasma density does not exceed the 
critical density. 
A standing electromagnetic wave, which is confined by a
resonator cavity, penetrates the plasma and sustains it in the regions of highest field
intensity. The geometry of this region determines the spatial distribution of the plasma. Plasmas excited in resonator mode are less resistant against detuning, for instance by the insertion of electric probes (Langmuir probes) or electrically conducting samples compared
to surface-wave plasmas. There, the high plasma density better shields disturbing potentials.</text><links>

<doc id="486395" wikidata="Q10458" url="?curid=486395" title="Würzburg (district)">
<text>Würzburg is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the northwestern part of Bavaria, Germany.
Neighboring districts are (from the north, clockwise) Main-Spessart, Schweinfurt, Kitzingen, Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim, and the district Main-Tauber in Baden-Württemberg. The city Würzburg is not part of the district, although it is completely enclosed by it.
==History==
In 1852, districts were created in the region, including the two precursor districts of Würzburg and Ochsenfurt. In 1972 the previous district Würzburg was merged with the former district Ochsenfurt, and several municipalities from the districts Marktheidenfeld, Karlstadt, Kitzingen and Gerolzhofen were added to form the district with today&#x27;s borders.

==Economy==
In 2017 (latest data available) the GDP per inhabitant was €28,681. This places the district 86th out of 96 districts (rural and urban) in Bavaria (overall average: €46,698).

==Partnerships==
The district has sister city-like partnerships with these regions:
* - Mateh Yehuda Regional Council, Israel
* - Olomouc Region, Czech Republic

==Coat of arms==
The district coat of arms might be described thus: Per fess in chief gules dancetty of three argent, in base per pale argent two lions passant guardant sable armed and langued of the first and azure a fleur-de-lis Or.

In chief (the upper part of the coat of arms) is the &quot;Franconian Rake&quot;, the symbol of the former Bishopric of Wurzburg. In base, on the dexter (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) side, the fleur-de-lis is the symbol of the St. Burkhard Abbey in Würzburg, while the lions on the sinister (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) side derive from the coat of arms of the former Ochsenfurt district.

<text>Pelageya Yakovlevna Polubarinova-Kochina (; – 3 July 1999) was a Soviet and Russian applied mathematician, known for her work on fluid mechanics and hydrodynamics, particularly, the application of Fuchsian equations, as well in the history of mathematics. She was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in 1946 and full member (academician) in 1958.

==Biography==

Born on in the Russian Empire to an accountant and a housewife, Pelageya was the second youngest of four children. She studied at a women&#x27;s high school in Saint Petersburg and went on to Petrograd University (after the Russian Revolution). After her father died in 1918, she started working at the laboratory of geophysics under the supervision of Alexander Friedmann. There she met Nikolai Kochin; they were married in 1925 and had two daughters. The two taught at Petrograd University until 1934, when they moved to Moscow, where Nikolai Kochin took a teaching position at the Moscow University. In Moscow, Polubarinova-Kochina did research at the Steklov Institute until World War II, when she and their daughters were evacuated to Kazan while Kochin stayed in Moscow to work on aiding the military effort. He died before the war was over.

After the war, she edited his lectures and continued to teach applied mathematics. She was later head of the department of theoretical mechanics at the University of Novosibirsk and director of the department of applied hydrodynamics at the Hydrodynamics Institute. She was one of the founders of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (then the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union) at Novosibirsk.

She was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1946, was made a Hero of Socialist Labour in 1969 and received the Order of Friendship of Peoples in 1979. She died in 1999, a few months after her 100th birthday, and shortly after publishing her last scientific article.

<doc id="486429" wikidata="Q244438" url="?curid=486429" title="Prosopagnosia">
<text>Prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, is a cognitive disorder of face perception in which the ability to recognize familiar faces, including one&#x27;s own face (self-recognition), is impaired, while other aspects of visual processing (e.g., object discrimination) and intellectual functioning (e.g., decision-making) remain intact. The term originally referred to a condition following acute brain damage (acquired prosopagnosia), but a congenital or developmental form of the disorder also exists, with a prevalence of 2.5%.

The brain area usually associated with prosopagnosia is the fusiform gyrus, which activates specifically in response to faces. The functionality of the fusiform gyrus allows most people to recognize faces in more detail than they do similarly complex inanimate objects. For those with prosopagnosia, the method for recognizing faces depends on the less sensitive object-recognition system. The right hemisphere fusiform gyrus is more often involved in familiar face recognition than the left. It remains unclear whether the fusiform gyrus is specific for the recognition of human faces or if it is also involved in highly trained visual stimuli. Prosopagnosic patients are under normal conditions able to recognize facial expressions and emotions.

Acquired prosopagnosia results from occipito-temporal lobe damage and is most often found in adults. It is subdivided into apperceptive and associative prosopagnosia. In congenital prosopagnosia, the individual never adequately develops the ability to recognize faces.

Though there have been several attempts at remediation, no therapies have demonstrated lasting improvements across a group of prosopagnosics. Prosopagnosics often learn to use &quot;piecemeal&quot; or &quot;feature-by-feature&quot; recognition strategies. This may involve secondary clues such as clothing, gait, hair color, skin color, body shape, and voice. Because the face seems to function as an important identifying feature in memory, it can also be difficult for people with this condition to keep track of information about people, and socialize normally with others. Prosopagnosia has also been associated with other disorders that are associated with nearby brain areas: left hemianopsia (loss of vision from left side of space, associated with damage to the right occipital lobe), achromatopsia (a deficit in color perception often associated with unilateral or bilateral lesions in the temporo-occipital junction) and topographical disorientation (a loss of environmental familiarity and difficulties in using landmarks, associated with lesions in the posterior part of the parahippocampal gyrus and anterior part of the lingual gyrus of the right hemisphere).

The opposite of prosopagnosia is the skill of superior face recognition ability. People with this ability are called &quot;super recognizers&quot;.

==Types==
=== Apperceptive ===
&quot;Apperceptive prosopagnosia&quot; has typically been used to describe cases of acquired prosopagnosia with some of the earliest processes in the face perception system. The brain areas thought to play a critical role in apperceptive prosopagnosia are right occipital temporal regions. People with this disorder cannot make any sense of faces and are unable to make same–different judgments when they are presented with pictures of different faces. They are unable to recognize both familiar and unfamiliar faces. In addition, apperceptive sub-types of prosopagnosia struggle recognizing facial emotion. However, they may be able to recognize people based on non-face clues such as their clothing, hairstyle, skin color, or voice. Apperceptive prosopagnosia is believed to be associated with impaired fusiform gyrus. Experiments on the formation of new face detectors in adults on face-like stimuli (learning to distinguish the faces of cats) indicate that such new detectors are formed not in the fusiform, but in the lingual gyrus.

=== Associative ===
&quot;Associative prosopagnosia&quot; has typically been used to describe cases of acquired prosopagnosia with spared perceptual processes but impaired links between early face perception processes and the semantic information humans hold about people in our memories. Right anterior temporal regions may also play a critical role in associative prosopagnosia. People with this form of the disorder may be able to tell whether photos of people&#x27;s faces are the same or different and derive the age and sex from a face (suggesting they can make sense of some face information) but may not be able to subsequently identify the person or provide any information about them such as their name, occupation, or when they were last encountered. Associative prosopagnosia is thought to be due to impaired functioning of the parahippocampal gyrus.

=== Developmental ===
&quot;Developmental prosopagnosia&quot; (DP), also called &quot;congenital prosopagnosia&quot; (CP), is a face-recognition deficit that is lifelong, manifesting in early childhood, and that cannot be attributed to acquired brain damage. While developmental prosopagnosia begins early in life, many people do not realize that they have DP until later in their adult lives. A number of studies have found functional deficits in DP both on the basis of EEG measures and fMRI. It has been suggested that a genetic factor is responsible for the condition. The term &quot;hereditary prosopagnosia&quot; was introduced if DP affected more than one family member, essentially accenting the possible genetic contribution of this condition. To examine this possible genetic factor, 689 randomly selected students were administered a survey in which seventeen developmental prosopagnosics were quantifiably identified. Family members of fourteen of the DP individuals were interviewed to determine prosopagnosia-like characteristics, and in all fourteen families, at least one other affected family member was found. Individuals with congenital prosopagnosia have no mental images of faces, including of close relatives, but they may be able to recognize emotions. Under optimal conditions, recognition of facial expressions and emotions is normally preserved, though under more challenging conditions, it may exhibit subtle deficits.

In 2005, a study led by Ingo Kennerknecht showed support for the proposed congenital disorder form of prosopagnosia. This study provides epidemiological evidence that congenital prosopagnosia is a frequently occurring cognitive disorder that often runs in families. The analysis of pedigree trees formed within the study also indicates that the segregation pattern of hereditary prosopagnosia (HPA) is fully compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance. This mode of inheritance explains why HPA is so common among certain families (Kennerknecht et al. 2006).

== Cause ==
Prosopagnosia can be caused by lesions in various parts of the inferior occipital areas (occipital face area), fusiform gyrus (fusiform face area), and the anterior temporal cortex. Positron emission tomography (PET) and fMRI scans have shown that, in individuals without prosopagnosia, these areas are activated specifically in response to face stimuli. The inferior occipital areas are mainly involved in the early stages of face perception and the anterior temporal structures integrate specific information about the face, voice, and name of a familiar person.

Acquired prosopagnosia can develop as the result of several neurologically damaging causes. Vascular causes of prosopagnosia include posterior cerebral artery infarcts (PCAIs) and hemorrhages in the infero-medial part of the temporo-occipital area. These can be either bilateral or unilateral, but if they are unilateral, they are almost always in the right hemisphere. Recent studies have confirmed that right hemisphere damage to the specific temporo-occipital areas mentioned above is sufficient to induce prosopagnosia. MRI scans of patients with prosopagnosia showed lesions isolated to the right hemisphere, while fMRI scans showed that the left hemisphere was functioning normally. Unilateral left temporo-occipital lesions result in object agnosia, but spare face recognition processes, although a few cases have been documented where left unilateral damage resulted in prosopagnosia. It has been suggested that these face recognition impairments caused by left hemisphere damage are due to a semantic defect blocking retrieval processes that are involved in obtaining person-specific semantic information from the visual modality.

Other less common etiologies include carbon monoxide poisoning, temporal lobectomy, encephalitis, neoplasm, right temporal lobe atrophy, injury, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

== Diagnosis ==
There are few neuropsychological assessments that can definitively diagnose prosopagnosia. One commonly used test is the famous faces tests, where individuals are asked to recognize the faces of famous persons. However, this test is difficult to standardize. The Benton Facial Recognition Test (BFRT) is another test used by neuropsychologists to assess face recognition skills. Individuals are presented with a target face above six test faces and are asked to identify which test face matches the target face. The images are cropped to eliminate hair and clothes, as many people with prosopagnosia use hair and clothing cues to recognize faces. Both male and female faces are used during the test. For the first six items only one test face matches the target face; during the next seven items, three of the test faces match the target faces and the poses are different. The reliability of the BFRT was questioned when a study conducted by Duchaine and Nakayama showed that the average score for 11 self-reported prosopagnosics was within the normal range. One reason for this may be the way the test is designed. People with developmental prosopagnosia often use piecemeal strategies, which this test encourages by providing the target face to compare with possible matching faces. As the test increases in difficulty more and more facial features become obscured due to position and lighting, leading normal control subjects to rely on the exact same strategy of looking for individual features to match with the target face.

The test may be useful for identifying patients with apperceptive prosopagnosia, since this is mainly a matching test and they are unable to recognize both familiar and unfamiliar faces. They would be unable to pass the test. It would not be useful in diagnosing patients with associative prosopagnosia since they are able to match faces.

The Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) was developed by Duchaine and Nakayama to better diagnose people with prosopagnosia. This test initially presents individuals with three images each of six different target faces. They are then presented with many three-image series, which contain one image of a target face and two distracters. Duchaine and Nakayama showed that the CFMT is more accurate and efficient than previous tests in diagnosing patients with prosopagnosia. Their study compared the two tests and 75% of patients were diagnosed by the CFMT, while only 25% of patients were diagnosed by the BFRT. However, similar to the BFRT, patients are being asked to essentially match unfamiliar faces, as they are seen only briefly at the start of the test. The test is not widely used and will need further testing before it can be considered reliable.

The 20-item Prosopagnosia Index (PI20) is a freely available and validated self-report questionnaire that can be used alongside computer-based face recognition tests to help identify individuals with prosopagnosia. It has been validated using objective measures of face perception ability including famous face recognition tests and the Cambridge Face Memory Test. Less than 1.5% of the general population score above 65 on the PI20 and less than 65% on the CFMT.

==Treatment==
There are no widely accepted treatments.

== Prognosis ==
Management strategies for acquired prosopagnosia, such as a person who has difficulty recognizing people&#x27;s faces after a stroke, generally have a low rate of success. Acquired prosopagnosia sometimes spontaneously resolves.

== History ==
Selective inabilities to recognize faces were documented as early as the 19th century, and included case studies by Hughlings Jackson and Jean-Martin Charcot. However, it was not named until the term &quot;prosopagnosia&quot; was first used in 1947 by , a German neurologist. He described three cases, including a 24-year-old man who sustained a bullet wound to the head and lost his ability to recognize his friends, family, and even his own face. However, he was able to recognize and identify them through other sensory modalities such as auditory, tactile, and even other visual stimuli patterns (such as gait and other physical mannerisms). Bodamer gave his paper the title &quot;Die Prosop-Agnosie&quot;, derived from Classical Greek &quot;πρόσωπον&quot; (prósōpon) meaning &quot;face&quot; and &quot;αγνωσία&quot; (agnōsía) meaning &quot;non-knowledge&quot;. In October 1996, Bill Choisser began popularizing the term &quot;face blindness&quot; for this condition; the earliest-known use of the term is in an 1899 medical paper.

A case of a prosopagnosia is &quot;Dr P.&quot; in Oliver Sacks&#x27; 1985 book &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,&quot; though this is more properly considered to be one of a more general visual agnosia. Although Dr P. could not recognize his wife from her face, he was able to recognize her by her voice. His recognition of pictures of his family and friends appeared to be based on highly specific features, such as his brother&#x27;s square jaw and big teeth. Oliver Sacks himself had prosopagnosia, but did not know it for much of his life.

The study of prosopagnosia has been crucial in the development of theories of face perception. Because prosopagnosia is not a unitary disorder (i.e., different people may show different types and levels of impairment), it has been argued that face perception involves a number of stages, each of which can cause qualitative differences in impairment that different persons with prosopagnosia may exhibit.

This sort of evidence has been crucial in supporting the theory that there may be a specific face perception system in the brain. Most researchers agree that the facial perception process is holistic rather than featural, as it is for perception of most objects. A holistic perception of the face does not involve any explicit representation of local features (i.e., eyes, nose, mouth, etc.), but rather considers the face as a whole.

As the prototypical face has a specific spatial layout (eyes are always located above nose, and nose located above mouth), it is beneficial to use a holistic approach to recognize individual/specific faces from a group of similar layouts. This holistic processing of the face is exactly what is damaged in prosopagnosics. They are able to recognize the specific spatial layout and characteristics of facial features, but they are unable to process them as one entire face. This is counterintuitive to many people, as not everyone believes faces are &quot;special&quot; or perceived in a different way from other objects in the rest of the world. Though evidence suggests that other visual objects are processed in a holistic manner (e.g., dogs in dog experts), the size of these effects are smaller and are less consistently demonstrated than with faces. In a study conducted by Diamond and Carey, they showed this to be true by performing tests on dog-show judges. They showed pictures of dogs to the judges and to a control group and they then inverted those same pictures and showed them again. The dog-show judges had greater difficulty in recognizing the dogs once inverted compared to the control group; the inversion effect, the increased difficulty in recognizing a picture once inverted, was shown to be in effect. It was previously believed that the inversion effect was associated only with faces, but this study shows that it may apply to any category of expertise.

It has also been argued that prosopagnosia may be a general impairment in understanding how individual perceptual components make up the structure or gestalt of an object. Psychologist Martha Farah has been particularly associated with this view.

==Children==
Developmental prosopagnosia can be a difficult thing for a child to both understand and cope with. Many adults with developmental prosopagnosia report that for a long time they had no idea that they had a deficit in face processing, unaware that others could distinguish people solely on facial differences. Individuals with congenital prosopagnosia have no mental images of faces, even though they may be able to normally distinguish emotions.

Prosopagnosia in children may be overlooked; they may just appear to be very shy or slightly odd due to their inability to recognize faces. They may also have a hard time making friends, as they may not recognize their classmates. They often make friends with children who have very clear, distinguishing features. Children with prosopagnosia can have a particularly difficult time at school, as many school professionals are not well versed in prosopagnosia, if they are aware of the disorder at all. Recently, a database of children&#x27;s faces and test for child face perception has been developed, which may offer professionals a way to evaluate if a child has prosopagnosia.

Children with prosopagnosia may also have difficulties following the plots of television shows and movies, as they have trouble recognizing the different characters. They tend to gravitate towards animation, in which characters have simple but well-defined characteristics, tend to wear the same clothes, may have skin of strikingly different colours, and may even belong to different species. Prosopagnosic children even have a hard time telling family members apart, or recognizing people out of context (e.g., the teacher in a grocery store). Some have difficulty recognising themselves in group photographs.

Prosopagnosia particularly in children poses a special risk of danger, as the inability to accurately recognize familiar faces or the misidentification of strangers can put the child in an unsafe situation.

<doc id="486431" wikidata="Q478367" url="?curid=486431" title="Versus de scachis">
<text>&#x27; (Latin: &quot;Verses on Chess&quot;), also known as the Einsiedeln Poem&quot;&quot;&#x27; in some literature, is the title given to a 10th-century Medieval Latin poem about chess. It is the first known European text to provide a technical description of chess for didactic purposes and it is considered a fundamental document to understand the development of chess in Europe.

==Background==
It was found on two manuscripts (Codex Einsidlensis 365 and 319) from Einsiedeln Abbey Library (where they are also currently preserved) located in Einsiedeln, Canton of Schwyz, Switzerland and it was dated to about AD 1000. The dating of the document makes the poem the earliest known reference to chess in a European text, as well as the earliest known document to mention the chess queen (called in Latin), and the first reference to a bicolor board with dark and light colors (a pattern that was absent from boards in precursors such as Indian &quot;chaturanga&quot; and Perso-Arabic &quot;shatranj&quot;, both of which were single-color and were divided only by horizontal and vertical lines). 

The poem occupies both written sides of a sheet, and was only extracted in 1839 by the then abbey archivist Gall Morel (1803–1872) who combined it together with other loose sheets to form a composite volume, catalogued in the abbey archives as &quot;Einsiedeln 365&quot;. In 1877, professor and classical philologist Hermann Hagen (1844–1898) made the verses accessible to the general public in his medieval poetry compilation . In 1913, the English chess historian H. J. R. Murray (1868–1955) translated, printed, and interpreted the verses. However, it was not until 1954 that historian H.M. Gamer drew attention to their extraordinary historical importance. There exists, in addition, an early medieval copy (though not of the Codex Einsidlensis 365) of lines 65 to 98 with a somewhat more classical orthography, which is dated to 997 AD and is also preserved in the Einsiedeln Abbey Library.

The title of is from Codex Einsidlensis 365. The poem most likely dates to the 10th century. Gamer (1954) argues that the text in Codex Einsidlensis 365 might date to shortly before AD 1000, and the one in Codex Einsidlensis 319 dates to about the same time, or possibly to a few years after AD 1000. The text in Codex Einsidlensis 319 is incomplete, and entitled .

==Content==

The poem itself consists of 98 lines in elegiac couplets and written in Medieval Latin. The first ten verses justify the game as mental recreation, in which there is no malice (), no perjurious fraud, and no physical risk (), underlining also the advantage of playing without dice. Thus, the poem begins by expressing praise for the game of chess as a unique game that did not require gambling or dice. According to some chess historians, this initial statement was made in order to oppose common religious disapproval of games of chance that involved gambling. 

In the next ten verses the alternative coloring of the squares on the board is mentioned for the first time, not yet in general use but used by some players () as a simple yet advantageous invention to better calculate the moves, besides giving players the ability to discover, more easily, mistakes or false moves. Between verses 21-44 the two sides, red and white (), are described, together with the pieces. The movement of the pieces as well as the main regulatory conditions of the game are near identical to &quot;shatranj&quot; (Perso-Arabic chess), except for the pawn-promotion rule. From the poetic descriptions of the pieces and their movements, it can be interpreted that the movements differ from modern chess and can be summarized as follows:

* (king): It can move to any adjacent square. Unlike other pieces, it can never be captured, but when it&#x27;s under attack and surrounded so that it can no longer move, the game comes to an end.
* (queen): It can move only to a diagonal adjacent square, making it the second weakest piece.
* or (meaning &quot;count&quot; or &quot;aged one&quot;, today’s bishop): It can move diagonally to the third square of its original color.
* (knight): It can move to the third square of a different color, two steps straight ahead, then one step on the diagonal.
* or (&quot;rook&quot; or &quot;marquis&quot;, respectively): It can move in a straight direction as far as the player wishes.
* or (&quot;soldier&quot;, today&#x27;s pawn): It can only move to the square in front of it and captures another piece diagonally on an adjacent square of the same color, making it the weakest piece. If it reaches the eighth row then it&#x27;s allowed to move like the queen but only if the original queen is out of the board.

According to chess historian H. J. R. Murray: 

The most striking feature of this rather tedious poem is its freedom from Arabic terminology. The words &quot;check&quot; and &quot;mate&quot; are not used, and it is only the name of the game, &quot;scachi&quot;, in the title, and the word &quot;rochus&quot; that show that the writer is dealing with a game that is not of European invention. The nomenclature of the game is drawn from that of the state, and not from that of the army.

<doc id="486432" wikidata="Q187466" url="?curid=486432" title="Processor register">
<text>A processor register is a quickly accessible location available to a computer&#x27;s processor. Registers usually consist of a small amount of fast storage, although some registers have specific hardware functions, and may be read-only or write-only. In computer architecture, registers are typically addressed by mechanisms other than main memory, but may in some cases be assigned a memory address e.g. DEC PDP-10, ICT 1900.

Almost all computers, whether load/store architecture or not, load items of data from a larger memory into registers where they are used for arithmetic operations, bitwise operations, and other operations, and are manipulated or tested by machine instructions. Manipulated items are then often stored back to main memory, either by the same instruction or by a subsequent one. Modern processors use either static or dynamic random-access memory (RAM) as main memory, with the latter usually accessed via one or more cache levels.

Processor registers are normally at the top of the memory hierarchy, and provide the fastest way to access data. The term normally refers only to the group of registers that are directly encoded as part of an instruction, as defined by the instruction set. However, modern high-performance CPUs often have duplicates of these &quot;architectural registers&quot; in order to improve performance via register renaming, allowing parallel and speculative execution. Modern x86 design acquired these techniques around 1995 with the releases of Pentium Pro, Cyrix 6x86, Nx586, and AMD K5.

When a computer program accesses the same data repeatedly, this is called locality of reference. Holding frequently used values in registers can be critical to a program&#x27;s performance. Register allocation is performed either by a compiler in the code generation phase, or manually by an assembly language programmer.

== Size ==
Registers are normally measured by the number of bits they can hold, for example, an &quot;8-bit register&quot;, &quot;32-bit register&quot;, &quot;64-bit register&quot;, &quot;128-bit register&quot;, or more. In some instruction sets, the registers can operate in various modes, breaking down their storage memory into smaller parts (32-bit into four 8-bit ones, for instance) to which multiple data (vector, or one-dimensional array of data) can be loaded and operated upon at the same time. Typically it is implemented by adding extra registers that map their memory into a larger register. Processors that have the ability to execute single instructions on multiple data are called vector processors.

==Types==

A processor often contains several kinds of registers, which can be classified according to the types of values they can store or the instructions that operate on them:

* User-accessible registers can be read or written by machine instructions. The most common division of user-accessible registers is a division into data registers and address registers.
** Control registers are used to set the behaviour of system components such as the CPU.
** s can hold numeric data values such as integers and, in some architectures, floating-point numbers, as well as characters, small bit arrays and other data. In some older architectures, such as the IBM 704, the IBM 709 and successors, the PDP-1, the PDP-4/PDP-7/PDP-9/PDP-15, the PDP-5/PDP-8, and the HP 2100, a special data register known as the accumulator is used implicitly for many operations.
** s hold addresses and are used by instructions that indirectly access primary memory.
*** Some processors contain registers that may only be used to hold an &quot;address&quot; or only to hold &quot;numeric values&quot; (in some cases used as an index register whose value is added as an offset from some address); others allow registers to hold either kind of quantity. A wide variety of possible addressing modes, used to specify the effective address of an operand, exist.
*** The stack and frame pointers are used to manage the run-time stack. Rarely, other data stacks are addressed by dedicated address registers (see stack machine).
** General-purpose registers (&quot;&quot;s) can store both data and addresses, i.e., they are combined data/address registers; in some architectures, the register file is &quot;unified&quot; so that the GPRs can store floating-point numbers as well.
** Status registers hold truth values often used to determine whether some instruction should or should not be executed.
** s (&quot;FPR&quot;s) store floating-point numbers in many architectures.
** Constant registers hold read-only values such as zero, one, or pi.
** hold data for vector processing done by SIMD instructions (Single Instruction, Multiple Data).
** Special-purpose registers (&quot;SPR&quot;s) hold some elements of the program state; they usually include the program counter, also called the instruction pointer, and the status register; the program counter and status register might be combined in a program status word (PSW) register. The aforementioned stack pointer is sometimes also included in this group. Embedded microprocessors, such as microcontrollers, can also have special function registers corresponding to specialized hardware elements.
** Model-specific registers (also called &quot;machine-specific registers&quot;) store data and settings related to the processor itself. Because their meanings are attached to the design of a specific processor, they are not expected to remain standard between processor generations.
** Memory type range registers (&quot;MTRR&quot;s)
* s are not accessible by instructions and are used internally for processor operations.
** The instruction register holds the instruction currently being executed.
** Registers related to fetching information from RAM, a collection of storage registers located on separate chips from the CPU:
*** Memory buffer register (&quot;MBR&quot;), also known as &quot;memory data register&quot; (&quot;MDR&quot;)
*** Memory address register (&quot;MAR&quot;)
* Architectural registers are the registers visible to software and are defined by an architecture. They may not correspond to the physical hardware if register renaming is being performed by the underlying hardware.

Hardware registers are similar, but occur outside CPUs.

In some architectures (such as SPARC and MIPS), the first or last register in the integer register file is a &quot;pseudo-register&quot; in that it is hardwired to always return zero when read (mostly to simplify indexing modes), and it cannot be overwritten. In Alpha, this is also done for the floating-point register file. As a result of this, register files are commonly quoted as having one register more than how many of them are actually usable; for example, 32 registers are quoted when only 31 of them fit within the above definition of a register.

==Examples==
The following table shows the number of registers in several mainstream CPU architectures. Note that in x86-compatible processors, the stack pointer (codice_1) is counted as an integer register, even though there are a limited number of instructions that may be used to operate on its contents. Similar caveats apply to most architectures.

Although all of the below-listed architectures are different, almost all are in a basic arrangement known as the von Neumann architecture, first proposed by the Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann. It is also noteworthy that the number of registers on GPUs is much higher than that on CPUs.

==Usage==
The number of registers available on a processor and the operations that can be performed using those registers has a significant impact on the efficiency of code generated by optimizing compilers. The Strahler number of an expression tree gives the minimum number of registers required to evaluate that expression tree.

<doc id="486436" wikidata="Q3492913" url="?curid=486436" title="Rotational–vibrational spectroscopy">
<text>Rotational–vibrational spectroscopy is a branch of molecular spectroscopy that is concerned with infrared and Raman spectra of molecules in the gas phase. Transitions involving changes in both vibrational and rotational states can be abbreviated as rovibrational (or ro-vibrational) transitions. When such transitions emit or absorb photons (electromagnetic radiation), the frequency is proportional to the difference in energy levels and can be detected by certain kinds of spectroscopy. Since changes in rotational energy levels are typically much smaller than changes in vibrational energy levels, changes in rotational state are said to give fine structure to the vibrational spectrum. For a given vibrational transition, the same theoretical treatment as for pure rotational spectroscopy gives the rotational quantum numbers, energy levels, and selection rules. In linear and spherical top molecules, rotational lines are found as simple progressions at both higher and lower frequencies relative to the pure vibration frequency. In symmetric top molecules the transitions are classified as parallel when the dipole moment change is parallel to the principal axis of rotation, and perpendicular when the change is perpendicular to that axis. The ro-vibrational spectrum of the asymmetric rotor water is important because of the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere.

== Overview ==

Ro-vibrational spectroscopy concerns molecules in the gas phase. There are sequences of quantized rotational levels associated with both the ground and excited vibrational states. The spectra are often resolved into &quot;lines&quot; due to transitions from one rotational level in the ground vibrational state to one rotational level in the vibrationally excited state. The lines corresponding to a given vibrational transition form a &quot;band&quot;.

In the simplest cases the part of the infrared spectrum involving vibrational transitions with the same rotational quantum number (ΔJ = 0) in ground and excited states is called the Q-branch. On the high frequency side of the Q-branch the energy of rotational transitions is added to the energy of the vibrational transition. This is known as the R-branch of the spectrum for ΔJ = +1. The P-branch for ΔJ = −1 lies on the low wavenumber side of the Q branch. The appearance of the R-branch is very similar to the appearance of the pure rotation spectrum (but shifted to much higher wavenumbers), and the P-branch appears as a nearly mirror image of the R-branch. The Q branch is sometimes missing because of transitions with no change in J being forbidden.

The appearance of rotational fine structure is determined by the symmetry of the molecular rotors which are classified, in the same way as for pure rotational spectroscopy, into linear molecules, spherical-, symmetric- and asymmetric- rotor classes. The quantum mechanical treatment of rotational fine structure is the same as for pure rotation.

The strength of an absorption line is related to the number of molecules with the initial values of the vibrational quantum number ν and the rotational quantum number formula_1, and depends on temperature. Since there are actually formula_2 states with rotational quantum number formula_1, the population with value formula_1 increases with formula_1 initially, and then decays at higher formula_1. This gives the characteristic shape of the P and R branches.

A general convention is to label quantities that refer to the vibrational ground and excited states of a transition with double prime and single prime, respectively. For example, the rotational constant for the ground state is written as formula_7 and that of the excited state as formula_8
Also, these constants are expressed in the molecular spectroscopist&#x27;s units of cm−1. so that formula_9 in this article corresponds to formula_10 in the definition of rotational constant at Rigid rotor.

=== Method of combination differences ===
Numerical analysis of ro-vibrational spectral data would appear to be complicated by the fact that the wavenumber for each transition depends on two rotational constants, formula_11 and formula_12. However combinations which depend on only one rotational constant are found by subtracting wavenumbers of pairs of lines (one in the P-branch and one in the R-branch) which have either the same lower level or the same upper level. For example, in a diatomic molecule the line denoted &quot;P&quot;(&quot;J&quot; + 1) is due to the transition (&quot;v&quot; = 0, &quot;J&quot; + 1) → (&quot;v&quot; = 1, &quot;J&quot;) (meaning a transition from the state with vibrational quantum number ν going from 0 to 1 and the rotational quantum number going from some value &quot;J&quot; + 1 to &quot;J&quot;, with &quot;J&quot; &gt; 0), and the line &quot;R&quot;(&quot;J&quot; − 1) is due to the transition (&quot;v&quot; = 0, &quot;J&quot; − 1) → (&quot;v&quot; = 1, &quot;J&quot;). The difference between the two wavenumbers corresponds to the energy difference between the (&quot;J&quot; + 1) and (&quot;J&quot; − 1) levels of the lower vibrational state and is denoted by formula_13 since it is the difference between levels differing by two units of J. If centrifugal distortion is included, it is given by

:formula_14

where formula_15 means the frequency (or wavenumber) of the given line. The main term, formula_16 comes from the difference in the energy of the formula_17 rotational state, formula_18 and that of the formula_19 state, formula_20

The rotational constant of the ground vibrational state &quot;B&quot;′′ and centrifugal distortion constant, &quot;D&quot;′′ can be found by least-squares fitting this difference as a function of &quot;J&quot;. The constant &quot;B&quot;′′ is used to determine the internuclear distance in the ground state as in pure rotational spectroscopy. (See Appendix)

Similarly the difference &quot;R&quot;(&quot;J&quot;) − &quot;P&quot;(&quot;J&quot;) depends only on the constants &quot;B&quot;′ and &quot;D&quot;′ for the excited vibrational state (&quot;v&quot; = 1), and &quot;B&quot;′ can be used to determine the internuclear distance in that state (which is inaccessible to pure rotational spectroscopy).

:formula_21

== Linear molecules ==

=== Heteronuclear diatomic molecules===
Diatomic molecules with the general formula AB have one normal mode of vibration involving stretching of the A-B bond. The vibrational term values formula_22, for an anharmonic oscillator are given, to a first approximation, by
:formula_23
where &quot;v&quot; is a vibrational quantum number, ωe is the harmonic wavenumber and χe is an anharmonicity constant.

When the molecule is in the gas phase, it can rotate about an axis, perpendicular to the molecular axis, passing through the centre of mass of the molecule. The rotational energy is also quantized, with term values to a first approximation given by
:formula_24
where &quot;J&quot; is a rotational quantum number and &quot;D&quot; is a centrifugal distortion constant. The rotational constant, &quot;B&quot;v depends on the moment of inertia of the molecule, &quot;I&quot;v, which varies with the vibrational quantum number, &quot;v&quot;
:formula_25
where &quot;m&quot;A and &quot;m&quot;B are the masses of the atoms A and B, and &quot;d&quot; represents the distance between the atoms. The term values of the ro-vibrational states are found (in the Born–Oppenheimer approximation) by combining the expressions for vibration and rotation.
:formula_26
The first two terms in this expression correspond to a harmonic oscillator and a rigid rotor, the second pair of terms make a correction for anharmonicity and centrifugal distortion. A more general expression was given by Dunham.

The selection rule for electric dipole allowed ro-vibrational transitions, in the case of a diamagnetic diatomic molecule is
:formula_27formula_28
The transition with Δv=±1 is known as the fundamental transition. The selection rule has two consequences.
# Both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers must change. The transition :formula_29 (Q-branch) is forbidden
# The energy change of rotation can be either subtracted from or added to the energy change of vibration, giving the P- and R- branches of the spectrum, respectively.
The calculation of the transition wavenumbers is more complicated than for pure rotation because the rotational constant &quot;B&quot;ν is different in the ground and excited vibrational states. A simplified expression for the wavenumbers is obtained when the centrifugal distortion constants formula_30 and formula_31 are approximately equal to each other.

:formula_32

where positive &quot;m&quot; values refer to the R-branch and negative values refer to the P-branch. The term ω0 gives the position of the (missing) Q-branch, the term formula_33 implies an progression of equally spaced lines in the P- and R- branches, but the third term, formula_34shows that the separation between adjacent lines changes with changing rotational quantum number. When formula_11 is greater than formula_12, as is usually the case, as &quot;J&quot; increases the separation between lines decreases in the R-branch and increases in the P-branch. Analysis of data from the infrared spectrum of carbon monoxide, gives value of formula_11 of 1.915 cm−1 and formula_38 of 1.898 cm−1. The bond lengths are easily obtained from these constants as &quot;r&quot;0 = 113.3 pm, &quot;r&quot;1 = 113.6 pm. These bond lengths are slightly different from the equilibrium bond length. This is because there is zero-point energy in the vibrational ground state, whereas the equilibrium bond length is at the minimum in the potential energy curve. The relation between the rotational constants is given by
:formula_39
where ν is a vibrational quantum number and α is a vibration-rotation interaction constant which can be calculated when the B values for two different vibrational states can be found. For carbon monoxide &quot;req = 113.0 pm.

Nitric oxide, NO, is a special case as the molecule is paramagnetic, with one unpaired electron. Coupling of the electron spin angular momentum with the molecular vibration causes &quot;lambda-doubling&quot; with calculated harmonic frequencies of 1904.03 and 1903.68 cm−1. Rotational levels are also split.

===Homonuclear diatomic molecules===
The quantum mechanics for homonuclear diatomic molecules such as dinitrogen, N2, and fluorine, F2, is qualitatively the same as for heteronuclear diatomic molecules, but the selection rules governing transitions are different. Since the electric dipole moment of the homonuclear diatomics is zero, the fundamental vibrational transition is electric-dipole-forbidden and the molecules are infrared inactive. However, a weak quadrupole-allowed spectrum of N2 can be observed when using long path-lengths both in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. The spectra of these molecules can be observed by Raman spectroscopy because the molecular vibration is Raman-allowed.

Dioxygen is a special case as the molecule is paramagnetic so magnetic-dipole-allowed transitions can be observed in the infrared. The unit electron spin has three spatial orientations with respect to the molecular rotational angular momentum vector, N, so that each rotational level is split into three states with total angular momentum (molecular rotation plus electron spin) formula_40, J = N + 1, N, and N - 1, each J state of this so-called p-type triplet arising from a different orientation of the spin with respect to the rotational motion of the molecule. Selection rules for magnetic dipole transitions allow transitions between successive members of the triplet (ΔJ = ±1) so that for each value of the rotational angular momentum quantum number N there are two allowed transitions. The 16O nucleus has zero nuclear spins angular momentum, so that symmetry considerations demand that N may only have odd values.

=== Raman spectra of diatomic molecules ===
The selection rule is
:formula_41
so that the spectrum has an O-branch (∆&quot;J&quot; = −2), a Q-branch (∆&quot;J&quot; = 0) and an S-branch (∆&quot;J&quot;=+2). In the approximation that &quot;B&quot;′′ = &quot;B&quot;′ = &quot;B&quot; the wavenumbers are given by
:formula_42
:formula_43
since the S-branch starts at J=0 and the O-branch at J=2. So, to a first approximation, the separation between &quot;S&quot;(0) and &quot;O&quot;(2) is 12&quot;B&quot; and the separation between adjacent lines in both O- and S- branches is 4&quot;B&quot;. The most obvious effect of the fact that &quot;B&quot;′′ ≠ &quot;B&quot;′ is that the Q-branch has a series of closely spaced side lines on the low-frequency side due to transitions in which Δ&quot;J&quot;=0 for &quot;J&quot;=1,2 etc. Useful difference formulae, neglecting centrifugal distortion are as follows.
:formula_44
:formula_45
Molecular oxygen is a special case as the molecule is paramagnetic, with two unpaired electrons.

For homonuclear diatomics, nuclear spin statistical weights lead to alternating line intensities between even-formula_46 and odd-formula_46 levels. For nuclear spin &quot;I&quot; = 1/2 as in 1H2 and 19F2 the intensity alternation is 1:3. For 2H2 and 14N2, &quot;I&quot;=1 and the statistical weights are 6 and 3 so that the even-formula_46 levels are twice as intense. For 16O2 (&quot;I&quot;=0) all transitions with even values of formula_46 are forbidden.

=== Polyatomic linear molecules ===

These molecules fall into two classes, according to symmetry: centrosymmetric molecules with point group D∞h, such as carbon dioxide, CO2, and ethyne or acetylene, HCCH; and non-centrosymmetric molecules with point group C∞v such as hydrogen cyanide, HCN, and nitrous oxide, NNO. Centrosymmetric linear molecules have a dipole moment of zero, so do not show a pure rotation spectrum in the infrared or microwave regions. On the other hand, in certain vibrational excited states the molecules do have a dipole moment so that a ro-vibrational spectrum can be observed in the infrared.

The spectra of these molecules are classified according to the direction of the dipole moment change vector. When the vibration induces a dipole moment change pointing along the molecular axis the term &quot;parallel&quot; is applied, with the symbol formula_50. When the vibration induces a dipole moment pointing perpendicular to the molecular axis the term &quot;perpendicular&quot; is applied, with the symbol formula_51. In both cases the P- and R- branch wavenumbers follow the same trend as in diatomic molecules. The two classes differ in the selection rules that apply to ro-vibrational transitions. For parallel transitions the selection rule is the same as for diatomic molecules, namely, the transition corresponding to the Q-branch is forbidden. An example is the C-H stretching mode of hydrogen cyanide.

For a perpendicular vibration the transition Δ&quot;J&quot;=0 is allowed. This means that the transition is allowed for the molecule with the same rotational quantum number in the ground and excited vibrational state, for all the populated rotational states. This makes for an intense, relatively broad, Q-branch consisting of overlapping lines due to each rotational state. The N-N-O bending mode of nitrous oxide, at ca. 590 cm−1 is an example.

The spectra of centrosymmetric molecules exhibit alternating line intensities due to quantum state symmetry effects, since rotation of the molecule by 180° about a 2-fold rotation axis is equivalent to exchanging identical nuclei. In carbon dioxide, the oxygen atoms of the predominant isotopic species 12C16O2 have spin zero and are bosons, so that the total wavefunction must be symmetric when the two 16O nuclei are exchanged. The nuclear spin factor is always symmetric for two spin-zero nuclei, so that the rotational factor must also be symmetric which is true only for even-J levels. The odd-J rotational levels cannot exist and the allowed vibrational bands consist of only absorption lines from even-J initial levels. The separation between adjacent lines in the P- and R- branches is close to 4B rather than 2B as alternate lines are missing. For acetylene the hydrogens of 1H12C12C1H have spin-1/2 and are fermions, so the total wavefunction is antisymmetric when two 1H nuclei are exchanged. As is true for ortho and para hydrogen the nuclear spin function of the two hydrogens has three symmetric ortho states and one antisymmetric para states. For the three ortho states, the rotational wave function must be antisymmetric corresponding to odd J, and for the one para state it is symmetric corresponding to even J. The population of the odd J levels are therefore three times higher than the even J levels, and alternate line intensities are in the ratio 3:1.

== Spherical top molecules ==

These molecules have equal moments of inertia about any axis, and belong to the point groups Td (tetrahedral AX4) and Oh (octahedral AX6). Molecules with these symmetries have a dipole moment of zero, so do not have a pure rotation spectrum in the infrared or microwave regions.

Tetrahedral molecules such as methane, CH4, have infrared-active stretching and bending vibrations, belonging to the T2 (sometimes written as F2) representation. These vibrations are triply degenerate and the rotational energy levels have three components separated by the Coriolis interaction. The rotational term values are given, to a first order approximation, by
:formula_52
:formula_53
:formula_54
where formula_55 is a constant for Coriolis coupling. The selection rule for a fundamental vibration is 
:formula_56
Thus, the spectrum is very much like the spectrum from a perpendicular vibration of a linear molecule, with a strong Q-branch composed of many transitions in which the rotational quantum number is the same in the vibrational ground and excited states, formula_57 The effect of Coriolis coupling is clearly visible in the C-H stretching vibration of methane, though detailed study has shown that the first-order formula for Coriolis coupling, given above, is not adequate for methane.

== Symmetric top molecules ==
These molecules have a unique principal rotation axis of order 3 or higher. There are two distinct moments of inertia and therefore two rotational constants. For rotation about any axis perpendicular to the unique axis, the moment of inertia is formula_58 and the rotational constant is formula_59, as for linear molecules. For rotation about the unique axis, however, the moment of inertia is formula_60 and the rotational constant is formula_61. Examples include ammonia, NH3 and methyl chloride, CH3Cl (both of molecular symmetry described by point group C3v), boron trifluoride, BF3 and phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5 (both of point group D3h), and benzene, C6H6 (point group D6h).

For symmetric rotors a quantum number &quot;J&quot; is associated with the total angular momentum of the molecule. For a given value of J, there is a 2&quot;J&quot;+1- fold degeneracy with the quantum number, &quot;M&quot; taking the values +&quot;J&quot; ...0 ... -&quot;J&quot;. The third quantum number, &quot;K&quot; is associated with rotation about the principal rotation axis of the molecule. As with linear molecules, transitions are classified as &quot;parallel&quot;, formula_50 or &quot;perpendicular&quot;,formula_51, in this case according to the direction of the dipole moment change with respect to the principal rotation axis. A third category involves certain overtones and combination bands which share the properties of both parallel and perpendicular transitions. The selection rules are
:formula_50 If &quot;K&quot; ≠ 0, then Δ&quot;J&quot; = 0, ±1 and Δ&quot;K&quot; = 0
::If &quot;K&quot; = 0, then Δ&quot;J&quot; = ±1 and Δ&quot;K&quot; = 0
:formula_51 Δ&quot;J&quot; = 0, ±1 and Δ&quot;K&quot; = ±1
The fact that the selection rules are different is the justification for the classification and it means that the spectra have a different appearance which can often be immediately recognized.
An expression for the calculated wavenumbers of the P- and R- branches may be given as

:formula_66
::formula_67
::formula_68
in which &quot;m&quot; = &quot;J&quot;+1 for the R-branch and -&quot;J&quot; for the P-branch. The three centrifugal distortion constants formula_69, and formula_70 are needed to fit the term values of each level. The wavenumbers of the sub-structure corresponding to each band are given by
:formula_71
formula_72 represents the Q-branch of the sub-structure, whose position is given by
:formula_73.
=== Parallel bands ===
The C-Cl stretching vibration of methyl chloride, CH3Cl, gives a parallel band since the dipole moment change is aligned with the 3-fold rotation axis. The line spectrum shows the sub-structure of this band rather clearly; in reality, very high resolution spectroscopy would be needed to resolve the fine structure fully. Allen and Cross show parts of the spectrum of CH3D and give a detailed description of the numerical analysis of the experimental data.

=== Perpendicular bands ===
The selection rule for perpendicular bands give rise to more transitions than with parallel bands. A band can be viewed as a series of sub-structures, each with P, Q and R branches. The Q-branches are separated by approximately 2(&quot;A&quot;′-&quot;B&quot;′). The asymmetric HCH bending vibration of methyl chloride is typical. It shows a series of intense Q-branches with weak rotational fine structure. Analysis of the spectra is made more complicated by the fact that the ground-state vibration is bound, by symmetry, to be a degenerate vibration, which means that Coriolis coupling also affects the spectrum.

=== Hybrid bands ===
Overtones of a degenerate fundamental vibration have components of more than one symmetry type. For example, the first overtone of a vibration belonging to the E representation in a molecule like ammonia, NH3, will have components belonging to &quot;A&quot;1 and &quot;E&quot; representations. A transition to the &quot;A&quot;1 component will give a parallel band and a transition to the &quot;E&quot; component will give perpendicular bands; the result is a hybrid band.

=== Inversion in ammonia ===
For ammonia, NH3, the symmetric bending vibration is observed as two branches near 930 cm−1 and 965 cm−1. This so-called inversion doubling arises because the symmetric bending vibration is actually a large-amplitude motion known as inversion, in which the nitrogen atom passes through the plane of the three hydrogen atoms, similar to the inversion of an umbrella. The potential energy curve for such a vibration has a double minimum for the two pyramidal geometries, so that the vibrational energy levels occur in pairs which correspond to combinations of the vibrational states in the two potential minima. The two v = 1 states combine to form a symmetric state (1+) at 932.5 cm−1 above the ground (0+) state and an antisymmetric state (1−) at 968.3 cm−1.

The vibrational ground state (v = 0) is also doubled although the energy difference is much smaller, and the transition between the two levels can be measured directly in the microwave region, at ca. 24 GHz (0.8 cm−1). This transition is historically significant and was used in the ammonia maser, the fore-runner of the laser.

==Asymmetric top molecules==
Asymmetric top molecules have at most one or more 2-fold rotation axes. There are three unequal moments of inertia about three mutually perpendicular principal axes. The spectra are very complex. The transition wavenumbers cannot be expressed in terms of an analytical formula but can be calculated using numerical methods.

The water molecule is an important example of this class of molecule, particularly because of the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere. The low-resolution spectrum shown in green illustrates the complexity of the spectrum. At wavelengths greater than 10 μm (or wavenumbers less than 1000 cm−1) the absorption is due to pure rotation. The band around 6.3 μm (1590 cm−1) is due to the HOH bending vibration; the considerable breadth of this band is due to the presence of extensive rotational fine structure. High-resolution spectra of this band are shown in Allen and Cross, p 221. The symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations are close to each other, so the rotational fine structures of these bands overlap. The bands at shorter wavelength are overtones and combination bands, all of which show rotational fine structure. Medium resolution spectra of the bands around 1600 cm−1 and 3700 cm−1 are shown in Banwell and McCash, p91.

Ro-vibrational bands of asymmetric top molecules are classed as A-, B- or C- type for transitions in which the dipole moment change is along the axis of smallest moment of inertia to the highest.

==Experimental methods==
Ro-vibrational spectra are usually measured at high spectral resolution. In the past, this was achieved by using an echelle grating as the spectral dispersion element in a grating spectrometer. This is a type of diffraction grating optimized to use higher diffraction orders. Today at all resolutions the preferred method is FTIR. The primary reason for this is that infrared detectors are inherently noisy, and FTIR detects summed signals at multiple wavelengths simultaneously achieving a higher signal to noise by virtue of Fellgett&#x27;s advantage for multiplexed methods. The resolving power of an FTIR spectrometer depends on the maximum retardation of the moving mirror. For example, to achieve a resolution of 0.1 cm−1, the moving mirror must have a maximum displacement of 10 cm from its position at zero path difference. Connes measured the vibration-rotation spectrum of Venusian CO2 at this resolution. A spectrometer with 0.001 cm−1 resolution is now available commercially. The throughput advantage of FTIR is important for high-resolution spectroscopy as the monochromator in a dispersive instrument with the same resolution would have very narrow entrance and exit slits.

When measuring the spectra of gases it is relatively easy to obtain very long path-lengths by using a multiple reflection cell. This is important because it allows the pressure to be reduced so as to minimize pressure broadening of the spectral lines, which may degrade resolution. Path lengths up to 20m are commercially available.

== Appendix ==
The method of combination differences uses differences of wavenumbers in the P- and R- branches to obtain data that depend only on rotational constants in the vibrational ground or excited state. For the excited state
:formula_74
This function can be fitted, using the method of least-squares to data for carbon monoxide, from Harris and Bertolucci. The data calculated with the formula
:formula_75
in which centrifugal distortion is ignored, are shown in the columns labelled with (1). This formula implies that the data should lie on a straight line with slope 2B′′ and intercept zero. At first sight the data appear to conform to this model, with a root mean square residual of 0.21 cm−1. However, when centrifugal distortion is included, using the formula
:formula_76
the least-squares fit is improved markedly, with ms residual decreasing to 0.000086 cm−1. The calculated data are shown in the columns labelled with (2).

<text>The table below lists many of the tunnels under the River Thames in and near London, which, thanks largely to its underlying bed of clay, is one of the most tunnelled cities in the world. The tunnels are used for road vehicles, pedestrians, Underground and railway lines and utilities. Several tunnels are over a century old: the original Thames Tunnel was the world&#x27;s first underwater tunnel.

==List of tunnels==
== Other tunnels ==

The figure and list above leaves out a tunnel to the site of the old Ferranti power station on the east side of the mouth of Deptford Creek.

There is also a tunnel between Cottons centre and the old Billingsgate Fish Market near to London Bridge. Citibank used it for cabling at one point; it was large enough for a person to walk through. 

The Silvertown Tunnel will open on 7 April 2025.

The Thames Tideway Tunnel, due for completion in 2025, will be a long tunnel running mostly under the tidal section of the River Thames through central London to capture, store and convey almost all the raw sewage and rainwater that currently overflows into the river.

== Background ==

London&#x27;s abundance of river tunnels has resulted from a number of factors. For historical reasons, the city centre has relatively few railway bridges. Only three railway bridges exist in central London, only one of which provides through services across the capital. Consequently, railway builders have had to tunnel under the river in the city centre rather than bridge it. By contrast, railway bridges are relatively common to the west of the inner city.

Another historical factor has been the presence of the Port of London, which until the 1980s required large ships to be able to access the river as far upstream as the City of London. Until the construction of the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge at Dartford in 1991, the easternmost bridge on the Thames was Tower Bridge in central London. Even now, the Dartford Crossing provides the only way to cross the Thames by road between London and the sea. The width of the river downstream meant that tunnels were the only options for crossings before improvements in technology allowed the construction of high bridges such as the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge.

<text>A razor is a bladed tool primarily used in the removal of body hair through the act of shaving. Kinds of razors include straight razors, safety razors, disposable razors, and electric razors.

While the razor has been in existence since before the Bronze Age (the oldest razor-like object has been dated to 18,000 BC), the most common types of razors currently used are the safety razor and the electric razor.

== History ==
Razors have been identified from many Bronze Age cultures. These were made of bronze or obsidian and were generally oval-shaped, with a small tang protruding from one of the short ends.

Various forms of razors were used throughout history, which were different in appearance but similar in use to modern straight razors. In prehistoric times clam shells, shark teeth, and flint were sharpened and used to shave with. Drawings of such blades were found in prehistoric caves. Some tribes still use blades made of flint to this day. Excavations in Egypt have unearthed solid gold and copper razors in tombs dating back to the 4th millennium BC. Razors were used and manufactured in Kerma during the Bronze Age. Several razors as well as other personal hygiene artifacts were recovered from Bronze Age burials in northern Europe and are believed to belong to high-status individuals. The Roman historian Livy reported that the razor was introduced in ancient Rome in the 6th century BC by the legendary king Lucius Tarquinius Priscus.

The first modern straight razor, complete with decorated handles and hollow ground blades, was constructed in Sheffield, in England; in the 18th and 19th centuries, England was considered to be the center of the cutlery industry. Benjamin Huntsman produced the first superior hard steel grade, through a special crucible process, suitable for use as blade material in 1740, though it was first rejected in England. Huntsman&#x27;s process was adopted by the French sometime later; albeit reluctantly at first because of nationalist sentiments. English manufacturers were even more reluctant than the French to adopt the process and only did so after they saw its success in France. Sheffield steel (also called Sheffield silver steel) is a highly polished steel, famous for its deep gloss finish. It is considered to be of superior quality and is still used to this day in France by such manufacturers as Thiers Issard.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the wealthy had servants to shave them or could visit barbershops. Daily shaving was not a widespread practice in the 19th century; some never shaved at all. The custom of everyday shaving among American men only began after World War I. Men were required to shave daily so their gas masks would fit properly. This became much easier with the introduction of the safety razor, which was standard issue during the war.


Straight razors were the most common form of shaving before the 20th century and remained common in many countries until the 1950s. Barbers were specially trained to give customers a thorough and quick shave, and a collection of straight razors ready for use was a common sight in most barbershops. Modern-day barbers still keep straight razors, but they use them less often.

Straight razors eventually fell out of fashion. Their first challenger was manufactured by King C. Gillette: a double-edged safety razor with replaceable blades. Gillette&#x27;s idea was the use of the &quot;loss leader&quot; concept, in which the razors were sold at a loss, but the replacement blades earned a high margin and provided continuous sales. They were immensely successful because of advertising campaigns and slogans denigrating the straight razor&#x27;s effectiveness and questioning its safety.

These new safety razors did not require any serious tutelage to use. The blades were extremely hard to sharpen, were meant to be thrown away after one use, and rusted quickly if not discarded. They also required a smaller initial investment, though they cost more over time. Despite its long-term advantages, the straight razor lost significant market share. As shaving became less intimidating and men began to shave themselves more, the demand for barbers providing straight razor shaves decreased.

In 1960, stainless steel blades which could be used more than once became available, reducing the cost of safety-razor shaving. The first such blades were made by the Wilkinson firm, famous maker of ceremonial swords, in Sheffield. Soon Gillette, Schick, and other manufacturers were making stainless steel blades.

These were followed by multiple-blade cartridges and disposable razors. For each type of replaceable blade, there is generally a disposable razor.

In the 1930s, electric razors became available. These can rival the cost of a good straight razor, although the whole straight-razor shaving kit can exceed the cost of even an expensive electric razor.

== Straight razors ==
Straight razors with open steel blades, also commonly known as cut-throats, were the most commonly used razors before the 20th century.

Straight razors consist of a blade sharpened on one edge. The blade can be made of either stainless steel, which is slower to hone and strop, but it is easier to maintain since it does not stain easily, or high carbon steel, which hones and strops quickly and keeps its edge well, but rusts and stains easily if not cleaned and dried promptly. At present, stainless-steel razors are harder to find than carbon steel, but both remain in production.

The blade rotates on a pin through its tang between two protective pieces called scales: when folded into the scales, the blade is protected from damage, and the user is protected. Handle scales are made of various materials, including mother-of-pearl, celluloid, bone, plastic, and wood. Once made of ivory, this has been discontinued, although fossil ivory is used occasionally.

===Disposable blade straight razors (known as shavettes) ===

These razors are similar in use and appearance to straight razors, but use disposable blades, either standard double-edged cut in half or specially made single edge. These shavettes are used in the same way as straight razors but do not require stropping and honing.

== Safety razors ==
The first step towards a safer-to-use razor was the guard razor – also called a straight safety razor – which added a protective guard to a regular straight razor. The first such razor was most likely invented by a French cutler Jean-Jacques Perret circa 1762. The invention was inspired by the joiner&#x27;s plane and was essentially a straight razor with its blade surrounded by a wooden sleeve. The earliest razor guards had comb-like teeth and could only be attached to one side of a razor; a reversible guard was one of the first improvements made to guard razors.

An early description of a safety razor similar in form to the ones used today is found on William Samuel Henson&#x27;s 1847 patent application for a comb tooth guard. This guard could be attached to a straight razor or to a razor &quot;the cutting blade which is at right angles with the handle, and resembles somewhat the form of a common hoe.&quot;

Around 1875 a new design with a smaller blade placed on top of a handle was marketed by the Kampfe Brothers as &quot;the best available shaving method on the market that won’t cut a user, like straight steel razors.&quot;

=== Removable-blade razors ===

The term safety razor was first used in 1880 and described a basic razor with a handle attached to a head where a removable blade may be placed. The edge was then protected by a comb patterned on the head to protect the skin. In the more modern-day produced safety razors, the comb is now more commonly replaced by a safety bar. There are two types of safety razors, single-edged and double-edged. The single-edged razor is essentially a long segment of a straight razor. The double-edged safety razor is a razor with a slant bar that can be used on both sides, with two open edges. The blade on the double-edged safety razor is slightly curved to allow for a smoother and cleaner shave.

In 1901, the American inventor King Camp Gillette, with the assistance of William Nickerson, submitted a patent for a new variation of safety razor with disposable blades which was patented in 1904. One reason was that shaving with a safety razor should be safer and more convenient than shaving with a classic straight razor with a sharp blade. The thick grip of these safety razors can be reused. Gillette realized that a profit could be made by selling an inexpensive razor with disposable blades. This has been called the razor and blades business model, and has become a very common practice for a wide variety of products.

Many other brands of safety razors have come and gone. Much of the competition was based on designing blades that would fit only one style of razor until the blade shape was standardized by the inclusion of a multi-faceted central channel to the blade which would accommodate the various designs of blade securing systems; e.g., three pins, a slender metal bar, etc. Even today, these various securing forms still persist in their variety in DE razors, all accepting the same universal blade design.

=== Cartridge razors ===

Exploiting the same razor and blades business model as pioneered in the early 20th century, cartridge razors were developed in the 1960s and are now the most common form of shaving in developed countries. Although designed to have a more ergonomic shape at both the handle and head (including commonly a pivoted head which keeps the blades angled to the skin at a predetermined angle through the shaving motion), the concept is very similar to that of the double edge razor. However, here, the entire head assembly (a cartridge) is removed and disposed of, not just the blade. It is also common for these cartridge heads to have multiple razor blades set into them, commonly between two and five blades.

In 2023, US-based retailers sold 20 percent fewer razor blades than in 2019.

=== Disposable safety razors ===

Disposable safety razors are highly similar in design to cartridge razors, constructed from inexpensive materials (most commonly injection molded polycarbonate), yet are meant to be wholly disposable after use with no blade sharpening or replacement possible. One device was invented in 1963 by American entertainer and inventor Paul Winchell.

===Lifespan===
Safety razor life may be extended by drying the blades after use.

== Electric razors ==
The electric razor (also known as an electric dry shaver) has a rotating or oscillating blade. Its use typically does not require the use of shaving cream, soap, or water. The razor may be powered by a small DC motor, which is either powered by batteries or mains electricity. Many modern-day models are powered using rechargeable batteries. Alternatively, some models use an electro-mechanical oscillator driven by an AC-energized solenoid. Some early mechanical shavers had no electric motor and had to be powered by hand.

The first electric razor was invented by John F. O’Rourke in 1898. Industrial production of electric razor machines started in 1937 by the US company Remington Rand based on the patent of Jacob Schick from 1928. Since 1939 the Dutch company Philips has produced electric razor machines. One of the main differences between electric razors is the shaving technology they use. Usually, electric shaving machines use several round rotating shaving blades or a horizontally shaver’s foil and cutter block technology.

== Other razors ==

Thick, rigid, single-edged razors such as utility knives are used for various hand-held tasks. Applications include detailed carpentry work like sanding and scraping (in a specialized holder), paper cutting for technical drawing, plumbing, and finish work such as grouting and cleaning, and removing paint from flat surfaces such as panes of glass. Unlike shaving razors, the industrial-grade blades used in these tools are usually made from non-stainless steel like carbon steel, and have a tougher and duller edge.

A lame is a razor used in bread production to slash the surface of an unbaked loaf.

<doc id="486445" wikidata="Q3302518" url="?curid=486445" title="Intercostal muscles">
<text>The intercostal muscles comprise many different groups of muscles that run between the ribs, and help form and move the chest wall. The intercostal muscles are mainly involved in the mechanical aspect of breathing by helping expand and shrink the size of the chest cavity.

==Structure==
There are three principal layers:
# External intercostal muscles also known as intercostalis externus aid in quiet and forced inhalation. They originate on ribs 1–11 and have their insertion on ribs 2–12. The external intercostals are responsible for the elevation of the ribs and bending them more open, thus expanding the transverse dimensions of the thoracic cavity. The muscle fibers are directed downwards, forwards and medially in the anterior part.
# Internal intercostal muscles also known as intercostalis internus aid in forced expiration (quiet expiration is a passive process). They originate on ribs 2–12 and have their insertions on ribs 1–11.Their fibers pass anterior and superior from the upper margin of the rib and costal cartilage to the lower margin of the rib above. The internal intercostals are responsible for the depression of the ribs and bending them inward, thus decreasing the transverse dimensions of the thoracic cavity. The muscle fibers are directed downwards, forwards and laterally forming right angle with external intercostal muscle.
# Innermost intercostal muscle also known as intercostalis intimus are deep layers of the internal intercostal muscles which are separated from them by a neurovascular bundle. The muscle fibers are directed downwards, forwards and laterally same as intercostalis internus muscle.

===Nerve supply===
Both the external and internal muscles are innervated by the intercostal nerves(the ventral rami of thoracic spinal nerves), are supplied by the intercostal arteries, and are drained by the intercostal veins. Their fibers run in opposite directions.

==Function==
The scalene muscles, which also move the chest wall and have a function in inhalation, are also intercostal muscles, just not one of the three principal layers.

<doc id="486450" wikidata="Q5162896" url="?curid=486450" title="Consequentialist justifications of the state">
<text>Consequentialist justifications of the state are philosophical arguments which contend that the state is justified by the good results it produces.

The justification of the state is the source of legitimate authority for the state or government. Typically, a justification of the state explains why the state should exist, and what a legitimate state should or should not be able to do. Consequentialist justifications of the state focus on the results that are achieved when certain institutions are put in place. They are based on consequentialist theories such as utilitarianism. Consequentialism is sometimes confused with utilitarianism, but utilitarianism is only one member of a broad family of consequentialist theories.

Consequentialist theories usually maintain that the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on whether the results of the action are desirable. They are frequently contrasted to deontological theories of morality, which typically hold that certain actions are either forbidden or wrong &quot;&quot;.

== Justifications of state ==

In law and political theory, a state or sovereign is an institution that legitimates a particular government. Sometimes arguments about legitimacy have a mystical side to them, as when kings claim divine right.

Different political philosophies have distinct opinions concerning the state as a domestic organization monopolizing force.

As an example, consequentialists might observe that the state builds bridges. They would ask whether those bridges would have been built in the absence of the state and whether those bridges are valued by those who use them. If the bridges would not have otherwise been built and they are valuable to those who use them, then the existence of the state is justified.

A philosopher who doubts or denies the legitimacy of the state might respond by questioning the ethical premise, saying for example that the workers who built that bridge were exploited by the government that ordered it built, and/or by the investors in the private contractors who profited. The philosopher might have a deontological theory of exploitation.

Alternatively, a skeptic might concede that the bridge is a good consequence but contend that even on consequentialist grounds the argument fails. He might argue that an even better bridge might have been built under anarchist conditions. This counter-argument raises the issue of opportunity cost and the whole issue becomes an exercise in economic reasoning.

<doc id="486455" wikidata="Q3520039" url="?curid=486455" title="Blue Cross (animal charity)">
<text>Blue Cross is a registered animal welfare charity in the United Kingdom, founded in 1897. The charity provides veterinary care, offers expert behavioural help, and finds homes for pets in need. Their pet bereavement service supports those who are struggling to cope with the loss of a much-loved pet.

The charity works closely with a number of other organisations to help animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.

==History==

The organisation was founded on 10 May 1897 in London as &quot;Our Dumb Friends&#x27; League&quot; (ODFL), to care for working horses on the streets of the British capital. It opened its first animal hospital, in Victoria, London, on 15 May 1906.

In 1912, the league launched The Blue Cross Fund to care for horses during the Balkan War. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, it was quickly reopened again. By the armistice in 1918, the Blue Cross Fund had raised nearly £170,000 – the equivalent of almost £6.5 million today – to care for the animals of conflict. Over 50,000 horses were treated in Blue Cross hospitals in France, and the charity had sent vital veterinary supplies to 3,500 units of the British Army. The president of the Blue Cross Fund was Olive Smith-Dorrien.

In 1914, the President of ODFL was Lord Lonsdale and the chairman was Charles W. Forward. There were 86 members on the League&#x27;s Grand Council. 

Donations to the Blue Cross Fund enabled the charity to care for more than 350,000 animals during the Second World War, many of whom were wounded during the Blitz. The name of the appeal fund became more widely known than the official charity title and the league officially changed its name to &quot;The Blue Cross&quot; in 1950. In 2011 the charity dropped &quot;The&quot; from its name and is now simply known as &quot;Blue Cross.&quot;

Sally de la Bedoyere became the charity&#x27;s CEO in November 2014. In June 2020, Chris Burghes joined Blue Cross as CEO.

==Operations==
Blue Cross operates a number of services throughout the United Kingdom. Its major services are: rehoming unwanted animals, providing veterinary services to pet owners who cannot afford the private fees charged by private veterinary surgeons, promoting animal welfare through education, and operating the Pet Bereavement Support Service, a free and confidential support line for those who have lost a pet. They also operate a horse ambulance service, including at large equestrian events.

Blue Cross operates four animal hospitals, three of which are in London, at Victoria, Merton and Hammersmith, and a fourth in Grimsby, Lincolnshire. In 2014 it opened a pet care clinic in Derby, and has since opened a further four. Blue Cross carried out over 97,000 treatments, operations and diagnostic investigations in 2010.

Blue Cross is also heavily involved in animal adoption, arranging adoption for companion animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits and small rodents, as well as larger species such as horses. In 2015, the charity&#x27;s rehoming team helped 9,160 animals and its veterinary team helped 29,549 animals. The organisation also works to improve the lives of animals through promotion to pet owners and work in animal behaviour therapy. Every pet owner that rehomes a pet through the charity can benefit from free behaviour advice for the pet&#x27;s lifetime. The Pet Bereavement Support Service is a free and confidential telephone and email helpline and is available 365 days a year to help people who are struggling to cope with the loss of a pet.

On 26 January 2010, Blue Cross announced the proposed closure of the two animal adoption centres (Felixstowe and Northiam, East Sussex), both of which had been in existence for over 50 years. Final decisions on both sites were announced on 4 May 2010. After an extensive publicity campaign by locals, it was announced that plans to close the Felixstowe centre had been dropped. The Felixstowe centre was relocated to a brand new purpose-built site near Ipswich, Suffolk, in 2016 and can now care for double the number of pets as the previous site was able to care for. Blue Cross also opened a new animal adoption centre in Newport, South Wales, in 2016.

==Partnerships==
The Irish Blue Cross is a related party of Blue Cross.

The Blue Cross is an Advisory Member of the Animal Behaviour &amp; Training Council (ABTC).

==Awards==
Medals have been awarded by Blue Cross to animals and people who have demonstrated bravery or heroism. While the first medals were awarded to people who helped to rescue animals, medals were awarded in 1918 to honour a number of horses which had served in the First World War. Medals were then given out between 1940 and 1951 to a number of dogs, including Juliana who reportedly extinguished an incendiary bomb by urinating on it. In 2006 Jake, a police explosives dog, was given the honour after helping to clear out the London Underground after the 7 July 2005 London bombings. In 2017, Staffordshire bull terrier Romeo received the Blue Cross Medal for being a therapy dog for stroke victims and dementia sufferers and donating blood.

<text>eMachines was a brand of economical personal computers. In 2004, it was acquired by Gateway, Inc., which was in turn acquired by Acer Inc. in 2007. The EMachines brand was discontinued in 2013.

==History==

eMachines was founded in September 1998 by Lap Shun Hui as a joint venture of South Korean companies Korea Data Systems and TriGem. The companies first computers, the eTower 266 and 300, were sold at prices ranging at $399 or $499 respectively, not including a monitor.

By March 1999, the company was ranked fourth in U.S. computer sales, with a 9.9% market share.

In August 1999, the company released the eOne, a computer that resembled the iMac, priced at $799, with a $400 rebate for customers who signed a 3-year agreement with CompuServe.

In September 1999, the company announced plans to launch an internet service provider.

The business acquired Free-PC in November 1999, which had previously provided free computers in exchange for advertising.

On March 24, 2000, near the peak of the dot-com bubble, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, raising $180 million. By that time, the company had sold 2 million computers, but had lost $84.5 million in the previous year on $815 million in sales and a 4% profit margin. Shares fell 8% in their debut. At that time, major shareholders included AOL with a 6.4% stake and Bill T. Gross with a 12.4% stake.

By May 2001, the stock was trading at 38 cents per share and the company was delisted from the NASDAQ.

In January 2002, Lap Shun Hui acquired the company for $161 million.

In December 2003, the company released the T6000 desktop, the world&#x27;s first mass-marketed AMD Athlon 64-based system, retailing at US$1,299. The systems were primarily sold through Best Buy stores, but the PCs were also available online.

In January 2004, the company released the M6805 &amp; M6807 notebooks, the first notebook computers based on the AMD Mobile Athlon 64 processor. 

In March 2004, the company was acquired by Gateway Inc. for 50 million shares of Gateway common stock and $30 million cash. Wayne Inouye, CEO of eMachines, became CEO of Gateway, with founder Ted Waitt stepping down.

In October 2007, Acer Inc. acquired Gateway.

On January 17, 2013, the eMachines brand was discontinued.

<text>Non-access stratum (NAS) is a functional layer in the NR, LTE, UMTS and GSM wireless telecom protocol stacks between the core network and user equipment. 
This layer is used to manage the establishment of communication sessions and for maintaining continuous communications with the user equipment as it moves. The NAS is defined in contrast to the Access Stratum which is responsible for carrying information over the wireless portion of the network.
A further description of NAS is that it is a protocol for messages passed between the User Equipment, also known as mobiles, and Core Nodes (e.g. Mobile Switching Center, Serving GPRS Support Node, or Mobility Management Entity) that is passed transparently through the radio network. Examples of NAS messages include Update or Attach messages, Authentication Messages, Service Requests and so forth. Once the User Equipment (UE) establishes a radio connection, the UE uses the radio connection to communicate with the core nodes to coordinate service. The distinction is that the Access Stratum is for dialogue explicitly between the mobile equipment and the radio network and the NAS is for dialogue between the mobile equipment and core network nodes. 

For LTE, the Technical Specification for NAS is 3GPP TS 24.301. For NR, the Technical Specification for NAS is TS 24.501.

<text>&quot;De Âlde Friezen&quot; () is the anthem of the Friesland province of the Netherlands.

The text is by the Frisian writer Eeltsje Halbertsma. The version commonly sung today is an abridgement, dating from 1876, by Jacobus van Loon. The words were not set to music until after Halbertsma&#x27;s death; they were first sung in 1875 at a ceremony held to commemorate his work. 
The song was adopted as the Frisian anthem by the &quot;Selskip foar Frysk Taal- en Skriftekennisse&quot; (Society for Frisian Language and Literature) and has served as the anthem of Friesland ever since.

<doc id="486475" wikidata="Q5206423" url="?curid=486475" title="DWARF">
<text>DWARF is a widely used, standardized debugging data format. DWARF was originally designed along with Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), although it is independent of object file formats. The name is a medieval fantasy complement to &quot;ELF&quot; that had no official meaning, although the name &quot;Debugging With Arbitrary Record Formats&quot; has since been proposed as a backronym.

DWARF originated with the C compiler and sdb debugger in Unix System V Release 4 (SVR4).

== History ==

The first version of DWARF proved to use excessive amounts of storage, and an incompatible successor, DWARF-2, superseded it and added various encoding schemes to reduce data size. DWARF did not immediately gain universal acceptance; for instance, when Sun Microsystems adopted ELF as part of their move to Solaris, they opted to continue using stabs, in an embedding known as &quot;stabs-in-elf&quot;. Linux followed suit, and DWARF-2 did not become the default until the late 1990s.

The DWARF Workgroup of the Free Standards Group released DWARF version 3 in January 2006, adding (among other things) support for C++ namespaces, Fortran 90 data and additional compiler optimization techniques.

The DWARF committee published version 4 of DWARF, which offers &quot;improved data compression, better description of optimized code, and support for new language features in C++&quot;, in 2010.

Version 5 of the DWARF format was published in February 2017. It &quot;incorporates improvements in many areas: better data compression, separation of debugging data from executable files, improved description of macros and source files, faster searching for symbols, improved debugging of optimized code, as well as numerous improvements in functionality and performance.&quot;

== Structure ==

DWARF uses a data structure called a Debugging Information Entry (DIE) to represent each variable, type, procedure, etc. A DIE has a tag (e.g., , , ) and attributes (key-value pairs). A DIE can have nested (child) DIEs, forming a tree structure. A DIE attribute can refer to another DIE anywhere in the tree—for instance, a DIE representing a variable would have a entry pointing to the DIE describing the variable&#x27;s type.

To save space, two large tables needed by symbolic debuggers are represented as byte-coded instructions for simple, special-purpose finite-state machines. The Line Number Table, which maps code locations to source code locations and vice versa, also specifies which instructions are part of function prologues and epilogues. The Call Frame Information table allows debuggers to locate frames on the call stack.

DWARF has been divided into different sections such as .debug_info, .debug_frame, etc.

== Tools ==
Libdwarf is a library that provides access to the DWARF debugging information in executable files and object files.

== Further reading ==

Michael Eager, chair of the DWARF Standards Committee, has written an introduction to debugging formats and DWARF 3, &quot;Introduction to the DWARF Debugging Format&quot;.

<doc id="486476" wikidata="Q7356235" url="?curid=486476" title="Rod Hull">
<text>Rodney Stephen Hull (13 August 1935 – 17 March 1999) was a British comedian and popular entertainer on television in the 1970s and 1980s. He rarely appeared without Emu, a mute and highly aggressive arm-length puppet modelled on the Australian bird.

==Early life ==
Hull was born on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, England in 1935. He attended Delamark Road School and the County Technical School, Sheerness. After national service with the Royal Air Force, he qualified as an electrician.

==TV career==
===Australia ===
Hull moved to Australia in 1956. His first job in television was as a lighting technician with TCN Channel 9 in Sydney. He then began appearing on air, including as Constable Clot in Channel 9&#x27;s &quot;Kaper Kops&quot; with Reg Gorman and Desmond Tester, a regular segment in its children&#x27;s afternoon programming. Clot proved popular and soon gained his own segment, &quot;Clot in the Clouds&quot;, which depicted him daydreaming about having other professions, such as a world-famous brain surgeon, &#x27;Blood Clot.&#x27;

Later he worked with Marilyn Mayo as co-host of a children&#x27;s breakfast TV programme, &quot;The Super Flying Fun Show&quot;, playing a wacky character named &#x27;Caretaker Clot,&#x27; an extension of his &quot;Kaper Cops&quot; role. Hull first used Emu as a puppet in this show. There are conflicting reports as to how this came about. The 2003 Channel 4 documentary &quot;Rod Hull: A Bird in the Hand&quot; states that &quot;In fact, Emu was a Channel Nine creation&quot;. Other sources cite a Channel Nine producer, Jim Badger, who said that he had requested a reluctant Hull to use Emu. Hull claimed full authorship of Emu, saying, &quot;Sure I found him in a cupboard, but I had put him there in the first place. I concocted him, nobody else.&quot; The bird subsequently became a regular part of Hull&#x27;s set on cabarets back in the United Kingdom and Australia.

===Britain ===
Hull returned to the UK in 1971 and signed with International Artists. Soon after, his Australian success translated to his native country with Hull appearing on several children&#x27;s and adult light entertainment shows.

His first UK television appearance came on the ITV show &quot;Saturday Variety&quot;, but it was his appearance in the 1972 Royal Variety Performance that provided his springboard to national recognition.

==Emu==
Hull used Emu to create havoc while not accepting blame for it. The use of a false arm attached to Hull&#x27;s jacket, which cradled the emu, made it appear that the neck and head moved of its own volition. Hull used the puppet to make violent attacks on people nearby. During these events Hull would make half-hearted attempts to pull the bird away from its victim but would often become embroiled in the fracas, rolling around on the floor, creating theatrical mayhem.

When Hull left &quot;The Super Flying Fun Show&quot; and Australia, a duplicate of Emu was made so the character could continue on the show, much to Hull&#x27;s annoyance, and comedian Marty Morton took over Hull&#x27;s co-hosting position in Australia.

Hull and Emu were regulars on &quot;The Hudson Brothers Razzle Dazzle Show&quot;, which aired for one season as a Saturday morning children&#x27;s show on American broadcaster CBS in 1974-75.

At least two people have alleged that Hull sexually assaulted women using Emu as a cover. Darts champion Eric Bristow wrote: &quot;He used the puppet to feel up women and stick his hand between people&#x27;s legs.&quot; In a 2007 interview with &quot;Chortle&quot;, comedy producer Michael Hurll said to Hull &quot;Look Rod, you&#x27;ve got your hand in that emu, up girls&#x27; skirts and squeezing their tits; doing things you would get locked up for.&quot; Hurll reported similar assaults on men in a Channel 4 documentary, &quot;Rod Hull: A Bird in the Hand&quot; (2003).

In 1972, Hull destroyed The Queen Mother&#x27;s bouquet of flowers during the after-show line-up at the Royal Variety Performance. During 1976, Hull&#x27;s Emu repeatedly attacked Michael Parkinson during his chat show, eventually causing Parkinson to fall off his chair. Fellow guest Billy Connolly threatened, &quot;If that bird comes anywhere near me, I&#x27;ll break its neck and your bloody arm!&quot; In later years, Parkinson later referred to Emu as &quot;that bloody bird.&quot;

He later starred in the television series &quot;Emu&#x27;s Broadcasting Company&quot; (1975–1980), &quot;Emu&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;EMU TV&quot; and &quot;Emu&#x27;s All Live Pink Windmill Show&quot;, taking his television career up to 1991.

In 1983 he appeared in the US on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, attacking host Johnny Carson, even after he was asked not to by the producers, and Richard Pryor in one of his first public appearances after undergoing major emergency reconstructive surgery on his face.

==Later life==
By the 1990s, Hull was seen less frequently on TV, although he continued to appear in pantomime and television commercials, made personal appearances and occasional TV appearances. Comedians Richard Herring and Stewart Lee included a &quot;not Rod Hull&quot; character in their 1996 television sketch show &quot;Fist of Fun&quot;, played by the actor Kevin Eldon. This character was performed as a grotesque imitation of Hull and was finally unmasked by the real Rod Hull who appeared in the last episode of the series. It was to be Hull&#x27;s penultimate television appearance.

A 2003 Channel 4 documentary, &quot;Rod Hull: A Bird in the Hand&quot;, suggested that Hull nursed an increasing resentment towards his puppet, believing that the success of the bird prevented him from pursuing other avenues in show business. He saw himself, according to the makers of the programme, as a talented performer who could have developed a more varied career in the entertainment industry had he not been repeatedly forced to perform with the Emu. Hull once complained, &quot;I want to write but Emu doesn&#x27;t leave me the time. I want to be a comedian in my own right, but again Emu won&#x27;t let me do it.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hull married his first wife Sandra Carter in 1958; they had two daughters, Deborah and Danielle. Hull&#x27;s second wife, Cher Hylton-Hull, who he married in 1978, already had a daughter, Catrina, and the couple had three children together: Toby, Amelia, and Oliver. Catrina appeared in his &quot;Pink Windmill&quot; show.

He was a fan of the football club Bristol Rovers, and he recorded a song called &quot;Bristol Rovers All the Way&quot; in 1974, with the squad of that time.

In 1986 Hull bought Restoration House in Rochester for £270,000 but the cost of renovations and an unpaid tax bill, caused by his accountant not paying his tax properly over the previous 20 years and the recession and property slump, resulted in Hull leaving the property in October 1993 and then bankruptcy in September 1994. His production company, Hibou Productions went bust with debts of £38,500. Cher, who had been instrumental in his success, moved back to her home country of Australia with their children, while Hull remained in England and relocated to a shepherd&#x27;s cottage in East Sussex.

==Death==
On the night of 17 March 1999, Hull was trying to adjust the television aerial on the roof of his bungalow at half-time during an Inter Milan vs. Manchester United Champions League match, when he slipped and fell. He suffered a severe skull fracture and chest injuries, and was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital in Hastings. Following an inquest, the coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.

==Legacy==
Prior to Hull&#x27;s death, Lee and Herring had planned to revive their &quot;not Rod Hull&quot; character for their contemporary series, &quot;This Morning with Richard Not Judy&quot;, but although they filmed several sketches – in which the character would die after performing a pointless stunt – the footage was never used. Instead, the final episode of the second and final series of &quot;This Morning with Richard Not Judy&quot; concluded with a post-credits sketch featuring Kevin Eldon&#x27;s Rod Hull character, fading out to a simple dedication reading &quot;This series is dedicated to Rod Hull.&quot;

Hull and Emu were also the subject of the song &quot;No One Knew the Real Emu&quot; by The Toy Dolls (2004).

Upon Hull&#x27;s death, Michael Parkinson reminisced that he had found him to be &quot;a very charming, intelligent, and sensitive man – quite unlike the Emu.&quot; He observed that the puppet &quot;was the dark side of Rod&#x27;s personality, and very funny, provided it was not on top of you.&quot;

His son Toby brought Emu out of retirement for the first time since his father&#x27;s death during the 2003 pantomime season, appearing in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Windsor. Toby Hull and Emu later appeared in their own series on CITV.

In June 2018, puppeteer Phil Fletcher bought one of the last remaining Emu puppets for £8,860 at Chippenham Auction Rooms in Wiltshire.

<text>Weird TV, or Weird Television, was a programme that aired in 1991 on Canadian late-night TV, as well as American stations such as KCOP, Channel 13 in Los Angeles; KTZZ (now KZJO), Channel 22 in Seattle, and Columbus, Ga. NBC affiliate WLTZ, Channel 38.

==Premise==
The &quot;host&quot; of the show was Chuck Cirino, who was also one of the show&#x27;s executive producers along with Todd Stevens (who also produced the hit show &quot;Friends&quot;) and Arthur Maturo.

Cirino was the one constant of every show. He pops up in his landcruiser for a few seconds, setting up new segments of the show in his own eccentric way. He is known as the &quot;comfort zone&quot; of the show, as the subtitles during these segments tell you.

Also included in the program were clips Cirino had filmed from the Burning Man festival.

Segments include:
*Weird America, a segment of the show in which the crew flies out to unusual events all across the country. For example, &quot;Car Hunt&quot;, where a full-sized, remote-controlled car is let loose in the Nevada desert and is hunted down with high-powered weapons, &quot;just like big game&quot;, according to Cirino.
*Shadoevision, a continuing science-fiction thriller hosted by Shadoe Stevens.
*The Dr. Ruehl show, where noted &quot;phenomenologist&quot; Dr. Franklin Ruehl talks about viewers of the latest cases of strange phenomena.
*Video Dave&#x27;s &quot;UFO Clip of the Week&quot;, where Dave Aaron reports on the latest extraterrestrial sightings from around the world.
*Newsweird, which features strange news from around the globe.
*Weird music videos, such as those for Monster Magnet&#x27;s &quot;Negasonic Teenage Warhead&quot; and Skunk Anansie&#x27;s &quot;Selling Jesus&quot;.

Another segment of the show includes stand-alone video pieces that are produced specifically for the show, as well as other video pieces sent in by viewers themselves.

These include:
* Zatar the Mutant King, played by David Floyd. Zatar wears a dark cloak and a pair of heavy goggles. He carries &quot;his sugar&quot; with him at all times. Because his mother consumed too much sugar during her pregnancy, he was born with the power to mutate at will, defeating his enemies by becoming his enemies.
* Trash: Francis &amp; Buzz – Two deformed hand puppets converse.
* Weird Love – A man discovers that his girlfriend is a were–caterpillar
* Mobius in the world of the Living Dead
* Babe in a Bottle(subtitled) – A tiny woman and a doctor.
* Limbo Lounge - Sammy Davis Jr., Sulu and a transvestite perform a night club act.
* Hog Man&#x27;s Pork n&#x27; Bean Emporium – A strange man sells pork n&#x27; beans from a drive-up window.

==Controversy==
The show was banned in Philadelphia and Wisconsin for broadcasting a stop-motion animated short about a squirrel defecating massively.

==Awards==
*The shows (now defunct) website &quot;www.weird.tv&quot; was nominated for 3 Webby Awards in 2006, under the categories of Best Humor, Best Use of Animation or Graphics and Best Weird.

<doc id="486482" wikidata="Q5374844" url="?curid=486482" title="Emu (puppet)">
<text>Emu is a four-year-old puppet emu which was given to British entertainer Rod Hull in the 1960s while he was presenting a children&#x27;s breakfast television programme in Australia. Hull adopted the mute puppet for his cabaret act, and took it with him to the United Kingdom when he returned in 1970. The character was given a mischievous and sometimes aggressive onstage persona, attacking celebrity guests (and Hull himself) for comic effect, notably on Michael Parkinson&#x27;s chat show in 1976. Hull and Emu also appeared on several episodes of The Hudson Brothers&#x27; comedy show in the United States.
==History==
===1970s and 1980s television series===
During the 1970s, Hull and Emu achieved national fame in the UK with their BBC series &quot;Emu&#x27;s Broadcasting Company&quot;. The duo moved to ITV in the 1980s, where a succession of shows was produced concerning their ongoing rivalry with Grotbags, a witch played by Carol Lee Scott.

=== 2000s revival ===
A new series, simply titled &quot;Emu&quot;, with Toby Hull replacing his father (who had died in 1999), was produced in Belfast and broadcast on ITV in 2007. A second series was produced in New Zealand and broadcast in 2009.

<doc id="486485" wikidata="Q181728" url="?curid=486485" title="Eliezer Ben-Yehuda">
<text>Eliezer Ben‑Yehuda (born Eliezer Yitzhak Perlman; 7 January 1858 – 16 December 1922) was a Russian–Jewish linguist, lexicographer, and journalist who immigrated to Jerusalem in 1881, when it was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. He is renowned as the lexicographer of the first Hebrew dictionary and also as the editor of Jerusalem-based &quot;HaZvi&quot;, one of the first Hebrew newspapers published in the Land of Israel. Ben-Yehuda was the primary driving force behind the revival of the Hebrew language.

==Early life and education==

Eliezer Yitzhak Perlman (later Eliezer Ben-Yehuda) was born in Luzhki in the Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Vitebsk Oblast, Belarus) to Yehuda Leib and Tzipora Perlman, who were Chabad &quot;hasidim&quot;. His native language was Yiddish. He attended a Jewish elementary school (a &quot;cheder&quot;) where he studied Hebrew and the Hebrew Bible from the age of three, as was customary among the Jews of Eastern Europe. By the age of twelve, he had read large portions of the Torah, Mishna, and Talmud. His mother and uncle hoped he would become a rabbi, and sent him to a yeshiva. There he was exposed to the Hebrew of the Jewish Enlightenment, which included some secular writings. Later, he learned French, German, and Russian, and was sent to Dünaburg for further education. Reading the Hebrew-language newspaper &quot;HaShahar&quot;, he became acquainted with the early movement of Zionism.

Upon graduation in 1877, Ben-Yehuda went to Paris for four years. While there, he studied various subjects at the Sorbonne University—including the history and politics of the Middle East. It was in Paris that he met a Jew from Jerusalem, who spoke Hebrew with him. It was this conversation that convinced him that the revival of Hebrew as the language of a nation was feasible.

===Immigration to The Land of Israel===
In 1881 Ben-Yehuda joined the First Aliyah and immigrated to The Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, then ruled by the Ottoman Empire, and settled in Jerusalem. He found a job teaching at the school of the Alliance Israélite Universelle. Motivated by the surrounding ideals of renovation and rejection of the diaspora lifestyle, Ben-Yehuda set out to develop a new language that could replace Yiddish and other regional dialects as a means of everyday communication between Jews who moved to the Land of Israel from various regions of the world. Ben-Yehuda regarded Hebrew and Zionism as symbiotic, writing, &quot;the Hebrew language can live only if we revive the nation and return it to the fatherland.&quot;

==Revival of the Hebrew language==
To accomplish the task, Ben-Yehuda insisted with the Committee of the Hebrew Language that, to quote the Committee records, &quot;In order to supplement the deficiencies of the Hebrew language, the Committee coins words according to the rules of grammar and linguistic analogy from Semitic roots: Aramaic and especially from Arabic roots.&quot;

In 1903 Ben-Yehuda, along with many members of the Second Aliyah, supported Theodor Herzl&#x27;s Uganda Scheme proposal.

Ben‑Yehuda raised his son, Ben-Zion (meaning &quot;son of Zion&quot;), entirely in Hebrew. He did not allow his son to be exposed to other languages during childhood, and even berated his wife for singing a Russian lullaby. His son thus became the first native speaker of Hebrew in modern times. Ben‑Yehuda later raised his daughter, Dola, entirely in Hebrew as well.

===Lexicography===
Ben-Yehuda was a major figure in the establishment of the Committee of the Hebrew Language (Va&#x27;ad HaLashon), later the Academy of the Hebrew Language, an organization that still exists today. He was the initiator of the first modern Hebrew dictionary known as the Ben-Yehuda Dictionary and he became known as the &quot;reviver&quot; (המחיה) of the Hebrew language, despite opposition to some of the words he coined. Many of these words have become part of the language but others never caught on.

Ancient languages and modern Standard Arabic were major sources for Ben-Yehuda and the Committee. According to Joshua Blau, quoting the criteria insisted on by Ben-Yehuda: &quot;In order to supplement the deficiencies of the Hebrew language, the Committee coins words according to the rules of grammar and linguistic analogy from Semitic roots: Aramaic, Canaanite, Egyptian [sic] ones and especially from Arabic roots.&quot; Concerning Arabic, Ben-Yehuda maintained, inaccurately according to Blau, that Arabic roots are &quot;ours&quot;: &quot;the roots of Arabic were once a part of the Hebrew language ... lost, and now we have found them again!&quot;

===Opposition from Orthodox Jews===
Ben-Yehuda was the editor of several Hebrew-language newspapers: &quot;HaZvi and&quot; &quot;Hashkafa.&quot; &quot;HaZvi&quot; was closed down for a year in the wake of opposition from Jerusalem&#x27;s ultra-Orthodox community, which fiercely objected to the use of Hebrew, their holy tongue, for everyday conversation. In 1908, its name changed to &quot;HaOr&quot;, and it was shut down by the Ottoman government during World War I due its support for a Jewish homeland in the Land of Israel/Palestine.

Many devoted Jews of the time did not appreciate Ben-Yehuda&#x27;s efforts to resurrect the Hebrew language. They believed that Hebrew, which they learned as a biblical language, should not be used to discuss mundane and non-holy things. Others thought his son would grow up and become a &quot;disabled idiot&quot;, and even Theodor Herzl declared, after meeting Ben-Yehuda, that the thought of Hebrew becoming the modern language of the Jews was ridiculous.

In December 1893, Ben-Yehuda and his father-in-law were imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in Jerusalem following accusations by members of the Jewish community that they were inciting rebellion against the government.

==Personal life==
Ben-Yehuda was married twice, to two sisters. His first wife, Devora (née Jonas), died in 1891 of tuberculosis, leaving him with five small children. Her final wish was that Eliezer marry her younger sister, Paula Beila. Soon after his wife Devora&#x27;s death, three of his children died of diphtheria within a period of 10 days. Six months later, he married Paula, who took the Hebrew name &quot;Hemda&quot;. 

Hemda Ben-Yehuda became an accomplished journalist and author in her own right, ensuring the completion of the Hebrew dictionary in the decades after Eliezer&#x27;s death, as well as mobilising fundraising and coordinating committees of scholars in both Israel and abroad.

==Death and legacy==
In December 1922, Ben-Yehuda, 64, died of tuberculosis, from which he suffered most of his life. He was buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. His funeral was attended by 30,000 people.

Ben-Yehuda built a house for his family in the Talpiot neighborhood of Jerusalem, but died three months before it was completed. His wife Hemda lived there for close to thirty years. Ten years after her death, her son Ehud transferred the title of the house to the Jerusalem municipality for the purpose of creating a museum and study center. Eventually it was leased to a church group from Germany who established a center there for young German volunteers. The house is now a conference center and guesthouse run by the German organization Action Reconciliation Service for Peace (ARSP), which organizes workshops, seminars and Hebrew language ulpan programs.

Cecil Roth was quoted by historian Jack Fellman as having summed up Ben-Yehuda&#x27;s contribution to the Hebrew language: &quot;Before Ben‑Yehuda, Jews could speak Hebrew; after him, they did.&quot; This comment reflects the fact that there are no other examples of a natural language without any native speakers subsequently acquiring several million native speakers, and no other examples of a sacred language becoming a national language with millions of &quot;first language&quot; speakers.

<text>OSEK (&quot;Offene Systeme und deren Schnittstellen für die Elektronik in Kraftfahrzeugen&quot;; English: &quot;Open Systems and their Interfaces for the Electronics in Motor Vehicles&quot;) is a standards body that has produced specifications for an embedded operating system, a communications stack, and a network management protocol for automotive embedded systems. It has produced related specifications, namely AUTOSAR. OSEK was designed to provide a reliable standard software architecture for the various electronic control units (ECUs) throughout a car.

OSEK was founded in 1993 by a German automotive company consortium (BMW, Robert Bosch GmbH, DaimlerChrysler, Opel, Siemens, and Volkswagen Group) and the University of Karlsruhe. In 1994, the French cars manufacturers Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroën, which had a similar project called VDX (Vehicle Distributed eXecutive), joined the consortium. Therefore, the official name was OSEK/VDX and OSEK was registered trademark of Continental Automotive GmbH (until 2007: Siemens AG).

== Standards ==

OSEK is an open standard, published by a consortium founded by the automobile industry. Some parts of OSEK are standardized in ISO 17356.

* ISO 17356-1:2005 Road vehicles—Open interface for embedded automotive applications—Part 1: General structure and terms, definitions and abbreviated terms
* ISO 17356-2:2005 Road vehicles—Open interface for embedded automotive applications—Part 2: OSEK/VDX specifications for binding OS, COM and NM
* ISO 17356-3:2005 Road vehicles—Open interface for embedded automotive applications—Part 3: OSEK/VDX Operating System (OS)

== OSEK Functioning ==
The OSEK standard specifies interfaces to multitasking functions—generic I/O and peripheral access—and thus remains architecture dependent. OSEK is expected to run on microcontroller without memory management unit (MMU), which is favored for safety-critical systems such as cars, therefore features of an OSEK implementation will be usually configured at compile-time. The number of application tasks, stacks, mutexes, etc. is statically configured; it is not possible to create more at run time. OSEK recognizes two types of tasks/threads/compliance levels: basic tasks and enhanced tasks. Basic tasks never block; they &quot;run to completion&quot; (coroutine). Enhanced tasks can sleep and block on event objects. The events can be triggered by other tasks (basic and enhanced) or interrupt routines. Only static priorities are allowed for tasks. First In First Out (FIFO) scheduling is used for tasks with equal priority. Deadlocks and priority inversion are prevented by priority ceiling (i.e. no priority inheritance).

The specification uses ISO/ANSI-C-like syntax; however, the implementation language of the system services is not specified. An Application Binary Interface (ABI) is also not specified.

OSEK-OS scheduling can be configured as:

* Preemptive, a task can always be preempted by means of a higher priority task
* Non-preemptive, a task can only be preempted in prefixed compile-time points (cooperative scheduling)
* Mixed mode scheduling
* Groups of tasks (cooperative)

== State of the art ==

=== AUTOSAR ===
Currently the AUTOSAR consortium reuses the OSEK specifications as part of the Classic Platform.

The operating system is a backwards compatible superset of OSEK OS which also covers the functionality of &quot;OSEKtime&quot;, and the communication module is derived from OSEK COM. &quot;OSEKtime&quot; specifies a standard for optional time-triggered real-time operating systems. If used, &quot;OSEKtime&quot; triggered callbacks run with higher priority than OSEK tasks.

=== Research ===
There is also a limited amount of active research, e. g. in the area of systems engineering and OSEK / VDX RTOS or in relation to the compatibility between OSEK and AUTOSAR.

=== Quality ===
In a 48-page report from 2003 by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), the specifications were examined and possible weaknesses in the areas of alarm and event mechanisms were identified with possible solutions. The potential of OSEK was also mentioned.

==Implementations==
Note: A limited number of implementations and vendors exist. Most products are only commercially sold and licensed, others are freely available with open-source license for a limited number of controllers. See also: Comparison of real-time operating systems.
=== Open-source derivates ===
&quot;Note: Open-source developments are often very limited in scope (targets, conformance classes, characteristics) and are not verified against the specifications unless told otherwise.&quot;

<text>The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) is a weekly medical journal published by the Massachusetts Medical Society. Founded in 1812, the journal is among the most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals. Its 2023 impact factor was 96.2, ranking it 2nd out of 168 journals in the category &quot;Medicine, General &amp; Internal&quot;.

==History==
In September 1811, Boston physician John Collins Warren, along with James Jackson, submitted a formal prospectus to establish the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery and Collateral Branches of Science&quot; as a medical and philosophical journal. Subsequently, the first issue of the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery and the Collateral Branches of Medical Science&quot; was published in January 1812. The journal was published quarterly.

In 1823, another publication, the &quot;Boston Medical Intelligencer&quot;, appeared under the editorship of Jerome V. C. Smith.

The editors of the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery and the Collateral Branches of Medical Science&quot; purchased the weekly &quot;Intelligencer&quot; for $600 in 1828, merging the two publications to form the &quot;Boston Medical and Surgical Journal&quot;, and shifting from quarterly to weekly publication.

In 1921, the Massachusetts Medical Society purchased the &quot;Journal&quot; for US$1 () and, in 1928, renamed it to &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;.

== Logo ==
The journal&#x27;s logo depicts the snake-wrapped Rod of Asclepius crossed over a quill pen. The dates on the logo represent the founding of the components of &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;: 1812 for the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery and Collateral Branches of Medical Science&quot;, 1823 for the &quot;Boston Medical Intelligencer&quot;, 1828 for the &quot;Boston Medical and Surgical Journal&quot;, and 1928 for the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;.

==Notable articles==
Notable articles from the course of &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; history include:

* In November 1846, the New England Journal of Medicine published a report by Henry Jacob Bigelow on the first public demonstration of a generalized anesthetic. The agent was inhaled ether, the first modern anesthetic. This allowed patients to remain sedated during operations ranging from dental extraction to amputation. &quot;A patient has been rendered completely insensible during an amputation of the thigh, regain consciousness after a short interval,&quot; Bigelow wrote. &quot;Other severe operations have been performed without the knowledge of the patients.&quot;
* In June 1906, James Homer Wright published an article that described how he stained and studied bone marrow with descriptions of what are now known as megakaryocytes and platelets.
* In October 1872, a lecture by Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard was published that proposed the then-revolutionary idea that one cerebral hemisphere can influence both sides of the body. The neurologist would go on to describe what is now known as the Brown-Séquard syndrome.
* In June 1948, Sidney Farber reported promising results in treatment of early childhood leukemia. Based on anecdotal evidence that children with acute leukemia worsened if they were given folic acid, he worked on blocking folic acid metabolism. His team gave 16 infants and children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia a folic acid inhibitor, aminopterin—10 showed improvement by clinical and hematologic parameters after three months. In his article, Farber advised receiving the results cautiously: &quot;It is again emphasized that these remissions are temporary in character and that the substance is toxic and may be productive of even greater disturbances than have been encountered so far in our studies,&quot; he wrote. &quot;No evidence has been mentioned in this report that would justify the suggestion of the term &#x27;cure&#x27; of acute leukemia in children.&quot;
* In November 1952, cardiologist Paul Zoll published an early report on resuscitation of the heart. &quot;The purpose of this report is to describe the successful use in 2 patients of a quick, simple, effective and safe method of arousing the heart from ventricular standstill by an artificial, external, electric pacemaker&quot;, he wrote. &quot;For the first time it was possible to keep a patient alive during ventricular asystole lasting for hours to days. This procedure may prove valuable in many clinical situations.&quot;
* In February 1973, &quot;NEJM&quot; published the first report of polyp removal using a colonoscope and introduced a procedure during screening to reduce cancer risk. The authors reported on 218 patients, from whom they removed 303 polyps (at one or more procedures per patient).
* A letter published in the &quot;NEJM&quot; in 1980 was later described by the journal as having been &quot;heavily and uncritically cited&quot; to claim that addiction due to use of opioids was rare, and its publication in such an authoritative journal was used by pharmaceutical companies to push widespread use of opioid drugs, leading to an addiction crisis in the U.S. and other countries.
* In December 1981, two landmark articles described the clinical course of four patients—first reported in the CDC&#x27;s June 1981 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report—with the disease that would come to be known as AIDS.
* In April 2001, Brian Druker et al. reported a targeted therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia. Based on the knowledge that BCR-ABL, a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase, causes CML, the authors tested with success an inhibitor of this tyrosine kinase in patients who had failed first-line therapy. The finding helped begin the era of designing cancer drugs to target specific molecular abnormalities.
* In October 2020, the journal published an editorial, signed by all 34 editors, in which they condemned the Trump administration&#x27;s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic saying that &quot;they are dangerously incompetent&quot; and that &quot;they have taken a crisis and turned it into a tragedy.&quot; This is the first time &quot;NEJM&quot; has ever supported or condemned a political candidate and only three other times in history has an editorial been signed by all the editors.
*In April 2021, Robin Carhart-Harris et al. demonstrated that in the pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorder, there was no significant difference in antidepressant effects between the psychedelic drug psilocybin and the SSRI escitalopram after six weeks. Significant doses of psilocybin were only administered twice in the six-week period, while escitalopram was taken daily. This was the first time psychedelics and SSRIs were compared in the treatment of depression.

== Social media ==
On April 25, 1996, the &quot;NEJM&quot; announced a new web site, which published each week the abstracts for research articles and the full text of editorials, cases, and letters to the editor. After print publishing for 184 years this was the &quot;NEJM&quot;″s first use of the Internet for electronic publication.

The site was launched several months earlier in 1996, but the editors wanted proof that weekly electronic publication would work. Only then was an announcement approved for publication on the editorial page. In 1997, the website included prepublication releases of certain articles prior to their print publication. In 1998, online publication extended to include the full text of all its articles from 1993 forward.

Since its launch, &quot;NEJM&quot; has added to its site:

* Videos in Clinical Medicine, peer-reviewed educational videos to teach procedures requiring skilled techniques and specialized physical examination.
* Interactive Medical Cases, which mimic a clinical encounter by presenting the patient&#x27;s history with results of the physical examination and laboratory and radiographic tests. Multiple-choice questions throughout test the taker&#x27;s knowledge.
* NEJM Archive, the entire collection of the journal&#x27;s published material.

==Influence==
The George Polk Awards site noted that its 1977 award to &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;: &quot;...provided the first significant mainstream visibility for a publication that would achieve enormous attention and prestige in the ensuing decades.&quot;

The journal usually has the highest impact factor of the journals of internal medicine. According to the Journal Citation Reports, &quot;NEJM&quot; had a 2017 impact factor of 79.258, ranking it first of 153 journals in the category &quot;General &amp; Internal Medicine&quot;. It was the only journal in the category with an impact factor of more than 70. By comparison, the second and third ranked journals in the category (&quot;The Lancet&quot; and &quot;JAMA&quot;) had impact factors of 53.254 and 47.661 respectively.

Theodore Dalrymple feels that this influence is unwarranted. In &quot;False Positive: A Year of Error, Omission, and Political Correctness in the New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, he examines various articles on medical and social issues that the &quot;NEJM&quot; published over the course of a year. He found that many arrived at conclusions which were not supported by the evidence presented, or ignored easily available evidence that contradicted their conclusions.

== Specialty journals ==
In 2022, NEJM set up a new sub-journal, &quot;NEJM Evidence&quot;. NEJM Evidence is a monthly digital journal featuring original research. It focuses on clinical trials and decision making. 

==Ingelfinger rule==
&quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; requires that articles it publishes have not been published or released elsewhere. Referred to as the Ingelfinger rule, the policy is intended to protect newsworthiness, and to subject research to peer review &quot;before it is touted to the public or the profession&quot;. By 1991, four types of exceptions were recognized, including when &quot;prepublication release of research conclusions is warranted because of immediate implications for the public health&quot;.

The rule was first described in a 1969 editorial, &quot;Definition of Sole Contribution&quot;, by Franz Ingelfinger, the editor-in-chief at that time. A number of medical journals have similar rules in place.

==Vioxx correction controversy==
In the early 2000s, &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; was involved in a controversy around problems with research on the drug Vioxx. A study was published in the journal in November 2000 which noted an increase in myocardial infarction amongst those taking Vioxx. According to Richard Smith, the former editor of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, concerns about the correctness of that study were raised with the journal&#x27;s editor, Jeff Drazen, as early as August 2001. That year, both the US Food and Drug Administration and the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; also cast doubt on the validity of the data interpretation that had been published in the &quot;NEJM&quot;. Merck withdrew the drug from market in September 2004. In December 2005, &quot;NEJM&quot; published an expression of concern about the original study following discovery that the authors knew more about certain adverse events than they disclosed at the time of publication. From the Expression of Concern: &quot;Until the end of November 2005, we believed that these were late events that were not known to the authors in time to be included in the article published in the Journal on November 23, 2000. It now appears, however, from a memorandum dated July 5, 2000, that was obtained by subpoena in the Vioxx litigation and made available to the Journal, that at least two of the authors knew about the three additional myocardial infarctions at least two weeks before the authors submitted the first of two revisions and 4 1/2 months before publication of the article.&quot; During the five-year period between publication and Expression of Concern, it has been estimated that Merck paid &quot;NEJM&quot; as much as US$836,000 for article reprints that Merck used for promotional purposes. The journal was publicly rebuked for its response to the research issues in editorials appearing in publications including the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; and the &quot;Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine&quot;.

==Open access policy==
NEJM makes articles that meet the criteria for global and public health importance freely available to all readers upon publication at NEJM.org. NEJM also partners with Research4Life in their Access to Research in Health (Hinari) program to grant to low-income countries immediate free access to NEJM.org.

NEJM does not charge authors any submission or publication fees. NEJM also works with authors whose articles report research supported by funding bodies with open access mandates, including (but not limited to) Plan S funders and the U.S. government, including NIH, to ensure that authors are able to meet their funders’ requirements for public access to research results.

For research articles submitted before February 1, 2024, NEJM makes the full-text Version of Record available at NEJM.org six months after publication. For research articles submitted on or after February 1, 2024, NEJM will provide authors with a PDF file of the Author Accepted Manuscript that may be deposited in a noncommercial repository after publication.

&quot;NEJM&quot; also has two podcast features, one with interviews of doctors and researchers that are publishing in the journal, and another summarizing the content of each issue.

<text>Action semantics is a framework for the formal specification of semantics of programming languages invented by David Watt and Peter D. Mosses in the 1990s. It is a mixture of denotational, operational and algebraic semantics.

Action semantics aim to be pragmatic, and action-semantic descriptions (ASDs) are designed to scale up to handle realistic programming languages. This is aided by the extensibility and modifiability of ASDs. This helps to ensure that extensions and changes do not require too many changes in the description. This is in contrast to the typical case when extending denotational or operational semantics, which may require reformulation of the entire description.

The action semantics framework was originally developed at the University of Aarhus and the University of Glasgow. Groups and individuals around the world have since contributed further to the approach.

==Semantic entities==
An important part of action semantics that gives it a modularity not seen in previous programming language semantics is the use of first-order semantic entities. First-order refers to how, unlike in denotational semantics, where a semantic function can be applied to another semantic function, in action semantics, a semantic entity cannot be applied to another semantic entity of its kind. Furthermore, the semantic entities utilized by action semantics broaden the framework’s ability to describe a programming language’s constructs by serving to denote both program behavior that is independent of any particular implementation and the way in which parts of a program influence the overall performance of the whole. The appropriately named action notation is employed to express the three types of semantic entities found in action semantics: &quot;actions&quot;, &quot;data&quot;, and &quot;yielders&quot;. The central semantic entity in this framework is actions, with data and yielders occupying supplementary roles. More specifically, actions are the mechanisms through which yielders and data are processed. An action, which can occur within another action, is a step-by-step representation of program behavior, where each step accesses current information, changes current information, or does both. Yielders appear within actions and only access current information. A yielder entity is capable of being evaluated, and when it is, the product is a datum entity.

==Action entities==
Action entities can directly represent programs’ semantics by describing possible program behaviors or represent, in a more indirect way, the impact that individual pieces of a program, like statements or expressions, have on the semantics of the program as a whole. They model computational behavior by indicating changes in state through their generation of new values from passed values. Specifically, an action accepts data passed to it via the current information — the transient data given to it, the bindings received by it, and the current state of storage — and, from this, gives new transient data, creates new bindings, updates the state of storage, or any combination of these. An action entity can culminate in four possible ways. It can: &quot;complete&quot; (terminate normally), &quot;escape&quot; (terminate in an exception), &quot;fail&quot; (alternative is discarded), or &quot;diverge&quot; (not terminate).

There are four categories of information that are processed by action performance. &quot;Transient information&quot; corresponds to intermediate results and is accessible for immediate use by the action. The data that comprises transient information encompasses the values given by expressions. If these values are not immediately used, they are lost. &quot;Scoped information&quot; corresponds to symbol tables and can be referenced from anywhere within the action and its sub-actions. It is also possible for such information to be hidden within a sub-action, via the creation of an inner scope, in which case it would be only locally accessible within that scope, to that sub-action. &quot;Stable information&quot; corresponds to values assigned to variables and can be modified in the action performance. Because alterations to storage during the performance of an action are persistent, only explicit actions can cause such modifications. In accordance with this, stable information is available until it is explicitly destroyed. And, unlike scoped information, it cannot be hidden. &quot;Permanent information&quot; corresponds to data exchanged between actions and can be extended but not modified. Transient information is produced only when an action completes or escapes, and scoped information is produced only when an action completes. The modification of stable information and the extension of permanent information must take place during action performance.

An action entity has five different facets, one for processing that does not rely on information, and four for processing each of the four different types of information. The &quot;basic&quot; facet, an example of which would be control flows, is not tied to information of any kind. The &quot;functional&quot; facet deals with the processing of transient information and is characterized by actions giving and accepting data. The &quot;declarative&quot; facet deals with the processing of scoped information and is characterized by actions creating and receiving bindings. The &quot;imperative&quot; facet deals with the processing of stable information and is characterized by actions allocating and freeing storage cells, and fetching and modifying the data stored in them. The &quot;communicative&quot; facet deals with processing permanent information and is characterized by actions sending and receiving messages and “offer[ing] contracts to agents.” There are two different kinds of actions in terms of their effect on the information in each facet. &quot;Primitive actions&quot; only affect the information in one facet. Action &quot;combinators&quot; permit actions that involve multiple facets, governing how control and information flows for each facet involved in a combined action. In combining actions, action combinators governor the sequencing of sub-action performances and the incoming and outgoing flows of data for each sub-action.

==Data entities==
Data entities are the items that comprise the information processed in action entities. The data is arranged into structures known as sorts. Sorts are sets of mathematical objects, include operations that can be performed on those objects, and are defined according to algebraic criteria. These structures allow access to each individual entity. Examples of data entities can include concrete elements like maps, lists, sets, strings, characters, numbers, and truth values, more abstract elements used solely for the purpose of some computational operation, namely data access, like agents, cells corresponding to memory locations, and tokens, or elements like contracts and messages that are a composite of data components. An &quot;abstraction&quot; is a data entity that encapsulates an action entity, in which case enacting the abstraction results in the action being performed. This is the technique by which action semantics represents the declaring and invoking of subprograms.
==Yielder entities==
Yielder entities consist of unevaluated quantities of data. The values of these quantities are contingent on the current information and state of computation. Yielders draw on transient data, bindings, and storage to select the information to be processed by actions. It is during action performance that yielders are evaluated, and their evaluation results in data entities. While the current information can influence the data produced by the evaluation of a yielder entity, the evaluation cannot influence the current information. If data operations are employed on yielder entities, compound yielder entities may be formed as a result.

==Action notation==
Regular English words serve as the symbols of action notation. Action notation is designed to simulate natural language, which is illustrated in the parts of speech used to denote semantic entities. Action entities are represented by verb phrases and data and yielder entities by noun phrases. The result of this choice of symbols is a framework that is highly readable and no less formal than other frameworks since it remains precisely defined.

==Other key aspects==
Action semantics embodies a level of abstraction that increases its comprehensibility. The specifics of the control and data flows that an action involves are implicitly incorporated in the action, as opposed to being explicitly expressed as the details of semantic functions are in denotational semantics. When an action is performed, most information processing and manipulation occurs automatically.

Program phrases are mapped to actions when constructing a definition of a programming language’s meaning in action semantics. The execution of a programming phrase corresponds to the performance of the action to which it maps.

The programming language specification generated from the application of action semantics can be broken down into a lower level (&quot;microsemantics&quot;) and an upper level (&quot;macrosemantics&quot;). The lower level consists of defining the meaning of action notation, while the upper level consists of defining the meaning of a programming language, using action notation to do so.

<doc id="486494" wikidata="Q607440" url="?curid=486494" title="CD+G">
<text>CD+G (also known as CD-G, CD+Graphics and TV-Graphics) is an extension of the compact disc standard that can present low-resolution graphics alongside the audio data on the disc when played on a compatible device. CD+G discs are often used for karaoke machines, which use this functionality to present on-screen lyrics for the song contained on the disc. The CD+G specifications were published by Philips and Sony as an extension of the Red Book (CD standard) specifications.

The first CD to be released with CD+G graphics was &quot;Eat or Be Eaten&quot; by Firesign Theatre in 1985. The [[#Improvements|CD+EG]] is a similar format that allows for better graphics, but has very rarely been implemented in releases.

== Design ==
The CD+G format takes advantage of the six Compact Disc subcode channels R through W (which are unused in standard Compact Disc Digital Audio), to provide 6 extra bits in CD+G for graphics information per 24 bytes of audio data. When a disc is read at normal speed, these six channels provide only 28.8 kbit/s for graphics, which is enough to provide primitive visuals but which is dwarfed by modern bitrates (for comparison see ).

In the CD+G system, 16-color (4-bit) raster graphics are constructed using tiled rendering with 6×12 pixel tiles (6 pixels wide and 12 lines high). These tiles are typically font definitions for text (such as for karaoke or info about the music). But the tiles can be used in any manner that tile rending permits, such as for fragments which combine together to represent a picture, or simply for patterns to decorate the background. These tiles are displayed in the main central 288×192 pixel area which is surrounded by a 1-tile thick border (for a total raster field of 300×216 pixels). The 16 colors are defined in a color table, which can be manipulated to change the color scheme and simulate primitive animations.

=== Instruction set ===
The main instructions for manipulating graphics are:
* Memory Preset: Set the screen to a particular color.
* Border Preset: Set the border of the screen to a particular color.
* Tile Block (Normal): Load a 12×6 tile, 2 color tile and display it normally.
* Scroll Preset: Scroll the image, filling in the new area with a color.
* Scroll Copy: Scroll the image, rotating the bits back around.
* Define Transparent Color: Define a specific color as being transparent.
* Load Color Table (entries 0–7): Load in the lower 8 entries of the color table.
* Load Color Table (entries 8–15): Load in the upper 8 entries of the color table.
* Tile Block (XOR): Load a 12×6 tile, 2 color tile and display it using the XOR method.

== Improvements ==
Compact Disc + Extended Graphics (CD+EG, also known as CD+XG and Extended TV-Graphics) is an improved variant of the Compact Disc + Graphics (CD+G) format. Like CD+G, CD+EG utilizes basic audio CD features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played. This extra data is stored in the subcode channels R-W. Very few CD+EG discs have been published.
* 288 pixels per line
* 192 lines
* up to 256 colors

== Usage ==
Along with dedicated karaoke machines, other consumer devices that play CD+G format CDs include the NEC TurboGrafx-CD (a CD-ROM peripheral for the TurboGrafx-16) and Turbo Duo, as well as the Japan-only successor the PC-FX, the Philips CD-i, the Sega CD, Sega Saturn, the JVC X&#x27;Eye, the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, the Amiga CD32 and Commodore CDTV, and the Atari Jaguar CD (an attachment for the Atari Jaguar). Some CD-ROM drives can also read this data. Pioneer&#x27;s LaserActive player can also play CD+G discs, as long as either the PAC-S1/S-10 or PAC-N1/N10 game modules are installed.

Since 2003, some standalone DVD players have supported the CD+G format. Regular audio CD players will output only the audio tracks as if it was a normal music CD, unless otherwise designed to read the extra data (lyrics and images).

CD+G karaoke albums are still made today by several UK and US manufacturers including Sunfly, Zoom Entertainments, SBI Karaoke and Vocal Star. Although the popularity of CD sales are dwindling the format is still widely used as MP3+G downloads.

==Notable releases==

Although CD+G found its market in karaoke entertainment, some music labels were keen to experiment with the format and a number of albums were released which featured graphic images, animations and text. These special edition CD+G releases are now very rare and have become collectible items as a result. Some albums released include:

* Alphaville – &quot;The Breathtaking Blue&quot;
* Anita Baker – &quot;Rapture&quot;
* Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash – &quot;Live It Up&quot;
* Fleetwood Mac – &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;
* The Jimi Hendrix Experience – &quot;Smash Hits&quot;
* Information Society – &quot;Information Society&quot;
* Chris Isaak – &quot;Silvertone&quot;
* Laura Branigan – &quot;Laura Branigan&quot;
* Little Feat – &quot;Representing the Mambo&quot;
* Lou Reed – &quot;New York&quot;
* Simply Red – &quot;Picture Book&quot;
* Donna Summer – &quot;Another Place and Time&quot;
* Talking Heads – &quot;Naked&quot;
Daiichi Kosho is a former karaoke music manufacturer and their high-quality edit-a-vision range of 99 CD+Gs is still highly sought after by karaoke presenters today.

CD+G karaoke CDs are often ripped onto computer hard drives as MP3+G, with the audio encoded in the standard audio format, MP3, and the graphics encoded in a RAW format. These can then be played on computers using VLC media player, Karafun, or professionally by DJs and karaoke presenters using software such as Karma or Atomix VirtualDJ often in conjunction with a DJ controller manufactured by Pioneer, Denon, Roland or Numark.

<text>West Norwood Cemetery is a rural cemetery in West Norwood in London, England. It was also known as the South Metropolitan Cemetery.
One of the first private landscaped cemeteries in London, it is one of the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; cemeteries of London, and is a site of major historical, architectural and ecological interest.

Its grounds are a mixture of historic monumental cemetery and modern lawn cemetery, but it also has catacombs, cremation plots and a columbarium for cinerary ashes. The cemetery&#x27;s crematorium still operates, but all the conventional and cremated remains burial plots have been allocated and hence it is closed to new burials pending further agreement under current burial legislation.

==Location==
The Main gate is located on Norwood Road near the junction with Robson Road, where Norwood Road forks into Norwood High Street and Knights&#x27; Hill. It is in the London Borough of Lambeth (SE27). The local authority is the current owner. The site, with some of its neighbouring streets, forms part of a conservation area.

==Site==
Believed by some to hold the finest collection of sepulchral monuments in London, the cemetery features 69 Grade II and Grade II* listed buildings and structures, including a dedicated Greek Orthodox necropolis with 19 listed mausoleums and monuments. It is one of the Magnificent Seven metropolitan lawn cemeteries of the Victorian era, and its extensive Gothic Revival architecture qualifies it as one of the significant cemeteries in Europe.

Lambeth Council have recognised it as a site of nature conservation value within the Borough in addition to its outstanding value as a site of national historic and cultural interest. English Heritage have placed it on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens, describing it as the first cemetery to be designed in the Gothic Revival style. The entrance gate is set within railings, painted a historically accurate &#x27;spice&#x27; brown. Railings and walls were kept high to dispel fears of body snatchers. There is a second entrance nearby, normally kept locked, in Norwood High Street which is close to West Norwood railway station.
It is a mixture of cleared, manicured, and mature landscaping, and includes Anglican and unconsecrated burial grounds, a crematorium, memorial gardens, columbarium, recordia, chapel, vaults and catacombs on top of a gently rolling hill, with views across south London. The larger plots on the central higher ground and by the main drives were originally sold as prime locations and are the site of some of the grander Anglican monuments and mausolea, while the Greek Orthodox necropolis in the North East contains a high density of neoclassical architecture.

Many of these mausolea are listed, such as the Grade II mausoleum for Sir Henry Doulton&#x27;s family, constructed appropriately of pottery and terracotta. As a contrast, just a few yards to the west of the crematorium is the very simple headstone to Isabella Mary Mayson Beeton, aka Mrs Beeton, the Victorian cookery writer.

==History==
The cemetery was founded by its own Act of Parliament of 1836 and consecrated for its first burials in 1837. By 2000, there had been 164,000 burials in 42,000 plots, plus 34,000 cremations and several thousand interments in its catacombs &quot;(see also Catacombs of London)&quot;.

As early as 1711, Sir Christopher Wren advocated the creation of burial grounds on the outskirts of town, &quot;inclosed with a strong Brick Wall, and having a walk round, and two cross walks, decently planted with Yew-trees.&quot; In 1830, George Frederick Carden, editor of &quot;The Penny Magazine&quot;, successfully petitioned Parliament about the parlous state of London&#x27;s over-full church burial yards. Over time they passed a number of laws that effectively halted burials in London&#x27;s churchyards, moving them &#x27;to places where they would be less prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants&#x27;. In 1836, a specific Parliamentary statute enabled the South Metropolitan Cemetery Company to purchase land from the estate of the late Lord Thurlow in what was then called Lower Norwood and create the second of the &#x27;Magnificent Seven&#x27; cemeteries.

The new cemetery was consecrated by the Bishop of Winchester on 7 December 1837, receiving its first burial soon after. Until 1877, the consecrated grounds were overseen by the Diocese of Winchester, and then Rochester, before coming under the authority of Southwark from 1905.

Architect William Tite was a director of the cemetery company and designed the landscaping, some monuments, and was eventually interred there himself.
This was the first cemetery in the UK to be designed in the new Gothic style. It offered a rural setting in open countryside, as it lay outside London at that time. Its design and location attracted the attention of wealthy – and aspirational – Victorians, who commissioned many fine mausoleums and memorials for their burial plots and vaults.

The site of the cemetery was part of the ancient Great North Wood, from which Norwood took its name. Although many trees had been cleared, a number of mature specimens were included in Tite&#x27;s original landscaping. A tree survey of the cemetery in 2005 identified one oak which is thought to date from 1540 to 1640. Fourteen more oaks, a maple and an ash tree were identified that predate the foundation of the cemetery in 1836. In the first years of the cemetery&#x27;s operation, these were joined by coniferous trees and evergreen holm oaks.

===Enclosures===

In 1842, a section of the cemetery was acquired by London&#x27;s Greek community for a Greek Orthodox cemetery, and this soon filled with many fine monuments and large mausoleums, memorialising the history of Anglo-Hellenic families. Grade II*-listed St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel within the Greek section is sometimes attributed to architect John Oldrid Scott. The Greek necropolis is overseen by the trustees of the Cathedral of Saint Sophia.

Another enclosure in the south-east corner was acquired by St Mary-at-Hill in the City of London for its own parish burials.

===More recent history===
The Dissenters&#x27; chapel was damaged by a V-1 flying bomb during World War II and rebuilt in 1956. In 1960 the grand Episcopal chapel was levelled, to be replaced by a memorial rose garden over its catacombs.

The main office at the front of the cemetery was also damaged by another flying bomb; it was rebuilt after the war in a style more sympathetic to its Gothic surroundings.

Between 1978 and 1993, the cemetery achieved several levels of official recognition by being included in the West Norwood Conservation Area, while the entrance arch, the fine railings by Bramah and 64 monuments were listed as Grade II and II*.

However, space for new burials had largely been exhausted by the inter-war years, and, deprived of this regular source of income, the cemetery company was unable to properly afford its upkeep or the repair of buildings damaged by wartime bombing. Lambeth Council compulsorily purchased the cemetery in 1965, and controversially extinguished past rights and claimed ownership over the existing graves. Lambeth changed some of the character of the grounds through &quot;lawn conversion&quot;, removing at least 10,000 monuments (including some of the listed monuments) and restarted new burials, reselling existing plots for re-use. Consistory Court cases fought in the Southwark Diocese in 1995 and 1997 found this to be illegal. It brought about the cessation of new burials and forced the restoration of a handful of the damaged or removed monuments. In addition it required Lambeth to publish an index of cleared and resold plots, so that the descendants of historic owners can identify and request restitution of their family&#x27;s plot.

As a consequence of the courts&#x27; findings, Lambeth now operates the cemetery in accordance with a scheme of management under the joint control of all interested parties, that includes Lambeth, the Diocese, the Friends of West Norwood Cemetery and conservation bodies such as Historic England.

===Crematorium===

While the Anglican catacombs were a popular place for interment, those below the Dissenter&#x27;s chapel remained largely empty. With the rise of the cremation movement the Cemetery Company identified this as a new source of revenue, and chose to rebuild part of the Dissenters&#x27; chapel in 1915 as a crematorium with access from the main hall or/and from the west. A Tousoil Fradet &amp; Cie gas cremator was installed in the basement of the crematorium hall, with its regenerator installed in a vacant portion of the adjacent catacombs. A short length of track led from the basement of the hall into the crematorium for the use of a metal &#x27;introducer&#x27; bier. This furnace was augmented over the next few years by two more cremators, designed by the cemetery superintendent Lockwood and the engineering company of Youngs. This equipment is located entirely underground, and used the original Bramah hydraulic lift of the catacombs to lower the coffin from the Crematorium Chapel at ground level, where a &#x27;marshalling yard&#x27; of narrow gauge railway track allowed the bier to be moved to the correct furnace. After the war, the Dissenter&#x27;s chapel was rebuilt in a more modern style as a crematorium, recordia, and columbarium over its catacombs and furnaces. Its equipment has been updated several times, and its cremators are still used on a daily basis. Lambeth Council does not allow publication of images of the crematorium chapel or cremators on any internet website including Wikipedia.

==Interments and memorials==

A War Memorial in the form of a Cross of Sacrifice is the first memorial a visitor encounters, between the main gate and the inner gate. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission lists 136 Commonwealth war service burials of World War I and 52 of World War II, plus 18 cremations during the latter war. There is also one Belgian war burial and two Greek civilian victims of the &quot;Lusitania&quot; sinking. There are many British and Indian Army officers buried in various parts of the cemetery. Spencer John Bent, Victoria Cross recipient for action in World War I, who was cremated here, is commemorated in a garden of remembrance.

More than 200 people buried in the cemetery are recorded in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;. The Friends of West Norwood Cemetery have recorded and compiled biographies for many more of these with:
* a large number of inventors, engineers, architects, and builders, such as Sir Hiram Maxim, inventor of the automatic machine gun, Sir Henry Bessemer, engineer and inventor of the famous steel process, James Henry Greathead who tunnelled much of the London Underground, William Burges and Sir William Tite, gothic architects
* many artists and entertainers, including: David Roberts, artist, George Stansbury, actor and acrobat George Conquest, composer and operatic singer, William Collingwood Smith, painter, Joseph Barnby, composer and resident conductor at the Royal Albert Hall, Katti Lanner, ballet dancer, Paul Cinquevalli, juggler and actors O. Smith, E. J. Lonnen, Patsy Smart, Maria Zambaco and Mary Brough
* many notable medics, such as: Dr William Marsden, founder of the Royal Free Hospital and The Royal Marsden Hospital, Dr Gideon Mantell, the geologist and pioneering palaeontologist, and Sister Eliza Roberts, Florence Nightingale&#x27;s principal nurse during the Crimean War
* more than twenty Members of Parliament at Westminster including Lord Alverstone (several times Attorney-General) and Lord Chattisham, some Lord Mayors of London and a few Australian settler politicians including Sir George Shenton the first Mayor of Perth
* many sportsmen, including Charles William Alcock, founder of Test cricket and the FA Cup, Georg Hackenschmidt, Anglo-Russian professional wrestler, and Harry Broome, English bare-knuckle boxing champion

There are also many notables of the time, such as Sir Henry Tate, sugar magnate and founder of London&#x27;s Tate Gallery, Arthur Anderson, co-founder of P&amp;O, Paul Julius Baron von Reuter, founder of the news agency, and the Revd. Charles Spurgeon, Baptist preacher, Isabella Beeton (the famous cookery writer), who died at 28 in childbirth, Lloyd Jones, Co-operative Society activist, to name but a few.

The Greek diaspora is well represented, including the Ralli family, Panayis Vagliano, Rodocanachi family, Michalinos Family and Princess Eugenie Palaeologue.

==Reburials and exhumations==
In 1847 some 12,000 remains were taken from the burial vault beneath the Enon Chapel near The Strand, which, after a public health scandal, was bought by George Walker, a prominent surgeon, who had the bodies removed to Norwood Cemetery for reburial in a single mass grave.

In 1969, 11,500 remains were taken from the closed burial ground of St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square in Bayswater, to West Norwood Cemetery and cremated, for burial here.

A Victoria Cross recipient from the Indian Mutiny, South Africa-born Joseph Petrus Hendrik Crowe, was originally buried here in 1876 but following the discovery of his grave in neglected condition his body was exhumed and reburied in his native town of Uitenhage in 1977.

<text>Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. was an American semiconductor manufacturer. It was created by the divestiture of the Semiconductor Products Sector of Motorola in 2004. Freescale focused their integrated circuit products on the automotive, embedded and communications markets. It was bought by a private investor group in 2006, and subsequently merged with NXP Semiconductors in 2015.

==History==

=== Divestiture from Motorola and first IPO ===
As of 2003, Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector earned US$5.0 billion in semiconductor sales in 2002 (out of US$27 billion sales for all of Motorola).

Motorola announced that their semiconductor division would be divested on October 6, 2003 and would have a temporary name &quot;SPS Spinco&quot;.

Freescale completed its Initial public offering (IPO) on July 16, 2004, at a price of US$13. In its announcement, it estimated the stock price to be US$17.50- 19.50 but following a cooling of the market towards tech stocks, it lowered its price to US$13. Existing shareholders of Motorola stock received 0.110415 shares of Freescale stock for every share of Motorola stock as a dividend which was distributed on December 2, 2004.

=== Buyout ===
On September 15, 2006, Freescale agreed to accept a buyout for the sum of $17.6 billion ($40 per share) by a consortium led by the Blackstone Group. Share prices of $13 at the July 2004 IPO had risen to $39.35 in afterhours trading that Friday when the news, rumored that week, broke. A special shareholders meeting on November 13, 2006, voted to accept the buyout offer. The purchase, which closed on December 1, 2006, is reportedly the largest private buyout of a technology company and one of the ten largest buyouts of all time.

=== Second IPO ===
Freescale filed to go public again on February 11, 2011, and completed its IPO on May 26, 2011. Freescale was traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FSL. At the time of the IPO, the company had $7.6 billion in outstanding debt on its books, and the company was investigated for misconduct related to this IPO.

=== MH370 ===
On March 8, 2014, Freescale announced that 20 of its employees were lost aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

===Merger===
A merger agreement with NXP Semiconductors was announced in March 2015, to form a billion company. The acquisition closed on December 7, 2015.

== Products==
=== Automotive ===
A MEMS-based satellite accelerometer, an Airbag System Basis Chip as well as a dual-axis SPI inertial sensor designed for use with the PSI5 open standard airbag systems were announced in 2011. A microcontroller meant to be used in anti-lock braking systems as well as electronic power steering applications was released in 2008. Freescale also produced pressure sensors for engine management systems.

Freescale&#x27;s SMARTMOS analog portfolio provides power actuation and multiple switch detect interface family ICs and system basis chips for hybrid vehicles.

In November 2008 Freescale announced that the company would collaborate with McLaren Electronic Systems to further develop its KERS system for McLaren&#x27;s Formula One car from 2010 onwards. Both parties believed this collaboration would improve McLaren&#x27;s KERS system and help the system filter down to road car technology.

=== Other business units ===
Besides the MSG (Micro-controller Solutions Group), Freescale&#x27;s other major semiconductor businesses are the NMG (Networking and Multimedia Group) as well as RASG (RF, Analog and Sensors Group). Freescale, under the guidance of IBM, had also been a source of PowerPC microprocessors (ICs) for Apple Computer&#x27;s PowerBooks and Mac mini products until the Mac transition to Intel processors in 2006. They joined Power.org in 2006 as a founding member to develop and promote the use of Power Architecture.

DragonBall is a low power derivation of the earlier Motorola 68000 family microprocessors. Freescale also has a portfolio of Digital Signal Processor (DSP) products based on StarCore Technology. Freescale&#x27;s DSPs are being used in Broadband Wireless, Voice Over IP and video infrastructure systems.

== Litigation ==
Freescale was sued by Marvell Semiconductor for infringing seven patents. The case was settled in 2015.

Freescale lost a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Tessera Corporation and was forced to pay an undisclosed amount as part of the settlement.

== Zune bug ==
Clock driver software written by Freescale was responsible for the 2008 Zune leap year bug.

<doc id="486521" wikidata="Q1688483" url="?curid=486521" title="Jet Force Gemini">
<text>Jet Force Gemini is a 1999 third-person shooter developed and published by Rare for the Nintendo 64 video game console. The game follows the story of three members of a galactic law enforcement team as they try to stop a horde of drones led by an insectoid called Mizar. It features a single-player mode where the player must explore a galaxy and save Tribals, a race of survivors who have been enslaved and imprisoned by Mizar, and places strong emphasis on shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. The game includes a multiplayer mode where two to four players can compete in traditional deathmatch games.

Inspired by 80s arcade games and more recent titles of the time, such as &quot;Super Metroid&quot; and &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; blends elements of both shoot &#x27;em up and action-adventure games. Works such as &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot; and &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; were major influences. The game received generally positive reviews from critics. Praise was given to its detailed graphics and life-span, while criticism was targeted at its confusing controls and insistence on having to save every Tribal to fully complete the game. In 2015, &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; was included as part of the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; video game compilation for Xbox One. The game was rereleased via the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2023.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; is a third-person shooter with shoot &#x27;em up and action-adventure elements, in which the player controls the player character from a third-person perspective in a 3D environment. The game places strong emphasis on shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. Weapons have no magazine restrictions and include grenades, a pistol, a machine gun, a sniper rifle, a flamethrower, and rocket launchers, among others. Although much of the game is spent in battle, the player has the ability to jump, hang from ledges, swim, and fly using jet packs, when needed. In combat, the player is free to set on a manual aiming system with the targeting camera fixed behind the character&#x27;s head. When using this technique, a crosshair appears on screen and the player character becomes translucent so that players can aim and shoot with finesse. By contrast, when walking around, the game plays similar to a 3D platformer.

In the game&#x27;s single-player mode, the player must explore a galaxy that is composed of 15 nonlinear worlds. Each world is composed of a series of stages with areas interconnected by different types of doors. Most doors open automatically, but some require a special action to be unlocked. For example, some doors require the player to defeat all the enemies in the area, while others may require a specific key. Although the player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies, health-recovery gems and ammunition crates can be collected throughout the world to increase the player&#x27;s resources. Power-ups can be found to expand the player&#x27;s health and ammunition capacity.

While progressing, the player can take control of three different characters: Juno, Vela, and Lupus. Each character has a special ability that allows them to uncover areas which the other characters cannot reach. Juno can walk through magma safely, Vela can swim underwater indefinitely, and Lupus can hover for a short period of time. Therefore, choosing the right character for the right stage is critical in order to complete the game. Initially, the game forces the player to use the three characters individually until they reach a meeting point. Once they reach the meeting point, all of the worlds can be tackled with any character in any order. The overall objective of the game is to explore all the galaxy to collect several starship parts and save a large number of Tribal survivors. Tribals can potentially be killed by weaponsfire, requiring the player to restart the encounter in order to save them. The player must collect all 12 ship parts and 282 Tribals to access the final stage.

In addition to the single-player mode, &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; features a multiplayer mode where two to four players can compete in traditional deathmatch games. Options such as the weapons available, the winning condition, and time limit can be changed to match player preference. Some multiplayer aspects, such as levels and characters, must be unlocked by finding the corresponding secret in the game&#x27;s single-player mode. Players can unlock racing mini-games that are played from an overhead perspective, as well as a firing range challenge, where players must shoot numerous targets while the game automatically follows a predefined path. &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; features a no split-screen co-operative mode where a second player may take control of Floyd, a floating robot that automatically follows the main player character in the single-player mode.

==Plot==
&quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; revolves around the galactic law enforcement team Jet Force Gemini, composed of twin siblings Juno and Vela and their wardog mascot Lupus. The game begins with the three characters in orbit around the planet Goldwood after barely escaping the destruction of the entire Jet Force fleet at the hands of the insectoid Mizar, who has been capturing and enslaving the native Tribals on Goldwood. When their ship is boarded by several of Mizar&#x27;s drones, the three decide to abandon their ship and go off on their own separate paths to stop the invasion. Along the way, Juno finds and reconstructs Floyd, a small floating robot who defects from Mizar and agrees to aid the team. After traversing various planets, the heroes find themselves reunited at Mizar&#x27;s Palace and confront Mizar, who escapes to a nearby asteroid and sets course to impact with Earth. To help the heroes, the Tribals&#x27; leader King Jeff provides them with an ancient starship that can quickly catch up to Mizar&#x27;s asteroid, asking them to rescue all the Tribals throughout the galaxy in exchange.

After rescuing all the Tribals and restoring the starship with several needed parts, the team, along with King Jeff, departs to the asteroid and battle Mizar. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, Mizar is revealed to be a robot controlled by King Jeff&#x27;s jealous brother, Barry, who apologizes for letting things get out of hand. With time running out until the asteroid strikes Earth, Floyd offers to carry a warhead into the asteroid&#x27;s core and destroy it. The team hesitantly agrees and flees in the starship shortly before Floyd sacrifices himself to destroy the asteroid. On Earth, the Jet Force Gemini team is given the highest honors for their accomplishments.

==Development==
&quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; was developed by Rare&#x27;s &quot;Blast Corps&quot; team. Work on the game began in 1997 with lead engineer Paul Mountain, who had previously worked on &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;. The inspirations of the game ranged from 80s arcade classics to more recent titles of the time. The free-roaming nature of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; influenced the scale and the openness of some of the backgrounds and settings, while the collecting and upgrading of weapons were inspired by &quot;Super Metroid&quot;. Mountain revealed that &quot;the behaviour of the bad guys was a mixture of arcade space shooter formations and &quot;Quake&quot;-style &#x27;attack and cover&#x27; mechanics&quot;. According to him, &quot;I suppose, in short, we were inspired by all the good stuff we&#x27;d played and enjoyed playing.&quot; &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; borrowed elements from non-video game sources. Lead artist Lee Musgrave admitted, &quot;There are elements of &quot;Star Wars&quot; in there, &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot;, &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot;, even &quot;Stargate&quot; – it was a real mix of everything and anything &#x27;space&#x27; related.&quot;

Most of the characters in the game were named after stars and constellations, such as Mizar and Vela. Originally, the protagonists Juno and Vela were designed as younger and more cartoon-like with large heads, but they were ultimately changed to a more mature version because Nintendo expressed concerns over a game starring two children killing a large number of creatures. The game&#x27;s controls were one of the main concerns during development. The idea was to retain a character-based game, where players could see the character they were playing while keeping the tightness and accuracy of first-person shooters. Rare initially attempted to automate the change of view and targeting mode based on the context of the action, but this idea was eventually replaced with a manual system. According to Mountain, &quot;The solution we ended with is a beautiful thing. It feels very old-school to me; difficult, unforgiving, but ultimately precise.&quot;

Because several members of the team enjoyed racing games and had worked on &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, they decided to include the futuristic Ant racing mini-game in the campaign mode and the top-down arcade racing games in the multiplayer mode. Developers initially considered the possibility to use the 4MB Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, but the idea was eventually dropped. According to Mountain, &quot;we wanted to deliver the same experience to all players and were confident that we could do this using the standard 4MB of RAM on the console.&quot; This led to some confusion as the box cover for the original release stated that it did support such a feature. Nintendo provided a quick-fix to the mislabeled covers by providing stickers declaring its Rumble Pak compatibility and fixed later printings of the boxes.

In May 1999, a playable demonstration of the game was presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California. A more complete version of the game was showcased at Nintendo Spaceworld in Japan in August 1999, alongside Rare&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. The game was originally intended to be released in North America on August 31, 1999, but was pushed back to September 27, 1999, to give the developers more time to polish up the game. It was then pushed back even further to October 11, 1999, due to manufacturing delays. In Europe, the game was released on October 29, 1999, and on December 1, 1999, in Japan. The Japanese release of &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; was localized as because Nintendo felt that the Japanese pronunciation of the Western title, &quot;Jetto Fōsu Jeminai&quot;, was too difficult to pronounce. Although 4Kids Entertainment obtained the rights to merchandising &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; toys, movies, and other recreational products, the company did not produce any merchandise.

==Reception==
&quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. &quot;Edge&quot; described it as &quot;a straightforward blaster at heart&quot;, while AllGame claimed that it &quot;pays homage to 8- and 16-bit games with its emphasis on high-intensity action and level design that requires skill with the controller.&quot; Writing for &quot;IGN&quot;, journalist Matt Casamassina remarked that, although &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; has some flaws and could be more polished, it is &quot;still one of Nintendo 64&#x27;s most original games and it has much more good going for it than it does bad.&quot; In a mixed review, &quot;Next Generation&quot; felt that the game was bloated with too many features and that it may exhaust players before it is over, concluding that the game would have been &quot;twice as good&quot; if &quot;Rare had cut all the tedious parts&quot;.

The game&#x27;s graphics and surround sound effects were received very positively. Casamassina described its sound effects as &quot;dead-on and crystal clear&quot; and its soundtrack as &quot;some of the very best ever put into a Nintendo 64 game&quot;, while &quot;GameRevolution&quot; said that the game &quot;goes for a more operatic feel than the generic video game techno.&quot; Graphically, the game was highlighted for its &quot;visually stunning&quot; settings, &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; animations, and special lighting, with &quot;Game Informer&quot; remarking that the game&#x27;s &quot;enormous&quot; explosions help intensify the action. Despite the praise, some critics observed occasional frame rate drops when the action increases or when the game is played in non-widescreen mode. &quot;Edge&quot; also criticized the camera for refusing to move in some situations, requiring players to enter the aiming mode to manually center it behind the player character.

Although &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; was generally praised for its challenging artificial intelligence, included mini-games and length, some critics reacted negatively to the game&#x27;s insistence on having to save every Tribal to fully complete the campaign mode. Casamassina felt that this task was &quot;far too tedious to truly be enjoyed.&quot; In contrast, &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; stated that revisiting previous stages with new weapons was fun and extends the game&#x27;s lifespan. Critics agreed its controls were complex and confusing and that they were clunky during multiplayer. In a negative review, &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; explained that the game is frustrating because players are required to constantly change from using the analog stick to the C buttons of the Nintendo 64 controller when switching to combat mode. &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that the controls remain responsive at all times, but acknowledged that the alternation between the two control styles may frustrate some players.

In a retrospective review, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; stated that &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; is &quot;a really enjoyable game&quot; with &quot;its fair share of flaws that tend to hinder the experience a little too much. That being said, it&#x27;s certainly an incredibly fun title, at its best, that will definitely raise a few smiles.&quot;

==Legacy==
After the release of &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot;, work on a Game Boy Color version of the game started, but the project was ultimately cancelled. According to former Rare designer and producer Martin Wakeley, &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; on the Game Boy Color &quot;was the only occasion I can remember Rare outsourcing anything. It was being done by Bits Studios and was nearly done last time I saw it, I&#x27;m not sure what happened to it.&quot; The game would be a shooter played from an isometric perspective and would follow Juno and Lupus searching for Vela after a signal is broadcast from an unknown planet. The game was never officially announced by either Rare or Nintendo.

In 2000, &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; was ranked by IGN at number 20 in their list of The Top 25 N64 Games of All Time. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked it the 93rd best game available on Nintendo platforms. The staff called it Rare&#x27;s &quot;big hope&quot; due to the highly anticipated but delayed Nintendo 64 game &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. Subsequent games developed by Rare have featured cameo appearances of &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot;, including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise&quot;, and &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;. Players may also dress their character up as Juno, Vela, and Lupus in &quot;&quot; through the use of a downloadable content pack. The game is included as part of the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; video game compilation for Xbox One, with support for dual-analog controls being added post-release. The game was also re-released via the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on November 30, 2023 in Japan, and on December 7, 2023 in western regions.

<text>Surface modification is the act of modifying the surface of a material by bringing physical, chemical or biological characteristics different from the ones originally found on the surface of a material.
This modification is usually made to solid materials, but it is possible to find examples of the modification to the surface of specific liquids.

The modification can be done by different methods with a view to altering a wide range of characteristics of the surface, such as: roughness, hydrophilicity, surface charge, surface energy, biocompatibility and reactivity.

== Surface engineering ==
Surface engineering is the sub-discipline of materials science which deals with the surface of solid matter. It has applications to chemistry, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering (particularly in relation to semiconductor manufacturing).

Solids are composed of a bulk material covered by a surface. The surface which bounds the bulk material is called the Surface phase. It acts as an interface to the surrounding environment. The bulk material in a solid is called the Bulk phase.

The surface phase of a solid interacts with the surrounding environment. This interaction can degrade the surface phase over time. Environmental degradation of the surface phase over time can be caused by wear, corrosion, fatigue and creep.

Surface engineering involves altering the properties of the Surface Phase in order to reduce the degradation over time. This is accomplished by making the surface robust to the environment in which it will be used.

===Applications and Future of Surface Engineering===
Surface engineering techniques are being used in the automotive, aerospace, missile, power, electronic, biomedical, textile, petroleum, petrochemical, chemical, steel, power, cement, machine tools, construction industries. Surface engineering techniques can be used to develop a wide range of functional properties, including physical, chemical, electrical, electronic, magnetic, mechanical, wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant properties at the required substrate surfaces. Almost all types of materials, including metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites can be coated on similar or dissimilar materials. It is also possible to form coatings of newer materials (e.g., met glass. beta-C3N4), graded deposits, multi-component deposits etc.

In 1995, surface engineering was a £10 billion market in the United Kingdom. Coatings, to make surface life robust from wear and corrosion, was approximately half the market.

Functionalization of Antimicrobial Surfaces is a unique technology that can be used for sterilization in health industry, self-cleaning surfaces and protection from bio films.

In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in surface engineering from age-old electroplating to processes such as vapor phase deposition, diffusion, thermal spray &amp; welding using advanced heat sources like plasma, laser, ion, electron, microwave, solar beams, synchrotron radiation, pulsed arc, pulsed combustion, spark, friction and induction.

It&#x27;s estimated that loss due to wear and corrosion in the US is approximately $500 billion. In the US, there are around 9524 establishments (including automotive, aircraft, power and construction industries) who depend on engineered surfaces with support from 23,466 industries.

== Surface functionalization ==

Surface functionalization introduces chemical functional groups to a surface. This way, materials with functional groups on their surfaces can be designed from substrates with standard bulk material properties. Prominent examples can be found in semiconductor industry and biomaterial research.

=== Polymer Surface Functionalization ===
Plasma processing technologies are successfully employed for polymers surface functionalization.

<text>The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is a digital library portal for researchers on astronomy and physics, operated for NASA by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. ADS maintains three bibliographic collections containing over 15 million records, including all arXiv e-prints. Abstracts and full-text of major astronomy and physics publications are indexed and searchable through the portal.

==Historical context==
Johann Friedrich Weidler published the first comprehensive history of astronomy in 1741 and the first astronomical bibliography in 1755. This was an effort to archive and classify earlier astronomical knowledge and works.

This effort was continued by Jérôme de La Lande who published his &quot;Bibliographie astronomique&quot; in 1803, a work that covered the period from 480 BCE to the year of publication.

The &quot;Bibliographie générale de l’astronomie, Volume I and Volume II&quot;, published by J.C. Houzeau and A. Lancaster, followed in 1882 until 1889.

As the number of astronomers and astronomical publications grew, bibliographical efforts became institutional tasks, first at the Observatoire Royal de Belgique, where the &quot;Bibliography of Astronomy&quot; was published from 1881 to 1898, and then at the Astronomischer Rechen-Institut in Heidelberg, where the yearly &quot;Astronomischer Jahresbericht&quot; was published from 1899 to 1968. After 1968, this was replaced by the yearly &quot;Astronomy and Astrophysics Abstracts&quot; book series, which continued until the end of the 20th century.

== History ==
The first suggestion of a digital database of journal paper abstracts was made at a conference on &quot;Astronomy from Large Data-Bases&quot; held in Garching bei München in 1987. 

An initial version of ADS, with a database consisting of 40 papers, was created as a proof of concept in 1988. The ADS Abstract Service became available for general use via proprietary network software in April 1993, and it was connected to SIMBAD a few months later. In early 1994 the ADS web-based service was launched, which effectively quadrupled the number of active users in the five weeks following its introduction. 

In 2011 the ADS launched ADS Labs Streamlined Search which introduced facets for query refinement and selection. In 2013, ADS Labs 2.0 started featuring a new search engine, full-text search functionality, scalable facets, and an API was introduced. In 2015, the new ADS, code-named Bumblebee, was released as ADS-beta. The ADS-beta system features a micro-services API and client-side dynamic page loading served on a cloud platform. In May 2018 the beta label was dropped and Bumblebee became the default ADS interface—with some legacy features (ADS Classic) remaining available. Development continues to the present day, with an extensible API available: enabling users to build their own utilities on top of the ADS bibliographic record.

The ADS service is distributed worldwide with twelve mirror sites in twelve countries and with the database synchronized by weekly updates using rsync, a mirroring utility which allows updates to only the portions of the database which have changed. All updates are triggered centrally, but they initiate scripts at the mirror sites which &quot;pull&quot; updated data from the main ADS servers.

==Data in the system==
At first, the journal articles available via ADS were exclusively scanned bitmaps created from the paper journals and the abstracts created using optical character recognition software. Some of these scanned articles up to around 1995 are available for free by agreement with the journal publishers, with some dating from as far back as the early 19th century. Eventually, because of a wider spread of online editions of journal publications, abstracts would start to instead be loaded into ADS directly.

Papers are indexed within the database by their bibliographic record which contains the details of the journal they were published in, and various associated metadata, such as author lists, references and citations. Originally this data was stored in ASCII format but eventually the limitations of this encouraged the database maintainers to migrate all records to an XML (Extensible Markup Language) format in 2000. Bibliographic records are now stored as an XML element with sub-elements for the various metadata.

Scanned articles are stored in TIFF format at both medium and high resolution. The TIFF files are converted on demand into GIF files, for on-screen viewing, and PDF or PostScript files for printing. The generated files are then cached to eliminate needlessly frequent regenerations for popular articles. As of 2000, ADS contained 250 GB of scans, which consisted of 1,128,955 article pages comprising 138,789 articles. By 2005 this had grown to 650 GB and was expected to grow further to about 900 GB by 2007. No further information has been published (2005).

The database initially contained only astronomical references, but has now grown to incorporate three databases, covering astronomy
references (including planetary sciences and solar physics), physics references (including instrumentation and geosciences), as well as preprints of scientific papers from arXiv. The astronomy database is by far the most advanced and its use accounts for about 85% of the total ADS usage. Articles are assigned to the different databases according to the subject rather than the journal they are published in, so that articles from any one journal might appear in all three subject databases. The separation of the databases allows searching in each discipline to be tailored, so that words can automatically be given different weight functions in different database searches, depending on how common they are in the relevant field.

Data in the preprint archive is updated daily from arXiv which is the dominant repository of physics and astronomy preprints. The advent of preprint servers has, like ADS, had a significant impact on the rate of astronomical research, as papers are often made available from preprint servers weeks or months before they are published in the journals. The incorporation of preprints from arXiv into ADS means that the search engine can return the most current research available, with the caveat that preprints may not have been peer-reviewed or proofread to the required standard for publication in the main journals. The database of ADS links preprints with subsequently published articles wherever possible, so that citation and reference searches will return links to the journal article where the preprint was cited.

==Software and hardware==
The software runs on a system that was written specifically for the ADS, allowing for extensive customization for astronomical needs that would not have been possible with general purpose database software. The scripts are designed to be as platform independent as possible, given the need to facilitate mirroring on different systems around the world, although the growing use of Linux as the operating system of choice within astronomy has led to increasing optimization of the scripts for installation on that platform.

The main ADS server is located at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is a dual 64-bit X86 Intel server with two quad-core 3.0 GHz CPUs and 32 GB of RAM, running the CentOS 5.4 Linux distribution. As of 2022, there are mirrors located in China, Chile, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine.

==Indexing==
ADS currently (2005) receives abstracts or tables of contents from almost two hundred journal sources. The service may receive data referring to the same article from multiple sources, and creates one bibliographic reference based on the most accurate data from each source. The common use of TeX and LaTeX by almost all scientific journals greatly facilitates the incorporation of bibliographic data into the system in a standardized format, and importing HTML-coded web-based articles is also simple. ADS utilizes Python and Perl scripts for importing, processing and standardizing bibliographic data.

The apparently mundane task of converting author names into a standard &quot;Surname, Initial&quot; format is actually one of the more difficult to automate, due to the wide variety of naming conventions around the world and the possibility that a given name such as Davis could be a first name, middle name or surname. The accurate conversion of names requires a detailed knowledge of the names of authors active in astronomy, and ADS maintains an extensive database of author names, which is also used in searching the database (see below).

For electronic articles, a list of the references given at the end of the article is easily extracted. For scanned articles, reference extraction relies on OCR. The reference database can then be &quot;inverted&quot; to list the citations for each paper in the database. Citation lists have been used in the past to identify popular articles missing from the database; mostly these were from before 1975 and have now been added to the system.

==Coverage==
The database now contains over fifteen million articles. In the cases of the major journals of astronomy (&quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot;, &quot;Astronomical Journal&quot;, &quot;Astronomy and Astrophysics&quot;, &quot;Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific&quot; and the &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot;), coverage is complete, with all issues indexed from number 1 to the present. These journals account for about two-thirds of the papers in the database, with the rest consisting of papers published in over 100 other journals from around the world, as well as in conference proceedings.

While the database contains the complete contents of all the major journals and many minor ones as well, its coverage of references and citations is much less complete. References in and citations of articles in the major journals are fairly complete, but references such as &quot;private communication&quot;, &quot;in press&quot; or &quot;in preparation&quot; cannot be matched, and author errors in reference listings also introduce potential errors. Astronomical papers may cite and be cited by articles in journals which fall outside the scope of ADS, such as chemistry, mathematics or biology journals.

==Search engine==

Since its inception, the ADS has developed a highly complex search engine to query the abstract and object databases. The search engine is tailor-made for searching astronomical abstracts, and the engine and its user interface assume that the user is well-versed in astronomy and able to interpret search results which are designed to return more than just the most relevant papers. The database can be queried for author names, astronomical object names, title words, and words in the abstract text, and results can be filtered according to a number of criteria. It works by first gathering synonyms and simplifying search terms as described above, and then generating an &quot;inverted file&quot;, which is a list of all the documents matching each search term. The user-selected logic and filters are then applied to this inverted list to generate the final search results.

===Author name queries===
The system indexes author names by surname and initials, and accounts for the possible variations in spelling of names using a list of variations. This is common in the case of names including accents such as umlauts and transliterations from Arabic or Cyrillic script. An example of an entry in the author synonym list is:

:&quot;AFANASJEV, V&quot;
:&quot;AFANAS’EV, V&quot;
:&quot;AFANAS’IEV, V&quot;
:&quot;AFANASEV, V&quot;
:&quot;AFANASYEV, V&quot;
:&quot;AFANS’IEV, V&quot;
:&quot;AFANSEV, V&quot;

===Object name searches===
The capability to search for papers on specific astronomical objects is one of ADS&#x27;s most powerful tools. The system uses data from the SIMBAD, the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database, the International Astronomical Union Circulars and the Lunar and Planetary Institute to identify papers referring to a given object, and can also search by object position, listing papers which concern objects within a 10 arcminute radius of a given Right Ascension and Declination. These databases combine the many catalogue designations an object might have, so that a search for the Pleiades will also find papers which list the famous open cluster in Taurus under any of its other catalog designations or popular names, such as M45, the Seven Sisters or Melotte 22.

===Title and abstract searches===
The search engine first filters search terms in several ways. An M followed by a space or hyphen has the space or hyphen removed, so that searching for Messier catalogue objects is simplified and a user input of M45, M 45 or M-45 all result in the same query being executed; similarly, NGC designations and common search terms such as Shoemaker Levy and T Tauri are stripped of spaces. Unimportant words such as AT, OR and TO are stripped out, although in some cases case sensitivity is maintained, so that while and is ignored, And is converted to &quot;Andromeda&quot;, and Her is converted to &quot;Hercules&quot;, but her is ignored.

===Synonym replacement===
Once search terms have been preprocessed, the database is queried with the revised search term, as well as synonyms for it. As well as simple synonym replacement such as searching for both plural and singular forms, ADS also searches for a large number of specifically astronomical synonyms. For example, spectrograph and spectroscope have basically the same meaning, and in an astronomical context metallicity and abundance are also synonymous. ADS&#x27;s synonym list was created manually, by grouping the list of words in the database according to similar meanings.

As well as English language synonyms, ADS also searches for English translations of foreign search terms and vice versa, so that a search for the French word &quot;soleil&quot; retrieves references to Sun, and papers in languages other than English can be returned by English search terms.

Synonym replacement can be disabled if required, so that a rare term which is a synonym of a much more common term (such as &#x27;dateline&#x27; rather than &#x27;date&#x27;) can be searched for specifically.

===Selection logic===
The search engine allows selection logic both within fields and between fields. Search terms in each field can be combined with OR, AND, simple logic or Boolean logic, and the user can specify which fields must be matched in the search results. This allows complex searches to be built; for example, the user could search for papers concerning NGC 6543 OR NGC 7009, with the paper titles containing (radius OR velocity) AND NOT (abundance OR temperature).

===Result filtering===
Search results can be filtered according to a number of criteria, including specifying a range of years such as &quot;1945 to 1975&quot;, &quot;2000 to the present day&quot; or &quot;before 1900&quot;, and what type of journal the article appears in [–] non-peer-reviewed articles such as conference proceedings. These can be excluded or specifically searched for, or specific journals can be included in or excluded from the search.

==Search results==

Although it was conceived as a means of accessing abstracts and papers, ADS provides a substantial amount of ancillary information along with search results. For each abstract returned, links are provided to other papers in the database which are referenced, and which cite the paper, and a link is provided to a preprint, where one exists. The system also generates a link to &quot;also-read&quot; articles – that is, those which have been most commonly accessed by those reading the article. In this way, an ADS user can determine which papers are of most interest to astronomers who are interested in the subject of a given paper.

Also returned are links to the SIMBAD and/or NASA Extragalactic Database object name databases, via which a user can quickly find out basic observational data about the objects analyzed in a paper, and find further papers on those objects.

==Impact on astronomy==
ADS is almost universally used as a research tool among astronomers, and there are several studies that have estimated quantitatively how much more efficient ADS has made astronomy; one estimated that ADS increased the efficiency of astronomical research by 333 full-time equivalent research years per year, and another found that in 2002 its effect was equivalent to 736 full-time researchers, or all the astronomical research done in France. ADS has allowed literature searches that would previously have taken days or weeks to carry out to be completed in seconds, and it is estimated that ADS has increased the readership and use of the astronomical literature by a factor of about three since its inception.

In monetary terms, this increase in efficiency represents a considerable amount. There are about 12,000 active astronomical researchers worldwide, so ADS is the equivalent of about 5% of the working population of astronomers. The global astronomical research budget is estimated at between 4,000 and US$5,000 million, so the value of ADS to astronomy would be about 200–250 million USD annually. Its operating budget is a small fraction of this amount.

The great importance of ADS to astronomers has been recognized by the United Nations, the General Assembly of which has commended ADS on its work and success, particularly noting its importance to astronomers in the developing world, in reports of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. A 2002 report by a visiting committee to the Center for Astrophysics, meanwhile, said that the service had &quot;revolutionized the use of the astronomical literature&quot;, and was &quot;probably the most valuable single contribution to astronomy research that the CfA has made in its lifetime&quot;.

==Sociological studies using ADS==
Because it is used almost universally by astronomers, ADS can reveal much about how astronomical research is distributed around the world. Most users access the system from institutes of higher education, whose IP address can easily be used to determine the user&#x27;s geographical location. Studies reveal that the highest per-capita users of ADS are France and Netherlands-based astronomers, and while more developed countries (measured by GDP per capita) use the system more than less developed countries; the relationship between GDP per capita and ADS use is not linear. The range of ADS usage per capita far exceeds the range of GDP per capita, and basic research carried out in a country, as measured by ADS usage, has been found to be proportional to the square of the country&#x27;s GDP divided by its population. Statistics also imply that there are about three times as many astronomers in countries of European culture as in countries of Asian cultures, perhaps suggesting cultural differences in the importance attached to astronomical research. The amount of basic research carried out in a country is found to be proportional to the number of astronomers in that country multiplied by its GDP per capita, with considerable scatter.

ADS has also been used to show that the fraction of single-author astronomy papers has decreased substantially since 1975 and that astronomical papers with more than 50 authors have become more common since 1990.

<text>A sous-chef is a chef who is second in command of a kitchen, ranking directly below the head chef. In large kitchens, sous-chefs generally manage members of the kitchen on behalf of the head chef, who is usually preoccupied with other tasks.

==Duties and functions==
The sous-chef has many responsibilities, because the executive chef has a more overarching role. Sous-chefs must plan and direct how the food is presented on the plate, keep their kitchen staff in order, train new chefs, create the work schedule, and make sure all the food that goes to customers is of the best quality to maintain high standards.

Sous-chefs are in charge of making sure all kitchen equipment is in working order. They must thoroughly understand how to use and troubleshoot all appliances and cooking instruments in the event of a malfunctioning cooking device. Sous-chefs are in charge of disciplining any kitchen staff who may have acted against restaurant policy. Incentive programs are commonly used among sous-chefs to encourage their staff to abide by rules and regulations, and motivate them to work efficiently at all times. Under the oversight of the sous-chef, downtime should be used for prepping, cleaning and other kitchen duties. They are responsible for inventory, product and supply rotation, and menu tasting. Sous-chefs need to be responsive and have the ability to improvise when a problem arises while the restaurant is busy. They must also ensure safety precautions and sanitary provisions are taken to ensure a safe and clean working environment.

==Qualifications==
Many sous-chefs get to their position via promotion, after training and experience in the culinary profession.

In Canada, one way to advance to the sous-chef position is by getting a specialized college diploma, acquiring the knowledge necessary to qualify to take the Red Seal for the Journeyman Cook exam. A year after completing the exam, it is possible to enroll in the Chef Program to take an exam with the Canadian Culinary Foundation. Then, after four to five years of working experience, one can apply to the Certified Chef de Cuisine program.

<text>, provisional designation , and also known by the temporary name AL00667, is a sub-kilometer asteroid, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group, approximately 300 meters in diameter.

It was discovered on 13 January 2004, by astronomers of the LINEAR program at the Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States.

== Description ==

Based on the asteroids brightness and assumed proximity to Earth, the asteroid was originally estimated to be only 30 meters in diameter.

=== Orbit and classification ===

 orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.88–1.26 AU once every 13 months (405 days; semi-major axis of 1.07 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 17° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Socorro in January 2004.

=== Close approaches ===

Although rather ordinary, it caused some controversy in astronomical circles due to initial projections posted on the web by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) suggesting an imminent collision with Earth on or about January 15 with a likelihood of 1:4. These projections came from very early observations, and turned out to be inaccurate (which is an ordinary occurrence in astronomy, as new observations refine the projected path of an object). In fact, the poster at the MPC had not realised that the data he had posted was essentially an impact prediction.

The asteroid passed Earth on 16 February 2004 at a distance of (or 33 times the distance from Earth to the Moon), posing no threat. It is an Apollo asteroid, with perihelion at 0.88 AU, a rather low eccentricity of 0.17, an inclination of 17° and an orbital period of 1.11 years.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, measures between 240 and 480 meters in diameter, for a measured absolute magnitude of 20.5, and an assumed albedo of 0.20 and 0.05, which corresponds to a body with a stony and carbonaceous composition, respectively.

<text>4G refers to the fourth-generation of cellular network technology, first introduced in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Compared to preceding third-generation (3G) technologies, 4G has been designed to support all-IP communications and broadband services, and eliminates circuit switching in voice telephony. It also has considerably higher data bandwidth compared to 3G, enabling a variety of data-intensive applications such as high-definition media streaming and the expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

The earliest deployed technologies marketed as &quot;4G&quot; were Long Term Evolution (LTE), developed by the 3GPP group, and Mobile Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (Mobile WiMAX), based on IEEE specifications. These provided significant enhancements over previous 3G and 2G standards such as UMTS, CDMA2000, HSPA and EDGE. However, it had been debated whether these should be considered 4G; in 2008, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) defined characteristics and specifications of 4G, including speed requirements, as IMT Advanced. LTE Advanced (LTE-A) and Mobile WiMAX 2 were developed as enhanced technologies that were compliant with IMT Advanced and hence called &quot;true&quot; 4G, whereas their predecessors have been referred to as 3.9G/3.95G. 4G is not backward compatible with 3G due to significant differences in network architecture and technological advancements.

4G has enabled the widespread adoption of cloud computing, fixed wireless access, and real-time data exchange for the Internet of Things (IoT), facilitating the growth of connected devices and smart systems. 4G has also significantly expanded the availability of mobile TV, with numerous dedicated applications and services making it widely accessible to users. The improved network capacity and lower latency also support high-speed, low-latency applications, enhancing user experience in activities such as online gaming and live broadcasts. 4G technology accounted for 60 percent of all mobile connections worldwide. It was eventually succeeded by 5G, which introduced even faster speeds, lower latency, and the ability to support advanced use cases across various industries.

== Technical overview ==
In November 2008, the International Telecommunication Union-Radio communications sector (ITU-R) specified a set of requirements for 4G standards, named the International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced (IMT-Advanced) specification, setting peak speed requirements for 4G service at 100 megabits per second (Mbit/s)(=12.5 megabytes per second) for high mobility communication (such as from trains and cars) and 1 gigabit per second (Gbit/s) for low mobility communication (such as pedestrians and stationary users).

Since the first-release versions of Mobile WiMAX and LTE support much less than 1 Gbit/s peak bit rate, they are not fully IMT-Advanced compliant, but are often branded 4G by service providers. According to operators, a generation of the network refers to the deployment of a new non-backward-compatible technology. On December 6, 2010, ITU-R recognized that these two technologies, as well as other beyond-3G technologies that do not fulfill the IMT-Advanced requirements, could nevertheless be considered &quot;4G&quot;, provided they represent forerunners to IMT-Advanced compliant versions and &quot;a substantial level of improvement in performance and capabilities with respect to the initial third generation systems now deployed&quot;. Both the original LTE and WiMAX standards had previously sometimes been referred to as 3.9G/3.95G. The ITU&#x27;s new definition for 4G also included Evolved High Speed Packet Access (HSPA+). 

Mobile WiMAX Release 2 (also known as &quot;WirelessMAN-Advanced&quot; or &quot;IEEE 802.16m&quot;) and LTE Advanced
(LTE-A) are IMT-Advanced compliant backwards compatible versions of the above two systems, standardized during the spring 2011, and promising speeds in the order of 1 Gbit/s. In January 2012, the ITU backtracked on its previous definition for 4G, claiming that Mobile WiMAX 2 and LTE Advanced are &quot;true 4G&quot; while their predecessors are &quot;transitional&quot; 3G-4G.

As opposed to earlier generations, a 4G system does not support traditional circuit-switched telephony service, but instead relies on all-Internet Protocol (IP) based communication such as IP telephony. As seen below, the spread spectrum radio technology used in 3G systems is abandoned in all 4G candidate systems and replaced by OFDMA multi-carrier transmission and other frequency-domain equalization (FDE) schemes, making it possible to transfer very high bit rates despite extensive multi-path radio propagation (echoes). The peak bit rate is further improved by smart antenna arrays for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications.

== Background ==
In the field of mobile communications, a &quot;generation&quot; generally refers to a change in the fundamental nature of the service, non-backwards-compatible transmission technology, higher peak bit rates, new frequency bands, wider channel frequency bandwidth in Hertz, and higher capacity for many simultaneous data transfers (higher system spectral efficiency in bit/second/Hertz/site).

New mobile generations have appeared about every ten years since the first move from 1981 analog (1G) to digital (2G) transmission in 1992. This was followed, in 2001, by 3G multi-media support, spread spectrum transmission and a minimum peak bit rate of 200 kbit/s, in 2011/2012 to be followed by &quot;real&quot; 4G, which refers to all-IP packet-switched networks giving mobile ultra-broadband (gigabit speed) access.

While the ITU has adopted recommendations for technologies that would be used for future global communications, they do not actually perform the standardization or development work themselves, instead relying on the work of other standard bodies such as IEEE, WiMAX Forum, and 3GPP.

In the mid-1990s, the ITU-R standardization organization released the IMT-2000 requirements as a framework for what standards should be considered 3G systems, requiring 2000 kbit/s peak bit rate. The fastest 3G-based standard in the UMTS family is the HSPA+ standard, which has been commercially available since 2009 and offers 21 Mbit/s downstream (11 Mbit/s upstream) without MIMO, i.e. with only one antenna, and in 2011 accelerated up to 42 Mbit/s peak bit rate downstream using either DC-HSPA+ (simultaneous use of two 5 MHz UMTS carriers) or
2x2 MIMO. In theory speeds up to 672 Mbit/s are possible, but have not been deployed yet. The fastest 3G-based standard in the CDMA2000 family is the EV-DO Rev. B, which is available since 2010 and offers 15.67 Mbit/s downstream.

In 2008, ITU-R specified the IMT Advanced (International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced) requirements for 4G systems.

== Frequencies for 4G+ LTE networks ==
&quot;See here: LTE frequency bands&quot;

== IMT-Advanced requirements ==
This article refers to 4G using IMT-Advanced (&quot;International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced&quot;), as defined by ITU-R. An IMT-Advanced cellular system must fulfill the following requirements:
* Be based on an all-IP packet switched network.
* Have peak data rates of up to approximately 100Mbit/s for high mobility such as mobile access and up to approximately 1Gbit/s for low mobility such as nomadic/local wireless access.
* Be able to dynamically share and use the network resources to support more simultaneous users per cell.
* Use scalable channel bandwidths of 5–20 MHz, optionally up to 40 MHz.
* Have peak link spectral efficiency of 15bit/s·Hz in the downlink, and 6.75bit/s·Hz in the up link (meaning that 1Gbit/s in the downlink should be possible over less than 67 MHz bandwidth).
* System spectral efficiency is, in indoor cases, 3bit/s·Hz·cell for downlink and 2.25bit/s·Hz·cell for up link.
* Smooth handovers across heterogeneous networks.

In September 2009, the technology proposals were submitted to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as 4G candidates. Basically all proposals are based on two technologies:

* LTE Advanced standardized by the 3GPP
* 802.16m standardized by the IEEE

Implementations of Mobile WiMAX and first-release LTE were largely considered a stopgap solution that would offer a considerable boost until WiMAX 2 (based on the 802.16m specification) and LTE Advanced was deployed. The latter&#x27;s standard versions were ratified in spring 2011.

The first set of 3GPP requirements on LTE Advanced was approved in June 2008. LTE Advanced was standardized in 2010 as part of Release 10 of the 3GPP specification.

Some sources consider first-release LTE and Mobile WiMAX implementations as pre-4G or near-4G, as they do not fully comply with the planned requirements of 1Gbit/s for stationary reception and 100Mbit/s for mobile.

Confusion has been caused by some mobile carriers who have launched products advertised as 4G but which according to some sources are pre-4G versions, commonly referred to as 3.9G, which do not follow the ITU-R defined principles for 4G standards, but today can be called 4G according to ITU-R. Vodafone Netherlands for example, advertised LTE as 4G, while advertising LTE Advanced as their &#x27;4G+&#x27; service. A common argument for branding 3.9G systems as new-generation is that they use different frequency bands from 3G technologies; that they are based on a new radio-interface paradigm; and that the standards are not backwards compatible with 3G, whilst some of the standards are forwards compatible with IMT-2000 compliant versions of the same standards.

== System standards ==

=== IMT-2000 compliant 4G standards ===
As of October 2010, ITU-R Working Party 5D approved two industry-developed technologies (LTE Advanced and WirelessMAN-Advanced) for inclusion in the ITU&#x27;s International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced program (IMT-Advanced program), which is focused on global communication systems that will be available several years from now.

==== LTE Advanced ====

LTE Advanced (Long Term Evolution Advanced) is a candidate for IMT-Advanced standard, formally submitted by the 3GPP organization to ITU-T in the fall 2009, and as of 2013 has been released to the public.The target of 3GPP LTE Advanced is to reach and surpass the ITU requirements. LTE Advanced is essentially an enhancement to LTE. It is not a new technology, but rather an improvement on the existing LTE network. This upgrade path makes it more cost effective for vendors to offer LTE and then upgrade to LTE Advanced which is similar to the upgrade from WCDMA to HSPA. LTE and LTE Advanced will also make use of additional spectrums and multiplexing to allow it to achieve higher data speeds. Coordinated Multi-point Transmission will also allow more system capacity to help handle the enhanced data speeds.
==== IEEE 802.16m or WirelessMAN-Advanced ====
The IEEE 802.16m or WirelessMAN-Advanced (WiMAX 2) evolution of 802.16e is under development, with the objective to fulfill the IMT-Advanced criteria of 1 Gbit/s for stationary reception and 100 Mbit/s for mobile reception.

=== Forerunner versions ===

==== Long Term Evolution (LTE) ====


The pre-4G 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology is often branded &quot;4G – LTE&quot;, but the first LTE release does not fully comply with the IMT-Advanced requirements. LTE has a theoretical net bit rate capacity of up to 100 Mbit/s in the downlink and 50 Mbit/s in the uplink if a 20 MHz channel is used — and more if multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), i.e. antenna arrays, are used.

The physical radio interface was at an early stage named &quot;High Speed OFDM Packet Access&quot; (HSOPA), now named Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA).
The first LTE USB dongles do not support any other radio interface.

The world&#x27;s first publicly available LTE service was opened in the two Scandinavian capitals, Stockholm (Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks systems) and Oslo (a Huawei system) on December 14, 2009, and branded 4G. The user terminals were manufactured by Samsung. As of November 2012, the five publicly available LTE services in the United States are provided by MetroPCS, Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T Mobility, U.S. Cellular, Sprint, and T-Mobile US.

T-Mobile Hungary launched a public beta test (called &quot;friendly user test&quot;) on 7 October 2011, and has offered commercial 4G LTE services since 1 January 2012.

In South Korea, SK Telecom and LG U+ have enabled access to LTE service since 1 July 2011 for data devices, slated to go nationwide by 2012. KT Telecom closed its 2G service by March 2012 and completed nationwide LTE service in the same frequency around 1.8 GHz by June 2012.

In the United Kingdom, LTE services were launched by EE in October 2012, by O2 and Vodafone in August 2013, and by Three in December 2013.

==== Mobile WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e) ====
The Mobile WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e-2005) mobile wireless broadband access (MWBA) standard (also known as WiBro in South Korea) is sometimes branded 4G, and offers peak data rates of 128 Mbit/s downlink and 56 Mbit/s uplink over 20 MHz wide channels. 

In June 2006, the world&#x27;s first commercial mobile WiMAX service was opened by KT in Seoul, South Korea.

Sprint has begun using Mobile WiMAX, as of 29 September 2008, branding it as a &quot;4G&quot; network even though the current version does not fulfill the IMT Advanced requirements on 4G systems.

In Russia, Belarus and Nicaragua WiMax broadband internet access were offered by a Russian company Scartel, and was also branded 4G, Yota.
In the latest version of the standard, WiMax 2.1, the standard has been updated to be not compatible with earlier WiMax standard, and is instead interchangeable with LTE-TDD system, effectively merging WiMax standard with LTE.

==== TD-LTE for China market ====
Just as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and WiMAX are being vigorously promoted in the global telecommunications industry, the former (LTE) is also the most powerful 4G mobile communications leading technology and has quickly occupied the Chinese market. TD-LTE, one of the two variants of the LTE air interface technologies, is not yet mature, but many domestic and international wireless carriers are, one after the other turning to TD-LTE.

IBM&#x27;s data shows that 67% of the operators are considering LTE because this is the main source of their future market. The above news also confirms IBM&#x27;s statement that while only 8% of the operators are considering the use of WiMAX, WiMAX can provide the fastest network transmission to its customers on the market and could challenge LTE.

TD-LTE is not the first 4G wireless mobile broadband network data standard, but it is China&#x27;s 4G standard that was amended and published by China&#x27;s largest telecom operator – China Mobile. After a series of field trials, is expected to be released into the commercial phase in the next two years. Ulf Ewaldsson, Ericsson&#x27;s vice president said: &quot;the Chinese Ministry of Industry and China Mobile in the fourth quarter of this year will hold a large-scale field test, by then, Ericsson will help the hand.&quot; But viewing from the current development trend, whether this standard advocated by China Mobile will be widely recognized by the international market is still debatable.

=== Discontinued candidate systems ===

==== UMB (formerly EV-DO Rev. C) ====
UMB (Ultra Mobile Broadband) was the brand name for a discontinued 4G project within the 3GPP2 standardization group to improve the CDMA2000 mobile phone standard for next generation applications and requirements. In November 2008, Qualcomm, UMB&#x27;s lead sponsor, announced it was ending development of the technology, favoring LTE instead. The objective was to achieve data speeds over 275 Mbit/s downstream and over 75 Mbit/s upstream.

==== Flash-OFDM ====
At an early stage the Flash-OFDM system was expected to be further developed into a 4G standard.

==== iBurst and MBWA (IEEE 802.20) systems ====
The iBurst system (or HC-SDMA, High Capacity Spatial Division Multiple Access) was at an early stage considered to be a 4G predecessor. It was later further developed into the Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) system, also known as IEEE 802.20.

== Principal technologies in all candidate systems ==
=== Key features ===
The following key features can be observed in all suggested 4G technologies:
* Physical layer transmission techniques are as follows:
** MIMO: To attain ultra high spectral efficiency by means of spatial processing including multi-antenna and multi-user MIMO
** Frequency-domain-equalization, for example &quot;multi-carrier modulation&quot; (OFDM) in the downlink or &quot;single-carrier frequency-domain-equalization&quot; (SC-FDE) in the uplink: To exploit the frequency selective channel property without complex equalization
** Frequency-domain statistical multiplexing, for example (OFDMA) or (single-carrier FDMA) (SC-FDMA, a.k.a. linearly precoded OFDMA, LP-OFDMA) in the uplink: Variable bit rate by assigning different sub-channels to different users based on the channel conditions.
** Turbo principle error-correcting codes: To minimize the required SNR at the reception side
* Channel-dependent scheduling: To use the time-varying channel
* Link adaptation: Adaptive modulation and error-correcting codes
* Mobile IP utilized for mobility
* IP-based femtocells (home nodes connected to fixed Internet broadband infrastructure)

As opposed to earlier generations, 4G systems do not support circuit switched telephony. IEEE 802.20, UMB and OFDM standards lack soft-handover support, also known as cooperative relaying.

=== Multiplexing and access schemes ===

Recently, new access schemes like Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), Single Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), Interleaved FDMA, and Multi-carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) are gaining more importance for the next generation systems. These are based on efficient FFT algorithms and frequency domain equalization, resulting in a lower number of multiplications per second. They also make it possible to control the bandwidth and form the spectrum in a flexible way. However, they require advanced dynamic channel allocation and adaptive traffic scheduling.

WiMax is using OFDMA in the downlink and in the uplink. For the LTE (telecommunication), OFDMA is used for the downlink; by contrast, Single-carrier FDMA is used for the uplink since OFDMA contributes more to the PAPR related issues and results in nonlinear operation of amplifiers. IFDMA provides less power fluctuation and thus requires energy-inefficient linear amplifiers. Similarly, MC-CDMA is in the proposal for the IEEE 802.20 standard. These access schemes offer the same efficiencies as older technologies like CDMA. Apart from this, scalability and higher data rates can be achieved.

The other important advantage of the above-mentioned access techniques is that they require less complexity for equalization at the receiver. This is an added advantage especially in the MIMO environments since the spatial multiplexing transmission of MIMO systems inherently require high complexity equalization at the receiver.

In addition to improvements in these multiplexing systems, improved modulation techniques are being used. Whereas earlier standards largely used Phase-shift keying, more efficient systems such as 64QAM are being proposed for use with the 3GPP Long Term Evolution standards.

=== IPv6 support ===
Unlike 3G, which is based on two parallel infrastructures consisting of circuit switched and packet switched network nodes, 4G is based on packet switching &quot;only&quot;. This requires low-latency data transmission.

As IPv4 addresses are (nearly) exhausted, IPv6 is essential to support the large number of wireless-enabled devices that communicate using IP. By increasing the number of IP addresses available, IPv6 removes the need for network address translation (NAT), a method of sharing a limited number of addresses among a larger group of devices, which has a number of problems and limitations. When using IPv6, some kind of NAT is still required for communication with legacy IPv4 devices that are not also IPv6-connected.

, Verizon has posted specifications that require any 4G devices on its network to support IPv6.

=== Advanced antenna systems ===
The performance of radio communications depends on an antenna system, termed smart or intelligent antenna. Recently, multiple antenna technologies are emerging to achieve the goal of 4G systems such as high rate, high reliability, and long range communications. In the early 1990s, to cater for the growing data rate needs of data communication, many transmission schemes were proposed. One technology, spatial multiplexing, gained importance for its bandwidth conservation and power efficiency. Spatial multiplexing involves deploying multiple antennas at the transmitter and at the receiver. Independent streams can then be transmitted simultaneously from all the antennas. This technology, called MIMO (as a branch of intelligent antenna), multiplies the base data rate by (the smaller of) the number of transmit antennas or the number of receive antennas. Apart from this, the reliability in transmitting high speed data in the fading channel can be improved by using more antennas at the transmitter or at the receiver. This is called &quot;transmit&quot; or &quot;receive diversity&quot;. Both transmit/receive diversity and transmit spatial multiplexing are categorized into the space-time coding techniques, which does not necessarily require the channel knowledge at the transmitter. The other category is closed-loop multiple antenna technologies, which require channel knowledge at the transmitter.

=== Open-wireless Architecture and Software-defined radio (SDR) ===
One of the key technologies for 4G and beyond is called Open Wireless Architecture (OWA), supporting multiple wireless air interfaces in an open architecture platform.

SDR is one form of open wireless architecture (OWA). Since 4G is a collection of wireless standards, the final form of a 4G device will constitute various standards. This can be efficiently realized using SDR technology, which is categorized to the area of the radio convergence.

== History of 4G and pre-4G technologies ==

The 4G system was originally envisioned by the DARPA, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. DARPA selected the distributed architecture and end-to-end Internet protocol (IP), and believed at an early stage in peer-to-peer networking in which every mobile device would be both a transceiver and a router for other devices in the network, eliminating the spoke-and-hub weakness of 2G and 3G cellular systems. Since the 2.5G GPRS system, cellular systems have provided dual infrastructures: packet switched nodes for data services, and circuit switched nodes for voice calls. In 4G systems, the circuit-switched infrastructure is abandoned and only a packet-switched network is provided, while 2.5G and 3G systems require both packet-switched and circuit-switched network nodes, i.e. two infrastructures in parallel. This means that in 4G traditional voice calls are replaced by IP telephony.

* In December 2009, Sprint began advertising &quot;4G&quot; service in selected cities in the United States, despite average download speeds of only 3–6 Mbit/s with peak speeds of 10 Mbit/s (not available in all markets).
* On 14 December 2009, the first commercial LTE deployment was in the Scandinavian capitals Stockholm and Oslo by the Swedish-Finnish network operator TeliaSonera and its Norwegian brandname NetCom (Norway). TeliaSonera branded the network &quot;4G&quot;. The modem devices on offer were manufactured by Samsung (dongle GT-B3710), and the network infrastructure created by Huawei (in Oslo) and Ericsson (in Stockholm). TeliaSonera plans to roll out nationwide LTE across Sweden, Norway and Finland. TeliaSonera used spectral bandwidth of 10 MHz, and single-in-single-out, which should provide physical layer net bit rates of up to 50 Mbit/s downlink and 25 Mbit/s in the uplink. Introductory tests showed a TCP throughput of 42.8 Mbit/s downlink and 5.3 Mbit/s uplink in Stockholm.
* On 4 June 2010, Sprint released the first WiMAX smartphone in the US, the HTC Evo 4G.
* On November 4, 2010, the Samsung Craft offered by MetroPCS is the first commercially available LTE smartphone
* On 6 December 2010, at the ITU World Radiocommunication Seminar 2010, the ITU stated that LTE, WiMAX and similar &quot;evolved 3G technologies&quot; could be considered &quot;4G&quot;.
* In 2011, Argentina&#x27;s Claro launched a pre-4G HSPA+ network in the country.
* In 2011, Thailand&#x27;s Truemove-H launched a pre-4G HSPA+ network with nationwide availability.
* On March 17, 2011, the HTC Thunderbolt offered by Verizon in the U.S. was the second LTE smartphone to be sold commercially.
* In February 2012, Ericsson demonstrated mobile-TV over LTE, utilizing the new eMBMS service (enhanced Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service).

Since 2009, the LTE-Standard has strongly evolved over the years, resulting in many deployments by various operators across the globe. For an overview of commercial LTE networks and their respective historic development see: List of LTE networks. Among the vast range of deployments, many operators are considering the deployment and operation of LTE networks. A compilation of planned LTE deployments can be found at: List of planned LTE networks.

== Disadvantages ==
4G introduces a potential inconvenience for those who travel internationally or wish to switch carriers. In order to make and receive 4G voice calls (VoLTE), the subscriber handset must not only have a matching frequency band (and in some cases require unlocking), it must also have the matching enablement settings for the local carrier and/or country. While a phone purchased from a given carrier can be expected to work with that carrier, making 4G voice calls on another carrier&#x27;s network (including international roaming) may be impossible without a software update specific to the local carrier and the phone model in question, which may or may not be available (although fallback to 2G/3G for voice calling may still be possible if a 2G/3G network is available with a matching frequency band).

== Beyond 4G research ==
A major issue in 4G systems is to make the high bit rates available in a larger portion of the cell, especially to users in an exposed position in between several base stations. In current research, this issue is addressed by macro-diversity techniques, also known as group cooperative relay, and also by Beam-Division Multiple Access (BDMA).

Pervasive networks are an amorphous and at present entirely hypothetical concept where the user can be simultaneously connected to several wireless access technologies and can seamlessly move between them (See vertical handoff, IEEE 802.21). These access technologies can be Wi-Fi, UMTS, EDGE, or any other future access technology. Included in this concept is also smart-radio (also known as cognitive radio) technology to efficiently manage spectrum use and transmission power as well as the use of mesh routing protocols to create a pervasive network.

== The future of 4G ==
As of 2023, many countries and regions have started the transition from 4G to 5G, the next generation of cellular technology. 5G promises even faster speeds, lower latency, and the ability to connect a vast number of devices simultaneously.

4G networks are expected to coexist with 5G networks for several years, providing coverage in areas where 5G is not available.

<doc id="486550" wikidata="Q886760" url="?curid=486550" title="Blood curse">
<text>The term &quot;blood curse&quot; refers to a New Testament passage from the Gospel of Matthew, which describes events taking place in Pilate&#x27;s court before the crucifixion of Jesus, and specifically the alleged willingness of the Jewish crowd to accept liability for Jesus&#x27; death.

==Biblical narrative==
 reads:
==Interpretation==
This passage has no counterpart in the other Gospels and is probably related to the destruction of Jerusalem in the year 70 CE. German Protestant theologian Ulrich Luz (b. 1938) describes it as &quot;redactional fiction&quot; invented by the author of the Matthew Gospel. Some writers, viewing it as part of Matthew&#x27;s anti-Jewish polemic, see in it the seeds of later Christian antisemitism. In the view of the late Graham Stanton, a British New Testament scholar in the Reformed tradition, &quot;Matthew&#x27;s anti-Jewish polemic should be seen as part of the self-definition of the Christian minority which is acutely aware of the rejection and hostility of its &#x27;mother&#x27; Judaism.&quot; Howard Clark Kee has written, &quot;The bitter words he [Matthew] attributes to the Jews have caused endless harm in arrousing anti-Jewish emotions.&quot; Donald A. Hagner, a Presbyterian New Testament scholar and theologian, has written, &quot;It cannot be denied that this statement, unfortunately, has been used to promote anti-Semitism. The statement is formulaic, and the reference to &#x27;our children&#x27; does not make them guilty of the death of Jesus, let alone children or Jews of later generations.&quot;

===Anglican views===
N. T. Wright, an Anglican New Testament scholar and theologian, has stated, &quot;The tragic and horrible later use of Matthew 27.25 (&#x27;his blood be on us, and on our children&#x27;) as an excuse for &quot;soi-disant&quot; &#x27;Christian&#x27; anti-semitism is a gross distortion of its original meaning, where the reference is surely to the fall of Jerusalem.&quot;

Anglican theologian Rowan Williams, then Archbishop of Wales, and who would soon become Archbishop of Canterbury, has written of Matthew&#x27;s Gospel being made &quot;the tool of the most corrupt and murderous misreading of the passion stories that has disfigured the Church&#x27;s record&quot;.

===Catholic views===
In the Roman Catechism which was produced by the Council of Trent in the mid-16th century, the Catholic Church taught the belief that the collectivity of sinful humanity was responsible for the death of Jesus, not only the Jews. In the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), the Catholic Church under Pope Paul VI issued the declaration &quot;Nostra aetate&quot;, which repudiated the idea of a collective, multigenerational Jewish guilt for the crucifixion of Jesus. It declared that the accusation could not be made &quot;against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today&quot;.

The late Franz Mussner, a German Catholic New Testament scholar and theologian, has stated, &quot;No Christian can with a good conscience call upon Matt. 27:25 as a justification of his anti-Judaism. If the blood of Jesus comes upon the children of Israel, it comes upon them as a savior&#x27;s blood.&quot;

Pope Benedict XVI in his 2011 book &quot;Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week&quot; wrote:

Pilate&#x27;s need to declare his innocence, &quot;I am innocent of this man&#x27;s blood&quot;, has been interpreted as a reversal of roles: although historically, Jesus was on trial before Pilate, Pilate is also on trial before Jesus.

==Chrysostom==
St. John Chrysostom delivered a series of eight homilies to his Antioch congregation directed at members who continued to observe Jewish feasts and fasts. Critical of this, he cast Judaism and the synagogues in his city in a critical and negative light. His homilies were expressed in the conventional polemical form.

As quoted by St. Thomas Aquinas in his &quot;Catena Aurea&quot; (1263), Chrysostom said:

<text>Language engineering involves the creation of natural language processing systems, whose cost and outputs are measurable and predictable. It is a distinct field contrasted to natural language processing and computational linguistics. A recent trend of language engineering is the use of Semantic Web technologies for the creation, archiving, processing, and retrieval of machine processable language data.

<doc id="486558" wikidata="Q1356662" url="?curid=486558" title="Orlando Cepeda">
<text>Orlando Manuel Cepeda Pennes (; September 17, 1937 – June 28, 2024), nicknamed &quot;the Baby Bull&quot; and &quot;Peruchin&quot;, was a Puerto Rican first baseman in Major League Baseball who played for six teams from 1958 to 1974, primarily the San Francisco Giants. An 11-time All-Star, Cepeda was one of the most consistent power hitters in the National League (NL) through the 1960s and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999.

Breaking in with the Giants in their first season after relocating to San Francisco, he was named the NL Rookie of the Year by unanimous vote in 1958. Every year from 1958 through 1963, he was among the league leaders in batting, home runs, RBIs, slugging percentage, and total bases. In 1959, he became the first Puerto Rican player to start an All-Star Game, and in 1961 he was runner-up in voting for the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) after leading the league with 46 home runs and 142 RBIs, which remains the club record for right-handed hitters. In the ensuing years, the Giants struggled to fit both Cepeda and teammate Willie McCovey, also a first basemen, into their lineup, unsuccessfully trying to shift each of them to left field at different points.

After longstanding knee injuries forced Cepeda to miss most of the 1965 season, limiting him to pinch hitting duties, he was traded in May 1966 to the St. Louis Cardinals, coming back to finish the year with a .301 average. In 1967, Cepeda in helping the team to the NL pennant, won the MVP Award by unanimous vote. Another trade brought him to the Atlanta Braves, and he helped that team win the inaugural NL West division title in 1969. With his play increasingly limited by knee problems, he was traded to the American League shortly before its adoption of the designated hitter, and won the first Outstanding Designated Hitter Award with the Boston Red Sox in 1973 before his career came to an end the following year.

Cepeda struggled in his personal life after the end of his career. After a 1975 arrest for transporting marijuana from Colombia to Puerto Rico, he served ten months in prison and saw his reputation ruined on his home island. Following changes in his personal life, however, he repaired his image after being contracted by the Giants in 1987 to work as a scout and goodwill ambassador, beginning decades of humanitarian work.

==Early life==
Cepeda was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, to Pedro Aníbal Cepeda (1905/6–1955) and Carmen Pennes. The family was poor, and lived in wood houses without a telephone or refrigerator. His father was a professional baseball player in Puerto Rico, where he was known as &quot;Perucho&quot; and &quot;the Bull&quot;, and was widely considered one of the best players of his generation. Orlando was thus known as &quot;the Baby Bull&quot;. Cepeda saw his father play baseball for the first time in 1946, and was instantly interested in the game.

Because he was black and the bulk of his career was played before Jackie Robinson broke baseball&#x27;s color line in 1947, Perucho Cepeda could not play in the major leagues. Several players from the Negro leagues visited their house, which influenced Orlando&#x27;s view of the sport. He became a fan of Minnie Miñoso.

When he was 10 years old, Cepeda began to sell newspapers in order to participate in a baseball tournament organized for the paper boys. His first tryout came three years later. He practiced with the team for three months but did not make the roster. Cepeda then began playing basketball, but he tore cartilage in his knee and underwent surgery. The injury kept him inactive for nearly a year, and the doctor recommended that he avoid practicing basketball. He began practicing baseball again, noticing that his physical strength had significantly improved in two years.

One day, an amateur baseball player saw him play and recruited him to play with his team. The organization won Puerto Rico&#x27;s amateur championship and went on to play against an All-Star team from the Dominican Republic. Pedro Zorilla, then owner of the Santurce Crabbers, attended the game to scout another player, but after seeing Cepeda play, he became interested in him. In 1953, Zorilla brought him onto the team to work as a batboy. After retiring, Pedro Cepeda worked for the government, checking the water of rivers in the municipality. He contracted malaria, which eventually precipitated his death at age 49. This illness worsened the family&#x27;s living conditions. They moved from Guayama to Juncos, where their financial condition deteriorated. They moved again, this time to San Juan, where his mother worked odd jobs to support the family. After her father&#x27;s death, there was not sufficient income in the household to pay for Orlando to attend college.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
In 1955, Zorilla persuaded Cepeda&#x27;s family to purchase an airplane ticket so that he could participate in a New York Giants tryout. After passing the tryout, he was assigned by the Giants to Sandersville, a Class D team. Cepeda was subsequently transferred to the Salem Rebels, but he had trouble adapting because he did not speak English. He also encountered discrimination due to racial segregation under the Jim Crow laws. Shortly after this move, Zorilla called to inform him that his father was in critical condition. Pedro Cepeda died a few days later; Orlando paid the burial expenses and returned to Salem. He was depressed, which affected his performance. He wanted to quit and return to Puerto Rico, but Zorilla convinced him to play for the Kokomo Giants, a team in the Mississippi–Ohio Valley League. Walt Dixon, the team&#x27;s manager, assigned him to play third base. Cepeda batted in the cleanup spot, finishing with a .393 average, hitting 21 home runs with 91 RBIs.

Jim Tobin, who owned his contract, noticed his potential and sold his player&#x27;s rights back to the Giants. After a visit to Puerto Rico, Cepeda returned to New York before being sent to play with the St. Cloud Rox in Class C. The team re-assigned him to play first base. Cepeda adapted to the change quickly. That year, he won the Northern League Triple Crown, finishing with an average of .355 with 112 RBIs and 26 home runs. Jack Schwarz promoted him to Class B, a decision that he protested, noting that players with worse performance were being sent to Double A. Following a solid season in Class B, Cepeda played for the Crabbers in the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League (LBPPR) during the winter, concluding with a batting average of .310, 11 home runs, and 40 RBIs. He then signed a Class A contract with the Springfield Giants, accepting it on condition that he be allowed to play with the Minneapolis Millers in spring training. Cepeda had a slow start, but his performance improved as the season advanced, and the team retained him on their roster. After completing the 1957 season with the Millers, he returned to Puerto Rico and played in the LBPPR. While he was playing with Santurce, manager Bill Rigney, team owner Horace Stoneham and Tom Sheehan scouted him on behalf of the Giants, who had just moved from New York to San Francisco. He was invited to the team&#x27;s spring training along with other prospects, including Felipe Alou and Willie Kirkland.

===San Francisco Giants (1958–1966)===

Cepeda was called up by the San Francisco Giants in . His 13 home runs through May 31 that year place him in a tie with Joc Pederson (2015) for the second-most by a National League rookie through the end of May in baseball history, surpassed only by Albert Pujols (16, in 2001).

He signed his first major league contract ten minutes before debuting in the league, earning $7,000 for the season. In San Francisco, the team received significant media attention. Due to his performance, the team raised his salary to $9,500 in June. During the season, Cepeda lived with Rubén Gómez, but stopped doing so after some tension developed between them.

His average remained steady throughout the season, never falling below .305, which was his average in September. The Giants led the pennant race for a month, but their record in August and September was below .500, and they finished in third place with a record of 80–74, four games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates and twelve behind the Milwaukee Braves, who won their second consecutive pennant.

In his first season, Cepeda batted .312 with 25 home runs, 96 RBIs, and a league-leading 38 doubles. Cepeda and teammate Willie Mays were the only NL players to finish the season ranked among the leaders in hits, home runs, RBIs, batting average, runs scored, and stolen bases. He was unanimously selected the NL Rookie of the Year, becoming the second player, after Frank Robinson in 1956, to receive a unanimous vote. He was also selected the Most Valuable Giant in a poll conducted by the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;. On September 28, 1958, the publication presented him a plaque in recognition of the selection.

After the season concluded, Cepeda used his salary to buy a new house for his mother. That year he won the LBPPR batting title with an average of .362, while Santurce won the league&#x27;s championship. The Giants offered him a $12,000 contract, which he refused, asking for $20,000. After negotiations, the parties settled on $17,000.

In 1959, Cepeda reported to spring training with more confidence than the year before. He opened the season hitting in nine straight games, with 15 hits in his first 35 at bats. After experiencing a brief slump during the latter half of May, Cepeda recovered, hitting 12 home runs by June 4; that day he had four hits including a pair of home runs and a double, driving in seven runs in an 11–5 road win over the Braves. He was selected as a starter in both All-Star games during the season. Cepeda was briefly moved to third base to open a spot for Willie McCovey in the starting lineup, but was moved to the outfield after committing errors in the position. He hit six home runs between August and September. The Giants remained in the race for the pennant during the latter part of the season, but were eliminated from competition after losing a series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, eventually finishing third. Cepeda led the team in batting average (.317) and RBIs (105).

Cepeda subsequently moved from Daly City to the Sunset District, seeking a house within the city. In 1960, the Giants moved him back to first base after McCovey was sent to the minor leagues. Cepeda finished with an average of .297, with 24 home runs and 96 RBIs. He moved twice this year, first to 19th and Pacheco and then to 48th and Pacheco, where he and McCovey bought a building next to the ocean.

In 1961, Cepeda had what he considered to be the best statistics of his career. He led the league in RBIs (142), home runs (46), and at bats per home run (7.9). On July 4, in the first game of a road doubleheader against the Chicago Cubs, Cepeda had a spectacular game, going 5-for-5 with two doubles and a three-run home run that traveled over 500 feet to deep center field, driving in a career-high eight runs in a 19–3 blowout. He was once again selected to play in the All-Star Game starting lineup. The Giants led the league in runs scored, while the pitching staff had a collective earned run average (ERA) of 3.77. The team finished in third place. Cepeda finished second in the Most Valuable Player voting, after Frank Robinson. After the season, Cepeda – who at the time was earning $30,000 – asked for a $20,000 raise based on his performance. The general manager believed that he was making too much money for a fourth-year player, and the negotiations continued until a final salary of $46,000 was settled on. The 1962 Giants were an improved team, constantly rivaling the Dodgers for the league lead. Several players from the team, including Cepeda, participated in the All-Star Games. Finishing tied with the Dodgers, the Giants played against them in a playoff series to determine the National League champion. They won the best of three series 2–1. Cepeda batted .306 for the year, with 35 home runs and 114 RBIs. The team thus advanced to the World Series to face the New York Yankees; New York won in seven games. In 1961 and 1962, Cepeda had strong years; however, he had serious problems with manager Alvin Dark, to the point of almost skipping some games. Among the things that Dark did after being named manager was to order the Latin American players to stop speaking Spanish in the clubhouse. Cepeda immediately confronted him; after this, Dark avoided summoning the Hispanic players to any team meeting.

During the winter, Cepeda returned to the LBPPR, where he suffered a knee injury while training. In 1963, he played the entire season with the injury, not informing the Giants out of concern for his spot in the roster. He was in constant pain, but was in the race for a batting title along with Roberto Clemente, Dick Groat, and Tommy Davis, eventually finishing fifth. His batting average was .316, with 34 home runs and 97 RBIs. Before his 26th birthday, Cepeda had accumulated 1,105 hits, the 11th highest total for a 25-year-old player in MLB history.

In 1964, San Francisco remained in the pennant race until the last week, when the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the New York Mets to secure the flag. Cepeda led the team in batting average with .304 and a slugging percentage of .539. Cepeda attended 1965 spring training, having limited participation. One of his friends, who was from Mexico, brought in a jar with alcohol and cannabis to reduce the pain, noting that it was an &quot;old Mexican remedy&quot;. Noticing this, a clubhouse employee offered to bring him a cannabis &quot;joint&quot;, which he accepted. After this event, he consumed the drug regularly in order to &quot;relax&quot;. After experiencing swelling in the knee during the first games of the season, a group of doctors recommended that he stop playing, however, Cepeda refused to do so since baseball was his main source of income. He received treatment from Gene Sollovief, a Russian doctor who implemented a weight and exercise regime. He returned to action, but only had 34 at bats with an average of .176 and only one home run. He returned to Puerto Rico, undergoing further physical therapy. In the off-season, Cepeda also bought a house in Diamond Heights while his wife was pregnant with their son, Orlando Jr. After recovering from the injury, he attended 1966 spring training; however, he was not placed in the team&#x27;s starting lineup.

===St Louis Cardinals (1966–1968)===
In May 1966, the Giants traded Cepeda to the St. Louis Cardinals for pitcher Ray Sadecki. The Giants were playing a series against the Cardinals in St. Louis at the time of the trade, so Cepeda joined the team there. Bob Howsam, the Cardinals general manager, was interested in him because the team had problems on offense. After the trade, the team granted him a new contract for $53,000. With the help of Harry Caray, the Cardinals&#x27; announcer, Cepeda moved to a house in Olivette, Missouri. The team finished in sixth place, with a record of 83–79. He finished his first season with the Cardinals playing 123 games with an average of .303, and was named the NL Comeback Player of the Year.

In , the Cardinals entered the season with analysts giving them odds of 12–1 of winning the pennant. Cepeda began the season strongly, driving in seven runs in the first four games. The team promoted offensive performance by fining any player who left teammates on base a dollar; the money was used to pay for the postseason party. The Cardinals contended in the early league standings with the Chicago Cubs, but the team took control of the pennant race as the season progressed. Cepeda&#x27;s offense remained stable, finishing June as the league&#x27;s leader in doubles. He played in his seventh All-Star Game, which the National League won 2–1. Cepeda was named NL Player of the Month for the only time in his career in August, when he batted .352 with 5 home runs and 25 RBIs. The Cardinals won the pennant by 10 games (101–60), and defeated the Boston Red Sox in seven games to win the World Series. Cepeda concluded the season hitting .325, with 21 game-winning hits and a league-leading 111 RBIs. He was named the National League Most Valuable Player. Cepeda was the second NL player, after Carl Hubbell, to win the award unanimously. He, Albert Pujols, Frank Robinson, and Mike Trout are also the only players in major league history to win both the Rookie of the Year and MVP awards unanimously. Cepeda was the first Latin player to win the home run and RBI titles.

In 1968, the Cardinals were considered the strongest team in the majors. They won the pennant for a second straight year, this time by a nine-game margin. The Detroit Tigers won the American League pennant by twelve games. Cepeda, who had a low average in the 1967 World Series, hit a home run that gave the Cardinals a two games to one lead. The Tigers, however, won three of the next four games to win their first World Series since 1945. This season was called the &quot;Year of the Pitcher&quot;, because of the overwhelming dominance pitching had over offense. Cepeda had the worst statistical year of his career as a regular player, finishing with an average of .248 with 16 home runs and 73 RBIs, scoring career lows in all three statistics. He reported late to spring training in 1969, not showing up until one day before the Cardinals&#x27; first exhibition game.

===Atlanta Braves (1969–1972)===
Just before the season started, the Cardinals traded Cepeda to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for Joe Torre. The trade took him by surprise. After learning that his new team was the Braves, he considered retirement, but decided against it after discussing it with his wife.

Cepeda moved to Atlanta with uncertainty, wondering if the effect of the Jim Crow laws was still present, but his concerns disappeared once they settled. Cepeda attended 1969 spring training in West Palm Beach, being welcomed to the team by Hank Aaron. On August 4, Cepeda hit his 300th home run in a 7–1 road loss to the Montreal Expos. For the first time, baseball&#x27;s postseason had best-of-five playoffs, and the Braves won the National League West with a record of 93–69, before losing to the Mets in the NL Championship Series. Cepeda compiled a season average of .257, with 22 home runs and 88 RBIs.

In 1970, Rico Carty of the Braves led the league in batting average, while Cepeda and Aaron each drove in more than one hundred runs. On July 11, Cepeda reached the 2,000-hit mark with three hits including a home run in a 7–6 loss to the Reds. On July 26, in the first game of a doubleheader in Chicago, he had the only three-home run game of his career, driving in seven runs in an 8–3 win; all three home runs were hit off Bill Hands, the last of them a grand slam. However, the Braves pitching staff was ineffective, and the team finished in fourth place in the division. Cepeda finished with an average of .305, 34 home runs and 111 RBIs. In 1971, Cepeda began the season with solid offense, hitting 10 home runs before May was over. However, he re-injured one of his knees in his house. The Braves&#x27; physician administered a shot, but that proved ineffective. Cepeda was attended to by Dr. Funk, the Atlanta Falcons&#x27; orthopedist. After running tests and examining X-rays, he determined that the injury was serious. Because of this, Cepeda began playing part-time. His batting average declined, and he hit only five more home runs that season. In September, Cepeda traveled to New York where he underwent surgery, returning to Puerto Rico to recover during the winter. In 1972, he began playing while still feeling pain. On May 16, Cepeda hit two home runs against the Houston Astros. During this time, Paul Richards had been replaced by Eddie Robinson as the team general manager. Robinson did not assign treatment for Cepeda&#x27;s leg, eventually deciding to trade him.

===Oakland Athletics (1972)===
In July, Cepeda was traded to the Oakland Athletics for Denny McLain. After playing for a week, strictly as a pinch hitter, he was hospitalized and underwent a second surgery on his injured knee. Cepeda remained in Oakland three months before returning to Puerto Rico. Upon arriving, he received a telegram from Charlie Finley, the Athletics&#x27; owner, telling him that if he did not respond within three days he would be released from his contract. Cepeda decided not to call, intending to retire from baseball.

===Boston Red Sox (1973)===
In 1973, the American League established the designated hitter rule, hoping to improve attendance. The Red Sox contacted him, telling him that his role with the team only required batting. Cepeda became the first player to sign a contract to exclusively play as a designated hitter. His first hit with the team was a walk-off home run on April 8 to beat the Yankees 4–3, and on August 8 he had a career-high four doubles and six RBIs in a 9–4 road win against the Kansas City Royals. Cepeda finished the year with an average of .289 with 20 home runs and 86 RBIs in 550 at bats. He was awarded the Outstanding Designated Hitter Award. Cepeda&#x27;s 20th home run established a major league record, making him the first player to hit 20 or more home runs with four different teams.

===Kansas City Royals (1974)===
After briefly playing in Mexico, he was offered a contract by the Royals. In his last season, Cepeda batting .215 with 1 home run and 18 RBIs.

Cepeda was the second player from Puerto Rico to win a triple crown in Minor League Baseball, doing so in 1956 with a batting average of .355, 26 home runs, and 112 RBIs. He was selected as an All-Star seven times, appearing in 11 games (1959–64, 1967). He was the first Puerto Rican to start in an All-Star Game and to be selected in two positions, serving as a first baseman and left fielder. His lifetime numbers in the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League are a .325 batting average (fifth place), 89 home runs, 340 runs batted in and a .544 slugging percentage (second place, and only Puerto Rican with .500+). He batted over .300 nine times.

The following year, Cepeda tried a comeback in the Puerto Rican Baseball League. Upon noticing that his body couldn&#x27;t perform as well as it did before, he opted to retire instead.

===Legal issues===
After retiring, that same year, Cepeda traveled to Colombia to direct a baseball clinic; once there, he met a group of drug dealers who convinced him to put bags containing five pounds of cannabis in two boxes containing hand-made clothing. Cepeda had used cannabis since 1965. He returned to Puerto Rico, waiting ten days before contacting the airport to see if the boxes had arrived. When Cepeda arrived to collect his cargo, he was told that they could not be released, since the shipping cost had not been covered; the shipment actually weighed , far more than he had been expecting. At that point, two police officers (who were aware of the packages&#x27; contents) instructed one of the air freight employees to give Cepeda the boxes with or without payment. An airport employee delivered the boxes to Cepeda&#x27;s car, and once Cepeda returned to his vehicle, he was arrested and charged with drug possession.

While on trial for that charge, Cepeda was arrested a second time, after a man alleged that Cepeda had pointed a gun at him. A third case was brought by Pino, seeking an increase in alimony and child support payments. In 1978, after three days at trial, Cepeda was declared guilty of the drug possession charges and sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Cepeda served ten months in jail time and the balance of his sentence on probation. Following his release, a district attorney in Puerto Rico told the prison&#x27;s warden that if Cepeda returned, the mafia would likely attempt to kill him, leading to Cepeda&#x27;s assignment to a halfway house in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

After completing that program, Cepeda coached a LBPPR team in Bayamón, Puerto Rico and was later hired as a scout by the Chicago White Sox. In 1981, the team assigned him to work as a roving instructor with one of their minor league clubs in Lynn, Massachusetts. General manager Roland Hemond released him later that year, and he briefly worked as the Crabbers&#x27; coach.

===Return to the Giants and community work===
In 1987, Max Shapiro asked him to substitute for McCovey in a &quot;fantasy baseball camp&quot; in San Francisco, and although reluctant at first, he accepted. There he met and befriended publisher Laurence Hyman, who introduced Cepeda to Giants staff members and encouraged him to write to general manager Al Rosen. After initially receiving no response, eventually Patrick J. Gallagher called to tell Cepeda that Rosen wanted to hire him as a scout. Cepeda worked in the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and other Latin American countries during his first year, after which the Giants placed him on full-time payroll. Cepeda later worked as a goodwill ambassador for the Giants, attending activities in schools, hospitals, and community centers, and he represented the Giants in programs aimed at Latin American communities. Having joined the Sōka Gakkai International, he also participated in activities for Puerto Rican communities in New York.

Cepeda threw the honorary first pitch for the third game of the 1989 National League Championship Series, and also for a regular-season game between the Giants and Dodgers on September 17, 1997, his 60th birthday. Cepeda had his own concession stand at the new Giants stadium which opened in 2000, now called Oracle Park. Among the offerings at Orlando&#x27;s Caribbean BBQ is the &quot;Caribbean Cha Cha Bowl&quot; in reference to his nickname for his taste for jazz and Latin music. In 2006, the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) approved a chapter for Puerto Rico, the first in Latin America, and named the chapter in honor of Cepeda. In 2008 a 9-foot bronze sculpture of Cepeda in a Giants uniform of the early 1960s was unveiled at the new ballpark. Cepeda was only the fourth Giant to be honored with such a statue, following Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Gaylord Perry, and Juan Marichal. On September 16, 2017, the day before his 80th birthday, he attended a birthday celebration at Oracle Park where the Giants honored him, including distributing statuettes of him to the first 20,000 fans at the game.

==Legacy==

By the early 1990s, when his time of initial eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame was beginning to run out, many Puerto Ricans, celebrities, and ordinary citizens alike began to campaign for his induction. Some international celebrities and former teammates also joined in the campaign. In 1994, his last year of eligibility in voting by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America, he came within nine votes of being elected. In , he was elected by the Hall&#x27;s Veterans Committee, joining Roberto Clemente as the only other Puerto Rican in Cooperstown. They have since been joined by Roberto Alomar, Iván Rodríguez, and Edgar Martínez.

Cepeda belongs to 14 halls of fame, the most by any Puerto Rican athlete: the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame (1990), Puerto Rico Baseball Hall of Fame (1991), Laredo Latin American International Sports Hall of Fame (1995), Santurce Hall of Fame (1997), Puerto Rico Sports Hall of Fame (1993), Baseball Hall of Fame, Cooperstown (1999), Missouri Sports Hall of Fame (2000), Guayama Hall of Fame (2000), Ponce Hall of Fame (2001), Cataño Hall of Fame (2002), Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame (2002), African American Ethnic Sports Hall of Fame (2007),
San Francisco Giants Hall of Fame (2008) and Latinoamerican Baseball Hall of Fame (2010).

Cepeda was recognized nationally for his humanitarian efforts as an ambassador for baseball. He served as an honorary spokesman for the Crohn&#x27;s and Colitis Foundation of America.

In 2001, he won the Ernie Banks Positive Image Lifetime Achievement Award. The citation for the award reads, in part, &quot;The legacy he is leaving is an impressive one indeed. His commitment to community service includes credentials for a Humanitarian Hall of Fame. He is now recognized nationally for his humanitarian efforts as an ambassador for baseball and the San Francisco Giants.&quot; It goes on to list many of his national and community contributions, including his regular visits to inner-city schools throughout the country in conjunction with HOPE: Helping Other People Excel. &quot;Each December, Orlando tours as part of the Giants Christmas Caravan visiting hospitals, schools and youth groups including the UC San Francisco Medical Center pediatric cancer ward. He was a participant in Athletes Against AIDS. He was also a public speaker for the Omega Boys and Girls Club, counseling at-risk children in the San Francisco community. He was revered in the local community and a local band has a song that celebrates him.

The Giants retired Cepeda&#x27;s number 30 in 1999. It hangs on the facing of the upper deck in the left field corner of Oracle Park. On September 6, 2008, the Giants unveiled a life-size statue of Cepeda at the northern corner of the stadium in recognition of his status as one of the greatest Giants of all time. He was the fifth Giant to be honored with a statue; the other players are Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Juan Marichal, and Gaylord Perry.

Cepeda continued to be a part of the Giants front office staff and was often involved with the team&#x27;s spring training activities.

He was also recognized at Ponce&#x27;s Parque de los Ponceños Ilustres in the area of sports.

==Personal life==
On December 3, 1960, Cepeda married Annie Pino in a ceremony that took place in a small church of San Juan. This was followed by a large reception at the Caribe Hilton Hotel. He and Pino divorced in 1973.

After the couple separated, he met Nydia Fernandez, who was from Carolina, Puerto Rico. The couple married in 1975, and had two children together, Malcom and Ali. Cepeda also had two other sons, Orlando Cepeda Jr. and Carl Cepeda.

A former Catholic, Cepeda began practicing Nichiren Buddhism as a member of the Buddhist association Soka Gakkai International in 1983. One year later, he moved to Los Angeles, renting an apartment in Burbank. During this timeframe, his relationship with Fernandez deteriorated. She eventually left the house and returned to Puerto Rico with Malcom and Ali and filed a divorce suit. A friend introduced Cepeda to Miriam Ortiz, whom he eventually married. Miriam died in 2017.

===Health issues and death===
Cepeda was hospitalized in February 2018 after a fall. He suffered what was called a &quot;cardiac episode and head injury&quot; and a stroke after falling in a parking lot at the Rancho Solano Golf Course complex in Fairfield, California. He was hospitalized for several months before being released.

In 2020, Cepeda sued his daughter-in-law alleging &quot;elder financial abuse, fraud, negligence in handling his finances after he granted her power of attorney in 2018, and infliction of emotional distress.&quot; He also denied suffering from dementia.

Cepeda died on June 28, 2024, at the age of 86. He was buried next to his mother at Juncos Old Municipal Cemetery in Juncos, Puerto Rico. His death occurred 10 days after that of his former teammate Willie Mays.

<doc id="486560" wikidata="Q6831087" url="?curid=486560" title="Trylon and Perisphere">
<text>The Trylon and Perisphere were two monumental modernistic structures designed by architects Wallace Harrison and J. Andre Fouilhoux that were together known as the Theme Center of the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, New York City, United States. The Perisphere was a tremendous sphere, in diameter, connected to the spire-shaped Trylon by what was at the time the world&#x27;s longest escalator. The Perisphere housed a diorama by Henry Dreyfuss called &quot;Democracity&quot; which, in keeping with the fair&#x27;s theme &quot;The World of Tomorrow&quot;, depicted a utopian city-of-the-future. The interior display was viewed from above on a moving sidewalk, while a multi-image slide presentation was projected on the dome of the sphere. After exiting the Perisphere, visitors descended to ground level on the third element of the Theme Center, the Helicline, a spiral ramp that partially encircled the Perisphere.

The name &quot;Perisphere&quot; was coined using the Greek prefix &quot;peri-&quot;, meaning &quot;all around&quot;, &quot;about&quot;, or &quot;enclosing&quot;. The name &quot;Trylon&quot; was coined from the phrase &quot;triangular pylon&quot;.

==Construction==
The Theme Center was designed by architects Wallace Harrison and J. Andre Fouilhoux, with the interior exhibit by Henry Dreyfuss. The structures were built in Flushing Meadows Park in Queens, New York and were intended as temporary with steel framing and plaster board facades. Both buildings were subsequently razed and scrapped after the closing of the fair, their materials to be used in World War II armaments.

==Legacy==

The Trylon and Perisphere became the central symbol of the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, its image reproduced by the millions on a wide range of promotional materials and serving as the fairground&#x27;s focal point. The United States Postal Service issued a postage stamp in 1939 depicting the Trylon and Perisphere. Neither structure survives; however, the Unisphere, the symbol of the 1964–65 New York World&#x27;s Fair, is now located where the Perisphere once stood.

<text>Zacharias Janssen; also Zacharias Jansen or Sacharias Jansen; 1585 – pre-1632) was a Dutch spectacle-maker who lived most of his life in Middelburg. He is associated with the invention of the first optical telescope and/or the first truly compound microscope, but these claims (made 20 years after his death) may be fabrications put forward by his son.

==Biography==
Zacharias Janssen was born in The Hague. Local records seem to indicate he was born in 1585 although a date of birth as early as 1580 or as late as 1588 are also given. His parents were Hans Martens (who may have been a peddler) and Maeyken Meertens, both probably from Antwerp, Belgium. He grew up with his sister Sara in Middelburg, at the time the second most important city of the Netherlands. He was known as a &quot;street seller&quot; who was constantly in trouble with the local authorities.

He stated he was born in The Hague on the marriage file of his first marriage, with Catharina de Haene, on October 23, 1610. When this file was refound by Cornelis de Waard in 1906, De Waard found the following excerpt: &quot;Sacharias Jansen, j.g. uut Den Haag&quot;, &quot;Zacharias Jansen, bachelor from The Hague&quot; Before, it was often thought that Janssen was a native of Middelburg. In 1612, Zacharias and Catharina had a son they named Johannes Zachariassen.

In 1615 Zacharias was appointed guardian of two children of Lowys Lowyssen &quot;geseyt Henricxen brilmakers&quot; (&quot;called Henry the spectacle maker&quot;). It is surmised that Zacharias also took possession of Lowys Lowyssen&#x27;s spectacle-making tools because the first record of Zacharias Janssen being a spectacle maker appears in 1616. The family had to move to Arnemuiden in 1618 after Zacharias&#x27;s counterfeiting activities were exposed. There Zacharias was again accused of counterfeiting in 1619, causing him to be on the move again, ending up back in Middelburg in 1621.

A year after the death of Janssen&#x27;s first wife in 1624, he married Anna Couget from Antwerp, who was the widow of a Willem Jansen (probably a relative of Janssen). He moved to Amsterdam in November 1626 with a profession of a spectacle maker, but was bankrupt by 1628. Janssen has been given a death date as late as 1638 although his sister said he was dead in 1632 testimony and his son Johannes declared his parents had died by the time of his marriage in April 1632.

== Alleged invention of the telescope and microscope ==

Over the years there have been claims Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope and/or the microscope in Middelburg between 1590 and 1618. Zacharias worked for some time in the very competitive and secretive trade of spectacle-making and at one time lived next door to Middelburg spectacle maker Hans Lippershey, who is also claimed to have invented the telescope. Janssen&#x27;s attribution to these discoveries is debatable since there is no concrete evidence as to the actual inventor, and there are a whole series of confusing and conflicting claims from the testimony of his son and fellow countrymen.

The claim that Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope and the microscope dates back to the year 1655. During that time Dutch diplomat Willem Boreel conducted an investigation trying to figure out who invented the telescope. He had a local magistrate in Middelburg follow up on a 45 year old recollection of a spectacle maker named &quot;Hans&quot; who told a young Boreel in 1610 about inventing the telescope. In his investigation the magistrate was contacted by a then unknown claimant, Middelburg spectacle maker Johannes Zachariassen, the son of Zacharias Janssen, who testified under oath that his father invented the telescope and the microscope as early as 1590 and that Hans Lippershey had stolen his father&#x27;s invention of the telescope. This testimony seemed convincing to Boreel, who modified his recollections, concluding that Zacharias must have been who he remembered. Boreel&#x27;s conclusion that Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope a little ahead of spectacle maker Hans Lippershey was adopted by Pierre Borel in his 1656 book on the subject.

In Boreel&#x27;s investigation Johannes also claimed his father, Zacharias Janssen, invented the compound microscope in 1590. For this to be true (Zacharias most likely dates of birth would have made him 2–5 years old at the time) some historians concluded grandfather Hans Martens must have invented it.

Other claims have come forward over the years. Physicist Jean Henri van Swinden&#x27;s 1822-23 investigation reached the conclusion supporting Janssen and in 1841 a collector named Zacharias Snijder came forward with 4 iron tubes with lenses in them purported to be Janssen original telescopes. In historian Cornelis de Waard&#x27;s 1906 book on the history of the telescope he recounted his discovery of a note written in 1634 by the Dutch philosopher Isaac Beeckman in which Beeckman mentioned that Johannes Zachariassen claimed his father created his first telescope in 1604 (and that it was a copy of an Italian device from 1590). The German astronomer Simon Marius&#x27;s account to his patron Johan Philip Fuchs von Bimbach about meeting an unnamed Dutchman at the 1608 Autumn Frankfurt Fair who tried to sell him a device that sounded like a broken telescope has led to later speculation this unnamed Dutchman could have been Zacharias Janssen.

===Controversy===
The confusion surrounding the claim to invention of the telescope and the microscope arises in part from the (sometimes conflicting) testimony of Zacharias Janssen&#x27;s son, Johannes Zachariassen. Johannes&#x27; various claims include that his father invented the telescope in 1590, that his father invented the telescope in 1604, that in 1618 he and his father invented the Keplerian telescope (a design using two positive lenses proposed by Johannes Kepler in 1611), and that (Adriaan) Metius and Cornelis Drebbel bought a telescope from him and his father in 1620 and copied it. Johannes also seems to have lied about his own date of birth, maybe so he could stake his own claim as inventor of the telescope along with his father.

The 1655 investigation by William Boreel (who may have been a childhood friend of Zacharias Zachariassen) added to the confusion over invention. The people he had the local magistrate interview were trying to recount details 50 or 60 years after the fact and Boreel may have confused the names of spectacle makers from his childhood. He may have also been confused about a microscope built by another optician for Drebbel, claiming it was built by Zacharias Janssen.

An investigation begun in 1816 in preparation for a memorial to commemorate Janssen as the inventor of the telescope and microscope turned up further problems with the claim including the 1608 Lippershey and Metius patent applications, Janssen late 1585 date of birth, and no record of him being a spectacle maker before 1615.

Albert Van Helden, Sven Dupré, Rob Van Gent, and Huib Zuidervaart in their book &quot;Origins of the Telescope&quot; came to the conclusion that Janssen may not have become an optician until 1616 and that the claims surrounding him as the inventor of the telescope and the microscope were the fabrications of his own son, Johannes Zachariassen, who claimed it as a matter of fame and for possible financial gain.

==Illegal activities==
In the years 1613–1619, Janssen was tried several times for counterfeiting coins. Janssen grew up right next to the Middelburg mint where his brother-in-law worked. These circumstances made it very easy for Janssen to mimic the process of producing fake money. He fled to the neighbouring village of Arnemuiden to avoid the high penalties for counterfeiting coins.

However, he continued counterfeiting coins in Arnemuiden. In 1619 he was apprehended for owning several devices he counterfeited coins with. Normally, one would have been sentenced to death for this crime. However, since the father of the Arnemuiden bailiff was found to be an accessory, he was pardoned from this punishment. Thanks to this, the process was delayed to such an extent that Janssen was able to flee again. Eventually, the case was dismissed. Janssen returned to Middelburg in 1621.

==Historical record==
Janssen&#x27;s life was documented by the many investigations on the subject before the Second World War. Many of the Middelburg archives were destroyed by a bombing of Middelburg on May 17, 1940, during the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands. Without these earlier studies, very little would be known of Janssen&#x27;s life at all because all original files were lost in the fires following the bombardment.

The super-Earth 55 Cancri e is named &quot;Janssen&quot; in his honor.

<doc id="486577" wikidata="Q5398584" url="?curid=486577" title="Esmonde and Larbey">
<text>Esmonde and Larbey were a British television screenwriting duo, consisting of John Gilbert Esmonde (21 March 1937 – 10 August 2008) and Robert Edward Larbey (24 June 1934 – 31 March 2014), who created popular sitcoms starting from the mid-1960s until the mid-1990s such as &quot;Please Sir!&quot;, &quot;The Good Life&quot;, &quot;Get Some In!&quot;, &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot;, and &quot;Brush Strokes&quot;.

==Biographies==
Bob Larbey made his writing debut for BBC radio, before contributing a film adaptation, &quot;Mrs Silly&quot;, starring Maggie Smith. Larbey met his future writing partner when they were pupils at Henry Thornton School, South Side, Clapham Common. He was born in Clapham, South London and died in London aged 79 in March 2014.

John Esmonde served a couple of years in the Royal Air Force in Air Ambulance before realising that his budding writing partnership with Larbey might prove more fruitful. Three years of after-hours writing yielded a BBC joint fee of two guineas for the pair in 1965, as they began to have sketches accepted on shows such as &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot; and &quot;The Dick Emery Show&quot;. Born in Battersea, South West London, Esmonde was married to Georgina Barton from 1960 until his death in Spain in August 2008, aged 71.

==Collaboration==
Esmonde and Larbey&#x27;s first sitcom as a writing team came in 1966 with &quot;Room at the Bottom&quot; for the BBC. This followed the exploits of a group of maintenance men working for Saracens Manufacturing Company. Starting out as a pilot in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; programme, it lasted for one series the next year, starring Kenneth Connor, Deryck Guyler and Francis Matthews.

The BBC radio comedy &quot;You&#x27;re Only Old Once&quot;, also starring Deryck Guyler who appeared alongside Clive Dunn and Joan Sanderson, was broadcast between February 1968 and July 1969.

Also in 1968, Esmonde and Larbey created &quot;Please Sir!&quot;, a situation comedy which starred John Alderton as a naive teacher thrown in at the deep end in a tough south London school. Rejected by the BBC, the series was accepted by London Weekend Television, whose head of comedy was then Frank Muir.

The success of &quot;Please Sir!&quot; led to Esmonde and Larbey being commissioned to write a sequel – &quot;The Fenn Street Gang&quot; – which followed the former school pupils as they tried to make their way in the harsh world outside. This starred David Barry, Peter Cleall and Carol Hawkins. Making his debut in series 1, George Baker made such an impression as a wide-boy villain that the prequel &quot;Bowler&quot; was launched in 1973. This lasted for one series and co-starred Fred Beauman, Renny Lister and Gretchen Franklin.

In the early to mid-1970s, Esmonde and Larbey produced several lesser-known comedies, sometimes lasting no longer than a pilot. These include ITV&#x27;s &quot;Cosmo And Thingy&quot;, set in prehistoric times featuring a cast of cavemen and cavewomen (based on a series of sketches they wrote for &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot;), and &quot;Football Crazy&quot; (also for ITV) which was a children&#x27;s sitcom about the football team Wormwood Rovers.

In 1975, Esmonde and Larbey created their best-known situation comedy: &quot;The Good Life&quot;, starring Richard Briers, Felicity Kendal, Paul Eddington and Penelope Keith. Set in Surbiton, London, it concerns itself with the attempts of Tom and Barbara Good (Briers and Kendal) to be self-sufficient after they decide to leave the rat race. It ran on the BBC until 1978, although it is still regularly repeated. At its peak, the show was attracting some 15 million viewers per week – nearly a quarter of the population at the time. The writers had &quot;just picked it [Surbiton] at random&quot;, Larbey once admitted. &quot;To be honest, we were just looking for something that sounded like suburbia in big capital letters.&quot; The show poked fun at the ideologies of both lead couples – the aggressively socially climbing Leadbetters and the self-sufficient (and self-satisfied) Goods. Larbey later said that while he was too impractical to embrace self-sufficiency, its general philosophy appealed to him.

Also beginning in 1975 was &quot;Get Some In!&quot; for ITV, a national service comedy set in 1955. It starred Tony Selby, Robert Lindsay, David Janson and Gerard Ryder.

Esmonde and Larbey teamed up with Michael Gambon and Briers again for another BBC Comedy Series called &quot;The Other One&quot; (1977–79), a sitcom about a man who is a liar who attempts to hide his insecurities through charade; it was successful enough for a second series to be broadcast. They returned to football with ITV&#x27;s &quot;Feet First&quot; (1979) starring Jonathan Barlow as Terry Prince, a local footballer given the chance to hit the big time. Also less successful than &quot;The Good Life&quot; was their sitcom for ITV &quot;Just Liz&quot; (1980) starring Sandra Payne. This was followed by &quot;Don&#x27;t Rock The Boat&quot; (1982–83) which starred Nigel Davenport.

After the short-lived &quot;Now And Then&quot; (ITV 1983) they returned to form with &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot;, which reunited the writers with Briers. Briers starred as Martin Bryce, an insecure and obsessive character whose need to be the leading light of local activities is undermined by the arrival of a talented and charming neighbour, Paul Ryman. The series also featured Penelope Wilton as Martin&#x27;s long suffering wife Anne, and Peter Egan as Ryman.

Another hit for Esmonde and Larbey was &quot;Brush Strokes&quot; (1986–91), featuring Karl Howman and Gary Waldhorn as a house decorator and his boss. The BBC sitcom &quot;Double First&quot; (1988) only lasted one series, but marked a different approach. It starred Michael Williams.

The duo wrote &quot;Hope It Rains&quot; (1991–92) for ITV. It starred Tom Bell as the dour owner of a run-down seaside waxworks museum. Holly Aird and Eamon Boland also featured. There were 13 episodes transmitted.

Their last significant sitcom as a team was &quot;Mulberry&quot; (1992–93), again starring Karl Howman, here as an apprentice Grim Reaper who has to guide an elderly spinster (Geraldine McEwan) to the next world as easily as possible.

===Larbey&#x27;s solo work===
By this time Larbey was also solo-writing the long-running BBC series &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; (1992–2005), starring Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer. While continuing his partnership with Esmonde, Larbey had been writing several sitcoms on his own throughout the 1980s and 1990s, most notably &quot;A Fine Romance&quot; starring Dench and her husband Michael Williams, which ran from 1981 to 1984. Along with the later &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, these two series were credited with &quot;catapulting Dench into the nation&#x27;s affections&quot; as they gave prime-time recognition to an actress who, until then, had largely confined herself to stage work and one-off TV dramas.

He was named to five Pro Bowls and three first-team All-Pros while appearing in two AFC Championship Games. In 2002, he was the first selection in the 2002 NFL expansion draft by the Houston Texans, but retired without playing for them due to injuries. His accomplishments with Jacksonville led to him becoming the first inductee of the Jaguars Hall of Fame, which he was named to in 2006. he was also the first player to have his number retired by the Jaguars in 2022.

Long Branch High School honors him to this day by hanging his high school jersey and his NFL jersey in the school gym. Although considered a great athlete in high school, Mills&#x27; 5&#x27;9&quot; frame did not interest college scouts.

==College career==
Mills attended college at Montclair State College (now known as Montclair State University) and made the football squad as a walk-on. He played for Montclair State from 1977 to 1980 where he is the all-time leader in career tackles with 501, tackles in a season (142), and tackles in a game (22). He was a three-time NJAC First Team All-Star and was named the New Jersey Collegiate Writers Defensive Player of the Year for three straight seasons (1978–1980).

==Professional career==
===Cleveland Browns and Toronto Argonauts===
Mills signed with the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent in 1981 but was released after the conclusion of preseason. He wore number 41, one of the two times he didn&#x27;t wear number 51, the other being with the Stars. In 1982, Mills signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League but was released before the season.

===Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars===
Fred Hill, who coached Mills at Montclair State, said that many pro scouts loved his tape, but when they heard he was only 5&#x27;9&quot;, they lost interest. Conventional wisdom at the time held that middle linebackers had to be at least six feet tall to see over opposing offensive linemen and scan the field. In the same way it was after high school, Mills&#x27; lack of height held him back. After college, his Pop Warner Football coach Thomas Bevacqui Jr. was able to get Mills invited to the Cleveland Browns training camp after meeting with Browns coach Sam Rutigliano. Bevacqui told Rutigliano that Mills was the best linebacker that he had ever seen play the game. While Rutigliano admired Mills, he didn&#x27;t think he had the size to play in the NFL and cut him from the team. Mills then tried out with the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Toronto Argonauts but did not make the team. He found a job teaching photography and assisting the football coach at East Orange (N.J.) High School.

However, Rutigliano still liked what he had seen of Mills in camp. He called an old friend, Carl Peterson, general manager of the Philadelphia Stars of the United States Football League, and suggested that he give Mills a look. Mills made his reputation at the Stars&#x27; first training camp; as Peterson recalled years later, &quot;he just lit it up.&quot; He quickly became known as the &quot;Field Mouse&quot; for his devastating speed; as Peterson put it, &quot;he was a mouse running around a field of elephants, but the elephants wanted nothing to do with him.&quot;

In his three years with the Stars (who moved to Baltimore in 1985), Mills became one of the anchors of the Stars&#x27; feared &quot;Doghouse Defense,&quot; During that time (wearing #54), he became known around the league for both his tenacity on the field and his leadership off it. Mills led the Stars to two USFL championships, was named to three All-USFL teams and is a member of the USFL&#x27;s All-Time Team. He has been described as arguably the best defensive player (along with Reggie White) in the short history of the league.

===New Orleans Saints===
After the Stars won the 1985 USFL title, their head coach Jim Mora was signed on to coach the New Orleans Saints, and Mills followed his mentor. During his tenure with the Saints which began in 1986, Mills was an anchor of the defense. He was a member of the vaunted &quot;Dome Patrol,&quot; the stellar linebacking corps that led a ferocious Saints defense in the early 1990s. Mills earned four Pro Bowl appearances with the Saints in 1987, 1988, 1991, and 1992. Mora, who coached 15 seasons in the NFL, called Mills &quot;The best player I ever coached.&quot;

===Carolina Panthers===
Mills became a free agent at the end of the 1994 NFL season. The expansion Carolina Panthers offered him a two-year, $2.8 million deal. While New Orleans matched the offer, Mills was displeased that the Saints did not make an offer until the Panthers forced their hand, and opted to sign with the Panthers.

Mills became a veteran leader for the young team, the only player to start every game during the Panthers&#x27; first three seasons. In a 1995 game against the New York Jets, Mills stepped in front of a Bubby Brister shovel pass and took it 36 yards for a touchdown, sealing the Panthers&#x27; first win in franchise history. His career rebirth gave him a fifth Pro Bowl appearance in 1996 at the age of 37 which, at the time, made him the oldest defender to be invited to a Pro Bowl. He retired after the following season.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Post-playing career==
Mills played 12 seasons in the NFL and recorded 1,319 tackles, 20.5 sacks, 11 interceptions and four touchdowns while starting 173 of 181 games. Mills was named to the NFL All-Pro team three times, in 1991, 1992, and 1996. He was elected to the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame (2001), the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame (2002), the Sports Hall of Fame of New Jersey (2003) and the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame (1998). After retiring from play, Mills was inducted into the Carolina Panthers Hall of Honor (1998). He became a defensive coaching assistant for the Panthers in 1998, before being promoted to linebackers coach in 1999.

==Cancer and death==
In August 2003, Mills was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. Though he was told he had only a few months to live, he was treated with chemotherapy and radiation and continued to coach. He was an inspirational force in the Panthers’ post-season run to Super Bowl XXXVIII. His plea to &quot;keep pounding&quot; in an emotional speech before the Panthers&#x27; victory over the Dallas Cowboys later became the name of a fund to sponsor cancer research programs and an official team slogan. He continued to coach the team until his death from cancer complications on April 18, 2005.

==Legacy==
Mills&#x27; jersey number 51 was retired by the Panthers at the start of the 2005 NFL season, making it the first number the franchise retired. Mills was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2009, with his son Sam Mills III accepting the award on his father&#x27;s behalf. Sam Mills III was the defensive line coach for the Washington Commanders.

The speech inspired the Carolina Panthers and Nike, when awarded the contract for NFL jerseys starting in the 2012 NFL season, to feature &quot;Keep Pounding&quot; sewn on the inside collars of Panthers jerseys for the 2012 NFL season, in honor of the elder Mills. Before the start of every home game, the Panthers have an honorary drummer bang a &quot;Keep Pounding&quot; drum. Though Carolina was not the designated home team for Super Bowl 50, the tradition remained a part of the game, with the drummer being Panther fan and Charlotte native Stephen Curry, the star point guard for the four-time NBA champion Golden State Warriors. Mills was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2022.

<doc id="486596" wikidata="Q455773" url="?curid=486596" title="Roy Acuff">
<text>Roy Claxton Acuff (September 15, 1903 – November 23, 1992) was an American country music singer, fiddler, and promoter. Known as the &quot;King of Country Music&quot;, Acuff is often credited with moving the genre from its early string band and &quot;hoedown&quot; format to the singer-based format that helped make it internationally successful. In 1952, Hank Williams told Ralph Gleason, &quot;He&#x27;s the biggest singer this music ever knew. You booked him and you didn&#x27;t worry about crowds. For drawing power in the South, it was Roy Acuff, then God.&quot;

Acuff began his music career in the 1930s and gained regional fame as the singer and fiddler for his group, the Smoky Mountain Boys. He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1938, and although his popularity as a musician waned in the late 1940s, he remained one of the Opry&#x27;s key figures and promoters for nearly four decades. In 1942, Acuff and Fred Rose founded Acuff-Rose Music, the first major Nashville-based country music publishing company, which signed such artists as Hank Williams, Roy Orbison, and the Everly Brothers. In 1962, Acuff became the first living inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Early life==

Acuff was born on September 15, 1903 in Maynardville, Tennessee, to Ida Florence (née Carr) and Simon E. Neill Acuff, the third of their five children. Acuff was of English ancestry, and his ancestors came to North America during the colonial era, settling in the mountains of Virginia and the Carolinas. The Acuffs were a fairly prominent family in Union County. Roy&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Coram Acuff, had been a Tennessee state senator, and his maternal grandfather was a local physician. Roy&#x27;s father was an accomplished fiddler and a Baptist preacher, his mother was proficient on the piano, and during Roy&#x27;s early years the Acuff house was a popular place for local gatherings. At such gatherings, Roy would often amuse people by balancing farm tools on his chin. He also learned to play the harmonica and jaw harp at an early age.

In 1919, the Acuff family relocated to Fountain City (now a neighborhood of Knoxville), a few miles south of Maynardville. Roy attended Central High School, where he sang in the school chapel&#x27;s choir and performed in &quot;every play they had.&quot; His primary passion, however, was athletics. He was a three-sport standout at Central, and after graduating in 1925, was offered a scholarship to Carson-Newman University, but turned it down. He played with several small baseball clubs around Knoxville, worked at odd jobs, and occasionally boxed.

In 1929, Acuff tried out for the Knoxville Smokies, a minor-league baseball team then affiliated with the New York Giants. A series of collapses in spring training following a sunstroke, however, ended his baseball career. The effects left him ill for several years, and he suffered a nervous breakdown in 1930. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t stand any sunshine at all,&quot; he later recalled. While recovering, Acuff began to hone his fiddle skills, often playing on the family&#x27;s front porch after the sun went down. His father gave him several records of regionally renowned fiddlers, such as Fiddlin&#x27; John Carson and Gid Tanner, which were important influences on his early style.

== Career ==

===Early music career===
In 1932, Dr. Hauer&#x27;s medicine show, which toured the southern Appalachian region, hired Acuff as one of its entertainers. Acuff began his career as a blackface performer. The purpose of the entertainers was to draw a large crowd to whom Hauer could sell patent medicines (of suspect quality) for various ailments. While on the medicine show circuit, Acuff met the legendary Appalachian banjoist Clarence Ashley, from whom he learned &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; and &quot;Greenback Dollar&quot;, both of which Acuff later recorded. As the medicine show lacked microphones, Acuff learned to sing loud enough to be heard above the din, a skill that later helped him stand out on early radio broadcasts.

In 1934, Acuff left the medicine show circuit and began playing at local shows with various musicians in the Knoxville area, where he had become a celebrity and fixture in local newspaper columns. That year, guitarist Jess Easterday and Hawaiian guitarist Clell Summey joined Acuff to form the Tennessee Crackerjacks, who performed regularly on the Knoxville radio stations WROL and WNOX (the band moved back and forth between stations as Acuff bickered with their managers about compensation). Within a year, the group had added bassist Red Jones and changed its name to the Crazy Tennesseans after being introduced as such by a WROL announcer named Alan Stout. Fans often remarked to Acuff how &quot;clear&quot; his voice was coming through over the radio, important in an era when singers were often drowned out by string-band cacophony. The popularity of Acuff&#x27;s rendering of the song &quot;The Great Speckled Bird&quot; helped the group land a contract with American Record Corporation, (ARC) for which they recorded several dozen tracks (including the band&#x27;s best-known track, &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot;) in 1936. Needing to complete a 20-song commitment, the band recorded two ribald tunes—including &quot;When Lulu&#x27;s Gone&quot;—but released them under a pseudonym, the Bang Boys. The group split from ARC in 1937 over a separate contract dispute.

===Grand Ole Opry===
In 1938, the Crazy Tennesseans moved to Nashville to audition for the Grand Ole Opry. Although their first audition went poorly, the band&#x27;s second audition impressed Opry founder George D. Hay and producer Harry Stone, and they offered the group a contract later that year. On Hay and Stone&#x27;s suggestion, Acuff changed the group&#x27;s name to the Smoky Mountain Boys, referring to the mountains near where his bandmates and he grew up. Shortly after the band joined the Opry, Clell Summey left the group and was replaced by Fiddle player Beecher (Pete) Kirby—best known by his stage name Bashful Brother Oswald—whom Acuff had met in a Knoxville bakery earlier that year. Acuff&#x27;s powerful lead vocals and Kirby&#x27;s dobro playing and high-pitched backing vocals gave the band its distinctive sound. By 1939, Jess Easterday had switched to bass to replace Red Jones, and Acuff had added guitarist Lonnie &quot;Pap&quot; Wilson and banjoist Rachel Veach to fill out the band&#x27;s lineup. Within a year, Roy Acuff and the Smoky Mountain Boys rivaled long-time Opry banjoist Uncle Dave Macon as the troupe&#x27;s most popular act.
In the same period, he was initiated to the Masonic Lodge of East Nashville No. 560.

In spring 1940, Acuff and his band traveled to Hollywood, where they appeared with Hay and Macon in the motion picture &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. Acuff appeared in several subsequent B movies, including &quot;O, My Darling Clementine&quot; (1943), in which he played a singing sheriff; &quot;Night Train to Memphis&quot; (1946), the title of which comes from a song Acuff recorded in 1940; and &quot;Home in San Antone&quot; (1949), in which he starred with Lloyd Corrigan and William Frawley.

Acuff and his band also joined Macon and other Opry acts at various tent shows held throughout the Southeast in the early 1940s. The crowds at these shows were so large that roads leading into the venues were jammed with traffic for miles. Starting in 1939, Acuff hosted the Opry&#x27;s &quot;Prince Albert&quot; segment. He left the show in 1946 after a dispute with management.

===Acuff-Rose===
In 1942, Acuff and songwriter Fred Rose (1897–1954) formed Acuff-Rose Music. Acuff originally sought the company to publish his own music, but soon realized that demand from other country artists existed, many of whom had been exploited by larger publishing firms. Due in large part to Rose&#x27;s ASCAP connections and gifted ability as a talent scout, Acuff-Rose quickly became the most important publishing company in country music. In 1946, the company signed Hank Williams, and in 1950, published their first major hit, Patti Page&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot;.
===Political ambitions===
In 1943, Acuff was initiated into the East Nashville Freemasonic Lodge in Tennessee, of which he would remain a lifelong member. Later that same year, Acuff invited Tennessee Governor Prentice Cooper to be the guest of honor at a gala held to mark the nationwide premiere of the Opry&#x27;s &quot;Prince Albert&quot; show. Cooper rejected the offer, however, and lambasted Acuff and his &quot;disgraceful&quot; music for making Tennessee the &quot;hillbilly capital of the United States.&quot; A Nashville journalist reported the governor&#x27;s comments to Acuff and suggested Acuff run for governor himself. While Acuff initially did not take the suggestion seriously, he did accept the Republican Party nomination for governor in 1948.

Acuff&#x27;s nomination caused great concern for E. H. Crump, the head of a Memphis Democratic Party political machine that had dominated Tennessee state politics for nearly a quarter-century. Crump was not worried so much about losing the governor&#x27;s office—in spite of Acuff&#x27;s name recognition—but did worry that Acuff would draw large crowds to Republican rallies and bolster other statewide candidates. While Acuff did relatively well and helped reinvigorate Tennessee&#x27;s Republicans, his opponent, Gordon Browning, still won with 67% of the vote.

===Later career===
After leaving the Opry, Acuff spent several years touring the Western United States, although demand for his appearances dwindled with the lack of national exposure and the rise of musicians such as Ernest Tubb and Eddy Arnold, who were more popular with younger audiences. He eventually returned to the Opry, although by the 1960s, his record sales had dropped off considerably. After nearly losing his life in an automobile accident outside of Sparta, Tennessee, in 1965, Acuff pondered retiring, making only token appearances on the Opry stage and similar shows, and occasionally performing duos with long-time bandmate Bashful Brother Oswald.

In 1972, Acuff&#x27;s career received a brief resurgence in the folk-revival movement after he appeared on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album, &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;. The appearance paved the way for one of the defining moments of Acuff&#x27;s career, which came on the night of March 16, 1974, when the Opry officially moved from the Ryman Auditorium to the Grand Ole Opry House at Opryland. The first show at the new venue opened with a huge projection of a late-1930s image of Roy Acuff and the Smoky Mountain Boys onto a large screen above the stage. A recording from one of the band&#x27;s 1939 appearances was played over the sound system, with the iconic voice of George Hay introducing the band, followed by the band&#x27;s performance of &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot;. That same night, Acuff showed President Richard Nixon, an honored guest at the event, how to yo-yo, and convinced the president to play several songs on the piano.

In the early 1980s, after the death of his wife, Mildred, Acuff, then in his 80s, moved into a small house on the Opryland grounds and continued performing daily on stage. He arrived early most days at the Opry before the shows and performed odd jobs, such as stocking soda in backstage refrigerators. He made a cameo appearance in the music video for Moe Bandy and Joe Stampley&#x27;s 1984 parody hit song &quot;Where&#x27;s The Dress?&quot; In 1988, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1991, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, and given a lifetime achievement award by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the first country music act to receive the esteemed honor.

==Death==

Roy Acuff died at the Baptist Hospital in Nashville on November 23, 1992, of congestive heart failure at the age of 89. He is buried in the Hillcrest section (grave 6, lot 9) of Spring Hill Cemetery on Gallatin Road in Nashville.

==Repertoire and legacy==
Many of Acuff&#x27;s songs show a strong Christian influence, most notably &quot;Great Speckled Bird&quot;, &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;, and &quot;Lord, Build Me a Cabin&quot;. Such songs were typically set to a traditional Anglo-Celtic melody, which is most apparent on &quot;Great Speckled Bird&quot; and the 1940 recording &quot;The Precious Jewel&quot;. Acuff performed popular songs of the day, including Pee Wee King&#x27;s &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; and Dorsey Dixon&#x27;s &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Hear Nobody Pray&quot;, the latter of which he appropriated and renamed &quot;Wreck on the Highway&quot;. He also recorded a version of the Cajun fiddler Harry Choates&#x27;s &quot;Jole Blon&quot;. Traditional recordings included &quot;Greenback Dollar&quot;, which he probably learned from Clarence Ashley while on the medicine-show circuit, and &quot;Lonesome Old River Blues&quot;, which he recorded with the Smoky Mountain Boys in the 1940s. Acuff and the Crazy Tennesseans recorded &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot;—another traditional song—in 1936, although Acuff did not provide the vocals on this early recording. The better-known version of the song with Acuff providing the vocals was recorded in 1947.

In 1979, Opryland opened the Roy Acuff Theatre, which was dedicated in Acuff&#x27;s honor (it was demolished in 2011 after suffering extensive damage in the 2010 Tennessee floods). Dunbar Cave State Natural Area was established in 1973 from a recreational area the state had purchased from Mrs. McKay King. The cave was owned by Acuff from 1948 to 1963. Two museums have been named in Acuff&#x27;s honor—the Roy Acuff Museum at Opryland (now closed) and the Roy Acuff Union Museum and Library in his hometown of Maynardville. Acuff has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 1541 Vine Street. He is pictured with other country singers at the new Smoky Mountain Opera in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.

<text>Michael John Bullard (June 12, 1957 – October 11, 2024) was a Canadian stand-up comic and broadcaster. He was the host of two late-night talk shows, &quot;Open Mike with Mike Bullard&quot; on CTV from 1997 to 2003 and &quot;The Mike Bullard Show&quot; on the Global Television Network from 2003 to 2004. From 2010 to 2016, he hosted &quot;Beyond the Mic with Mike Bullard&quot; weekdays at noon on Toronto radio station CFRB (Newstalk 1010).

==Early life==
Mike Bullard was born on June 12, 1957, in Etobicoke, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto to Jack and Ruby Bullard. His father was in retail and his mother was a housewife. His younger brother is US-based comedian, television writer, host, and producer Pat Bullard and his older half-brother is Downchild Blues Band lead singer Chuck Jackson. When Bullard was six, his family moved from Don Mills, Ontario, to Galt (now Cambridge, Ontario), later moving to Mississauga, where he attended Erindale Secondary School.

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy===
A resident of Mississauga since he was 14 years old, Bullard worked briefly as a police officer with Peel Regional Police in his youth, but resigned when he was not permitted to moonlight in comedy clubs. He then returned to Bell Canada, where he had worked previously, and eventually was promoted to associate director of corporate investigation, while also working part-time as a stand-up comic. His promotion occurred after his manager saw him perform as an emcee at the Just for Laughs festival, leading him to conclude that if Bullard could handle a crowd he could also handle corporate investigations.

Bullard had a long-time association with the Yuk Yuk&#x27;s chain of comedy clubs, as both an emcee and headliner, since first appearing at the Toronto club in July 1988. He started performing at the venue after being introduced to Yuk Yuk&#x27;s founder, Mark Breslin, by his brother, writer and comedian Pat Bullard. Bullard asked Breslin for spots emceeing shows at Yuk Yuk&#x27;s rather than as a headliner or a spot in the lineup in hopes of preparing himself to eventually become a talk show host.

He continued to perform at Yuk Yuk&#x27;s shows across Ontario until the end of his life. Yuk Yuk&#x27;s proprietor Mark Breslin, who knew Bullard for 35 years, said of him: &quot;He was probably the best emcee and host in the country. Nobody did crowd work like Mike. That was his real super strength.&quot;

===Television===
Bullard&#x27;s stand-up career led him to television in 1993 with a regular spot on &quot;Friday Night! with Ralph Benmergui&quot;, produced by Breslin, before becoming a late-night host in his own right as the host of &quot;Open Mike with Mike Bullard&quot; in 1997. The late-night talk variety show was considered the first successful Canadian attempt at the genre, following the previous failures of &quot;90 Minutes Live&quot; and &quot;Friday Night!&quot;. The show aired nightly for six seasons on The Comedy Network and the CTV Television Network and won two Gemini Awards during its run.

At its peak, &quot;Open Mike&quot; had higher Canadian ratings than &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. In 2003, Bullard&#x27;s contract with CTV was to expire. After CTV allegedly offered him only a one-year contract and limited control over the show - with longtime television critic Bill Brioux alleging that CTV had told him at one point that his show was to be cancelled, Bullard was hired away by Global with a multi-year deal to host &quot;The Mike Bullard Show&quot; in the same timeslot, with much of the same staff and sketches as &quot;Open Mike&quot;.

After leaving CTV, Bullard accused executives at his old network of not supporting the show and of being &quot;dysfunctional&quot;; in turn, they noted his &quot;bitterness&quot; after having &quot;burned his bridges&quot; with CTV and the Comedy Network.

The new show on Global was cancelled on March 12, 2004, after 13 weeks, due to poor ratings against &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, which CTV aired against it.

===Radio===
Following his television show&#x27;s cancellation, Bullard resumed his career as a stand-up comic playing in comedy clubs such as Yuk Yuk&#x27;s, released a comedy CD, did commercials for a weight loss clinic, and made a cameo appearance at the Gemini Awards taking part in a skit in which he played a corpse protesting &quot;I&#x27;m not dead yet!&quot; while paramedics removed him from the stage. In October 2006, Bullard launched an uncensored morning satellite radio show on XM Canada&#x27;s &quot;Laugh Attack&quot; channel; the program was cancelled after five months.

Bullard returned to television to host &quot;HouseCapades&quot;, a reality series which aired 250 episodes from 2005 to 2007, featuring people showcasing their homes for sale. In August 2009, he became the host of &quot;The Mike Bullard Show&quot; on Talk820 (CHAM) in Hamilton, Ontario; his evening show was cancelled when CHAM switched to a country music format in July 2010.

He hosted &quot;Beyond the Mic with Mike Bullard&quot; weekdays at noon on Newstalk 1010 (CFRB) in Toronto from 2010 until 2016 when he was terminated after being arrested for allegedly harassing his ex-girlfriend.

Bullard returned to broadcasting in October 2018 on Sauga 960 AM in Mississauga as host with Lawrence Morganstern of the afternoon drive time show, &quot;The Getaway&quot;. The show ceased production in late January 2019.

From 2019 to 2020, Bullard hosted a podcast, &quot;You Too with Mike Bullard&quot;.

==Humanitarian work in Ukraine==
In November 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Bullard went to Ukraine to volunteer with humanitarian organizations and document the impact of the crisis on civilians, remaining there until February 2023.

Bullard said he was haunted by one incident in Dnipro that he witnessed shortly after arriving, where Russian military hit an apartment block with missiles. While workers were digging through the rubble, two search dogs pinpointed one spot. After he and rescuers kept digging, the bodies of two children were pulled out from underneath the pieces of building.

&quot;They looked to be about maybe seven and five, and one of them had pyjamas on. They were both dead,&quot; Bullard told the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. &quot;I cried myself to sleep every night for a week.&quot;

In another incident, he helped clean out a house hit by ordnance that killed a man in his twenties. The pillow was bloodstained and had pieces of brain stuck to it. The man&#x27;s widow and mother-in-law moved back in after they finished.

Bullard decided to return to Canada, due to the high cost of medical care in Ukraine, after surviving an accident in which a car he was riding in was hit by a bus.

==Legal issues==
Bell Media, which owns CFRB, severed ties with Bullard on October 5, 2016, after he was charged with criminal harassment of his ex-girlfriend, Cynthia Mulligan. In 2017 and 2018, he was charged with several counts of allegedly breaching bail conditions and additional charges of obstructing justice for allegedly trying to get Mulligan to have the initial charges dropped.

On October 30, 2018, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; published a correction retracting an earlier report that Bullard had been spotted at Mulligan&#x27;s home in violation of a court order that he stay away from her. The newspaper&#x27;s correction stated &quot;In fact... the charges do not state that he was at her home and those allegations were not raised in any subsequent court proceedings. The criminal harassment charge against Bullard was dismissed at the preliminary inquiry on June 1, 2018.&quot;
On June 8, 2018, Bullard pleaded guilty to one count of harassing communication for making harassing phone calls to Mulligan and two counts of violating his bail conditions by contacting her through a third party. He was given a conditional discharge, put on six months of probation and was required to attend a domestic violence program. His criminal harassment and obstruction of justice charges had been dropped earlier in the month after the judge ruled there was no reasonable prospect of conviction.

Bullard launched a legal action for defamation in August 2018 against &quot;Chatelaine&quot; magazine, one of its writers, and its publisher, Rogers Media, asking for $6 million in damages after it published an interview with Cynthia Mulligan. The suit alleged the article incorrectly claimed that Bullard had been found guilty of &quot;stalking / criminal harassment&quot; and had resulted in Bullard being subjected &quot;to ridicule, hatred, and contempt&quot; and caused damage to his professional and personal reputations by implying that he is &quot;unfit for employment and/or intimate relationships&quot;.

On May 20, 2020, Bullard&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed by the court following a motion by the defence that the lawsuit violated Ontario&#x27;s anti-SLAPP legislation. Ontario Superior Court Justice Michael McKelvey ruled: &quot;What is clear in this case is that the damage to Mr. Bullard&#x27;s career and reputation occurred well prior to and independent of the publication of the &quot;Chatelaine&quot; article. What is also clear is that the comments of his victim are views one could honestly hold based on the proven facts, and form part of a public dialogue on a matter of significant public interest.&quot;

In 2022, Mitch Dubros, a private investigator who had been retained by Bullard&#x27;s lawyer, was found guilty of obstruction of justice for trying to threaten and intimidate witnesses and Mulligan in person and over the phone in what Superior Court Justice Kenneth Campbell said was &quot;a clear attempt to effectively blackmail Ms. Mulligan into staying silent in relation to the misconduct of Mr. Bullard.&quot; Dubros was sentenced to a jail term of 18 months. Bullard and Dubros both stated they didn&#x27;t know each other and had never met.

According to a 2023 &quot;Toronto Star&quot; profile, Bullard was unrepentant when talking about the case, speaking in a tense and stern tone &quot;sometimes drifting into anger&quot;, with Bullard asserting he was treated unfairly by the media, public and the prosecutors. Bullard said the case affected his career causing him to slide from public view, though he still worked regularly as a stand-up comic at Yuk Yuk&#x27;s.

==Death==
Bullard died in his sleep of a suspected heart attack on October 11, 2024, in Mississauga. He was 67. His body was found by a friend at the residence where he was staying.

==Awards==
Mike Bullard won two Gemini Awards for &quot;Open Mike With Mike Bullard&quot;, Best Talk Information Series in 1999 and Best Music Variety Program Series in 2001. The show also won the 2000 Hugo Award (Gold Medal) for Best Talk Show at the Chicago International Television Festival. Bullard was voted one of the top 10 Funniest Canadians in a nationwide poll by &quot;TV Guide&quot; in 2002.

In 2013, he received the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Medal for his volunteer work, including supporting charities such as the Trillium Health Foundation and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and emceeing many charitable fundraisers.

<text>Benjamin Hawkins (August 15, 1754June 6, 1816) was an American planter, statesman and a U.S. Indian agent. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress and a United States Senator from North Carolina, having grown up among the planter elite. Appointed by George Washington in 1796 as one of three commissioners to the Creeks, in 1801 President Jefferson named him &quot;principal agent for Indian affairs south of the Ohio [River]&quot;, and was principal Indian agent to the Creek Indians.

Hawkins established the Creek Agency and his plantation near present-day Roberta, Georgia, in what became Crawford County. He learned the Muscogee language, and had a Creek woman, Lavinia Downs, as common-law wife, who, in the Creek&#x27;s matrilineal society, provided an entry into that world. He had seven children with her, although he resisted Creek pressure to marry her until near the end of his life. He wrote extensively about the Creek and other Southeast tribes: the Choctaw, Cherokee and Chickasaw. He eventually built a large complex using African slave labor, including mills, and raised a considerable quantity of cattle and hogs.

==Early life and education==

Benjamin Hawkins was born to Philemon Hawkins and Delia (Martin) Hawkins on August 15, 1754, the third of four sons. The family owned a slave plantation in what was then Granville County, North Carolina, but is now Warren County. He attended the county schools, then at the College of New Jersey (later to become Princeton University). He was &quot;apt at multiple languages&quot;, a linguistic competence that would later enable him to learn Indian languages. When the College (which he never graduated from) temporarily closed due to the outbreak of war, Hawkins was commissioned a Colonel and served for several years on George Washington&#x27;s staff as his main interpreter of French.

==Career==
Hawkins was released from federal service late in 1777, as Washington learned to rely on Lafayette for dealing with the French. He returned home, where he was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1778. He served there until 1779, and again in 1784. The North Carolina General Assembly sent him to the Continental Congress as their delegate from 1781 to 1783, and again in 1787.

In 1789, Hawkins was a delegate to the Fayetteville Convention that ratified the United States Constitution. He was elected to the first U.S. Senate, where he served from 1789 to 1795. Although the Senate did not have organized political parties at the time, Hawkins&#x27; views aligned with different groups. Early in his Senate career, he was counted in the ranks of those senators viewed as pro-Administration, but by the third congress, he generally sided with senators of the Republican or Anti-Administration Party.

===U.S. Indian agent===
In 1785, Hawkins had served as a representative for the Congress in negotiations over land with the Creek Indians of the Southeast. He was generally successful, and convinced the tribe to lessen their raids for several years, although he could not conclude a formal treaty. The Creek wanted to deal with the &#x27;head man&#x27;. They finally signed the Treaty of New York (1790) after Hawkins convinced George Washington to become involved.

In 1786, Hawkins and fellow Indian agents Andrew Pickens and Joseph Martin concluded a treaty with the Choctaw nation at Seneca Old Town, also known as Hopewell, the plantation of Andrew Pickens, near Clemson, South Carolina. They set out the boundaries for the Choctaw lands as well as provisions for relations between the tribe and the U.S. government.

In 1789, conditions among the Creeks seemed to indicate an urgency for his return to the Creek country. Accordingly, he left Tennessee early in September for Fort Wilkinson on the Oconee River in Georgia. The next few months were spent with the Creeks. January 1, 1789, was set as the date for the assembling of the commissioners for running the Creek line in conformity to the treaties at New York and Coleraine. Hawkins had some difficulty in persuading the Creeks to agree to the running of the line, as many of the younger warriors were opposed. On February 16 Hawkins reported to Secretary of War, James McHenry that the line had been run from the Tugalo River over Currahee Mountain to the main south branch of the Oconee River. Though about sixteen families of Georgians were found on the Creek lands in the area known as Wofford&#x27;s Settlement, McHenry was told &quot;...I am happy in being able to assure you that there was no diversity of opinion among us, and that the line was closed in perfect harmony.&quot; This line became known as the Hawkins Line.

In 1796, Washington appointed Benjamin Hawkins as General Superintendent of Indian Affairs, dealing with all tribes south of the Ohio River. As principal agent to the Creek tribe, Hawkins soon moved to present-day Crawford County in Georgia where he established his home and the Creek Agency. He studied the language and was adopted by the Creek. He wrote extensively about them and the other southeast tribes.

===Georgia===
Hawkins&#x27; plans for the Indians was a &quot;civilization plan&quot;, by which he meant adopting the European-American lifestyle, raising crops and animals on farms. He began to teach European-American agricultural practices to the Creek, and started a farm at his and Lavinia&#x27;s home on the Flint River. He brought his enslaved Black workers from North Carolina, and eventually purchased others. He hired other workers to assist them in clearing several hundred acres for his plantation. They built a sawmill, gristmill, and a trading post for the agency. Hawkins expanded his operation to include more than 1,000 head of cattle and a large number of hogs, and raised &quot;immense crops&quot; of corn and other provisions. For years, he met with chiefs on his porch and discussed matters there. His personal hard work and open-handed generosity won him such respect that reports say that he never lost an animal to Indian raiders. He became a respected and trusted man among the community, and bore the title as “The Beloved Man of the Four Nations.” Cherokee women told Hawkins &quot;that, of the several Indian agents who visited them, he was the first who thought it worth while to examine into the situation of the women&quot;.

He contributed to the 19 years of peace between settlers and the tribe, the longest such period during European-American settlement. When in 1806 the government built a fort at the fall line of the Ocmulgee River, to protect expanding settlements just east of modern Macon, Georgia, the government named it Fort Benjamin Hawkins in his honor.

Hawkins saw much of his work to preserve peace destroyed in 1812. A group of Creek rebels, known as Red Sticks, were working to revive traditional ways and halt encroachment by European Americans. The ensuing civil war among the Creeks coincided with the War of 1812.

During the Creek War of 1813-1814, Hawkins organized &quot;friendly&quot; Creek Indians under the command of chief William McIntosh to aid Georgia and Tennessee militias in their forays against the traditionalist Red Sticks. General Andrew Jackson led the defeat of the Red Sticks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, in present-day Alabama. Hawkins was unable to attend negotiations of the Treaty of Fort Jackson in August 1814, which required the Creeks to cede most of their territory and give up their way of life. Hawkins later organized &quot;friendly&quot; Creek warriors to oppose a British force on the Apalachicola River that threatened to rally the scattered Red Sticks and reignite the war on the Georgia frontier. After the British withdrew in 1815, Hawkins was organizing another force when he died of a sudden illness on June 6, 1816.

Hawkins tried more than once to resign his post and return from the Georgia frontier, but no President would accept his resignation. (Dale Cox says that President Monroe accepted his resignation, but Hawkins died before Monroe became president.) He remained Superintendent until his death. Near the end of his life, he formally married Lavinia Downs in a European-American ceremony, making their children legitimate in United States society. They already belonged to Downs&#x27; clan among the Creek, who had a matrilineal kinship system. The children gained status from their mother&#x27;s clan and people, and their mother&#x27;s eldest brother was usually more important in their lives than their biological father.

Benjamin Hawkins was buried at the Creek Agency near the Flint River and Roberta, Georgia. He was succeeded as Indian agent by David Mitchell, former Governor of Georgia.

Fort Hawkins was built overlooking the ancient site since designated as the Ocmulgee National Monument. Revealing 17,000 years of human habitation, it is a National Historic Landmark and has been sacred for centuries to the Creek. It has massive earthwork mounds built nearly 1,000 years ago as expressions of the religious and political world of the Mississippian culture, the ancestors to the Creek.

==Hawkins and slavery==
Hawkins&#x27; plantation was farmed by enslaved labor, but beyond that his unhappy record on slavery has been overlooked. He transformed the Creek Agency and Fort Hawkins into holding stations for fugitive slaves, and paid Indians $50 () for every fugitive delivered there. (He expected to be reimbursed by their owners.) Captured Blacks that did not have an owner, he told the Creeks to keep; i.e., he encouraged slavery among the Creeks.

It was Hawkins who first used the term negro fort to refer to the British Post on the Apalachicola River, at that time in Spanish Florida. Hawkins started the call for its capture or destruction.

==Personal life==
He married Susan Lavinia Downs, who some believe was a Creek Indian woman (the Creeks wanted him to take a Creek wife), whereas other evidence indicates that she was a white woman. They had a total of six daughters: Georgia, Muscogee, Cherokee, Carolina, Virginia, and Jeffersonia, and one son, James Madison Hawkins. In 1812, thinking he was on his death bed, Hawkins remarried his wife Susan Lavinia Downs to make sure their children were legitimate in U.S. society. Jeffersonia was born after this marriage.

Hawkins was close to his nephew William Hawkins, whom he made a co-executor of his estate along with his wife; he bequeathed to William a share of his estate, reputed to be quite large. This bequest became a source of contention among his heirs, especially as he had not altered his will to include his youngest daughter Jeffersonia.

<text>Grover Aloysius Whalen (1886–1962) was a prominent politician, businessman, and public relations guru in New York City during the 1930s and 1940s.

==Early years==
Whalen was born on July 2, 1886, in New York City, the son of an Irish immigrant father and a French-Canadian mother. They named their son after President Grover Cleveland, who was married on the same day that their child was born. His father, Michael Whalen, was a successful trucking contractor and a Tammany Hall supporter.

Grover Whalen attended DeWitt Clinton High School and afterwards studied law. He then joined the staff of John Wanamaker&#x27;s department store, with which he would long be associated. He married Anna Dolores Kelly in 1913.

Whalen ran his father&#x27;s ash and garbage disposal business for a time before becoming involved in politics, working for the election of John F. Hylan as Mayor of New York.

==Political appointments==
After Hylan became Mayor in 1918, Whalen was appointed to be Commissioner of Plants and Structures. In this position he supervised the city&#x27;s transportation system. He also served as Hylan&#x27;s Commissioner of Purchase and took part in greeting ceremonies, including the welcome of General John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces, in 1919. In 1922, he proposed the creation of a radio station owned and operated by the city, a plan that came to fruition with the first broadcast of WNYC in 1924.

In 1924, Whalen left the Hylan administration to assist Rodman Wanamaker in the operation of the Wanamaker department stores, serving as general manager. Wanamaker named him Vice President of Operations for the American Trans-Oceanic Company, a new airline flying Curtiss seaplanes between New York and Florida.

==Police Commissioner==
In 1928, he returned to civic life when he was appointed by Mayor Jimmy Walker to the position of New York City Police Commissioner. He was known to be a ruthless enforcer of Prohibition laws. Whalen was famously quoted as saying, &quot;There is plenty of law at the end of a nightstick.&quot;

Whalen came under fire for police handling of the International Unemployment Day demonstration on March 6, 1930, in New York City, in which an impromptu march of 35,000 or more demonstrators down Broadway to New York City Hall was set upon by 1,000 baton-wielding police.

The brutal scene was described by a reporter from the &quot;New York Times:&quot;
Hundreds of policemen and detectives, swinging nightsticks, blackjacks, and bare fists, rushed into the crowd, hitting out at all with whom they came into contact, chasing many across the street and into adjacent thoroughfares and pushing hundreds off their feet. From all parts of the scene of battle came the screams of women and cries of men with bloody heads and faces.

Sharply criticized for the escalation of violence by the police, Whalen was forced to resign his post within two months.

==Later career==
He was later appointed by Fiorello La Guardia as Chairman of the Mayor&#x27;s Committee on Receptions to Distinguished Guests, succeeding William Francis Deegan, and became a public celebrity easily recognized by his exquisitely groomed moustache and carnation boutonniere. In this capacity, in which he served until the early 1950s, he officially welcomed everyone from Charles Lindbergh to Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd to Douglas MacArthur to New York and became master of the ticker tape parade.

In 1933, Whelan received The Hundred Year Association of New York&#x27;s Gold Medal Award &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.&quot; In 1935, he became president of the New York World Fair Corporation and put a familiar face on the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. He was on the cover of Time magazine on May 1, 1939.

===Mr. New York===
Whalen was known as the official greeter and organizer of many public events and celebrations taking place in New York during the first half of the 20th century. G.P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons, the publisher of Whalen&#x27;s autobiography, came up with &quot;Mr. New York&quot; as the title of his autobiography. 

In the acknowledgements before beginning his autobiography, Whalen gives credit to the late Melville Minton, President of G.P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons, for encouraging him to write a book about New York. During an interview with the New Yorker in November 1955, Whalen claims that Minton asked him to write a book about New York during the 1920s. The publishing company provided Whalen with a staff of researchers responsible for validating stories and facts incorporated into the autobiography. Ted Purdy, the man in charge of editing Whalen&#x27;s writing, took the 800 pages penned by Whalen and condensed it into a 300-page collection of personal accounts. Purdy and his team also provided the Mr. New York title for the collection of stories written by Whalen.

The bulk of his writing describes planning and execution of receptions, ceremonies, and civic projects under his direction. He provides vivid imagery and background information regarding specific events such as ticker-tape parades for American heroes like Lindbergh after the completion of his flight across the Atlantic Ocean from New York to Paris in 1927. Whalen also goes into great detail about the planning and intricacies behind the parades for returning World War II soldiers, most notably General Dwight D. Eisenhower in June 1945. Although Whalen claims that he wrote extensively about those accounts because he thought his readers would find them most interesting, he left out the fact of political corruption. Throughout his writings, he often refers to the advantages of political ambition under the wing of Tammany Hall. However, he never admits to any moral wrongdoing of the political machine. Also, after the stock market crashed in 1929, Frank Costello was recorded telling Lucky Luciano that he had to advance Whalen $30,000 to cover his margin calls on the market. A few seconds later he said, &quot;What could I do? We own him.&quot;

In the beginning and ending chapters of the autobiography, Whalen provides valuable insight on the many things he values and loves about his city. In the first few chapters, Whalen writes with a nostalgic pen recollecting memories of the family culture of the close-knit neighborhood he grew up in on the Lower East Side.

Also, in the last chapter he concludes by describing his fascination with New York, using the trajectory of his professional career as evidence of the proposed American dream: &quot;New York means to me a place where anyone can still rise to the top, no matter how humble his beginnings.&quot;

===Death and legacy===
He died at the age of 75 on April 20, 1962.

He is mentioned in the Harold Arlen/Yip Harburg song &quot;Lydia the Tattooed Lady&quot; (&quot;Here is Grover Whalen, unveilin&#x27; the Trilon...&quot;), the Cole Porter song &quot;Let&#x27;s Fly Away&quot;, and the Bobby Short song &quot;Sweet Bye and Bye&quot; as well as in the 1933 film &quot;The Prizefighter and the Lady&quot;, starring Myrna Loy and Max Baer. Grover Whalen is also mentioned in &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;, a play written by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman in 1930. He is also mentioned in E.B. White&#x27;s essay &quot;The World of Tomorrow.&quot; In P.G. Wodehouse&#x27;s 1940 novel Quick Service, the character J.B. Duff&#x27;s false moustache is compared disparagingly to that of Grover Whalen. Johnny Mandel&#x27;s 1955 jazz tune &quot;Groover Wailin&#x27;&quot; is a pun on Whalen&#x27;s name. A character in Gregory Mcdonald&#x27;s &quot;Flynn&quot; novels (published between 1976 and 1999) is Sgt. Richard Whalen, who is consistently addressed by the mischievous Flynn as &quot;Grover&quot;. Whalen has no idea why Flynn does this, and finds it annoying.

Debates, exhibitions, tours and networking events make the UIA Congresses the perfect meeting place for experts, colleagues, friends, and students of architecture.

UIA Congresses are organised by a host UIA Member Section. Congress bids are submitted to the UIA General Assembly and selected by vote six years in advance of the event.

List of congresses from 1948 to 2026
== World Capital of Architecture == 
On 23 November 2018, the UIA published a Memorandum of Understanding with UNESCO on the new joint label World Capital of Architecture. The title is awarded every three years, according to the rhythm of the UIA World Congresses. Since 2020, the world congress has always taken place in the respective world capital. There is a formal application process for this. The World Congress selects the World Capital for the year of the next World Congress from the shortlist of applications, the formal announcement being made by the Secretary General of UNESCO. In 2020 Rio de Janeiro was the world capital of architecture, 2023 Copenhagen and 2026 Barcelona.

<doc id="486610" wikidata="Q183105" url="?curid=486610" title="Randolph Churchill">
<text>Major Randolph Frederick Edward Spencer Churchill (28 May 1911 – 6 June 1968) was an English journalist, writer and politician.

The only son of future British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his wife, Clementine, Randolph was brought up to regard himself as his father&#x27;s political heir, although their relations became strained in later years. In the 1930s, he stood unsuccessfully for Parliament a number of times, causing his father embarrassment. He was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Preston at the 1940 Preston by-election. During the Second World War, he served with the SAS in North Africa and with Tito&#x27;s partisans in Yugoslavia. Randolph lost his seat in 1945 and was never re-elected to Parliament. Despite his lack of success in politics, Randolph enjoyed a successful career as a writer and journalist. In the 1960s, he wrote the first two volumes of the official life of his father.

Randolph was married and divorced twice. His first wife was Pamela Digby (later Harriman); their son Winston later became a Conservative MP. Throughout his life, Randolph had a reputation for rude, drunken behaviour. By the 1960s, his health had collapsed from years of heavy drinking; he outlived his father by only three years.

==Childhood==
Randolph Churchill was born at his parents&#x27; house at Eccleston Square, London, on 28 May 1911. His parents nicknamed him &quot;the Chumbolly&quot; before he was born.

His father Winston Churchill was already a leading Liberal Cabinet Minister, and Randolph was christened in the House of Commons crypt on 26 October 1911, with Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey and Conservative politician F. E. Smith among his godparents. Randolph and his older sister Diana had for a time to be escorted by plain clothes detectives on their walks in the park, because of threats by suffragettes to kidnap them. He was a page at the marriage of the Prime Minister&#x27;s daughter Violet Asquith to Maurice Bonham Carter on 1 December 1915.

He recalled the Zeppelin raids of 1917 as &quot;a great treat&quot;, as the children were taken from their beds in the middle of the night, wrapped in blankets, and &quot;allowed&quot; to join the grown-ups in the cellar; he also recalled the Armistice celebrations at Blenheim Palace.

He went to Sandroyd School in Wiltshire, and later admitted that he had had a problem with authority and discipline. His headmaster reported to his father that he was &quot;very combative&quot;. Winston, who had been neglected by his parents as a small boy, visited his son at prep school as often as possible. Randolph was very good-looking as a child and into his twenties. In his autobiography &quot;Twenty-One Years&quot; (pp. 24–25) he recorded that at the age of ten he had been &quot;interfered with&quot; by a junior prep school master, who made Randolph touch him sexually, only to leap embarrassed to his feet when a matron came in. At home, a maid overheard Randolph confiding in his sister Diana. He later wrote that he had never seen his father so angry, and that he had made a hundred-mile trip to demand that the teacher be dismissed, only to learn that the teacher had already been sacked.

He remembered that he and Diana returned from ice-skating in Holland Park on 22 June 1922 to find the house guarded and being searched by &quot;tough-looking men&quot; following the assassination of Field Marshal Henry Wilson.

Winston gave his son a choice of Eton College or Harrow School, and he chose the former. Randolph later wrote &quot;I was lazy and unsuccessful both at work and at games ... and was an unpopular boy&quot;. He was once said to have been given &quot;six up&quot; (i.e. a beating) by his house&#x27;s Captain of Games (a senior boy) for being &quot;bloody awful all round&quot;. Michael Foot later wrote that this was &quot;the kind of comprehensive verdict which others who had dealings with him were always searching for.&quot; He once wrote apologising to his father for &quot;having done so badly and disappointed you so much&quot;. During the general strike of 1926 he fixed up a secret radio set as his housemaster would not allow him to have one. In November 1926 his headmaster wrote to his father to inform him that he had caned Randolph, then aged 15, after all five of the masters then teaching him had independently reported him for &quot;either being idle or being a bore with his chatter&quot;.

As a teenager Randolph fell in love with Diana Mitford, sister of his friend Tom Mitford. Tom Mitford was regarded as having a calming influence on him, although his housemaster Colonel Sheepshanks wrongly suspected Randolph and Tom of being lovers; Randolph replied, &quot;I happen to be in love with his sister&quot;.

Randolph was &quot;a loquacious and precocious boy&quot;. From his teenage years he was encouraged to attend his father&#x27;s dinner parties with leading politicians of the day, drink and have his say, and he later recorded that he would simply have laughed at anyone who had suggested that he would &quot;not&quot; go straight into politics and perhaps even become prime minister by his mid-twenties like William Pitt the Younger. His sister later wrote that he &quot;manifestly needed a father&#x27;s hand&quot; but his father &quot;spoiled and indulged him&quot;, and did not take seriously the complaints of his schoolmasters. He was influenced by his godfather Lord Birkenhead (F. E. Smith), an opinionated and heavy-drinking man. Winston Churchill was Chancellor of the Exchequer from late 1924 until 1929. Busy in that office, he neglected his daughters in favour of Randolph, who was his only son. On a visit to Italy in 1927 Winston and Randolph were received by Pope Pius XI. In later life &quot;relations between Winston and Randolph were always uneasy, the father alternately spoiling and being infuriated by the son.&quot;

In April 1928 Winston forwarded a satisfactory school report to Clementine, who was in Florence, commenting that Randolph was &quot;developing fast&quot; and would be fit for politics, the bar or journalism and was &quot;far more advanced than I was at his age&quot;. His mother replied that &quot;He is certainly going to be an interest, an anxiety &amp; an excitement in our lives&quot;. He had cool relations with his mother from an early age, in part because she felt him to be spoiled and arrogant as a result of his father&#x27;s overindulgence. Clementine&#x27;s biographer writes that &quot;Randolph was for decades a recurrent embarrassment to both his parents&quot;.

In what would turn out to be his final report on leaving Eton, Robert Birley, one of his history teachers, wrote of his native intelligence and writing ability, but added that he found it too easy to get by on little work or with a journalist&#x27;s knack of spinning a single idea into an essay.

==Oxford==
Randolph went up to Christ Church, Oxford, in January 1929, partway through the academic year and not yet eighteen, after his father&#x27;s friend Professor Lindemann had advised that a place had fallen vacant.

In May he spoke for his father at the May 1929 general election. Between August and October 1929 Randolph and his uncle accompanied his father (now out of office) on his lecture tour of the US and Canada. His diary of the trip was later included in &quot;Twenty-One Years&quot;. On one occasion he impressed his father by delivering an impromptu five-minute reply to a tedious speech by a local cleric. At San Simeon (the mansion of press baron Randolph Hearst) he lost his virginity to the Austrian-born actress Tilly Losch, an erstwhile lover of his close friend Tom Mitford.

Randolph was already drinking double brandies at the age of nineteen, to his parents&#x27; consternation. He did little work or sport at Oxford and spent most of his time at lengthy lunch and dinner parties with other well-connected undergraduates and with dons who enjoyed being entertained by them. Randolph later claimed that he had benefited from the experience, but at the time his lifestyle earned him a magisterial letter of rebuke from his father (29 December 1929), warning him that he was &quot;not acquiring any habits of industry or concentration&quot; and that he would withdraw him from Oxford if he did not focus on his studies. Winston Churchill had also received a similar and oft-quoted letter of rebuke from his own father, Lord Randolph Churchill, at almost exactly the same age.

==Speaking tour of the United States==
Randolph dropped out of Oxford in October 1930 to conduct a lecture tour of the US. He was already in debt; his mother guessed correctly that he would never finish his degree. Contrary to his later claims, his father attempted to dissuade him at the time.

Unlike his father, who had become a powerful orator through much practice, and whose speeches always required extensive preparation, public speaking came easily to Randolph. His son later recorded that this was a mixed blessing: &quot;because of the very facility with which he could speak extemporaneously [he] failed to make the effort required to bring him more success&quot;.

Randolph very nearly married Kay Halle of Cleveland, Ohio, seven years his senior. His father wrote begging him not to be so foolish as to marry before he had established a career. Clementine visited him in December, using money Winston had given her to buy a small car. Contrary to newspaper reports that she had crossed the Atlantic to put a stop to the wedding, she only learned of the engagement when she arrived. She found Randolph, to her horror, living in an extravagant suite of hotel rooms, but was able to write to Miss Halle&#x27;s father, who agreed that it would be unwise for their children to marry.

Clementine wrote to her husband of one of Randolph&#x27;s lectures &quot;Frankly, it was not at &quot;all&quot; good&quot; and commented that he should have had it well-practised by now, although she was impressed by his delivery. She went home in April 1931, having enjoyed Randolph&#x27;s company in New York. She would later look back on the trip with nostalgia.

Randolph&#x27;s lecture tour earned him $12,000 (£2,500 at the then rate of exchange, roughly £150,000 at 2020 prices). By the time of his mother&#x27;s arrival he had already spent £1,000 in three months, despite being on a £400 annual parental allowance. He left the US owing $2,000 to his father&#x27;s friend, the financier Bernard Baruch; a debt which he did not repay for thirty years.

==Early 1930s==
In October 1931 Randolph began a lecture tour of the UK. He lost £600 by betting wrongly on the results of the general election; his father paid his debts on condition he gave up his chauffeur-driven Bentley, a more extravagant car than his father drove. In 1931 he shared Edward James&#x27;s house in London with John Betjeman. By the early 1930s Randolph was working as a journalist for the Rothermere press. He wrote in an article in 1932 that he planned to &quot;make an immense fortune and become Prime Minister&quot;. He warned that the Nazis meant war as early as March 1932 in his &quot;Daily Graphic&quot; column; his son Winston later claimed that he was the first British journalist to warn about Hitler.

In 1932 Winston Churchill had Philip Laszlo paint an idealised portrait of his son for his 21st birthday. Winston Churchill organised a &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; dinner at Claridge&#x27;s for his birthday on 16 June 1932, with Lord Hailsham and his son Quintin Hogg, Lord Cranborne and Freddie Birkenhead, the son of Winston&#x27;s late friend F. E. Smith. Also present were Admiral of the Fleet Earl Beatty and his son, and Oswald Mosley (then still seen as a coming man). That year Randolph flew into a rage with Lord Beaverbrook, when his &quot;Daily Express&quot; singled him out in a story on the sons of great men, which sneered that &quot;major fathers as a rule breed minor sons, so our little London peacocks had better tone down their fine feathers.&quot; &quot;The function of the gossip writer&quot;, said Randolph, &quot;is not among those which commend themselves mostly highly to my generation&quot; (in middle age Randolph would himself become a highly paid London gossip columnist).

Randolph reported from the German elections in July 1932. Randolph encouraged his father to try to meet Adolf Hitler in summer 1932 whilst he was retracing the Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s march to Blenheim (Winston was writing the Duke&#x27;s life at the time); the meeting fell through at the last minute as Hitler excused himself. Randolph had an affair with Doris Castlerosse in 1932, causing a near fight with her husband. She later claimed to have had an affair with his father Winston in the mid-1930s, although Winston&#x27;s biographer Andrew Roberts believes the latter claim unlikely to be true.

Randolph, then aged just 21, was sent to Paraguay in August 1932 by Beaverbrook&#x27;s &quot;Daily Express&quot;. Just after his arrival in Asunción, he conducted an interview with Major Arturo Bray Riquelme, Director of the Military School and Commander of the R.I. 6 &quot;Boquerón&quot;, formed from the officers and cadets of the Paraguayan Military School; this report was published in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; on Thursday, 11 August 1932, when the R.I. 6 was in full preparation to depart or at the war front in the Chaco. Arturo Bray was highly requested by the British Press, as the English knew that Bray was a British officer, hero of World War I, awarded with the highest medals of bravery bestowed by Britain and France.

At Lady Diana Cooper&#x27;s fortieth birthday party in Venice that year a woman was deliberately burned on her hand with a cigarette by a thwarted lover, and Randolph sprang to her defence.

Randolph also became embroiled in the controversy of the February 1933 King and Country debate at the Oxford Union Society. Three weeks after the Union had passed a pacifist motion, Randolph and his friend Lord Stanley proposed a resolution to delete the previous motion from the Union&#x27;s records. After a poor speech from Stanley, the president, Frank Hardie, temporarily handed over the chair to the librarian and opposed the motion on behalf of the Union, a very unusual move. The minutes record that he received &quot;a very remarkable ovation&quot;. Randolph was then met by a barrage of hisses and stink bombs. His speech, facing what the minutes describe as a &quot;very antipathetic and even angry house&quot; was &quot;unfortunate in his manner and phrasing&quot; and was met with &quot;delighted jeers&quot;. He then attempted to withdraw the motion. Hardie was willing to permit this, but an ex-president pointed out from the floor that a vote of the whole house was required to allow a motion to be withdrawn. The request to withdraw was defeated by acclamation and the motion was then defeated by 750 votes to 138 (a far better attendance than the original debate had attained). Randolph had persuaded a number of other former students, life members of the Union, to attend in the hope of carrying his motion. A bodyguard of Oxford Conservatives and police escorted Churchill back to his hotel after the debate. Sir Edward Heath recorded in his memoirs that after the debate some of the undergraduates had been intent on debagging him. Winston Churchill wrote praising his son&#x27;s courage in addressing a large, hostile audience, adding that &quot;he was by no means cowed&quot;.

Randolph&#x27;s good looks and self-confidence soon brought him some success as a womaniser, but his attempt to seduce one young woman at Blenheim failed after she spent the night in bed for protection with his cousin Anita Leslie, while Randolph sat on the side of the bed talking at length of &quot;when I am prime minister&quot;. Randolph, who had been lucky not to be named in court as one of her lovers, also comforted a tearful Tilly Losch in public at Quaglino&#x27;s after her divorce in 1934, to the amusement of the other diners and the waiters.

In the 1930s, Winston&#x27;s overindulgence of his son was one of several causes of coolness between him and Clementine. Clementine several times threw him out of Chartwell after arguments; at one time Clementine told Randolph she hated him and never wanted to see him again.

==Early political career==
Randolph Churchill&#x27;s political career (like that of his son) was not as successful as that of his father or grandfather Lord Randolph Churchill. In an attempt to assert his own political standing he announced in January 1935 that he was a candidate in the Wavertree by-election in Liverpool; on 6 February 1935, an Independent Conservative on a platform of rearmament and opposition to Indian Home Rule. His campaign was funded by Lucy, Lady Houston, an eccentric ardent nationalist who owned the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. In an attempt to encourage Randolph, Lady Houston sent him a poem:

&lt;poem&gt;
 When the truth is told at Wavertree
 Wavertree will set India free
 And Socialist Mac will be up a tree
 With all his lies and hypocrisy
 Your Indian kinsfolk from over the sea
 Are crying to thee
 To save them from horrors you cannot see
 Gallant Randolph can set them free
 For Randolph is brave and Randolph has youth
 And is boldly determined to tell the truth
 Pitt was premier at twenty three
 So why not he?
&lt;/poem&gt;

The poem was widely disseminated in the press – but without the unflattering references to &#x27;Socialist Mac[Donald],&#x27; who at the time was still Prime Minister of the Conservative-dominated National Government.

His involvement was criticised by his father for splitting the official Conservative vote and letting in a winning Labour candidate, although Winston appeared to support Randolph on the hustings. Michael Foot was an eyewitness at Wavertree, where he blamed Baldwin&#x27;s India policy (allowing India to impose tariffs on imported British goods) for hurting the Lancashire cotton trade. When he asked rhetorically, &quot;And who is responsible for putting Liverpool where she is today?&quot; a heckler shouted, &quot;Blackburn Rovers!&quot;. &quot;He collected 10,000 Independent votes in a few days and handed the seat on a platter to the Labour Party&quot; as Foot later put it. The day after the Wavertree by-election the Secretary of State for India Samuel Hoare wrote to Viceroy Lord Willingdon “that little brute Randolph has done a lot of mischief … The fact that he kept our man out will undoubtedly do both Winston and him a good deal of harm in the party. The fact, however, that he got more votes than we expected is disquieting. It shows that there is a great deal of inflammable material about and it makes me nervous of future explosions.”

In March 1935, again with financial backing from Lady Houston, he sponsored an Independent Conservative candidate, Richard Findlay, also a member of the British Union of Fascists, to stand in a by-election in Norwood. This attracted no backing from MPs or the press, and Findlay lost to the official Conservative candidate, Duncan Sandys, who in September that year became Randolph&#x27;s brother-in-law, marrying his sister Diana. He had a violent row with his father about Norwood; Winston did not support him in any way this time, although he was suspected by other Conservatives of having done so. Duncan Sandys was the only one of Randolph&#x27;s Conservative opponents to win; Randolph soon became jealous when Sandys joined the family and Churchill warmed to him.

Having blamed Baldwin and the party organization for his loss, Randolph libelled Sir Thomas White. Over the summer he was summoned to the High Court to pay damages of £1,000; when advised that without an apology his career in politics was over, he immediately backtracked.

Randolph Churchill was an effective manipulator of the media, using his family name to obtain coverage in newspapers such as the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. In the November 1935 general election he stood as the official Conservative candidate at Labour-held West Toxteth; reportedly he was so unwelcome that they threw bananas. The Earl of Derby lent his support, and Randolph continued to aid the Conservative campaigning across the city. He stood for Parliament a third time, as a Unionist on 10 February 1936 in a by-election at Ross and Cromarty, opposed to the National Government candidacy of Malcolm MacDonald. Randolph&#x27;s campaign was funded by Lady Houston for a third time. It was long and lively, carried out in wintry conditions in which Randolph and the other candidates drove many miles over narrow mountain tracks, carrying spades in their cars to dig themselves out of snowdrifts, to reach far areas of the large constituency. Although Randolph enjoyed it all enormously, he was defeated again. This embarrassed his father, who was hoping to be offered a Cabinet position at this time.

In September 1936, at his father&#x27;s behest, Randolph pursued his younger sister Sarah to the US in a vain attempt to dissuade her from marrying the much older comedian Vic Oliver.

Lady Houston had backed Randolph&#x27;s three attempts to stand for Parliament. He was better backed financially than his father had ever been. This support came to a halt when she died late in 1936. Freddie Birkenhead remarked that he was &quot;unbowed but bloody as usual&quot;. Thereafter he used his employment as a Beaverbrook/Rothermere journalist to promote his political career and to warn of the dangers of Hitler. In 1937 he tried in vain to get an invitation from Unity Mitford to meet Hitler. The diarist &quot;Chips&quot; Channon speculated (15 April) that if Winston Churchill were to return to office under the new Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain the outcome might be &quot;an explosion of foolishness after a short time&quot;, war with Germany or even &quot;a seat for Randolph&quot;. Churchill warned the House of Commons (19 July 1937) that there were twelve-inch Spanish howitzers trained on Gibraltar. Channon recorded that this reduced the House&#x27;s sympathies for Franco, but that when the House learned that the source was &quot;Master Randolph&quot; (as he described him) MPs were merely amused.

Virginia Cowles first met Randolph in New York in the early 1930s. He helped her to get a visa to report from the USSR in February 1939. She praised his courage but wrote that &quot;going out with him was like going out with a time bomb. Wherever he went an explosion seemed to follow. With a natural and brilliant gift of oratory, and a disregard for the opinions of his elders, he often held dinner parties pinned in a helpless and angry silence. I never knew a young man who had the ability to antagonise so easily.&quot; At a dinner at Blenheim for Lady Sarah Spencer-Churchill&#x27;s 18th birthday in July 1939 a drunk Randolph had to be removed after behaving badly to a woman who spurned his advances and starting a row with another man over Winston&#x27;s reputation.

==Military service==

===Early war, marriage and Parliament===
In August 1938, Randolph Churchill joined his father&#x27;s old regiment, the 4th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars, receiving a commission as a second lieutenant in the supplementary reserve, and was called up for active service on 24 August 1939. He was one of the oldest of the junior officers, and not popular with his peers. In order to win a bet, he walked the 106-mile round trip from their base in Hull to York and back in under 24 hours. He was followed by a car, both to witness the event and in case his blisters became too painful to walk further, and made it with around twenty minutes to spare. To his great annoyance, his brother officers did not pay up.

On the outbreak of war, Randolph&#x27;s father was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. He sent Captain Lord Louis Mountbatten, along with Lieutenant Randolph Churchill, aboard (which was based at Plymouth at the time) to Cherbourg to bring the Duke and Duchess of Windsor back to England from their exile. Randolph was on board the destroyer untidily attired in his 4th Hussars uniform; he had attached the spurs to his boots upside down. The Duke was mildly shocked and insisted on bending down to fit Randolph&#x27;s spurs correctly.

Randolph was in love with Laura Charteris (she did not reciprocate) but his mistress at the time was the American actress Claire Luce, who often visited him in camp. He appears to have decided that as Winston&#x27;s only son, it was his duty to marry and sire an heir in case he was killed, a common motivation among young men at the time. He quickly became engaged to Pamela Digby in late September 1939. It was rumoured that Randolph had proposed to eight women in the previous few weeks, and Pamela&#x27;s friends and parents were not pleased about the match. She was charmed by Randolph&#x27;s parents, both of whom warmed to her and felt she would be a good influence on him. They were married in October 1939. On their wedding night, Randolph read her chunks of Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. Despite this, she became pregnant by the spring of 1940.

In May 1940, Randolph&#x27;s father, to whom he remained close both politically and socially, became prime minister, just as the Battle of France was beginning. In the summer of 1940, Winston Churchill&#x27;s secretary, Jock Colville, wrote (&quot;Fringes of Power&quot; p. 207) &quot;I thought Randolph one of the most objectionable people I had ever met: noisy, self-assertive, whining and frankly unpleasant. He did not strike me as intelligent. At dinner he was anything but kind to Winston, who adores him.&quot; The polemic against appeasement &quot;Guilty Men&quot; (July 1940), in fact written anonymously by Michael Foot, Frank Owen, and Peter Howard, was wrongly attributed to Randolph Churchill.

Randolph was elected unopposed to Parliament for Preston at a wartime by-election in September 1940. Soon afterwards, his son Winston was born on 10 October 1940. During the first year of marriage, Randolph had no home of his own until Brendan Bracken found them a vicarage at Ickleford, near Hitchin, Hertfordshire. Pamela often had to ask Winston to pay Randolph&#x27;s gambling debts.

===North Africa===
It was widely suspected, including by Randolph himself, that secret orders had been given that the 4th Hussars were not to be sent into action (they were, as soon as Randolph transferred out). Randolph transferred to No. 8 (Guards) Commando. In February 1941 they were sent out, a six-week journey via the Cape of Good Hope and the East Coast of Africa, avoiding the Central Mediterranean where the Italian navy and Axis air forces were strong. Randolph, who was still earning £1,500 per annum as a Lord Beaverbrook journalist, lost £3,000 gambling on the voyage. Pamela had to go to Beaverbrook, who refused her an advance on Randolph&#x27;s salary. Declining his offer of an outright gift (it is unclear whether submitting to his sexual advances was a condition), she sold her wedding presents, including jewellery; took a job in Beaverbrook&#x27;s ministry, arranging accommodation for workers being redeployed around the country; sublet her home and moved into a cheap room on the top floor of The Dorchester (very risky during the Blitz). By accepting hospitality from others most evenings she was able to put her entire salary towards paying Randolph&#x27;s debts. She may also have had a miscarriage at this time. The marriage was as good as over, and she soon began an affair with her future husband Averell Harriman, who was also staying at the Dorchester.

Once in Egypt, Randolph served as a General Staff (Intelligence) officer at Middle East HQ. Averell Harriman visited Randolph in Cairo in June 1941 to bring him news of his family. Randolph, who himself had a long-term mistress and several casual girlfriends at the time, had no idea yet that he was being cuckolded. He had recently been reduced to tears on being told to his face by a brother officer how deeply disliked he was, something of which he had previously had no idea. On 28 October 1941 he was promoted to the war-substantive rank of captain (acting rank of major) and put in charge of Army information at GHQ. For a time he edited a newspaper, &quot;Desert News&quot;, for the troops. He lived at Shepheard&#x27;s Hotel. Anita Leslie, then in an ambulance company, wrote that &quot;he could not cease trumpeting his opinions and older men could be seen turning purple with anger&quot; and that he was &quot;insufferable&quot;.

On leave in January 1942, he criticised the Tories for exculpating Winston Churchill&#x27;s decision to defend Greece and Crete. He was sensitive to the &quot;co-operation and self-sacrifice&quot; of parts of the Empire that in 1942 were in more immediate danger than the British Isles, mentioning Australia and Malaya which suffered under Japanese threats of invasion. He was scathing of Sir Herbert Williams&#x27; &quot;Official Report&quot; into the Conduct of the War.

His father, who was under great stress following recent Japanese victories in the Far East, visited him briefly in Cairo in spring 1942. Randolph had a row with his parents so violent that Clementine thought Winston might have a seizure. In April 1942 he volunteered for the newly formed SAS – to his mother&#x27;s dismay, because of the strain on his father. She contemplated cabling him forbidding him to go, but knew that Winston would want him to. He joined the SAS CO David Stirling and six SAS men on a mission behind enemy lines in the Libyan Desert to Benghazi in May 1942. The Benghazi Raid did not reach its goals and Randolph severely dislocated his back when his truck overturned in a road accident during the journey home. After a stay in Cairo he was invalided back to England. Randolph had sent few letters to Pamela, and many to Laura Charteris, with whom he was in love and who was in the process of getting divorced. Evelyn Waugh recorded that Pamela &quot;hates him so much that she can&#x27;t sit in a room with him&quot;. By November 1942 Randolph had formally left her; his parents, who adored their baby grandson Winston, sympathised with Pamela.

In November 1942 he visited Morocco to witness the American landings. Randolph encouraged the conversion of Vichy fighters to de Gaulle&#x27;s army, submitting reports to Parliament on 23 February 1943. In May 1943 Randolph visited his father in Algiers, where he was celebrating the successful conclusion of the Tunisian Campaign. Randolph, along with his sister Sarah, accompanied his father to the Tehran Conference in November 1943. On the way back they quarrelled again about his failed marriage, which may have contributed to the serious heart attack which Winston Churchill suffered at Tunis. He visited his father, who was laid up with pneumonia, in Marrakesh in December 1943 (General Alexander gave him a lift on his plane). He was promoted to the temporary rank of major on 9 December.

===Yugoslavia===
Randolph had encountered Fitzroy Maclean in the Western Desert Campaign. Winston Churchill agreed to Randolph accepting Maclean&#x27;s offer to join his military and diplomatic mission (Macmis) to Tito&#x27;s Partisans in Yugoslavia, warning him not to get captured in case the Gestapo sent him Randolph&#x27;s fingers one by one. He returned to England for training then in January or February 1944 he parachuted into Yugoslavia. Tom Mitford was also present in the group. He was later joined in Yugoslavia by Evelyn Waugh and Freddie Birkenhead. Round about this time he lost a bet to read various books of the Bible without speaking, but never paid up.

After the German airdrop outside Tito&#x27;s Drvar headquarters in June 1944 (&quot;Operation Knight&#x27;s Leap&quot;) Randolph was awarded the MBE in August, having been recommended for a Military Cross. Fitzroy Maclean reported highly of his abilities at this stage. However, Maclean wrote of their adventures together, and some of the problems Churchill caused him, in his memoir &quot;Eastern Approaches&quot;. Tito had barely managed to evade the Germans and Churchill and Evelyn Waugh arrived on the island of Vis and met him on 10 July. In July 1944 he and Waugh were among the ten survivors of a Dakota crash. He suffered spinal and knee injuries. He cried when he learned that his servant had been killed, but behaved with &quot;his usual loud rudeness&quot; as an invalid. After discharge from hospital in Bari (in the &quot;heel&quot; of Italy), he convalesced with Duff and Diana Cooper in Algiers. His father visited him in Algiers on his way to Italy—they discussed French and British politics.

Randolph was ordered by Maclean to take charge of the military mission in Croatia. By September he was back in Yugoslavia, where Waugh recorded that he was drunk most days, needed to have things repeated back to him when sober, and behaved awfully even when sober. Waugh described him as &quot;a flabby bully who rejoices in blustering and shouting down anyone weaker than himself and starts squealing as soon as he meets anyone as strong—he is a bore—with no intellectual invention or agility. He has a childlike retentive memory, and repetition takes the place of thought. He has set himself very low aims and has not the self-control to pursue them steadfastly.&quot; Lovell wrote that every observer, including Duff Cooper and Anita Leslie, recorded frequent &quot;drunken ranting&quot; from him at this period. On good days he could be excellent company. With Waugh he established a military mission at Topusko on 16 September 1944. One outcome was a formidable report detailing Tito&#x27;s persecution of the clergy. It was &quot;buried&quot; by Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden (who also attempted to discredit Waugh) to save diplomatic embarrassment, as Tito was then seen as a required ally of Britain and an official &quot;friend&quot;.

Tom Mitford, one of Randolph&#x27;s few close friends, was killed in Burma, where the campaign was approaching its final stages, in March 1945.

===Post-war===
Having been demobilised with the war-substantive rank of captain, Randolph received a reserve commission in the 4th Hussars as a second lieutenant on 28 May 1946. He was promoted to captain on 1 November 1947, and remained in the reserves for the next 14 years. He relinquished his commission on 28 May 1961, retiring an honorary major.

==Loss of parliamentary seat==
Randolph&#x27;s attendance in the Commons was irregular and patchy, which may have contributed to his defeat in July 1945. He had assumed he would hold his seat in 1945, but did not (he never actually won a contested election to Parliament).

Randolph had a blazing row with his father and Brendan Bracken at a dinner at Claridge&#x27;s on 31 August. The argument was about his father&#x27;s planned war memoirs, and Randolph stalked off from the table as he disliked being spoken to abruptly by his father in public. His father had misunderstood him to be talking about getting the help of a literary agent, whereas Randolph was in fact urging his father to get tax advice from lawyers, as indeed he eventually did. Randolph had to write later that day explaining himself.

==Second marriage==
Randolph was divorced from Pamela in 1946. His sister writes that after the war he led a &quot;rampaging existence&quot; as &quot;he always had lances to break, and hares to start&quot;. He was loyal and affectionate, but &quot;would pick an argument with a chair&quot;. Winston declared that he had a &quot;deep animal love&quot; for Randolph but that &quot;every time we meet we seem to have a bloody row&quot;. Randolph believed that he could control his temper by willpower, but he could not do this when drunk and alcohol &quot;fuelled his sense of thwarted destiny&quot;. His father no longer had the energy for argument, so reduced the time he spent with Randolph and the amount he confided in him. Randolph maintained good written relations with his mother, but she could not stand arguments and often retreated to her room when he visited. She was able to help him out of his financial difficulties, which he acknowledged, &quot;spared him much humiliation&quot;.

As Winston Churchill&#x27;s relations with his son cooled, he lavished affection on a series of surrogate sons, including Brendan Bracken and Randolph&#x27;s brothers-in-law Duncan Sandys and, from 1947, Christopher Soames, as well as, to a certain extent, Anthony Eden. Randolph loathed all these men. He had still not entirely abandoned his youthful fantasy of one day becoming prime minister, and resented Eden&#x27;s position as his father&#x27;s political heir. Randolph used to refer to Eden as &quot;Jerk Eden&quot;.

Noël Coward quipped that Randolph was &quot;utterly unspoiled by failure&quot;. He was blackballed from the Beefsteak Club and on one occasion was slapped twice across the face by Duff Cooper at the Paris Embassy for making an obnoxious remark. He reported on the Red Army parade from Moscow. He was still trying to persuade Laura Charteris to marry him. Although they were on–off lovers, she told friends that Randolph needed a mother rather than a wife. In 1948 he tried to persuade Pamela to take him back, but she declined and, having converted to Catholicism, obtained a full annulment, soon beginning a relationship with Gianni Agnelli. Randolph accepted that he could never have Laura, with whom he had been in love for much of his adult life.

He courted June Osborne, his junior by eleven years. She was the daughter of Australia-born Colonel Rex Hamilton Osborne, D.S.O., M.C., of Little Ingleburn, Malmesbury, Wiltshire. Mary Lovell describes her as &quot;a vulnerable and needy girl-woman&quot;. They had a stormy three-month courtship, during which at one point in June, high on a mixture of Benzedrine and wine, she ran toward the River Thames and threatened suicide, calling the police and accusing Randolph of indecent assault when he tried to prevent her. Evelyn Waugh wrote to Randolph (14 October 1948) that June &quot;must be possessed of magnificent courage&quot; to marry him. On 23 October he wrote to June at Randolph&#x27;s request, urging her to see Randolph&#x27;s good side, calling him &quot;a domestic and home-loving character who has never had a home&quot;. Randolph and June were married in November 1948.

Randolph&#x27;s son Winston, then aged eight, remembered June as &quot;a beautiful lady with long, blonde hair&quot; who made an effort to bond with her young stepson. Diana Cooper guessed at once after their honeymoon that Randolph and June were unsuited to one another. They had a daughter, Arabella (1949–2007). The marriage soon deteriorated; his sister Mary later wrote that &quot;He does not seem to have possessed the aptitudes for marriage&quot;.

==1950s==
===Candidate for Plymouth and Korean War===
Randolph stood unsuccessfully for the Parliamentary seat of Plymouth Devonport in February 1950. His opponent Michael Foot wrote that he talked as though Plymouth belonged to him, and issued &quot;a brilliant cascade of abuse&quot; in all directions, including his own party workers.

Randolph reported on the Korean War from August 1950, six weeks after the initial North Korean invasion of the south. The American and South Korean forces were bottled into a perimeter around Pusan and Taegu. His father gave him a handwritten letter of introduction to General Douglas MacArthur. This was dangerous work: 17 war correspondents were killed, either by enemy fire or in air crashes, including the correspondents of &quot;The Times&quot; and the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. Randolph was wounded on patrol near the Naktong River. Before seeking treatment he insisted on finishing his copy and giving it to the crew of a plane bound for Hong Kong.

While dining in Hong Kong, he had an altercation with the restaurant staff, who then proceeded to get the manually-operated lift stuck between floors, and to &quot;accidentally&quot; get grease on his new sharkskin suit while hauling him out. While Winston Churchill was researching his biography of his father, Alan Whicker, who had been Randolph&#x27;s dining companion for the evening, confirmed the account which Randolph had given to his son at the time. He returned to Korea to report on the Inchon Landings, the liberation of Seoul and the UN forces&#x27; crossing of the 38th Parallel. He then returned to the UK for an operation (6 February 1951) on his wounded leg.

Mary Lovell records that repeated stories of Randolph&#x27;s drunkenness, foul temper and financial difficulties date from this period. On one occasion, probably around this time, he became drunk and abusive in the first class cabin of a BOAC flight and had to be put off the plane at the earliest opportunity (the incident was hushed up to avoid embarrassing his father). Evelyn Waugh visited him in hospital, noting that there was no sign of his wife June, and observed that he had thought his own life dull &quot;but when I see the alternative I am consoled&quot;.

Randolph was involved in an altercation on board a train at Nottingham on 22 February 1951. He was denied entry to the locked restaurant car by a railway employee, then later asked by the same man to leave the reserved seat in which he had been sitting. While he stood smoking in the corridor, the man (by Randolph&#x27;s account) taunted him that he was &quot;in the soup again&quot;. Randolph called the man &quot;a bastard&quot;. At the next station Randolph was questioned by a plain-clothes policeman who had been summoned to board the train. The railwayman actually &quot;was&quot; illegitimate and he sued Randolph for slander, his lawyers arguing that it was &quot;not in the public interest&quot; for this fact to be revealed. The eminent barrister Sir Hartley Shawcross finally persuaded him to withdraw his lawsuit after eighteen months of correspondence.

He stood for Parliament for Devonport again in 1951. In 1951, as in 1950, Foot and Randolph exchanged invective in public, but got on well in private, often meeting for a drink at the end of the day when Randolph had been deserted by his own party workers, with whom he had a poor relationship. Foot and his wife Jill Craigie would sometimes even escort Randolph back to his train. Michael Foot later said to one of Randolph&#x27;s researchers: &quot;You and I belong to the most exclusive club in London: the friends of Randolph Churchill&quot;.

Having lost every parliamentary contest he ever fought (he had got in unopposed in 1940), he was desperately disappointed not to be able to get back into Parliament as the Conservatives returned to power.

===Early 1950s: Winston&#x27;s peacetime premiership===
In the days after the 1951 general election, while his father was forming a government, Randolph amused himself by ringing up Conservative MPs who hurried to the phone on being told that &quot;Mr Churchill&quot; wished to speak to them urgently, assuming that they were about to be offered a ministerial position. During the post-war era Anthony Eden remained the Prime Minister&#x27;s designated successor, yet when Eden married Clarissa Churchill in 1952, Randolph could hardly contain his utter contempt for his cousin&#x27;s new husband. He dubbed his ranting phone calls the &quot;Eden Terror&quot;. Randolph had long been jealous of Anthony Eden, and often wrote articles critical of him in the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;. These articles helped to harm Eden&#x27;s reputation. Eden did not reply in public, but complained privately to John Colville.

In 1953 Randolph was a Gold Staff Officer at the Coronation. In a speech at a Foyle&#x27;s literary luncheon at the Dorchester in September 1953 Randolph, who &quot;had had a few drinks&quot; asked why a rich man like the press baron Lord Rothermere (his former employer) needed to &quot;prostitute&quot; himself by printing details about the private lives of public figures, which Randolph described as &quot;pornography for pornography&#x27;s sake&quot;. Rothermere was not initially worried by this or the next speech. Randolph repeated his accusation at the Manchester Publishing Association on 7 October 1953 and in another speech. His lawyer and Sir Hartley Shawcross had both urged him to go ahead.

When sober Randolph could still be excellent company, as even his mother admitted, and could even switch off his &quot;temper&quot; when told that lunch was ready. He was assisted by Alan Brien to write the life of Lord Derby; while researching it in 1953, Randolph and June lived at Oving House near Aylesbury, which got him away from White&#x27;s Club and his gambling friends. The family trustees agreed to buy Stour House, East Bergholt, near Colchester. For the first time he had a proper home of his own.

However, his marriage continued to deteriorate, with occasional reports that he had blacked his wife&#x27;s eye or that she had left to stay with friends, or that she had flung all her clothes out of a window. There was one furious row at Chartwell, described as &quot;gruesome&quot; by June and &quot;his familiar rudeness&quot; by Mary Lovell. He called his brother-in-law Christopher Soames &quot;a shit&quot; and Eden &quot;a jerk&quot; while his father, still prime minister at the time, was so &quot;shaken with fury&quot; that he seemed about to have a seizure. Randolph retired upstairs for a further noisy row with his wife, declaring that he would never see his father again. Sir Winston patched up the argument at 1am. On one occasion he reduced Queen&#x27;s Restaurant in Sloane Square to silence by shouting at June over dinner that she was &quot;a paltry little middle-class bitch always anxious to please and failing owing to her dismal manners&quot;. Eventually another diner remonstrated with him for speaking to his wife in that way; Randolph rebuked him for interfering in a private conversation, only to be told that it sounded like a public conversation to him. This may well have been the final straw, and June finally left him about a year later, in the summer of 1954.

Even on the eve of his father&#x27;s resignation, Randolph told his cousin Clarissa Eden that he did not approve of her husband becoming prime minister.

Winston Churchill had declined a peerage at the end of the Second World War in 1945 (being offered the Dukedom of Dover), and then did so again on his retirement in 1955 (when he was offered the Dukedom of London), ostensibly so as not to compromise his son&#x27;s political career by preventing him from serving in the House of Commons (life peerages, titles not inherited by sons, were not created until 1958). The main reason was actually that Winston himself wanted to remain in the Commons—but by 1955, when his father resigned as prime minister, Randolph&#x27;s political career was &quot;already hopeless&quot;.

===Late 1950s===
Randolph introduced his father to Aristotle Onassis, on whose yacht &quot;Christina&quot; he was often to cruise, in January 1956.

He set up a private company, &quot;Country Bumpkins&quot;, to market his pamphlet &quot;What I said about the Press&quot; (in his speeches in 1953), which most newsagents refused to stock, and soon found himself involved in a libel case. He was carefully briefed on precise details both of facts and of the intricacies of the law. He was very quick-witted under cross-examination. His political opponent Michael Foot spoke on his behalf in court in October 1956, risking his own job on the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;. He was awarded £5,000 damages in 1958. His son writes that he had been &quot;completely self-controlled&quot;.

There is evidence that on a trip to the US in this period, he fathered a daughter, Rhonda Noonan, in Oklahoma whom he placed for a closed adoption. Paternity has not been established since no biological relative will comment on the question or provide a DNA sample to establish a likely blood relationship.

In January 1958 June filed for divorce from Randolph. He fell in love with Natalie Bevan when she called on him, a case of the &#x27;thunderbolt&#x27; of sudden infatuation, witnessed by Patrick Kinross who was there at the time. She was accepted as his companion by the Churchill family, visiting Chartwell, Hyde Park Gate and the &quot;Christina&quot;. Although they became lovers in the late 1950s, Natalie remained married to her husband and never lived with Randolph.

In November 1958 he gatecrashed a dinner in his father&#x27;s honour at the British Embassy in Paris (Sir Winston was receiving the Croix de Liberation from Charles de Gaulle, now returned to power in France); to general relief his mother, with whom he had not spoken in two years, addressed him as &quot;dear boy&quot;.

In November and December 1958 Randolph published six articles in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; about the Suez Crisis. Soon afterward he published &quot;The Rise and Fall of Sir Anthony Eden&quot; (1959). Questions were asked about it in the House, and Evelyn Waugh called the book &quot;despicable&quot;. Clement Attlee reviewed the book as &quot;singularly offensive and inaccurate&quot; and wrote that &quot;Readers of this book will not learn much about Sir Anthony Eden, but they should get a full appreciation of Mr Randolph Churchill&quot;. Sir Winston was deeply embarrassed about the book: Attlee later told Eden that Churchill had told him that he should have made his review stronger, while Sir Winston told Eden that he saw little of Randolph these days and that whenever they met, as Eden recorded, &quot;they only had a flaming row. Clemmie nodded sad assent&quot;. Eden&#x27;s biographer Robert Rhodes James described the book as &quot;a diatribe ... best forgotten&quot;.

Since February 1959, as soon as it was clear that Nigel Nicolson was in trouble with his local constituency Conservative Association, Randolph&#x27;s open wish to be MP for Bournemouth was the subject of much press talk. He was interviewed for the candidacy by the local Association in May, but was not placed on the shortlist. This was his last attempt to enter Parliament; it had not helped his case that in Liverpool 25 years earlier he had said &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go into Parliament to represent a lot of stuffy old ladies in Bournemouth, I want to fight for really hard-pressed people&quot;.

===Journalism===
Randolph inherited something of his father&#x27;s literary flair, carving out a successful career for himself as a journalist. He edited the &quot;Londoner&#x27;s Diary&quot; in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and was one of the best-paid gossip columnists on Fleet Street. He edited collections of his father&#x27;s speeches, which were published in seven books between 1938 and 1961.

Although he had no sentimental illusions about colonial peoples, he had no time for regimes based on supposed white superiority. He reported on Cyprus (where the British Army was fighting insurgents in the late 1950s) and Algeria (where French rule was coming to an end in the late 1950s and early 1960s). He particularly disliked the Apartheid state of South Africa, and on entering the country he was detained in customs for insisting on giving his thumbprint in ink (as a black person was expected to do) rather than signing the relevant entry form, until it was confirmed that he was entitled to do so. He obtained an interview with Hendrik Verwoerd, who was surrounded by revolver-toting bodyguards after addressing a rally in Boer territory. He particularly abhorred the Sharpeville Massacre, believing that &quot;10 London bobbies&quot; could have dispersed the crowd relatively peacefully.

==1960s==

===Natalie and relations with parents===
In 1960 Randolph published the life of Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby (described by Robert Blake as &quot;a reputable if rather dull book&quot; about a &quot;dull man&quot;) to prove to the trustees of his father&#x27;s papers that he was fit to write his official biography. In May 1960 Sir Winston Churchill approved of Randolph&#x27;s writing his life. &quot;At last his life had found a purpose&quot; his son later wrote.

Natalie Bevan declined his proposal of marriage in August 1960, but by then they had settled into a stable relationship. Winston Churchill (the younger) never heard Randolph have a row with her. Jonathan Aitken and Michael Wolff were eyewitnesses to Bobby Bevan bringing Natalie over for the evening and waiting patiently downstairs while she and Randolph enjoyed a &quot;Cinq à sept&quot;. His divorce from his wife June became final in 1961. The locals called him &quot;the Beast of Bergholt&quot; and he had a reputation for not paying small tradesmen. His researchers included Martin Gilbert, Michael Wolff, Franklin Gannon, Milo Cripps, Michael Molian, Martin Mauthner and Andrew Kerr.

Jonathan Aitken first met him at Cherkley Court, the home of Aitken&#x27;s great-uncle Lord Beaverbrook, where he was having a stand-up blazing row with the journalist Hugh Cudlipp who had made the mistake of criticising his father. In the early 1960s, after they had spoken together at an Oxford Union debate the previous evening, Randolph invited Aitken to drive him back to London and join him for lunch with his parents at 28 Hyde Park Gate. After Randolph had insisted on stopping three times for drinks on the way, they arrived late and with Randolph smelling of drink. Aitken beat a hasty retreat as Randolph had a blazing row with his mother while Sir Winston, then in his late 80s, turned red, shook his legs and beat his walking sticks together with anger.

Winston Churchill&#x27;s secretary Anthony Montague Browne recorded an incident on board Aristotle Onassis&#x27;s yacht in June 1963, in which Randolph &quot;erupted like Stromboli&quot;, shouting abuse at his aged father, whom he accused of having connived for political reasons with his then wife&#x27;s affair with Averell Harriman during the war, and calling a female diner who attempted to intervene &quot;a gabby doll&quot;. Browne wrote that &quot;[n]othing short of hitting him over the head with a bottle&quot; would have stopped him. ... I had previously discounted the tales I had heard of Randolph. Now I believed them all.&quot; Sir Winston, too old to argue back, was physically shaking with rage, so that it was feared he might have another stroke, and afterwards made clear that he wanted his son off the boat. As he was taken off the next day (Onassis had got rid of him by arranging for him to interview the King of Greece) he was in tears, declaring his love for his father.

===Conservative leadership contest, 1963===
Randolph often reported on American politics, and in Washington, DC he often stayed with his former fiancée Kay Halle, who was by then an important Washington hostess during the Democratic administrations of the 1960s. Parties with Washington insiders were often enlivened by his displays of what Aitken describes as Randolph&#x27;s &quot;boorish aggression and drunken bad manners&quot;. The American journalist Joseph Alsop stalked off from one conversation muttering that Randolph should entitle his memoirs &quot;How to Lose Friends and Influence Nobody&quot;.

In October 1963 he was in Washington (where he phoned through the news of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan&#x27;s illness and impending resignation to President Kennedy). He flew home then travelled to Blackpool, where the Conservative Party Conference was in session. Randolph supported Lord Hailsham for the leadership rather than Macmillan&#x27;s deputy Rab Butler. He knocked on the door of Butler&#x27;s hotel room and urged him to withdraw from the contest, stressing the 60 telegrams which had been sent to him in support of Hailsham, many of them concocted by his team at East Bergholt. He distributed &quot;Q&quot; (for &quot;Quintin&quot;, Lord Hailsham&#x27;s first name) badges, pinning them on people; he tried to pin one on Lord Dilhorne&#x27;s buttock without his noticing, but accidentally stabbed him with the pin, causing him to bellow with pain. After talking to Jonathan Aitken, who was working for Selwyn Lloyd at the time, he put £1,000 on the eventual winner Alec Douglas-Home at 6–1 to countervail his bet on Hailsham. Maurice Macmillan, Julian Amery and others were heard to say of Randolph&#x27;s antics on behalf of Hailsham &quot;if anyone can balls it up, Randolph can&quot;. He still hoped, somewhat unrealistically, for a peerage in Macmillan&#x27;s resignation honours at the end of 1963.

In 1964 Churchill published &quot;The Fight for the Tory Leadership&quot;. The former Cabinet minister Iain Macleod wrote a review in &quot;The Spectator&quot; strongly critical of Randolph&#x27;s book, and alleging that Macmillan had manipulated the process of &quot;soundings&quot; to ensure that Butler was not chosen as his successor. Robert Blake wrote that Randolph was &quot;blown out of the water&quot; by Macleod&#x27;s article (17 January 1964) and &quot;for once ... had no comeback&quot;.

===Final years and biography of his father===
In 1964 Randolph was laid low by bronchopneumonia which left him so frail he could only whisper. Later in the year he had a tumour, which turned out to be benign, removed from his lung. His mother visited him frequently in hospital after his lung operation. Randolph and Evelyn Waugh had barely spoken for 12 years, but they restored friendly relations that spring; Waugh commented that &quot;It was a typical triumph of modern science to find the one part of Randolph which was not malignant and to remove it.&quot;

At his father&#x27;s funeral in January 1965 Randolph walked for an hour in the intense cold, despite being not yet fully recovered from his lung operation. After his father&#x27;s death, Randolph&#x27;s relations with his mother, whose approval he had always craved, mellowed a little. Randolph organised a luncheon party for her 80th birthday at the Café Royal on 1 April 1965. She often sought and took his advice. He wrote a memoir of his early life, &quot;Twenty-One Years&quot;, published in 1965.

Winston Churchill&#x27;s doctor Lord Moran published &quot;The Struggle for Survival&quot; in May 1966. Randolph wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; criticising him for publishing within 16 months of his patient&#x27;s death and contrary to the wishes of the family. Diana Mosley wrote to her sister Nancy Mitford that at least Moran had not told the truth about Churchill&#x27;s children: &quot;Randolph vile &amp; making him cry&quot; while Diana was being given electric shocks for hysteria and Sarah was frequently being arrested.

Randolph never fully recovered from his 1964 operation. By this time his health was in serious decline. He had been consuming 80–100 cigarettes and up to two bottles of whisky per day for 20 years, far in excess of his father&#x27;s consumption. Drink had long since destroyed his youthful good looks. Accompanied by Natalie Bevan, he often spent winters in Marrakesh and summers in Monte Carlo, sometimes visiting Switzerland. His kidneys were failing, so he seldom drank alcohol any more, and ate little, becoming emaciated. Mary Lovell writes that &quot;though he still behaved with the arrogance of Louis XIV he was less explosive&quot;. Natalie spent the days with him before returning to her own house after helping him to bed.

In 1966 Randolph published the first volume of the official biography of his father. He and his team of researchers carried on working on his father&#x27;s biography despite his being mortally ill and it brought him fulfilment which he had not previously known. He had finished only the second volume and half a dozen companion volumes by the time of his death in 1968. Five volumes were planned (it eventually ran to eight, under the guidance of Sir Martin Gilbert).

In 1966 he signed a contract with the American politician Robert F. Kennedy to write a biography of his elder brother, President John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated in 1963. As a consequence, Randolph obtained access to the Kennedy archives, but he died before beginning work, on the day that Robert was assassinated.

==Death==
Randolph Churchill died of a heart attack during the night at his home, Stour House, East Bergholt, Suffolk and was found by one of his researchers the next morning, 6 June 1968. He was 57, and although he had been in poor health for years, his death was unexpected. Alistair Cooke recalled four years later that Churchill had told him the only time he would make the front page would be the day after he died. &quot;Alas, he died the day of Robert Kennedy&#x27;s assassination and he never made it.&quot;

He is buried with his parents (his mother outliving him by almost a decade) and all four of his siblings (Marigold was previously interred in Kensal Green Cemetery in London) at St Martin&#x27;s Church, Bladon near Woodstock, Oxfordshire. His will was valued for probate at £70,597 (equivalent to £ in ).

==Media depiction==
H. G. Wells in &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot;, published in 1934, predicted a Second World War in which Britain would not participate but would vainly try to effect a peaceful compromise. In this vision, Randolph was mentioned as one of several prominent Britons delivering &quot;brilliant pacifist speeches [which] echo throughout Europe&quot;, but fail to end the war.

Randolph Churchill was played by Nigel Havers in the Southern Television&#x27;s 1981 drama series, &quot;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years&quot;, set in the decade Winston (played by Robert Hardy) was out of office and Randolph himself attempted to enter parliament.

In 2002, Randolph Churchill was portrayed by actor Tom Hiddleston in &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;, the BBC – HBO co-produced television biographical film about Winston Churchill in the years just prior to World War II.

ITV TV docudrama &quot;Churchill&#x27;s Secret&quot;, a screenplay based on the book &quot;The Churchill Secret: KBO&quot; by Jonathan Smith. Broadcast in 2016, it starred Michael Gambon, and depicted Winston Churchill during the summer of 1953 when he suffered a severe stroke, precipitating therapy and resignation; the character of Randolph was played by the English actor Matthew Macfadyen.

Jordan Waller portrayed Randolph Churchill in the 2017 war drama &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;.

Ian Davies portrayed him in episode 5 of the 2022 TV series &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="486625" wikidata="Q683017" url="?curid=486625" title="Steve Smith Sr.">
<text>Stevonne Latrall Smith Sr. (born May 12, 1979), primarily known during his playing career as just Steve Smith, is an American sportscaster and former professional football player. Smith was a wide receiver for sixteen seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the Carolina Panthers, also playing for the Baltimore Ravens. He played college football for the Utah Utes, and was selected by the Panthers in the third round of the 2001 NFL draft. After retiring from the NFL, Smith became a sports analyst and show host for NFL Network.

Smith, a five-time Pro Bowl selection and three-time All-Pro, emerged as one of the NFL&#x27;s most productive wide receivers of the 21st century, leading the league in catches, receiving yards, and touchdowns in 2005. He played for the Panthers for thirteen seasons before signing with the Ravens in March 2014, and is the Panthers&#x27; all-time leader in total touchdowns (67), receptions (836) and receiving yards (12,197). In 2011, he became the 35th player in NFL history to amass 10,000 receiving yards. At the time of his retirement, he ranked seventh in NFL career all-purpose yards (19,180), seventh in NFL career receiving yards (14,731), twelfth in career receptions (1,031), and 25th in receiving touchdowns (81). Smith generated more than 1,000 all-purpose yards in eleven different seasons and at least 1,900 all-purpose yards in four of his first five seasons.

==Early life==
Smith attended University High School in Los Angeles, and was a letterman in football and track &amp; field. In football, he played running back and defensive back, and was an All-Metro League selection as well as an All-California Interscholastic Federation selection. Smith graduated from University High School in 1997.

In track &amp; field, he set a handful of school records, was named as an All-City selection as a high-hurdler, and also excelled in the triple jump and 300m hurdles. He had personal-bests of 14.95 seconds in the 110m hurdles and 38.73 seconds in the 300m hurdles.

==College career==
After graduating from high school, Smith attended Santa Monica College. While playing for the Santa Monica Corsairs football team, Smith quickly defined himself as a talented football player, and earned a starting position. During this time, Smith was teammates with future NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson, surprising fans of the small college team with their unexpected talents.

While impressing spectators with his performance on the football field, Santa Monica&#x27;s head coach, Robert Taylor, encouraged Smith to not play for riches or fame, but to play so that he might earn a scholarship to a Division-I school, where he could receive a better education. He also advised Smith and Johnson to not do touchdown celebrations and as Smith said, &quot;they put the cuffs on us.&quot; Smith took Taylor&#x27;s advice to heart, and excelled in his academics, not missing a single day of classes while attending Santa Monica.

After completing two years at Santa Monica College, Smith transferred to the University of Utah, where he established himself as a standout wideout for the Utah Utes football team in the Mountain West Conference where he was a teammate of future NFL running back Mike Anderson. While at the University of Utah, Smith set a record for yards per catch with a 20.6 average, and was chosen to play for the conference&#x27;s all-star team twice. In his first season on the team, he ranked 4th in the NCAA in both punt return yards (495) and yard per return (17.1). However, he missed their bowl game in his final season due to injury. After the Blue–Gray All-Star game on December 25, 2000, Smith began to receive attention from various NFL scouts. He was named offensive MVP of the January 13, 2001, East–West Shrine Game. Smith finished his time at Utah with 78 receptions for 1,608 yards and 12 touchdowns, with another 1,365 return yards and 4 touchdowns on special teams.

He and his wife have endowed an athletics scholarship at the University of Utah.

==Professional career==
===Carolina Panthers===
====2001 season====
The Carolina Panthers chose Smith in the third round (74th overall) during the 2001 NFL draft.

Smith spent a majority of his rookie season as a kick and punt returner, leading all rookies in net yardage with 1,994 yards, and landing in fourth place among all NFL players behind Priest Holmes, Marshall Faulk, and Derrick Mason. In his first play as a professional, Smith returned the opening kickoff of the first game of the season for a touchdown. Smith also had 10 catches for 154 yards, and rushed 4 times for 43 yards.

However, the team finished 1–15, winning only their season opener against the Minnesota Vikings.

====2002 season====
During the 2002 NFL season, Smith earned a starting position as a wide receiver and continued as the team&#x27;s kick returner and punt returner. Smith finished the 2002 season with 54 receptions for 872 yards and 3 touchdowns.

====2003 season and Super Bowl XXXVIII====
During the 2003 season, Smith played a critical role for the Panthers offense and helped lead them to their first NFC title in franchise history. He finished the regular season with 88 receptions for 1,110 yards and 7 touchdowns. He eclipsed the 1,000 receiving yards mark for the first time in his career in 2003. During the NFC divisional playoffs, Smith caught a 69-yard pass and ran it for a touchdown in the 2nd overtime period to defeat the St. Louis Rams 29–23. He finished that game with 6 catches, 163 yards, and the one TD. In Super Bowl XXXVIII, he caught 4 passes for 80 yards and a touchdown, and returned a kickoff for 30 yards in the Panthers&#x27; 32–29 loss to the New England Patriots.

====2004 season and injury====
Smith suffered a broken leg during the 2004 NFL season opener against the Green Bay Packers, and was out for the remainder of the year. Before the injury, he managed to record 6 catches for 60 yards, and even attempted a pass which fell incomplete.

====2005 season and comeback====
In the 2005 NFL season, Smith recovered from his injury to have the best season of his career. He earned the &quot;Triple Crown&quot; of receiving, leading the NFL in receptions (103), receiving yards (1,563), and receiving touchdowns (12) and became only the third player, after Jerry Rice (1990) and Sterling Sharpe (1992), to accomplish this feat in the Super Bowl era. Smith also returned 27 punts for 286 yards. His 10.6 yards/punt return was the second-highest of his career, after his 10.7 yards/punt return in his rookie season.

Smith dominated the first two rounds of the 2005–06 NFL playoffs. In a Wild Card Round victory over the New York Giants, Smith caught 10 passes for 84 yards and a touchdown, and rushed for 12 yards and another score. The Panthers then defeated the Chicago Bears in the divisional round, aided by Smith&#x27;s franchise record 12 receptions for 218 yards and 2 touchdowns. Smith and the Panthers then faced the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship. Although he scored on a 59-yard punt return, Smith was held to 33 receiving yards on 5 catches, and the Panthers lost by a score of 34–14.

Smith, along with teammates Jake Delhomme, Julius Peppers, and Mike Wahle were invited to the 2006 Pro Bowl after the season. Smith also shared the 2005 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award with New England Patriots&#x27; linebacker Tedy Bruschi.

====2006 season====

After suffering a hamstring injury and developing an ingrown toenail in training camp before the 2006 season, Smith returned to the field after missing two weeks of action. Smith was double covered frequently but still managed to battle through that and injuries to finish the year with 83 catches for 1,186 yards and 8 touchdowns. He was also invited to the 2007 Pro Bowl, his second Pro Bowl in a row and third overall. His contract ran up after the season. On March 1, he signed an extension.

====2007 season====
By May 4, he signed a new extension worth $45 million for six years. Smith started 15 games for the Panthers during their 2007 season, and led Carolina with 87 catches, 1,002 receiving yards, and 7 touchdowns despite playing with four different starting quarterbacks due to injury to starting quarterback Jake Delhomme.

====2008 season====
Smith made headlines during the 2008 training camp when he was involved in an altercation with teammate Ken Lucas on August 1, 2008. Smith broke Lucas&#x27;s nose during the fight and was later sent home for the remainder of the day after reportedly apologizing. Smith was given a two-game suspension by the team. Smith then suffered a severe concussion during the 2008 preseason opener against the Indianapolis Colts, where Smith was hit in the head when catching a pass. He continued to play that game, but did not travel with the team to their next game against the Philadelphia Eagles. After returning from suspension and scoring his first touchdown of the 2008 season, Smith presented the ball to Lucas on the sideline. Despite his 2-game suspension, Smith was voted to play in the 2009 Pro Bowl after he managed to catch 78 passes for 1,421 receiving yards and 6 touchdowns, leading the NFL in receiving yards per game.

====2009 season====
During Week 16 of the 2009 NFL season, Smith broke his left forearm on a touchdown catch in a game against the New York Giants causing him to sit out the final game of the year. Smith finished the year with 982 yards on 65 receptions and 7 touchdowns, just 18 yards shy of a fifth consecutive 1,000 yard receiving season. On January 1, 2010, Smith was placed on injured reserve following the injury, and on June 19, 2010, Smith broke his arm again while playing flag football.

====2010 season====
2010 was Smith&#x27;s worst season as a starter since 2002. Although he led the team in both receptions and receiving yards, he only managed 46 catches for 554 yards. In addition, he only caught two touchdown passes, 1 fewer than rookie David Gettis. Smith&#x27;s low numbers were due to the total lack of team offense behind rookie quarterback Jimmy Clausen. The Panthers finished last in most offensive categories and with a 2–14 record, which was the worst in the 2010 season, securing the 1st overall pick in the 2011 NFL draft. Smith&#x27;s dissatisfaction led to widespread rumors amongst the Panthers fan base that the star receiver wanted to be traded from the team for the 2011 season.

====2011 season====
Smith opened up the 2011 season strong, gaining 178 yards and 2 touchdowns on 8 catches, including a 77-yard reception for a touchdown. Smith followed his week 1 performance with another 150-yard receiving game, but had a fumble during the game as well. On November 27, 2011, Smith surpassed the 1,000-yard receiving mark. During Week 14, he became the 35th player in NFL history to reach the 10,000-yard receiving mark after a 125-yard performance against the Atlanta Falcons. Smith reached a total of 1,394 yards on 79 catches, and was one catch away from reaching the 700 rec mark. Smith was selected to his fifth Pro Bowl.

====2012 season====
Prior to the season, he signed a three-year extension worth $18 million. Smith played in all 16 games in 2012, recording 73 receptions for 1,174 yards and four touchdowns.

====2013 season====

In 2013, Smith continued to play well, despite hauling in only 64 receptions, his lowest since 2010. On December 22, 2013, Smith received a PCL sprain against the New Orleans Saints. The Panthers came out on top of the Saints 17–13. Smith received his 800th reception in the 2013 season.

Smith was released by the Panthers on March 13, 2014.

===Baltimore Ravens ===
====2014 season====
Prior to signing with the Ravens, Smith stated that if he happens to meet his former team, the Panthers, again, to &quot;put your goggles on cause there&#x27;s going to be blood and guts everywhere.&quot; On March 14, 2014, Smith signed a three-year contract with the Baltimore Ravens, worth $11.5 million with a $3.5 million bonus. In the Ravens&#x27; season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals, Smith caught 7 passes for 118 yards and an 80-yard touchdown, but the Ravens lost the game 23–16. In Week 3 against the Cleveland Browns, Smith caught 5 passes for 101 yards, including a 32-yard reception that set up the game-winning field goal, as the Ravens won 23–21.

In Week 4, Smith faced his old team. On the Ravens&#x27; second possession of the game, quarterback Joe Flacco threw a pass which was tipped by Owen Daniels and landed in the arms of Smith, who took the ball to the end zone for a 61-yard touchdown. Later in the game, Flacco fumbled a snap. He picked up the ball and threw a pass to a covered Smith, who caught it in the back of the end zone, despite being held by cornerback Melvin White. Smith finished the game with 7 catches for 139 yards and two touchdowns as the Ravens defeated the Panthers 38–10.

In Week 6, Smith caught a 56-yard touchdown pass in a game in which Flacco threw a career-high five touchdown passes and set the record for the fastest time to throw them (16:03). In addition to the 56 yard score, Smith recorded 5 total catches for 110 yards. In Week 15, Smith caught his 900th career reception against the Jacksonville Jaguars, as the Ravens won 20–12. In Week 17, Smith reached the single-season 1,000-yard mark for the eighth time in his career. In that game, the Ravens defeated the Cleveland Browns 20–10 and clinched a playoff berth.

Smith finished the 2014 regular season with 79 receptions, 1,065 yards and 6 touchdowns. He also fumbled twice and lost one. In the wild card round of the playoffs, Smith caught five passes for 101 yards as the Ravens defeated the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers for the first time ever in the playoffs. In the divisional round of the playoffs, Smith caught three passes for 44 yards and a touchdown, as the Ravens lost and had their season ended by the eventual Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots.

====2015 season====
During a press conference on August 10, 2015, Smith announced the upcoming season would be his last.

During the Ravens&#x27; third preseason game, against the Redskins, Smith was ejected along with cornerback Chris Culliver. Smith&#x27;s son went to Twitter, saying, &quot;1st time I&#x27;ve ever gotten to watch a game with my dad. Thanks @NFL&quot;. The Ravens&#x27; Twitter account tweeted that Smith was ejected for a skirmish, and his son responded to it by saying, &quot;Actually got ejected for ballin too hard&quot;. Smith was named starting punt returner after Week 1; at 36, he was and is among the oldest punt returners in league history. In the Ravens&#x27; first win against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 4, he was forced to leave the game in third quarter due to a lower back injury he suffered after a hit from linebacker Lawrence Timmons. Two days later, it was announced that Smith broke four of his ribs in the Week 4 game.

In a Week 8 game against the San Diego Chargers, Smith tore his achilles tendon, and it was announced he would be out for the rest of the 2015 season. He ended the season having played seven games, racking up 46 catches for 670 yards and three touchdowns.

On December 30, 2015, Smith announced that he would be returning to the Ravens for the 2016 season.

====2016 season====
Smith had another solid year with the Ravens, he caught 70 passes for 799 yards and 5 touchdowns. In Week 4, he had his only 100+ yard game of the season against Oakland, where he had eight receptions for 111 yards and a touchdown. In the game, Smith passed Andre Johnson to become the NFL&#x27;s active leader in receiving yards. Smith reached the 1,000 reception mark, the 14th player to reach this milestone. On January 2, 2017, Smith officially announced his retirement from the NFL. He retired with 1,031 receptions (then 12th all-time) for 14,731 yards (7th) and 81 touchdowns (tied for 17th with Art Powell).

==Broadcasting career==

One month after retiring from the NFL, Smith signed a multi-year contract to appear as an analyst on multiple shows on NFL Network.

Before the 2021 Carolina Panthers season, Smith joined the Panthers&#x27; broadcast team to call preseason games. It was Smith&#x27;s first time calling a game live.

Beginning in 2022, Smith has hosted &quot;NFL&#x27;s Most Interesting Jobs&quot;, a series for the NFL&#x27;s YouTube channel. Smith visits each NFL team to showcase the work being done by support staff, including the Minnesota Vikings&#x27; chef and nutritionist, the New York Giants&#x27; coaching staff, the Los Angeles Rams&#x27; equipment room, the Buffalo Bills&#x27; strength and conditioning staff, and the Kansas City Chiefs&#x27; kicking game ball crew.

In 2023, on his podcast, &quot;Cut to It&quot;, Smith referred to Jerry Jeudy of the Denver Broncos as &quot;JAG&quot;, for &quot;just a guy&quot;, an average player. Smith appeared as a pregame analyst for the Broncos&#x27; game at the Chiefs in October 2023, and attempted to approach Jeudy to apologize, but Jeudy swore at Smith and refused to engage with him. In response, Smith ranted about Jeudy on NFL Network, calling him &quot;mentally unable to handle constructive criticism&quot;, and advised other teams not to trade for him. The rant went viral. Dez Bryant called Smith&#x27;s on-air rant &quot;completely unacceptable.&quot; On a later appearance on &quot;The Pat McAfee Show&quot;, Smith apologized to Jeudy.

==Personal life==
In May 2008, Smith announced that he purchased a near-50% interest in the Velocity Sports Performance franchise in Charlotte and an equal ownership percentage in any future Charlotte area Velocity centers.

Smith is an Evangelical Christian. In 2007, Smith went on an evangelism trip to Togo and Nigeria to talk to soccer players about Jesus.

Before every away game, Smith and his family donated shoes to the homeless. He would also wash their feet beforehand. His goal is to hand out half a million pairs of shoes. To provide this service Smith works with Samaritan&#x27;s Feet. He says, &quot;This is an opportunity for me to give back, to serve...to kind of, really for me, open up the next chapter of my life.&quot; Smith planned to take the initiative global after retiring from football.

Smith and his wife, Angie, have four children: Peyton, Baylee, Boston, and Steve Jr.; Smith changed the name on the back of his jersey to Smith Sr. when Steve Jr., nicknamed &quot;Deuce&quot;, was born.

On June 14, 2017, it was reported by &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; that he secretly paid the full college tuition of Twitter personality and author Elexus Jionde. He said of paying for her $40,000 a year education at Ohio State: &quot;It&#x27;s not about taking and how much can you get for yourself. It&#x27;s about your life and (taking advantage of) all the resources and applying them and then paying it forward to someone else.&quot;

In 2019, Smith played for the &quot;Home&quot; roster during the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game at the Bojangles&#x27; Coliseum in Charlotte, North Carolina. The roster was made up of celebrities with Carolina roots.

On July 9, 2019, the Panthers announced that Smith would be inducted into the team&#x27;s Hall of Honor along with Jake Delhomme, Jordan Gross, and Wesley Walls.

A social-media exposé was released on February 22, 2025, that accused Steve Smith of having an affair with a member of the Marching Ravens, the official marching band of the Baltimore Ravens whom Smith played for in the final three seasons of his career. Tony Martinez, the husband of the woman Smith allegedly had an affair with exposed intimate text messages between Smith and his wife in a post on X. Martinez then recorded a phone-call he made to Smith confronting him about the affair and accusing him of having sexual relations with his wife, where Smith&#x27;s voice is heard saying &quot;I&#x27;m sorry&quot; before going completely silent.

<doc id="486628" wikidata="Q2145031" url="?curid=486628" title="Appalachian dulcimer">
<text>The Appalachian dulcimer (many variant names; see below) is a fretted string instrument of the zither family, typically with three or four strings, originally played in the Appalachian region of the United States. The body extends the length of the fingerboard, and its fretting is generally diatonic.

==Name==
The Appalachian dulcimer has many variant names. Most often it is simply called a dulcimer (also rendered as &quot;dulcimore&quot;, &quot;dulcymore&quot;, &quot;delcimer&quot;, &quot;delcimore&quot;, &quot;etc.&quot;). When it needs to be distinguished from the unrelated hammered dulcimer, various adjectives are added (drawn from location, playing style, position, shape, etc.), for example: mountain dulcimer; Kentucky dulcimer; plucked dulcimer; fretted dulcimer; lap dulcimer; teardrop dulcimer; box dulcimer; etc. The instrument has also acquired a number of nicknames (some shared by other instruments): &quot;harmonium&quot;, &quot;hog fiddle&quot;, &quot;music box&quot;, &quot;harmony box&quot;, and &quot;mountain zither&quot;.

==Origins and history==
Although the Appalachian dulcimer first appeared in the early 19th century among Scotch-Irish immigrant communities in the Appalachian Mountains, the instrument has no known precedent in Ireland, Scotland or Northern England. Because of this, and a dearth of written records, the history of the Appalachian dulcimer has been, until fairly recently, largely speculative. Since 1980, more extensive research has traced the instrument&#x27;s development through several distinct periods, and its likely origins in several similar European instruments: the Swedish hummel, the Norwegian langeleik, the German scheitholt, and the French épinette des Vosges. Folk historian Lucy M. Long said of the instrument&#x27;s history:

Charles Maxson, an Appalachian luthier from Volga, West Virginia, speculated that early settlers were unable to make the more complex violin in the early days because of lack of tools and time. This was one of the factors which led to the building of the dulcimer, which has less dramatic curves. He too cited the langeleik, scheitholt and épinette des Vosges as ancestor instruments.

Few true specimens of the mountain dulcimer exist from earlier than about 1880, when J. Edward Thomas of Knott County, Kentucky, began building and selling them. The instrument became used as something of a parlor instrument, as its modest sound volume is best-suited to small home gatherings. But for the first half of the 20th century the mountain dulcimer was rare, with a handful of makers supplying players in scattered pockets of Appalachia. Virtually no audio recordings of the instrument exist from earlier than the late 1930s.
The soprano Loraine Wyman, who sang Appalachian folk songs in concert venues around the time of the First World War, created a brief splash for the Appalachian dulcimer by demonstrating it in concerts, and was portrayed in &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine (right) holding her instrument, a Thomas. But Wyman preferred singing with the more robust support of the piano. The instrument achieved its true renaissance in the 1950s urban folk music revival in the United States through the work of Jean Ritchie, a Kentucky musician who performed with the instrument before New York City audiences. In the early 1960s, Ritchie and her husband George Pickow began distributing dulcimers made by her Kentucky relative Jethro Amburgey, then the woodworking instructor at the Hindman Settlement School. They eventually began producing their own instruments in New York City. Meanwhile, the American folk musician Richard Fariña (1937–1966) was also bringing the Appalachian dulcimer to a much wider audience, and by 1965 the instrument was a familiar presence in folk music circles.

In addition to Amburgey, by then winding down his production, influential builders of mid-1960s included Homer Ledford, Lynn McSpadden, A.W. Jeffreys and Joellen Lapidus. In 1969 Michael and Howard Rugg formed a company called Capritaurus. As well as being the first to mass-produce the instrument, they made design changes to make the instrument easier to produce and to play. The body was made larger, and they installed metal friction or geared tuners, rather than traditional wooden pegs, to make tuning easier and more reliable.

==Construction and form==
Organologically, the Appalachian dulcimer is a plucked box-zither; it is considered to be a folk instrument. Appalachian dulcimers are traditionally constructed of wood, and early instruments were typically made all of one wood, using wood commonly found in the particular area of the mountains where the builder lived. More recently guitar aesthetics and construction ideals have been applied, with a tone wood such as spruce or cedar preferred for the top of the soundbox. A harder wood, such as mahogany or rosewood, will be used for the back, sides, and neck, and a hardwood such as rosewood, maple, or ebony is used for the fingerboard. As the modern dulcimer arose in America, and the bulk of them are still made there, American hardwoods such as walnut, oak, cherry, and apple are also still frequently employed by makers.

As with many folk instruments the Appalachian dulcimer has been made—and continues to be made—in many shapes, sizes, and variations in construction details; however, certain forms have proven more popular than others, and tended to predominate. The general format has a long narrow soundbox, with the &quot;neck&quot; centered in the soundbox and running the length of the instrument. Typical instruments are 70–100 cm (27 1/2–39 1/2 in.) long; 16–19 cm (6 1/2–7 1/2 in) wide at the widest bout; and the soundbox has a uniform depth of about 5–6 cm (2–2.5 in). The top of the fingerboard sits about 1.25 cm (1/2 in) above the top of the soundbox. The soundbox will typically have from two to four soundholes, two in the lower bout and two in the upper bout. These take various shapes, with traditional favorites being a heart, or the traditional &quot;f-hole&quot; of the violin, but makers frequently personalize their instruments with their own unique soundhole shapes.

The overall shape of the instrument has taken many forms, but the most popular are the &quot;hourglass&quot; (or &quot;figure 8&quot;), the &quot;ellipse&quot;, the &quot;teardrop&quot;, and a long narrow &quot;trapezoid&quot; or rectangle.

At one end of the neck is the &quot;headstock&quot;, which contains the tuners. Headstocks most commonly have either a &quot;scroll&quot; shape (similar to the headstock of orchestral string instruments such as the violin), or a shape similar to that found on parlour guitars or banjos. To some extent, the shape of the headstock may be dictated by the style of &quot;tuners&quot; chosen. Older instruments and some modern &quot;traditional&quot; designs use violin-style wooden friction pegs. Modern instruments will more typically employ metal tuning machines, of either adjustable friction style, or geared (e.g. guitar) style.

At the other end of the neck is the &quot;tailblock&quot; which contains pins or brads for securing the other (loop) end of the strings. Strings are stretched between the end pins and tuners, passing over a bridge (at the tailblock end), and a nut (at the headstock), which determines the sounding length of the strings. In between the nut and the bridge lies the fingerboard, which is fitted with (typically) 12–16 metal, diatonically spaced frets; a zero fret may or may not be employed. Between the end of the fingerboard and the bridge the neck is carved down creating a scalloped hollow that passes close to the top of the soundbox. This area, called the &quot;strum hollow&quot;, is the space in which the plectrum, fingers, or beater is employed to sound the strings (see &quot;Playing&quot;).

Both single-player and two-player instruments have been made, as have multi-neck single player units (see &quot;Variants&quot;). The vast majority of Appalachian dulcimers are single-neck, single player instruments, and these have been made with anywhere from two to a dozen strings, three being the most common number on older instruments. Modern instruments typically have 3, 4, 5, or 6 strings, arranged in either three or four courses. Many possible string arrangements exist, but the following are typical:

* &quot;3-string&quot;: Three single-string courses.
* &quot;4-string&quot;: Three courses, two single-strung; one double-strung. The doubled course is almost always the highest-pitched (melody) course.
* &quot;4-string&quot;: Four single-string courses.
* &quot;5-string&quot;: Three courses: Two double-strung; one single-strung. The single string is usually the middle course, with the bass and melody courses being double strung.
* &quot;5-string&quot;: Four courses: One double-strung; three single-strung. The double strung course is the melody course.
* &quot;6-string&quot;: Three double-strung courses.

===Production===
Appalachian dulcimers are often made by individual craftsmen and small, family-run businesses located in the American South and particularly in Appalachia. It is easy and relatively common to order custom instruments, and custom-built Appalachian dulcimers can run considerably less in cost than other custom-built stringed instruments (e.g., guitar, mandolin, or banjo).

Cheap imports from Romania, Pakistan and China are slowly making inroads into the American market. John Bailey&#x27;s book, &quot;Making an Appalachian Dulcimer&quot;, is one of several still in print that provide instructions for constructing a dulcimer.

==Frets, strings, tuning and modes==
===Fret placement===
The frets of the Appalachian dulcimer are typically arranged in a diatonic scale. This is in contrast with instruments like the guitar or banjo, which are fretted chromatically. As early as the mid-1950s some makers began to include at least one additional fret, usually the so-called &quot;six and a half&quot;, &quot;6½&quot; or &quot;6+&quot; fret a half step below the octave. This enables one to play in the Ionian mode when tuned to D3-A3-D4 (the traditional tuning for the Mixolydian mode), where the scale starts on the open (unfretted) string. This arrangement is often found to be more conducive to chord-melody play. It also became common to add a fret one octave up from the 6+ fret, called the &quot;13+&quot; fret, and by the late 1970s these additional frets had become standard.

Eventually, some builders began to offer further additional frets at the &quot;1+&quot; and &quot;8+&quot; positions or (as an alternative) the &quot;4+&quot; and &quot;11+&quot; positions. These additional frets facilitate the use of still more scales and modes without retuning. This trend eventually led to the availability of fully chromatic dulcimers, with twelve frets per octave, permitting playing in any key without re-tuning. Chromatic fretting, however, remains somewhat controversial among dulcimer players, with traditionalists preferring what they feel is the greater authenticity of the diatonic fingerboard.

===Strings===
Appalachian dulcimers are strung with metal wire strings; wound strings may be used for the lower pitched courses. These strings are very similar to those used on banjos and guitars, and before manufacturers provided special &quot;dulcimer sets&quot;, banjo strings were frequently used. On a typical dulcimer string gauges range between about 0.026 in. and 0.010 in. in diameter, although gauges outside this range may be employed to facilitate special tunings or extended range playing styles.

===Tuning===
There is no one &quot;standard tuning&quot; for the Appalachian dulcimer, but as with the shape of the instrument, certain tuning arrangements have proven more popular than others. Traditionally, the Appalachian dulcimer was usually tuned (from left to right) to G3-G3-C3, C4-G3- C3, or C4-F3-C3. Note: Because the dulcimer is most often played on the lap or with the instrument lying on a table, when the instrument is held upright (headstock at the top), the &quot;highest&quot; pitched string will be on the left—this is the reverse of most other string instruments (e.g., guitar, bass, fiddle, etc.) where the lowest string is on the left. Dulcimer players, however, are accustomed to naming their strings from &quot;lowest to highest&quot; (as would a guitarist or violinist). which means that the strings are usually named &quot;reverse&quot; order from which they appear on the instrument, i.e., &quot;right&quot; to &quot;left&quot;. Thus the tunings cited above would more commonly be given as: C3-G3-G3; C3-G3-C4; and C3-F3-C4. This convention will be followed for the rest of the article.

With the Appalachian dulcimer revival of the 1950s and 1960s players began to favor higher-pitched tunings; this is not uncommon in the history of many stringed instruments, with players often claiming that the higher tunings make their instrument sound &quot;brighter&quot;. In consequence, the original traditional tunings migrated up a whole step, and became: D3-A3-A3; D3-A3-D4; and D3-G3-D4, which are the most common modern tunings for three-course Appalachian dulcimers.

===Modes===
D3-A3-A3, is in a &quot;I V V&quot; harmonic relationship. That is, the tonic note of the diatonic major scale is on the bass string and the middle and melody strings are at an interval of a perfect fifth above it. This tuning places the tonic (diatonic) fret on the melody string. This facilitates playing melodies in the Ionian mode (the major scale). The melody is played on the top string (or string pair) only, with the unfretted drone strings providing a simple harmony, giving the instrument its distinctive sound.

To play in a different key, or in a different mode, a traditional player would have to retune the instrument. For example, to play a minor mode melody the instrument might be tuned to D3-A3-C4. This facilitates playing the Aeolian mode (the natural minor scale), where the scale begins at the first fret.

While the most common current tuning is D3-A3-D4, some teachers prefer the more traditional D3-A3-A3 or the so-called &quot;Reverse Ionian&quot; tuning, D3-G3-d4. &quot;Reverse&quot; tunings are ones in which the key note is on the middle string and the bass string is the fifth of the scale, but in the octave below the middle string. This is sometimes suggested by teachers as an easier tuning. From D3-G3-D4 one can put a capo on the first fret to play in the Dorian mode, or retune the second string (to A3), to play in the Mixolydian mode, then from Mixolydian, capo the first fret to play in the Aeolian mode.

==Playing==
With only three or four strings and a simple diatonic fret pattern, the Appalachian dulcimer is generally regarded as one of the easiest string instruments to learn. The traditional way to play the instrument is to lay it flat on the lap and pluck or strum the strings with the right hand, while fretting with the left. Alternatively, the dulcimer may also be placed on a wooden table, using the table as an extended resonator to boost volume. The instrument is generally strung with the melody string (or string pair) on the player&#x27;s side of the instrument, and the bass string on the outside.

In traditional play, fretting is achieved with a &quot;noter&quot;—typically a short length of dowel or bamboo (see photo at left)—on the melody course, while the middle and bass strings ring as unfretted drones. This style of play is now referred to as &quot;noter-drone&quot; play. In some traditions, players use a feather quill with the barbs removed to strum the instrument. The frets on early mountain dulcimers were usually simple wire staples spanning only halfway across the fingerboard, meaning only the melody string course could be fretted. By the early 1960s, many dulcimer makers had abandoned staples in favour of manufactured fret wire extending across the entire width of the fingerboard. This enabled players to fret all the strings, allowing for chording and an expanded melodic range. A variety of new, &quot;noter-less&quot; playing styles emerged now collectively referred to as &quot;chord-melody&quot; play. The emergence of full-width frets also compelled makers to fret their instruments in equal temperament. The fret patterns on the older half-width-fret instruments rarely adhered to equal temperament, and intonation varied from builder to builder. With a simple melody played against the drone, these idiosyncratic scales could add warmth and a distinctive flavour to the music, but the old non-standard fret patterns often produce a dissonance when chorded that some find unacceptable.

Using modern dulcimers with full-width frets arranged for equal temperament, contemporary players have borrowed from chord theory and imported technique from other stringed instruments to greatly expand the versatility of the instrument. But a wide variety of playing styles have long been used. Instead of strumming the strings with a pick, for example, they might be strummed or picked with the fingers, or even beaten with a small stick. Jean Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;The Dulcimer Book&quot; has an old photograph of Mrs. Leah Smith of Big Laurel, Kentucky, playing the dulcimer with a bow instead of a pick, with the tail of the dulcimer held in the player&#x27;s lap, and the headstock resting on a table pointing away from her. In their book &quot;In Search of the Wild dulcimer&quot;, Robert Force and Al d&#x27;Ossché describe their preferred method as &quot;guitar style&quot;: The dulcimer hangs from a strap around the neck, and the instrument is strummed like a guitar, although their fretting style is still overhand. They also describe playing &quot;autoharp style&quot; where &quot;the dulcimer is held vertically with the headstock over the shoulder.&quot; Lynn McSpadden, in his book &quot;Four and Twenty Songs for the Mountain Dulcimer&quot;, states that some players &quot;tilt the dulcimer up sideways on their laps and strum in a guitar style.&quot; Still other dulcimer players use a fingerstyle technique, fingering chord positions with the fretting hand and rhythmically plucking individual strings with the strumming hand, creating delicate arpeggios.

==Contemporary use==

The Appalachian dulcimer is now a core instrument in the American old-time music tradition, but styles performed by modern dulcimer enthusiasts run the gamut from traditional folk music through popular and experimental forms. Some players exploit its similarity in tone to certain Middle Eastern and Asian instruments. Increasingly, modern musicians have contributed to the popularity of the solid-body electric dulcimer. Dulcimer festivals take place regularly in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, because the Appalachian dulcimer has achieved a following in a number of countries.

Though the mountain dulcimer has long been associated with the older generation, it has gradually attracted a number of younger players who have discovered its charms. Because it is easy to play, many music teachers consider it to be an especially good educational instrument. Consequently, it is often used in educational settings, and some music classes make their own dulcimers. However, due to limitations of budget, time, and craftsmanship, they are usually made from cardboard.
Brian Jones, of The Rolling Stones, played the electric Appalachian dulcimer on their 1966 album &quot;Aftermath&quot;, notably on &quot;Lady Jane&quot;. He can be seen playing the instrument during their performance on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. He was influenced to use the instrument after hearing recordings of Richard Fariña. Perhaps one of the most famous players of the Appalachian dulcimer is singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, who first played the instrument on studio recordings in the late 1960s, and most famously on the album &quot;Blue&quot; (1971), as well as in live concerts.
Peter Buck of R.E.M. plays the electric Appalachian dulcimer. Paul Westerberg of The Replacements also plays an Appalachian dulcimer on their 1989 single &quot;I&#x27;ll Be You&quot;.

Cyndi Lauper is also a high-profile mountain dulcimer player, having studied with the late David Schnaufer. Lauper played dulcimer on her ninth studio album &quot;The Body Acoustic&quot;, and the tour to support the record featured her performing songs like &quot;Time After Time&quot; and &quot;She Bop&quot; solo on the mountain dulcimer. Contemporary professional musicians who view the dulcimer as their primary instrument include Stephen Seifert of Nashville and Irish blues guitarist Rory Gallagher, who used a dulcimer on his later albums. Orlando-based musician Bing Futch performs using a special dual-fretboard mountain dulcimer as well as a custom resonator and is one of only two mountain dulcimer players to have competed in the International Blues Challenge, advancing to the semifinals in the 2015 edition of the competition; during the 2016 edition, Futch made it to the finals and was awarded &quot;Best Guitarist&quot; in the solo-duo category, despite performing solely on the Appalachian mountain dulcimer.

==Variants==
As a folk instrument, wide variation exists in Appalachian dulcimers.
* Body shapes: As previously noted, dulcimers appear in a wide variety of body types, many of which are recorded in &quot;A Catalog of Pre-Revival Dulcimers&quot;. A representative array would include: hourglass, teardrop, trapezoid, rectangular, elliptical (&quot;Galax-style&quot;), violin-shaped, fish-shaped, and lute-back.
* Materials: In addition to plywood, laminates, and solid woods, some builders are using experimental materials such as carbon fiber. Dulcimers are also made of cardboard. Often sold as low-cost kits, cardboard dulcimers offer surprisingly good sound and volume. Their low cost and resistance to damage make them particularly suited to institutional settings, such as elementary school classrooms.

* Number of strings: Dulcimers may have as few as two or as many as 12 strings (in up to six courses). Up to the 1960s most mountain dulcimers had three strings. The most popular variant today is four strings in three courses, with doubled melody strings.

* Sizes and range: Larger and smaller dulcimers are made, which extend the range of the instrument to higher and lower pitches, and to fill parts in dulcimer ensembles: 
**Baritone dulcimer: These are just larger versions of the regular tenor dulcimer, designed to be tuned to a lower pitch. Typically they are designed to be tuned a fourth lower: A3-E3-A2 or A3 A3-E3-A2, although any of the variant tuning patterns may be adapted to this lower pitched instrument.
**Bass dulcimer: Very rare, these monsters may approach four feet long. They were designed for ensemble playing, and are tuned one octave lower than the tenor dulcimer: A2-E2-A1 or A2 A2-E2-A1.
**Soprano or piccolo dulcimer: These are smaller dulcimers which range in size from about 80% all the way down to about 50% of the regular tenor dulcimer in length. They are designed to support higher pitches, and tuning is typically a fourth higher: G4-D4-G3 or G4 G4-D4-G3. The smaller size and reduced scale-length also facilitates playing by persons with smaller hands, such as children.
**Alto Dulcimer: This is similar to the soprano dulcimer but larger and better suited in has a lower pitch 
**Other sizes have been experimented with, including contrabass dulcimers.

* Courting dulcimers: One unusual variant is the &quot;courting dulcimer.&quot; This instrument consists of one large dulcimer body with two separate fingerboards. The instrument is laid across the laps of two facing individuals (the eponymous &quot;courting&quot; pair) and used to play duets.
* Double-neck dulcimers: Somewhat the same as a &quot;courting dulcimer&quot;, but with both fretboards (or &quot;necks&quot;) facing the same direction. Popularized by performer Bing Futch, it allows for multiple tunings without changing instruments.
*Solid-body electric dulcimer: acoustic dulcimers may be electrified with pickups, and several builders produce solid-body electric dulcimers.
*Aquavina: a dulcimer employing a metal resonator filled partially with water. The resonator is agitated while playing, producing an eerie oscillation of the harmonics.

===Hybrid instruments===
* Bowed dulcimers: Dulcimers that can be played with bows; in the modern era heavily modified variants have been made exclusively for bowed playing.
*Guitar dulcimer: a hybrid of guitar and dulcimer, with the body more closely resembling a guitar, but the string configuration and pegs of a dulcimer. The stringing pattern on these instruments are frequently the reverse of the dulcimer, with low-pitched strings on the left and higher strings on the right, and they are usually held and played like a guitar, in guitar position. This variant was first explored, and later patented, by Homer Ledford, and called the &quot;dulcitar.&quot; (see below)
*Dulcitar (also stick dulcimer or strum-stick): a long-necked fretted instrument, similar to a guitar or mandolin, with diatonic dulcimer fretting. It differs from the &quot;guitar dulcimer&quot; chiefly in having a much narrower and shallower body, closer to the proportions of the soundbox of the Appalachian dulcimer. These instruments are known by a wide variety of names, with the most common commercial model being the &quot;McNally Strumstick&quot;.
*Banjo dulcimer: resembles a standard dulcimer, but with a banjo-head on the body. This variant was first explored, and later patented, by Homer Ledford, and called the &quot;dulcijo.&quot; Similar instruments include the &quot;Ban-Jammer&quot; (Mike Clemmer), the &quot;Banjimer&quot; (Keith Young) and the &quot;Banj-Mo&quot; (Folk Notes). The &quot;Dulci-Jo&quot; is a banjo/dulcimer hybrid with a thumb string like a clawhammer banjo, 3 strings and a diatonic fret pattern, shaped more like a banjo and played upright, and built by Michael Fox of NC.
*Resonator dulcimer: a standard dulcimer, with a resonator added to the body, in imitation of the resonator guitar. This variant was first explored, and later patented, by Homer Ledford and called the &quot;dulcibro&quot;.

<text>Terry Lee Pendleton (born July 16, 1960) is an American former third baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played primarily for the St. Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves, but he also spent time with the Florida Marlins, Cincinnati Reds, and Kansas City Royals. During his 15-year career, he went to the World Series five times, yet his team never won a championship. After his playing career, he became a coach for the Braves.

==Pre-MLB career==
Pendleton started his baseball career as an Eastside Little League player, and then he moved on to play second base at Channel Islands High School. He played at Oxnard College from 1979 to 1980. The 1979 Oxnard team was the school&#x27;s first team, and he helped lead the Condors to a state championship berth while earning a scholarship. He transferred to Fresno State for the 1981 and 1982 seasons, and he was a key contributor to the team&#x27;s fourth consecutive conference title in the 1982 season, setting a school record with 98 hits on the season. He was recognized as an All-American. Pendleton had his jersey retired in 2007, alongside the jerseys of Tex Clevenger and Jimy Williams. He was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the seventh round of the 1982 amateur draft and subsequently signed with the team on June 12, 1982.

Pendleton&#x27;s minor league campaign began with the Johnson City Cardinals and the St. Petersburg Cardinals during the 1982 season. Pendleton was moved up to class AA baseball with the Arkansas Travelers for the 1983 season. He was selected to the league&#x27;s all-star team. Making steady progress, Pendleton was promoted to class AAA in 1984 and played for the Louisville Redbirds. After four games at second base, Pendleton became a third baseman, the position he would play the rest of his career. The Cardinals were so impressed with Pendleton&#x27;s development as a third baseman in Louisville that they traded their starting third baseman, Ken Oberkfell, to the Atlanta Braves and temporarily placed Andy Van Slyke at third base while Pendleton continued to gain experience. However, when Van Slyke committed 7 errors in 30 games, the Cardinals promoted Pendleton to the majors, and he began his major league career as the Cards&#x27; starting third baseman.

==Major League career==

===St. Louis Cardinals (1984-1990)===
Pendleton made his major league debut on July 18, 1984, against the San Francisco Giants. Batting sixth in the lineup, he made an immediate impact, getting three hits in five at-bats en route to an 8–4 victory for the Cardinals. In 67 games during the 1984 season, Pendleton had a .324 batting average, 20 stolen bases, and finished tied for seventh in Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award voting. The 1985 season saw Pendleton remain in the starting lineup at third base. His batting average trailed off, and he only hit .240 for the season and was caught stealing 12 times; he had 17 stolen bases on the season. He hit an inside-the-park grand slam off Joe Sambito when Danny Heep collided with Terry Blocker in right-centerfield in the fifth inning of an 8–2 win over the New York Mets in the second game of a doubleheader at Shea Stadium on June 9, 1985. The Cardinals advanced to the 1985 World Series, and Pendleton ended up hitting the Cardinals&#x27; only triple, doing so in the Cardinals&#x27; 3–0 Game 4 win. His statline for the 1986 season was only modestly better. His batting average remained low at .239 and he only hit a single home run, but he was able to steal 24 bases, hit 26 doubles, and 5 triples. St. Louis management became disappointed with Pendleton after this season, but manager Whitey Herzog pointed out to them that it was his base running and fielding (he led the National League in putouts and assists) that made him vital to the team&#x27;s success.

Pendleton answered front office criticism in his best season to date, the 1987 season. He improved in many statistical aspects in which he was struggling, including raising his batting average to a respectable .286. He was a strong contributor to the team&#x27;s pennant win, placing second on the team in home runs, third in runs batted in, and tied for third in stolen bases. Pendleton&#x27;s fielding efforts led to his earning his first Gold Glove, the first by a Cardinal third baseman since Ken Reitz in 1975, as well as finishing tied for 17th in MVP voting. Unfortunately, as the Cardinals reached the 1987 World Series to play the Minnesota Twins, Pendleton ended up sidelined for most of the series with a rib cage injury. Despite this injury, Pendleton&#x27;s switch-hitting ability meant that he was able to be used as a left-handed designated hitter during three of the four games the Cardinals played at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. He finished the series by playing three games, getting three hits on seven at-bats as the Cardinals fell in seven games for the second time in three years.

As the 1988 season began, Pendleton seemed to struggle where he had flourished. Despite racking up 80 stolen bases in his first four seasons, he only stole three bases during the whole 1988 season; in fact, he went the rest of his career without stealing more than 10. Injuries also plagued him in 1988, as he missed a few weeks with a right hamstring injury and had arthroscopic surgery in mid-September, which cut his season short. Despite this, Pendleton hoped to rebound for the 1989 season. Rebounding was exactly what he did, as he played in all 162 games for the only time in his career, finished ninth in hits with 162, and earned his second Gold Glove with an impressive .971 fielding percentage. Despite an impressive 1989 season, Pendleton struggled during the 1990 season. His overall production declined that season, as evidenced by his .230 batting average and .277 on-base percentage. By the end of the season, he was splitting time with rookie Todd Zeile. After the season ended, Zeile appeared to be the third baseman of the future for the Cardinals, and Pendleton became a free agent.

Pendleton is one of many major league players to have an error on a baseball card. His 1985 Donruss card lists him as Jeff Pendleton.

===Atlanta Braves (1991-1994)===
After Pendleton was granted free agency on November 5, 1990, the Atlanta Braves were undergoing a similar overhaul as they acquired a new general manager, John Schuerholz. Assuming command of a last-place team, Schuerholz went to work and recruited half of a new infield by first signing Sid Bream to a contract and then inking Pendleton to a four-year, $10.2 million deal on December 3, 1990. With a new team and a new contract, Pendleton had a career year during the 1991 season, leading the Braves from a sixth-place finish the year prior to a division title and pennant. He had his best individual season, finishing with a .319 batting average and 187 hits, both of which led the National League. He also hit a career-high 22 home runs and a career-high eight triples. Despite his impressive statistics, Pendleton was not selected for the All-Star Game. He was, however, named the National League MVP, edging out Barry Bonds by only 15 points. Pendleton also won the MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award because of his statistical improvements. Pendleton&#x27;s performance in the 1991 World Series—a rematch for him against the Twins and the third series he played in—was also impressive. He went 11 for 30, hit 2 home runs, and started at third for all 7 games. In Game 7 of the series, Pendleton hit a double in the eighth inning that should have scored a run, however Lonnie Smith did not advance home, and a double play to end the inning kept the score at 0–0, leading to the Braves&#x27; eventual Game 7 defeat and Pendleton&#x27;s third Game 7 World Series loss in a row.

As the 1992 season rolled around, Pendleton remained in peak form. In 160 games, Pendleton batted .311, hit 21 home runs, and scored 94 runs. He had 105 RBIs, which ranked second in the National League and marked the only time he passed 100 RBIs in his career. Also, he racked up 199 hits, which was good for the National League lead as well as a career-high total. He also finished second in the National League in at bats with 640, earning his only bid to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Pendleton also won his third Gold Glove at third base (the first by a Braves third baseman since Clete Boyer in 1969) en route to the Braves making their second World Series appearance in a row. However, despite a 6-for-25 showing by Pendleton, the Braves fell to the Toronto Blue Jays in 6 games, losing all 4 games by 1 run. This marked Pendleton&#x27;s fourth World Series loss in four attempts. Pendleton continued to produce extra-base hits during the 1993 season, hitting 17 home runs and 33 doubles. However, he appeared to be showing signs of slowing down; although he placed second in at bats with 633, he led the National League in outs with 490. His batting average of .272 was notably lower than his previous two seasons, and his luck did not fare any better as the 1994 season rolled around. He spent part of the season on the disabled list because of spasms in his neck and back, and after only hitting .252 for the season, Pendleton opted for free agency.

===Later career (1995-1998)===
Pendleton was granted free agency on October 24, 1994, and he was picked up by the Florida Marlins on April 7, 1995. Pendleton improved his batting average to .290, and hit 14 home runs while playing in 133 games. Pendleton went on to play 111 games for the Marlins in 1996, hitting .251 with 7 home runs. After spending the 1995 and most of the 1996 on the Marlins, he was traded back to the injury battered Braves. Right-fielder David Justice was lost for the season with a shoulder separation in May, and shortstop Jeff Blauser suffered a broken bone in his left hand, which caused him to miss some playing time. Acquiring Pendleton meant Chipper Jones could play at his natural shortstop position while Pendleton played third. Pendleton was traded to the Braves on August 13, 1996, for minor league prospect Roosevelt Brown. He went on to play in the 1996 World Series—the fifth World Series of his career. However, he was used only in a limited role en route to a 6-game loss to the New York Yankees, leaving Pendleton 0-for-5 in his chances for a World Series ring.
The Braves let Pendleton go after the 1996 season, and he signed on with the Cincinnati Reds on January 27, 1997. However, he was released on July 24, 1997, after hitting .248 with one home run and two stolen bases. While with the Reds, Pendleton had three stints on the disabled list, and after his release, he spent the rest of the season recovering and did not sign with another club. In January 1998, the Kansas City Royals were looking for veteran leadership, and on January 20, 1998, signed Pendleton to provide a veteran presence and help mentor its younger players. Pendleton was used in a limited role, backing up Dean Palmer. He played 79 games in 1998, splitting time between the designated hitter position and third base. After the 1998 season ended—his 15th professional season—Pendleton retired to spend more time with his family.

===Career statistics===
In 1893 games over 15 seasons, Pendleton posted a .270 batting average (1897-for-7032) with 851 runs, 356 doubles, 39 triples, 140 home runs, 946 RBI, 127 stolen bases, 486 bases on balls, .316 on-base percentage and .391 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .957 fielding percentage and led National League third basemen in putouts and assists five times each. In 66 postseason games, including 5 World Series, he batted .252 (58-for-230) with 26 runs, 12 doubles, 3 triples, 3 home runs, 23 RBI, 2 stolen bases and 12 walks.

===Coaching career===
After spending a couple years with his wife and three children, Pendleton got his first coaching job in November 2001 as the hitting coach of the Atlanta Braves. Pendleton served in that role through the 2010 season. In 2006, he was on a short list of manager candidates to replace Frank Robinson as manager of the Washington Nationals; a few weeks into the process, Pendleton withdrew himself from consideration. In 2007, Pendleton was also reportedly one of the front-runners to replace Tony La Russa as manager of the St. Louis Cardinals before La Russa ultimately decided to stay with the Cardinals. He was a candidate to replace Bobby Cox when the esteemed Braves manager retired at the end of the 2010 season.

When Fredi Gonzalez was announced as Braves manager after the 2010 season, Pendleton was moved from hitting coach to first base coach, where he replaced Glenn Hubbard. Gonzalez was fired and replaced by Brian Snitker in May 2016, and Snitker chose Pendleton as bench coach. Pendleton was replaced by Walt Weiss after the 2017 season.

It was set up by Arabella Churchill in 1981 after the success of the &quot;Children&#x27;s World&quot; area at the Glastonbury Festival. It is registered charity Number 282743. 

Children&#x27;s World was created to provide drama participation and creative play and to work creatively in educational settings, providing social and emotional benefits for all children, particularly those with special needs. 

&quot;Children&#x27;s World International&quot; (Charity Reg. No. 1079546) is the sister charity of &quot;Children&#x27;s World&quot; and was started in 1999 to work with children in the Balkans, in conjunction with Balkan Sunflowers and Save the Children.

Children&#x27;s World changed to a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO) and has a new number: 1172322. Children&#x27;s World International was closed and the projects taken on by Children&#x27;s World.

<text>Spencer Kimball is an American computer programmer, entrepreneur, and business executive. He is the CEO of Cockroach Labs, a company he co-founded in 2014. His work as a programmer includes creating GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) while still in college, and assisting the source code development of CockroachDB, the namesake software of Cockroach Labs. In addition to Cockroach Labs, Kimball was involved in the founding of other tech startups including WeGo and Viewfinder.

==Early life and education==

Kimball was born in 1974 to a Mormon family. He attended the University of California at Berkeley. While still a student in 1995, he developed the first version of GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) as a class project, along with his roommate Peter Mattis. Kimball was also a member of a student club at Berkeley called the eXperimental Computing Facility (XCF). During his time with XCF, he co-wrote the code for GIMP. Kimball said in 1999 that, &quot;From the first line of source code to the last, GIMP was always my &#x27;dues&#x27; paid to the free software movement. After using emacs, gcc, Linux, etc., I really felt that I owed a debt to the community which had, to a large degree, shaped my computing development.&quot; Kimball graduated with a B.A. in computer science from Berkeley in 1996.

==Career==

After graduation, Kimball mostly ended his relationship with the GIMP development community. He co-founded WeGo, a company providing tools for building web communities, in 1998 and served as the company&#x27;s co-CTO. While at XCF, he met Gene Kan, who was also a member, and the two would later begin working together on a file-sharing program for the Gnutella network, the open source Unix/Linux client &quot;gnubile&quot;. In 2000, he created a web-based version of GIMP, OnlinePhotoLab.com, that was short-lived. The technology was subsequently folded into Ofoto&#x27;s online image manipulation tools.

Kimball started work with Google in Mountain View in 2002 and relocated to Google&#x27;s New York offices in 2004. As one of Google&#x27;s engineers, he helped spearhead Colossus, a new version of the Google File System. He also worked on the Google Servlet Engine.

In January 2012, Kimball launched the company Viewfinder along with Mattis and Brian McGinnis, formerly of Lehman Brothers. The company developed an app that allowed social media users to share photos, chat privately, and search photo history without leaving the app. The company was acquired by Square, Inc. in December 2013. Kimball moved to Square&#x27;s New York City office where he became a senior member of the company&#x27;s East Coast team.

While at Google, Kimball used a database known as Bigtable and followed the development of its next generation, known as Spanner. The database organizes data between thousands of servers to allow Google applications to stay online, even if an entire data center were to go offline. Kimball wanted to use this software but found there was nothing available outside of Google as either closed or open-source software with similar capabilities. He elicited the help of Mattis, along with ex-Google Reader team member Ben Darnell. They formed the company Cockroach Labs to provide commercial backing for CockroachDB, an open source project he started on GitHub in February 2014. Kimball serves as the company&#x27;s chief executive officer and also contributes to the source code development of CockroachDB.

<doc id="486643" wikidata="Q6707703" url="?curid=486643" title="Lydia the Tattooed Lady">
<text>&quot;Lydia, the Tattooed Lady&quot; is a 1939 song written by Yip Harburg and Harold Arlen. It first appeared in the Marx Brothers film &quot;At the Circus&quot; (1939) and became one of Groucho Marx&#x27;s signature tunes.
It subsequently appeared in the movie &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940), sung by Virginia Weidler as Dinah Lord.

The complex lyrics by Harburg – with clever rhymes such as &quot;Lydia/encyclopedia&quot; and &quot;Amazon/pajamas on&quot; – were inspired by W. S. Gilbert. Harburg made many contemporary references to topical personalities such as Grover Whalen, who opened the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair.
Among the items, persons, and scenes tattooed on Lydia&#x27;s body are the Battle of Waterloo (on her back), &quot;The Wreck of the Hesperus&quot; (beside it), the red, white and blue (above them); the cities of Kankakee and &quot;Paree&quot;, &quot;Washington Crossing the Delaware&quot;, President Andrew Jackson, Niagara, Alcatraz, Buffalo Bill, Captain Spaulding (Groucho&#x27;s character in &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;) exploring the Amazon, Lady Godiva (but with her pajamas on), Grover Whalen, the Trylon, Treasure Island, Nijinsky, Social Security Number (behind her earlobe) and a fleet of ships (on her hips). Alternative lyrics suggest that Lydia&#x27;s buttocks have tattoos of a map and a caricature of Hitler: &quot;When she stands, the world grows littler. When she sits, she sits on Hitler.&quot;

The song was parodied by The Capitol Steps as &quot;Libya, Oh Libya&quot; (the Terrorist Nation) on their album &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Contra Boy&quot; and was featured in the 1991 film &quot;The Fisher King&quot; in reference to Amanda Plummer&#x27;s character. It was also used as a ringtone in the finale of the American TV show &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;.

<doc id="486645" wikidata="Q659839" url="?curid=486645" title="Amblie">
<text>Amblie () is a former commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of northwestern France. On 1 January 2017, it was merged into the new commune Ponts sur Seulles.

==Geography==
Amblie is located some 17 km north-west of Caen, 15 km north-east of Bayeux, and 5 km from the beaches of the Normandy landings in World War II. It is located in the middle of two valleys, those of the Thue and the Seulles, not far from the plain of Caen.

It can be accessed by the D22 road from Caen which passes through the south of the commune and continues to Creully. Access to the village is by the D35 road from Reviers in the north-east passing through the village and continuing south-west to Saint-Gabriel-Brecy. Apart from the village there are also the hamlets of Le Bout de Haut and Les Planches. Apart from a patch of forest in the west and small patches of forest at scattered points, the commune is entirely farmland.

The &quot;Seulles&quot; river forms the northern border of the commune flowing east then north to join the sea at Courseulles-sur-Mer. The &quot;Thue&quot; river flows from the south through the village to join the Seulles. The commune&#x27;s floodplain (meadows and marshes), its light hillsides, and its agricultural plain provide it with rich agricultural production.

==Toponymy==
The origin of the name may be from the Latin &quot;Amblia&quot; derived from &quot;Ambo Amnes&quot; meaning &quot;two rivers&quot;.

==History==
The origins of this small village, situated on the road of mills, are uncertain. The presence of man is old, however, as evidenced by human traces dating back to antiquity. For several centuries, the territory was attached to French nobility through two families, notable members of which were &quot;Achard de Bonvouloir&quot; and the Count of &quot;Buisson de Courson&quot;. The textile industry developed in the 19th century employing mostly women. The water mills established along the Thue operated until 1945 and treated threads for textiles as well as grain. The village, like many others, suffered severely from depopulation from the beginning of the 20th century. After the First World War Belgian farmers settled in the territory. Spared during the Second World War, even though it was very close to the landing beaches, the village assisted Caen by establishing a refugee centre for thousands of wounded victims. Integrated into the sphere of influence of Caen, the commune again suffered a rural exodus to the big city.

On 29 June 1944 the Canadian Red Ensign flew over the headquarters of the First Canadian Army near Amblie. For the first time in history the Canadian Armed Forces were fighting under their own colours.

This ceremony is depicted at the Juno Beach Centre where a flag is displayed showing the Canadian Red Ensign with, in the top left corner, the Union Jack, the flag of the United Kingdom formed by the superposition of the cross of St. George, St. Patrick and St. Andrew. It is hallmarked with a shield with the Canadian coat of arms which was created by King George V in 1924. The Red Ensign remained the national flag of Canada until 1965. It was then replaced by the red and white maple leaf Flag of Canada.

==Demography==
The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Ambliais&quot; or &quot;Ambliaises&quot;, alternatively &quot;Ambligeois&quot; or &quot;Ambligeoises&quot; in French.

==Culture and heritage==

===Civil heritage===
*The Chateau des Planches (1785) is registered as an historical monument. In the 16th century the area belonged to the Planches family. In 1738 it passed by marriage to Buisson de Courson. From 1785 to 1789 (the years being inscribed on a chimney stack) Nicolas du Buisson de Courson built this castle to replace a dilapidated building. Simply decorated the new house consisted of a central building crowned by a triangular pediment on each side flanked by two pavilions.
*The Chateau of the Achard de Bonvouloir family. The main part was built in 1792 and the mid 19th century out of Creuilly limestone. The property belongs to the descendants of Achard, a contemporary of William the Conqueror. The castle, surrounded by a large park, is composed of a central pavilion topped by a triangular pediment and flanked by two wings at the front. During the Second World War a camp designed to accommodate thousands of injured people from the city of Caen was located in the building.
*There are two Fortified Farms in the commune:
**The Bourg farm, called &quot;Fiquet&quot;, in the style of the 16th century. This farm was extensively rebuilt in the 19th and 20th centuries.
**The former Levallois farm from the 13th, 14th, 18th, and 19th centuries is a typical Norman farmhouse with its enclosed courtyard, dovecote, stables, bakery, its granary, &quot;charretteries&quot;, two porches from 1739 for the main porch and 1710 for the porch leading to the fields formerly facing Bonvouloir Castle. In the main body of the house are traces of architectural features such as two sinks in &quot;puisette&quot; style from the 13th and 14th centuries with its western gable, and a tower with a spiral staircase typical of the Middle Ages which was once part of a stately home very altered in the 19th century. To the north of the main house are the Thue and Seulles rivers, near the Mill de la Porte which had two wheels. During the Normandy landings the mill housed the headquarters of the First Canadian Army commanded by General Harry Crerar.
**The Chateau Farm from the 19th century called the &quot;Fiquet Vallerande farm&quot;. An architectural landmark for the region because of the &quot;Maine Anjou&quot; style.
*Several Mills in the commune (without mill wheels). Located on the road of the mills, in the 19th century the village had a dozen mills distributed along the Thue. These establishments played an important role in industry and were mainly grain mills in this region, or pressing textiles, as at Cully.
*The Seulles and Thue Valleys (the two rivers bordering the commune).
*The Marettes Nature Garden, a garden for associative learning for vegetable garden cultivation.
*The old Press in the area of the Bonvouloir family castle. A building in the medieval style dating from approximately the 15th or 16th centuries or possibly earlier - it was at one time the press for the village - its cider tower and Wine press can still be seen.
*The old Pedestrian Bridge (1743) made of Creuilly limestone (300X200X400). Located just after the last Amblie mill, this bridge spans the Seulles river. The second arm of the river is crossed by a footbridge. The bridge was used by cows grazing on the other side of the river. After its deterioration from this usage it was restored after the construction of a ford downstream for the passage of livestock.
*The Orival Stone Quarry (Merovingian). In this open-air quarry stone called &quot;Orival Quarry Tile&quot; is extracted. This stone is very coarse grained and is more resistant to frost than Caen stone. Quarrying from the Merovingian strata is important economically for several communes. Traces of ancient lime kilns testify to this. In the 11th and 12th centuries tile Orival Quarry tiles were used in the construction of monuments such as Bayeux Cathedral. These quarries were mentioned for the first time in 1692 in the land rents for Fécamp Abbey. Stone has been extracted continuously from the 19th century until the 21st century and is exported to large distances.
*The Menhir of Planches.

===Religious heritage===
*The Church (13th century) is registered as an historical monument. This church bears the marks of many rebuilds. The Romanesque nave from the 12th century, as evidenced by the Gadrooning, is retained one aisle. The western facade was redone in the 13th century. In the 19th century a tower replaced a small steeple from the 16th century based on the archway separating the choir from the nave. The early vaulted choir was partly reworked and a side chapel has been removed. Only the five-arched opening on the north aisle are Romanesque. Some of the sculptures are fanciful figures: such as an outsized man&#x27;s head or people being bitten by mysterious animals, resulting from workshop jokes typical of Romanesque style. The portal on the western facade is from the 13th century. It is surrounded by a Torus decorated with rings. The presence of this motif is rare, occurring in very few places in France.

<doc id="486649" wikidata="Q152738" url="?curid=486649" title="Anastas Mikoyan">
<text>Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan (; , ; ; – 21 October 1978) was a Soviet politician and Bolshevik revolutionary who served as the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the head of state of the Soviet Union. A member of the Communist Party&#x27;s Central Committee from 1923 to 1976, he remained in power from Lenin, through the eras of Stalin and Khrushchev, to his retirement under Brezhnev. He is often described with the famous quote &quot;from Ilyich [Vladimir Ilyich Lenin] to Ilyich [Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev] without a heart attack or paralysis&quot;.

An ethnic Armenian, Mikoyan joined the Bolsheviks in 1915, and following the October Revolution of 1917 participated in the Baku Commune. In the 1920s, he was the party&#x27;s boss in the North Caucasus. Mikoyan was elected to the Politburo in 1935, served as foreign trade minister from 1926 to 1930 and again from 1938, and during World War II became a member of the State Defense Committee. After the war, Mikoyan began to lose favour, losing his position as minister in 1949 and being criticized by Stalin at the 19th Party Congress in 1952. Following Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Mikoyan sided with Khrushchev, supported him against a failed coup in 1957, and played a leading role in crafting his de-Stalinization policy.

Under Khrushchev, Mikoyan played an important role in Soviet foreign policy, making several key trips to the United States and communist Cuba. He acquired an important stature on the international diplomatic scene, especially with his skill in exercising soft power to further Soviet interests. In 1964, Khrushchev was forced to step down in a coup that brought Brezhnev to power. Mikoyan briefly served as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal head of state, from 1964 until his forced retirement in 1965.

==Early life and career==

Mikoyan was born to Armenian parents in the village of Sanahin, then part of the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire (today part of Alaverdi in Armenia&#x27;s Lori Province) in 1895. His father, Hovhannes, was a carpenter and his mother, a rug weaver. He had one younger brother, Artem Mikoyan, who would be the co-founder of the MiG aviation design bureau, which became one of the primary design bureaus of fast jets in Soviet military aviation.

Mikoyan received his education at the Nersisian School in Tiflis and the Gevorgian Seminary in Vagharshapat (Echmiadzin), both affiliated with the Armenian Apostolic Church. Religion, however, played an increasingly insignificant role in his life. He would later remark that his continued studies in theology drew him closer to atheism: &quot;I had a very clear feeling that I didn&#x27;t believe in God and that I had in fact received a certificate in materialist uncertainty; the more I studied religious subjects, the less I believed in God.&quot; Before becoming active in politics Mikoyan had already dabbled in the study of liberalism and socialism.

At the age of twenty, he formed a workers&#x27; soviet in Echmiadzin. In 1915 Mikoyan formally joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (later known as the Bolshevik Party) and became a leader of the revolutionary movement in the Caucasus. His interactions with Soviet revolutionaries led him to Baku, where he became the co-editor for the Armenian-language newspaper &quot;Sotsyal-Demokrat&quot; and later for the Russian-language paper &quot;Izvestia Bakinskogo Soveta&quot;. During this time, he is said to have robbed a bank in Tiflis with TNT and had his nose broken in street fighting.

==Baku Commune==

After the February 1917 revolution that toppled the Tsarist government, Mikoyan and other Bolsheviks fought against anti-Bolshevik elements in the Caucasus. Mikoyan became a commissar in the newly formed Red Army and continued to fight in Baku against anti-Bolshevik forces. He was wounded in the fighting and was noted for saving the life of fellow Party-member Sergo Ordzhonikidze. Afterwards, he continued his Party work, becoming one of the co-founders of the Baku Commune under the leadership of Stepan Shaumian. In Baku, he worked as the editor of the commune&#x27;s official Armenian newspaper &quot;Teghekatu&quot;, and as the political commissar supervising its armed Armenian militia. He directed the seizure of the banks in April 1918, and the defence of Baku against the advancing Turkish army in July 1918.

After the fall of Baku, Shaumian and other Bolshevik leaders were arrested by the Centrocaspian Dictatorship. A commando unit, led by Mikoyan, organized their escape from prison, and they fled across the Caspian Sea to Krasnovodsk (today Türkmenbaşy in present-day Turkmenistan). However, at Krasnovodsk they were arrested by the Transcaspian Government, which was controlled by the British-allied Socialist Revolutionaries. The SR authorities executed the 26 Baku commissars, including Shaumian, on 20 September 1918 in the Turkmen desert. It was only by accident that Mikoyan avoided their fate. As American journalist Harrison Salisbury wrote:

After his release in February 1919, Mikoyan returned to Baku and resumed his activities there, helping to establish the Baku Bureau of the Caucasus Regional Committee (&quot;kraikom&quot;). In the middle of the Russian Civil War, the Central Committee assigned Mikoyan to the party organization in Nizhny Novgorod in 1920. In 1922–26, he became Secretary of the South East Bureau of the Communist Party and its successor, the North Caucasus &quot;kraikom&quot;. It was in that position that Mikoyan advocated granting Chechnya autonomous status. In 1923, he was elected to the Central Committee and remained a member of that body for more than 50 years.

==Politburo member==

Mikoyan supported Stalin, whom he had first met in 1919, in the power struggle that followed Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924; During the 11th Congress of the CPSU, in 1922, before the power struggle between Stalin and Leon Trotsky had broken out into the open, Mikoyan characterised Trotsky as &quot;a man of the state but not of the party&quot;. According to Trotsky&#x27;s biographer, Isaac Deutscher, by saying that, &quot;he summed up what many members of the Old Guard thought but did not yet utter in public.&quot;

As People&#x27;s Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo and was one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy&#x27;s in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit and corn on the cob.

Mikoyan spearheaded a project to produce a home cookbook, which would encourage a return to the domestic kitchen. The result, &quot;The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Kniga o vkusnoi i zdorovoi pishche&quot;), was published in 1939. Mikoyan even helped to initiate the production of ice cream in the USSR and kept the quality of ice cream under his own personal control until he was dismissed. Stalin made a joke about this, stating, &quot;You, Anastas, care more about ice cream, than about communism.&quot; Mikoyan also contributed to the development of meat production in the USSR (particularly, the so-called Mikoyan cutlet), and a Soviet-era sausage factory was named after him.

==The Great Purge==
In the late 1930s Stalin embarked upon the Great Purge, a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution in the Soviet Union orchestrated against members of the Communist Party, as well as the peasantry and unaffiliated persons. In assessing Mikoyan&#x27;s role in the purges, historian Simon Sebag-Montefiore stated that he &quot;enjoyed the reputation of one of the more decent leaders: he certainly helped the victims later and worked hard to undo Stalin&#x27;s rule after the Leader&#x27;s death.&quot; Mikoyan tried to save some close-knit companions from being executed. However, in 1936 he enthusiastically supported the execution of Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, claiming it to be a &quot;just verdict.&quot; As with other leading officials in 1937, Mikoyan signed death-lists given to him by the NKVD. The purges were often accomplished by officials close to Stalin, giving them the assignment largely as a way to test their loyalty to the regime.

In September 1937, Stalin dispatched Georgy Malenkov and Mikhail Litvin (1892–1938) of the NKVD to Yerevan, the capital of Soviet Armenia, in response to the death of Sahak Ter-Gabrielyan. Their mission was to oversee the purge of the Armenian Communist Party and its leaders First Secretary Amatuni Amatuni and NKVD chief Khachik Mughdusi, both Beria loyalists. Stalin later dispatched Mikoyan too, in order to test his loyalty and send a signal to Soviet Armenian leaders. Stalin did not trust Mikoyan due to his leniency towards the persecuted. In several instances, Mikoyan had intervened on behalf of his friends and colleagues to save them. During his trip to Armenia, he tried, but failed, to save one individual (Daniel &quot;Danush&quot; Shahverdyan) from being executed. However, on Stalin&#x27;s orders, he led the attack during a stormy session of the Central Committee of the Armenian Communist Party in September 1937, during which Amatuni angrily called him a &quot;liar.&quot; More than a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office.

==World War II==
In September 1939, under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union each carved out their own spheres of influence in Poland and Eastern Europe. The Soviets arrested 26,000 Polish officers in the eastern portion of Poland and in March 1940, after some deliberation, Stalin and five other members of the Politburo, Mikoyan included, signed an order for their execution as &quot;nationalists and counterrevolutionaries&quot;. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Mikoyan was placed in charge of organizing the transportation of food and supplies. His son Vladimir, a pilot in the Red Air Force, died in combat when his plane was shot down over Stalingrad. Mikoyan&#x27;s main assignment throughout the war was supplying the Red Army with materiel, food and other necessities.

Mikoyan is also credited for his significant role in the 1941 relocation of Soviet industry from the threatened western cities, such as Moscow and Leningrad, eastward to the Urals, Western Siberia, the Volga region, and other safer zones.

In February 1942, by order of Stalin, Mikoyan became a Special Representative of the State Defense Committee. He had not been a member until that point because Beria believed he would be of more use in government administration. Mikoyan was decorated with a Hero of Socialist Labor in 1943 for his efforts. In 1946, he became the Vice-Premier of the Council of Ministers. As Minister of Foreign Trade, he was responsible for the dismantlement of industry and infrastructure in Soviet-occupied Eastern Germany for collection as reparations.

==Thaw and de-Stalinization==

Shortly before his death in 1953, Stalin considered launching a new purge against Mikoyan, Vyacheslav Molotov, and several other Party leaders. Mikoyan and others gradually began to fall out of favor and, in one instance, were accused of plotting against Stalin. Stalin&#x27;s plans never came to fruition, however, as he died before he could put them into motion. Mikoyan originally argued against punishing Stalin&#x27;s right-hand man, Beria, but later gave in to popular support among Party members for his arrest. Mikoyan remained in the government after Stalin&#x27;s death, in the post of Minister of Trade under Malenkov. He supported Nikita Khrushchev in the power struggle to succeed Stalin and became First Deputy Premier in recognition of his services.

In 1956, Mikoyan helped Khrushchev organize the &quot;Secret Speech&quot;, delivered by Khrushchev at the 20th Party Congress, which denounced Stalin&#x27;s personality cult. It was he, and not Khrushchev, who made the first anti-Stalinist speech at the 20th Congress. Along with Khrushchev, he helped to roll back some of the stifling restrictions on national cultures imposed during Stalin&#x27;s time. In 1954, he visited his native Armenia and gave a speech in Yerevan, where he encouraged Armenians to republish the works of Raffi and the purged writer, Yeghishe Charents. Behind the scenes, he assisted Soviet Armenian leaders in the rehabilitation of former &quot;enemies&quot; in the republic, and worked with Lev Shahumyan (son of Stepan), as well as Gulag returnees Alexei Snegov and Olga Shatunovskaya on the process of de-Stalinization.

In 1957, Mikoyan refused to back an attempt by Malenkov and Molotov to remove Khrushchev from power, and thus secured his position as one of Khrushchev&#x27;s closest allies during the Thaw. He backed Khrushchev because of his strong support for de-Stalinization, and his belief that a triumph by the plotters might have given way to purges similar to those in the 1930s. In recognition of his support and his economic talents, Khrushchev appointed Mikoyan First Deputy Premier.

In 1962, Khrushchev sent Mikoyan and Frol Kozlov to Novocherkassk to deal with growing unrest in the southern city. Although Mikoyan opposed force and sought dialogue with the demonstrators, Kozlov pushed for a harsh response, resulting in the Novocherkassk massacre.

==Foreign diplomacy==
=== China ===
Mikoyan was the first Politburo member to make direct contact with the Chinese Communist Party Chairman, Mao Zedong. He arrived at Mao&#x27;s headquarters on 30 January 1949, one day before the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek was forced to abandon Nanjing, which was then China&#x27;s capital, and move to Guangzhou. Mikoyan reported that Mao was proclaiming Stalin to be the supreme leader of world communism and &#x27;teacher of the Chinese people&#x27;, but in his report he added that Mao did not genuinely believe what he was saying. It was at Stalin&#x27;s behest that Mikoyan asked that the Chinese communists arrest the US journalist Sidney Rittenberg.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
On 11 November 1951, Mikoyan made a sudden visit to Prague to deliver a message from Stalin to President Klement Gottwald insisting that Rudolf Slánský, former Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, should be arrested. When Gottwald demurred, Mikoyan broke off the interview to ring Stalin, before repeating the demand, after which Gottwald capitulated. This was the biggest single step towards the preparation of the Slánský Trial. Mikoyan&#x27;s role in the repression in Czechoslovakia was kept secret until the Prague Spring of 1968.

===Hungary===
In July 1956, Mikoyan visited the People&#x27;s Republic of Hungary to oversee the removal of the dictator Mátyás Rákosi. He returned in October to gather information on the developing crisis caused by the revolution against the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party government there. Together with Mikhail Suslov, Mikoyan traveled to Budapest in an armored personnel carrier, in view of the shooting in the streets. He sent a telegram to Moscow reporting his impressions of the situation. &quot;We had the impression that Ernő Gerő especially, but the other comrades as well, are exaggerating the strength of the opponent and underestimating their own strength,&quot; he and Suslov wrote. Mikoyan strongly opposed the decision by Khrushchev and the Politburo to use Soviet troops, believing it would destroy the Soviet Union&#x27;s international reputation, instead arguing for the application of &quot;military intimidation&quot; and economic pressure. The crushing of the revolution by Soviet forces nearly led to Mikoyan&#x27;s resignation.

===United States===

Khrushchev&#x27;s liberalization of hardline policies led to an improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States during the late 1950s. As Khrushchev&#x27;s primary emissary, Mikoyan visited the United States several times. Despite the volatility of the Cold War between the two superpowers, many Americans received Mikoyan amiably, including Minnesota Democrat Hubert Humphrey, who characterized him as someone who showed a &quot;flexibility of attitude&quot; and New York governor Averell Harriman, who described him as a &quot;less rigid&quot; Soviet politician.

During November 1958 Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of Berlin into an independent, demilitarized &quot;free city&quot;, giving the United States, Great Britain, and France a six-month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin, or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the East Germans. Mikoyan disapproved of Khrushchev&#x27;s actions, claiming they violated &quot;Party principle.&quot; Khrushchev had proposed the ultimatum to the West before discussing it with the Central Committee. Ruud van Djik, a historian, believed Mikoyan was angry because Khrushchev did not consult him about the proposal. When asked by Khrushchev to ease tension with the United States, Mikoyan responded, &quot;You started it, so you go!&quot;
However, Mikoyan eventually left for Washington DC, which was the first time a senior governing member of the USSR&#x27;s Council of Ministers visited the United States on a diplomatic mission to its leadership. Furthermore, Mikoyan approached the mission with unprecedented informality, beginning with phrasing his visa request to US Embassy as &quot;a fortnight&#x27;s holiday&quot; to visit his friend, Mikhail Menshikov, the then Soviet Ambassador to the United States. While the White House was taken off guard by this seemingly impromptu diplomatic mission, Mikoyan was invited to speak to numerous elite American organizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the Detroit Club in which he professed his hopes for the USSR to have a more peaceful relationship with the US. While in Cleveland, Mikoyan gifted a troika to industrialist Cyrus Eaton and admired the city&#x27;s Terminal Tower, which reminded him of the tower at Moscow State University.

In addition to such well received engagements, Mikoyan indulged in more informal opportunities to meet the public such as having breakfast at a Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant on the New Jersey Turnpike, visiting Macy&#x27;s Department Store in New York City and meeting celebrities in Hollywood like Jerry Lewis and Sophia Loren before having an audience with President Dwight Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. Although Mikoyan failed to alter the US&#x27;s Berlin policy, he was hailed in the US for easing international tensions with an innovative emphasis on soft diplomacy that largely went over well with the American public.

Mikoyan disapproved of Khrushchev&#x27;s walkout from the 1960 Paris Summit over the U-2 Crisis of 1960, which he believed kept tension in the Cold War high for another fifteen years. However, throughout this time, he remained Khrushchev&#x27;s closest ally in the upper echelons of the Soviet leadership. As Mikoyan later noted, Khrushchev &quot;engaged [in] inexcusable hysterics&quot;.

In November 1963 Mikoyan was asked by Khrushchev to represent the USSR at President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s funeral. At the funeral ceremony, Mikoyan appeared visibly shaken by the president&#x27;s death and was approached by Jacqueline Kennedy, who took his hand and conveyed to him the following message: &quot;Please tell Mr. Chairman [Khrushchev] that I know he and my husband worked together for a peaceful world, and now he and you must carry on my husband&#x27;s work.&quot;

===Cuba and the Missile Crisis===

The Soviet government welcomed the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista by Fidel Castro&#x27;s pro-socialist rebels in the Cuban Revolution of 1959. Khrushchev realized the potential of a Soviet ally in the Caribbean and dispatched Mikoyan as one of the top diplomats in Latin America. He was the first Soviet official to visit Cuba after the revolution, except for Soviet intelligence officers, and he secured important trade agreements with the new government. He left Cuba with a very positive impression, saying that the atmosphere there made him feel &quot;as though I had returned to my childhood.&quot;

Khrushchev told Mikoyan of his idea of shipping Soviet missiles to Cuba. Mikoyan was opposed to the idea, and was even more opposed to giving the Cubans control over the Soviet missiles. In early November 1962, after the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to a framework to remove Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba, Khrushchev dispatched Mikoyan to Havana to help persuade Castro to cooperate in the withdrawal. Just prior to beginning negotiations with Castro, Mikoyan was informed about the death of his wife, Ashkhen, in Moscow; rather than return there for the funeral, Mikoyan opted to stay and sent his son Sergo there instead.

Castro was adamant that the missiles remain but Mikoyan, seeking to avoid a full-fledged confrontation with the United States, attempted to convince him otherwise. He told Castro, &quot;You know that not only in these letters but today also, we hold to the position that you will keep all the weapons and all the military specialists with the exception of the &#x27;offensive&#x27; weapons and associated service personnel, which were promised to be withdrawn in Khrushchev&#x27;s letter [of October 27].&quot; Castro balked at the idea of further concessions, namely the removal of the Il-28 bombers and tactical nuclear weapons still left in Cuba. Eventually, after several tense and grueling weeks of negotiations, he finally relented, and the missiles and the bombers were removed in December of that year.

==Head of state and retirement==
On 15 July 1964, Mikoyan was appointed as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, replacing Leonid Brezhnev, who received a promotion within the Party. Mikoyan&#x27;s new position was largely ceremonial; it was noted that his declining health and old age were being considered.

Some historians are convinced that by 1964 Mikoyan believed that Khrushchev had turned into a liability to the Party, and that he was involved in the October 1964 coup that brought Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin to power. However, William Taubman disputes this, as Mikoyan was the only member of the Presidium (the name for the Politburo at this time) to defend Khrushchev. Mikoyan, however, did vote to force Khrushchev&#x27;s retirement (so as, in traditional Soviet style, to make the vote unanimous). Alone among Khrushchev&#x27;s colleagues, Mikoyan wished the former leader well in his retirement, and he, alone, visited Khrushchev at his dacha a few years later. Mikoyan laid a wreath and sent a letter of condolence at Khrushchev&#x27;s funeral in 1971.

Due to his partial defense of Khrushchev during his ouster, Mikoyan lost his high standing with the new Soviet leadership. The Politburo forced Mikoyan to retire from his seat in the Politburo due to old age. Mikoyan quickly also lost his post as head of state and was succeeded in this post by Nikolai Podgorny on 9 December 1965. In retirement, Mikoyan, like Khrushchev, wrote frank but selective memoirs from his political career, including his revolutionary activity in Baku. He died on 21 October 1978, at the age of 82, from natural causes and was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. He received six commendations of the Order of Lenin.

==Personality and legacy==

Simon Sebag-Montefiore referred to Mikoyan as &quot;slim, circumspect, wily and industrious&quot;. An intelligent man, he had the command of several languages. In addition to Armenian and Russian, he understood English and learned German on his own by translating the German version of Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot; into Russian. Unlike many others, Mikoyan was not afraid to get into heated arguments with Stalin. &quot;One was never bored with Mikoyan&quot;, Artyom Sergeev notes, while Khrushchev called him a true cavalier. However, Khrushchev warned of trusting &quot;that shrewd fox from the east.&quot; In a close conversation with Vyacheslav Molotov and Nikolai Bukharin, Stalin referred to Mikoyan as a &quot;duckling in politics&quot;; he noted, however, that if Mikoyan ever took a serious shot he would improve. Mikoyan had five boys (Stepan, Vladimir, Aleksei, Vano, and Sergo), and adopted the two sons of the late Bolshevik leader Stepan Shahumyan. He had so many children under his care that he and his wife faced financial problems. His wife Ashkhen would borrow money from Politburo wives who had fewer children. If Mikoyan had discovered this, he would, according to his children, have become furious.

Mikoyan was defiantly proud of his Armenian identity, and in a 1959 meeting with U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon in Washington, he even raised the issue of the treatment of the Armenians in Turkey. He greatly enjoyed meeting fellow Armenians abroad, including former U.S. ambassador Edward Djerejian. In 1962 K. P. S. Menon described him as Armenia&#x27;s &quot;most famous son&quot;. David Marshall Lang wrote that Mikoyan is an &quot;excellent modern example&quot; of Armenian &quot;toughness and endurance.&quot;

However, in post-Soviet Armenia, Mikoyan&#x27;s legacy is contentious. His critics point to his participation in the 1930s purges in Armenia on the orders of Stalin. His supporters argue that he was a major figure on the global political stage and usually point to his role in defusing the Cuban missile crisis. Others emphasize Mikoyan&#x27;s important role in de-Stalinization in Armenia, including his March 1954 speech in Yerevan and his significant involvement in rehabilitations. Mikoyan&#x27;s contributions to the development of the Soviet Armenian state included support for major economic projects, such as the Arpa–Sevan tunnel. As a Supreme Soviet Deputy for Yerevan, he maintained close ties with Soviet Armenian leaders like Yakov Zarobyan and Anton Kochinyan and regularly consulted with them on Armenian affairs. Although limited in his ability to assist Armenian leaders on Nagorno-Karabakh, he was sympathetic to Armenian concerns, and his son Sergo was later a prominent advocate for the Karabakh movement. Despite his break with the Armenian Church, Mikoyan maintained good relations with Catholicos Vazgen I. He was also a supporter of composer Aram Khachaturian, and counted Marshal Ivan Bagramyan among his personal friends.

Dubbed the Vicar of Bray of politics and known as the &quot;Survivor&quot; during his time, Mikoyan was one of the few Old Bolsheviks who was spared from Stalin&#x27;s purges and was able to retire comfortably from political life. This was highlighted in a number of popular sayings in Russian, including &quot;From Ilyich [Lenin] to Ilyich [Brezhnev] ... without heart attack or stroke!&quot;(&quot;Ot Ilyicha do Ilyicha bez infarkta i paralicha&quot;). One veteran Soviet official described his political career in the following manner: &quot;The rascal was able to walk through Red Square on a rainy day without an umbrella [and] without getting wet. He could dodge the raindrops.&quot;

==Portrayals==
