<text>Udupi () also known as &#x27;Odipu&#x27; () is a city in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is the administrative headquarters of Udupi district, and one of the fastest-growing cities in Karnataka. Udupi is one of the top tourist attractions in Karnataka and has various educational institutions. It is notable for the Krishna Temple and is also known as the temple city. It also lends its name to the popular Udupi cuisine, is also known as Parashurama Kshetra, and is famous for Kanakana kindi. A centre of pilgrimage, Udupi is known as Rajatha Peetha pura

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Udupi&quot; originated from the Sanskrit Word Udupa meaning Moon.

==History==
In the 13th century, Vaishnavite saint Madhvacharya founded the Sri Krishna Temple. He set up eight &quot;mathas&quot; – Ashta Mathas in Udupi to propagate the Dvaita Vedanta philosophy, and this caused a vibrant temple culture to take root in present-day Udupi district. Significant migration of Brahmins to the region took place subsequently, and they came to comprise 10 per cent of the region&#x27;s population, three times higher than elsewhere in South India.

== Demographics ==
Udupi city is part of the eponymous district in Karnataka, India. As per the census in 2011, Udupi city has 33,987 households and a total population of 144,960, of which 71,614 are males and 73,346 are females. The population of scheduled castes is 8,385 while that of scheduled tribes is 6,774. The city population is growing at a rate of 14.03%.

The most spoken language in Udupi town is Tulu. Kannada and Konkani are also spoken in Udupi town.
Dakhini Urdu and Beary are spoken by Muslims in the region.

== Government and politics ==
Udupi city falls under the Udupi Chikmagalur Lok Sabha constituency and the Udupi Chikmagalur State assembly constituency and is represented by the Member of Parliament Kota Srinivas pujari and Member of Legislative Assembly, Yashpal Suvarna.

=== Civic Administration ===
Udupi, which previously had a Town Municipal Council now has a City Municipal Council which came into existence in 1995. Areas around Udupi, such as Manipal, Parkala, Malpe, Udyavara and Santhekatte were merged to form the City Municipal Council.

The city of Udupi is governed by the City Municipal Council and has 35 wards spread across an area of . It is headed by Anand C Kallolikar, the Municipal Commissioner. The city council has departments for health, urban planning, technical division, revenue, finance, birth and death, and Day-NULM.

=== Civic Utility ===
The master plan of the city is prepared by the Udupi Urban Development Authority (UUDA) and the Directorate of Town and Country Planning.

The city receives its primary source of drinking water from water stored at Baje vented dam. The municipality also seeks to augment its water storage by pumping water accumulated in the Swarna River at Sanebettu. The city is divided into three zones with different timings for efficient water supply. It also received a loan of $75 million from the Asian Development Bank to have all round the clock water supply in 2018.

The city has both open and closed drains. The underground sewage network exists in only 20% of the city&#x27;s area as of 2017, but has been proposed to increase from the present 82 kilometres to 143 kilometres. The municipality area generated 46 million litres (MLD) of sewage which is treated at a sewage treatment plant in Nittur.

== Geography and climate ==
Udupi has an elevation of above mean sea level. The climate in Udupi is hot in summers and pleasant in winter. During summers (from March to May) the temperature reaches up to and in winters (from December to February) it is usually between . As it is a coastal area, there are a few beaches which are tourist attractions. Kaup beach, Malpe beach are two of the beaches in Udupi.

The monsoon period is from June to September, with rainfall averaging more than every year and heavy winds.
== Culture ==

Bhuta Kola, Aati kalenja, Karangolu, and Nagaradhane are some cultural traditions of Udupi. The residents celebrate festivals such as Makara Sankranti, Nagara Panchami, Krishna Janmashtami, Ganesh Chaturthi, Navaratri, Deepavali. Folk arts like Yakshagana are also popular.

During Krishna Janmashtami, Pili Yesa, a traditional folk dance originated in Udupi is demonstrated on the streets. &quot;Pili Yesa&quot; translates to Tiger.

== Cuisine ==
The origin of this cuisine is linked to Krishna Matha (Mutt). Lord Krishna is offered food of different varieties every day, and there are certain restrictions on ingredients during Chaturmasa (a four-month period during the monsoon season). These restrictions coupled with the requirement of variety led to innovation, especially in dishes incorporating seasonal and locally available materials. This cuisine was developed by Shivalli Madhwa Brahmins who cooked food for Lord Krishna, and at Krishna Matha in Udupi, the food is provided free of cost. Restaurants specialised in Udupi cuisine can be seen widely in most metropolitan and large cities around the length and breadth of India.

Although popular for its vegetarian cuisine, Udupi has its fair share of non-vegetarian dishes that are similar to Mangalorean cuisine. Some of these include Kori Roti, Kori Pulimunchi, Chicken Sukka, Fish Curry, Fish Fry and more.

== Economy ==
Udupi is becoming a major town in Karnataka. Udupi is the birthplace of the Syndicate Bank, Corporation Bank. Udupi&#x27;s economy also consists of agriculture and fishing. Small-scale industries like the cashew industry, and other food industries and milk cooperatives are the most prominent. Recently, Udupi is also making its mark in the real estate industry, greatly influenced by its neighboring spearhead Mangalore.

The Karnataka government had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Cogentrix Light and Power Industry to set up a thermal power plant in the district at Nandikur. However, because of stiff opposition from citizens and environmentalist groups, the project has been temporarily suspended. An attempt by the Nagarjuna Power Corporation to set up a similar plant at nearby Padubidri also met strong opposition. Now, the power plant has been set up, generating 1,200 MW of power under the name of Udupi Power Corporation Limited (UPCL), a subsidiary of Lanco Infra, an Andhra Pradesh-based infrastructure major. Adani Power has taken over from Lanco Infra in 2014 for a sum of Rs 6,000 crores. The opposition, however, continues.

Manipal, a suburb of Udupi, is home to the headquarters of Syndicate Bank. It is renowned as an education and medical hub. Kasturba Medical College and MIT (Manipal Institute of Technology) are situated here.

TEBMA Shipyards Ltd is located in Malpe harbour complex. It is involved in building multipurpose platform supply vessels (MPSVs), platform supply vessel, geotechnical research vessel, dredgers and tugs for Indian as well as export markets.

Udupi has a local handloom sari industry. Made of pure cotton and lightweight, the sari has art silk design on its border and pallu besides butta of art silk dotting it. Hard work, low returns, and competition from power loom has led to a drop in the number of weavers of nearly 95% over three decades. A geographical indication tag for Udupi sarees is under examination with the Geographical Indications Registry of India.

<doc id="469236" wikidata="Q712796" url="?curid=469236" title="Peter Kay">
<text>Peter John Kay (born 2 July 1973) is an English comedian, actor, writer, and director. He has written, produced, directed and acted in several television and film projects, and has written three books. 

Born and brought up in Farnworth, Kay studied media performance at the University of Salford. He began working part-time as a stand-up comedian, winning the North West Comedian of the Year award. In 1997, he won Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;So You Think You&#x27;re Funny&quot; contest and the following year was nominated for a Perrier Award for his show at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. With his public profile raised, in 2000 he co-wrote and starred in &quot;That Peter Kay Thing&quot; for Channel 4. This resulted in a spin-off sitcom, &quot;Peter Kay&#x27;s Phoenix Nights&quot;, which ran for two series from 2001 to 2002 and in turn generated another spin-off, &quot;Max and Paddy&#x27;s Road to Nowhere&quot;, in 2004. In 2005, he recorded a promotional video in which he mimed to Tony Christie&#x27;s 1971 hit &quot;(Is This the Way to) Amarillo&quot;, which was reissued to raise money for Comic Relief: the song reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming that year&#x27;s best-selling single in the UK.

In 2008, Kay co-wrote and starred in &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice&quot;, a parody of several British reality television shows. As the series&#x27; fictional protagonist Geraldine McQueen, he released the single &quot;The Winner&#x27;s Song&quot;, which reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. His 2010–2011 stand-up comedy tour was recorded in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the most successful ever, selling over 1.2 million tickets. He also provided the voice of police constable (later chief inspector) Albert Mackintosh in two feature-length films of the Wallace &amp; Gromit franchise, &quot;The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Vengeance Most Fowl&quot;. He co-wrote and starred in &quot;Peter Kay&#x27;s Car Share&quot;, a sitcom screened by the BBC for three series from 2015 to 2018. He also starred in the 2015 BBC sitcom &quot;Cradle to Grave&quot;.

In 2016, Kay won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Male Comedy Performance, the BAFTA TV Award for Best Scripted Comedy and the National Television Award for Best Comedy for &quot;Car Share&quot;. He also received an honorary doctorate from the University of Salford.

==Early life and career==
Peter John Kay was born on 2 July 1973 in Farnworth, Lancashire, where he attended Mount Saint Joseph School, leaving with a GCSE in art. 

His father, Michael, was an engineer who died just before Peter&#x27;s career took off. His mother, Deirdre (née O&#x27;Neill), is an Irish Catholic originally from Coalisland, County Tyrone, and Peter was brought up in her faith.

He took several minor jobs, including working in a toilet roll factory, a Netto supermarket, a video rental shop, Manchester Arena, a cash-and-carry, a cinema, a petrol station and a bingo hall, which later inspired episodes for &quot;That Peter Kay Thing&quot;. He was routinely sacked from each, after a few months, for &quot;not taking things seriously&quot;.

He began a degree course at the University of Liverpool in Drama, Theatre Studies and English Literature. He had misinformed the university to accept him, telling the university that he had four GCSEs and A-levels in Psychology and English Literature. Struggling with the course, he changed to studying a Higher National Diploma (HND) in media performance (including stand-up) at the University of Salford&#x27;s Adelphi Campus School of Media, Music and Performance. In recognition of his contribution to the entertainment industry, Kay received an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from Salford University on 19 July 2016, at Salford&#x27;s Lowry Theatre.

He started at the Frog &amp; Bucket, on Oldham Street, from July 1996, whilst his girlfriend worked at Boots.

==Personal life==
In 1998, Kay met Susan Gargan while he was working at the local cinema. They married in 2001 after being in a relationship for three years. The family reside in Bolton but also have a property in Lough Derg, County Tipperary in Ireland.

Kay is teetotal.

==Television career==

Kay&#x27;s first TV project was in a 1997 episode of &quot;New Voices&quot;, a comedy series which showcased rising talent. His episode, &quot;Two Minutes&quot;, written by Johanne McAndrew, saw him play a getaway driver as two of his friends attempted to rob a pub of its takings. In 1997, he played a delivery driver in the BBC drama &quot;Born to Run&quot;.

Also in 1997, he made an appearance on &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as a delivery driver for Fred Elliott&#x27;s corner shop.

In 1998, Kay appeared in a series of sketches for Granada TV&#x27;s &quot;Last Last Show&quot; and &quot;Roy Mills Films of Fun&quot;, where he made his TV debut as a character comedy actor and also did a stand-up set. Neil Fitzmaurice also appeared in the series alongside many other local comedians who Kay later recruited for his Channel 4 series.

After presenting a slot entitled &quot;Peter Kay&#x27;s World of Entertainment&quot; on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;The Sunday Show&quot;, Kay made an episode of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Lab&quot;, &quot;The Services&quot;, in 1998, which won a Royal Television Society award for best newcomer. This served as a pilot for &quot;That Peter Kay Thing&quot;.

Following the series&#x27; success, Kay and his co-writers – Neil Fitzmaurice and Dave Spikey – used the episode &quot;In the Club&quot; as the basis for &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;, which was an immediate hit. Set in a newly refurbished social club run by Brian Potter, the first series was filmed in part at St. Gregory&#x27;s Social Club in Farnworth, Greater Manchester, where the exterior, hallways and function suite were used.

He appeared in the first episode of the 2002 series of &quot;Linda Green&quot;, playing a pizza delivery man who ended up being something of a soulmate to the eponymous heroine. He has had two further roles in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. The first, in the late 1990s, was a brief appearance as a shopfitter, but in January 2004 he co-wrote his scenes, appearing alongside Sally Lindsay, who played Shelley Unwin.

In 2004, Kay followed the success with &quot;Max and Paddy&#x27;s Road to Nowhere&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;. The show featured the bouncer characters from the show—played by Kay and Paddy McGuinness—and at times also featured other characters from &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;. Six episodes were made and broadcast from November to December 2004 by Channel 4. In 2005, Kay was awarded a Rose d&#x27;Or at the international television festival in Montreux for Best Performance by an Actor.

In 2004, Kay began appearing in a series of television adverts for UK brewery John Smith&#x27;s bitter; these imitated the style of &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; and saw Kay develop his catchphrases &quot;&#x27;ave it!&quot; and &quot;two lamb bhunas&quot;. 

On 17 April 2006, Channel 4 broadcast a &quot;Peter Kay Night&quot;, showing out-takes from &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; (previously featured on DVD); a behind-the-scenes documentary, &quot;180 – A Tour Documentary&quot;, which followed Kay behind the scenes of his &quot;Mum Wants a Bungalow&quot; tour; and screened the whole Peter Kay Live in Manchester Arena show.

On 17 June 2006, Kay appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Love &amp; Monsters&quot;. His character, the sinister Victor Kennedy, proved to be an alien called the Abzorbaloff in disguise.

In 2008, he returned to television after an absence of four years with the BAFTA-winning satire of reality talent shows, &quot;Peter Kay&#x27;s Britain&#x27;s Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice&quot;, which he co-wrote with Paul Coleman. The two-hour special was screened on Channel 4 on 17 October 2008.

Kay won his second Royal Television Society award for best actor for playing Geraldine McQueen, a transgender dinner lady from Ireland.

In May 2015 the sitcom &quot;Peter Kay&#x27;s Car Share&quot; was aired. The series was a success and a second series was commissioned to start in April 2017. 
In October 2015, he starred in &quot;Cradle to Grave&quot;, another BBC sitcom based on Danny Baker&#x27;s life as a teenager.

==Film career==

In 2001, he played Cyril the Barman in &quot;Blow Dry&quot;, based on the screenplay &quot;Never Better&quot; by Simon Beaufoy. Kay later admitted he took the part only expecting his scenes to be filmed in Keighley, Bradford, West Yorkshire. However, he was annoyed to discover that his scenes were being filmed in Shoreditch, Greater London.

==Music work==
In 2007, Kay followed the success of &quot;(Is This the Way to) Amarillo&quot; with a cover version of &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot;, originally by the Proclaimers, also for Comic Relief. In 2009, Kay released &quot;The Official BBC Children in Need Medley&quot;, an animation featuring over 100 characters from children&#x27;s television. The video was premiered on BBC1 on 20 November 2009.

Kay returned his support to Comic Relief in March 2011 with a cover version of &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot;, re-recorded by singer Susan Boyle and Kay in the guise of Geraldine McQueen from &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got the Pop Factor&quot;. The video that accompanied the single was also directed by Kay and identically parodied the original video shot for shot.

==Theatre work==
In February 2007, Kay played director Roger DeBris in the Mel Brooks musical &quot;The Producers&quot; at Manchester&#x27;s Palace Theatre for 120 shows.

==Sporadic appearances and hiatus (2017–2022)==

On 9 September 2017, Kay took part in the &quot;We Are Manchester&quot; benefit concert to mark the reopening of Manchester Arena following the terrorist attack in May 2017. He gave a speech to the crowd before introducing the concert&#x27;s headline act, Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds.

In April 2020, Kay featured in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Big Night In&quot; in which he introduced an updated version of &quot;(Is This the Way to) Amarillo&quot;. It marked his first television appearance for two years.

On 2 January 2021, Kay was a guest on BBC Radio 2&#x27;s Saturday morning show, with Cat Deeley hosting this 10am to 1pm programme as Graham Norton had by then left the slot.

In August 2021, Kay performed two sold-out shows at the O2 Apollo Manchester called &#x27;Doing It for Laura&#x27; which had been organised in aid of Laura Nuttall, who was battling an aggressive brain tumour. The tickets for both shows sold out within 30 minutes.

==Comeback (2022–present)==
On 6 November 2022, Kay announced a return to stand-up with a tour beginning in December 2022 and ending in July 2025. Kay returned to TV in December 2024 to voice PC Mackintosh in &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl&quot;, reprising the role from &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot; (2005).

==Stand-up career==

His first stand-up success was in the competition the North West Comedian of the Year, which was held in Manchester and hosted by Dave Spikey, who would later be the co-star and co-writer of &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;. Kay was last on the bill and won the competition, beating Johnny Vegas. Kay has said that he sought a career in comedy. However, he continued to work part-time as an usher at his local cinema in Bolton whilst performing stand-up locally. When the cinema closed, he was presented with the choice of finding another job or moving into comedy full-time.

After he entered and won Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;So You Think You&#x27;re Funny?&quot; contest in 1997, his first semi-professional stand-up appearances were at the 1998 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, where he received a prestigious Perrier Award nomination. During this time, he also appeared at various other clubs, such as London&#x27;s Comedy Store.

Although this led to a certain level of public recognition, it was only after his first live special Live at the Top of the Tower in 2000 that Kay attained mainstream recognition. During this period, he appeared on several chat shows, such as &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; and &quot;Parkinson&quot;, on the latter of which he had previously served as warm-up. It was at this time that production also began on &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;.

In November 2009, after an absence of seven years, Kay announced a return to stand-up with four (later extended to 20) dates at the Manchester Arena the following April with a show entitled The Tour That Doesn&#x27;t Tour Tour...Now On Tour. Demand for tickets caused him to announce soon after that the show would be toured. In January 2012, the tour entered the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the most successful stand-up comedy tour of all time, playing to a total of 1.2 million people.

Kay&#x27;s tour received minor criticism in the press when his disabled fans were hit with bills of up to £39 on premium phone lines booking tour tickets. It was later clarified that this was an issue with the ticket booking services associated with specific venues rather than a matter directly associated with Peter Kay or his production company.

Kay was included in the &quot;Independent on Sunday&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Happy List&quot; in 2009 as &quot;simply Britain&#x27;s best comedian&quot;, and – as an exception to their general rule – was included again in 2010 for also raising funds for Children in Need.

In November 2017, Kay announced his intention to return to stand-up with his first tour in eight years. &quot;Peter Kay Live: Have Gags, Will Travel&quot; was scheduled to begin touring in 2018, beginning with the Genting Arena in April before touring at venues such as SSE Hydro, Manchester Arena, The O2 Arena, First Direct Arena, SSE Arena Belfast, Sheffield Arena and Echo Arena Liverpool. On 13 December 2017, Kay announced that he was cancelling all future work projects (including &quot;Peter Kay Live: Have Gags Will Travel&quot; tour) for family reasons. He had asked that the media respect his and his family&#x27;s privacy. The tour hit criticism again regarding phone calls as fans were charged 62p per minute to call premium rate phone lines to claim ticket refunds.

On 6 November 2022, via an advert during the series 22 premiere of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, Kay announced his first stand-up tour in twelve years, running from 2 December 2022 to 11 August 2023. In solidarity with the current cost of living crisis, Kay stated that tickets would start at £35, matching the price of his previous 2010 tour. Due to demand, additional dates were announced for 2024 and 2025.

==Stand-up tours==
==DVD releases==
In December 2011, it was reported that Kay had sold over 10 million DVDs, a UK record for a comedian and more than the combined sales of best selling films &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;.

==Goodnight Vienna Productions==
Kay and his wife Susan are the two directors of Goodnight Vienna Productions, which co-produces Kay&#x27;s comedy output.

<text>Sir Robert James MacGillivray Neill KC (Hon) (born 24 June 1952) is a British barrister and Conservative Party politician. He served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bromley and Chislehurst from 2006 to 2024. 

He served as a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Communities and Local Government from 14 May 2010 to 4 September 2012. He latterly served as Chair of Parliament&#x27;s Justice Select Committee.

==Biography==
Neill was born in Ilford to John Macgillivray Neill and Elsie May Neill (). Neill attended Abbs Cross Technical High School in Hornchurch. He took his law degree at the London School of Economics and subsequently worked as a barrister specialising in criminal law. 

He was elected as a councillor for Harold Wood ward in the London Borough of Havering at the 1978 election and was subsequently re-elected to Havering London Borough Council in 1982 and 1986, going out of office in 1990. He was elected at a by-election in 1985 to serve as Greater London Council member for Romford, going out of office in 1986.

He stood for the Dagenham parliamentary constituency in 1983, at the age of 30, coming within 2,997 votes of winning the historically Labour seat from Bryan Gould MP. He refought the seat in 1987, coming even closer to winning by slightly cutting the Labour majority to 2,469, but Gould defeated him again. He also stood for election in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1994 and 1998.

Neill was first elected to the London Assembly in the 2000 assembly election, and served as the Conservative member for Bexley and Bromley from 2000 until 2008. He served as Leader of the Conservative Group on the Assembly from 2000 to 2002 and again from 2004.

Between January 2013 and March 2015 he also served as a substitute member on the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. A pro-European, he supported former Conservative Chancellor Kenneth Clarke in both of his bids for the leadership of the Conservative Party.

Neill is a Freemason. Since April 2017, Neill has been a Bencher at the Middle Temple.

Neill was married from 2009 until 2015 to former Southend Conservative Councillor and former Mayor, Daphne White. In July 2018 he married Ann-Louise Whittaker, a music teacher and former opera singer and performer.

==Bromley and Chislehurst by-election==

Following the death of Eric Forth in May 2006, on 3 June 2006 he was adopted as the Conservative candidate for the Bromley and Chislehurst by-election which took place on 29 June 2006. His selection by the local Conservative Association raised eyebrows, as new leader David Cameron had pressed for an &quot;A-List&quot; candidate, to help present Cameron&#x27;s vision of the new Conservative Party. The Parliamentary constituency forms a part of Neill&#x27;s London Assembly constituency. He stated at his selection that he would not resign his London Assembly seat as the resultant by-election, which would see around 400,000 voters go to the polls, would be unduly expensive.

A few questions were raised about Neill&#x27;s position as a non-executive director of the North East London Strategic Health Authority, which fell foul of the House of Commons Disqualification Act of 1975. His response was that, because the body was due to be abolished before he would have had the chance to take his seat in Westminster, any such arguments were immaterial.

Neill won the by-election by just 633 votes, compared to the 13,342 majority achieved by his predecessor at the 2005 general election. Factors contributing to this were assumed by commentators to include a substantial drop in the turnout (down from 64.8 to 40.18%), with the drop disproportionally hitting the Conservative vote; the presence of a high-profile UKIP candidate, Nigel Farage – Labour ended up coming fourth, after UKIP; and a campaign by the Liberal Democrats that heavily focused on Neill personally. In his acceptance speech Neill criticised &quot;a minority of candidates&quot; (which was assumed to be specifically criticising the Liberal Democrat candidate) for their &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks on him. These included statements regarding Neill&#x27;s occupations outside his future parliamentary role (including the nickname &quot;Three Jobs Bob&quot;) and the fact that, at that time, he did not live in the constituency, although he has since purchased a house there.

== In parliament ==
In 2008 Neill was made Shadow Local Government Minister and Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party and was assigned the shadow planning brief from January 2009. He was elected as MP for a second term in the May 2010 election and worked as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Communities and Local Government until September 2012, when he was named Vice Chairman of the Conservative party for Local Government.

Neill&#x27;s approach to statistics and parliamentary privilege has been questioned by Dr Ben Goldacre. Neill claimed local government could save 20% from all services, based on a management consultant&#x27;s estimate of how much could be saved from mobile phone bills.

As of 2008, Neill claims an allowance for a second home outside London, despite his constituency home being only 12 miles from Westminster. A spokesman said that his claims were &quot;in accordance with the rules&quot;.

Neill was re-elected for a third term in May 2015, shortly after which he was elected as Chairman of Parliament&#x27;s Justice Select Committee. Following the General Election on 8 June 2017, he was returned to this role.

Neill was strongly opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum. On 7 February 2017, along with six other Conservative Members of Parliament, he defied the Party whip and voted in favour of New Clause 110 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill. In December 2017, in the same bill, he voted along with fellow Conservative Dominic Grieve and nine other Tory MPs against the government, and in favour of guaranteeing Parliament a &quot;meaningful vote&quot; on any deal Theresa May agrees with Brussels over Brexit.

Neill maintains Legal aid should be more widely available. Neill said in 2018 that cuts to legal aid had gone too far, stating: &quot;The evidence is pretty compelling that changes are needed … We cannot expect people who often have multiple problems in their lives necessarily to be able to resolve such things on their own.&quot;

Neill was knighted in the 2020 New Year Honours for political service.

In September 2020 Neill asked Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis for assurance that the published Internal Market Bill would not breach international law and Lewis admitted that it would do so &quot;in a very specific and limited way.&quot;

In May 2022, following the publication of the Sue Gray report, Neill submitted a letter of no confidence in Prime Minister Johnson calling for his resignation.

Neill was appointed an Honorary King&#x27;s Counsel (KC) on 19 January 2024.

On 1 February 2024 he announced he would not seek re-election at the 2024 general election. This was to spend more time with his wife Ann who suffered a stroke in 2019.

<doc id="469242" wikidata="Q2750636" url="?curid=469242" title="Yutaka Abe">
<text>was a Japanese film director and actor. He went to America along with a younger brother to visit an uncle living in Los Angeles. There he enrolled in an acting school, and upon hearing that Thomas H. Ince was looking for Japanese extras to work in his studios, he applied and was accepted in 1914. He appeared in such films as &quot;The Wrath of the Gods&quot; and &quot;The Cheat&quot; with Sessue Hayakawa. He was often billed as &quot;Jack Abbe&quot; or &quot;Jack Yutake Abbe.&quot; He returned to Japan in 1925, finding work at the Nikkatsu studio, and soon made his debut as a director. Among his early works was the 1926 silent film &quot;The Woman Who Touched the Legs&quot; (Ashi ni sawatta onna), a comedy about a writer and a woman thief. This film, along with most of Abe&#x27;s early work, is now lost. Before and during World War II, Abe directed a number of nationalistic propaganda films including &quot;Moyuru ōzora&quot; (&quot;Flaming Sky&quot;) and &quot;Ano hata o ute&quot; (&quot;Fire on That Flag&quot;).

After the war, he directed the 1950 film adaptation of Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki&#x27;s &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot;, a film which brought him commercial success. His later films include the 1959 satirical comedy &quot;Season of Affairs&quot; (&quot;Uwaki no kisetsu&quot;).

<text>Earl of Halsbury, in the County of Devon, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Halsbury is a historic manor in the parish of Parkham, near Bideford, Devon, long the seat of the Giffard family and sold by them in the 18th. century. The title was created on 19 January 1898 for the lawyer and Conservative politician Hardinge Giffard, 1st Baron Halsbury, and son of Stanley Lees Giffard, the first editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; newspaper. Hardinge Giffard was Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1885 to 1886, 1886 to 1892 and 1895 to 1905, and had already been created Baron Halsbury, of Halsbury in the County of Devon, on 26 June 1885, and was made Viscount Tiverton, of nearby Tiverton, at the same time he was given the earldom. Those titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was descended from the family of Giffard of Brightley, Chittlehampton, a junior line of Gifford of Halsbury. A younger son of the first of the Brightley family was Roger Giffard (d.1603) who purchased Tiverton Castle which he made his home. The 1st Earl in fact had no close connection with Halsbury, as the closest of his ancestors born there was Sir Roger Giffard of Brightley (d.1547) and even less with Tiverton, the home of none of his ancestors but only of a very distant cousin, but nevertheless chose these places as his titles.

The 2nd Earl styled himself &quot;Lord Tiverton&quot; until his succession to the title in 1921, and as a major in the Royal Navy Air Service during World War I produced in September 1917 the first comprehensive plan for strategic bombing that became a major influence for plans and doctrine used by British and American air forces in World War II. Halsbury&#x27;s grandson, the third Earl (who succeeded his father), was a scientist and the first Chancellor of Brunel University, the coat of arms of which to this day includes an element, an ermine lozenge, alluding to the role of the Earl in its founding as a university.

The fourth Earl did not use his title and did not use the courtesy title of Viscount Tiverton which he was entitled to from 1943 to 2000. All the titles became extinct on his death in 2010.

The title of the earldom was pronounced &quot;&quot;Hauls&quot;-bry&quot;.

<doc id="469246" wikidata="Q1096885" url="?curid=469246" title="Lattice (group)">
<text>In geometry and group theory, a lattice in the real coordinate space formula_1 is an infinite set of points in this space with the properties that coordinate-wise addition or subtraction of two points in the lattice produces another lattice point, that the lattice points are all separated by some minimum distance, and that every point in the space is within some maximum distance of a lattice point. Closure under addition and subtraction means that a lattice must be a subgroup of the additive group of the points in the space, and the requirements of minimum and maximum distance can be summarized by saying that a lattice is a Delone set. More abstractly, a lattice can be described as a free abelian group of dimension formula_2 which spans the vector space formula_1. For any basis of formula_1, the subgroup of all linear combinations with integer coefficients of the basis vectors forms a lattice, and every lattice can be formed from a basis in this way. A lattice may be viewed as a regular tiling of a space by a primitive cell.

Lattices have many significant applications in pure mathematics, particularly in connection to Lie algebras, number theory and group theory. They also arise in applied mathematics in connection with coding theory, in percolation theory to study connectivity arising from small-scale interactions, cryptography because of conjectured computational hardness of several lattice problems, and are used in various ways in the physical sciences. For instance, in materials science and solid-state physics, a lattice is a synonym for the framework of a crystalline structure, a 3-dimensional array of regularly spaced points coinciding in special cases with the atom or molecule positions in a crystal. More generally, lattice models are studied in physics, often by the techniques of computational physics.

==Symmetry considerations and examples==
A lattice is the symmetry group of discrete translational symmetry in &quot;n&quot; directions. A pattern with this lattice of translational symmetry cannot have more, but may have less symmetry than the lattice itself. As a group (dropping its geometric structure) a lattice is a finitely-generated free abelian group, and thus isomorphic to formula_5.

A lattice in the sense of a 3-dimensional array of regularly spaced points coinciding with e.g. the atom or molecule positions in a crystal, or more generally, the orbit of a group action under translational symmetry, is a translation of the translation lattice: a coset, which need not contain the origin, and therefore need not be a lattice in the previous sense.

A simple example of a lattice in formula_1 is the subgroup formula_5. More complicated examples include the E8 lattice, which is a lattice in formula_8, and the Leech lattice in formula_9. The period lattice in formula_10 is central to the study of elliptic functions, developed in nineteenth century mathematics; it generalizes to higher dimensions in the theory of abelian functions. Lattices called root lattices are important in the theory of simple Lie algebras; for example, the E8 lattice is related to a Lie algebra that goes by the same name.

==Dividing space according to a lattice==
A lattice formula_11 in formula_1 thus has the form
:formula_13
where {&quot;v&quot;1, ..., &quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot;} is a basis for formula_1. Different bases can generate the same lattice, but the absolute value of the determinant of the vectors &quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot; is uniquely determined by formula_11 and denoted by d(formula_11). If one thinks of a lattice as dividing the whole of formula_1 into equal polyhedra (copies of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional parallelepiped, known as the &quot;fundamental region&quot; of the lattice), then d(formula_11) is equal to the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volume of this polyhedron. This is why d(formula_11) is sometimes called the covolume of the lattice. If this equals 1, the lattice is called unimodular.

==Lattice points in convex sets==
Minkowski&#x27;s theorem relates the number d(formula_11) and the volume of a symmetric convex set &quot;S&quot; to the number of lattice points contained in &quot;S&quot;. The number of lattice points contained in a polytope all of whose vertices are elements of the lattice is described by the polytope&#x27;s Ehrhart polynomial. Formulas for some of the coefficients of this polynomial involve d(formula_11) as well.

==Computational lattice problems==

Computational lattice problems have many applications in computer science. For example, the Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm (LLL) has been used in the cryptanalysis of many public-key encryption schemes, and many lattice-based cryptographic schemes are known to be secure under the assumption that certain lattice problems are computationally difficult.

==Lattices in two dimensions: detailed discussion==

There are five 2D lattice types as given by the crystallographic restriction theorem. Below, the wallpaper group of the lattice is given in IUCr notation, Orbifold notation, and Coxeter notation, along with a wallpaper diagram showing the symmetry domains. Note that a pattern with this lattice of translational symmetry cannot have more, but may have less symmetry than the lattice itself. A full list of subgroups is available. For example, below the hexagonal/triangular lattice is given twice, with full 6-fold and a half 3-fold reflectional symmetry. If the symmetry group of a pattern contains an &quot;n&quot;-fold rotation then the lattice has &quot;n&quot;-fold symmetry for even &quot;n&quot; and 2&quot;n&quot;-fold for odd &quot;n&quot;.
For the classification of a given lattice, start with one point and take a nearest second point. For the third point, not on the same line, consider its distances to both points. Among the points for which the smaller of these two distances is least, choose a point for which the larger of the two is least. (Not logically equivalent but in the case of lattices giving the same result is just &quot;Choose a point for which the larger of the two is least&quot;.)

The five cases correspond to the triangle being equilateral, right isosceles, right, isosceles, and scalene. In a rhombic lattice, the shortest distance may either be a diagonal or a side of the rhombus, i.e., the line segment connecting the first two points may or may not be one of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle. This depends on the smaller angle of the rhombus being less than 60° or between 60° and 90°.

The general case is known as a period lattice. If the vectors p and q generate the lattice, instead of p and q we can also take p and p-q, etc. In general in 2D, we can take &quot;a&quot; p + &quot;b&quot; q and &quot;c&quot; p + &quot;d&quot; q for integers &quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; such that &quot;ad-bc&quot; is 1 or -1. This ensures that p and q themselves are integer linear combinations of the other two vectors. Each pair p, q defines a parallelogram, all with the same area, the magnitude of the cross product. One parallelogram fully defines the whole object. Without further symmetry, this parallelogram is a fundamental parallelogram.
The vectors p and q can be represented by complex numbers. Up to size and orientation, a pair can be represented by their quotient. Expressed geometrically: if two lattice points are 0 and 1, we consider the position of a third lattice point. Equivalence in the sense of generating the same lattice is represented by the modular group: formula_22 represents choosing a different third point in the same grid, formula_23 represents choosing a different side of the triangle as reference side 0–1, which in general implies changing the scaling of the lattice, and rotating it. Each &quot;curved triangle&quot; in the image contains for each 2D lattice shape one complex number, the grey area is a canonical representation, corresponding to the classification above, with 0 and 1 two lattice points that are closest to each other; duplication is avoided by including only half of the boundary. The rhombic lattices are represented by the points on its boundary, with the hexagonal lattice as vertex, and &quot;i&quot; for the square lattice. The rectangular lattices are at the imaginary axis, and the remaining area represents the parallelogrammatic lattices, with the mirror image of a parallelogram represented by the mirror image in the imaginary axis.

==Lattices in three dimensions==

The 14 lattice types in 3D are called Bravais lattices. They are characterized by their space group. 3D patterns with translational symmetry of a particular type cannot have more, but may have less, symmetry than the lattice itself.

==Lattices in complex space==
A lattice in formula_24 is a discrete subgroup of formula_24 which spans formula_26 as a real vector space. As the dimension of formula_26 as a real vector space is equal to formula_28, a lattice in formula_24 will be a free abelian group of rank formula_28.

For example, the Gaussian integers formula_31 form a lattice in formula_32, as formula_33 is a basis of formula_34 over formula_35.

==In Lie groups==

More generally, a lattice Γ in a Lie group &quot;G&quot; is a discrete subgroup, such that the quotient &quot;G&quot;/Γ is of finite measure, for the measure on it inherited from Haar measure on &quot;G&quot; (left-invariant, or right-invariant—the definition is independent of that choice). That will certainly be the case when &quot;G&quot;/Γ is compact, but that sufficient condition is not necessary, as is shown by the case of the modular group in &quot;SL&quot;2(R), which is a lattice but where the quotient isn&#x27;t compact (it has &quot;cusps&quot;). There are general results stating the existence of lattices in Lie groups.

A lattice is said to be uniform or cocompact if &quot;G&quot;/Γ is compact; otherwise the lattice is called non-uniform.

==Lattices in general vector spaces==

While we normally consider formula_36 lattices in formula_1 this concept can be generalized to any finite-dimensional vector space over any field. This can be done as follows:

Let &quot;K&quot; be a field, let &quot;V&quot; be an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional &quot;K&quot;-vector space, let formula_38 be a &quot;K&quot;-basis for &quot;V&quot; and let &quot;R&quot; be a ring contained within &quot;K&quot;. Then the &quot;R&quot; lattice formula_39 in &quot;V&quot; generated by &quot;B&quot; is given by:

:formula_40

In general, different bases &quot;B&quot; will generate different lattices. However, if the transition matrix &quot;T&quot; between the bases is in formula_41 - the general linear group of &quot;R&quot; (in simple terms this means that all the entries of &quot;T&quot; are in &quot;R&quot; and all the entries of formula_42 are in &quot;R&quot; - which is equivalent to saying that the determinant of &quot;T&quot; is in formula_43 - the unit group of elements in &quot;R&quot; with multiplicative inverses) then the lattices generated by these bases will be isomorphic since &quot;T&quot; induces an isomorphism between the two lattices.

Important cases of such lattices occur in number theory with &quot;K&quot; a &quot;p&quot;-adic field and &quot;R&quot; the &quot;p&quot;-adic integers.

For a vector space which is also an inner product space, the dual lattice can be concretely described by the set

:formula_44

or equivalently as

:formula_45

<doc id="469247" wikidata="Q4758237" url="?curid=469247" title="Andrew Pelling">
<text>Andrew John Pelling (born 20 August 1959) is a British politician. He was Member of Parliament for Croydon Central from 2005 to 2010, first as a Conservative, then from 2007 as an independent. He contested the seat as an independent at the 2010 general election, but lost to his former party.

He was also a councillor in Croydon and a member of the London Assembly. He joined the Labour Party in February 2011 but was subsequently expelled from Labour in February 2022. In early 2024 he joined the Liberal Democrats, and stood unsuccessfully for the party in the 2024 general election.

== Education and local government ==
Pelling and his family have lived in Croydon for six generations. He was educated at Trinity School, Croydon and then New College, Oxford, where he led the Oxford University Conservative Association. He was elected to the position of Librarian of the Oxford Union, a senior position, and ran for President several times without being elected, on one occasion losing to William Hague. Before becoming a full-time politician, Pelling was an international investment banker.

He was elected to Croydon Council in 1982 in Broad Green ward and later represented the ward of Heathfield. He served as Chair, first of the Education Committee in the early 1990s and subsequently became Deputy Leader of the Conservative Group when they lost control of the Council in 1994. From 2002 until 2005, he was the leader of the Conservative group in Croydon and stepped down from the Council in 2006 after 24 years.

Pelling was first elected to the London Assembly in 2000, and retained his seat in 2004. He was a member of the London Development Agency and chaired the GLA budget committee.

== Political career ==

At the 2005 general election, Pelling won the Croydon Central parliamentary seat by 75 votes, beating the incumbent, Labour&#x27;s Geraint Davies.

On 28 May 2007 Pelling was one of 18 Conservative MPs to vote in favour of an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act proposed by David Maclean, which would have seen the Houses of Parliament and MPs exempted from the disclosure requirements of the Act. However, he was 625th out of 646 MPs in the expenses league table and did not take a second-home allowance.

On 18 September 2007 Pelling was arrested on suspicion of assaulting his wife Lucy after the Metropolitan Police received a complaint. He was released on bail later that night after being questioned. The police later announced that no charges were to be made against Pelling nor would the Crown Prosecution Service prosecute. The allegations caused the Conservatives to remove the whip, suspending him from the party.

In December 2007, Pelling announced that he would not seek re-election for Parliament nor the London Assembly, but he subsequently decided to contest the Croydon Central seat as an independent, saying &quot;I am very much up for representing Croydon for another term, there are lots of important issues to speak about.&quot; He said that as an independent, he had the political freedom to best serve Croydon.

He has been quoted in 2010 as saying &quot;Independence has allowed me to do politics differently, enabling me to put Croydon residents ahead of party politics and to lobby effectively for Croydon by being non-partisan. I do not have to obey party bosses and so can speak out for Croydon and on issues like immigration, an EU membership referendum and foolish overseas wars that the parties prefer not to speak of.&quot;

According to Pelling&#x27;s own website, &quot;The Leader of London&#x27;s Green Party once called me &#x27;the acceptable face of Conservatism&#x27;.&quot;

As an independent Pelling lost his seat to the Conservatives at the 2010 general election obtaining 6.5% of the vote in Croydon Central. He remained active in political circles, and attended the 2010 Labour Party Conference in Manchester. By 2011 Pelling had joined the Labour Party. In June 2013 it was announced Pelling would contest the marginal seat of Waddon in the upcoming Croydon Council elections. He was elected to Croydon Council on 22 May 2014.

In February 2022, Andrew Pelling was expelled from the Labour Party for leaks to the press, campaigning for a directly-elected mayor, and voting against the party on council tax cuts.

In the fourth episode of the Al Jazeera documentary &quot;The Labour Files&quot; it was revealed that much of the evidence used to prove Andrew Pelling had been leaking to the press was obtained through hacking the blog &quot;Inside Croydon&quot; with the knowledge of Labour staff.

In March 2024, Pelling switched party allegiance to the Liberal Democrats. Describing the Conservatives as out of touch with their &#x27;one nation&#x27; roots, angered by their culture wars and believing that Britain was best suited inside Europe. Pelling was selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate in the new seat of Croydon East for the 2024 general election. 

==Personal life==
Pelling was married to Sanae for 16 years, and the couple had three children. In 2006, Pelling married Lucy. They have since separated after allegations of assault.

<text>The following is a list of seaplanes, which includes [[floatplane]]s and [[flying boat]]s. A seaplane is any airplane that has the capability of landing and taking off from water, while an [[amphibious aircraft|amphibian]] is a seaplane which can also operate from land. (They do not include rotorcraft, or ground-effect vehicles which can only skim along close to the water)

A flying boat relies on its main hull for buoyancy, while a floatplane has a conventional aircraft fuselage fitted with external floats. In some locales, the term &quot;seaplane&quot; is used as a synonym for floatplane.

==List==
A small number of seaplanes have retractable beaching gear, which is not capable of being used for landings and takeoffs, but these remain flying boats or floatplanes and are not amphibians.

Many floatplanes, especially those since 1945, can have either conventional floats for operating just from water, or amphibious floats, which have retractable undercarriage built into them.

Some experimental flying boats have used skis or hydrofoils to supplement their buoyancy when in motion, however they still rely on the buoyancy of a hull when they are not moving fast enough to lift out of the water.

He was the author of more than 30 books and more than 2,000 stories and essays and is most famous for his short story &quot;Pigs Is Pigs&quot;, in which a bureaucratic stationmaster insists on levying the livestock rate for a shipment of two pet guinea pigs, which soon start proliferating exponentially. His most famous character was Philo Gubb.

His career spanned more than forty years, and his stories, poems, and articles were published in more than 225 magazines. His work appeared alongside that of his contemporaries, including Mark Twain, Sax Rohmer, James B. Hendryx, Berton Braley, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Don Marquis, Will Rogers, and Edgar Rice Burroughs.

Despite the enormous volume of his work, Butler was, for most of his life, only a part-time author. He worked full-time as a banker and was very active in his local community. A founding member of both the Dutch Treat Club and the Authors League of America, Butler was an always-present force in the New York City literary scene.

==Early life and education==
Butler was born in Muscatine, Iowa, on December 5, 1869. He attended Muscatine High School for one year.

== Career ==
He moved to New York City and lived in Flushing (Queens) New York.

He wrote twenty-five stories for &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot; between 1906 and 1935. The stories in the &quot;Companion&quot; were illustrated by artists including May Wilson Preston, Frederic Dorr Steele, Herbert Paus and Rico Le Brun.

Between 1931 and 1936, at least seventeen of Butler&#x27;s stories published in newspapers were illustrated by Ethel Hays.

== Personal life and death ==
He died in Williamsville, Massachusetts on September 13, 1937, and was interred in Flushing Cemetery.

<text>Maa Kheru () is a phrase meaning &quot;true of voice&quot; or &quot;justified&quot; or &quot;the acclaim given to him is &#x27;right&#x27;&quot;. The term is involved in ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs, according to which deceased souls had to be judged morally righteous. Once the soul had passed the test, the Weighing of the Heart, they were judged to be &quot;mꜣꜥ ḫrw&quot; and was allowed to enter the afterlife. 

The phrase was often used to denote someone who had died and become a god, placed after the name of the individual in question. As such, it is frequently found in inscriptions in Egyptian tombs and royal mortuary temples, especially as part of an introductory clause for autobiographical inscriptions celebrating the tomb or temple owner&#x27;s achievements in life.

<text>The North Cascades are a section of the Cascade Range of western North America. They span the border between the Canadian province of British Columbia and the U.S. state of Washington and are officially named in the U.S. and Canada as the Cascade Mountains. The portion in Canada is known to Americans as the Canadian Cascades, a designation that also includes the mountains above the east bank of the Fraser Canyon as far north as the town of Lytton, at the confluence of the Thompson and Fraser Rivers.

They are predominantly non-volcanic, but include the stratovolcanoes Mount Baker, Glacier Peak and Coquihalla Mountain, which are part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc.

==Geography==

The U.S. section of the North Cascades and the adjoining Skagit Range in British Columbia are most notable for their dramatic scenery and challenging mountaineering, both resulting from their steep, rugged topography. While most of the peaks are under in elevation, the low valleys provide great local relief, often over . The summits of the rest of the Canadian Cascades are not glaciated in the same way and feature rock &quot;horns&quot; rising from plateau-like uplands, with the Manning Park and Cathedral Park areas known for their extensive alpine meadows, as is also the case with the eastern flank of the US portion of the range. Portions of the US side of the range are protected as part of North Cascades National Park.
The large amount of precipitation, much of it in the form of snow, and the resulting glaciation, combine with the regional uplift to create a dramatic landscape in the western part of the range. Deep, U-shaped valleys carved by glaciers in Pleistocene time separate sharp ridges and peaks carved into steep shapes by more recent snow and ice.

The eastern and northernmost parts of the range are much more plateau-like in character, though in the case of the northernmost areas graven by deep valleys along the flank of the Fraser Canyon, notably that of the Anderson River.

===Extent===

The Fraser River and the adjoining lowland on its south bank form the northern and northwestern boundary of the range. On the east, the Okanogan River and the Columbia River bound the range in the United States, while the northeastern boundary of the range departs the Thompson via the Nicoamen River and runs via Lawless Creek, the Tulameen River and Copper Creek to the Similkameen River. On the west, the foothills of the range are separated by a narrow coastal plain from Puget Sound except along Chuckanut Drive between Bellingham and Mount Vernon, where they abut the Sound directly.
The southern boundary of the North Cascades is less definite. For the purposes of this article, it will be taken as U.S. Highway 2, running over Stevens Pass, or equivalently, the Skykomish River, Nason Creek, and the lower Wenatchee River. This roughly follows Beckey&#x27;s geologic division in &quot;Cascade Alpine Guide&quot; and the definition used by Peakbagger.com. Sometimes the southern boundary is defined by Snoqualmie Pass and the approximate route of Interstate 90. Sometimes the term &quot;North Cascades&quot; or &quot;northern Cascades&quot; is used for the entire range north of the Columbia River.

Geologically, the rocks of the North Cascades extend south beyond Stevens Pass and west into the San Juan Islands. The significance of the geologic transitions to the Okanagan Highland to the east and the Interior Plateau and Coast Mountains to the north are less agreed upon.

===Climate===
The climate in the North Cascades varies considerably by location and elevation. The western slope of the range is wet and cool, with of precipitation per year. This produces a temperate rain forest climate in the low valleys, which then grades into montane and alpine climates on mountain slopes and peaks. Summers are comparatively dry, with far less precipitation than in winter; sometimes the warmer eastern air and cooler western air meet at the Cascades during the summer months, and form thunderstorms. Sometimes, the storms move downwind into lowland cities. The eastern slope lies in the rain shadow of the range, since prevailing winds and most moisture come from the west, and hence is significantly drier than the western side of the main divide, becoming semi-arid in the eastern lowlands. As with most mountainous areas, precipitation increases dramatically with increasing elevation. As a result, there is a great deal of winter snow and glaciation in the high North Cascades.

The eastern slopes and mountain passes can receive significant snowfall. Cold Arctic air can flow south from British Columbia through the Okanogan River valley into the bowl-like basin east of the Cascades. Cold air damming causes this Arctic air to bank up along the eastern Cascade slopes, especially into the lower passes, such as Snoqualmie Pass and Stevens Pass. The milder, Pacific-influenced air moving east over the Cascades is often forced aloft by the cold air held in place in the passes due to cold air damming. As a result, the passes often receive more snow than higher areas in the Cascades. This effect makes the relatively low elevation ski resorts at Snoqualmie Pass (about ) and Stevens Pass (about ) possible.

The following peaks are notable for their large, steep rise above local terrain. Peaks are listed in descending order by elevation.


==Highest waterfalls==

The North Cascades are known for having many extremely tall glacial-fed waterfalls; the ten highest measured waterfalls are listed.

Many tall waterfalls occur where meltwater from mountain glaciers drop down a headwall, which are common occurrences in the North Cascades. Many waterfalls, despite their great height, are non-notable as they are not clearly visible and often have low volume. Seahpo Peak Falls, despite its great height at nearly , is an example of one of these waterfalls. A few notable exceptions do occur; Sulphide Creek Falls occurs where meltwaters from two of the largest Mount Shuksan glaciers are forced through a narrow chute over a headwall at the head of Sulphide Valley.

==Geology==
The bulk of the North Cascades consists of &quot;deformed and metamorphosed, structurally complex pre-Tertiary rocks&quot;. These originated in diverse locations around the globe: the area is built of several (&quot;perhaps ten or more&quot;) different terranes of different ages and origins. These terranes are separated by a series of ancient faults, the most significant being the Straight Creek Fault, which runs north–south from north of Yale, British Columbia, through Hope, Marblemount, Washington, and down to Kachess Lake near Snoqualmie Pass. There is evidence of significant strike-slip movement on this fault in the past, with similar rocks on either side of the fault separated by dozens of miles. This is thought to be related to northward tectonic movement of the West Coast relative to the rest of North America.

Since about 35 million years ago, oceanic crust from the Pacific Ocean has been subducting under the continental margin, which has formed the current volcanoes as well as a number of igneous intrusions composed of diorite and gabbro. The current uplift of the Cascade Range began around 8 million years ago.
Rocks similar to those in the North Cascades continue north to the vicinity of Mount Meager massif in the Coast Mountains, where they abut the Stikinia Terrane of the Omineca-Intermontane Province that dominates the Interior Plateau of British Columbia. This geologic similarity between the North Cascades and Coast Mountains results in a fairly arbitrary boundary between the two.

In British Columbia, the western geologic boundary of the North Cascades is defined as the Fraser River as it follows the Straight Creek Fault, while in the United States the western boundary is defined by the Puget Lowlands in the west, although there are significant westward extensions of rocks similar in origin to those in the North Cascades found in the San Juan Islands.

The eastern geologic boundary of the North Cascades may be marked by the Chewack-Pasayten Fault. This fault separates the easternmost portion of the North Cascades, the Methow Terrane, from the Quesnellia Terrane, one of the Omineca and Intermontane Belts. The fault also separates the Methow River valley, part of the Methow Terrane, from the Okanagan Range, part of the Quesnellia Terrane. The Columbia River Basalt Group bounds the North Cascades to the southeast.

The southern limit of what is geologically considered the &quot;North Cascades&quot; may variously be defined as being the southern limit of exposure of igneous and metamorphic terranes which is generally north of Snoqualmie Pass, Snoqualmie Pass itself, or Naches Pass at the White River Fault Zone.

===Glaciers===
While alpine glaciers are a defining feature of the Cascade Range as a whole, this is especially true of the North Cascades. The stratovolcanoes (Mount Baker and Glacier Peak) are the most obviously glaciated peaks and have the largest glaciers, but many of the smaller, nonvolcanic peaks are glaciated as well. For example, the portion of the Cascades north of Snoqualmie Pass (roughly the North Cascades as defined in this article) These glaciers all retreated from 1900 to 1950. From 1950 to 1975 many but not all North Cascades glaciers advanced. Since 1975 retreat has become more rapid with all 107 glaciers monitored retreating by 1992. 2015 was an especially damaging year for Cascadian Glaciers, an estimated mass loss of five to ten percent, the single greatest loss in over 50 years. There are approximately 700 glaciers in the range, though some have already disappeared. Since a brief advancing period in the 1950s, most of these glaciers have been retreating. This is a serious concern to water managers in the region, as the glaciers (and the winter snowpack) form a large reservoir of water. As snow and ice melts in the summer, the resulting meltwater compensates for the seasonal decrease in precipitation. As glaciers retreat they will provide less summer runoff.

The Cascades north of Snoqualmie Pass have 756 glaciers covering of terrain. For comparison, the entire contiguous United States has about 1,100 glaciers in total, covering .

==Ecology==

The North Cascades has a diversity of plant species. It contains more than 1630 vascular plant species There are eight distinct life zones that support thousands of plants separately and in their own way. Traveling west to east through the range, one would intersect a number of distinct ecoregions, first getting higher and colder, then getting warmer, yet drier. Each of these component ecoregions can be described by either a tree indicator species, or by a lack of trees: Western hemlock, silver fir, subalpine mountain hemlock, Alpine tundra, subalpine fir, and grand fir/Douglas-fir.

The range also has a rich diversity of animals, including bald eagles, wolves, grizzly bears, mountain lions and black bears. The range is home to at least 75 species of mammals and 200 species of birds that either pass through or use the North Cascades for a breeding area. There are also 11 species of fish on the west side of the Cascades. Examples of amphibian species occurring in the North Cascades include the western toad (&quot;Bufo boreas&quot;) and the rough-skinned newt (&quot;Taricha granulosa&quot;).

The biodiversity of the area is threatened by global climate change and invasive exotic plant species. These exotic plants thrive by utilizing manmade structures such as roads and trails. These invasive plants include the diffuse knapweed (&quot;Centaurea diffusa&quot;) and reed canary grass (&quot;Phalaris arundinacea&quot;).

==History==

On the United States side of the border, early inhabitants of the North Cascades included the Nooksack, Skagit, and Sauk-Suiattle tribes on the west, and the Okanagan people on the eastern side, with the Nlaka&#x27;pamux people of what is now Canada claiming hunting territory in the heart of the range, south across the border into Washington. The tribes living and using the range on the Canadian side of the border are the Nlaka&#x27;pamux, and the Upper and Lower Similkameen subgroups of the Okanagan. A now-extinct group known as the Nicola Athapaskans also inhabited and hunted in the area now occupied by the Similkameen. Many current geographic names in the region are derived from native terms, either by transliteration or translation. Beckey notes that &quot;Many names were derived from Chinook Jargon, mostly applied by the United States Forest Service from 1910 to 1940...&quot;
Fur traders entered the area in the first half of the 19th century, coming from Canada and from Astoria on the Columbia River. One of the earliest was Alexander Ross of the North West Company, who crossed the range in the summer of 1814, probably via Cascade Pass. The period of uncertainty surrounding the disputed Oregon Country gave way following partition along the 49th Parallel to a period of tentative U.S. Army exploration in tandem with violent subjugation of Indian tribes on the American side of the frontier in the second half of the century. With the partition, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was forced to seek an alternative to its older Brigade Trail via the Okanogan River and the construction of a new route over the northern spine of the Canadian Cascades from the area of Spuzzum into the valley of the Coldwater River to connect fort Langley on the lower Fraser with its northern posts in New Caledonia. The route was impracticable and was soon abandoned, though more southerly routes through what is now Manning Park laid the foundations for later routes such as the Dewdney Trail and the modern Crowsnest Highway via Allison Pass, and was later similar to a route via the Coquihalla Pass for its southern mainline. South of the boundary, reconnaissance for possible railroad routes (none of which were viable north of the one eventually put in over Stevens Pass, at the southern edge of the North Cascades) and various mining rushes.

Miners dominated the exploration and development of the range from the 1880s through the early 20th century. For example, mines around the boomtown of Monte Cristo, in the southwest portion of the North Cascades, produced &quot;between $1 and $2.7 million in silver and gold&quot;. The Holden Mine, on the east side of the main divide, produced 106,000 tons of copper and 600,000 ounces of gold. Discovery of gold by American prospectors on the banks of the Thompson River at its confluence with the Nicoamen River, at the northern tip of the range, helped trigger the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858–1860 which in turn prompted the declaration of the Colony of British Columbia to affirm British possession of territories north of the 49th Parallel. The Fraser rush led to exploration of the Cascades to the east of the canyon and in the valley of the Similkameen River, with minor rushes in the area of Princeton, British Columbia in 1859 through the early 1860s and the creation of non-native towns (on top of much older native ones) at Boston Bar, Lytton and Hope, as well as Princeton.

Early settlers also arrived in the foothills of the North Cascades in the latter half of the 19th century, and utilized the range in a limited way as a source of timber and grazing land. The range is so rugged that this exploitation was less dramatic than in other more gentle landscapes.

Early recreational use of the range included expeditions by the local climbing clubs, The Mountaineers and The Mazamas. These groups did not fully explore the inner reaches of the range and ascend the most difficult peaks until the 1930s and 1940s. It was not until the 1970s, that most peaks were climbed in the most isolated areas, making it one of the last explored ranges in the contiguous United States.

==Climbing==

The North Cascades are often referred as the &quot;American Alps&quot; by hikers, climbers and mountaineers because of the sea of steep, jagged peaks that span across the range. This range&#x27;s rugged approaches and exceptional alpine terrain make it a premiere training ground for mountain climbers.

== Protected areas ==

<text>In Libya there are currently 106 districts, second level administrative subdivisions known in Arabic as &quot;baladiyat&quot; (singular &quot;baladiyah&quot;). The number has varied since 2013 between 99 and 108. The first level administrative divisions in Libya are currently the governorates (&quot;muhafazat&quot;), which have yet to be formally delineated, but which were originally tripartite as: Tripolitania in the northwest, Cyrenaica in the east, and Fezzan in the southwest; and later divided into ten governorates.

Prior to 2013 there were twenty-two first level administrative subdivisions known by the term shabiyah (Arabic singular &quot;šaʿbiyya&quot;, plural &quot;šaʿbiyyāt&quot;) which constituted the districts of [[Libya]]. In the 1990s the shabiyat had replaced an older baladiyat system.

Historically the area of Libya was considered three provinces (or states), Tripolitania in the northwest, Cyrenaica in the east, and Fezzan in the southwest. It was the conquest by Italy in the Italo-Turkish War that united them in a single political unit. Under the Italians Libya was eventually divided into four provinces and one territory: Tripoli, Misrata, Benghazi, Derna, (in the north) and the Territory of the Libyan Sahara (in the south). After the French and British occupied Libya in 1943, it was again split into three provinces: Tripolitania in the northwest, Cyrenaica in the east, and Fezzan-Ghadames in the southwest.

Article 176 of the 1951 constitution of Libya stated &quot;The Kingdom of Libya shall be divided into administrative units in conformity with the law to be promulgated in this connection. Local and regional councils may be formed in the Kingdom. The extent of these units shall be determined by law which shall likewise organize these Councils.&quot; in exact quote.

After independence (1951), Libya was divided into three governorates (&quot;muhafazat&quot;), matching the three provinces of before, but in 1963 it was divided into ten governorates. In 1983 a new system was introduced dividing the country into forty-six districts (&quot;baladiyat&quot;). In 1987 this was reduced to twenty-five districts.

On 2 August 1995, Libya reorganized into thirteen districts (&quot;shabiyat&quot;). In 1998 this was increased to 26 shabiyat districts. In 2001 it was increased to thirty-two districts plus three administrative regions. Finally in 2007 it was reduced to twenty-two districts.

For historical evolution see also: Subdivisions of Libya.

Libyan districts were further subdivided into Basic People&#x27;s Congresses which act as townships or boroughs until 2011.

==Etymology==
The term in Arabic can mean both &quot;popularity&quot; or &quot;That that is of the people&quot; or more simply &quot;pertaining to the people&quot;. The second meaning was used by the Libyan government to refer to the districts of Libya, in tandem with the general ideology of the state. Sha&#x27;biyat in Libya are the highest administrative level. A lower level, equivalent to a county, exists and divides each Shabiyah into smaller entities.

The term was new and exclusive to Libya, in line with exclusive terms for republic (jamahiriya), ministry (amanah) and embassy (people&#x27;s-bureau)—all of which are different from what is used throughout Arabic-speaking countries, including even Libya itself before its adoption of the neology.

==Districts (&quot;Shabiya&quot;)==
&quot;Shabiyah&quot; ( &quot;šaʿbiyyah&quot;, plural: &quot;šaʿbiyyāt&quot;) is a neologism exclusive to Libya under Gaddafi, in line with exclusive terms for republic (jamahiriya), ministry (amanah) and embassy (people&#x27;s-bureau).
The term basically means a district, that is, a top level administrative division. Etymologically, it is an adjective meaning &quot;of or pertaining to the people, popular&quot;.

=== 22 districts (2007) ===
In 2007 the twenty-two districts (&quot;shabiya&quot;) replaced the older thirty-two district system.

The list is as following:

===32 districts (2001)===
The 2001 reorganization of Libya into districts (&quot;shabiya&quot;) resulted in thirty-two districts and three administrative regions (المنطقة الإدارية): 

The three administrative regions are missing from the above map, Qatrun, Marada, and Jaghbub

===26 districts (1998)===
In 1998 Libya was reorganized into twenty-six districts which were: Butnan, Jafara, Jufra, Kufra, Marj, Murqub, Quba, Al Wahat, Bani Walid, Benghazi, Derna, Gharyan, Jabal al Akhdar, Murzuq, Misrata, Nalut, Nuqat al Khams, Sabha, Sabrata/Sorman, Sirte, Tarhuna/Msalata, Tripoli, Wadi al Hayaa, Wadi al Shatii, Yafran, and Zawiya

===13 districts (1995)===
On 2 August 1995 Libya dropped the baladiyat system and reorganized into thirteen districts (&quot;shabiyat&quot;). Among them were Butnan (formerly Tobruk), Jabal al Akhdar, Jabal al Gharbi, Zawiya, Benghazi, and Tripoli. However, there is not agreement about the other seven names.

==Former &quot;baladiya&quot; ==
&quot;Baladiyah&quot; (singular) or &quot;baladiyat&quot; (plural), are Arabic words used in many Arab countries to denote administrative divisions of the country. In Libya, the baladiyat system of districts was introduced in 1983 to replace the governorate system. Originally there were forty-six baladiyat districts, but in 1988 that number was reduced to twenty-five baladiyat. The table hereunder lists the old twenty-five baladiyat in alphabetical order with a link to each one and numbered to be located on the map. Note that each district linked may be both a baladiyah and a shabiyah. The many changes may not always be reflected in the article.

For 1995 data, [4] and [5] are the two different sources mentioned in the bibliography: &quot;The Europa World Year Book 2001&quot; and &quot;Ershiyi (21) Shiji Shijie Diming Lu&quot;, Beijing, 2001.

For 1988, name is provided if different from nowadays. As said above, AR stands for the three &quot;Administrative Region&quot; of 2001.

Fazzan wasn&#x27;t strictly a district, but a historical muhafazah or wilayah along with Tripolitania (capital Tripoli) and Cyrenaica (capital Cyrene -near nowadays Shahhat- with Diocletian, moved to Ptolemais after the earthquake of 365, and to Barce -nowadays Barca- with Omer Bin Khattab in 643).

<doc id="469263" wikidata="Q24165" url="?curid=469263" title="Helene Hayman, Baroness Hayman">
<text>Helene Valerie Hayman, Baroness Hayman, ( Middleweek; born 26 March 1949) is a British politician who was Lord Speaker of the House of Lords in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. As a member of the Labour Party she was a Member of Parliament from 1974 to 1979. When she became an MP at age 25, she was the youngest MP of the 1974–79 Parliament. Hayman became a life peer in 1996.

Outside politics, she has been involved in health issues, serving on medical ethics committees and the governing bodies of bodies in the National Health Service and health charities. In 2006, she won the inaugural election for the newly created position of Lord Speaker.

==Early life, education and early career==
The daughter of Maurice (a dentist) and Maude Middleweek, Hayman attended Wolverhampton Girls&#x27; High School and read law at Newnham College, Cambridge, graduating in 1969; she was President of the Cambridge Union Society in 1969. She worked for Shelter from 1969 to 1971, and for the Social Services Department at the London Borough of Camden from 1971 to 1974, when she was named Deputy Director of the National Council for One-Parent Families.

==Personal life==
She married Martin Heathcote Hayman (born 20 December 1942) in 1974; they have four sons.

==Political career==
She participated on William F. Buckley&#x27;s &quot;Firing Line&quot; television programs in January 1972 as a member of a panel discussing &quot;The Irish Problem&quot; and featuring then-MP Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, and on 24 July 1973 in an episode discussing whether the Apollo program had been worth it, and again on the 20 August 1973 episode with Malcolm Muggeridge on the theme &quot;Has America Had It?&quot;. In February 1973 she was one of three commenters on an episode of &quot;Firing Line&quot; which featured Germaine Greer.

She contested the Wolverhampton South West constituency in the February 1974 election. She was elected as the Member of Parliament for Welwyn and Hatfield in the October 1974 general election. On her election, she was the youngest member of the House of Commons, remaining the &quot;Baby of the House&quot; until the by-election victory of Andrew MacKay in 1977. She was the first woman to breastfeed at Westminster. She lost her seat, a marginal, to the Conservative Christopher Murphy at the 1979 general election.

She was a member of the Bloomsbury Health Authority (later Bloomsbury and Islington Health Authority) from 1985 to 1992, and its Vice-Chair from 1988 onwards.
She served on the ethics committees of the Royal College of Gynaecologists from 1982 to 1997, and of the University College London and University College Hospital from 1987 to 1997. From 1992 to 1997, she was a member of the Council of University College, London, and chair of Whittington Hospital NHS Trust.

Hayman was made a life peer on 2 January 1996, and took the title Baroness Hayman, of Dartmouth Park in the London Borough of Camden. After the Labour Party won the 1997 general election, she served as a junior minister in the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Department of Health, before being appointed Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in July 1999.

She became a member of the Privy Council in 2001, but left political office the same year to become chairman of Cancer Research UK (2001–2005). She became chair of the Human Tissue Authority in 2005. She was a Trustee of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (2002–2006) and of the Tropical Health and Education Trust (2005–2006). She was a member of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in 2005–2006. She was a member of the Lords Select Committee on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill, 2004–2005, and of the Lords Constitution Committee, 2005–2006.

==Lord Speaker==
In May 2006, after the position of Speaker in the House of Lords was separated from the office of Lord Chancellor as part of the reforms under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, she was one of nine candidates to be put forward for the new role of Lord Speaker. She was nominated as a candidate by Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean and seconded by Lord Walton of Detchant. Her narrow victory in the election was announced on 4 July 2006 and she became the first ever Lord Speaker. On her election, Lord McNally, the Liberal Democrat leader in the House of Lords, called her the &quot;Julie Andrews of British politics&quot;. Like the Speaker in the House of Commons, but unlike the Lord Chancellor who was also a judge and a government minister, the Lord Speaker resigns party membership and outside interests to concentrate on being an impartial presiding officer. 

On 2 March 2011, Hayman gave a lecture to the Mile End Group in the Attlee Suite of Portcullis House. This was the third in a lecture series to commemorate the Parliament Act 1911. On 9 May 2011, Hayman announced that she would not seek re-election for a second term as Lord Speaker; her successor was Baroness D&#x27;Souza.

<doc id="469265" wikidata="Q1931951" url="?curid=469265" title="Midgard (role-playing game)">
<text>Midgard is a fantasy role-playing game from Germany. It was the first role-playing game published in German and the first to be created in Germany.

Midgard is also the name of the world on which the game is usually played (originally named Magira but later renamed due to legal problems). However, the rules of the game are designed in a way that makes it possible to play Midgard on nearly every world.

Despite its name, the game doesn&#x27;t have anything in common with the mythological Midgard.

== Game mechanics ==
&quot;Midgard&quot;, in its 1985 edition, was the first role-playing game that had a system which separated action points (AP) from hit points (HP). While the number of action points increases with the character&#x27;s level, hit points usually remain constant. This has the effect that experienced characters can fight longer and cast more spells, but a direct hit can still inflict serious damage.

The characters in Midgard have levels (called &quot;degrees&quot;) that are used in regards to how much the character has learned in their life. It is rarely used as a prerequisite for learning something. Action points and base attributes, determined by dice (a D100), may also be increased by using experience points.

There are 15 character classes, and the class a player picks will determine how difficult it is for a character to learn a skill. Most skills can be learned by almost every class, but some classes may not benefit from learning certain skills; a Warrior can learn spell casting, but their strength attribute is higher than their intellect attribute (spell casting).

For dice, the system uses a d100 (usually replaced by two d10), a d20, the classic d6 and, since the latest edition, also the d3 (the number indicates the side number of the dice. See game dice).

&quot;Midgard&quot; uses D20 for &quot;attacks&quot;, &quot;spells&quot; and &quot;skills&quot;. An action succeeds if the sum of the rolled value and the corresponding &quot;success score&quot; (usually +4 to +20) is at least 20. The success score depends on the weapon or skill but is the same for all magical spells. Spells, however, cost action points and differ in the number of points they cost.

For attacks and attack spells, the &quot;damage&quot; is rolled with D6. The number of dice and the modifier depend on the weapon or spell used for the attack. For example, a dagger may inflict 1D6-1 (roll one D6 and subtract 1) whereas a lance may inflict up to 3D6+3 (roll three D6 and add three, in case of a mounted charge). A damage modifier (ranging from -3 to +5, depending on strength and dexterity) is added to the damage roll.

The attacked player may try to parry or evade by rolling a D20. This is successful if the roll plus the character&#x27;s &quot;defense&quot; or &quot;resistance score&quot; is equal to or larger than the sum achieved by the attacker. The character only loses exhaustion points (&quot;light damage&quot;). Otherwise, the character loses both hit and action points (&quot;heavy damage&quot;), whereby the number of hit points (but not action points) lost may be reduced depending on the character&#x27;s armor.

D100 are used for tests against the character&#x27;s &quot;attributes&quot; (e.g. strength or magical talent), which range from 1 to 100. The player rolls a D100 (usually replaced with two D10) and the test is successful if the roll is &quot;below or equal&quot; to the character&#x27;s attribute score.

Compared to &quot;Advanced Dungeons and Dragons&quot; or &quot;The Dark Eye&quot; (editions 1, 2 and 3), &quot;Midgard&quot; (and &quot;The Dark Eye&quot; editions 4 and 5) does not emphasise the character&#x27;s level very much. Characters may learn at any time, only limited by their experience points. The level increases when the player has spent a certain number of experience points. They may then spend some more experience points to increase the number of exhaustion points and there&#x27;s a slight chance (determined by D100) that the score of one of the base attributes increases.

== Game World ==

Midgard has many similarities to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fictional world, The Lord of the Rings. The player will encounter humans frequently, though they will also often encounter races like elves, dwarves, and halflings. Dragons, trolls and various forms of magic are also common. Midgard&#x27;s world is much more culturally diverse than Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;European&quot; Middle-earth. In the game, most earthly cultures, with the exception of North America, appear in slightly modified or combined forms. Midgard&#x27;s world is designed to be more archaic; it is largely influenced by the early Middle Ages, but also includes regions that are cut off from the rest of the world, meaning that they are still very much in the Stone Age. Midgard&#x27;s central locations are developing and are on their way into the Renaissance Era. Myrkgard was released 22 years after the release of Midgard. It offers a parallel world that is much darker than Midgard.

=== Geography ===

The known part of Midgard consists of four continents with the Sea of Five Winds lying between them. Vesternesse, a European-like continent, is located in the northwest and borders the sea. It contains the countries Alba, Chryseia, Erainn, Ywerddon, Clanngadan and Fuardain. South of Vesternesse lies Lamaran with the coastal states Eschar, Urruti and Buluga. East of the Sea lies Sirao, an Asian continent. Sirao contains Waeland, Moravod, the Tegar steppe, Aran, Medjis, KanThaiPan, Rawindra and the Minangpahit island kingdom. In the far west of the known world lies the continent of Huaxal, which includes: Nahuatlan, a state with South American Indian culture, and south of it the &quot;Fire Islands&quot;. In the middle of the Sea of Five Winds lies the Valian Archipelago, the remnant of the empire that fell in the &quot;War of the Mages.&quot;

== Midgard&#x27;s History ==
In 1978, Jürgen Franke self-published a guidebook called &quot;Empires Of Magira&quot;. It was set in the fantasy world of Magira (based on the novels by author Hugh Walker and from a tabletop simulation game named Armageddon).

This game had to be abandoned due to licensing disputes, but was later improved and re-released in 1981 under a new name: Midgard.

Midgard continued to develop the world of Magira and n. There is a neutral &quot;rule priest&quot; in Midgard as opposed to a named god. The game master and players can opt which ruling deity they can devote themselves to. Midgard prefers to use language such as &quot;game master&quot; instead of &quot;master&quot; and &quot;adventurer&quot; instead of &quot;hero&quot;.

In 1983, the Midgard II expansion was released.

In 1985 the revised guides appeared in the two books Midgard - The Fantasy Role Playing Game and Midgard - Key to Adventure. The guides were almost completely changed. There were around 20 classes instead of the initial four. These guides also introduced the stamina point/life point distinction, extensive system of skills, and more. This was the last edition that featured the world of Magira (see appendix), and the last edition that was published by J. Franke&#x27;s publishing house for fantasy and science fiction role-playing games (VF&amp;SF).

In 1989 and 1991 the game manufacturer, Klee Spiele, released the third, only slightly changed, edition of the rules as a boxed set for the first time. From now on, the underlying world was also called &quot;Midgard&quot; and was closely based on Magira. Some country names were left unchanged.

The Adventure Begins, a stripped-down entry-level box set, was published in 1999 by Pegasus Press. This was largely based on the rules of the fourth edition, which appeared in following years. But the fourth edition was also moderately changed in comparison to the 1985 and 1989 editions.

In 2000, after a long break, Midgard - The Arcanum, the magic part of the fourth edition of the rules, was published as a hardcover. It was followed by Midgard - The Fantasy Role Playing Game in 2001, Midgard - The Compendium in 2002, with a few additional rules and Midgard - The Bestiary in 2003, which describes the various creatures of Midgard.

In 2006, Midgard - Masters of the Spheres, the last part of this series was published under publishing label Midgard Press. For the 25th anniversary of the role-playing game in 2006, the complete set of rules was published in a three-volume deluxe edition, including The Codex, The Bestarium and The Arcanum, again under the old VFSF publishing house (which produced the 1985 edition). With The Codex, The Bestarium and The Arcanum, the complete Midgard rulebook has been published as a deluxe edition.

In October 2007, after long preparatory work and numerous test games, Midgard was released as a licensed product and the board game became a strategy game in the well-known Midgard world. A comic series called The Rune Blades was created especially for role-playing beginners. The first volume, Rune Blades 1: Blade Seeker, in the multi-part series begins with a comic introducing the events and game character. It was also published in October.

In 2008, the publisher began reissuing out-of-print adventure guides as PDFs available for purchase. In addition, a completely new adventure guide was published as a purchasable PDF instead of a print publication. The sequel, Runeblades 2: Wolfswinter, was released in February 2008, and finally, Finsterma was releasedl in June of the same year.

In 2009, the fan community received the revised new edition of the Alba source book, which had been out of print for a long time. It included the first cultural description of one of the non-human peoples with a source book on the culture of the dwarves. Three novels were published in the fan community explaining the background of the game world. In 2010, two completely new official source books and additional novels from the fan community were published.

In 2013, a fundamentally revised new edition of the basic rules, Midgard 5, was published by Midgard Press. For the first time, the player community was involved in the revision process and many wishes, experiences and suggestions were taken into account. In the new edition, the rules were simplified and reoriented towards beginners.

In June 2021 it was announced that Midgard would be further developed and published by Pegasus Spiele in 2024. In this context, a sixth edition of the rules is set to appear, and new source material will describe a parallel world to Midgard.

A new edition of the first rules edition was published in November 2021. The edition combines the Midgard 1 and 2 rulebooks in one hardcover.

Download codes for the PDF versions of the guides and bonus digital content come with the purchase of the printed guides.

According to the workshop report, the following goals were pursued during the revision:
# Ease of use, especially for newbies
# Compatibility with Midgard 4
# Simplification

<doc id="469269" wikidata="Q1325171" url="?curid=469269" title="Juzo Itami">
<text>, born , was a Japanese actor, screenwriter and film director. He directed eleven films (one short and ten features), all of which he wrote himself.

He is the namesake of the Juzo Itami Award, founded in 2009 to honor his legacy.

==Early life==
Itami was born Yoshihiro Ikeuchi in Kyoto. The name Itami was passed on from his father, Mansaku Itami, a renowned satirist and film director before World War II. In his childhood, he went by the name Takehiko Ikeuchi (池内 岳彦).

At the end of the war, in Kyoto, Itami was chosen as a prodigy and educated in a (&quot;special scientific education class&quot;), where he began to be trained as a future scientist who was expected to defeat the Allied powers. Among his fellow students were the sons of Hideki Yukawa and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. The program was abolished in March 1947.

He moved from Kyoto to Ehime Prefecture when he was a high school student. He attended the prestigious Matsuyama Higashi High School, where he was known for being able to read works by Arthur Rimbaud in French. Due to his poor academic record, he had to remain in the same class for two years; it was here that he became acquainted with Kenzaburō Ōe, who later married his sister.

When he was unable to graduate from Matsuyama Higashi High School, he transferred to Matsuyama Minami High School and graduated thereafter. After failing the entrance exam for the College of Engineering at Osaka University, Itami worked at times as a commercial designer and writer, illustrator, television reporter, and essayist. He was also the editor-in-chief for the 1980s psychoanalytic magazine &quot;Mon Oncle&quot;.

In his early acting days, Itami lived in London. By the time he became a director, he spoke English near-flawlessly, although preferred to use an interpreter during interviews.

Itami was the brother-in-law of Kenzaburō Ōe and an uncle of Hikari Ōe.

==Acting career==
Itami studied acting at an acting school called Butai Geijutsu Gakuin in Tokyo. In January 1960 he joined Daiei Film and was given the stage name by Masaichi Nagata. In May 1960, Itami married Kazuko Kawakita, the daughter of film producer Nagamasa Kawakita. He first acted on screen in &quot;Ginza no Dora-Neko&quot; (1960). In 1961 he left Daiei and started to appear in foreign-language films such as &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot;. In 1965 he appeared in the big-budget Anglo-American film &quot;Lord Jim&quot;. In 1965 he published a book of essays which became a hit, &quot;Yoroppa Taikutsu Nikki&quot; (&quot;Diary of Boredom in Europe&quot;). In 1966 he and Kazuko agreed to divorce.

In 1967, when working with director Nagisa Ōshima on the set of &quot;Sing a Song of Sex&quot; (&quot;Nihon Shunka Kō&quot;) he met Nobuko Miyamoto. He and Miyamoto married in 1969 and had two sons in the following years. Around this time, he changed his stage name to &quot;伊丹 十三&quot; (Itami Jūzō) with the kanji &quot;十&quot; (ten) rather than &quot;一&quot; (one), and with 十三 meaning &quot;thirteen&quot;, and worked as a character actor in film and television.

In 1968 he played Saburo Ishihara, the father of Takeshi and Koji during the second season of the children&#x27;s series &quot;Cometto-san&quot;. He became well known for this role in many Spanish-speaking countries, along with Yumiko Kokonoe who played the lead role.

In the 1970s, he joined the TV Man Union television production company and produced and presented documentaries for television, which influenced his later career as a film director. He also worked as a reporter for a TV program called &quot;Afternoon Show&quot;.

In 1983, Itami played the father in both Yoshimitsu Morita&#x27;s &quot;The Family Game&quot; and in Kon Ichikawa&#x27;s &quot;The Makioka Sisters,&quot; roles for which he won the Hochi Film Award and Best Supporting Actor at the Yokohama Film Festival.

Along with his acting career, he translated several English books into Japanese, including &quot;Papa, You&#x27;re Crazy&quot; by William Saroyan, &quot;The Kitchen Sink Papers: My Life as a Househusband&quot; by Mike McGrady, and &quot;The Potato Book&quot; by Myrna Davis and Truman Capote.

==Director==
Itami&#x27;s debut as director was the movie &quot;The Funeral (Osōshiki&quot;) in 1984, at the age of 51. This film proved popular in Japan and won many awards, including Japanese Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. However, it was his second movie, the 1985 &quot;noodle western&quot; &quot;Tampopo&quot;, that earned him international exposure and acclaim.

His following film &quot;A Taxing Woman&quot; (1987) was again highly successful. It won six major Japanese Academy awards and spawned a sequel &quot;A Taxing Woman&#x27;s Return&quot; in 1988. The central character, played by his wife Nobuko Miyamoto who appeared in all his films, became a pop culture heroine. This was followed by his fifth film &quot;A-Ge-Man: Tales of a Golden Geisha&quot;.

Itami directed the anti-&quot;yakuza&quot; satire &quot;Minbo: the Gentle Art of Japanese Extortion&quot; as his sixth feature. On May 22, 1992, six days after the release of the film, Itami was attacked, beaten, and slashed on the face by five members of the Goto-gumi, a Shizuoka-based &quot;yakuza&quot; clan, who were angry at Itami&#x27;s film&#x27;s portrayal of gang members. In an interview with the &quot;New York Times&quot;, he described the attack, saying, &quot;They cut very slowly; they took their time. They could have killed me if they wanted.&quot; This attack led to a government crackdown on the &quot;yakuza&quot;.

His subsequent stay in a hospital inspired his next film &quot;Daibyonin&quot; (1993), a grim satire on the Japanese health system. During a showing of this film in Japan, a cinema screen was slashed by a right-wing protester.

Before his death, he directed another three films: &quot;A Quiet Life&quot; (based on the Kenzaburō Ōe novel), &quot;Supermarket Woman&quot;, and &quot;Woman in Witness Protection&quot;.

===Recurring cast members===
Itami frequently re-cast actors whom he had worked with on previous films.
==Death==
Itami died on December 20, 1997 in Tokyo after falling from the roof of the building where his office was located. On his desk was found a suicide note written on a word processor stating that he had been falsely accused of an affair and was taking his life to clear his name. Two days later, a tabloid magazine published a report of such an affair.

However, no one in Itami&#x27;s family believed that he would have taken his life or that he would be mortally embarrassed by a real or alleged affair. In 2008, a former member of the Goto-gumi &quot;yakuza&quot; group told reporter Jake Adelstein: &quot;We set it up to stage his murder as a suicide. We dragged him up to the rooftop and put a gun in his face. We gave him a choice: jump and you might live or stay and we&#x27;ll blow your face off. He jumped. He didn&#x27;t live.&quot; The attack is thought to have been due to the topic of Itami&#x27;s next film, which was rumored to have been focusing on connections between the Goto-gumi and the cult-like Soka Gakkai religious group.

==Tributes==
His brother-in-law and childhood friend Kenzaburō Ōe wrote &quot;The Changeling&quot; (2000) based on their relationship.

There is a Juzo Itami museum in Matsuyama. The memorial museum was designed by architect Yoshifumi Nakamura and contains a special exhibition, rotating its displays every 1–2 years, a permanent exhibition, divided up into thirteen sections to reflect the &quot;thirteen&quot; meaning of Itami&#x27;s name, and an outdoor courtyard. It also houses a cafe named &quot;Café Tampopo&quot; after the film.

<text>Earl Howe is a title that has been created twice in British history, for members of the Howe and Curzon-Howe family respectively. 
The first creation, in the Peerage of Great Britain, was in 1788 for Richard Howe, 4th Viscount Howe, but it became extinct upon his death in 1799. The second creation, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, was in 1821 for Richard Curzon-Howe, 2nd Viscount Curzon, and it remains extant.

==History==

===First creation (1788)===
The Howe family descended from John Grobman Howe, of Langar, Nottinghamshire. He married Annabella, illegitimate daughter of Emanuel Scrope, 1st Earl of Sunderland. Their son, Scrope Howe, sat as a Knight of the Shire for Nottinghamshire. In 1701 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Glenawley and Viscount Howe. The second Viscount also represented Nottinghamshire in the House of Commons and served as Governor of Barbados. He married Charlotte, Baroness von Kielmansegg, niece of George I. Her mother was the illegitimate half-sister of the King. Lord Howe was succeeded by his son, the third Viscount. He was a Brigadier-General in the British Army and was killed during the Battle of Carillon in 1758.

He was succeeded by his younger brother, Richard, the fourth Viscount. He was a distinguished naval commander best known for his victory of the Glorious First of June in 1794. In 1782 Howe was created Viscount Howe, of Langar in the County of Nottingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which entitled him to a seat in the House of Lords. In 1788 he was further honoured when he was made Baron Howe, of Langar in the County of Nottingham, with remainder to his daughters and the heirs male of their bodies, and Earl Howe, with normal remainder to heirs male of his body. These titles were also in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Howe had no male issue and on his death in 1799 the viscountcy of 1782 and earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony of Howe according to the special remainder by his eldest daughter, Sophia Charlotte (see below). The Irish titles passed to his younger brother, William, the fifth Viscount. He was a noted soldier and served as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in North America during the American Revolutionary War. He had no surviving issue and on his death in 1814 the barony of Glenawley and viscounty of Howe became extinct.

===Second creation (1821)===
The aforementioned Lady Sophia, who succeeded her father as second Baroness Howe in 1799, married the Hon. Penn Curzon, Member of Parliament for Clitheroe. He was the only son of Assheton Curzon, second son of Sir Nathaniel Curzon, 4th Baronet, of Kedleston (ancestor of George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, and the Barons and Viscounts Scarsdale; see Viscount Scarsdale for earlier history of the family). Assheton Curzon represented Clitheroe in the House of Commons for twenty-seven years. In 1794 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Curzon, of Penn in the County of Buckingham, and in 1802 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Curzon, of Penn in the County of Buckingham, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Curzon was succeeded by his grandson, the second Viscount. He was the only son of Penn Curzon and Lady Howe. In 1821 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Howe and the same year the earldom held by his maternal grandfather was revived when he was created Earl Howe in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1835 he also succeeded his mother as third Baron Howe. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Leicestershire South.
He died without male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl. He was a General in the British Army. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, was a Conservative politician and held minor office in the Conservative administration of 1895 to 1905. On his death in 1929 the title passed to his eldest son, the fifth Earl. He was a Conservative Member of Parliament and also involved in the world of motor racing. His only son, the sixth Earl, had four daughters but no sons and on his death in 1984 the line of the fourth Earl failed. The late Earl was succeeded by his second cousin, the seventh Earl. He is the only son of the actor George Curzon, son of the Hon. Frederick Graham Curzon-Howe, second son of the third Earl. Lord Howe held office from 1991 to 1997 in the Conservative administrations of John Major and since 2015 has been Deputy Leader of the House of Lords and Minister of State for Defence. He is now one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. As a descendant of Sir Nathaniel Curzon, 4th Baronet, of Kedleston, he is also in remainder to this title, which is held by his kinsman the Viscount Scarsdale.

Several other members of the Curzon-Howe family have also gained distinction. The Hon. Frederick Howe (1823–1881), third son of the first Earl, was a captain in the Royal Navy. The Hon. Ernest George Howe (1828–1885), sixth son of the first Earl, was a Colonel in the British Army. The Hon. Sir Leicester Smyth (1829–1891) (who assumed the surname of Smyth in 1866), seventh son of the first Earl, was a General in the British Army and served as Governor of Gibraltar. The Hon. Montagu Curzon (1846–1907), eighth son of the first Earl (and eldest from his second marriage), was a Colonel in the Rifle Brigade and Member of Parliament. The Hon. Sir Assheton Curzon-Howe, ninth son and youngest child of the first Earl, was a naval commander and served as Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet from 1908 to 1910. His eldest son Leicester Charles Assheton St John Curzon-Howe (1894–1941) was a Captain in the Royal Navy. Lady Mary Anna Curzon-Howe, only daughter from the second marriage of the first Earl, married James Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Abercorn. Their granddaughter Lady Cynthia Hamilton married Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer, and was the grandmother of Diana, Princess of Wales. The aforementioned George Curzon, son of the Hon. Frederick Graham Curzon-Howe, second son of the third Earl, was an actor.

The family seat is Penn House, Penn Street, Buckinghamshire.

<text>The Świna (; Pomeranian: &quot;Swina&quot;) is a channel in northwest Poland, between from the German border. It connects the Szczecin Lagoon with the Baltic Sea separating the islands of Uznam (German: Usedom) and Wolin (German: Wollin). It is a part of the Oder estuary, and carries about 75% of that river&#x27;s waterflow (of the remainder, Peenestrom carries 15% and Dziwna 10%). It has a length of about . Świnoujście is a major town at the end of the channel towards the Baltic Sea.
The German Empire dammed and deepened the straits from 1874 to 1880 to create the &quot;Kaiserfahrt&quot; (Piast canal). It connects the northern part of the Świna directly with the Szczecin Lagoon and the Pomeranian harbor of Szczecin (Stettin). The straits thus gained importance as a direct waterway to the industrial city. The territory along the straits&#x27; path was transferred from Germany to Poland following World War II.

==Regressive Delta==

The regressive delta was formed by the floods of the Świna channel in the area of the Wolin National Park in 1996. This water-muddy natural complex forms an archipelago of 44 islands and canals with changing directions of water flow. The Delta Świna channel was formed by the Scandinavian glacier that withdrew from this territory 12,000 years ago. During the western and northern storms, sea water flowed into Szczecin Lagoon, overflowing the islands. The borders of islands are constantly shaped during the process of accumulation.

<doc id="469279" wikidata="Q194730" url="?curid=469279" title="John Sewel, Baron Sewel">
<text>John Buttifant Sewel, Baron Sewel, (; born 15 January 1946), is a British politician, life peer, and former academic. He served as Chairman of Committees of the House of Lords, its deputy speaker. He is also a former senior vice principal of the University of Aberdeen and a former parliamentary under-secretary of state.

He was made a Labour minister in the Scottish Office department of the Blair Government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland in 1997, where he assisted Donald Dewar in steering through the legislation that led to the creation of the Scottish Parliament. His name is given to the Sewel motion, parliamentary device passed by the Scottish Parliament, in which it agrees that the United Kingdom parliament may pass legislation on a devolved issue extending to Scotland, over which the Scottish Parliament has regular legislative authority. He left ministerial office in 1999 upon the new Parliament taking over the majority of the Scottish Office&#x27;s functions. Sewel left the House of Lords in 2015 after photos of him doing drugs with prositutes emerged.

==Early life==
Sewel was born on 15 January 1946. He was educated at Hanson Boys&#x27; Grammar School and Durham University (BA, 1967) before taking his MSc degree at University College of Wales, Swansea in 1970, and a PhD from the University of Aberdeen in 1977.

==Academic career==

Sewel joined the University of Aberdeen as a research fellow in the Department of Politics in 1969. During the next three decades he worked in the Departments of Education and Political Economy and also the Regional Centre for the Study of Economic and Social Policy, where he was appointed to his chair. In 1988 he became the dean of the then Faculty of Economic &amp; Social Sciences. Subsequently, in 1995, he was appointed vice-principal and dean of the faculty of Social Sciences &amp; Law.

Sewel returned to the University of Aberdeen to resume his role as vice-principal in 1999 and was subsequently senior vice-principal from 2001 to 2004.

==Political career==
Sewel was first elected to political office as an Aberdeen District Councillor in 1974, serving as council leader from 1977 to 1980, and also as president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities from 1982 to 1984. Sewel was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1984 New Year Honours. Later, he was an influential member of the Scottish Constitutional Convention from 1994 to 1995.

On 10 January 1996 he was created Baron Sewel, of Gilcomstoun in the District of the City of Aberdeen, and became Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Scottish Office from 1997 to 1999, serving as the Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries. As such he piloted the Scotland Act 1998 through Parliament and helped draft the plans for the new Scottish Parliament. At the first election to the Parliament, Sewel was a candidate as third on the Labour Party list for North East Scotland, but was not elected.

As an active member of the House of Lords, Sewel chaired the European Union Select Committee in Agriculture, the Environment and Fisheries and was a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. His interests include enlargement of the European Union and of NATO, constitutional change and rural development.

Sewel was elected Chairman of Committees on 9 May 2012, whereupon he gave up the Labour whip and sat as a non-affiliated member in the House of Lords.

===Scandal and resignation===

He resigned as Chairman of Committees on 26 July 2015 after &quot;The Sun&quot; released hidden camera footage seemingly showing him snorting white powder (widely reported in the media to be cocaine) at a party with prostitutes. In the same video he described David Cameron as the &quot;most superficial [and] facile Prime Minister there has ever been&quot;. On the following day he was granted a leave of absence from the Lords, and on 28 July 2015 he formally resigned from the House of Lords.

<doc id="469283" wikidata="Q6038855" url="?curid=469283" title="Instapundit">
<text>Instapundit is a conservative blog maintained by Glenn Reynolds, a law professor at the University of Tennessee.

==History and characteristics==
InstaPundit was launched in August 2001 as an experiment, and a part of Reynolds&#x27; class on Internet law. After the September 11 attacks, the site quickly became a highly popular blog—with Reynolds celebrated as &quot;chief among the warbloggers&quot;—and was dubbed the &quot;Grand Central Station of Bloggerville&quot; in 2002 and reported to be &quot;the most visited [blog] in the world&quot; in early 2004. A 2007 memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee described Reynolds as one of the five &quot;best-read national conservative bloggers.&quot;

Common topics are politics, technology (such as nanotechnology), space exploration, human longevity, digital photography, individual liberty and gun politics, domestic policy, the media, and the blogosphere as a social phenomenon. Instapundit frequently discussed the war on terror from a supportive-but-critical viewpoint. Reynolds has also lent his support to the Porkbusters campaign, which purports to expose misallocation of federal funds.

In June 2009, Reynolds changed his blog header to the color green from its original red, in support of the anti-Ahmadinejad/pro-Mousavi protests made after the Iranian Presidential election. This was originally supposed to be a temporary show of support, but it lasted about three months. On September 7, 2009, Reynolds replaced the green with his customary red, remarking, &quot;I’m back to the original design. &#x27;Going Green&#x27; was supposed to be a show of support, not a permanent change, and the summer’s over. My support for the Iranian freedom movement is no less, but symbolism takes you only so far.&quot;

==Influence on other bloggers==
Sometimes referred to as &quot;the Blogfather, and credited with an &quot;ethic of driving traffic to new blogs from all over the political spectrum,&quot; Reynolds managed to attract a large following of imitators who adopted his blogging style. His ability to &quot;foster a hospitable environment for new bloggers&quot; has been attributed to his involvement in home-recording punk and new-wave music, and his adaptation of the participatory ethos of these musical styles to online publishing.

In April 2002, Reynolds published a list of well over two hundred blogs that claimed to be directly inspired by his own.

Instapundit&#x27;s popularity led to the common adoption of the suffix &quot;-pundit&quot; in blog titles, for example Kevin Drum (who originally blogged as &quot;CalPundit&quot;) and Allahpundit. There are also direct take-offs on the entire name, such as Instapunk, and IsntAPundit. There are many other &quot;-pundit&quot; blogs, of all political stripes inspired to some degree by Instapundit.

<text>Philip Charles Harris, Baron Harris of Peckham (born 15 September 1942), is an English businessman and politician. A prominent Conservative Party donor, before switching to Labour in 2024, Harris is a member of the House of Lords.

He is the sponsor of a large multi-academy trust, the Harris Federation.

==Interests==
===Business===

Harris is currently an advisor and shareholder of Tapi Carpets, a flooring retailer set up recently by a number of the old Carpetright management team. Harris was the Chairman of Carpetright plc and has over fifty years&#x27; experience in carpet retailing. Harris left Carpetright in 2014, sold all of his shares and he is no longer associated with the company.

He was chairman and chief executive of Harris Carpets. Harris Carpets acquired Queensway in 1977 to become Harris Queensway plc until the company was taken over in 1988.

Harris was also a non-executive director of Great Universal Stores plc for 18 years, retiring from the GUS Board in July 2004. Harris became a non-executive director of Matalan in October 2004.

===Football===
He was appointed to the board of Arsenal Football Club as a non-executive director in November 2005.

===Equestrian interests===
Harris is the co-owner of the horse Hello Sanctos, which won a gold medal with Scott Brash in the team show jumping event at the London 2012 Summer Olympics.

Harris and Lord Kirkham bought the horse for an estimated €2 million at the start of 2012.
They are also co-owners of the horses Hello Sailor, Hello Unique and Hello Boyo.

==Politics==
===Conservative Party donations===

Harris has been a donor to the Conservative Party since the 1980s and was a great admirer of Margaret Thatcher. He also made donations to David Cameron as leader of the Conservative Party and Michael Gove.

===Comments on Theresa May===
In a September 2017 interview with &quot;The Times&quot; he described Theresa May as very indecisive, hopeless during the general election campaign which she should have won easily, and leading a weak, directionless government.
Other comments made included his opposition to an expansion of grammar schools, May u-turning on too many decisions such as the so-called dementia tax, and the Home Office not reducing net migration to the tens of thousands as repeatedly promised. Harris spoke about potential candidates on who could succeed May as Conservative Party Leader.

==Harris Federation academies==

He has contributed extensively to education and as a result, many schools and colleges (such as Harris Manchester College, Oxford) bear his name. Through the Harris Federation, many secondary schools in South London have received Harris donations. In the London Borough of Croydon, he helped to found the Harris City Technology College, Harris Academy South Norwood and Harris Academy Merton, Harris Academy Purley, Harris Academy Chafford Hundred, Harris Academy Peckham although many local residents are angered that the original name of the Harris Academy South Norwood, Stanley Technical High School, was dropped in place of the Harris name.

In recent years, the forced change to academy status has placed additional schools under the management of the Harris Federation despite considerable opposition from Boards of Governors and parents.

==Personal life==
===&quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List===

Harris ranked 206th in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List, with an estimated wealth of £285m.

==Honours==
Harris was knighted in 1985. He was made a life peer as Baron Harris of Peckham, in the London Borough of Southwark on 11 January 1996.

His wife, Pauline, was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 2004.

<doc id="469285" wikidata="Q7234043" url="?curid=469285" title="Postal counties of the United Kingdom">
<text>The postal counties of the United Kingdom, now known as former postal counties, were postal subdivisions in routine use by the Royal Mail until 1996. The purpose of the postal county – as opposed to any other kind of county – was to aid the sorting of mail by differentiating between similar post towns. Since 1996 this has been done by using the outward code (first half) of the postcode instead. For operational reasons, the former postal counties, although broadly based on the counties of the United Kingdom, did not match up with their boundaries; in some cases there were significant differences. The boundaries changed over time as post towns were created or amended.

According to the Royal Mail, the former postal county data no longer forms part of postal addresses. It was removed from the Postcode Address File database in 2000 and does not form part of its code of practice for changing addresses. Despite this, county data is routinely sold to companies, ostensibly to let them cleanse their own address data. As the former postal county data was the last to be in routine use, some organisations have continued to use this obsolete data as part of postal addresses. In 2009, the Royal Mail code of practice consultation included discussion of the possible replacement of the currently supplied &quot;alias data&quot; with an up-to-date county information data field. In 2010, the regulator advised Royal Mail to cease supply of county data altogether, and a timetable was put in place for this to occur between 2013 and 2016.

==Origins==
In the 19th century and early 20th centuries, the Post Office required the name of the post town to be included in addresses, but advised against including the name of the county. The exception was if a post town&#x27;s name was not unique, in which case the county name was to be included in the address in order to distinguish between post towns of the same name.

Sometime between 1920 and 1934 the Post Office changed its advice on counties. It recommended instead that the name of the county in which the post town lay should be included in most cases, with the exception of certain large towns and cities and those which gave their name to the county.

==Differences==
As the name of the county to be used in the postal address was derived from the post town, there were various scenarios where there were differences between the postal county and the geographic or administrative counties:

===Places part of a post town in another county===
First, many of the approximately 1,500 post towns straddled county boundaries, and the postal addresses of all places in such areas included the postal county of the post town, regardless of their actual location. In a written answer in the House of Lords in 1963, Lord Chesham, Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Transport estimated that about 7% of towns and villages with a post office lay in a postal county different from their geographical county. He went to explain that:
Examples, usually consisting of small villages near to county boundaries, included:

There were additional examples resulting from the 1974 reorganisation of local government:
The postal counties were subject to change over time as post towns near to county boundaries were amended. For example, Chinley in Derbyshire had a postal address of &quot;Stockport, Cheshire&quot; which was later updated to &quot;High Peak, Derbyshire&quot; when a new post town was created.

===London===
Second, the London postal district, which formed a special post town, did not conform to any administrative boundaries. The postal district was created in 1858 and has periodically been revised. However, at no point has its boundary coincided with either the metropolis (later County of London) of 1855–1965, which was somewhat smaller, or the Greater London area created in 1965, which was much bigger. Addresses in the London post town, an area of (or 40% of Greater London), did not include a county; however, the rest of Greater London (60% of its area) formed parts of other post towns in the postal counties of Surrey, Kent, Essex, Middlesex and Hertfordshire. For example, Wembley Stadium had a postal address of &quot;Wembley, Middlesex&quot; rather than &quot;London&quot;. Some London boroughs were split between multiple postal counties: for example Barnet had sections in the London postal district (e.g. Golders Green) and in the Middlesex and Hertfordshire postal counties (e.g. Edgware and East Barnet); with the NW7 postcode district touching the Greater London boundary to divide the three sections. Sewardstone, in the Epping Forest district of Essex, is the only locality outside Greater London to be included in the London postal district (E4).

===Changes to administrative county boundaries===
Third, the Royal Mail adopted some, but not all, of the local government reforms of 1965 and 1974/5. This caused postal counties in some areas to reflect boundary changes, while in other areas they did not. Although the Post Office did not follow the changes of the London Government Act 1963 with respect to the outer London suburbs, it did reflect the move of Potters Bar from Middlesex to Hertfordshire. In contrast, Middlesex remained part of the postal address for Staines, Sunbury and Ashford, which had transferred to Surrey. The 1960s saw an increase in the number of addresses the Post Office delivered to, but a decrease in the volume of mail sent, which caused a significant drop in revenue and a proportionate increase in operational costs. Furthermore, retaining the existing postal county boundaries was explained as largely due to cost reasons. &quot;The Times&quot; pointed out that this might cause confusion, noting that in future &quot;children will no doubt wonder why their address should refer to a county in which they have never lived&quot;, but that &quot;some people […] want the name of Middlesex preserved because of its historical associations&quot;.

The Local Government Act 1972 redrew the administrative county map of England and Wales outside Greater London. The Post Office was considering its policy in January 1973, and in November 1973 noted that &quot;Greater Manchester&quot; would be unlikely to be adopted because of confusion of the Manchester post town, but that Avon was likely to be introduced. When the local government changes came into force, the Post Office announced that the new counties would form part of postal addresses from 1 July 1974, and should be used as &quot;soon as possible&quot;. Old counties could, however, still be used until 1 July 1975. It was stated that the rule applied to: &quot;...addresses throughout England and Wales outside Greater London with the exception of Greater Manchester and Hereford and Worcester where addresses remain unchanged. In Humberside it is necessary to show whether an address is in North Humberside or South Humberside. Addresses in certain post-towns have not, in the past, included a county name; these addresses are unchanged, but the postcode should be shown. Addresses in Greater London are also unchanged as are addresses in any place where the new county bears the same name as the former one.&quot; The postal counties listed in 1961 that did not continue after the reforms were Cumberland, Rutland, Sussex, Westmorland and Yorkshire.

In Scotland, counties were entirely abolished for local government purposes in May 1975. The matter of postal counties was raised in the House of Lords in April 1975. Lord Beswick, Minister of State at the Department of Industry, stated that &quot;the Post Office is consulting its customers in Scotland about the possible use of new postal addresses for Scotland based on the new local government Regions and Island Areas&quot;. In the event, the postal counties were not changed. Thus Alva, despite being in the Central Region after 1975, was still postally in Clackmannanshire. Gordon Oakes, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of the Environment, explained the policy in a written answer to a question in parliament, shortly after the changes were brought in:

===Special post towns===
The postal county was omitted for addresses within 110 post towns. These were mainly either larger towns and cities or places where the county name was derived from the post town. These post towns were:

The post towns of BRECON, CAERNARVON, CARDIGAN, CARMARTHEN, DENBIGH, FLINT, HUNTINGDON, MONMOUTH, MONTGOMERY and PEMBROKE also qualified as special post towns until 1974 as the name of the county was derived from the town. Following the Local Government Act 1972, addresses in these post towns required the new postal county.

==Postal counties in operation from 1974 to 1996==
:&quot;listed with official abbreviations, if any&quot;

===England===
Postal counties broadly matched the county boundaries established in 1974, unless noted otherwise under &quot;geographic coverage&quot;.

===Scotland===
The postal counties of Scotland broadly followed the boundaries of the civil counties on the mainland. Offshore islands, however, were regarded as distinct counties for postal purposes. There was no postal county of Buteshire, which was instead divided between the Isles of Arran, Bute and Cumbrae.

===Wales===
===Northern Ireland===
Normally, counties in Northern Ireland are named with the word &#x27;County&#x27;, and not simply the county name, perhaps to avoid confusion with the towns of the same name.

==After 1996==

===Postcode defined circulation===
The Royal Mail ceased to use postal counties as a means of sorting mail following the modernisation of their optical character recognition equipment in 1996. Instead, using postcode defined circulation, the outward code (first half) of the postcode is used to differentiate between like-sounding post towns. In 2000 the postal county data was removed from the Postcode Address File database and was added to the Alias File, which is used to cleanse data of local, colloquial and &quot;postally-not-required&quot; details that have been added to addresses. According to Royal Mail policy the field is not updated and where new post towns are created they will not be assigned to a former postal county. In guidance to customers it is required that the correct post town and postcode must be included in addresses and a county is not required. As part of a &quot;flexible addressing policy&quot; customers can add a county, which will be ignored in the sorting process.

===1990s local government reform===
During the 1990s a reform of local government in England caused further changes to the locations in which the former postal counties did not match up to the geographic counties. Avon, Cleveland and Humberside were abolished as geographic counties and Rutland was reconstituted. This had the following effects on the relationship between the geographic and postal counties:

Hereford and Worcester was abolished and reconstituted as two separate counties once more, broadly matching the former postal counties. Greater London and Greater Manchester remained unaffected by the reform. Local government was also reorganised in 1996 in both Scotland (Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994) and Wales (Local Government (Wales) Act 1994), such that in some places counties reverted to the historic names once again (e.g. Pembrokeshire), but in others the post-1974 names were retained (e.g. Powys and Gwynedd). As the Royal Mail had also declared postal counties redundant in 1996, the former postal county data was not updated to reflect these changes.

===Extended usage===
Despite Royal Mail stipulating that counties no longer form part of addresses, many organisations have continued routinely to include them as part of postal addressing, often simply combining Postcode Address File data with the data from the Alias File. Some organisations using software which requires a county to be included as part of a postal address have extended the use of counties to addresses in special post towns, which never needed them.

This continued use has caused customers in areas where there is discrepancy between the postal and geographic counties to complain to Royal Mail. Until 2007 the Royal Mail position was that under their current code of practice, changes to county data will not be considered. However, after a lengthy and well-organised campaign, the Royal Mail agreed to create a postal county of Rutland in 2007. This was achieved in January 2008 by amending the former postal county for all of the Oakham (LE15) post town and part of the Market Harborough (LE16) post town. In contrast, Seaton Delaval residents had unsuccessfully campaigned in 2004 to be removed from the former postal county of Tyne and Wear.

In 2009 the Royal Mail code of practice came up for renewal, and the regulator Postcomm held a public consultation on its future. Consultation guidance from the regulator indicated that although the former postal county data is obsolete, it was the last available data set to be in routine use and was therefore the most likely to be used by corporate customers for their address databases. It was also recognised that residential customers in some areas were not happy with this situation. The Royal Mail reconfirmed its preference for eliminating counties altogether from addressing, but also invited comments on providing a new and updated county data field, reflecting boundary changes. Postcomm found that many respondents objected to the use of obsolete counties. In May 2010 Postcomm decided to advise Royal Mail to &quot;discontinue provision of such information at the earliest opportunity&quot;. However, because some existing software included the use of counties, Royal Mail was advised not to implement the change before 2013. The timetable announced by Royal Mail in July 2010 indicated that this was likely to happen between 2013 and 2016.

In 2013 Felicity MacFarlane stated the Royal Mail position: 
Between November and December 2013 a further consultation on the issue was conducted by the PAF Advisory Board that sought opinions on removing some or all of the county data from the Alias File and the results were published in January 2014.

<text>The Piast Canal (, ) is a ship canal that connects the Szczecin Lagoon in the estuary of the Oder river with the Baltic Sea via the Świna river. The eastern part of the Świna is bypassed by the canal, providing a more convenient south-north connection for large ships from the Baltic to reach the industrial city of Szczecin () more easily.

== History ==
The canal, approximately 12 km long and ten metres deep, was dug during the time of the German Empire between 1874 and 1880, in the reign of the Kaiser Wilhelm I (). Thus it was not named after his grandson Kaiser Wilhelm II () who was famous for his interest in seafaring and battleships. Baptized as &quot;&quot;, the canal allowed ships to circumvent the eastern branch of the Świna river, which was very difficult to navigate. The resulting benefit to shipping between the Baltic Sea and the lagoon saw the ascendancy of the port of Stettin and a decline in the port of Świnoujście (), because now ocean-going ships could sail as far as Stettin. Another side effect was that the eastern part of the island Usedom was cut off, creating an island that was named after its largest village, Kaseburg (). On the other hand, the railway line, opened in 1875, from Berlin to Swinemünde over the bridge near Karnin (blown up in 1945), helped to promote Swinemünde and its neighbouring villages as seaside resorts.

After World War II, the area became part of Poland under border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference, and the canal was renamed in reference to the medieval history of Poland during the Piast dynasty – the Piast dynasty was first Polish royal dynasty. In October 2020, an unexploded Tallboy earthquake bomb from the Royal Air Force&#x27;s attack on German cruiser &quot;Lützow&quot; in 1945 was found in the canal. After evacuating approximately 750 people who lived nearby, an attempt was undertaken by the Polish Navy&#x27;s 8th Coastal Defence Flotilla to deflagrate it with a remote-controlled device, but it exploded, without casualties. It was the largest single piece of unexploded ordnance found in Poland since the war.

<doc id="469293" wikidata="Q5326214" url="?curid=469293" title="Earl of Bradford">
<text>Earl of Bradford, of Bradford in the County of Salop, is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was first created in 1694 for Francis Newport, 2nd Baron Newport. However, all the Newport titles became extinct on the death of the fourth Earl in 1762. The earldom was revived in 1815 for Orlando Bridgeman, 2nd Baron Bradford. The Bridgeman family had previously succeeded to the Newport estates.

==History of the title==

===Newport creation===

The Newports were an ancient Shropshire family. One member of the family, Richard Newport, represented Shropshire and Shrewsbury in Parliament and was a supporter of King Charles I during the Civil War. In 1642 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Newport, of High Ercall in the County of Shropshire. His son Francis, the second Baron, represented Shrewsbury in the Long Parliament and fought as a Royalist in the Civil War. After the Restoration he served as Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire, as Comptroller of the Household and as Treasurer of the Household. In 1676 Newport was created Viscount Newport, of Bradford in the County of Shropshire, and on 11 May 1694 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Bradford, in the County of Shropshire. Both titles were in the Peerage of England.

Lord Bradford was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He sat as a Whig Member of Parliament for Shropshire and served as Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire. In 1681 Lord Bradford married Mary Wilbraham, daughter of Sir Thomas Wilbraham, Bt, and Elizabeth Mytton. Through this marriage Weston Park in Staffordshire came into the Newport family. Their eldest son, the third Earl, represented Bishop&#x27;s Castle and Shropshire in the House of Commons and was also Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire. He had no legitimate children and on his death the peerages passed to his younger brother, the fourth Earl. When he died in 1762 all the Newport titles became extinct. The family estates, including Weston Park, were inherited by his nephew, Sir Henry Bridgeman, 5th Baronet, of Great Lever (see below).

The Hon. Thomas Newport, younger son of the first Earl, was created Baron Torrington in 1716.
===Bridgeman creation===

The Bridgeman family originally stems from Devon. One member of the family, John Bridgeman, grandson of Edward Bridgeman, served as Bishop of Chester from 1619 to 1652. His son, Orlando Bridgeman, was a prominent lawyer and politician. In 1660 he was created a baronet, of Great Lever in the County of Lancaster, in the Baronetage of England. His great-grandson, the fourth Baronet, represented Shrewsbury in Parliament. In 1719 he married Lady Anne Newport, daughter of Richard Newport, 2nd Earl of Bradford. Their son, the fifth Baronet, was a Member of Parliament for Ludlow and Wenlock for over forty years. In 1762 he succeeded through his mother to the Newport estates, including Weston Park, on the death of his uncle, the fourth Earl of Bradford (see above). After Bridgeman&#x27;s retirement from the House of Commons in 1794, the Bradford title held by his mother&#x27;s family was revived when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Bradford, of Bradford in the County of Shropshire.

His son, the second Baron, represented Wigan in Parliament. In 1815, the earldom of Bradford was revived when he was created Viscount Newport, in the County of Shropshire, and Earl of Bradford, in the County of Shropshire. His grandson, the third Earl, was a Conservative politician and notably served as Lord Steward of the Household and as Master of the Horse. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, represented North Shropshire in Parliament as a Conservative. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fifth Earl. He was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the army and fought in the Boer War and in the First World War. Lord Bradford was also Private Secretary to both Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and to Prime Minister Arthur Balfour and held office as a Government Whip in the House of Lords from 1919 to 1924. The present holder of the titles is his grandson, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 1981.

Another member of the Bridgeman family was the Conservative politician William Bridgeman, 1st Viscount Bridgeman. He was the son of Reverend the Hon. John Robert Orlando Bridgeman, third son of the second Earl of Bradford.
==Family seats==
The family seat is Weston Park in Staffordshire. They also held Castle Bromwich Hall, a manor in Warwickshire, along with the adjoining Castle Bromwich Hall Gardens. The Hall is now a hotel, and its gardens have been restored by a Trust and are open to the public.

Weston Park was held by the family until 1986. Gerald, the 6th Earl of Bradford, who had succeeded to the title in 1957, died in 1981, leaving the family with large death duties. After five years of negotiations with the Treasury, Weston Park was donated to the nation via a Foundation established in 1986.

Since then, a G8 Summit Retreat was held at Weston Park in 1998 with the heads of State or Government present including US President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin and, since 1999, the grounds of Weston Park have been used as one of the sites of the annual dual-site Virgin sponsored V Festival. While the family of the 7th Earl of Bradford has no remaining claim to Weston Park, much of the artwork (including works by van Dyck and others) remains privately held.

<doc id="469300" wikidata="Q5122916" url="?curid=469300" title="Citrus production">
<text>Citrus production encompasses the production of citrus fruit, which are the highest-value fruit crop in terms of international trade. There are two main markets for citrus fruit:
* The fresh fruit market
* The processed citrus fruits market (mainly orange juice)

Oranges account for the majority of citrus production but the industry also sees significant quantities of grapefruits, pomeloes, lemons, and limes.

==History==

While the origin of citrus fruits cannot be precisely identified, researchers believe they began to appear in Southeast Asia at least 4,000 BC. From there, they slowly spread to northern Africa, mainly through migration and trade. During the period of the Roman Empire, demand by higher-ranking members of society, along with increased trade, allowed the fruits to spread to southern Europe. Citrus fruits spread throughout Europe during the Middle Ages, and were then brought to the Americas by Spanish explorers. Worldwide trade in citrus fruits did not appear until the 20th century, and trade in orange juice developed as late as 1940.

==Volume==
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, world production of all citrus fruits in 2020 was , with about half of this production as oranges. In the international fruit trade, citrus is the largest in terms of financial value. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), citrus production grew during the early 21st century mainly by the increase in cultivation areas, improvements in transportation and packaging, rising incomes and consumer preference for healthful foods. In 2019–20, world production of oranges was estimated to be , led by Brazil, China, India, EU, USA, Mexico, Egypt as the largest producers.

==Countries involved==
Citrus fruits are produced all over the world; according to the FAO, as of 2016, about 79% of the world&#x27;s total citrus production was grown in the Northern Hemisphere, with countries of the Mediterranean Basin contributing the largest volumes, while Brazil was the largest citrus producer in the Southern Hemisphere and the world.

In the United States, most orange juice and grapefruit is produced in Florida, while citrus fruits for consumption as fresh fruit are grown mainly in California, Arizona, and Texas. Smaller markets for citrus growth in the United States originate in South Carolina, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and the gulf coastal states, including Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia, as well as North Carolina. Independent cultivars are found in Kentucky, Virginia, and even Missouri, Southern Illinois, and far Southern Kansas. The farther north the range, the more seasonal the cultivation. Florida produces approximately 100 million boxes annually (each box is 90 lbs).

China could be a major player in the orange juice and processed citrus markets, except for high tariffs on citrus that make domestic sale more profitable. Though citrus originated in southeast Asia, current citrus production is low due to lower-than-average yields, high production and marketing costs, and disease.


==Oranges and orange juice==
About a third of citrus fruit production goes for processing: more than 80% of this is for orange juice production. Demand for fresh and processed oranges continues to rise in excess of production, especially in developed countries.

The two main juice producers are Florida in the United States and the state of São Paulo in Brazil. Production of orange juice between these two makes up roughly 85% of the world market. Brazil exports 99 percent of its production, while 90 percent of Florida&#x27;s production is consumed in the United States.

Orange juice is traded internationally in the form of frozen concentrated orange juice to reduce the volume used, so that storage and transportation costs are lower.

==Citrus canker==
Citrus production is often cut short in many areas by outbreaks of bacteria known as &quot;Xanthomonas axonopodis&quot;, or citrus canker, which cause unsightly lesions on all parts of the plant, affecting tree vitality and early drop of fruit. While not harmful to human consumption, the fruit becomes too unsightly to be sold, and entire orchards are often destroyed to protect the outbreak from spreading.

Citrus canker affects all varieties of citrus trees, and recent outbreaks in Australia, Brazil, and the United States have slowed citrus production in parts of those countries. Citrus leafminer moths are a major concern where citrus canker exists. The openings created by citrus leafminer make the tree highly susceptible to the &quot;X. axonopodis&quot; bacteria which leads to citrus canker.

==Citrus greening disease in Florida==

===Introductory and effects of disease===
Huanglongbing (HLB), called citrus greening within the industry, is recognized as the deadliest citrus disease the Florida citrus industry has ever faced. This can be attributed to the economic costs of implementing new care-taking strategies, and overall tree loss creating a loss of revenues. A look at total Florida citrus-growing acreage provides a tangible impression to the hardships citrus greening provides; in 2000 there was 665,529 commercially producing citrus acres, while in 2011 there were 473,086 commercially producing citrus acres in Florida. Every year citrus reports indicate a continued loss of citrus production. Citrus greening is being attributed for a total output impact of −4.51 billion, and a loss of 8,257 jobs within Florida. The disease has now spread throughout the entire state, and affects every Florida citrus grower. The disease is spread through an insect vector, the Asian citrus psyllid. The psyllid was previously introduced into Florida in 1998. Prior to 1998 citrus greening was unknown in the state, thus the psyllids spread was left unchecked. By the time citrus greening had reached Florida psyllid populations were well established throughout the state of Florida. The first positive case of greening disease was in August 2005, when a greening positive citrus tree was discovered in Miami-Dade County. It was at this time the entire Florida citrus industry changed its citriculture practices overnight. Intensive pesticide applications, aggressive removal of citrus greening positive trees, and the complete switch from outdoor to indoor citrus nursery operations transpired.

===Symptoms===
Symptoms of citrus greening are numerous, and can be varied in citrus trees. A tree will develop yellow shoots instead of the expected deep green colors. The disease presents itself on the leaves by giving an asymmetrical blotchy-mottle appearance. This is the key diagnosing characteristic of citrus greening. On affected limbs, fruit tend to be lopsided. The fruit will also never ripen and have a sour taste, making them unmarketable for both juice and fresh fruit productions. In later stages of infection the tree will suffer from heavy leaf drop, high percentages of fruit drop, and deep twig die back. A greening positive citrus tree&#x27;s canopies will be airy due to the defoliation the disease causes. After a tree becomes infected with citrus greening it becomes uneconomical and may die within 2–5 years.

===Ecology of spread===
Vector control of citrus greening began when the disease was first introduced in 2005. All commercial citrus growers are advised in applying two dormancy pesticide sprays. These broad-spectrum pesticide sprays are applied in winter when adult psyllid populations decline to almost exclusive overwintering adults. With this strategy, significant reductions of populations withhold for up to 6 months. This fact is crucial as it protects the spring flush, which accounts for over 70% of new leaves for the year, from the infectious psyllid attacks. The spring flush typically occurs 3 months past winter. More aggressive citrus grove care-takers may employ a wide host of pesticides to try to keep psyllid populations low year round. These growers may spray pesticides up to seven times a year rotating various pesticides to employ different modes of actions against the psyllid. This is done in an attempt to prevent resistances of psyllids to the various pesticides. The spraying of pesticides is the only method of control for the citrus greening vector, the psyllid. It is impossible to kill all psyllids through pesticides; thus, strategic timing of pesticide sprays is done to try to slow the gradual spread of HLB throughout the citrus grove. Unfortunately, at this time it is inevitable that a commercial citrus grove will reach 100 percent infection rates even with aggressive sprays.

===New care-taking strategies===
Productivity of a citrus groves can be retained at pre-Huanglongbing levels through a three pronged strategy. Current research is aimed at the goal of giving the greatest yields for the lowest costs. Indeed, these lower costs are necessitated by the increased per acre cost of caretaking brought upon by Huanglongbing infection. Huanglongbing forces the commercial citrus caretaker to spray his/her block of citrus many more times a year than normal, considerably increasing costs. Per pound prices of citrus must continue increasing for citrus to remain profitable due to disease pressure.

Foliar fertilizers are now being sprayed on citrus trees at considerably higher rates than before citrus greening disease. Inspiration for the mixture of foliar nutrients was drawn from a local citrus grower, Maury Boyd. Mr. Boyd was the first to try a strategy of not removing greening positive citrus trees, and instead attempt aggressive nutritional sprays. His grove was as a result the first to remain economical with a high percentage rate of greening disease infection. His spray program is under considerable research by the University of Florida’s IFAS department. Further research is still needed, and being carried out to determine which specific fertilizer compounds, and the quantities used are the most efficient. Soil applied fertilizers appear to hold promise as well. In two-year studies carried out by the University of Florida’s IFAS department a combination of sulfur, zinc, manganese, iron and boron applied three times a year to the base of the tree are promising. The third year of research should be available in 2019.

Vector control of the psyllid, which is the sole means for citrus greening to spread is now done routinely. Before citrus greening disease was introduced, commercial citrus growers did not have to spray pesticides targeting insects. Current research is aimed at pesticide application timing, and pesticide choice for efficacy.

After the introduction of citrus greening disease, all commercial nurseries, where new young trees are purchased, were relocated indoors and a bud wood registration program was enacted. Previously young citrus trees were grown outdoors before disease pressure became an issue. This is to certify that Florida grove owners are able to purchase clean citrus trees for the planting of citrus groves. A greening positive young citrus tree will never reach maturity, even with intensive sprays.

These keystone citriculture practices vector control, soil and foliar nutrition, and certified young trees make up the new best management practices for commercial citrus growers against the citrus greening disease fight. A total management approach appears to provide the best hope of reducing financial impact of this disease. Currently, the best hope for the industry is resistant varieties. The challenge for the commercial producer is to identify low cost strategies that can prolong infected trees until they can be replaced.

== Citrus nutrition ==

=== Citrus malnutrition ===
Nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus are the main macronutrients needed in citrus production, as well as calcium, magnesium and sulfur.

*Nitrogen: Nitrogen is important for overall tree and leaf growth and peel thickness, and fruit acidity.
*Phosphorus: Phosphorus improves root growth, fruit yield and weight and juice while it reduces peel thickness.
*Potassium: Potassium maintains fruit size, acidity, juice and disease tolerance, and it is taken up largely by the citrus fruit; too little K can lead to splitting and plugging of the fruit.

=== Citrus micronutrients ===

Citrus micronutrients include boron, copper, iron and managanese.

*Boron is involved in many enzymatic systems, when it is deficient, the tree suffers in fruit and leaf quality, and the tree loses apical dominance.
*Copper affects photosynthesis and fruit set. Deficiency causes drooping of shoots, &quot;brown gum&quot; eruptions, and death may occur from the tip. If copper based fungicides are used, this is not usually a problem.
*Iron acts as a catalyst for reactions, this element is a cofactor for many enzymes, important for sweetness, increasing total soluble solids and boosting vitamin C and juice content for fruit. Iron deficiency is the most common of the micronutrients, causing symptoms of increased prominence of leaf veins and leaves turning white.
*Manganese deficiency is associated with zinc and iron reductions as well, causing a mottled yellowing of the leaf, almost of a variegated quality. It improves overall sugar production in fruit juice.

<text>Peter Pilkington, Baron Pilkington of Oxenford (5 September 1933 – 14 February 2011) was a British Anglican priest, public school headmaster and Conservative member of the House of Lords.

==Education==
Pilkington was educated at Dame Allan&#x27;s School, Newcastle, where he became religious and developed both his love of scholarship and his combative personality. In 1952 he went up to Jesus College, Cambridge and read history, being influenced by Conservative-minded figures such as Maurice Cowling, Herbert Butterfield and Michael Oakeshott. He graduated in 1955, and took his MA in 1959.

==Ecclesiastical career==
Pilkington trained for ordination at Westcott House, Cambridge, and was ordained as a deacon in the Diocese of Derby in 1959, and as a priest the following year. He served for three years as curate at the historic parish church of All Saints&#x27;, Bakewell during the incumbency of George Sinker.

He left parochial work to take up his first school chaplaincy position. In 1975 he was appointed an honorary canon of Canterbury Cathedral.

==Educational career==
In 1962 Pilkington became a schoolmaster at Eton College, teaching history, and a college chaplain. Later he became Conduct (senior chaplain), and for 10 years also served as Master in College, the housemaster of the scholars&#x27; house, until his resignation in 1975.

He was Headmaster of The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury from 1975 to 1986.

His final appointment in education was the post of High Master of St Paul&#x27;s School, London, from 1986 to 1992.

==Retirement==
Following his retirement from education Pilkington was appointed Chairman of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, serving from 1992 to 1996.

In 1995, he was made a life peer as Baron Pilkington of Oxenford, of West Dowlish in the County of Somerset.

He also assisted in retirement as an honorary curate of St Mary&#x27;s, Bourne Street, a prominent Anglo-Catholic church in Pimlico, where he served from 1992 to 2005.

Although his entire teaching career was spent in the private sector, Pilkington was a vociferous supporter of selective state education. During his retirement he served for several years as Chairman of the National Grammar Schools Association.

==Personal life==
In 1966 Pilkington married Helen Wilson, who predeceased him in 1997. He was survived by two daughters, Celia and Sarah Pilkington.

<text>The National Laboratory of Psychical Research was established in 1926 by Harry Price, at 16 Queensberry Place, London. Its aim was &quot;to investigate in a dispassionate manner and by purely scientific means every phase of psychic or alleged psychic phenomena&quot;. The honorary president was Lord Sands, K.C., LL.D., acting president was H. G. Bois, and the honorary director was Harry Price. In 1930 the Laboratory moved from Queensberry Square, where it had been a tenant of the London Spiritualist Alliance to 13 Roland Gardens. In 1938, its library was transferred on loan to the University of London.

The National Laboratory of Psychical Research was a rival to the Society for Psychical Research. Price had a number of disputes with the SPR, most notably over the mediumship of Rudi Schneider. Price paid mediums to test them, the SPR criticised Price and disagreed about paying mediums for testing.

In 1934 the Laboratory was replaced by the University of London Council for Psychical Investigation (not an official body of the University) under the Chairmanship of C. E. M. Joad with Harry Price as Hon. Secretary. John Flügel, Cyril Burt, Cecil Alec Mace and Francis Aveling were members of the Council. Price suspended the operations of the Council in 1938. It was never revived.

==Investigations==

===Eileen Garrett===
On October 7, 1930 it was claimed by spiritualists that Eileen J. Garrett made contact with the spirit of Herbert Carmichael Irwin at a séance held with Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research two days after the R101 disaster, while attempting to contact the then recently deceased Arthur Conan Doyle, and discussed possible causes of the accident. The event &quot;attracted worldwide attention&quot;, thanks to the presence of a reporter. Major Oliver Villiers, a friend of Brancker, Scott, Irwin, Colmore and others aboard the airship, participated in further séances with Garrett, at which he claimed to have contacted both Irwin and other victims. Price did not come to any definite conclusion about Garrett and the séances:

It is not my intention to discuss if the medium were really controlled by the discarnate entity of Irwin, or whether the utterances emanated from her subconscious mind or those of the sitters. &quot;Spirit&quot; or &quot;trance personality&quot; would be equally interesting explanations - and equally remarkable. There is no real evidence for either hypothesis. But it is not my intention to discuss hypotheses, but rather to put on record the detailed account of a remarkably interesting and thought-provoking experiment.

Garrett&#x27;s claims have since been questioned. The magician John Booth analysed the mediumship of Garrett and the paranormal claims of R101 and considered her to be a fraud. According to Booth Garrett&#x27;s notes and writings show she followed the building of the R101 and she may have been given aircraft blueprints from a technician from the airdrome. However, the researcher Melvin Harris who studied the case wrote no secret accomplice was needed as the information described in Garrett&#x27;s séances were &quot;either commonplace, easily absorbed bits and pieces, or plain gobblede- gook. The so-called secret information just doesn&#x27;t exist.&quot;

===Helen Duncan===
 In 1931, the National Laboratory of Psychical Research took on its most illustrious case. £50 was paid to the medium Helen Duncan so that she could be examined under scientific conditions. Price was sceptical of Duncan and had her perform a number of test séances. She was suspected of swallowing cheesecloth which was then regurgitated as &quot;ectoplasm&quot;. Price had proven through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan, that it was made of cheesecloth. Duncan reacted violently at attempts to X-ray her, running from the laboratory and making a scene in the street, where her husband had to restrain her, destroying the controlled nature of the test. Price wrote that Duncan had given her fake ectoplasm to her husband to hide. The ectoplasm of Duncan in another test was analysed by psychical researchers to be made from egg white. According to Price:

The sight of half-a-dozen men, each with a pair of scissors waiting for the word, was amusing. It came and we all jumped. One of the doctors got hold of the stuff and secured a piece. The medium screamed and the rest of the &quot;teleplasm&quot; went down her throat. This time it wasn&#x27;t cheese-cloth. It proved to be paper, soaked in white of egg, and folded into a flattened tube... Could anything be more infantile than a group of grown-up men wasting time, money, and energy on the antics of a fat female crook.

Price wrote up the case in &quot;Leaves from a Psychist’s Case Book&quot; (1933) in a chapter called &quot;The Cheese-Cloth Worshippers&quot;. Price in his report published photographs of Duncan in his laboratory that revealed fake ectoplasm made from cheesecloth, rubber gloves and cut-out heads from magazine covers which she pretended to her audience were spirits. Following the report written by Price, Duncan&#x27;s former maid Mary McGinlay confessed in detail to having aided Duncan in her mediumship tricks, and Duncan&#x27;s husband admitted that the ectoplasm materialisations to be the result of regurgitation. Later Duncan was caught cheating again pretending to be a spirit in the séance room. During Duncan&#x27;s famous trial in 1944, Price gave his results as evidence for the prosecution. This time Duncan and her travelling companions, Frances Brown, Ernest and Elizabeth Homer were prosecuted and convicted. Duncan was jailed for nine months, Brown for four months and the Homers were bound over.
===Rudi Schneider===

In 1920s and early 1930s Price investigated the medium Rudi Schneider in a number of experiments conducted at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research. Rudi claimed he could levitate objects but according to Price a photograph taken on April 28, 1932 showed that Rudi had managed to free his arm to move a handkerchief from the table. After this, many scientists considered Rudi to be exposed as a fraud. Price wrote that the findings of the other experiments should be revised due to the evidence showing how Rudi could free himself from the controls.

After Price had exposed Rudi, various scientists such Karl Przibram and the magician Henry Evans wrote to Price telling him that they agreed that Rudi would evade control during his séances and congratulated Price on the success of unmasking the fraud. In opposition, SPR members who were highly critical of Price, supported Rudi&#x27;s mediumship and promoted a conspiracy theory that Price had hoaxed the photograph. SPR member Anita Gregory suggested that Price had deliberately faked the photograph to discredit SPR research and ruin Rudi&#x27;s reputation. However, a photographic expert testified that the photograph was genuine. SPR member John L. Randall reviewed the Price and Schneider case and came to the conclusion the photograph was genuine, Price had caught Rudi in fraud.

===Others===

Price tested the trumpet medium Frederick Tansley Munnings at the laboratory who claimed to produce the independent &quot;spirit&quot; voices of Julius Caesar, Dan Leno, Hawley Harvey Crippen and King Henry VIII. Price invented and used a piece of apparatus known as a voice control recorder and proved that all the voices were those of Munnings. In 1928, Munnings admitted fraud and sold his confessions to a Sunday newspaper. Price also investigated the Italian chemist and medium Pasquale Erto in 1931. During the séances he utilised his knowledge of chemistry to produce luminous light effects. Traces of ferrocerium were discovered and Price concluded the phenomena were produced fraudulently.

In 1933, Frank Decker was investigated by the Price at the laboratory. Under strict scientific controls that Price contrived, Decker failed to produce any phenomena at all.

<text>A lattice is an abstract structure studied in the mathematical subdisciplines of order theory and abstract algebra. It consists of a partially ordered set in which every pair of elements has a unique supremum (also called a least upper bound or join) and a unique infimum (also called a greatest lower bound or meet). An example is given by the power set of a set, partially ordered by inclusion, for which the supremum is the union and the infimum is the intersection. Another example is given by the natural numbers, partially ordered by divisibility, for which the supremum is the least common multiple and the infimum is the greatest common divisor.

Lattices can also be characterized as algebraic structures satisfying certain axiomatic identities. Since the two definitions are equivalent, lattice theory draws on both order theory and universal algebra. Semilattices include lattices, which in turn include Heyting and Boolean algebras. These &quot;lattice-like&quot; structures all admit order-theoretic as well as algebraic descriptions.

The sub-field of abstract algebra that studies lattices is called lattice theory.

== Definition ==
A lattice can be defined either order-theoretically as a partially ordered set, or as an algebraic structure.

=== As partially ordered set ===
A partially ordered set (poset) formula_1 is called a lattice if it is both a join- and a meet-semilattice, i.e. each two-element subset formula_2 has a join (i.e. least upper bound, denoted by formula_3) and dually a meet (i.e. greatest lower bound, denoted by formula_4). This definition makes formula_5 and formula_6 binary operations. Both operations are monotone with respect to the given order: formula_7 and formula_8 implies that formula_9 and formula_10

It follows by an induction argument that every non-empty finite subset of a lattice has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. With additional assumptions, further conclusions may be possible; see &quot;Completeness (order theory)&quot; for more discussion of this subject. That article also discusses how one may rephrase the above definition in terms of the existence of suitable Galois connections between related partially ordered sets—an approach of special interest for the category theoretic approach to lattices, and for formal concept analysis.

Given a subset of a lattice, formula_11 meet and join restrict to partial functions – they are undefined if their value is not in the subset formula_12 The resulting structure on formula_13 is called a . In addition to this extrinsic definition as a subset of some other algebraic structure (a lattice), a partial lattice can also be intrinsically defined as a set with two partial binary operations satisfying certain axioms.

=== As algebraic structure ===
A lattice is an algebraic structure formula_14, consisting of a set formula_15 and two binary, commutative and associative operations formula_16 and formula_17 on formula_15 satisfying the following axiomatic identities for all elements formula_19 (sometimes called ):
formula_20
formula_21

The following two identities are also usually regarded as axioms, even though they follow from the two absorption laws taken together. These are called .
formula_22
formula_23

These axioms assert that both formula_24 and formula_25 are semilattices. The absorption laws, the only axioms above in which both meet and join appear, distinguish a lattice from an arbitrary pair of semilattice structures and assure that the two semilattices interact appropriately. In particular, each semilattice is the dual of the other. The absorption laws can be viewed as a requirement that the meet and join semilattices define the same partial order.

=== Connection between the two definitions ===
An order-theoretic lattice gives rise to the two binary operations formula_16 and formula_27 Since the commutative, associative and absorption laws can easily be verified for these operations, they make formula_14 into a lattice in the algebraic sense.

The converse is also true. Given an algebraically defined lattice formula_29 one can define a partial order formula_30 on formula_15 by setting
formula_32
formula_33
for all elements formula_34 The laws of absorption ensure that both definitions are equivalent:
formula_35
and dually for the other direction.

One can now check that the relation formula_36 introduced in this way defines a partial ordering within which binary meets and joins are given through the original operations formula_16 and formula_27

Since the two definitions of a lattice are equivalent, one may freely invoke aspects of either definition in any way that suits the purpose at hand.

== Bounded lattice ==
A bounded lattice is a lattice that additionally has a (also called , or element, and denoted by formula_39 or and a (also called , or , denoted by formula_40 or by which satisfy
formula_41

A bounded lattice may also be defined as an algebraic structure of the form formula_42 such that formula_14 is a lattice, formula_40 (the lattice&#x27;s bottom) is the identity element for the join operation formula_45 and formula_46 (the lattice&#x27;s top) is the identity element for the meet operation formula_27
formula_48
formula_49

A partially ordered set is a bounded lattice if and only if every finite set of elements (including the empty set) has a join and a meet. For every element formula_50 of a poset it is vacuously true that
formula_51 and
formula_52 and therefore every element of a poset is both an upper bound and a lower bound of the empty set. This implies that the join of an empty set is the least element formula_53 and the meet of the empty set is the greatest element formula_54 This is consistent with the associativity and commutativity of meet and join: the join of a union of finite sets is equal to the join of the joins of the sets, and dually, the meet of a union of finite sets is equal to the meet of the meets of the sets, that is, for finite subsets formula_55 and formula_56 of a poset formula_57
formula_58
and
formula_59
hold. Taking formula_56 to be the empty set,
formula_61
and
formula_62
which is consistent with the fact that formula_63

Every lattice can be embedded into a bounded lattice by adding a greatest and a least element. Furthermore, every non-empty finite lattice is bounded, by taking the join (respectively, meet) of all elements, denoted by formula_64 (respectively formula_65) where formula_66 is the set of all elements.

== Connection to other algebraic structures ==
Lattices have some connections to the family of group-like algebraic structures. Because meet and join both commute and associate, a lattice can be viewed as consisting of two commutative semigroups having the same domain. For a bounded lattice, these semigroups are in fact commutative monoids. The absorption law is the only defining identity that is peculiar to lattice theory. A bounded lattice can also be thought of as a commutative without the distributive axiom.

By commutativity, associativity and idempotence one can think of join and meet as operations on non-empty finite sets, rather than on pairs of elements. In a bounded lattice the join and meet of the empty set can also be defined (as formula_40 and formula_39 respectively). This makes bounded lattices somewhat more natural than general lattices, and many authors require all lattices to be bounded.

The algebraic interpretation of lattices plays an essential role in universal algebra.

== Examples ==

* For any set formula_69 the collection of all subsets of formula_55 (called the power set of formula_55) can be ordered via subset inclusion to obtain a lattice bounded by formula_55 itself and the empty set. In this lattice, the supremum is provided by set union and the infimum is provided by set intersection (see Pic. 1).
* For any set formula_69 the collection of all finite subsets of formula_69 ordered by inclusion, is also a lattice, and will be bounded if and only if formula_55 is finite.
* For any set formula_69 the collection of all partitions of formula_69 ordered by refinement, is a lattice (see Pic. 3).
* The positive integers in their usual order form an unbounded lattice, under the operations of &quot;min&quot; and &quot;max&quot;. 1 is bottom; there is no top (see Pic. 4).
* The Cartesian square of the natural numbers, ordered so that formula_78 if formula_79 The pair formula_80 is the bottom element; there is no top (see Pic. 5).
* The natural numbers also form a lattice under the operations of taking the greatest common divisor and least common multiple, with divisibility as the order relation: formula_81 if formula_82 divides formula_83 formula_46 is bottom; formula_40 is top. Pic. 2 shows a finite sublattice.
* Every complete lattice (also see below) is a (rather specific) bounded lattice. This class gives rise to a broad range of practical examples.
* The set of compact elements of an arithmetic complete lattice is a lattice with a least element, where the lattice operations are given by restricting the respective operations of the arithmetic lattice. This is the specific property that distinguishes arithmetic lattices from algebraic lattices, for which the compacts only form a join-semilattice. Both of these classes of complete lattices are studied in domain theory.

Further examples of lattices are given for each of the additional properties discussed below.
== Examples of non-lattices ==


Most partially ordered sets are not lattices, including the following.
* A discrete poset, meaning a poset such that formula_86 implies formula_87 is a lattice if and only if it has at most one element. In particular the two-element discrete poset is not a lattice.
* Although the set formula_88 partially ordered by divisibility is a lattice, the set formula_89 so ordered is not a lattice because the pair 2, 3 lacks a join; similarly, 2, 3 lacks a meet in formula_90
* The set formula_91 partially ordered by divisibility is not a lattice. Every pair of elements has an upper bound and a lower bound, but the pair 2, 3 has three upper bounds, namely 12, 18, and 36, none of which is the least of those three under divisibility (12 and 18 do not divide each other). Likewise the pair 12, 18 has three lower bounds, namely 1, 2, and 3, none of which is the greatest of those three under divisibility (2 and 3 do not divide each other).
== Morphisms of lattices ==

The appropriate notion of a morphism between two lattices flows easily from the above algebraic definition. Given two lattices formula_92 and formula_93 a lattice homomorphism from &quot;L&quot; to &quot;M&quot; is a function formula_94 such that for all formula_95
formula_96
formula_97

Thus formula_98 is a homomorphism of the two underlying semilattices. When lattices with more structure are considered, the morphisms should &quot;respect&quot; the extra structure, too. In particular, a bounded-lattice homomorphism (usually called just &quot;lattice homomorphism&quot;) formula_98 between two bounded lattices formula_15 and formula_101 should also have the following property:
formula_102
formula_103

In the order-theoretic formulation, these conditions just state that a homomorphism of lattices is a function preserving binary meets and joins. For bounded lattices, preservation of least and greatest elements is just preservation of join and meet of the empty set.

Any homomorphism of lattices is necessarily monotone with respect to the associated ordering relation; see Limit preserving function. The converse is not true: monotonicity by no means implies the required preservation of meets and joins (see Pic. 9), although an order-preserving bijection is a homomorphism if its inverse is also order-preserving.

Given the standard definition of isomorphisms as invertible morphisms, a is just a bijective lattice homomorphism. Similarly, a is a lattice homomorphism from a lattice to itself, and a is a bijective lattice endomorphism. Lattices and their homomorphisms form a category.

Let formula_104 and formula_105 be two lattices with 0 and 1. A homomorphism from formula_104 to formula_105 is called 0,1-&quot;separating&quot; if and only if formula_108 (formula_98 separates 0) and formula_110 (formula_98 separates 1).

== Sublattices ==
A of a lattice formula_15 is a subset of formula_15 that is a lattice with the same meet and join operations as formula_114 That is, if formula_15 is a lattice and formula_101 is a subset of formula_15 such that for every pair of elements formula_118 both formula_4 and formula_3 are in formula_121 then formula_101 is a sublattice of formula_114

A sublattice formula_101 of a lattice formula_15 is a of formula_57 if formula_127 and formula_128 implies that formula_129 belongs to formula_121 for all elements formula_131

== Properties of lattices ==

We now introduce a number of important properties that lead to interesting special classes of lattices. One, boundedness, has already been discussed.

=== Completeness ===

A poset is called a if its subsets have both a join and a meet. In particular, every complete lattice is a bounded lattice. While bounded lattice homomorphisms in general preserve only finite joins and meets, complete lattice homomorphisms are required to preserve arbitrary joins and meets.

Every poset that is a complete semilattice is also a complete lattice. Related to this result is the interesting phenomenon that there are various competing notions of homomorphism for this class of posets, depending on whether they are seen as complete lattices, complete join-semilattices, complete meet-semilattices, or as join-complete or meet-complete lattices.

&quot;Partial lattice&quot; is not the opposite of &quot;complete lattice&quot; – rather, &quot;partial lattice&quot;, &quot;lattice&quot;, and &quot;complete lattice&quot; are increasingly restrictive definitions.

=== Conditional completeness ===

A conditionally complete lattice is a lattice in which every subset has a join (that is, a least upper bound). Such lattices provide the most direct generalization of the completeness axiom of the real numbers. A conditionally complete lattice is either a complete lattice, or a complete lattice without its maximum element formula_39 its minimum element formula_133 or both.

=== Distributivity ===

Since lattices come with two binary operations, it is natural to ask whether one of them distributes over the other, that is, whether one or the other of the following dual laws holds for every three elements formula_134:

; Distributivity of formula_16 over formula_17
formula_137
; Distributivity of formula_17 over formula_16
formula_140

A lattice that satisfies the first or, equivalently (as it turns out), the second axiom, is called a distributive lattice.
The only non-distributive lattices with fewer than 6 elements are called M3 and N5; they are shown in Pictures 10 and 11, respectively. A lattice is distributive if and only if it does not have a sublattice isomorphic to M3 or N5. Each distributive lattice is isomorphic to a lattice of sets (with union and intersection as join and meet, respectively).

For an overview of stronger notions of distributivity that are appropriate for complete lattices and that are used to define more special classes of lattices such as frames and completely distributive lattices, see distributivity in order theory.

=== Modularity ===

For some applications the distributivity condition is too strong, and the following weaker property is often useful. A lattice formula_14 is if, for all elements formula_134 the following identity holds:
formula_143 ()&lt;br&gt;
This condition is equivalent to the following axiom:
formula_144 implies formula_145 ()&lt;br&gt;
A lattice is modular if and only if it does not have a sublattice isomorphic to N5 (shown in Pic. 11).
Besides distributive lattices, examples of modular lattices are the lattice of submodules of a module (hence &quot;modular&quot;), the lattice of two-sided ideals of a ring, and the lattice of normal subgroups of a group. The set of first-order terms with the ordering &quot;is more specific than&quot; is a non-modular lattice used in automated reasoning.

=== Semimodularity ===

A finite lattice is modular if and only if it is both upper and lower semimodular. For a graded lattice, (upper) semimodularity is equivalent to the following condition on the rank function formula_146
: formula_147
Another equivalent (for graded lattices) condition is Birkhoff&#x27;s condition:
: for each formula_50 and formula_149 in formula_57 if formula_50 and formula_149 both cover formula_153 then formula_154 covers both formula_50 and formula_156

A lattice is called lower semimodular if its dual is semimodular. For finite lattices this means that the previous conditions hold with formula_16 and formula_17 exchanged, &quot;covers&quot; exchanged with &quot;is covered by&quot;, and inequalities reversed.

=== Continuity and algebraicity ===

In domain theory, it is natural to seek to approximate the elements in a partial order by &quot;much simpler&quot; elements. This leads to the class of continuous posets, consisting of posets where every element can be obtained as the supremum of a directed set of elements that are way-below the element. If one can additionally restrict these to the compact elements of a poset for obtaining these directed sets, then the poset is even algebraic. Both concepts can be applied to lattices as follows:
* A continuous lattice is a complete lattice that is continuous as a poset.
* An algebraic lattice is a complete lattice that is algebraic as a poset.

Both of these classes have interesting properties. For example, continuous lattices can be characterized as algebraic structures (with infinitary operations) satisfying certain identities. While such a characterization is not known for algebraic lattices, they can be described &quot;syntactically&quot; via Scott information systems.

=== Complements and pseudo-complements ===

Let formula_15 be a bounded lattice with greatest element 1 and least element 0. Two elements formula_50 and formula_149 of formula_15 are complements of each other if and only if:
formula_163

In general, some elements of a bounded lattice might not have a complement, and others might have more than one complement. For example, the set formula_164 with its usual ordering is a bounded lattice, and formula_165 does not have a complement. In the bounded lattice N5, the element formula_82 has two complements, viz. formula_167 and formula_168 (see Pic. 11). A bounded lattice for which every element has a complement is called a complemented lattice.

A complemented lattice that is also distributive is a Boolean algebra. For a distributive lattice, the complement of formula_169 when it exists, is unique.

In the case that the complement is unique, we write formula_170 and equivalently, formula_171 The corresponding unary operation over formula_57 called complementation, introduces an analogue of logical negation into lattice theory.

Heyting algebras are an example of distributive lattices where some members might be lacking complements. Every element formula_129 of a Heyting algebra has, on the other hand, a pseudo-complement, also denoted formula_174 The pseudo-complement is the greatest element formula_149 such that formula_176 If the pseudo-complement of every element of a Heyting algebra is in fact a complement, then the Heyting algebra is in fact a Boolean algebra.

=== Jordan–Dedekind chain condition ===
A chain from formula_177 to formula_178 is a set formula_179 where formula_180
The length of this chain is &quot;n&quot;, or one less than its number of elements. A chain is maximal if formula_181 covers formula_182 for all formula_183

If for any pair, formula_50 and formula_185 where formula_186 all maximal chains from formula_50 to formula_149 have the same length, then the lattice is said to satisfy the Jordan–Dedekind chain condition.

=== Graded/ranked ===
A lattice formula_1 is called graded, sometimes ranked (but see Ranked poset for an alternative meaning), if it can be equipped with a rank function formula_190 sometimes to formula_191, compatible with the ordering (so formula_192 whenever formula_193) such that whenever formula_149 covers formula_169 then formula_196 The value of the rank function for a lattice element is called its rank.

A lattice element formula_149 is said to cover another element formula_169 if formula_199 but there does not exist a formula_129 such that formula_201
Here, formula_202 means formula_86 and formula_204

== Free lattices ==

Any set formula_205 may be used to generate the free semilattice formula_206 The free semilattice is defined to consist of all of the finite subsets of formula_207 with the semilattice operation given by ordinary set union. The free semilattice has the universal property. For the free lattice over a set formula_207 Whitman gave a construction based on polynomials over formula_205″s members.

== Important lattice-theoretic notions ==
We now define some order-theoretic notions of importance to lattice theory. In the following, let formula_50 be an element of some lattice formula_114 formula_50 is called:
* Join irreducible if formula_213 implies formula_214 for all formula_34 If formula_15 has a bottom element formula_133 some authors require formula_218. When the first condition is generalized to arbitrary joins formula_219 formula_50 is called completely join irreducible (or formula_16-irreducible). The dual notion is meet irreducibility (formula_17-irreducible). For example, in Pic. 2, the elements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are join irreducible, while 12, 15, 20, and 30 are meet irreducible. Depending on definition, the bottom element 1 and top element 60 may or may not be considered join irreducible and meet irreducible, respectively. In the lattice of real numbers with the usual order, each element is join irreducible, but none is completely join irreducible.
* Join prime if formula_223 implies formula_224 Again some authors require formula_218, although this is unusual. This too can be generalized to obtain the notion completely join prime. The dual notion is meet prime. Every join-prime element is also join irreducible, and every meet-prime element is also meet irreducible. The converse holds if formula_15 is distributive.

Let formula_15 have a bottom element 0. An element formula_50 of formula_15 is an atom if formula_230 and there exists no element formula_231 such that formula_232 Then formula_15 is called:
* Atomic if for every nonzero element formula_50 of formula_57 there exists an atom formula_82 of formula_15 such that formula_238
* Atomistic if every element of formula_15 is a supremum of atoms.
However, many sources and mathematical communities use the term &quot;atomic&quot; to mean &quot;atomistic&quot; as defined above.

The notions of ideals and the dual notion of filters refer to particular kinds of subsets of a partially ordered set, and are therefore important for lattice theory. Details can be found in the respective entries.

<doc id="469308" wikidata="Q2746341" url="?curid=469308" title="Ælfthryth (wife of Edgar)">
<text>Ælfthryth ( – 1000 or 1001, also Alfrida, Elfrida or Elfthryth) was Queen of the English from her marriage to King Edgar in 964 or 965 until Edgar&#x27;s death in 975. She was a leading figure in the regency during the minority of her son King Æthelred the Unready between 978 and 984.

Ælfthryth was the first wife of an English king known to have been crowned and anointed as queen. She had two sons with Edgar, the ætheling Edmund (who died young) and King Æthelred the Unready. Ælfthryth was a powerful political figure and possibly orchestrated the murder of her stepson, King Edward the Martyr, in order to place her son Æthelred on the throne. She appeared as a stereotypical bad queen and evil stepmother in many medieval histories.

==Early life==

Ælfthryth was the daughter of Ordgar, Ealdorman of Devon. Her mother was a member of the royal family of Wessex. The family&#x27;s power lay in the west of Wessex. Ordgar was buried in Exeter and his son Ordwulf founded, or refounded, Tavistock Abbey.

Ælfthryth was first married to Æthelwald, son of Æthelstan Half-King as recorded by Byrhtferth of Ramsey in his Life of Saint Oswald of Worcester. Later accounts, such as that preserved by William of Malmesbury and Geoffrey Gaimar, add vivid detail of unknown reliability.

According to William and Geoffrey, the beauty of Ordgar&#x27;s daughter Ælfthryth was reported to King Edgar. Edgar, looking for a Queen, sent Æthelwald to see Ælfthryth, ordering him &quot;to offer her marriage [to Edgar] if her beauty were really equal to report.&quot; When she turned out to be just as beautiful as was said, Æthelwald married her himself and reported back to Edgar that she was quite unsuitable. Edgar was eventually told of this, and decided to repay Æthelwald&#x27;s betrayal in like manner. He said that he would visit the poor woman, which alarmed Æthelwald. He asked Ælfthryth to make herself as unattractive as possible for the king&#x27;s visit, but she did the opposite. According to William, Edgar, quite besotted with her, killed Æthelwald during a hunt. Geoffrey instead states that Edgar posted Æthelwald to Northumbria where he was attacked and killed by outlaws.

The historical record does not record the year of Æthelwald&#x27;s death, let alone its manner. No children of Æthelwald and Ælfthryth are known.

==Queen consort==
Edgar had two children before he married Ælfthryth, both of uncertain legitimacy. Edward was probably the son of Æthelflæd, and Eadgifu, later known as Saint Edith of Wilton, was the daughter of Wulfthryth. Sound political reasons encouraged the match between Edgar, whose power base was centred in Mercia, and Ælfthryth, whose family were powerful in Wessex. In addition to this, and her link with the family of Æthelstan Half-King, Ælfthryth also appears to have been connected to the family of Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia.

Edgar married Ælfthryth in either 964 or 965. In 966 Ælfthryth gave birth to a son who was named Edmund. In King Edgar&#x27;s charter (S 745) regranting privileges to New Minster, Winchester that same year, the infant Edmund is called &quot;clito legitimus&quot; (legitimate ætheling), and appears before Edward in the list of witnesses. Edmund died young, 970, but in 968 Ælfthryth had given birth to a second son who was called Æthelred.

King Edgar organised a second coronation on 11 May 973 at Bath, perhaps to bolster his claim to be ruler of all of Britain. Here Ælfthryth was also crowned and anointed, granting her a status higher than any recent queen. The only model of a queen&#x27;s coronation was that of Judith of Flanders, but this had taken place outside England. One of the emphases of the new rite was her role as protector of religion and the nunneries in the realm. The queen&#x27;s responsibility for the kingdom&#x27;s nunneries had been established by the &quot;Regularis Concordia&quot;, a rule for religious life composed by Ælfthryth&#x27;s close ally, Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester, as part of the wider English Benedictine Reform. Ælfthryth took a close interest in the well-being of several abbeys, and is reported by Goscelin to have used her authority to depose and later reinstate the abbess of Barking Abbey.

Ælfthryth played a large role as &quot;forespeca&quot;, or advocate, in at least six legal cases. As such, she formed a key part of the Anglo-Saxon legal system as a mediator between the individual and the crown, which was increasingly viewing its role in the courts as a symbol of its authority as protector of its subjects. Ælfthryth&#x27;s actions as &quot;forespeca&quot; were largely for the benefit of female litigants, and her role as a mediator shows the possibilities for women to have legal and political power in late Anglo-Saxon England.

==Queen dowager==

Edgar died in 975 leaving two young sons, Edward and Æthelred. Edward was almost an adult, and his successful claim for the throne was supported by many key figures including Archbishops Dunstan and Oswald and the brother of Ælfthryth&#x27;s first husband, Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia. Supporting the unsuccessful claim of Æthelred were Ælfthryth herself (now the Queen dowager) Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester, and Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia.

According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, King Edward was killed at Corfe Castle on 18 March 978, while visiting Ælfthryth. Accounts written over subsequent centuries suggest that he may have been killed by servants of the queen, leaving the way clear for her son Æthelred to be installed as king. As the king developed into a cult figure and martyr, a body of literature grew up around his murder, at first implying Ælfthryth&#x27;s guilt and later accusing her outright. The 12th century monastic chronicle the &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot; went so far as to accuse her of being a witch, claiming that she had murdered not only the king, but also Abbot Brihtnoth of Ely.

==Queen regent==
Within a year of his brother&#x27;s death Æthelred was confirmed as king of the English. Due to Æthelred&#x27;s youth, Ælfthryth served as regent for her son until his coming of age around 984. She was partnered in this regency by her allies Bishop Æthelwold and Ealdorman Ælfhere, but both had died by 984 and Æthelred rebelled against his old advisers, preferring a group of younger nobility. In charter S 745, dated to 966, Ælfthryth was identified as &#x27;legitimate wife of the king&#x27;, after being crowned queen in 973 she witnessed charters as &#x27;Ælfðryð regina&#x27;. She was absent as a witness during the reign of her step-son King Edward, and during the minority of her son King Æthelred, again witnessed charters as &#x27;Ælfðryð regina&#x27; (see charter S 843). Towards the end of 983, when King Æthelred was beginning to assert his own authority, she began to sign charters as &quot;Ælfthryth, mother of the king&quot; (see charter S 845).

==Later life==
Ælfthryth disappears from the list of charter witnesses from around 984 (S 855). About this time Æthelred married and there was a new queen in the court, Ælfgifu. Ælfthryth reappears as a witness in 993 (S 876), again as &#x27;mother of the king&#x27;. She remained an important figure, being responsible for the care of Æthelred&#x27;s children by his first wife, Ælfgifu. Æthelred&#x27;s eldest son, Æthelstan Ætheling, prayed for the soul of the grandmother &#x27;who brought me up&#x27; in his will in 1014 (S 1503).

Although her reputation was damaged by the murder of her stepson, Ælfthryth was a religious woman, taking an especial interest in monastic reform during her queenship. William of Malmesbury reports that she founded both Amesbury Abbey and Wherwell Abbey as Benedictine nunneries, though the foundation histories of both abbeys are poorly attested and there no extant endowment charters. Late in life, according to Gaimar, Ælfthryth retired to Wherwell.

Antonia Gransden comments: &#x27;In their patronage of the monks both Cnut and Edward the Confessor were supported by their queens, Emma and Edith, who were worthy successors of Edgar&#x27;s queen, Ælfthryth, as patronesses of the religious.&#x27; She died at Wherwell on 17 November 999, 1000 or 1001.

<text>Scion was a marque of Toyota that debuted in 2003 and was available only in the United States and Canada. The marque was intended to appeal to younger customers: the Scion brand emphasized inexpensive, stylish, and distinctive sport compact vehicles, and used a simplified &quot;pure price&quot; sales concept that eschewed traditional trim levels and dealer haggling. Each vehicle was offered in a single trim with a non-negotiable base price, while a range of dealer-installed options was offered to buyers for personalizing their vehicles. The &quot;&quot; name, meaning the descendant of a family or heir, refers both to the brand&#x27;s cars and their owners. In an effort to target millennials, Scion primarily relied on guerrilla and viral marketing techniques.

The brand first soft launched in the United States at selected Toyota dealers in the state of California in June 2003, before expanding nationwide by February 2004. Sales peaked in 2006 with 173,034 units sold. In 2010, Scion expanded into Canada. However, Toyota&#x27;s initial propositions of short product cycles and aggressive pricing based on low dealer margins became increasingly unsustainable as sales fell after the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Toyota abolished the Scion brand at the start of the 2017 model year in August 2016; the vehicles were either rebranded as Toyotas or discontinued.

==History==
In 1999, Toyota launched Project Genesis, an effort to bring younger buyers to the Toyota marque in the United States. This project aimed to create a &quot;marque within a marque&quot; in sales and advertising strategy for compact and coupe models sold by Toyota. The effort, which included the introduction of the Toyota Echo economy car, along with late generation Toyota MR-2 and Toyota Celica models, was judged unsuccessful and cancelled in 2001. In response, Toyota chose to launch a separate marque, an effort called Project Exodus. A Los Angeles-based digital design company, Fresh Machine, was retained by Toyota to develop the brand, logo, and website. This project became known as Scion. Toyota had previously participated in a project in Japan with other Japanese companies who attempted to market products to younger buyers. Toyota manufactured three vehicles under the WiLL brandname, which were exclusive to &quot;Toyota Netz Store&quot; Japanese dealerships.

Scion was marketed as a youth brand and was first introduced in March 2002, at the New York Auto Show. There were just two concept vehicles, the bbX (which became the xB), and the ccX (which became the tC). The 2004 xA and xB were unveiled at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show on January 2, 2003. They were available only in 105 Toyota dealerships in California at their initial launch on June 9, 2003. The subsequent rollout of the brand to the South, the Southeast, and the East Coast occurred in February 2004. Scion vehicles were available nationwide in June 2004, coinciding with the release of the 2005 tC. On December 16, 2006, Scion unveiled the next-generation xB, based on the t2B concept, and the new xD, successor of the xA, at an invitation-only, no-camera event in Miami. Both cars were then publicly unveiled on February 8, 2007, at the Chicago Auto Show. The xD, a five-door subcompact car that is sold in Japan as the second generation Toyota Ist, was based on the Yaris platform with the tenth-generation Corolla&#x27;s engine.

In September 2010, Scion expanded into Canada, with vehicles offered at 45 selected dealers starting in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, followed by other cities. Launch models included the tC, xD, and xB. The first new Scions were shown in Canada at the 2009 Montreal International Auto Show.

===Struggles===
Sales of the Scion brand were down to a low of 45,678 for the 2010 model year, compared to over 170,000 for 2006. The management tried to resuscitate the brand, hoping to sell 35,000 to 45,000 tC in a year after the model was redesigned for 2011. In October 2011, the iQ, an ultra-compact city car, debuted as a 2012 model. In April 2012, Jack Hollis (Vice President of Scion) announced that the xB and xD would be dropped after 2012, supposedly in favor of all new models from Toyota&#x27;s hatchback division, Daihatsu; the same month, the FR-S sports car went on sale as a 2013 model. Later in 2012—despite the announcement of its imminent discontinuation—a facelifted version of the xB was unveiled.

In late 2013, the xD and second-generation xB were in their seventh year without a substantial redesign, and Scion sales were still far short of their 2006 peak. Toyota began allowing dealers to drop the Scion marque without penalty. The recently introduced FR-S had strong initial sales, but combined sales of the new FR-S and redesigned tC did not equal sales of the tC alone during 2005 through 2008, and industry observers concluded that the FR-S was cannibalizing sales of the similar tC. iQ sales never met expectations, and by 2014, observers were characterizing it as a &quot;disappointment.&quot; A primary goal of the Scion brand was to introduce young first-time buyers to Toyota products, but analysts found that relatively few Scion buyers were making follow-on purchases from the more profitable Toyota and Lexus lines, and Gen Y buyers were generally making more pragmatic car-buying choices than their predecessors due to economic factors.

For the 2015 model year, Scion released the iM hatchback, based on the international Toyota Auris, and the iQ, xB, and xD were discontinued. Scion also introduced the iA sedan, a rebadged version of the Mazda2; however, Toyota opted to sell the iA as the Toyota Yaris sedan in Canada.

===Discontinuation===
On February 3, 2016, Toyota announced that the Scion brand would be phased out in August after the 2016 model year, stating that the company no longer required a specific marque to target younger demographics. The FR-S, iA, and iM models were amalgamated into the Toyota marque for the 2017 model year as the Toyota 86, Toyota Yaris iA, and Toyota Corolla iM respectively, while the tC was discontinued. The then-upcoming C-HR was also moved to the Toyota marque after originally being unveiled as a Scion. The change was not expected to cause disruption to service options, as Scion models were sold and serviced at Toyota dealerships.

==Lineup==
==Pricing, accessories, and availability==
Scion used sales tools such as &quot;Pure Price&quot; and monospec trim levels with a wide selection of factory and TRD accessories. Extensive market research and testing with Generation Y consumers formed the basis of the Scion badge.

&quot;Pure Price&quot; means that the price posted, whether on the vehicle, in an advertisement, or on a menu display board in the dealership, was the price customers would pay. This included the vehicle, accessories, finance and insurance products. Pure Price was designed to ensure a shorter and simpler process, eliminating all negotiation, though it was common for dealers to add aftermarket accessories and mark vehicles up to increase profits. The concept aimed to be open and consistent to all customers. The concept was not new to the U.S. market, having been introduced in the early 1990s by the Geo and Saturn marques of General Motors.

Scion&#x27;s sales approach differed greatly from that of the Toyota brand. In the United States, for instance, the Toyota Camry was offered with four different trim levels intended for different crowds (budget-conscious, mainstream, sports-oriented and luxury); all Scions, in contrast, had only one standard trim level (monospec) and were designed to be uniquely customized for the driver.
==Post-production accessories==
Scion offered about 150 different accessories; other after-market companies through the Optōmize Scion program offer to add other accessories, as well. For example, one can add a subwoofer as well as different types of decals. The tC had offered an optional supercharger to increase power from 161 to 200 hp (120 to 150 kW), but this option was since discontinued in 2007 due to early failure of the bearings inside the centrifugal blower. All accessories are sold individually, and do not require special packages. However, some options, such as Ground Effects, do prevent other accessories (such as mud flaps) from being installed.
Companies that participated in the Optōmize Scion program include GReddy, OBX, RÄZO, a few car detailing companies, and others.

== Release series ==

Beginning in the second quarter of 2004 with the launch of the 2004 Scion xB RS 1.0 (Release Series 1.0), followed by the Scion xA RS 1.0, Scion decided to create limited edition vehicles pre-packaged with exclusive accessories in limited quantities. Limited Edition vehicles from a marketing standpoint were used to create a buzz for the brand name, with their exterior colors tending to be loud or bright hues (e.g. orange, yellow, red, blue, green). Because of the growing popularity of the Scion product line and the scarce production runs (most dealers only get 2-3 of each RS model), these limited edition vehicles quickly sold out. Pre-ordering is available at each dealership on a first-come, first-served basis. To the customer&#x27;s benefit, Scion&#x27;s &quot;Pure Price&quot; MSRP bounds dealerships against market-demand vehicle mark-up. Naturally, resale values of Release Series vehicles command a premium because of their packaged options and scarcity.

==Target market==
In 2007, the median age of a Toyota consumer was 54 years old. Comparatively, Scion&#x27;s average buyer age at that time was lowest in the industry, at 39.

Initially, Scion&#x27;s first two cars (the xA and xB), while unusual for American roads, were well received among consumers not interested in standard entry-level vehicles. The tC was also well received with brisk sales.

The marque&#x27;s best-selling year was 2006, with 173,000 vehicles sold. Sales dropped in the ensuing years, to 57,961 vehicles in 2009. By 2010, the tC was the mainstay of the brand, accounting for over 40% of all Scions sold since the brand was established. However, some sales of the second-generation tC were cannibalized by the similar FR-S. In the U.S., sales of the xB declined after the introduction of the second generation, from a peak of over 60,000 to 17,017 in 2011; sales of the xD fell to 9,573 in 2011 from 32,603 in 2006.

By the time it was discontinued, over a million Scion-branded cars were sold. Over 70% were sold to people new to Toyota and just over 50% of the cars sold were to people under the age of 35; tC buyers had an average age of 29, the lowest in the industry.

==Advertising==
To advertise Scion, Toyota began a promotional campaign using a form of guerrilla marketing, using posters and ads in movie theaters and TV to direct consumers to its various &quot;want2bsquare&quot; web sites. Scion&#x27;s marketing endeavors extended to sponsorships, such as that of VBS.tv&#x27;s show, &quot;Thumbs Up!&quot;, which featured David Choe hitchhiking across the United States. Scion sponsored two commercials featuring Concours race car driver Matt Verbin during the Castle Hill Concours d&#x27;Elegance, showing him racing a custom painted yellow and orange xB on Cambridge streets. Scion also teamed with Gaia Online, providing the xB, xD, and tC as a choice for user cars, as well as other things across the site.

Scion also used smaller, regional viral campaigns to reach niche demographics. Online campaigns such as &quot;Scion xPressionism&quot; allowed a user to modify and design their own Scion with graphics, decals, and aftermarket car parts. Online advertising, much of it quirky and offbeat, was part of Scion&#x27;s marketing mix for both these campaigns and for the launch of new models. Shows like &quot;Slick&#x27;s Picks&quot; went around the country interviewing artists, stores, and events and put short videos on the site. &quot;Scion Radio 17&quot; was an internet-radio initiative that features 17 non-mainstream channels, ranging from rock and hip hop to electro and soul. Scion AV served as the brand&#x27;s lifestyle marketing initiative, funding projects in music, art, and film.

In August 2008, Scion released the &quot;United by Individuality&quot; ad campaign, featuring over 300 Scion owners&#x27; vehicles in various magazine articles, commercials, and billboards. The latest commercial video showed a convoy of Scions parading through the desert in Boulder City, Nevada. These videos and ads could be seen on Scion&#x27;s website.

== Biography ==
Feldman was born in September 1923 to Tilly (née Katz; 1902–1977) and Philip Feldman, and was educated at the Grocers&#x27; School. Feldman began his first business in 1946, with Richard Beecham. Feldman was a former member of Lloyd&#x27;s of London, and was the director of The Young Entrepreneurs Fund from 1985 to 1994. He has been described as a former plastic-toy magnate whose business interests reportedly included &quot;Sindy dolls, aircraft kits and yo-yos&quot;. Feldman married his wife Gita Julius in 1952. His younger sister was Fenella Fielding, the actress. He had two sons and a daughter. One of his sons is Nick Feldman, bass guitarist of the band Wang Chung. Feldman was a member of the Garrick and Carlton Clubs.

He was knighted in 1982. On 15 January 1996, he was made a life peer as Baron Feldman, of Frognal in the London Borough of Camden. His sponsors were Margaret Thatcher and Cecil Parkinson, and he was introduced to the House of Lords on 14 February 1996.

<doc id="469317" wikidata="Q3785852" url="?curid=469317" title="Hispano-Suiza 12Z">
<text>The 12Z, designated Type 89 by the company, was the final production evolution of the series of Hispano-Suiza V-12 aircraft engines. The Z model was in the middle of development when France fell to the Germans during World War II. A small number were produced before and during the war but following the occupation of Vichy France, the German occupation government did not allow full-scale production to start. After the war development would resume and small numbers were built to equip new designs, but the rapid introduction of the jet engine ended further development.

==Design and development==
The 12Z differed from the earlier 12Y primarily in the use of four valves per cylinder operated by dual overhead cams, as opposed to two valves operated by a single camshaft. This gave the cylinders considerably better volumetric efficiency and faster operation, raising the RPM from 2,400 to 2,700. As with the later variants of the 12Y, the engine was designed to run on 100 octane fuel as well as operate at a higher 7.0:1 compression ratio. After the initial prototypes, fuel injectors built by Lavalette-Bosch would replace the original carburetors, raising the power from 1,000 to 1,300 hp (750 to 970 kW) at sea level.

The engine continued to use a single-stage, single-speed centrifugal supercharger and therefore lacked the all-altitude performance of German and British designs. But swapping the mediocre HS No.1 supercharger for the larger Szydlowsky-Planiol supercharger tuned for a higher critical altitude improved high-altitude performance considerably, delivering 1,500 hp (1,120 kW) at as opposed to 930 hp (690 kW) at for the 12Y-45.

Small prototype runs started in 1939, and were fitted to the French Air Force&#x27;s front-line fighter aircraft, the M.S.410 and D.520, creating the M.S.450 and D.524 respectively. Production of the main model, the 12Zter, was still not ready at the time of the armistice when the factory had to move from Bois-Colombes to Tarbes. The earliest full-scale production order of 70 engines was placed in 1941, intended to support the first half of an order for 105 D.520Zs that was not permitted by the occupation government. Initial production instead was undertaken in Hispano-Suiza&#x27;s Spanish factories in Barcelona where they were intended for the HA-1109. In 1943, La Hispano-Suiza received an order for 120 engines from the Spanish Air Force, but by late 1947 only 50 were completed. Rather than operate with 100/130 octane fuel as used by the French, the Spanish 12Zs were tuned to operate with 92 octane fuel. The lower grade fuel the power dropped slightly to 1,280 hp (950 kW) at 2,600 rpm (1,479 hp (1,100 kW) maximum take-off). Of these first 50 12Zs, three would be given to France post-war to speed up aircraft development.

Development would continue in Barcelona after the occupation of Southern France in 1942, but then would return to France after liberation in 1944. With the reestablishment of Hispano-Suiza in France, development and production would quickly pick back up in 1945 with the 12Z-17 family of engines and end in 1950 after producing about 200 engines. Spanish production would continue in 1948 with Hispano-Suiza partnered with ENASA for an order of 280 new 12Z-17s and 50 rebuilt 12Z-M. Of the 70 incomplete engines from the prior order, ENASA delivered 12 12Zs by 1950 and converted 58 to 12Z-Ms. Due to poor reliability and schedule issues, the order for 280 engines was reduced to 100, and only 104 12Z-17s were delivered by 1955 when the contract was canceled.

==Variants==
With development and production being split between La Hispano Suiza of Barcelona and Hispano Suiza of Bois-Colombes and Tarbes, there were multiple designations for the same model created for the 12Z and its variants. Spanish serial numbers were in the 50XXX range and French serial numbers were in the 10XXX range.

===Type 89===

:Also called the 12Z-II, design fitted with a 2-speed Turbomeca supercharger, proposed for enhanced CASA 2.111 or S-49 variants.

===Type 91===
;12Z-15
:12Z-17 fitted with a larger 340 mm output gear instead of 300 mm, dedicated variant for VB 10.
;12Z-16
:12Z-18 fitted with a larger 340 mm output gear instead of 300 mm, dedicated variant for VB 10.

==Applications==

<text>The Hummingbird Highway is one of the four major highways in Belize. It connects the George Price Highway outside of Belmopan, Cayo District to the Southern Highway outside of Dangriga, Stann Creek District. It partially follows, and sometimes uses the infrastructure of, the former Stann Creek Railway (see Rail transport in Belize).

A paving project was completed in 1994. All the citrus produced in Belize travels along this highway to the two major processing plants in Stann Creek district. There are quite a few small villages along the highway. A new bridge was completed over the Sibun River in 2004, and a new bridge inaugurated in 2006 across Silver Creek; however, there are still quite a few one-lane dilapidated bridges over numerous creeks and streams.

The traffic along the Hummingbird Highway has been on the increase lately due to an increase in demand for eco-tourism and the passage of petroleum trucks, which use the Highway as a shortcut en route to the George Price Highway (which terminates at the Guatemala border). The Hummingbird Highway is the only Highway in Belize which cuts through the mountains of Belize. The highway rests in a valley which comprises citrus orchards in the lowland and untouched jungle habitat on the outskirts and beyond.

<doc id="469319" wikidata="Q2749491" url="?curid=469319" title="Church Square, Pretoria">
<text>Church Square (Afrikaans: Kerkplein), originally Market Square (Dutch: Marktplein), is the square at the historic centre of the city of Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa. The founder of Pretoria, Marthinus Pretorius, determined that the square be used as a market place and church yard. It was subsequently named for the church buildings that stood at the centre of the square from 1856 to 1905. The square&#x27;s most prominent feature, since June 1954, is the statue of the late Boer leader and president of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger, at its centre. Statues of four anonymous Boer citizen-soldiers surround that of Kruger on a lower level of the plinth.

==Current buildings==
Several historically and architecturally significant buildings surround the square: the Palace of Justice, the Old Capitol Theatre, the Tudor Chambers, the Ou Raadsaal (Old Council Chamber) and the General Post Office, which was designed by William Hawke.

==2014 revamping project==
In keeping with the historical value of the square, a rejuvenation project was announced in 2014 in the old Raadsaal. Roads around the square would be converted for exclusive use by the A Re Yeng (&quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;) bus service and its service vehicles, while pedestrian areas would be made more public-friendly. The defunct south wall&#x27;s fountain head would be restored and trees would be planted around the square. Numerous street benches would be provided and the square&#x27;s tar walkways would be replaced with slate. The Kruger statues at the centre of the square would remain, and the square will be closed for hawkers.

==History==
===Market===
Produce was conveyed to the Market Square by wagon, where their owners&#x27; oxen were also outspanned. The produce, if not sold direct from the wagon, would be placed on the ground amidst the trek oxen and the cattle and horses for sale. A first market shed was erected by the municipality after 1910 which led to a legal battle between the Pretoria Market and Estate Company and the town council. This was finally decided by Lord de Villiers at Bloemfontein, whose verdict gave the council control over 3/4 of the square, while the Market and Estate Company retained control of the Market Hall and buildings on the square&#x27;s north-western corner for about another 40 years. The building of further sheds and the paving of the Market Square c.1917 were consequences of Lord de Villiers&#x27; verdict.

Lines for horse-drawn trams initially connected the railway station with Market, Church, du Toit and Esselen streets to the terminus at the east end of de Kock Street. This company ceased operations at the outbreak of war in 1899, and it was not until c.1904 that the municipality purchased their concession and restarted it. Only in November 1910 were electric trams put into operation.

===Churches===
The square became known as Church Square due to a succession of three churches that stood at the center of the square. The first church on Church Square was built in 1856 by Skinner and Devereux, and inaugurated in 1857. This was replaced by a larger building, which burnt down in 1882. This simple Cape Dutch style building was replaced by an early Gothic style building, built by Claridge, together with Leslie Simmonds. This third church building, known as the Verenigde Kerk, was demolished in 1904/1905, shortly after president Paul Kruger&#x27;s state funeral was conducted from it.

===Fountain===
According to a &quot;Minute of His Worship the Mayor (Andrew Johnson) for the Mayoral Year ending 25th October 1905, Municipality of Pretoria&quot;, a fountain was proposed for the square by Mr. Samuel Marks. This piece in turn was moved to the Pretoria Zoo, making way for the current collection of sculptures.

===Rivonia trial===
The turreted Palace of Justice was the scene of arguably the most famous political trial in South Africa&#x27;s history, the Rivonia Trial. During this trial, Nelson Mandela and a number of other ANC members were charged with treason, found guilty and subsequently incarcerated.

<doc id="469323" wikidata="Q5326335" url="?curid=469323" title="Earl of Morley">
<text>Earl of Morley, of Morley in the County of Devon, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1815 for John Parker, 2nd Baron Boringdon. At the same time he was created Viscount Boringdon, of North Molton in the County of Devon, which is used as a courtesy title by the heir apparent to the earldom. It does not seem to have any connection with Baron Morley of Morley in Norfolk, held by another Parker family in the 16th century.

==Appellation of Morley==
There existed between 1299 and 1697 an ancient Barony of Morley first held by the de Morley family, lords of the manor of Morley Saint Botolph in Norfolk, which passed in 1489 by marriage to the Parker family, apparently unrelated to the Parker family of Saltram, Devon which latter had emerged in the 16th century from seemingly humble origins in North Molton in Devon. It can thus be no co-incidence that in 1815 John Parker, 2nd Baron Boringdon (1772–1840), on his elevation to the dignity of an earl in 1815, chose the title Earl of Morley, ostensibly referring to his recent purchase of the relatively minor Devon manor of Morley (modern spelling Moreleigh), midway between Totnes and Kingsbridge. It had become common in the 19th century for members of the post-mediaeval nobility when elevated further in the peerage to adopt defunct mediaeval titles which bore some ostensible link to the family, thus lending it an air of great antiquity. Such actions were often adopted in all innocence based on erroneous pedigrees produced by genealogists overly eager to please their patrons. An example is the Russell family, Dukes of Bedford, of which a younger son when himself elevated to the peerage adopted the title &quot;Baron Russell of Kingston Russell&quot;, an ancient Dorset manor with which his family had in fact no historic connection.

==Baron Boringdon==
 
The title of Baron Boringdon, of Boringdon in the County of Devon, was created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1784 for the first earl&#x27;s father, John Parker, who had previously represented Bodmin and Devon in the House of Commons.

Lord Morley was succeeded by his only son, the second Earl. He held minor office in the first Whig administration of Lord John Russell. His son, the third Earl, was a Liberal politician and notably served under William Ewart Gladstone as Under-Secretary of State for War and as First Commissioner of Works. His grandson, the sixth Earl, succeeded his uncle in 1962 (who in his turn had succeeded his elder brother in 1951). He was the eldest son of John Holford Parker, third and youngest son of the third Earl. Lord Morley served as Lord Lieutenant of Devon from 1982 to 1998. He was succeeded by his only son in 2015.

The family seat was Saltram House in Plymouth. It was sold to the National Trust in 1957 and remained the family seat until the fifth Earl died in 1962. Their seat is now Pound House, near Yelverton, Devon.

==Barons Boringdon (1784)==
*John Parker, 1st Baron Boringdon (died 1788)
*John Parker, 2nd Baron Boringdon (1772–1840) (created Earl of Morley in 1815)

==Earls of Morley (1815)==
*John Parker, 1st Earl of Morley (1772–1840)
*Edmund Parker, 2nd Earl of Morley (1810–1864)
*Albert Edmund Parker, 3rd Earl of Morley (1843–1905)
*Edmund Robert Parker, 4th Earl of Morley (1877–1951)
*Montagu Brownlow Parker, 5th Earl of Morley (1878–1962)
*John St Aubyn Parker, 6th Earl of Morley (1923–2015)
*Mark Lionel Parker, 7th Earl of Morley (b. 1956)
==Present peer==
Mark Lionel Parker, 7th Earl of Morley (born 22 August 1956) is the only son of the 6th Earl and his wife Johanna Katherine Molesworth-St. Aubyn, a daughter of Sir John Molesworth-St Aubyn, 14th Baronet. Styled formally as Viscount Boringdon between 1962 and 2015, he was educated at Eton College and was commissioned into the Royal Green Jackets, rising to the rank of Captain. In 2003, his address was Pound House, Yelverton, Devon.

On 20 September 2015 he succeeded as Earl of Morley, Viscount Boringdon, and Baron Boringdon of Boringdon.

On 12 November 1983, as Boringdon, he married Carolyn Jill McVicar, a daughter of Donald McVicar, and they have three daughters:
*Lady Alexandra Louise Parker (1985)
*Lady Olivia Clare Parker (1987)
*Lady Helena Georgia Parker (1991)

The heir presumptive is the present peer&#x27;s first cousin, Edward Geoffrey Parker (born 1967), only son of Nigel Geoffrey Parker, younger brother of the 6th Earl, whose heir apparent is his son Oliver James Parker (born 1996).

<doc id="469324" wikidata="Q1824163" url="?curid=469324" title="Volumetric efficiency">
<text>Volumetric efficiency (VE) in internal combustion engine engineering is defined as the ratio of the equivalent volume of the fresh air drawn into the cylinder during the intake stroke (if the gases were at the reference condition for density) to the volume of the cylinder itself. The term is also used in other engineering contexts, such as hydraulic pumps and electronic components.

==Internal combustion engines==
Volumetric Efficiency in an internal combustion engine design refers to the efficiency with which the engine can move the &quot;charge&quot; of fresh air into and out of the cylinders. It also denotes the ratio of equivalent air volume drawn into the cylinder to the cylinder&#x27;s swept volume. This equivalent volume is commonly inserted into a mass estimation equation based upon Boyle&#x27;s Gas Law. When VE is multiplied by the cylinder volume, an accurate estimate of cylinder air mass (charge) can be made for use in determining the required fuel delivery and spark timing for the engine.

The flow restrictions in the intake and exhaust systems create a reduction in the inlet flow which reduces the total mass delivery to the cylinder. Under some conditions, ram tuning may either increase or decrease the pumping efficiency of the engine. This happens when a favorable alignment of the pressure wave in the inlet (or exhaust) plumbing improves the flow through the valve. Increasing the pressure differential across the inlet valve typically increases VE throughout the naturally aspirated range. Adding intake manifold boost pressure from a supercharger or turbocharger can increase the VE, but the final calculation for cylinder airmass takes most of this benefit into account with the pressure term in n=PV/RT which is taken from the intake manifold pressure.

Many high performance cars use carefully arranged air intakes and tuned exhaust systems that use pressure waves to push air into and out of the cylinders, making use of the resonance of the system. Two-stroke engines are very sensitive to this concept and can use expansion chambers that return the escaping air-fuel mixture back to the cylinder. A more modern technique for four-stroke engines, variable valve timing, attempts to address changes in volumetric efficiency with changes in speed of the engine: at higher speeds the engine needs the valves open for a greater percentage of the cycle time to move the charge in and out of the engine.

Volumetric efficiencies above 100% can be reached by using forced induction such as supercharging or turbocharging. With proper tuning, volumetric efficiencies above 100% can also be reached by naturally aspirated engines. The limit for naturally aspirated engines is about 130%; these engines are typically of a DOHC layout with four valves per cylinder. This process is called inertial supercharging and uses the resonance of the intake manifold and the mass of the air to achieve pressures greater than atmospheric at the intake valve. With proper tuning (and dependent on the need for sound level control), VE&#x27;s of up to 130% have been reported in various experimental studies.

More &quot;radical&quot; solutions include the sleeve valve design, in which the valves are replaced outright with a rotating sleeve around the piston, or alternately a rotating sleeve under the cylinder head. In this system the ports can be as large as necessary, up to that of the entire cylinder wall. However, there is a practical upper limit due to the strength of the sleeve, at larger sizes the pressure inside the cylinder can &quot;pop&quot; the sleeve if the port is too large.

==Hydraulic pumps==
Volumetric efficiency in a hydraulic pump refers to the percentage of actual fluid flow out of the pump compared to the flow out of the pump without leakage. In other words, if the flow out of a 100cc pump is 92cc (per revolution), then the volumetric efficiency is 92%. The volumetric efficiency will change with the pressure and speed a pump is operated at, therefore when comparing volumetric efficiencies, the pressure and speed information must be available. When a single number is given for volumetric efficiency, it will typically be at the rated pressure and speed.

==Electronics==

In electronics, volumetric efficiency quantifies the performance of some electronic function per unit volume, usually in as small a space as possible. This is desirable since advanced designs need to cram increasing functionality into smaller packages, for example, maximizing the energy stored in a battery powering a cellphone. Besides energy storage in batteries, the concept of volumetric efficiency appears in design and application of capacitors, where the &quot;CV product&quot; is a figure of merit calculated by multiplying the capacitance (C) by the maximum voltage rating (V), divided by the volume. The concept of volumetric efficiency can be applied to any measurable electronic characteristic, including resistance, capacitance, inductance, voltage, current, energy storage, etc.

<text>is a Japanese film studio located in Bunkyō. The name &quot;Nikkatsu&quot; amalgamates the words Nippon Katsudō Shashin, literally &quot;Japan Motion Pictures&quot;.

Shareholders are Nippon Television Holdings (35%) and SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation (28.4%).

==History==

===Founding in 1912===
Nikkatsu is Japan&#x27;s oldest major movie studio, having been founded on September 10, 1912, when several production companies and theater chains, Yoshizawa Shōten, Yokota Shōkai, Fukuhōdō and M. Pathe, consolidated under the name Nippon Katsudō Shashin. The company enjoyed its share of success. It employed such notable film directors as Shozo Makino and his son Masahiro Makino.

During World War II, the government ordered the ten film companies that had formed by 1941 to consolidate into two. Masaichi Nagata, founder of Daiei Film and a former Nikkatsu employee, counter-proposed that three companies be formed and the suggestion was approved. Nikkatsu, set to merge with the two weakest companies, Shinkō Kinema and Daito, were verbally displeased. The committee formed to establish the value of each company retaliated by purposefully undervaluing Nikkatsu, which led to Shinkō becoming the dominant head of production. The reformed Nikkatsu continued to prosper as an exhibition company but ceased all film production.

The postwar film industry expanded rapidly and, in 1951, Nikkatsu president Kyusaku Hori began construction of a new production studio. A graduate of Tokyo Keizai University, Hori had joined the company in 1951 after quitting his initial employment as the manager of Sanno Hotel (now rebuilt as Sanno Park Tower).

===Golden Age===

Under Hori, Nikkatsu is considered to have had its &quot;Golden Age&quot;. The company began making movies again in 1954. Many assistant directors from other studios, including Shōhei Imamura and Seijun Suzuki from Shochiku, moved to Nikkatsu with the promise of advancement to full director status within one or two years. Suzuki made dozens of films for Nikkatsu from 1956 onwards, developing an increasingly inventive visual style, but was controversially fired following the release of his 40th, &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; (1967), which Hori deemed &quot;incomprehensible&quot;.

The company made a few samurai films and historical dramas but by 1960 had decided to devote its resources to the production of urban youth dramas, comedy, action and gangster films. From the late 1950s to the start of the 1970s, they were renowned for their &quot;borderless action&quot; (&quot;mukokuseki akushun&quot;) movies, designed for the youth market, whose directors included Suzuki, Toshio Masuda, and Takashi Nomura. The studio also employed such stars as Yujiro Ishihara, Akira Kobayashi, Joe Shishido, Tetsuya Watari, Ruriko Asaoka, Chieko Matsubara and, later, Meiko Kaji and Tatsuya Fuji. Director Shōhei Imamura began his career there and between 1958 and 1966 made for them such notable films as &quot;Pigs and Battleships&quot; (1961), &quot;The Insect Woman&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Pornographers&quot; (1966).

===Daikaiju genre===
Strangely during the height of the popularity of Japan&#x27;s 1960s daikaiju (giant monster) genre, Nikkatsu only produced one Godzilla-type monster movie, 1967&#x27;s &quot;Daikyoju Gappa&quot; (&quot;Giant Beast Gappa&quot;), released internationally as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Monster from a Prehistoric Planet&quot;, a film generally regarded as a remake of the 1961 British film &quot;Gorgo&quot;.

===Roman Porno===
By 1971 the increased popularity of television had taken a heavy toll on the film industry and in order to remain profitable Nikkatsu turned to the production of Roman Porno, which focus on sex, violence, S&amp;M and romance. Hori resigned over the change in focus, and many stars and directors left the company. A few, including the film directors Yasuharu Hasebe, Keiichi Ozawa, Shōgorō Nishimura, and Koreyoshi Kurahara, stayed. It also witnessed the emergence of such new directors as Tatsumi Kumashiro, Masaru Konuma and Chūsei Sone.

Between 1974 and 1986, Nikkatsu promoted a number of their leading Roman Porno actresses of the popular BDSM niche under the epithet . They include Naomi Tani (1974–1979), Junko Mabuki (1980–1981), Izumi Shima (1982–1983), Nami Matsukawa (1983), Miki Takakura (1983–1985), and Ran Masaki (1985-1986).

The advent of home video brought an end to active production at Nikkatsu. &quot;Bed Partner&quot; (1988) was the last release in the venerable 17-year Roman Porno series. Nikkatsu declared bankruptcy in 1993.

===Sushi Typhoon===
In 2005, the company was sold to Index Holdings and in 2010, a revived Nikkatsu studio announced new production of Sushi Typhoon, a movie series made in partnership with a U.S. distributor. The Sushi Typhoon arm of Nikkatsu creates low-budget horror, science fiction, and fantasy films aimed at an international audience. By 2011, the company had produced seven feature films.

<doc id="469334" wikidata="Q4793936" url="?curid=469334" title="June Lloyd, Baroness Lloyd of Highbury">
<text>June Kathleen Lloyd, Baroness Lloyd of Highbury (1 January 1928 – 28 June 2006) was a British paediatrician and, in retirement, a cross bench member of the House of Lords. June Lloyd was a determined advocate for children&#x27;s health and was instrumental in the establishment of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. In 1996, the college gained its royal status. She was also known for discovering that the damage caused to patients by the rare metabolic disease oQ-betalipoproteinaemia, that could be avoided by the use of Vitamin E. She was also known for discovering the role of lipid metabolism in health and disease in childhood, which was original and difficult to investigate at that time.

==Early life and education==
Lloyd was born in Gilgit, Kashmir, where her father was a Major in the Royal Indian Army Service Corps. She remained in India until 1936, when her family returned to England. She was educated at the Royal High School in Bath, where she became head girl. She read medicine at the University of Bristol, winning honours with distinction and a gold medal.

==Career==
She joined the Royal College of Physicians in 1954 and became one the youngest female members After further study in South Shields, Bristol, Plymouth, Oxford, Manchester and Durham, she became a research assistant to Otto Herbert Wolff in Birmingham. She taught at the University of Birmingham from 1958 to 1965, specialising in metabolic disorders in children, particularly diabetes mellitus and childhood obesity.

In 1965, she followed Wolff to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, and the associated Institute of Child Health at University College London where she became a senior lecturer, later a reader and finally professor.

Lloyd was appointed professor of child health and head of a new department of paediatrics at St George&#x27;s Hospital Medical School in London in 1975, and returned to Great Ormond Street in 1985 as Nuffield Professor of Child Health. She served with distinction on many committees. She was the first female president of the British Paediatric Association from 1988 to 1991, and was a vice-president of the Royal College of Physicians from 1992 to 1995.

===Establishment of the RCPCH===
Lloyd retired from practising medicine in 1992, but played a role in transforming the British Paediatric Association (abbr. BPA) into the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. It was originally thought that Lloyd would become president of the BPA, after being honorary secretary for a number of years, but Lloyd believed that the paediatricians should have their own college. She was a member of an influential group with the BPA, which enabled her to push for the establishment of a new college. It was a contentious issue, as many in the profession believed it was not necessary, and there was serious differences of opinion, when looking in hindsight. 

Sir Peter Tizard and his research group at Hammersmith Hospital, were one group of dissenting voices, who believed that Paediatrics should have the same intellectual footing for medicine for children, as medicine for adults, within general medicine, rather than a speciality. However, the argument was won. Roy Meadow would become the first president, but she would feature on the coat of arms of the new college, in which she is a supporter holding a staff of Aesculapius entwined with a double helix rather than the traditional snake. The other supporter was Thomas Phaire, whose &quot;Boke of Chyldren&quot; from 1545 was the first book on paediatrics in English, the crest is a baby, taken from the arms of the Foundling Hospital in Coram&#x27;s Fields. Lloyd took over responsibility for training and standards for paediatricians that had previously been under the control of the Royal College of Physicians.

==Awards and honours==
* Appointed a DBE in 1990
* Honorary DSc from Bristol University in 1991
* Honorary DSc from Birmingham University in 1993
* Awarded the James Spence Medal in 1993
* Life peer as &quot;Baroness Lloyd of Highbury&quot;, of Highbury in the London Borough of Islington in 1996.

==Later life and death==
A severe stroke before her introduction to the House of Lords prevented her taking her seat until 1998. Her resulting disability left her unable to become an active member of the House. She had never married. Her brother, Philip Lloyd, was a Commander in the Royal Navy.

<doc id="469342" wikidata="Q979434" url="?curid=469342" title="Earl of St Germans">
<text>Earl of St Germans, in the County of Cornwall, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom that is held by the Eliot family. The title takes its name from the village of St Germans, Cornwall, and the family seat is Port Eliot. The earldom has the subsidiary title of Baron Eliot.

==History==
Edward Eliot represented St Germans, Liskeard and Cornwall in the House of Commons and served as a commissioner of the Board of Trade and Plantations. He was the son of Richard Eliot (died 1748) and his wife Harriot, illegitimate daughter of James Craggs the Younger by his mistress, the noted actress Hester Santlow. In 1784 he was created Baron Eliot, of St Germans in the County of Cornwall, in the Peerage of Great Britain. In 1789 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Craggs. However, this surname has not been used by any of his descendants.

Lord Eliot&#x27;s first son died in infancy; his second son, Edward James Eliot, also predeceased him, and he was succeeded by his third son, John Eliot, 2nd Baron Eliot, who in 1815 was created Earl of St Germans with remainder to his younger brother William Eliot and the heirs male of his body. The first earl had earlier represented St Germans and then Liskeard in Parliament.

William, the second Earl, was a diplomat and politician, having notably served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. His only son, the third Earl, was also a prominent politician and held ministerial office as Chief Secretary for Ireland, Postmaster General, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland and Lord Steward of the Household. His third but eldest surviving son, the fourth Earl, was in the Diplomatic Service and briefly represented Devonport in the House of Commons. In 1870 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Eliot. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl.

Henry, the fifth Earl, was in the Foreign Office for many years. This line of the family failed on the death of his second but eldest surviving son, the sixth Earl, in 1922. The late Earl was succeeded by his first cousin, the seventh Earl. He was the eldest son of Colonel Charles George Cornwallis Eliot, the sixth son of the third Earl. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He held several positions at court, notably as Gentleman Usher to King Edward VII and King George V.

, the titles are held by the eleventh Earl, who succeeded his grandfather in 2016.

<text>The mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx) is a large Old World monkey native to west central Africa. It is one of the most colorful mammals in the world, with red and blue skin on its face and posterior. The species is sexually dimorphic, as males have a larger body, longer canine teeth and brighter coloring. It is the largest monkey in the world. Its closest living relative is the drill, with which it shares the genus &quot;Mandrillus&quot;. Both species were traditionally thought to be baboons, but further evidence has shown that they are more closely related to white-eyelid mangabeys.

Mandrills mainly live in tropical rainforests but will also travel across savannas. They are active during the day and spend most of their time on the ground. Their preferred foods are fruit and seeds, but mandrills will consume leaves, piths, mushrooms, and animals from insects to juvenile bay duiker. Mandrills live in large, stable groups known as &quot;hordes&quot; which can number in the hundreds. Females form the core of these groups, while adult males are solitary and only reunite with the larger groups during the breeding season. Dominant males have the most vibrant colors and fattest flanks and rumps, and have the most success siring young.

The mandrill is classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Its biggest threats are habitat destruction and hunting for bushmeat. Gabon is considered the stronghold for the species. Its habitat has declined in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, while its range in the Republic of the Congo is limited.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;mandrill&quot; is derived from the English words &quot;man&quot; and &quot;drill&quot;—the latter meaning or and being West African in origin—and dated to 1744. The name appears to have originally referred to chimpanzees. The first scholar to record the name for the colorful monkey was Georges-Louis Buffon in 1766. It was called the &quot;tufted ape&quot;, &quot;great baboon&quot; and &quot;ribbernosed baboon&quot; by Thomas Pennant in &quot;A Synopsis of Quadrupeds&quot; (1771) and &quot;A History of Quadrupeds&quot; (1781).

==Taxonomy==
The mandrill was first scientifically depicted in &quot;Historia animalium&quot; (1551–1558) by Conrad Gessner, who considered it a kind of hyena. The species was formally classified by Carl Linnaeus as &quot;Simia sphinx&quot; in 1758. Its current generic name &quot;Mandrillus&quot; was coined by Ferdinand Ritgen in 1824.

Historically, some scientists placed the mandrill and the closely related drill (&quot;M. leucophaeus&quot;) in the baboon genus &quot;Papio&quot;. Morphological and genetic studies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries found a closer relationship to white-eyelid mangabeys of the genus &quot;Cercocebus&quot;. Some have even proposed that the mandrill and drill belong to &quot;Cercocebus&quot;. Two genetic studies in 2011 clarified &quot;Mandrillus&quot; and &quot;Cercocebus&quot; as separate sister lineages. The two genera split around 4.5 million years ago (mya) while the mandrill and drill split approximately 3.17 mya. Fossils of &quot;Mandrillus&quot; have not been found.

Some authorities have divided mandrill populations into subspecies: the northern mandrill (&quot;M. s. sphinx&quot;) and the southern mandrill (&quot;M. s. madarogaster&quot;). A proposed third subspecies, &quot;M. s. insularis&quot;, was based on the mistaken belief that mandrills are present on Bioko Island. The consensus is that mandrills belong to one subspecies (&quot;M. s. sphinx&quot;).

Cytochrome-b sequences suggest that mandrill populations north and south of the Ogooué River split 800,000 years ago and belong to distinct haplogroups. This divergence appears to have also led to the splitting of the mandrill strain of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The draft (incomplete) genome of the mandrill was published in 2020, with a reported genome size of 2.90 giga–base-pairs and high levels of heterozygosity.

==Characteristics==

The mandrill has a stocky body with a large head and muzzle, as well as a short and stumpy tail. The limbs are evenly sized and the fingers and toes are more elongated than those in baboons, with a more opposable big toe on the feet. The mandrill is the most sexually dimorphic primate, and it is the largest monkey. Females are less stocky and have shorter, flatter snouts. Males have a head-body length and weigh while females have a head-body length and weigh . Most of the teeth are larger in males, and the canine teeth reach up to and long for males and females respectively. Both sexes have long tails.
The coat of the mandrill is primarily grizzled or banded olive-brown with a yellow-orange beard and sparse, light hairs on its underside. The lips are surrounded by stiff white whiskers, and white bare skin exists behind the ears. Male mandrills have a &quot;crest&quot; of long hairs on the head and neck, while both sexes have chest glands which are covered by long hairs. The face, rump and genitals have less hair. The mandrill has a red line running down the middle of their face which connects to their red nose. On either side of the line, the skin is blue and grooved. In males, the blue skin is supported by ridged bone swellings. Females have more subdued facial coloring, but this can vary between individuals with some having stronger red and blue hues and others being darker or almost black. In males, the rump and areas around the genitals are multi-colored, consisting of red, pink, blue and purple skin, with a red penis shaft and violet scrotum. The genital and anal areas of the female are red.

The mandrill is among the most colorful mammals. Charles Darwin wrote in &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;: &quot;no other member of the whole class of mammals is coloured in so extraordinary a manner as the adult male mandrill&quot;. The red coloration is created by blood vessels near the surface of the skin, while the blue is a form of structural coloration caused by parallel arrangements of collagen fibers. The blue ridges on males contrast with both the red facial hues and the green foliage of their environment, helping them stand out to other individuals. The darker and more subdued coloring of female faces is caused by melanin.

==Ecology==

The mandrill lives in west-central Africa, including southern Cameroon, mainland Equatorial Guinea (Río Muni), Gabon and parts of the Republic of the Congo. Its range is bounded by the Sanaga River to the north and the Ogooué and Ivindo Rivers to the east. It does not appear to share habitat with the drill, as the two species are separated by the Sanaga River. Mandrills live in tropical rainforests, generally preferring primary forests over secondary forests. They also live in patchy gallery forests surrounded by savanna and travel across grass areas within their forest habitats. They have also been recorded in mountainous areas, near rivers and in cultivated fields.

Mandrills prefer thick bush dominated by perennial plants like gingers and plants of the genera &quot;Brillantaisia&quot; and &quot;Phaulopsis&quot;. They mainly dwell on the ground, but feed as high as the canopy. Both mandrills and drills are more arboreal than baboons. Mandrills may aggregate or compete with other primates such as talapoins, guenons, mangabeys, black-and-white colobuses, chimpanzees, and gorillas.

===Feeding===
The mandrill is an omnivore. The core of its diet consists of plants, of which it eats over a hundred species. One study found the mandrill&#x27;s diet was composed of fruit (50.7%), seeds (26.0%), leaves (8.2%), pith (6.8%), flowers (2.7%), and animal matter (4.1%), with other foods making up the remaining 1.4%. During the wet season, mandrills forage in continuous forest, when fruit is most available, while during the dry season they feed in gallery forests and at the borders of savannas and forests.

The mandrill&#x27;s preferred fruits include those of the cashew species &quot;Pseudospondias microcarpa&quot;, the coffee species &quot;Nauclea diderrichii&quot; and the wort species &quot;Psorospermum febrifugum&quot;. Mandrills consume more seeds than many other primate species. Adult male mandrills are one of the few primates capable of biting through the hard shell of &quot;Detarium microcarpum&quot; seeds. For vegetation, they mostly eat the young leaves, shoots and piths of monocot plants. In particular, mandrills consume leaves from the arrowroots &quot;Haumania liebrechtsiana&quot; and &quot;Trachyphrynium braunianum&quot;, as well as the piths of ginger plants like &quot;Renealmia macrocolia&quot; and species in the genus &quot;Aframomum&quot;. They are also known to consume mushrooms.

The rest of a mandrill&#x27;s diet is largely made up of invertebrates, particularly ants, termites, crickets, spiders, snails, and scorpions. They also eat birds and their eggs, frogs and rodents. Mandrills have been recorded preying on larger vertebrates such as juvenile bay duikers. Such prey is killed with a bite to the head followed by pulling off the hind limbs and tearing open the belly. Individuals may cooperate during hunting and share kills.

===Predators, parasites and pathogens===
Leopards may prey on mandrills, as traces of mandrill have been found in their feces. Other potential predators include African rock pythons, crowned eagles and chimpanzees. Leopards are a threat to all individuals, while eagles are only threats to the young. In a study where a mandrill group was exposed to models of leopards and crown eagles, the leopard models tended to cause the mandrills to flee up trees while the eagles were more likely to drive them to take cover. The dominant male did not flee from either model types; in the case of the leopards, he paced around while looking in their direction. Alarm calls were more commonly heard in response to leopards than eagles.

Mandrills can become infected with gastrointestinal parasites, such as nematodes and protozoa. Tumbu fly larvae may live under the skin and individuals that walk though grassland can get infested with ticks. Blood parasites include the malaria-causing &quot;Plasmodium&quot; and the nematode &quot;Loa loa&quot;, which is transmitted by bites from deer flies. Wild mandrills have tested positive for SIV, enteroviruses of the species EV-J and astroviruses, including a human variant.

==Behavior and life history==

Mandrills are mostly diurnal and are awake around 10 hours per day from morning to dusk. They often pick a new tree to sleep in every night. Mandrills have been observed using tools; in captivity, they use sticks to clean themselves. In the wild, mandrills appear to live 12–14 years, but captive individuals can live 30–40 years.

===Social structure===
Mandrills live in large &quot;supergroups&quot; or &quot;hordes&quot; that can contain hundreds of individuals. These large groups are fairly stable and do not appear to be gatherings of smaller ones. At Lopé National Park, Gabon, mandrill hordes were found to have an average of 620 individuals, and some groups were as large as 845, making them possibly the largest cohesive groups of wild primates. Another study in Lopé found that a horde of 625 mandrills consisted of 21 dominant males, 71 less dominant and subadult males, 247 adult and adolescent females, 200 juveniles, and 86 dependent infants. A mandrill horde of around 700 individuals in northern Lopé had a total home range of , of which was suitable habitat. The supergroup would occasionally diverge into two to four subgroups before reuniting. Another 15-month long study of a 120-member group found a home range of with an average traveling distance of per day.

Hordes consist of matrilineal family groups, and females are important for maintaining social cohesion. Strong connections with their relatives may lead to support during conflicts, higher survival rate of offspring and a longer lifespan for females. Dominant females are at the center of the group network and their removal leads to fewer social connections in the group. The social rank of a mother mandrill can contribute to the social rank of both her female and male offspring. Mature males are not permanent members of hordes but join as females become sexually receptive and leave as their sexual cycle ends. As a result, the coloration of the male mandrill may be intended to attract attention in a social structure with no long-term relationships between mates. Higher ranking males are found in the center of a social group while lower ranking males are more likely to occupy the periphery. Females have some control over the males and coalitions can expel an unwanted male from a group. Outside the breeding season, males are believed to lead a solitary life and all-male bachelor groups are not known to exist.

Both male and female mandrills rub and mark trees and branches with secretions from their chest glands, though males (and especially dominant males) mark more than females. The chemicals in the secretions signal the individual&#x27;s sex, age and rank. Scent-marking may also serve a territorial function, captive alpha males will mark enclosure boundaries. Mandrills will groom one another, even when there is no benefit to be gained from doing so. During grooming, subordinates prefer to pick at other mandrills from behind, in order to minimize eye contact and give them more time to flee if the more dominant individual attacks. The recipients of grooming will try to maneuver the groomer to pick at more &quot;risky&quot; areas.

===Reproduction and development===

Dominant or alpha male mandrills have the most mating success. Upon gaining alpha status, males develop larger testicles, redder faces and posteriors, more secretion from the chest glands and fatter sides and rumps. When a male loses dominance, these physiological changes are at least partially reversed. The blue facial skin is more consistent in brightness. Higher ranking males tend to have more contrast between red and blue facial coloring. Due to their distribution of fat, dominant males are also known as &quot;fatted&quot; males while subordinate males are known as &quot;non-fatted&quot; males. Canine length also correlates with dominance, and males are less likely to sire offspring when their canines are under . In some individuals, the development of secondary sexual characteristics is suppressed in response to competition from other males. Male mandrills tend to establish dominance with vocalizations and facial expressions, rather than fighting.

Mating occurs mostly during the dry season, with female ovulation peaking between June and September. Receptive females have sexual swellings on their posteriors, and the red facial coloration can communicate age and fertility. Males also appear to detect a female&#x27;s reproductive state using the vomeronasal organ (known as the flehmen response). Dominant males try to monopolize access to females by mate guarding, which involves the male tending to and copulating with a female for days. Dominant males tend to sire most of the offspring, but they are less able to monopolize access to the females when many females reach estrus at the same time. A subordinate male is also more likely to have reproductive success if he is closely related to an alpha male. An ovulating female tends to allow the brightest colored males to come near her and touch her perineum, and is more likely to groom and solicit them. The female signals her willingness to mate by positioning her posterior towards the male. Intercourse lasts no more than 60 seconds, with the male mounting the female and making pelvic thrusts.

Mandrill gestation lasts an average of 175 days with most births taking place between January and March, during the wet season. Gaps in between births range from 184 to 1,159 days with an average of 405 days. and tend to be shorter in higher ranking females. Infants are born at an average weight of , and mostly bare-skinned with some white hair and a tuft of dark hair on the head and along the spine. Over the next two or three months, they develop their adult hair color on the body, limbs and head while the flesh-colored face and snout darken. Dependent infants are carried on their mothers&#x27; bellies. Young are typically weaned at around 230 days old. Males become more sexually dimorphic between four and eight years old, at which point females are already beginning to give birth. Males start leaving their horde after they reach six years old. Females reach their adult size around seven years while males do so at ten years.

===Communication===
Mandrills communicate with various facial expressions and postures. Threat displays involve open mouth staring, usually in combination with head bobbing, ground slapping and raised hair. These gestures are usually performed by dominant individuals towards subordinates, who respond with bared teeth grimaces, signaling fear and aggression. Both young and low-ranking females show submission and anxiety with a pouting &quot;duck face&quot;. Playful intentions are communicated with a relaxed open-mouth face. Males approaching females display a &quot;grin&quot; or silent bared-teeth face and make lip-smacks. This display may also occur with teeth-chattering. Mandrills can develop and pass on new gestures; captive individuals at the Colchester Zoo, England facepalm to discourage being disturbed, particularly while resting.

Mandrills also produce several vocalizations, for both long and short distances. During group movements, adult males produce two-phase grunts and one-syllable roars, both of which are equivalent to the &quot;wahoo&quot; bark of baboons. Other group members produce &quot;crowings&quot;, which last almost two seconds and start as a vibration and transition into a longer harmonic sound. Short distance vocals include the &quot;yak&quot;, a sharp, repeating, pulse-like call produced by all individuals except for adult males and made in tense situations. Mandrills may also grunt during aggressive encounters. Growls are used to express mild alarm while intense alarms come in the form of a short, two-syllable sharp call known as the &quot;k-alarm&quot;. A sharp, loud &quot;K-sound&quot; is produced for unknown reasons. Screaming is a signal of fear and made by individuals fleeing, while the girney, a type of moan or purr, is made as a form of appeasement or frustration among females and young. Individual voices are more similar among related animals, but unrelated mandrills can have similar voices if they regularly interact.

==Threats and conservation==
As of 2019, the IUCN Red List lists the mandrill as vulnerable. Its total population is unknown but is suspected to have decreased by more than 30 percent over the last 24 years. Its main threats are habitat destruction and hunting for bushmeat. The mandrill appears to have suffered massive habitat loss in Equatorial Guinea and southern Cameroon, while its range in the Republic of the Congo is limited and its status is unknown. In addition, while mandrills live in groups numbering in the hundreds, hunting in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea appears to have led to smaller group sizes. Gabon is seen as the most important remaining refuge for the species, and the country&#x27;s low population density and vast rainforests make it a good candidate for mandrill conservation. Surveys have shown high population numbers for other primate species like chimpanzees and gorillas. A semi-wild population exists at the International Centre of Medical Research of Franceville.

The mandrill is listed under Appendix I by CITES, banning commercial trade in wild-caught specimens, and under Class B by the African Convention, which provides them protection but allows special authorization for their killing, capturing or collecting. There is at least one protected area for mandrills within each of the countries they inhabit. In Gabon, most of the rainforests have been leased to timber companies but around 10 percent is part of a national parks system, 13 of which were established in 2002.

<text>Earl of Stradbroke, in the County of Suffolk, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1821 for John Rous, 1st Baron Rous, who had earlier represented Suffolk in the House of Commons.

He had already succeeded his father as 6th Rous Baronet (of Henham) in 1771 and been created Baron Rous, of Dennington in the County of Suffolk, in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1796, and was made Viscount Dunwich, in the County of Suffolk, at the same time he was given the earldom. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl who notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Suffolk. Admiral Henry John Rous, was the second son of the first Earl.

The third Earl was Governor of Victoria from 1920 to 1926 as well as Lord Lieutenant of Suffolk. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Earl, who also served as Lord Lieutenant of Suffolk.

, the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s nephew, the sixth Earl, who succeeded his father the 5th Earl in 1983 and until 2016 lived at Mt Fyan&#x27;s Station, Dundonnell, Victoria, Australia, a 5,900 hectare (14,580 acre) ranch which he purchased in 1989 and sold in 2016 for $ Aus 34 million (£19 million). Lord Stradbroke has been married twice and has thirteen children. His younger brother is Lieutenant General Sir William Rous.

The seat of the Rous family from the early 14th century was Dennington Hall, Woodbridge (near Stradbroke) in Suffolk, in 2015, the residence of Robert Charles Rous, a grandson of the 3rd Earl. The family seat of Henham Hall, near Blythburgh, Suffolk, was demolished in 1953 by the 4th Earl, but the 6th Earl still owns the 4,200 acre park.

<text>Alamgir Hashmi (Urdu: عالمگیر ہاشمی), also known as Aurangzeb Alamgir Hashmi (born 15 November 1951), is an English language poet and writer of Pakistani origin.

Considered avant-garde, his early and later works were published to considerable critical acclaim. He is widely published in the United Kingdom, Australia, India, Canada, New Zealand and the United States.

He has produced many books of seminal literary and critical importance as well as series of lectures and essays (such as &quot;Modern Letters&quot;) in the general press.

<text>Earl Cawdor, of Castlemartin in the County of Pembroke, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1827 for the politician John Campbell, 2nd Baron Cawdor.

This Welsh branch of Clan Campbell of Cawdor descends from Sir John Campbell (died 1546), third son of Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll (whose eldest son Colin was the ancestor of the Dukes of Argyll; see the latter title for earlier history of the family). His descendant Pryse Campbell (d. 1768) represented Nairnshire in the House of Commons. His son John Campbell was Member of Parliament for Nairnshire and Cardigan. In 1796 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Cawdor, of Castlemartin in the County of Pembroke.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He represented Carmarthenshire in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Carmarthenshire. In 1827 he was created Viscount Emlyn, of Emlyn in the County of Carmarthen, and Earl Cawdor, of Castlemartin in the County of Pembroke. These titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His son, the second Earl, was Member of Parliament for Pembrokeshire and Lord Lieutenant of Carmarthenshire. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl. He was a Conservative politician and served briefly as First Lord of the Admiralty in 1905. Lord Cawdor was also Lord Lieutenant of Pembrokeshire and Chairman of the Great Western Railway.

The titles are held by the seventh Earl, who succeeded his father in 1993. He is also the 25th Thane of Cawdor.

Several other members of this branch of the Campbell family may be mentioned. Sir George Campbell, younger brother of the first Baron, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. The Hon. George Pryse Campbell, second son of the first Baron, was a rear-admiral in the Royal Navy. Brigadier-General John Vaughan Campbell, who was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1916, was the second son of Captain the Hon. Ronald George Elidor Campbell, second son of the second Earl. Colonel the Hon. Ian Malcoln Campbell, third son of the third Earl, was Lord Lieutenant of Nairnshire. Liza Campbell is the second daughter of the sixth Earl.

The family seat is Cawdor Castle near Cawdor, Nairnshire, associated also with the ancient title Thane of Cawdor. Other family seats in the past included Golden Grove in Carmarthenshire, Wales, which was bequeathed to John Campbell, 1st Earl Cawdor by his friend, John Vaughan, after his death in 1804, and also Stackpole Court in Pembrokeshire, Wales, acquired by the marriage of Alexander Campbell to Elizabeth Lort.

*John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor (1753–1821)
*John Frederick Campbell, 2nd Baron Cawdor (1790–1860) (created Earl Cawdor in 1827)

<text>Earl of Durham is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1833 for the Whig politician and colonial official John Lambton, 1st Baron Durham. Known as &quot;Radical Jack&quot;, he played a leading role in the passing of the Reform Act 1832. As Governor General of British North America, he was the author of the famous &quot;Report on the Affairs of British North America&quot;, known in Canada as the &quot;Durham Report&quot;. He had already been created Baron Durham, of the City of Durham and of Lambton Castle in the County Palatine of Durham, in 1828. He was created Viscount Lambton at the same time that he was raised to the earldom. These titles are also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

He was succeeded by his only surviving son, the second Earl. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of County Durham from 1854 to 1879. On his death, the titles passed to his eldest twin son, the third Earl. He was Lord-Lieutenant of County Durham from 1884 to 1928 and was made a Knight of the Garter in 1909. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger twin brother, the fourth Earl. He represented South Durham and South East Durham in the House of Commons. His grandson, the sixth Earl, was a Conservative politician. He disclaimed his peerage titles shortly after succeeding his father in 1970, but improperly continued to style himself Viscount Lambton. As of 2014, the titles are held by his only son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 2006. Before succeeding to the earldom, he styled himself Lord Durham to avoid confusion with his father.

Several other members of the Lambton family have also gained distinction. Both the first Earl&#x27;s father, William Henry Lambton (1764–1797), and grandfather, Major-General John Lambton (1710–1794), as well as his great-uncle Henry Lambton (1697–1761), represented the City of Durham in Parliament. The Hon. Sir Hedworth Lambton (1856–1929) (who assumed the surname of Meux in lieu of Lambton), third son of the second Earl, was an Admiral of the Fleet. The Hon. Charles Lambton (1857–1949), fourth son of the second Earl, was a Brigadier-General in the Army. The Hon. George Lambton (1860–1945), fifth son of the second Earl, was a thoroughbred racehorse trainer who trained two Epsom Derby winners. The Hon. Sir William Lambton (1863–1936), sixth son of the second Earl, was a Major-General in the Army.

The ancestral seats of the Lambton family are Lambton Castle, near Chester-le-Street, County Durham, and Fenton Estate, near Wooler, Northumberland. The latter, about , was put up for sale in 2015 with a guide price of £10,000,000.

The first earl was the inventor of Dominion Status throughout the British Empire, leading to the creation of the Commonwealth of Nations. Canada&#x27;s official name was the Dominion of Canada, although it is now simply Canada. The Regional Municipality of Durham and Lambton County, both in the Canadian province of Ontario, are named after Lord Durham.

<doc id="469365" wikidata="Q1474108" url="?curid=469365" title="Fundamental domain">
<text>Given a topological space and a group acting on it, the images of a single point under the group action form an orbit of the action. A fundamental domain or fundamental region is a subset of the space which contains exactly one point from each of these orbits. It serves as a geometric realization for the abstract set of representatives of the orbits.

There are many ways to choose a fundamental domain. Typically, a fundamental domain is required to be a connected subset with some restrictions on its boundary, for example, smooth or polyhedral. The images of a chosen fundamental domain under the group action then tile the space. One general construction of fundamental domains uses Voronoi cells.

== Hints at a general definition ==

Given an action of a group &quot;G&quot; on a topological space &quot;X&quot; by homeomorphisms, a fundamental domain for this action is a set &quot;D&quot; of representatives for the orbits. It is usually required to be a reasonably nice set topologically, in one of several precisely defined ways. One typical condition is that &quot;D&quot; is &quot;almost&quot; an open set, in the sense that &quot;D&quot; is the symmetric difference of an open set in &quot;X&quot; with a set of measure zero, for a certain (quasi)invariant measure on &quot;X&quot;. A fundamental domain always contains a free regular set &quot;U&quot;, an open set moved around by &quot;G&quot; into disjoint copies, and nearly as good as &quot;D&quot; in representing the orbits. Frequently &quot;D&quot; is required to be a complete set of coset representatives with some repetitions, but the repeated part has measure zero. This is a typical situation in ergodic theory. If a fundamental domain is used to calculate an integral on &quot;X&quot;/&quot;G&quot;, sets of measure zero do not matter.

For example, when &quot;X&quot; is Euclidean space R&quot;n&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot;, and &quot;G&quot; is the lattice Z&quot;n&quot; acting on it by translations, the quotient &quot;X&quot;/&quot;G&quot; is the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional torus. A fundamental domain &quot;D&quot; here can be taken to be [0,1)&quot;n&quot;, which differs from the open set (0,1)&quot;n&quot; by a set of measure zero, or the closed unit cube [0,1]&quot;n&quot;, whose boundary consists of the points whose orbit has more than one representative in &quot;D&quot;.

== Examples ==

Examples in the three-dimensional Euclidean space R3.
*for &quot;n&quot;-fold rotation: an orbit is either a set of &quot;n&quot; points around the axis, or a single point on the axis; the fundamental domain is a sector
*for reflection in a plane: an orbit is either a set of 2 points, one on each side of the plane, or a single point in the plane; the fundamental domain is a half-space bounded by that plane
*for reflection in a point: an orbit is a set of 2 points, one on each side of the center, except for one orbit, consisting of the center only; the fundamental domain is a half-space bounded by any plane through the center
*for 180° rotation about a line: an orbit is either a set of 2 points opposite to each other with respect to the axis, or a single point on the axis; the fundamental domain is a half-space bounded by any plane through the line
*for discrete translational symmetry in one direction: the orbits are translates of a 1D lattice in the direction of the translation vector; the fundamental domain is an infinite slab
*for discrete translational symmetry in two directions: the orbits are translates of a 2D lattice in the plane through the translation vectors; the fundamental domain is an infinite bar with parallelogrammatic cross section
*for discrete translational symmetry in three directions: the orbits are translates of the lattice; the fundamental domain is a primitive cell which is e.g. a parallelepiped, or a Wigner-Seitz cell, also called Voronoi cell/diagram.

In the case of translational symmetry combined with other symmetries, the fundamental domain is part of the primitive cell. For example, for wallpaper groups the fundamental domain is a factor 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12 smaller than the primitive cell.

== Fundamental domain for the modular group ==
The diagram to the right shows part of the construction of the fundamental domain for the action of the modular group Γ on the upper half-plane &quot;H&quot;.

This famous diagram appears in all classical books on modular functions. (It was probably well known to C. F. Gauss, who dealt with fundamental domains in the guise of the reduction theory of quadratic forms.) Here, each triangular region (bounded by the blue lines) is a free regular set of the action of Γ on &quot;H&quot;. The boundaries (the blue lines) are not a part of the free regular sets. To construct a fundamental domain of &quot;H&quot;/Γ, one must also consider how to assign points on the boundary, being careful not to double-count such points. Thus, the free regular set in this example is

:formula_1

The fundamental domain is built by adding the boundary on the left plus half the arc on the bottom including the point in the middle:

:formula_2

The choice of which points of the boundary to include as a part of the fundamental domain is arbitrary, and varies from author to author.

The core difficulty of defining the fundamental domain lies not so much with the definition of the set &quot;per se&quot;, but rather with how to treat integrals over the fundamental domain, when integrating functions with poles and zeros on the boundary of the domain.

They are usually depicted as anthropomorphic cacti with &quot;haniwa&quot;-like faces in a running or dashing pose. One of the recurring elements of the series, it initially appeared as an enemy in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. By the 2010s, the Cactuar has attained widespread popularity with &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; fans, and is considered one of the established mascots of the long-running series alongside the Moogle and the Chocobo. While the Cactuar still appear as recurring enemies in modern titles, they are also depicted as summoned allies as well as friendly non-player characters.

== Development ==
According to Japanese video game artist, game designer and director at Square Enix Tetsuya Nomura, the concept of the Cactuar is based on a doodle he drew on a notebook when he was attending high school as a teenager. The design of the Cactuar&#x27;s face resemble &quot;haniwa&quot;, a type of terracotta clay figure traditionally used for ritual and funerary purposes during the Kofun period in Japanese history.

Alexander O. Smith, who played a major role in the English localizations of games developed and published by Square and later Square Enix like &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;, helped re-write translations written by a Japanese native translator for one of the PlayStation &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games in the 1990s. One of the notable errors he corrected prior to the game&#x27;s release was the original in-game description for the Cactuar, which was translated from Japanese to English as &quot;It ejaculates needles!&quot;.

For &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot;, the developer team noted that they had to make careful considerations on how to deal with the inclusion of comical or cute characters in a game designed to be more realistic than its predecessors. The Cactuar&#x27;s physical texture and the depiction of the inside of its mouth was emphasized by the designers to make it more realistic as a type of wildlife in the game&#x27;s world.

== Characteristics ==
Cactuars are typically depicted having stiff arms and legs without hands or feet, three black dots on their faces (representing two eyes and an oblong mouth) and three yellow quills at the top of their heads. The Cactuar&#x27;s silhouette resembles the Japanese 卍 symbol, pronounced as &quot;manji&quot;, which is traditionally a holy and auspicious symbol in Japan. Even in modern titles, they look and move in a puppet-like manner, balancing on one leg with the others bent at 90 degree angles. They are notoriously difficult to hit, and best known for their defensive attack, &quot;1000 Needles&quot; (also called &quot;Blow Fish&quot;), which typically does exactly 1000 hit points of damage to an opponent, regardless of defenses. In other games, they possess an even more powerful &quot;10,000 Needles&quot; attack. Many Cactuar variants have appeared in various games, such as the Gigantender, a large, bulky Cactuar that looks more like a typical cactus. The Cactuar is usually depicted in a head-on pose without their backside visible, but in &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; they have been noted as having a prominent rear end when photographed from the back.

In &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; there are three variants of the creature: the regular Cactuar, the Slactuar and the Gigantuar. The former two are regular enemies which are similar in appearance with a very low chance of spawning, and will attempt to run from the player characters when encountered. Gigantuar is found as part of an optional side quest in the game. All variants are difficult enemies in combat, but will yield a generous number of experience points and useful items when defeated.

== Appearances ==
In their first appearance in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, Cactuars (called &quot;Cactrots&quot; in American translation of the game) are found in a small desert west of the town of Maranda in the World of Ruin. Most attacks (physical or otherwise) completely miss it, even though it only has 4 hit points, making it difficult to kill without the use of special items. They have since appeared in nearly every game in the series, and are occasionally featured as summonable allies or friendly NPC&#x27;s. In &quot;World of Final Fantasy&quot;, the main characters can travel by train which is operated by a character known as the Cactuar Conductor; in one scene of the game which is framed as comic relief, the Cactuar Conductor eludes game protagonist Reynn while taunting her.

A mod which cosmetically alters NPC&#x27;s in &quot;Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition&quot; into Cactuars was created and promoted by Square Enix as an example feature of full mod support for the game&#x27;s PC version. Development manager Kenichi Shida indicated prior to the March 6, 2018 launch of &quot;Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition&quot; that the developmental team intended to introduce variants of the mod which enable players to customize the skins of in-game characters into other creatures such as Chocobos and Moogles at a later date, along with the public release of the game&#x27;s modding tool. A cosmetic skin for sword-type weapons called the &quot;Cactbar&quot; mod is also available for download along with the Cactuar suit mod.

Cactuars have also appeared in video game crossovers, such as &quot;Mario Hoops 3-on-3&quot;, &quot;Mario Sports Mix&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Quest X&quot;. As part of the &quot;Monster Hunter: World&quot; cross-over event with &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; in 2018, Cactuars which appear in the battlefield could be used as environmental traps, and players may encounter cactuar cuttings or flowering cactuar cuttings.

Matthew Adler from &quot;IGN&quot; noted that the Cactuar has appeared in 49 &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games and 16 non-&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles as of 2020.

== Promotion and merchandise ==
Like the Moogle and the Chocobo, the Cactuar has been subject to numerous licensed merchandise connected to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; theme, sometimes in collaboration with third parties such as Universal Studios Japan and Sony Interactive Entertainment for the 2017 video game &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Golf&quot;. Examples of merchandise which feature the Cactuar as its iconography include caps, hooded jackets, stuffed toy key chains, Christmas-themed cakes, wedding confectionary, and so on. A Cactuar was featured as an inflatable &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; mascot decorating an officially sponsored float for the 2019 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.

The Cactuar is included as an exclusive feature with special editions of the &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; as a summoned ally, available via downloadable content.

== Cultural impact ==
===Fandom===

The Cactuar has been subject to cosplay and fan art. In August 2014, a Chinese man performed a marriage proposal stunt wearing a Cactuar costume in Beijing, China.

===Critical reception===
The Cactuar has been well received, and often described as being an iconic element of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise. Jason Wilson of &quot;VentureBeat&quot; called the Cactuar his favorite video game monster, saying that, while &quot;kinda cute&quot;, they &quot;can be scary [...] especially when these cowardly creatures stick around instead of running away and launch its devastating &quot;1,000 Needles&quot; attack&quot;, also saying that they can easily cause a total party kill. James Stephanie Sterling called the Cactuar &quot;everybody&#x27;s favorite perennial mascot&quot; in a 2009 post published by &quot;Destructoid&quot;, and praised its design for &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; which was unchanged from previous iterations. Mike Fahey of &quot;Kotaku&quot; stated that the Cactuar is &quot;one of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;″s most iconic creatures&quot;, and commented that the &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; Gigatender was &quot;doing the best it can to live up to that legacy, bless its giant plant heart&quot;, also stating that they &quot;are adorable enough that I just want to sit in The Fields of Amber and watch them nearly topple all day long&quot;. &quot;GameFan&quot; called the Cactuar &quot;one of the most popular &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; enemies of all time, despite its inability to talk&quot;, saying &quot;his &quot;1000 Needles&quot; attack can be quite painful if your characters don&#x27;t have triple-digit hit points&quot;. In Darren Nakamura&#x27;s review of &quot;World of Final Fantasy&quot; for &quot;Destructoid&quot;, he found the Cactuar Conductor&#x27;s antics to be funny, as the context of the Cactuars being reputed as &quot;slippery jerks&quot; is well known to the series&#x27; fandom.

The Cactuar-themed mods for &quot;Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition&quot; has received a varied reaction. Joe Donnelly from &quot;PC Gamer&quot; was excited by the mod and found the Cactuar costume to be cute. In a post which highlighted examples of players amusing themselves with &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; modded content, Brian Ashcraft from &quot;Kotaku&quot; featured the Cactuar mod as an example of the game&#x27;s &quot;delightful strange&quot; mods. On the other hand, Alex Avard from &quot;GamesRadar&quot; felt that the Cactuar costumes are adorable but &quot;slightly creepy&quot;, whereas Zoe Delahunty-Light also from &quot;GamesRadar&quot; considered the Cactbar mod to be &quot;bizarre&quot;.

<doc id="469367" wikidata="Q5326356" url="?curid=469367" title="Earl of Plymouth">
<text>Earl of Plymouth is a title that has been created three times: twice in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==History==
The first creation was in 1675 for Charles FitzCharles, one of the dozens of illegitimate children of King Charles II and one of a few by his mistress Catherine Pegge. He died without heirs in 1680, and the title became extinct.

The second creation came in 1682 in favour of Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 7th Baron Windsor. The family descends from Sir Andrew Windsor, who fought at the Battle of the Spurs in 1513, where he was knighted. In 1529 he was summoned to Parliament as Baron Windsor, &quot;of Stanwell in the County of Buckingham&quot;. His grandson, Edward, the third Baron, fought at the Battle of St Quentin in 1557. Edward&#x27;s elder son Frederick, the fourth Baron, died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry. The latter&#x27;s son, Thomas, the sixth Baron, was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy. On Thomas&#x27;s death in 1641, the barony fell into abeyance between his sisters.

The abeyance was terminated in 1660 in favour of his nephew, Thomas Hickman. He was the son of Elizabeth Windsor, and her husband Dixie Hickman, and assumed the additional surname of Windsor as 7th Baron. He notably served as Governor of Jamaica and as Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. In 1682, he was created Earl of Plymouth in the Peerage of England, a higher title of nobility. He was succeeded by his grandson Other, who notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire, Denbigh and Flint. His grandson and namesake, Other, the fourth Earl, was Lord Lieutenant of Glamorganshire.

On the death of fourth Earl&#x27;s childless grandson, Other, the sixth Earl, in 1833, the barony and earldom separated. The barony fell into abeyance between his sisters Lady Maria Windsor, wife of Arthur Hill, 3rd Marquess of Downshire, and Lady Harriet Windsor, wife of Robert Clive, second son of Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis (see below for further history of the barony and Earl of Powis for earlier history of the Clive family). The sixth Earl was succeeded in the earldom by his uncle, Andrew, the seventh Earl. The seventh Earl died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry, the eighth Earl. The eighth Earl was childless and on his death in 1843 the earldom became extinct. The barony of Windsor remained in abeyance until 1855 when the abeyance was terminated in favour of Lady Harriet Windsor-(Clive), who became the thirteenth Baroness. The same year she re-assumed by Royal licence her maiden surname, as a first barrel of her name. Her eldest son Robert Windsor-Clive predeceased her and she was succeeded by her grandson, Robert, the fourteenth Baron, who was a prominent Conservative politician and held office as Paymaster General and First Commissioner of Works.

In 1905 the earldom of Plymouth was revived in the third creation when Robert was created Viscount Windsor, &quot;of St Fagans in the County of Glamorgan&quot;, and Earl of Plymouth, in the County of Devon. These titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first Earl was succeeded by his second and only surviving son, Ivor, the second Earl, who was also a Conservative politician and served as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms, Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Ivor&#x27;s eldest son, Other, the third Earl, succeeded in 1943 and died on 7 March 2018 when he was succeeded by his own son, Ivor, the present fourth Earl. As a male-line descendant of the first Earl of Powis in its present creation the Earl is a far heir-in-remainder to that peerage and its subsidiary titles.

Another member of the family was Thomas Windsor, younger son of Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 1st Earl of Plymouth, who was elevated to the new title Viscount Windsor in 1699. After the death of his son, the second Viscount, the title was extinct for 38 years from 1758. However his daughter and heiress, Charlotte Jane, married John Stuart, 4th Earl of Bute, and the title &quot;of&quot; Windsor was revived in 1796 (Earl of Windsor) as a (courtesy) style for the Marquess of Bute (the first subsidiary title is Earl of Dumfries since 1803 when this title, created in 1633, was inherited by the second Marquess).

The family seat was Hewell Grange, Worcestershire. Later residences are Oakly Park, Bromfield near Ludlow, Shropshire, and a house in London W8.

&#x27;Other&#x27; (pronounced ǒðer), a customary male forename for Earls of Plymouth, derives from medieval writings of earlier oral traditions regarding a Saxon ancestor &#x27;Otho&#x27; or &#x27;Othere&#x27; of the Hickman-Windsor family.

<doc id="469368" wikidata="Q7557978" url="?curid=469368" title="Solidarity (United States)">
<text>Solidarity is a revolutionary multi-tendency socialist organization in the United States, associated with the journal &quot;Against the Current&quot;. Solidarity is an organizational descendant of the International Socialists, a Third Camp Marxist organization which argued that the Soviet Union was not a &quot;degenerated workers&#x27; state&quot; (as orthodox Trotskyists argue) but rather &quot;bureaucratic collectivism,&quot; a new and especially repressive class society.

Solidarity describes itself as &quot;a democratic, revolutionary socialist, feminist, anti-racist organization.&quot; Its roots are in strains of the Trotskyist tradition but has departed from many aspects of traditional Leninism and Trotskyism. It is more loosely organized than most &quot;democratic centralist&quot; groups, and it does not see itself as the vanguard of the working class or the nucleus of a vanguard. It was formed in 1986 from a fusion of the International Socialists, Workers Power, and Socialist Unity. The former two groups had recently been reunited in a single organization, while the last was an expelled fragment of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). Solidarity&#x27;s name was originally in part an homage to Solidarność — a US-backed labor union in Communist Poland which, in Solidarity&#x27;s view, had challenged the Soviet Union from the left. As of its 2011 convention, Solidarity is a sympathizing organization of the official Fourth International.

==History==

From the beginning, Solidarity was an avowedly pluralist radical organization that included several currents of Trotskyism, socialist-feminists who had been in the New American Movement, and veterans of earlier New Left groups such as Students for a Democratic Society. Solidarity sought to &quot;regroup&quot; with others to create a larger revolutionary socialist-feminist organization. They hoped to initiate a broad regroupment that would include, for example, some of the fragments of the disintegrating New Communist Movement and many more socialist-feminists and New Left veterans. Discussions of regroupment and &quot;Left Refoundation&quot; have been initiated between Solidarity and other left groups of varying tendencies from the 1980s to the present, but these have not led to broader fusions.

Smaller-scale regroupments have occurred, however. During the 1990s, two organizations fused with Solidarity—the Fourth Internationalist Tendency (a group expelled from the SWP) and Activists for Independent Socialist Politics (a Socialist Action split that had previously worked in Committees of Correspondence). In 2002, members of the Trotskyist League joined Solidarity.

==Strategy==
Solidarity members often work in various unions for shop-floor militancy and rank-and-file democracy, and some have played key roles in maintaining and providing staff for Labor Notes magazine and Teamsters for a Democratic Union. Solidarity members have worked in many other mass movements in the US, including the anti-apartheid, reproductive rights, LGBTQ, Central American solidarity, Free Mumia Abu-Jamal, anti-war, and Global Justice movements, as well as the Green Party and the 1990s attempt at building a mass Labor Party. Solidarity members were deeply involved in Occupy Wall Street and Occupy in other cities since the Fall of 2011.

Solidarity prides itself on a &quot;non-sectarian&quot; approach to building these movements, and traditionally has prioritized the movements over building itself: &quot;Too often socialist groups have seen the development of a movement not for what it is and can become, but only what it might offer in the way of recruits. We reject this conception and affirm the need for an effective class movement in and for itself, which requires new forms of action, thinking and dialogue rather than repeating the known formulas&quot; (&quot;Regroupment &amp; Refoundation of a U.S. Left&quot;). Solidarity publishes a bi-monthly Marxist journal, &quot;Against the Current&quot;, which is produced by an editorial board including Solidarity members and independent socialists.

In the 2010 midterm elections, Dan La Botz, a member of Solidarity and a co-editor of New Politics, ran for the United States Senate under the banner of the Socialist Party of Ohio and received 26,454 votes, or 0.69% of the total vote.

== Presidential endorsements ==
In 2000, Solidarity endorsed both the Green Party&#x27;s Ralph Nader and the Socialist Party USA&#x27;s David McReynolds for President. In August 2004, Solidarity again endorsed the now independent candidacy of Ralph Nader. In 2008, the organization endorsed Cynthia McKinney of the Green Party for President. In 2012, Solidarity urged its members to vote for the nominees of either the Green Party, Peace and Freedom, or Socialist Party USA. For 2016, the organization again endorsed Jill Stein of the Green Party for President.

In the 2020 presidential election, Solidarity initially endorsed the campaign of Howie Hawkins in November 2019, who was running as the candidate for the Socialist Party and the Green Party. The organization later decided in August 2020, after a poll of its members, to take no official position regarding the presidential election.

<doc id="469373" wikidata="Q704540" url="?curid=469373" title="Arsenal VG-33">
<text>The Arsenal VG-33 was one of a series of fast French light fighter aircraft under development at the start of World War II, but which matured too late to see extensive service in the French Air Force during the Battle of France.

==Development==
The original specification that led to the VG series was offered in 1936 in order to quickly raise the number of modern aircraft in French service, by supplying a &quot;light fighter&quot; of wooden construction that could be built rapidly in large numbers. The contract resulted in three designs, the VG-30, the Caudron C.714 and the Bloch MB.700. Prototypes of all three were ordered.

Named for engineer Michel Vernisse (V) and designer Jean Galtier (G), the VG-30 was all wooden in construction, using plywood over stringers in a semi-monocoque construction. The layout was conventional, a low-wing monoplane that bore a striking resemblance to the later Italian Macchi C.202. Armament consisted of a 20 mm Hispano-Suiza HS.404 engine-mount &quot;moteur-canon&quot; firing through the propeller hub, and four 7.5 mm MAC 1934 M39 drum-fed machine guns, two in each wing. The design was supposed to be powered by the Potez 12Dc flat-12 air-cooled inline engine, but this ran into development problems. The prototype was then fitted with a Hispano-Suiza 12Xcrs instead, and flew in this form in October 1938.

In order to find some solution to the engine problem, the VG-31 was to use the 632 kW (860 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12Y-31 and the VG-32 the Allison V-1710C-15. The VG-31 flew in 1939 and proved to have excellent performance. The prototype VG-32 was completed in 1940 and awaiting its test flight when it was captured by the advancing German forces at Villacoublay.

The VG-33 was a modified version of the VG-31 using the same 12Y-31, and first flew on April 25, 1939. It had a surprisingly good performance of 560 km/h (348 mph), and was ordered into production with a contract for 220 aircraft in September, later raised to 1,000. Production did not take long to start, but most of the airframes never received engines and sat at the factory when it fell to the Germans.

Further developments continued while the VG-33 production started. The VG-34 mounted the newer 688 kW (935 hp) 12Y-45, the VG-36 used the 735 kW (1,000 hp) 12Y-51 originally intended for the VG-35, and introduced a new streamlined radiator bath that looked similar to the one on the P-51 Mustang. Single prototypes of all three were built and flown in early 1940. The VG-37 was an extended-range version of the -36, while the VG-38 was to have used the 12Y-77, but neither was built.

The last in the series was the VG-39, originally powered by the new 882 kW (1,200 hp) 12Y-89 using an extension shaft on the propeller to streamline the nose profile, giving the plane an excellent speed of 625 km/h (388 mph) even when loaded down with two more machine guns. The actual production version was to have been the VG-39bis, powered by the new 1177 kW (1,600 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12Z-17, using the streamlined radiator intake design from the VG-36.

Two more designs were projected, both based on the VG-39bis airframe. The VG-40 mounted the Rolls-Royce Merlin III and the VG-50 the newer Allison V-1710-39. Neither was built.

==Operational history==
The continual production problems that plagued the VG-33 meant that it never took part in combat. Only 19 aircraft, out of about 40 completed (and about 160 close to completion), had been received by the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; by the time of Armistice. Only two machines ever flew in an active unit – &quot;GC 1/55&quot; which commenced operations under chaotic conditions, four days before the armistice.

Although the VG-33 used an older, less powerful version of the Dewoitine D.520&#x27;s engine, the VG-33 prototypes could climb faster than the D.520, and their respective top speeds were comparable.

While it was under-armed in comparison to the Messerschmitt Bf 109, the VG-33 could have matched it in speed and maneuverability below 5,000 metres. As was also the case with the D.520, the limitations of the supercharger used meant that the VG-33 could not match the speed of the Bf 109 above 5,000 m.

The Germans captured four VG-33s, and one of them was tested by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; at Rechlin in late 1940.

==Variants==
* VG-30 – The original powerplant was the Potez 12Dc flat-12 air-cooled inline engine, but the prototype was fitted with a Hispano-Suiza 12Xcrs, and flew in this form in October 1938.
* VG-31 – prototype with reduced wing surface and radiator moved back.
* VG-32 – Allison V-1710C-15-powered prototype.
* VG-33 – First production model with Hispano-Suiza 12Y-31 engine (160 near completion at Fall of France. Unknown number completed.)
* VG-34 – 679 kW (910 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12Y-45 engine. 357 mph (575 km/h). Prototype only.
* VG-35 – VG-33 variant with 746 kW (1,000 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51 engine. One built.
* VG-36 – VG-35 variant with new radiator and new canopy. Prototype only.

<text>USS &quot;Chatham&quot; (CVE-32) (originally designated AVG-32, then later ACV-32) was built at the Seattle-Tacoma S/Y, Hull #27, Seattle, Washington, and fitted-out in Portland, Oregon. She was transferred to the United Kingdom 11 August 1943 under lend-lease and renamed HMS &quot;Slinger&quot; (D26). Designated as a transport carrier, the ship was mined, off Lowestoft, on 5 February 1944 but returned to service on 17 October, and worked-up a new crew.

In early-1945, she was sent to Sydney to join the Pacific Fleet as a replenishment vessel i.e. carrying spare planes for other carriers - attached to the 30th Aircraft Carrier Squadron. The Slinger was accorded the battle honour ‘Okinawa’, though her participation was indirect. Returning to Sydney, she ferried aircraft to/from Brisbane, before being ear-marked for the force that was to invade Japan; in the event, she stood-by at Manus, Philippines, as the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended the war.

In August 1945, she was sent to Hong Kong as a support vessel, and in the autumn made at least two trips to Sydney, returning civilians who had been interned. She returned to UK via Colombo, Cairo and Gibraltar in late-1945 into early-1946.

She was returned to United States custody on 27 February 1946, and was sold and converted by the Robin Line, and was re-launched on 21 November 1946 as &quot;Robin Mowbray&quot;. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., purchased Robin Line in 1958. She was scrapped in Kaohsiung Taiwan in 1969-1970.

==Design and description==

The were larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by one shaft, two boilers and a steam turbine giving , which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 dual purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

<doc id="469389" wikidata="Q808633" url="?curid=469389" title="Earl of Effingham">
<text>Earl of Effingham, in the County of Surrey, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, created in 1837 for Kenneth Howard, 11th Baron Howard of Effingham, named after the village of Effingham, Surrey, where heads of the family owned the manor.

This branch of the House of Howard stems from the naval commander and statesman Lord William Howard, senior son of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk from his second marriage to Agnes Tylney. William served as Lord High Admiral of England, as Lord Chamberlain of the Household and as Lord Privy Seal. In 1554 he was created Baron Howard of Effingham in the Peerage of England after leading the defence of London against Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion. His son and successor was better known to history as Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, after being granted that title in 1596. He was Lord High Admiral from 1585 to 1618 and served as commander-in-chief of the English fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588. In 1603 his eldest son and heir apparent William Howard (1577–1615), was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Howard of Effingham. He predeceased his father.

The titles of the Earl of Nottingham passed to a younger son, the second Earl. He represented Bletchingley, Surrey and Sussex in the House of Commons and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Surrey. He was childless and was succeeded by his half-brother, the third Earl. On his death in 1681 the earldom became extinct.

The barony descended to the most senior male heir, who was a first cousin twice removed, who became the fifth Lord Howard. He was the great-grandson of Sir William Howard (d. 1600), a younger son of the first Baron: this Lord Howard of Effingham served as Governor of Virginia from 1683 to 1692.

His eldest son, the sixth Baron, died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the seventh Baron, a prominent military commander. In 1731 he was made Earl of Effingham in the Peerage of Great Britain. His grandson, the third Earl, served under William Pitt the Younger as Master of the Mint from 1784 to 1789 and was Governor of Jamaica from 1789 to 1791. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. On his death in 1816 the earldom became extinct.

The barony descended to a third cousin, the eleventh Baron. He was the grandson of Lieutenant-General Thomas Howard, a son of George Howard, younger brother of the fifth Baron. Lord Howard of Effingham was a General in the Army. In 1837 the earldom of Effingham was revived when he was made Earl of Effingham, in the County of Surrey, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented Shaftesbury in Parliament as a Whig from 1841 to 1845. The titles descended from father to son until the death of his grandson, the fourth Earl, in 1927. He never married and was succeeded by a first cousin, the fifth Earl, the son of Captain the Hon. Frederick Charles Howard (1840–1893), second son of the second Earl. His eldest son, the sixth Earl, died childless in 1996. He was succeeded by his nephew David, the seventh Earl, who died in 2022, being succeeded by his son, the 8th earl (born 1971), the present holder of the titles.

Another member of this branch of the Howard family was Field Marshal Sir George Howard active in the mid-18th century. He was the son of the aforementioned Lieutenant-General Thomas Howard and the brother of Henry Howard, father of Kenneth Alexander Howard, 1st Earl of Effingham.

The family seat in the 21st century is Readings Farmhouse, near Blackmore End, Essex.

The Effingham Howards were curiously not included in a remainder on the restoration of the Dukedom of Norfolk in 1660 and therefore are not eligible to succeed to their ancestors&#x27; ancient honours.

<text>Rear Admiral Sir Christopher George Francis Maurice Cradock (2 July 1862 – 1 November 1914) was an English senior officer of the Royal Navy. He earned a reputation for great gallantry.

Appointed to the royal yacht, he was close to the British royal family. Prior to the First World War, his combat service during the Mahdist War and the Boxer Rebellion was all ashore. Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the North America and West Indies Station before the war, his mission was to protect Allied merchant shipping by hunting down German commerce raiders.

Late in 1914 he was tasked to search for and destroy the East Asia Squadron of the Imperial German Navy as it headed home around the tip of South America. Believing that he had no choice but to engage the squadron in accordance with his orders, despite his numerical and tactical inferiority, he was killed during the Battle of Coronel off the coast of Chile in November when the German ships sank his flagship.

== Early life and career ==
Cradock was born at Hartforth, Richmond, North Riding of Yorkshire, on 2 July 1862, the fourth son of Christopher and Georgina Cradock (née Duff). He joined the Royal Navy&#x27;s cadet training ship on 15 January 1875 and was appointed to the armoured corvette of the Mediterranean Station on 22 December 1876. Cradock was promoted to midshipman on 22 December 1877 and was present when the British occupied the island of Cyprus the following year. He was transferred to the ironclad on 25 July 1879 and then to the corvette on the China Station on 24 August 1880. Promoted to acting sub-lieutenant on 21 December 1881, Cradock returned to England on 6 March 1882 to prepare for his lieutenant&#x27;s exams which he passed a year later. His rank confirmed, he then passed gunnery and torpedo courses later in 1883.

Cradock was assigned to the ironclad in the Mediterranean after completing his courses and in 1884 was assigned to the naval brigade which had been formed for service during the Mahdist War. After serving in a support role during the war, he returned to his ship where he was promoted to lieutenant on 30 June 1885. Cradock was then appointed to the gunboat as her first lieutenant and remained there until he was placed on half-pay on 9 May 1889. He was briefly recalled to active duty aboard the new battleship to help during her shakedown cruise and to prepare her for the fleet review in Spithead in August. Cradock then spent a year on the corvette , assigned to the Training Squadron. During this time, he published his first book, &quot;Sporting Notes from the East&quot;, about the shooting of game.

On 6 September 1890, Cradock was appointed first lieutenant of the sloop-of-war which arrived in the Red Sea shortly afterwards. The Mahdist War had flared up again and the British formed the Eastern Sudan Field Force around the garrison at Suakin, on Sudan&#x27;s Red Sea coast. Cradock was assigned to the force in 1891 and participated in the capture of Tokar. He then became aide-de-camp to Colonel Charles Holled Smith, Governor-General of the Red Sea Littoral and Commandant, Suakin. For his service in this campaign, he was awarded the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Order of the Medjidie, 4th Class and the Khedive&#x27;s Star with the Tokar Clasp. After returning to &quot;Dolphin&quot;, Cradock helped to rescue the crew of the , which was wrecked on the coast of the Red Sea near Ras Zeith on 21 May 1893 during an around-the-world cadet cruise.

After a brief time on half-pay and another gunnery course, Cradock was appointed to the royal yacht on 31 August 1894 and published his second book, &quot;Wrinkles in Seamanship, or, Help to a Salt Horse&quot;. He served as a pallbearer at the funeral of Prince Henry of Battenberg on 5 February 1896. Promoted to commander on 31 August, he became the second-in-command of HMS &quot;Britannia&quot;. Before the beginning of the Second Boer War in October 1899, Cradock was briefly transferred to the drill ship to serve as a transport officer, supervising the loading of troops and supplies for South Africa, and was reduced to half-pay before the end of the year.

===Command and flag rank===
On 1 February 1900 he was appointed in command of the third-class cruiser , which was posted later that year to the China Station during the Boxer Rebellion. He commanded a mixture of British, German and Japanese sailors during the capture of the Taku forts on 17 June, led a contingent of British and Italian sailors into the Tientsin on 23 June, and then led the naval brigade that relieved Vice-Admiral Edward Seymour&#x27;s troops besieged in the Pei-yang Arsenal three days later. Cradock was promoted to captain effective 18 April 1901 and also received the Prussian Order of the Crown, 2nd Class with swords as a result of his actions. &quot;Alacrity&quot; arrived back in Britain in July 1901 and Cradock was placed on half-pay.

On 24 March 1902 he was posted to the protected cruiser on the Mediterranean Station, where from June that year he served as flag captain to Rear-Admiral Sir Baldwin Wake Walker, who commanded the fleet&#x27;s cruiser squadron. Cradock was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 26 June. He assumed command of the armoured cruiser on 20 December as Wake Walker shifted his flag to the ship, and &quot;Andromeda&quot; returned home. When King Edward VII visited Malta on 2 June 1903, he appointed Cradock a Member of the Royal Victorian Order. Off the coast of Sardinia, Cradock saved Prince Vudhijaya Chalermlabha, then serving as a midshipman in the Royal Navy, from drowning in April 1904. After the Dogger Bank Incident, Wake Walker commanded the cruisers, including &quot;Bacchante&quot;, shadowing the Russian Baltic Fleet as it steamed through the Mediterranean in October en route to the Far East. On 17 January 1905, Cradock assumed command of the armoured cruiser , but was invalided home on 17 June. He was on sick leave until September and was then placed on half-pay.

Cradock became captain of the battleship on 17 July 1906 and was relieved on 6 August 1908, publishing his last book, &quot;Whispers from the Fleet&quot;, in 1907. During this time the Royal Navy was riven by the feud between the reforming First Sea Lord, Admiral Jackie Fisher and the traditionalist Admiral Lord Charles Beresford and their followers. While Cradock&#x27;s position on the issues dividing the navy are not positively known, a passage from &quot;Whispers from the Fleet&quot; may offer a clue: &quot;... we require – and quickly too – some strong Imperial body of men who will straightway choke the irrepressible utterings of a certain class of individuals who, to their shame, are endeavouring to break down the complete loyalty and good comradeship that now exists in the service between the officers and the men; and who are also willing to commit the heinous crime of trifling with the sacred laws of naval discipline&quot;. After leaving command, he was again put on half-pay. He was appointed Naval Aide-de-Camp to Edward VII in February 1909 although he remained on half-pay. On 1 July Cradock was appointed in command of the Royal Naval Barracks, Portsmouth and promoted to Commodore second class while retaining his duties as aide-de-camp. Edward VII died on 6 May 1910 and Cradock stayed on until the end of October to assist his newly crowned son, King George V.

In the meantime he had been promoted to rear-admiral on 24 August 1910, and was relieved of his command in October. Still on half-pay Cradock reported to the Royal Hospital Haslar on 24 February 1911 with kidney troubles and discharged himself on 7 March to attend a staff course at the Royal Naval War College at Portsmouth that lasted until 23 June. He came in sixth out of seven students, and was noted as &quot;very attentive, but sick 1/3 of the term&quot;. On the 24th Cradock escorted visitors aboard a merchant ship to the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead. He became second-in-command of the Atlantic Fleet on 29 August, hoisting his flag aboard the predreadnought battleship . When the ocean liner ran aground during the night of 12/13 December near Cape Spartel, Morocco, smashing all of her lifeboats, Cradock was ordered to take &quot;London&quot; and the armoured cruiser to rescue the survivors in heavy seas. It took five days to get all of the passengers and crewmen off the ship, including Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife, his wife, the Princess Royal, and the king&#x27;s granddaughters. In recognition of his efforts, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on 28 February 1912 and later awarded the Sea Gallantry Medal.
In May Cradock shifted his flag to the predreadnought battleship where he took charge of experiments that the RN was conducting with launching aircraft from ships. Commander Charles Samson had already flown off from &quot;Hibernia&quot;″s sister ship while anchored earlier and she transferred her flying-off equipment to &quot;Hibernia&quot;, including a runway constructed over her forecastle above her forward 12-inch turret that stretched from her bridge to her bows. Samson took off from &quot;Hibernia&quot; in his Short Improved S.27 biplane while the ship steamed at in front of George V at the Royal Fleet Review in Weymouth Bay on 9 May, the first person to take off from a moving ship. Cradock hauled down his flag on 29 August and went on half-pay.

On 8 February 1913, he was given command of the 4th Cruiser Squadron, formerly the North America and West Indies Station (the main base remaining the Royal Naval Dockyard and the Admiralty House at the North Atlantic Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, and hoisted his flag in the armoured cruisers then . His orders from the Admiralty were to protect British lives and property during the ongoing Mexican Revolution, but to avoid any action that could be construed as British interference in internal Mexican affairs. The British Minister to Mexico, Sir Lionel Carden strongly disagreed with the official policy and argued for some sort of intervention. The situation was further confused by American suspicion of British actions, believing that the Monroe Doctrine meant that the Americans alone could intervene in Mexico.

Together with the American Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher, Cradock coordinated the evacuation of British and American citizens from Tampico, Mexico, when that city was threatened by rebels. He then transferred his flag to on 18 February 1914 and sailed to Galveston, Texas, where he arrived at the end of the month. There he visited some of the refugees and was feted by the Americans, including a visit with the Governor of Texas, Oscar Colquitt before returning to Mexican waters. Cradock was in Tampico, when the Mexican Army briefly arrested nine American sailors who were purchasing petrol in the city on 9 April. Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo, commander of the American forces off-shore, demanded an apology, but the Mexican government refused. The incident contributed to the American decision to occupy Veracruz on 21 April. Cradock was able to evacuate some 1,500 refugees from Tampico, Mexico City and Veracruz without incident.

===First World War===

When the preliminary warning of war with Germany reached Cradock on 27 July, there were two German light cruisers in his area. The brand-new had just arrived to replace . Cradock dispersed his cruisers to find and track the German ships, but the Admiralty was concerned about the presence of numerous ocean liners in New York that could be converted into armed merchant cruisers, so they ordered him to concentrate three of his cruisers off New York harbour. He sent two of his ships northwards and followed them in &quot;Suffolk&quot; before the declaration of war on 4 August.

On the morning of 6 August, &quot;Suffolk&quot; spotted &quot;Karlsruhe&quot; in the process of transferring guns and equipment to the liner about north of Watling Island. The two German ships quickly departed in different directions. &quot;Suffolk&quot; followed &quot;Karlsruhe&quot;, and Craddock ordered the light cruiser to intercept her. &quot;Karlsruhe&quot;″s faster speed allowed her to quickly outpace &quot;Suffolk&quot;, but &quot;Bristol&quot; caught her that evening and fruitlessly fired at her before the German ship disengaged in the darkness. Craddock had anticipated her manoeuvres and continued eastwards, but &quot;Karlsruhe&quot; was almost out of coal and had slowed down to her most economical speed and passed behind &quot;Suffolk&quot; the following morning without being spotted before putting into Puerto Rico with only of coal remaining.

Cradock continued northward in obedience to his orders and, after rendezvousing with the newly arrived armoured cruiser in Halifax, transferred his flag to her because she was faster than &quot;Suffolk&quot;. &quot;Dresden&quot; was ordered to rendezvous with the East Asia Squadron under Vice-Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee in the Pacific. &quot;Karlsruhe&quot; was sent to intercept Allied merchantmen off the north-eastern coast of Brazil. So the reported losses of shipping showed both ships moving south. In response, the Admiralty ordered Cradock southward on 22 August, put him in command of the South American Station the following month, and reinforcing his fleet with the elderly and slow pre-dreadnought battleship . &quot;Good Hope&quot; was coaled at the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda (by Bermuda Militia Artillery gunners assisting with coaling).

On 14 September, Cradock received new orders from the Admiralty. They apprised him that the East Asia Squadron was probably heading for either the west coast of South America or the Strait of Magellan. He was to detach sufficient force to deal with &quot;Dresden&quot; and &quot;Karlsruhe&quot; while concentrating his remaining ships to meet the Germans, using Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands to re-coal. To achieve this aim, he was to be reinforced by the modern armoured cruiser arriving from the Mediterranean. Until she arrived, Cradock was to keep &quot;Canopus&quot; and one with his flagship, &quot;Good Hope&quot;. Once he had superior force, he was to search for and destroy the German cruisers and break up German trade on the west coast, while remaining prepared to fall back and cover the River Plate area.

The day that the Admiralty issued this order, the East Asia Squadron appeared at occupied German Samoa. Noting this apparent movement to the west, and the continuing depredations of the light cruiser in the Bay of Bengal, the Admiralty concluded that von Spee meant to rendezvous with &quot;Emden&quot; in the southwestern Pacific, and cancelled the transfer of &quot;Defence&quot; to Cradock&#x27;s command. Two days later, the Admiralty messaged Cradock that von Spee was moving away from South America, and that he should search the southwestern coast of South America for German ships without worrying about keeping his ships concentrated. But they failed to inform him that &quot;Defence&quot; would not now be sent to him.

By late September, it had become clear that &quot;Dresden&quot; had passed into the Pacific Ocean. Cradock&#x27;s ships fruitlessly searched several different anchorages in the area of Tierra del Fuego, and returned to Port Stanley to re-coal on 3 October. Based on intercepted radio signals, the Admiralty decided that the East Asia Squadron was probably headed east, and so advised him two days later, although he did not receive the message until 7 October.

===The Hunt for the East Asia Squadron===
By late October Cradock had reliable intelligence that the East Asia Squadron had reached the western coast of South America. Cradock&#x27;s fleet was significantly weaker than Spee&#x27;s, mainly consisting of elderly vessels manned by largely inexperienced crews. However, the orders he received from the Admiralty were ambiguous; although they were meant to make him concentrate his ships on the old battleship &quot;Canopus&quot;, Cradock interpreted them as instructing him to seek and engage the enemy forces. Clarifying instructions from the Admiralty were not issued until 3 November, by which time the battle had already been fought.

====Battle of Coronel====

Cradock found Spee&#x27;s force off Chile in the late afternoon of 1 November, and decided to engage, starting the Battle of Coronel. Useless for anything other than searching, he sent the armed merchant cruiser &quot;Otranto&quot; away. He tried to close the range immediately to engage with his shorter-ranged six-inch guns and so that the enemy would have the setting sun in their eyes, but von Spee kept the range open until dusk, when the British cruisers were silhouetted in the afterglow, while his ships were hidden by darkness. Heavily disadvantaged because the high seas had rendered the main-deck six-inch guns on &quot;Good Hope&quot; and unusable, and with partially trained crews, Cradock&#x27;s two armoured cruisers were destroyed with the loss of all 1,660 lives, including his own; the light cruiser managed to escape. This battle was the first defeat of the Royal Navy in a naval action in more than a hundred years.

Departing from Port Stanley he had left behind a letter to be forwarded to Admiral Hedworth Meux in the event of his death. In this he commented that he did not intend to suffer the fate of Rear-Admiral Ernest Troubridge, who had been court-martialled in August for failing to engage the enemy despite the odds being severely against him, during the pursuit of the German warships &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot;. The Governor of the Falklands and the Governor&#x27;s aide both reported that Cradock had not expected to survive.

A monument to Cradock, sculpted by F. W. Pomeroy, was placed in York Minster on 16 June 1916. It is on the east side of the north transept towards the Chapter House entrance. There is another monument to Cradock in Catherington churchyard, Hampshire. There is a monument and a stained glass window in Cradock&#x27;s memory in his parish church at Gilling West. Having no known grave, he is commemorated by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission on Portsmouth Naval Memorial. In Portsmouth, VA, USA a neighborhood was named for Adm. Cradock in 1917. Also named for Adm. Cradock was a high school in the Cradock neighborhood from 1917 until 1992. The neighborhood still exists and is still called Cradock. There is still a Cradock Middle School. The neighborhood and schools were named in honor of Adm. Cradock for his assistance to U.S. Naval forces during the Mexican Revolution.

== Personal life ==
Cradock never married, but kept a dog which accompanied him at sea. He commented that he would choose to die either during an accident while hunting (his favourite pastime), or during action at sea.

<doc id="469397" wikidata="Q972250" url="?curid=469397" title="Central sulcus">
<text>In neuroanatomy, the central sulcus (also central fissure, fissure of Rolando, or Rolandic fissure, after Luigi Rolando) is a sulcus, or groove, in the cerebral cortex in the brains of vertebrates. It is sometimes confused with the longitudinal fissure.

The central sulcus is a prominent landmark of the brain, separating the parietal lobe from the frontal lobe and the primary motor cortex from the primary somatosensory cortex.

== Evolution of the central sulcus ==
The evolution of the central sulcus is theorized to have occurred in mammals when the complete dissociation of the original somatosensory cortex from its mirror duplicate developed in placental mammals such as primates, though the development did not stop there as time progressed the distinction between the two cortices grew.

=== Evolution in primates ===
The central sulcus is more prominent in apes as a result of fine-tuning of the motor system in apes. Hominins (bipedal apes) continued this trend through increased use of their hands due to the advent of bipedalism. This allowed for their hands to be freed up from their use in locomotion to focus on more complex manipulative actions such as grasping, tool use, tool making, and many others. 

Previous studies have also shown that the location where the split in the central sulcus occurs is at the division point between the wrist and the individual digits in primary motor cortex, further implicating the relation between the development of this region through the use of their digits. The KNOB is also a suggested cortical substrate of the hand, as there have been anatomical asymmetries which have been linked to hand preference and skill, further suggesting the development of hands in the formation of the central sulcus seeing as the KNOB is the central portion of the central sulcus folded over the buried gyrus.  

== Development in humans ==
The central sulcus begins developing around 13 weeks of gestational age and undergoes the fastest period of growth between 13 and 15 weeks of gestational age. However, the most active period of development is at approximately 18 to 19 weeks of gestational age. This is determined by when there is the greatest amount of migration of neurons and fibers occurring. It begins as a point or groove in the parasagittal region of the brain. It then becomes a distinct invagination that lengthens towards the lateral sulcus and towards the longitudinal fissure at approximately 22 to 23 weeks of gestational age.

Between 2 and 3 years of age, the landmark ‘Pli de Passage Frontoparietal Moyen’ (PPFM), which is a depression buried at the central part of the central sulcus, begins to appear. At 3 years of age, the average depth curve of the central sulcus is similar to that of adults.

=== Influences on development ===
The development of the shape of the central sulcus is influenced by both genetic and non-genetic factors. The deep structure of the central sulcus has been found to be more consistent in different brains than its superficial structure, suggesting that the superficial structure is more susceptible to non-genetic factors.

The shape of the central sulcus has been found to be different between people of different biological sex. Those of male biological sex have been found to have a less convoluted (small fractal dimension) right anterior wall of the central sulcus. In addition, while the width of the central sulcus varies, the central sulcus of males has shown to have a larger average width than the central sulcus of females. However, this is specific to the right hemisphere since the central sulcus of the left hemisphere has not shown significant results regarding gender differences. With regard to gender differences between hemispheres, females have been shown to have a larger average width of the central sulcus on the left side compared to that of the central sulcus on the right side.

Age also affects the shape of the central sulcus. In adults, the distance between the anterior and posterior walls (sulcal span) increases, while the surface area of walls, the sulcal length of the posterior wall, and the convolution (fractal dimension) for the right posterior wall of the central sulcus decrease. The posterior walls of the central sulcus appear to be affected more with age. Differences between genders regarding the average width of the central sulcus as one ages has also been shown. The average width of the central sulcus in males tends to increase more rapidly over time than that of females.

The surface area of the central sulcus has proven to have an effect on the handedness of an individual. Studies have found that when the central sulcus is larger in the left hemisphere, the individual tends to me more right hand dominant. This is also true about the central sulcus for left handed individuals; there is a greater surface area of the central sulcus in the right hemisphere. While the surface area of the central sulcus is shown to affect the handedness of an individual, it is not understood what the shape of the central sulcus affects as it is not widely explored. There is a region of the central sulcus, called the “hand knob”, which is a notch in the area of the hand motor region. The position of this “knob” can be indicative as well of someone&#x27;s handedness.

As motor functions develop, it is expected that the shape of the central sulcus will change. This is due to the role of the central sulcus in separating the primary motor cortex and primary somatosensory cortex. For example, differences along the central sulcus have been reported in musicians, particularly with regard to an omega formation along the center portion of the central sulcus, commonly referred to as the &quot;hand knob&quot;. Among musicians who specialize in string instruments, this omega formation is specific to the right central sulcus. However, among pianists, this omega formation occurs on both sides but more prominently on the left side.

== Clinical significance ==

=== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ===
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been associated with sensorimotor deficits and the central sulcus divides both somatosensory and primary motor areas prompting  research into how the shape of the central sulcus and ADHD may alter brain development in these individuals. The cortical thickness and average and maximum depth of the central sulcus has been shown to be larger for ADHD individuals when compared to normal individuals. Additionally, changes in the middle sections of the central sulcus have been linked to children with ADHD.

=== Williams syndrome ===
The morphology of the central sulcus has been suggested to play a role in individuals with the genetic condition known as Williams syndrome. The foreshortening of the central sulcus has been found to be an abnormality associated with this syndrome. This can be seen with the abnormal dorsal end of the central sulcus in individuals with Williams syndrome. However, the abnormal dorsal end of the central sulcus has not been found to be linked to impaired general intelligence. The functional importance of this abnormal part of the central sulcus is still not fully understood though.

=== Severe cerebral small vessel disease ===
The shape of the central sulcus has been linked to the degree of disability in individuals who have a small subcortical ischemic stroke as a result of severe cerebral small vessel disease. However, the severity of the disability has been found to not be fully dependent upon the morphology of the central sulcus. It was found to possibly be due to the hand knobs’ vertical position and size.

<text>HMS &quot;Atheling&quot; (D51) was a Royal Navy Ruler-class escort carrier of the Second World War. She was a US built ship provided under lend lease and returned to the US at the end of hostilities.

==History==

She was built by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation (Tacoma, Washington) under Maritime Commission Contract. She was launched 7 September 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Richard P. Luker. The ship was commissioned on 12 July 1943 as USS &quot;Glacier&quot; AVG-33 under the command of Commander Ward C. Gilbert. Her designation was changed to CVE-33 on 15 July 1943. Final work was carried out at US Navy Yard Puget Sound in July and she was transferred to the Royal Navy on 31 July 1943 at Vancouver, British Columbia

Following formal transfer the ship was sent to the Royal Canadian Navy dockyard at Esquimalt for conversion for British use. Following the work she was commissioned as &quot;Atheling&quot; on 28 October. She sailed via the Panama Canal and New York arriving at the Clyde UK in January 1944 and underwent further modification there to operate fighter aircraft.

Atheling ferried RN squadrons to the Far East in April 1944: 822 NAS and 823 NAS with their Fairey Barracudas at Madras on 11 April and 1837 NAS and 1838 NAS (Vought Corsair II) disembarked at Ceylon on 13 April,
At Trincomalee &quot;Atheling&quot; took on 1383 NAS and 899 NAS aircraft and personnel; ten Corsair and ten Supermarine Seafires respectively.

From November 1944 into 1945, she was engaged on aircraft ferry duties for British and US fleets. After the war she was used as troopship before return to the US.

From October 1945 to April 1946, her commanding officer was Capt. John Inglis, who was to become director of Naval Intelligence in July 1954.

&quot;Atheling&quot; put into Norfolk, Virginia, 6 December 1946 for return to the United States. Her name was stricken from the Naval Register 7 February 1947 and she was sold to National Bulk Carriers as the merchant ship &quot;Roma&quot; 26 November 1947. She was scrapped in Italy in November 1967.

==Design and description==
These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided a steam turbine, two boilers connected to one shaft giving 9,350 brake horsepower (SHP), which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4 in/50, 5 in/38 or 5 in/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

==History==
The area of Kiyama is part of ancient Hizen Province. After the defeat of the combined Baekje and Yamato Japan forces, at the hands of the Silla and Tang China alliance at the Battle of Hakusukinoe in 663, the Yamato court feared an invasion from either or both Tang or Silla. In response, a huge network of fortifications was constructed, one of which was Kii Castle, intended to protect regional administration center of Dazaifu. During the Sengoku period, the Tsukushi clan, a member of the Shōni clan, ruled this area. In 1587, after Toyotomi Hideyoshi conquered Kyushu, this area became the territory of Kobayakawa Takakage. After that, the land became an enclave territory of the Sō clan of Tsushima-Fuchū Domain until the Meiji restoration. The village of Kiyama was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Kiyama gained town status on January 1, 1939.

Entering service in 1943, the ship took part in operations against the and the invasions of Normandy and southern France. Returned to the United States following the war, the carrier was sold for scrap in 1946.

They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided a steam turbine, two boilers connected to one shaft giving , which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 dual purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Grumman F6F Hellcat, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

== Construction and career ==

&quot;Pybus&quot;, originally designated AVG-34, was laid down on 23 June 1942 as MC Hull No. 245 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding, Washington. Reclassified as ACV-34 on 20 August 1942, the ship was launched on 7 October 1942 and commissioned into the United States Navy on 31 May 1943 at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Washington. &quot;Pybus&quot; was reclassified as CVE-34 on 15 July 1943 and assigned for transfer to the United Kingdom under the Lend-Lease agreement. From March to April 1945 she was attached to the 21st Aircraft Carrier Squadron.

&quot;Pybus&quot; reported for duty with the Pacific Fleet after shakedown, in a temporary status, before she decommissioned on 6 August 1943 at New York. She was accepted that day by the UK and placed in service as HMS &quot;Emperor&quot; with the pennant number D98. During her British service, she helped provide fighter cover for airstrikes on &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, served on anti-submarine detail during Operation Overlord, and helped support the invasion of Southern France (Operation Dragoon).

Following the war, &quot;Emperor&quot; was returned to the United States Navy on 12 February 1946, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 March 1946, and sold 14 May to Patapsco Scrap Co., Baltimore, Maryland for scrapping.

<text>The Mirabilis liber (&quot;Mirabilis liber qui prophetias revelationesque, necnon res mirandas, preteritas, presentes et futuras, aperte demonstrat...&quot;) is an anonymous and formerly very popular compilation of predictions by various Christian saints and diviners first printed in France in 1522 (though purportedly published in Rome in 1524, probably because it was the date of an important and long-anticipated planetary alignment) and reprinted several times thereafter. It is not to be confused with the almost contemporary &quot;Liber mirabilis&quot;. Its unwitting contributors include:

* Bishop Bemechobus (misprint for Pseudo-Methodius – Syrian, 7th century)
* The Tiburtine Sibyl (Syrian, 9th century)
* ‘St Augustine of Hippo’ (actually by the 10th-century monk Adso of Montier-en-Der)
* ‘St Severus’ (in fact a 15th-century composition)
* Johann Lichtenberger (an anthology of various named sources, first printed in 1488)
* A set of papal prophecies (14th century)
* Telesphorus of Cosenza (14th century)
* Another anthology including St Brigid of Sweden, St Hildegard of Bingen, the Cretan Sibyl, the Hermit Reynard, St Cyril and the celebrated Abbot Joachim of Fiore
* Joannes de Vatiguerro (16th century)
* Joachim of Fiore himself (12th century)
* ‘St Vincent’ (actually a 16th-century compilation based on St Thomas Aquinas and others) 
* St. Catald of Taranto (actually a 16th-century text)
* Jerome of Ferrara (Savonarola – late 15th century)
* Fra Bonaventura (16th century)
* Johannes de Rupescissa (Jean de la Roquetaillade – 15th century)
* St Bridget of Sweden (14th century)
plus, in French, an anonymous anthology including a collection of late 13th-century prophecies elsewhere attributed to ‘Merlin’.

As the above indicates, the book—whose only known complete translation (by Edouard Bricon) was published in French in 1831—had two parts, the first in Latin and the second, shorter, in French. It contained prophecies of fire, plague, famine, floods, earthquakes, droughts, comets, brutal occupations and bloody oppressions. The Church would collapse, the Pope be forced to flee Rome. Such predictions made it extremely popular at the time of the French Revolution, when crowds besieged the French Bibliothèque Nationale to see it. Indeed, many nineteenth-century catalogues suggested that it had predicted the Revolution itself. But above all the book predicted a supposedly imminent Arab invasion of Europe, the advent of the Antichrist and the subsequent End of the World.

The &quot;Mirabilis liber&quot; seems to have served as a major source for the prophecies of Nostradamus, and was placed on the Lisbon version of the Church&#x27;s Index of Forbidden Books in 1581.

Mine has a small temple to a Buddha that is apparently able to cure warts. Mine is technically in the prefecture of Saga, but the city of Kurume in Fukuoka prefecture is closer than the city of Saga and is used by far more people. The city is just across the river called &quot;Mamebashi&quot;.

<doc id="469415" wikidata="Q757858" url="?curid=469415" title="Peso da Régua">
<text>:&quot;Regua leads here. For American major general, see Eldon Regua&quot;
Peso da Régua (), commonly known as Régua, is a city and municipality in northern Portugal, in the district of Vila Real. The population in 2011 was 17,131 (of which approximately 10,000 are in the town of Régua), in an area of  km².

==History==
Historians have suggested that Peso da Régua was inhabited during the Roman, Suebi and Visigothic periods. There are competing theories over where the toponym &quot;Peso da Régua&quot; could have originated: &quot;Vila Reggula&quot;, the name of a Roman country estate; &quot;récua&quot;, a word for livestock, which may have crossed the Douro at this location; or &quot;reguengo&quot; a designation for lands that were owned by the crown. Peso da Régua could also have originated from the word &quot;regra&quot; (), alluding to the hereditary rights of descendants achieved through forals. This theory is based on the donation of lands by Counts Henrique and Hugo in 1093, which were transferred to Egas Moniz. It is possible that this &quot;rule&quot; gave origin to the word &quot;Régoa&quot;, and later Régua. In regards to the word, &quot;Peso&quot; (), there are two hypothesis on its origin: the location being where goods were weighted and taxed; or the place where animals were fed (), &quot;Penso&quot;

===Middle Ages===
Peso de Régua received its foral from King Sancho I, who conferred on the locality of Godim the municipal charter.

On 3 February 1837, Peso da Régua was elevated to the status of &quot;vila&quot; (), which included the annexed municipality of Godim, the civil parishes of Godim, Loureiro, Fontelas, Moura Morta and Sedielos.

Its important role as municipality only achieved its zenith in 1836, after the Marquess of Pombal designated the Douro wine region, as a quality brand for export. This was helped through the creation of &quot;Companhia Geral das Vinhas do Alto Douro&quot;, in 1756, which delimited the vineyards of the Douro Valley by granite markers () to regulate the vineyards and wines produced. After this point, through commercialization and centralization, Régoa began to become the centre of the region.

On 31 December 1859, due to the extinction of the municipality of Canelas, the parishes of Poiares, Covelinhas, Vilarinho de Freires and Galafura were added to the municipality.

===Republic===
On 11 December 1933, the parish of Vinhos was created from the de-annexed region of Sedielos, resulting in a municipality of eleven parishes threaded along the Douro.

Within the integration of Canelas, in 1976, the municipality grew to twelve.

Peso da Régua became a city on 14 August 1985.

In 1988, the &quot;Office Internacional de la Vigne et du Vin&quot; recognized the municipality as the &quot;Cidade Internacional da Vinha e do Vinho&quot; ().

==Geography==

==Climate==
Peso da Régua as a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot, dry summers and cool to mild, wet winters. The average annual temperature is during the day and at night.

Administratively, the municipality is divided into 8 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Fontelas
* Galafura e Covelinhas
* Loureiro
* Moura Morta e Vinhós
* Peso da Régua e Godim 
* Poiares e Canelas
* Sedielos
* Vilarinho dos Freires

==Economy==

It cannot be expressed how important Port Wine helped to catapult the fortunes of Peso da Régua:

<text>HMS &quot;Ameer&quot; (D01) was an American escort carrier, the USS &quot;Baffins&quot; (CVE-35), that was transferred to the Royal Navy in mid-1943. As a served in the Far East until the end of the war. &quot;Ameer&quot; was returned to the US Navy in 1946 and sold off to commercial service.

==Design and description==
These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by a steam turbine, two boilers connected to one shaft giving 9,350 brake horsepower (SHP), which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 dual purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

==Pre-service==
&quot;Baffins&quot; was launched 18 October 1942 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding, Tacoma, Washington; sponsored by Mrs. Laurence Bennett, wife of Commander Bennett; and commissioned 28 June 1943.

&quot;Baffins&quot; remained at Puget Sound Navy Yard until 18 July 1943. Her classification was changed to CVE-35 on 15 July 1943. On 18 July, she proceeded to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where she was decommissioned the following day and transferred to the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease.

Now HMS &quot;Ameer&quot;, she was refitted to Royal Navy requirements, including a lengthened flight deck, the installation of ASDIC (Sonar), the adaptation of fire-fighting and ventilation systems, and the alteration of bomb and torpedo storage to accommodate either American or British ordnance.

==Active service==
Once she arrived in Britain, she was allocated to the British Eastern Fleet, sailing as escort in May 1944 to convoy KMF-31 to the Mediterranean, while en route to Trincomalee, Ceylon. There, she joined her sister ships , , and .

In early 1945, &quot;Ameer&quot; joined Force 61 as cover for Operation Lightning, the amphibious assault by 3 Commando Brigade (two Royal Marine units and one Army unit) on Akyab, Burma. In the event, Japanese forces had evacuated the area 48 hours earlier, making a heavy bombardment unnecessary.

&quot;Ameer&quot;&#x27;s next operation was Operation Matador to capture Ramree Island, where her aircraft spotted fall of shot for , on 21 January 1945. The bombardment was to reduce Japanese artillery batteries in advance of landings by the 71st and 4th Brigades. A few days later, &quot;Ameer&quot; covered landings on nearby Cheduba Island by the Royal Marines (Operation Sankey) that were, once again, unopposed; indeed, the whole island was unoccupied.

On 22 February 1945, &quot;Ameer&quot; sailed from Trincomalee, in Force 62 with , the light cruiser , six destroyers and six frigates. The objective was Operation Stacey, the first of three photo-reconnaissance missions designed to cover the Hastings Harbor and Phuket Island areas of the Kra Isthmus. The reconnaissance was successful without Japanese interference on 26 to 28 February. The following day the task force was located and attacked. Grumman Hellcats fighters from &quot;Ameer&quot; and &quot;Empress&quot; repulsed the Japanese aircraft.

In June 1945, Force 63, including &quot;Ameer&quot; and her sister ships , and , left Trincomalee for Operation Balsam, the third and last series of photo-reconnaissance missions over Malaya. On 20 June, at the end of the scheduled operation, the task force pilots executed offensive sweeps. &quot;Ameer&#x27;s&quot; Hellcats joined those from 808 Naval Air Squadron and Supermarine Seafires from 809 Naval Air Squadron to attack Japanese air bases at Lhoksemawe, Medan and Bindjai, strafing installations and aircraft. Anti-aircraft fire shot down one Hellcat.

&quot;Ameer&#x27;s&quot; last two operations were supporting mine-sweeping off potential landing sites. The first, with escort carrier , light cruiser and destroyers , and , provided air cover and bombardment off the Nicobar Islands over 9 and 10 July. The second, Operation Livery, starting on 24 July, cleared the approaches to Phuket Island, off the Kra Isthmus; was part of the covering force. On 26 July, Task Force 63 came under bomber and kamikaze attack and the minesweeper was hit. Japan surrendered three weeks later.

==Squadrons==
As a fighter carrier, HMS &quot;Ameer&quot; could carry up to 24 aircraft. In her active service, she carried mostly American Grumman Hellcat II (at first called &quot;Gannet&quot;) fighters, although Grumman Wildcat V (initially called &quot;Martlets&quot;) were also carried, as were Supermarine Walrus I amphibians at the end of the war.

==Post-war==
HMS &quot;Ameer&quot; was returned to the United States Navy at Norfolk, Virginia on 17 January 1946 and subsequently sold into merchant service 17 September 1946 as &quot;Robin Kirk&quot;.

She was later scrapped in Taiwan in 1969.
