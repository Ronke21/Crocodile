<text>Angela &quot;Angie&quot; Martinez (born January 9, 1971) is a Puerto Rican-American radio personality, podcaster, singer, former rapper and actress. Dubbed &quot;The Voice of New York&quot;, Martinez is widely known for her 28-year run at New York City station Hot 97 (WQHT). She left the station in 2014 to join crosstown competitor Power 105.1 (WWPR).

As a rapper, Martinez received praise for her bars when she was featured on the remix for Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s &quot;Not Tonight&quot; (1996). She later released two albums, &quot;Up Close and Personal&quot; (2001) and &quot;Animal House&quot; (2002), before retiring in 2003 to pursue her radio and entrepreneurial careers. As of 2024, she also hosts her own podcast through her YouTube channel, &quot;IRL&quot; (short for &quot;In Real Life&quot;) in which she interviews various entertainment industry figures, of all ages.

== Early life ==
Martinez was born on January 9, 1971, in Brooklyn, a borough of New York City. Her father is Puerto Rican and her mother is of Puerto Rican, Cuban and Dominican descent. She was raised by her single mother in Brooklyn as well as Washington Heights. As a teenager, she would often drink with her friends, smoke marijuana, and listen to music. She was often absent from school. As such, her mother decided to move her to Miami to live with her aunt. Her mother later moved as well where she became the programming manager for radio station WPOW. Martinez later gained an internship at the station.

==Radio career==
Martinez got her first break in FM broadcasting in 1986, at the age of 15, answering hotlines at the urban radio station WQHT, known publicly as Hot 97. While there, she met popular DJ Funkmaster Flex, and began working as his protégé. Martinez quickly picked-up on the craft and skills of running a successful radio program. She hosted the &quot;Afternoon Drive&quot; segments, on weekdays, alongside fellow comrade DJ Enuff, where she interviewed some of the biggest names in music, such as Jay-Z, DMX, and Mariah Carey, among others. During her tenure, she also worked alongside Wendy Williams, with whom she reportedly clashed with. She resigned from Hot 97 on June 18, 2014, but confirmed that she was on good terms with former comrades Ebro Darden, Funkmaster Flex and Cipha Sounds. Subsequently, it was announced that she had signed on with Hot 97&#x27;s main New York radio competitor, Power 105.1 (WWPR-FM), on June 19, 2014.

In November 2014, Martinez was signed to a management deal with Jay-Z&#x27;s Roc Nation.

Martinez won the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Marconi Radio Award for &quot;Major Market Personality of the Year&quot; in 2018, and was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Music career==
In 1996, Martinez was encouraged to give rapping a shot by friend KRS-One. She appeared on his track, &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, from his 1997 album &quot;I Got Next&quot;. After the song gained a strong fan following, another friend, Lil&#x27; Kim, offered her a spot on the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot; remix of her song &quot;Not Tonight&quot;, for the soundtrack to the action buddy comedy-drama film, &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; (1997). Also featured on the remix were Missy Elliott, Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes (of TLC) and Da Brat; the quintet enjoyed one of the most successful singles of 1997. The &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot; remix peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart at No. 6, reached No. 3 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and No. 2 on the Hot Rap Songs charts, respectively. The CD-single sold over one million copies and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America that November. All five women were then featured in a live performance of the song at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards. The song was also nominated at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 1998 ceremony.

A major record label battle began, in an effort to sign Martinez to a recording contract; her collaborations with other artists&#x27; music was in high demand. She recorded songs with yet another close friend, singer Mary J. Blige (&quot;Christmas in the City&quot;), as well as Cuban Link (&quot;Freak Out&quot;), N.O.R.E. (&quot;Oh No&quot; remix), Beenie Man (&quot;Tell Me&quot; remix) and Funkmaster Flex &amp; Big Kap&#x27;s compilation album &quot;The Tunnel&quot; (&quot;Wow&quot;). She also recorded interludes for mixtapes by Kid Capri, DJ Clue and DJ Kayslay. In 2001, she appeared in the music video for Jay-Z and R. Kelly&#x27;s single &quot;Guilty Until Proven Innocent&quot;.

On April 17, 2001, she released her debut studio album, &quot;Up Close and Personal&quot;. The album included production by Salaam Remi, Knobody, Rockwilder and the Neptunes, as well as guest appearances by Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Wyclef Jean, Busta Rhymes, The Lox, Fat Joe, Prodigy and Kool G. Rap, among others. The first single, &quot;Dem Thangz&quot; was produced by the Neptunes, and featured background vocals by Neptunes member Pharrell Williams and former Tribe Called Quest rapper Q-Tip. The album debuted at No. 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, selling 69,000 in its first week. The second single, &quot;Coast 2 Coast (Suavamente)&quot;, featuring Haitian artist Wyclef Jean, re-sparked interest in the album. She promoted the album with magazine posters, in-store signings, club appearances and television appearances with MTV and BET.

Following her debut album&#x27;s release, Martinez began work on a second record, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Animal House&quot;. In order to build anticipation for the record, she appeared on BET&#x27;s &quot;Rap City&quot; and began a nationwide radio tour. She recorded a verse for the remix to her artist Sacario&#x27;s record &quot;Live Big&quot;. It became the No. 1 record in the tri-state area, and coincided with the release of the lead single off of her second album, &quot;If I Could Go&quot;, which coincidentally also featured Sacario, as well as singer Lil&#x27; Mo. &quot;If I Could Go&quot; became a huge crossover hit on pop radio, climbing into the Top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at No. 15. It became the most-played song on urban radio during the summer of 2002. Martinez&#x27;s sophomore studio album, &quot;Animal House&quot; (named after her production company and recording posse), was released on August 21, 2002. It entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 11, and the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart at No. 6, selling 92,000 units in its first week. The follow-up single, &quot;Take You Home&quot;, featuring R&amp;B singer Kelis, became a minor hit, reaching the bottom end of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Despite its moderate commercial performance, the album was more strongly received by critics and fans. Following the release of the album, she was featured on a remix for former Elektra Records labelmate Lil&#x27; Mo&#x27;s track, &quot;Gangsta&quot;, and Nina Sky&#x27;s single &quot;Time to Go&quot;. Following this, in 2003, she announced she was retiring from the music industry to concentrate on her passions as a radio personality and other ventures.

Martinez later appeared in the music video for Ja Rule&#x27;s single, &quot;New York&quot; (2004), a feature which was somewhat controversial due to the guest appearances of Fat Joe and Lox member Jadakiss in the midst of Ja Rule&#x27;s feud with rapper 50 Cent. In response, 50 Cent recorded the track &quot;Piggy Bank&quot;. Luckily, Martinez was not named or considered guilty-by-association on the track. She also appeared in an album intro with La La Anthony for singer-songwriter Babyface&#x27;s album, &quot;Girls Night Out&quot;, which was released in October 2022.

== Other ventures ==
Martinez provided voiceover of Hot 97 in the 2001 Xbox video game &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot;.

In 2002, Martinez was hired to be a judge on the second season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, but quit after a few days of auditions, citing discomfort with crushing the dreams of auditioners.

In 2008, she became the opening speaker for then-president of the United States, Barack Obama. In 2022, she attended a summit with former first lady, Michelle Obama, whom she later invited to appear on her radio show.

In June 2016, she released an autobiographical novel titled &quot;My Voice: A Memoir&quot;.

In May 2018, to further promote and support rapper J. Cole&#x27;s album, &quot;KOD&quot;, Martinez conducted an in-house interview with him in producer Salaam Remi&#x27;s house in Miami. It had received over four million views on YouTube, as of September 2023.

Then, in 2019, she hosted a We TV interview series called the &quot;Untold Stories of Hip-Hop&quot;, but in 2020, the show was cancelled.

On March 4, 2020, Martinez received a degree for honorary doctor of fine arts at Rutgers University–Newark.

In June 2023, in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of hip hop music, she hosted an ABC special titled &quot;Soul of a Nation: Hip Hop at 50&quot;; she is also the executive producer of the project.

===Acting===
As an actress, Martinez received a small role in the independent hip hop film, &quot;Blood Is Thicker Than Water&quot;. In 2002, Martinez appeared in a cameo on the Damon Dash-directed comedy, &quot;Paper Soldiers&quot;, which starred Kevin Hart. That October, she appeared in &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, starring Taye Diggs, Queen Latifah and Sanaa Lathan. Martinez was also noticed in an uncredited appearance as a drug dealer&#x27;s car girl in the film, &quot;Paid in Full&quot;. The film itself was based on the 1980s crack epidemic in New York City and its war on drugs, as well as the partnership between Azie Faison, Rich Porter and Alpo Martinez. In 2005, Martinez reunited with Dash for &quot;State Property 2&quot;, the sequel to the 2002 film, which starred rapper Beanie Sigel.

She also appeared in &quot;Video Girl&quot;, with actress Meagan Good in 2011 and &quot;Generation Um...&quot; in 2012, respectively. Martinez was one of the few Hot 97 personnel to appear on the VH1 reality docu-comedy television series, &quot;This Is Hot 97&quot;, which premiered in 2014, but was later cancelled after one season. The show was produced by Mona Scott-Young, co-founder of Violator Management, founder of Monami Productions and creator of &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop&quot;.

=== Podcasting ===
In 2022, it was announced that Martinez would launch a podcast on iHeartRadio, Apple Music and YouTube called IRL. It has been conductive in interviews with Lauren London, Kim Kardashian, Taraji P. Henson, Kelly Rowland, Mary J. Blige and Janelle Monáe, among others.

=== Charity work ===
In 2014, Martinez ran the 2014 New York City Marathon in support of CC Sabathia&#x27;s charity, the PitCCh In Foundation.

==Personal life==
She has a son, Niko Ruffin, born in a New York City hospital in June 2003. Her son&#x27;s biological father is Tamir Ruffin, better known as Nokio the N-Tity, the founder and bandleader of R&amp;B group Dru Hill.

Martinez&#x27;s close friend is singer Mary J. Blige, who coincidentally was born two days after her, and is also the godmother of Martinez&#x27;s son, Niko.

<text>The Third Republic of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a unitary state with a five-level hierarchy of types of administrative division. There are nine different types of country subdivision in a new hierarchy with no new types but with two from the previous one abolished.

Under the Third Republic, established in 2006, the number of provinces has gone from ten to twenty-five. By fits and starts the number of towns that have been, or are in the process of being, upgraded to cities has also increased greatly.

Reforms to devolve powers to the provinces were completed in 2006, but devolution to more local levels have again been delayed when elections scheduled for 2019 were not held. Traditional authority continues to play a significant role in governance with traditional leaders leading many of the subdivisions at the lower levels.

== Territorial organization ==
The Constitution divides the country into the capital city of Kinshasa and 25 provinces. It also gives the capital the status of a province. The hierarchy of types of administrative division in the province, as set down in other organic law, is as follows:


* Province
** Territory 
*** Sector or Chiefdom 
**** Grouping 
***** Village
*** Commune
**** Quarter 
**** Embedded Grouping 
***** Village
** City 
*** Commune
**** Quarter 
**** Embedded Grouping 
***** Village
So a province is divided into territories and cities; a territory into sectors, chiefdoms, and communes; a sector or chiefdom into groupings; and so on.

=== Remarks ===
* Kinshasa has the status of a province, but the subdivisions of a city. It is often referred to as a city-province and in many contexts is counted as the 26&#x27;th province.
* The district and the &quot;cité&quot;, previously a division of a province and territory respectively, have been abolished. The &quot;cité&quot; has been replaced by the commune.
* In the Congo a commune can now be an urban subdivision of a city, a country town, or in some cases a mostly rural area attached to a city.
* An older term, collectivity (fr. &quot;collectivité&quot;), is sometimes used for convenience to refer to both a sector and a chiefdom.
* Some collectivities are not a contiguous area of land but are made up instead of more than one unconnected area.
* The grouping (of villages) and, at a higher level, the chiefdom are subdivisions led by customary leaders of traditional polities.
* An embedded grouping is a grouping that has been absorbed into a commune.
* A quarter has divisions but these are not set down by organic law.
* There are uninhabited areas that are not part of any subdivision below a territory.

== New subdivisions ==

===New provinces ===
The Constitution, as before, divides the country into the city of Kinshasa and the provinces; however, it increased the number of provinces from ten to twenty-five. This was put into effect in 2015, when the six largest provinces were split into twenty-one new provinces. Together with the four unsplit provinces—Bas-Congo (renamed Kongo Central), Maniema, Nord-Kivu, and Sud-Kivu—they make up the twenty-five provinces listed in Article 2 of the Constitution.

Under the old organization the six former provinces were divided into districts and cities. The districts were further divided into territories. Each new province was created from the territories of one or two districts, adding any enclosed cities and—if necessary—making the new capital a city. The following table gives the complete details. So for instance, Lommami province resulted from the split of the former Kasaï-Oriental province; created from the territories of the former Kabinda district, the city of Mwene-Ditu, and by making the town of Kabinda the capital city.

=== New cities and communes ===
In June 2013 a batch of prime ministerial decrees was issued giving city and commune status to, and setting the boundaries for, a large number of former &quot;cités&quot; and other populated places. According to the government&#x27;s 2014 statistical yearbook the Congo would go from 21 cities and 227 &quot;cités&quot; in 2008 to 99 cities and 289 territorial communes in the reorganization. However, in July 2015 the implementation of many of the decrees&#x27; articles were suspended following the failure in the National Assembly of an electoral bill based on the boundaries in the decrees.

In order to pass a modified bill allocating seats for upcoming local elections, it was decided to suspend those articles that were contentious and to revert the affected communities to their 2006 administrative configurations. The articles granting city status to new provincial capitals—Boende, Bunia, Buta, Gemena, Inongo, Isiro, Kabinda, Kalemie, Kamina, Kenge, Lisala, and Lusambo—were not suspended and neither were those granting commune status to the administrative centers of the territories.

Ultimately the planned for local elections never occurred, but the suspensions were not lifted until mid-2018 just months before the general election. The National Alliance of Traditional Authorities of the Congo protested this reinstatement as diminishing traditional authority and as a threat to national security. In addition to reinstating the articles the government decided that disputes over boundaries would be resolved by an ad hoc committee and that the setting up of cities and communes would be prioritized with 18 cities in the initial phase. 

In 2019 mayors for the new cities of Uvira, Baraka, Kamituga, and Kasumbalesa were appointed. The setting up of a city administration and those of its subdivisions can take years given the lack of local resources. For instance the town of Buta gained city status when it became a provincial capital in 2015, had its first mayor appointed in 2018, and by June 2019 its four communes were still not operational.

== Number of subdivisions ==

Table 2 is based on data compiled by the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) as part of organizing the election cycle of 2018. The count of cities only includes those currently represented in the national and provincial assemblies and not those that became cities after the organization of the elections. Thus, for example, the new city of Uvira is not counted as a city but as a commune in the table. This of course also effects the counts of city subdivisions such as communes and quarters.

== Governance ==

The Constitution of 2006 and ensuing organic laws brought reforms to the governance of the subdivisions which are not yet complete. Table 3 sketches the envisioned governance by subdivision type and its current status.

=== Uncompleted devolution ===
These reforms devolved powers to the provinces and, more modestly, to the cities and the subdivisions at the third administrative level. They all were to have both an executive body with a leader and a deliberative body which was to elect the leader. The other subdivisions remained purely administrative in nature.

The Congolese voter would have a direct say in the affairs of the province by voting in a deputy to the provincial assembly which would then go on to elect the governor. The voter was also to have a say in more local affairs by voting in a councilperson to the local council which was then, except in a chiefdom, to go on to elect the local leader. If the voter lived in a provincial city they were also to have a more indirect say, again through the local council, in the composition of the city government.

Devolution to the provinces was launched with the which elected the provincial assemblies of the eleven provinces. Similar elections for local councils have yet to occur. Thus, the effected subdivisions have no deliberative body and their leaders, as provided by law, are unelected and appointed from above. In this way a city mayor is much like a territory administrator. For now the Congolese voter does not have a say in local affairs.

Local council elections were scheduled to occur on 22 September 2019. In April of that year the League of Women Voters for the Elections met with the electoral commission and condemned the delay in starting candidate registration for the local elections. In June, the League of Voters stressed the importance of these elections and asked President Tshisekedi to intervene to get the process going. In August, a petition with two million signatures demanding that the elections be held was filed at the presidential palace. The signatures were collected within two months by the Catholic and Protestant Churches. At the end of October the outgoing electoral commission presented their final report to the National Assembly. At this time their rapporteur said that organizing the local elections required a workforce of 650,000 and the allocation of considerable funds by the government. Finally, in December President Tshisekedi declared that the elections would be held sometime in 2020. This did not happen.

However, in February 2022 the new electoral commission published a roadmap for the next election cycle that would have the local council elections occur in December 2023 along with the elections for the president, the National Assembly, and the provincial assemblies. But, when the electoral calendar was published in November 2022, the elections for sector and chiefdom council were pushed back to 11 July 2024 leaving only the commune elections to be run on 20 December 2023.

===Traditional authority ===
Traditional leaders have a significant role in governing the subdivisions. At the first administrative level, 8% of all provincial deputies are co-opted traditional leaders. At the third and forth levels they are the leaders of 25% and 70% of the subdivisions respectively. In 2018, 64% of the electorate lived in a grouping without counting those in embedded groupings.

Traditional authority is recognized by Article 207 of the Constitution and a law defining the legal status of traditional leaders was passed in 2015. In addition to being official leaders of their administrative divisions, these leaders exercise customary authority – which can involve traditional advisory councils – in a way that is not contrary to the Constitution, the law, public order and decency. The leaders are also obligated to be apolitical.

Although selected by local structures according to custom, traditional leaders can only exercise their authority if they are officially recognized and invested by the government. Failure of the government to do so can cause great resentment. In 2013 such a dispute over the leadership of a grouping eventually led, through an escalation of conflicts in 2016, to the Kamwina Nsapu rebellion.

=== Electoral districts ===
Except for the four National Assembly districts in Kinshasa, all electoral districts in Table 4 are administrative divisions. The Carter Center expert mission report for the 2018 elections criticizes the use of these divisions for national and provincial elections as not meeting international standards for uniform allocation of voters per constituency. As example they contrast 27,228 voters per National Assembly seat in the city of Inongo vs. 128,699 in the territory of Lomela.

<text>The coat of arms of the [[Republic of the Congo]] has a shield with a rampant red lion holding a torch. The background color of the shield is gold with a green, wavy, horizontal stripe along the middle. A golden crown sits above the shield. Two large African war elephants support the shield. A banner with the national motto &quot;Unité, Travail, Progrès&quot; (; translated from &quot;La Congolaise&quot;) is draped from a bar supporting the war elephants. The arms were adopted in 1960 and readopted in 1991 after having been replaced with a simpler, unheraldic symbol during the People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo era from 1970 to 1991.

==Official description==
The coat of arms is described as follows:

*Or, a fess wavy vert, a lion gules, armed and langued vert, overall, maintaining a torch sable flamed gules.

<text>The Jordan River is a river in the U.S. state of Utah. Regulated by pumps at its headwaters at Utah Lake, it flows northward through the Salt Lake Valley and empties into the Great Salt Lake. Four of Utah&#x27;s six largest cities border the river: Salt Lake City, West Valley City, West Jordan, and Sandy. More than a million people live in the Jordan Subbasin, part of the Jordan River watershed that lies within Salt Lake and Utah counties. During the Pleistocene, the area was part of Lake Bonneville.

Members of the Desert Archaic Culture were the earliest known inhabitants of the region; an archaeological site found along the river dates back 3,000 years. Mormon pioneers led by Brigham Young were the first European American settlers, arriving in July 1847 and establishing farms and settlements along the river and its tributaries. The growing population, needing water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use in an arid climate, dug ditches and canals, built dams, and installed pumps to create a highly regulated river.

Although the Jordan was originally a cold-water fishery with 13 native species, including Bonneville cutthroat trout, it has become a warm-water fishery where the common carp is most abundant. It was heavily polluted for many years by raw sewage, agricultural runoff, and mining wastes. In the 1960s, sewage treatment removed many pollutants. In the 21st century, pollution is further limited by the Clean Water Act, and, in some cases, the Superfund program. Once the home of bighorn sheep and beaver, the contemporary river is frequented by raccoons, red foxes, and domestic pets. It is an important avian resource, as are the Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake, visited by more than 200 bird species.

Big Cottonwood, Little Cottonwood, Red Butte, Mill, Parley&#x27;s, and City creeks, as well as smaller streams like Willow Creek at Draper, Utah, flow through the sub-basin. The Jordan River Parkway along the river includes natural areas, botanical gardens, golf courses, and a bicycle and pedestrian trail, completed in 2017.

==Course==
The Jordan River is Utah Lake&#x27;s only outflow. It originates at the northern end of the lake between the cities of Lehi and Saratoga Springs. It then meanders north through the north end of Utah Valley for approximately until it passes through a gorge in the Traverse Mountains, known as the Jordan Narrows. The Utah National Guard base at Camp Williams lies on the western side of the river through much of the Jordan Narrows. The Turner Dam, located from the river&#x27;s mouth (or at river mile 41.8) and within the boundaries of the Jordan Narrows, is the first of two dams of the Jordan River. Turner Dam diverts the water to the right or easterly into the East Jordan Canal and to the left or westerly toward the Utah and Salt Lake Canal. Two pumping stations situated next to Turner Dam divert water to the west into the Provo Reservoir Canal, Utah Lake Distribution Canal, and Jacob-Welby Canal. The Provo Reservoir Canal runs north through Salt Lake County, Jacob-Welby runs south through Utah County. The Utah Lake Distribution Canal runs both north and south, eventually leading back into Utah Lake. Outside the narrows, the river reaches the second dam, known as Joint Dam, which is from the river&#x27;s mouth. Joint Dam diverts water to the east for the Jordan and Salt Lake City Canal and to the west for the South Jordan Canal.

The river then flows through the middle of the Salt Lake Valley, initially moving through the city of Bluffdale and then forming the border between the cities of Riverton and Draper. The river then enters the city of South Jordan where it merges with Midas Creek from the west. Upon leaving South Jordan, the river forms the border between the cities of West Jordan on the west and Sandy and Midvale on the east. From the west, Bingham Creek enters West Jordan. Dry Creek, an eastern tributary, combines with the main river in Sandy. The river then forms the border between the cities of Taylorsville and West Valley City on the west and Murray and South Salt Lake on the east. The river flows underneath Interstate 215 in Murray. Little and Big Cottonwood Creeks enter from the east in Murray, and from the mouth respectively. Mill Creek enters on the east in South Salt Lake, from the mouth. The river runs through the middle of Salt Lake City, where the river travels underneath Interstate 80 a mile west of downtown Salt Lake City and again underneath Interstate 215 in the northern portion of Salt Lake City. Interstate 15 parallels the river&#x27;s eastern flank throughout Salt Lake County. At from the mouth, the river enters the Surplus Canal channel. The Jordan River physically diverts from the Surplus Canal through four gates and heads north with the Surplus Canal heading northwest. Parley&#x27;s, Emigration, and Red Butte Creeks converge from the east through an underground pipe, from the mouth. City Creek also enters via an underground pipe, from the river&#x27;s mouth. The length of the river and the elevation of its mouth varies year to year depending on the fluctuations of the Great Salt Lake caused by weather conditions. The lake has an average elevation of which can deviate by . The Jordan River then continues for with Salt Lake County on the west and North Salt Lake and Davis County on the east until it empties into the Great Salt Lake.

===Discharge===
The United States Geological Survey maintains a stream gauge in Salt Lake City that shows annual runoff from the period 1980–2003 is just over per year or 100 percent of the total of water entering the Jordan River from all sources. The Surplus Canal carries almost 60 percent of the water into the Great Salt Lake, with various irrigation canals responsible for the rest. The amount of water entering the Jordan River from Utah Lake is just over per year. Inflow from the 11 largest streams feeding the Jordan River, sewage treatment plants, and groundwater each account for approximately 15 percent of water entering the river.

==Watershed==
The Jordan Subbasin, as defined by the United States Geological Survey, is located entirely within Salt Lake and Utah counties in a roughly rectangular area of . The Subbasin is part of the larger Jordan River Basin that includes the upper Jordan River, Utah Lake, Provo and Spanish Fork Subbasins. Four of the six largest cities in Utah are in Salt Lake County. The Jordan River flows through Sandy, with a 2010 population of 87,461; West Jordan, population 103,712; West Valley City, population 129,480; and Salt Lake City, population 186,440. Flanked on either side by mountain ranges, the topography of the land varies greatly. The Wasatch Range rises on the east, with a high point of above sea level at Twin Peaks, near the town of Alta. The Oquirrh Mountains rise on the west, with a high point of over above sea level at Farnsworth Peak. The low point of is at the river&#x27;s mouth, where the river enters the Great Salt Lake. Both the Oquirrh and Wasatch Mountains are fault-block mountains created from normal-slip faults where the mountains rise at the fault and the valley floor drops. The Wasatch Fault runs along the western edge of the Wasatch Mountains, and the Oquirrh Fault runs along the eastern edge of the Oquirrh Mountains.

From approximately 75,000 to 8,000 years ago, much of what is now northern Utah was covered by a Pleistocene lake called Lake Bonneville. At its greatest extent, Lake Bonneville reached an elevation of above sea level and had a surface area of . The lake left behind lacustrine sediments, which resulted in a relatively flat lake bed, and the valley floors have seen today. As the region experienced an increasingly warmer and drier climate over time, Lake Bonneville&#x27;s water levels receded, leaving the Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake as remnants. The river&#x27;s greatest slope, , is in the Jordan Narrows, while the rest of the river has a more gentle slope of .

Approximately (46 percent of land area) of the Jordan Subbasin is in the Wasatch, Oquirrh and Traverse mountains. The United States Forest Service manages of land in the Wasatch Range. The vast majority of the Oquirrh Range is privately held, with Kennecott Copper Mine owning most of the land. The State of Utah has scattered land holdings of throughout the subbasin and owns the beds of all navigable streams and lakes.

The Jordan Subbasin has two distinct climate zones. The lower elevations are characterized as a cold, semi-arid climate, with four distinct seasons. Both summer and winter are long, with hot, dry summers and cold, snowy winters. Salt Lake City receives of snow annually, part of a total of of precipitation per year. The mean maximum temperature is in July and in January Areas of higher elevation have two distinct seasons, summer and winter. One of the areas of highest elevation, Alta, Utah, receives of snow annually, part of a total of of precipitation per year. The mean maximum temperature is in July and in January.

==History==
The first known inhabitants of the banks of the Jordan River were members of the Desert Archaic Culture, a group of nomadic hunter-gatherers. A 3,000-year-old archaeological site, called the Soo&#x27;nkahni Village, was uncovered next to the Jordan River. The next recorded inhabitants, between 400 A.D. to around 1350 A.D., were the Fremont people, composed of several scattered bands of hunters and farmers living in what is now southern Idaho, western Nevada and most of Utah. The disappearance of the Fremont people has been attributed to both changing climatic conditions, which put an end to favorable weather for farming, and to the arrival of ancestors to the present-day Ute, Paiute, and Northwestern Shoshone. Although there were no permanent Native American settlements when European settlers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, the area bordered land occupied by several tribes, such as the Timpanogos band of the Utes in Utah Valley, the Goshutes on the western side of the Oquirrh Mountain Range and the Northwestern Shoshone north of the Salt Lake Valley.

In 1776, Franciscan missionary Silvestre Vélez de Escalante was trying to find a land route from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Monterey, California. His party included twelve Spanish colonials and two Utes from the Utah Valley Timpanogots band who acted as guides. On 23 September 1776, the party entered Utah Valley at the present-day city of Spanish Fork. The local Timanogots villagers hosted them and told them of the lake to the north. In his journal, Escalante described Utah Lake as a &quot;lake, which must be six leagues wide and fifteen leagues long, [and] extends as far as one of these valleys. It runs northwest through a narrow passage, and according to what they told us, it communicates with others much larger.&quot; The Great Salt Lake was described as the &quot;other lake with which this one communicates, according to what they told us, [and] covers many leagues, and its waters are noxious and extremely salty.&quot;

The next group of Europeans to see the Jordan River was the party of Étienne Provost, a French Canadian trapper. In October 1824, Provost&#x27;s party was lured into a Shoshone camp somewhere along the Jordan River, where they were attacked in retaliation for the murder of a local chief. In truth, the murder was committed by a member of Peter Skene Ogden&#x27;s party. The men were caught off guard, and fifteen perished, but Provost and two others escaped. The river was historically named Proveau&#x27;s Fork, as the Quebec-born fur trapper was known as Proveau and Provot, in addition to Provost (and the pronunciation was &quot;Provo&quot;).

On 22 July 1847, the first party of Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, and five days later another party led by Brigham Young crossed the Jordan River and bathed in the Great Salt Lake. The River Jordan (located in the Middle East) drains the Sea of Galilee into the Dead Sea in a way which the settlers found remarkably similar to the way the as-yet-unnamed local river drained Utah Lake into the saline Great Salt Lake. This similarity influenced the eventual name of the river, and on 22 August 1847, a conference was held and the name Western Jordan River was decided upon, although it was later shortened to the Jordan River. By 1850, settlements were established along the Jordan River, Big Cottonwood Creek, Little Cottonwood Creek, Mill Creek, Parley&#x27;s Creek and Emigration Creek. In 1850, Captain Howard Stansbury of the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers traveled the entire length of the Jordan River, surveying and making observations of the wildlife. In 1869 the river was used to float logs and ties utilized in the construction of the Utah Central Railroad.

Around the year 1887 at Bingham Canyon in the Oquirrh Mountains, low-grade copper deposits were discovered and mining claims were filed. Bingham Canyon is a porphyry copper deposit where magma containing copper, molybdenum, gold and other minerals slowly moved its way to the surface and cooled into rock. By 1890, underground copper mining had started, and in 1907, Kennecott Copper Mine started open pit mining. In the early 20th century, mills were established near the Jordan River in Midvale and West Jordan to process ore. As of 2010, Kennecott Copper Mine&#x27;s open pit is wide and deep.

Throughout the 19th century and up to the 1940s, water from the Jordan River watershed sustained the agrarian society of the Salt Lake Valley. In 1950, Salt Lake County had devoted to farming. By 1992, however, the rapid urbanization of the Salt Lake Valley had reduced the amount of land devoted to farming to , which was further reduced to by 2002.

===River modifications===
Alterations of the Jordan River watershed began two days after the Mormon Pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley when water was diverted from City Creek for irrigation. The earliest dam and ditch along the Jordan River was constructed in 1849 to irrigate land on the west side of the river near present-day Taylorsville. Other ditches include one built by Archibald Gardner, one of the founders of West Jordan in 1850, to provide water for his mill and one built by Alexander Beckstead, a founder of South Jordan, who built the Beckstead Ditch in 1859 to provide water for farmland. Many other small dams and ditches were also constructed in the first 25 years, several of which are still used as of 2010. All of these ditches irrigated only small amounts of land in the Jordan River floodplain; the largest, the Beckstead Ditch, irrigated .

By the late 1860s, it became apparent that new, larger canals needed to be built if more acreage was to be farmed. The first dam in the Jordan Narrows was constructed in 1872 and raised in 1880, sparking an outcry from residents living near Utah Lake who thought the dam was responsible for raising the level of the lake. After several years of dispute, a commission was established to determine an acceptable compromise for the elevation of Utah Lake. The commission&#x27;s 1885 decision stated that if the lake level were to rise above the established compromise level, the Jordan River could not be impeded by either dams or flood gates. Additionally, the commission stated that after water pumps were installed at the source of the river, the pumps should all be working if the lake were to rise above the compromise level. However, if the lake level fell below the compromise level, pumps could be turned off so that water could be held for storage in Utah Lake.
In 1875, the first large canal, the South Jordan Canal, was completed and it brought water to the area above the bluffs of the Jordan River for the first time. All told, five large canals that originated from the dams in the Jordan Narrows were completed by 1883. A second dam was built in 1890 a few miles (~5 km) downstream from the first dam and was constructed to better regulate the flow of two canals. Both dams have been rebuilt in subsequent years and operate as diversion points for canals rather than impounding water by the use of sluice gates and head gates. The drought of 1901–1902 caused the Jordan River, on occasion, to stop flowing, and in response to the drought a pumping plant was installed at the outlet from Utah Lake. It was the largest pumping plant in the United States at the time, and contained seven pumps with a total capacity of per second. Twice, during the droughts of 1934 and 1992, Utah Lake levels dropped so low that the pumps were rendered useless and the Jordan River actually ran dry. In the 1950s, due to flood control measures to increase river velocity, large sections of the river were straightened in Salt Lake County. As part of the straightening process, meanders or curves in the river were cut off and the channel slope was increased. The river was also shifted to opposite sides of the flood plain in Midvale and Murray as part of local smelter operations.

Floods in 1983–1984 caused Utah Lake to overflow its banks, flooding homes and farmland in Provo, Lehi and present-day Saratoga Springs. Dikes had to be constructed around Interstate 15 in Provo to prevent Utah Lake flooding the freeway. Big Cottonwood, Parley&#x27;s, Emigration and City creeks flowed down sand-bag lined streets in order to manage the overflowing streams. Additional dikes were built at the Great Salt Lake to protect railroad lines and Interstate 80. As a result of the flooding, the Utah Lake compromise level was amended to .

==Ecology==

===Invertebrates and fish===

In the Jordan River, invertebrates play an important role as a source of food for fish and other aquatic life, and they function as a parameter by which to measure water quality and the health of the river. There are 34 different groups of invertebrates found in the Jordan River, most commonly of the class Oligochaeta (which includes earthworms), mosquito larvae and caddisfly larvae. The state of Utah maintains a Sensitive Species List that includes &quot;those species for which there is credible scientific evidence to substantiate a threat to continued population viability.&quot; The Lyrate mountainsnail and the western pearlshell mussel, both native to the Jordan River watershed, are found on this list. A 2007 survey of invertebrates and their response to pollution stated that the Jordan River was substantially to severely impaired with organic pollution and that it contained reduced levels of dissolved oxygen.

Historically, the Jordan River was a cold-water fishery that contained 13 native species, including the Bonneville cutthroat trout, Utah Lake sculpin, June sucker, Mottled sculpin, Utah chub and the Utah sucker. Today, the Jordan River is a warm-water fishery with the Utah sucker and the endangered June sucker present only in Utah Lake. The Utah chub, however, is still found in the Jordan River. The most common species of fish encountered today is the common carp, which was introduced into the Jordan River and Utah Lake as a source of food after overfishing caused the depletion of native species stocks. The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources regularly stocks the river with catfish and rainbow trout.

===Wildlife===
Before the area was urbanized, mammals such as bighorn sheep, mule deer, coyote, wolves, beaver, muskrat and jackrabbits would have been seen along the river. A &quot;varmint hunt&quot; was organized by John D. Lee around 1848, after the arrival of Mormon settlers. The final count of the hunt included &quot;two bears, two wolverines, two wildcats, 783 wolves, 409 foxes, 31 minks, nine eagles, 530 magpies, hawks and owls, and 1,026 ravens.&quot; None of the original large mammals is found along the Jordan River today; they have, for the most part, been replaced by raccoons, red foxes and domestic pets. Animals from the Jordan River area found on the Utah Sensitive Species List include the smooth green snake, the western toad, kit fox, spotted bat, and Townsend&#x27;s big-eared bat.

Combined with Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake, the Jordan River offers one of the region&#x27;s richest bird resources. Over 200 bird species use the river for breeding habitat or as a stop-over on their migratory routes. Once-common native species such as the willow flycatcher, gray catbird, warbling vireo, American redstart, black tern, and yellow-billed cuckoo are no longer found along the river. The common yellowthroat and yellow-breasted chat are still found in small isolated populations. The most common species now found are the black-billed magpie, mourning dove, western meadowlark, barn swallow, and the non-native ring-necked pheasant and starlings.

===Vegetation===
Vegetation in the watershed is closely tied to elevation and precipitation levels. About 30 percent of the basin, mostly at higher elevation levels, is populated with oak, aspen and coniferous trees. At the lower levels, 27 percent of the basin is rich in mountain-brush, sagebrush, juniper and grasses. About 34 percent of the Jordan River basin is classified as urban.

Russian olive and tamarisk or salt cedar trees now dominate the Jordan River floodplain where willow trees and cottonwood trees would once have been found. Plant species such as foxtail barley, saltgrass, rabbitbrush, cattails and other reeds are still found in small pockets along the river. Exotic pasture grasses such as orchard grass, bluegrass, redtop bentgrass, quackgrass, wheatgrass and fescue have become the common species of grass. The vulnerable flower, Ute&#x27;s Ladies&#x27;-tresses, can also be found along the river.

==Pollution==
The Jordan River has been a repository for waste since the settling of the Salt Lake Valley. For 100 years, raw, untreated sewage was dumped into the river; farming and animal runoff occurred; and mining operations led to 40 smelters being built and contaminating the river with heavy metals, mostly arsenic and lead. In 1962, the river in Midvale recorded a total coliform level of about 3 million per 100 milliliters, even though the state of Utah criteria for the total number of coliform bacteria in water samples should not exceed 5,000 per 100 milliliters. In 1965, a new sewage treatment plant came on-line in Salt Lake City that prevented of raw sewage from being dumped into a canal.

The Utah Division of Water Quality and Utah Division of Drinking Water are responsible for the regulation and management of water quality in the State of Utah. Streams that exceed the standard contamination levels are placed on the 303d list in accordance with the Clean Water Act. The Act also requires states to identify impaired water bodies every two years and develop a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for pollutants that may cause impairments in the various water bodies. The Jordan River and Little Cottonwood Creek were included on the 2006 303d list; parameters that exceeded the standard level for at least part of the Jordan River include temperature, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, &quot;E. Coli&quot; and salinity.

===EPA Superfund sites===
Superfund sites are designated as being among the nation&#x27;s worst areas with respect to toxic and hazardous waste. The Environmental Protection Agency is the federal agency that determines if a particular site is hazardous, prepares a course of action to reduce the hazard, and finds the parties responsible for the pollution. If a site is listed with the Superfund program, federal dollars are available for cleanup.

The Kennecott South Zone/Bingham site contains contamination from Kennecott Copper Mine&#x27;s operation in Copperton, at the base of the Oquirrh Mountains to Bingham Creek and Butterfield Creek. A plume of lead, arsenic and sulfates (covering 9 percent of the watershed) currently contaminates the ground water from the mine site all the way to the Jordan River. The largest inland reverse osmosis plant in the country was built in 2006 to clean up the ground water and a second plant has been scheduled for construction; completion of the ground water cleanup, however, is not projected until 2040. In 1998, the site was removed from the Superfund list due to Kennecott&#x27;s progress in the cleanup and a consent decree legally obligating Kennecott to continue the rest of the cleanup.
The Murray Smelter site was the location of a large lead smelter in operation from 1872 until 1949. The site contained groundwater contamination from arsenic and lead, but the majority of the cleanup was completed in 2001.

In Midvale, there are two Superfund sites that sit along 4 percent of the Jordan River. The Midvale Slag site is a site adjacent to of the Jordan River. From 1871 to 1958, the site contained five separate smelters that processed ores from Kennecott and other mines. The site was contaminated with lead, arsenic, chromium, and cadmium. Cleanup of the property is complete, although the Jordan River Riparian Project still underway as of 2010. Sharon Steel was a site adjacent to of the Jordan River which was used, from 1902 to 1971, for smelting copper from Kennecott Copper Mine. The site was contaminated with lead, arsenic, iron, manganese, and zinc. Cleanup has been completed, and the site taken off the Superfund list in 2004.

===Uranium mill tailings===
Vitro Uranium Mill was a site located in South Salt Lake, surrounded by the Jordan River, Mill Creek, a small wetland and traversed by the South Vitro Ditch. The site, operational from 1953 to 1964, contained a uranium mill and storage for uranium. In 1989, surface contamination cleanup was completed with tailings, radioactively contaminated soil material, and debris removed from the site. However, of contaminated shallow ground water still remain, and studies are underway to determine what action should be taken.

==Jordan River Parkway==

The Jordan River Parkway was originally proposed in 1971 as a flood control measure with two reservoirs, restoration of wetlands, shoreline roads for cars, walking trails, and parks. By 1986, $18 million had been used to purchase lands around the Jordan River and to construct the Murray Golf Course, several smaller parks and about of canoe runs and trails. As of 2010, the majority of the continuous mixed-use trail has been finished from Utah Lake to the Davis County border. A water trail for canoeing and kayaking is also being constructed, but dams, bridges, weirs and other obstacles hamper the use of the river.

Riverside parks include the International Peace Gardens, of gardens with each garden representing a different country; Redwood Nature Area, about of natural areas; South Jordan&#x27;s Riverfront Park, of trails, fishing ponds and natural areas; Thanksgiving Point, including 15 themed gardens spread over 59 acres, and a , 18-hole golf course; and Utah County&#x27;s Willow Park, of camping and wildlife areas.

<text>The Jordan River is a stream in the northwestern part of the lower peninsula in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is the largest tributary of Lake Charlevoix. The Jordan&#x27;s headwaters rise from springs in the upper Jordan River Valley northeast of Mancelona in Antrim County. The Jordan River was the first river to be designated in Michigan&#x27;s Natural Rivers Program.

The Jordan River is well known for its world-class brook trout fishing and for its scenic canoe trips. The headwaters are accessible by many foot and ATV trails.

== Course ==
The Jordan River begins in central Warner Township in northeast Antrim County. It winds generally to the southwest, cutting across the northwest corner of Star Township before flowing west through northern Chestonia Township. It then turns to the north, flowing through Jordan Township, the northeast corner of Echo Township, then into South Arm Township in Charlevoix County and emptying into the south arm of Lake Charlevoix in East Jordan.

<text>Spectrophotometry is a branch of electromagnetic spectroscopy concerned with the quantitative measurement of the reflection or transmission properties of a material as a function of wavelength. Spectrophotometry uses photometers, known as spectrophotometers, that can measure the intensity of a light beam at different wavelengths. Although spectrophotometry is most commonly applied to ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiation, modern spectrophotometers can interrogate wide swaths of the electromagnetic spectrum, including x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, or microwave wavelengths.

==Overview==
Spectrophotometry is a tool that hinges on the quantitative analysis of molecules depending on how much light is absorbed by colored compounds. Important features of spectrophotometers are spectral bandwidth (the range of colors it can transmit through the test sample), the percentage of sample transmission, the logarithmic range of sample absorption, and sometimes a percentage of reflectance measurement.

A spectrophotometer is commonly used for the measurement of transmittance or reflectance of solutions, transparent or opaque solids, such as polished glass, or gases. Although many biochemicals are colored, as in, they absorb visible light and therefore can be measured by colorimetric procedures, even colorless biochemicals can often be converted to colored compounds suitable for chromogenic color-forming reactions to yield compounds suitable for colorimetric analysis. However, they can also be designed to measure the diffusivity on any of the listed light ranges that usually cover around 200–2500 nm using different controls and calibrations. Within these ranges of light, calibrations are needed on the machine using standards that vary in type depending on the wavelength of the &quot;photometric determination&quot;.

An example of an experiment in which spectrophotometry is used is the determination of the equilibrium constant of a solution. A certain chemical reaction within a solution may occur in a forward and reverse direction, where reactants form products and products break down into reactants. At some point, this chemical reaction will reach a point of balance called an equilibrium point. To determine the respective concentrations of reactants and products at this point, the light transmittance of the solution can be tested using spectrophotometry. The amount of light that passes through the solution is indicative of the concentration of certain chemicals that do not allow light to pass through.

The absorption of light is due to the interaction of light with the electronic and vibrational modes of molecules. Each type of molecule has an individual set of energy levels associated with the makeup of its chemical bonds and nuclei and thus will absorb light of specific wavelengths, or energies, resulting in unique spectral properties. This is based upon its specific and distinct makeup.

The use of spectrophotometers spans various scientific fields, such as physics, materials science, chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, and molecular biology. They are widely used in many industries including semiconductors, laser and optical manufacturing, printing and forensic examination, as well as in laboratories for the study of chemical substances. Spectrophotometry is often used in measurements of enzyme activities, determinations of protein concentrations, determinations of enzymatic kinetic constants, and measurements of ligand binding reactions. Ultimately, a spectrophotometer is able to determine, depending on the control or calibration, what substances are present in a target and exactly how much through calculations of observed wavelengths.

In astronomy, the term spectrophotometry refers to the measurement of the spectrum of a celestial object in which the flux scale of the spectrum is calibrated as a function of wavelength, usually by comparison with an observation of a spectrophotometric standard star, and corrected for the absorption of light by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

==History==
Invented by Arnold O. Beckman in 1940 , the spectrophotometer was created with the aid of his colleagues at his company National Technical Laboratories founded in 1935 which would become Beckman Instrument Company and ultimately Beckman Coulter. This would come as a solution to the previously created spectrophotometers which were unable to absorb the ultraviolet correctly. He would start with the invention of Model A where a glass prism was used to absorb the UV light. It would be found that this did not give satisfactory results, therefore in Model B, there was a shift from a glass to a quartz prism which allowed for better absorbance results. From there, Model C was born with an adjustment to the wavelength resolution which ended up having three units of it produced. The last and most popular model became Model D which is better recognized now as the DU spectrophotometer which contained the instrument case, hydrogen lamp with ultraviolet continuum, and a better monochromator. It was produced from 1941 to 1976 where the price for it in 1941 was US$723 (far-UV accessories were an option at additional cost). In the words of Nobel chemistry laureate Bruce Merrifield, it was &quot;probably the most important instrument ever developed towards the advancement of bioscience.&quot;

Once it became discontinued in 1976, Hewlett-Packard created the first commercially available diode-array spectrophotometer in 1979 known as the HP 8450A. Diode-array spectrophotometers differed from the original spectrophotometer created by Beckman because it was the first single-beam microprocessor-controlled spectrophotometer that scanned multiple wavelengths at a time in seconds. It irradiates the sample with polychromatic light which the sample absorbs depending on its properties. Then it is transmitted back by grating the photodiode array which detects the wavelength region of the spectrum. Since then, the creation and implementation of spectrophotometry devices has increased immensely and has become one of the most innovative instruments of our time.

==Design==

There are two major classes of devices: single-beam and double-beam. A double-beam spectrophotometer compares the light intensity between two light paths, one path containing a reference sample and the other the test sample. A single-beam spectrophotometer measures the relative light intensity of the beam before and after a test sample is inserted. Although comparison measurements from double-beam instruments are easier and more stable, single-beam instruments can have a larger dynamic range and are optically simpler and more compact. Additionally, some specialized instruments, such as spectrophotometers built onto microscopes or telescopes, are single-beam instruments due to practicality.

Historically, spectrophotometers use a monochromator containing a diffraction grating to produce the analytical spectrum. The grating can either be movable or fixed. If a single detector, such as a photomultiplier tube or photodiode is used, the grating can be scanned stepwise (scanning spectrophotometer) so that the detector can measure the light intensity at each wavelength (which will correspond to each &quot;step&quot;). Arrays of detectors (array spectrophotometer), such as charge-coupled devices (CCD) or photodiode arrays (PDA) can also be used. In such systems, the grating is fixed and the intensity of each wavelength of light is measured by a different detector in the array. Additionally, most modern mid-infrared spectrophotometers use a Fourier transform technique to acquire the spectral information. This technique is called Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

When making transmission measurements, the spectrophotometer quantitatively compares the fraction of light that passes through a reference solution and a test solution, then electronically compares the intensities of the two signals and computes the percentage of transmission of the sample compared to the reference standard. For reflectance measurements, the spectrophotometer quantitatively compares the fraction of light that reflects from the reference and test samples. Light from the source lamp is passed through a monochromator, which diffracts the light into a &quot;rainbow&quot; of wavelengths through a rotating prism and outputs narrow bandwidths of this diffracted spectrum through a mechanical slit on the output side of the monochromator. These bandwidths are transmitted through the test sample. Then the photon flux density (watts per meter squared usually) of the transmitted or reflected light is measured with a photodiode, CCD or other light sensor. The transmittance or reflectance value for each wavelength of the test sample is then compared with the transmission or reflectance values from the reference sample. Most instruments will apply a logarithmic function to the linear transmittance ratio to calculate the &#x27;absorbency&#x27; of the sample, a value which is proportional to the &#x27;concentration&#x27; of the chemical being measured.

In short, the sequence of events in a scanning spectrophotometer is as follows:
# The light source is shone into a monochromator, diffracted into a rainbow, and split into two beams. It is then scanned through the sample and the reference solutions.
# Fractions of the incident wavelengths are transmitted through, or reflected from, the sample and the reference.
# The resultant light strikes the photodetector device, which compares the relative intensity of the two beams.
# Electronic circuits convert the relative currents into linear transmission percentages or absorbance or concentration values.

In an array spectrophotometer, the sequence is as follows:

# The light source is shone into the sample and focused into a slit
# The transmitted light is refracted into a rainbow with the reflection grating
# The resulting light strikes the photodetector device which compares the intensity of the beam
# Electronic circuits convert the relative currents into linear transmission percentages and/or absorbance/concentration values

Many older spectrophotometers must be calibrated by a procedure known as &quot;zeroing&quot;, to balance the null current output of the two beams at the detector. The transmission of a reference substance is set as a baseline (datum) value, so the transmission of all other substances is recorded relative to the initial &quot;zeroed&quot; substance. The spectrophotometer then converts the transmission ratio into &#x27;absorbency&#x27;, the concentration of specific components of the test sample relative to the initial substance.

===Types of spectrophotometers===
Some common types of spectrophotometers include the following:
* UV-Vis spectrophotometer: Measures light absorption in UV and visible ranges (200-800 nm). Used for quantification of many inorganic and organic compounds.
* Infrared spectrophotometer: Measures infrared light absorption, allowing identification of chemical bonds and functional groups.
* Atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS): Uses absorption of light by vaporized analyte atoms to determine concentrations of metals and metalloids.
* Fluorescence spectrophotometer: Measures intensity of fluorescent light emitted from samples after excitation. Allows highly sensitive analysis of samples with native or induced fluorescence.
* Colorimeter: Simple spectrophotometers used to measure light absorption for colorimetric assays and tests.

===Applications in biochemistry===
Spectrophotometry is an important technique used in many biochemical experiments that involve DNA, RNA, and protein isolation, enzyme kinetics and biochemical analyses. Since samples in these applications are not readily available in large quantities, they are especially suited to be analyzed in this non-destructive technique. In addition, precious sample can be saved by utilizing a micro-volume platform where as little as 1uL of sample is required for complete analyses. 
A brief explanation of the procedure of spectrophotometry includes comparing the absorbency of a blank sample that does not contain a colored compound to a sample that contains a colored compound. This coloring can be accomplished by either a dye such as Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye measured at 595 nm or by an enzymatic reaction as seen between β-galactosidase and ONPG (turns sample yellow) measured at 420  nm. The spectrophotometer is used to measure colored compounds in the visible region of light (between 350 nm and 800 nm), thus it can be used to find more information about the substance being studied. 
In biochemical experiments, a chemical and/or physical property is chosen and the procedure that is used is specific to that property to derive more information about the sample, such as the quantity, purity, enzyme activity, etc. 
Spectrophotometry can be used for a number of techniques such as determining optimal wavelength absorbance of samples, determining optimal pH for absorbance of samples, determining concentrations of unknown samples, and determining the pKa of various samples. Spectrophotometry is also a helpful process for protein purification and can also be used as a method to create optical assays of a compound. Spectrophotometric data can also be used in conjunction with the Beer–Lambert Equation, formula_1, to determine various relationships between transmittance and concentration, and absorbance and concentration. Because a spectrophotometer measures the wavelength of a compound through its color, a dye-binding substance can be added so that it can undergo a color change and be measured. It is possible to know the concentrations of a two-component mixture using the absorption spectra of the standard solutions of each component. To do this, it is necessary to know the extinction coefficient of this mixture at two wavelengths and the extinction coefficients of solutions that contain the known weights of the two components. In addition to the traditional Beer-Lamberts law model, cuvette based label free spectroscopy can be used, which add an optical filter in the pathways of the light, enabling the spectrophotometer to quantify concentration, size and refractive index of samples following the hands law. Spectrophotometers have been developed and improved over decades and have been widely used among chemists. Additionally, Spectrophotometers are specialized to measure either UV or Visible light wavelength absorbance values. It is considered to be a highly accurate instrument that is also very sensitive and therefore extremely precise, especially in determining color change. This method is also convenient for use in laboratory experiments because it is an inexpensive and relatively simple process.

==UV-visible spectrophotometry==
Most spectrophotometers are used in the UV and visible regions of the spectrum, and some of these instruments also operate into the near-infrared region as well. The concentration of a protein can be estimated by measuring the OD at 280 nm due to the presence of tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine. This method is not very accurate since the composition of proteins varies greatly and proteins with none of these amino acids do not have maximum absorption at 280 nm. Nucleic acid contamination can also interfere. This method requires a spectrophotometer capable of measuring in the UV region with quartz cuvettes.

Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy involves energy levels that excite electronic transitions. Absorption of UV-vis light excites molecules that are in ground-states to their excited-states.

Visible region 400–700 nm spectrophotometry is used extensively in colorimetry science. It is a known fact that it operates best at the range of 0.2–0.8 O.D. Ink manufacturers, printing companies, textiles vendors, and many more, need the data provided through colorimetry. They take readings in the region of every 5–20 nanometers along the visible region, and produce a spectral reflectance curve or a data stream for alternative presentations. These curves can be used to test a new batch of colorant to check if it makes a match to specifications, e.g., ISO printing standards.

Traditional visible region spectrophotometers cannot detect if a colorant or the base material has fluorescence. This can make it difficult to manage color issues if for example one or more of the printing inks is fluorescent. Where a colorant contains fluorescence, a bi-spectral fluorescent spectrophotometer is used. There are two major setups for visual spectrum spectrophotometers, d/8 (spherical) and 0/45. The names are due to the geometry of the light source, observer and interior of the measurement chamber. Scientists use this instrument to measure the amount of compounds in a sample. If the compound is more concentrated more light will be absorbed by the sample; within small ranges, the Beer–Lambert law holds and the absorbance between samples vary with concentration linearly. In the case of printing measurements two alternative settings are commonly used- without/with uv filter to control better the effect of uv brighteners within the paper stock.

Samples are usually prepared in cuvettes; depending on the region of interest, they may be constructed of glass, plastic (visible spectrum region of interest), or quartz (Far UV spectrum region of interest). Some applications require small volume measurements which can be performed with micro-volume platforms.

===Applications===
* Estimating dissolved organic carbon concentration
* Specific ultraviolet absorbance for metric of aromaticity
* Bial&#x27;s test for concentration of pentoses

===Experimental application===
As described in the applications section, spectrophotometry can be used in both qualitative and quantitative analysis of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Qualitative analysis can be used and spectrophotometers are used to record spectra of compounds by scanning broad wavelength regions to determine the absorbance properties (the intensity of the color) of the compound at each wavelength. One experiment that can demonstrate the various uses that visible spectrophotometry can have is the separation of β-galactosidase from a mixture of various proteins. Largely, spectrophotometry is best used to help quantify the amount of purification your sample has undergone relative to total protein concentration. By running an affinity chromatography, B-Galactosidase can be isolated and tested by reacting collected samples with Ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) and determining if the sample turns yellow. Following this testing the sample at 420 nm for specific interaction with ONPG and at 595 for a Bradford Assay the amount of purification can be assessed quantitatively. In addition to this spectrophotometry can be used in tandem with other techniques such as SDS-Page electrophoresis in order to purify and isolate various protein samples.

==IR spectrophotometry==

Spectrophotometers designed for the infrared region are quite different because of the technical requirements of measurement in that region. One major factor is the type of photosensors that are available for different spectral regions, but infrared measurement is also challenging because virtually everything emits IR as thermal radiation, especially at wavelengths beyond about 5 μm.

Another complication is that quite a few materials such as glass and plastic absorb infrared, making it incompatible as an optical medium. Ideal optical materials are salts, which do not absorb strongly. Samples for IR spectrophotometry may be smeared between two discs of potassium bromide or ground with potassium bromide and pressed into a pellet. Where aqueous solutions are to be measured, insoluble silver chloride is used to construct the cell.

==Spectroradiometers==
Spectroradiometers, which operate almost like the visible region spectrophotometers, are designed to measure the spectral density of illuminants. Applications may include evaluation and categorization of lighting for sales by the manufacturer, or for the customers to confirm the lamp they decided to purchase is within their specifications. Components:

# The light source shines onto or through the sample.
# The sample transmits or reflects light.
# The detector detects how much light was reflected from or transmitted through the sample.
# The detector then converts how much light the sample transmitted or reflected into a number.

<text>The flag of the [[Cook Islands]], officially known as the Cook Islands Ensign, is based on the traditional design for former British colonies in the Pacific region. It is a blue ensign containing the Union Flag in the upper left, and on the right, fifteen stars in a ring. The Union Flag is symbolic of the nation&#x27;s historic ties to the United Kingdom and to the Commonwealth of Nations. The stars stand for the fifteen islands that make up the Cook Islands (Tongareva, Rakahanga, Manihiki, Pukapuka, Nassau, Suwarrow, Palmerston, Aitutaki, Manuae, Takutea, Atiu, Mitiaro, Mauke, Rarotonga and Mangaia). The blue represents the ocean and the peaceful nature of the inhabitants.

==History==
A Federal Flag Bill was proposed in the Cook Islands Parliament in 1892, but was not assented to. The proposed flag had consisted of three horizontal stripes (red, white, red), with a Union Flag in the top left corner, overlaid by a black coconut palm tree on a white circle. When the islands were annexed by New Zealand in 1901, the New Zealand flag was used instead.

In 1973 a contest was held to design a new flag, with 120 entries. The winner was chosen at a meeting of the cabinet, judging panel and the flag design committee, a green ensign with 15 gold stars in a circle. The gold was to represent the &quot;friendliness of Cook Islanders and their hope, faith, dedication, love and happiness&quot;; the circle represented &quot;unity and strength of purpose and the moulding of 15 islands into one united people&quot;; the stars were &quot;symbols of heaven, faith in god and the power that has guided Cook Islanders throughout their history&quot;; and the green background was to represent the &quot;nation, the vitality of the land and the people of the evergreen and lasting growth of the Cook Islands&quot;. The new flag was raised for the first time on 24 January 1974.

In 1979 it was replaced by the current flag.

In December 2023, Prime Minister Mark Brown suggested that the national flag should be changed back to the 1973–1979 version, claiming that it would be better reflective of the Cook Islands&#x27; national colours and sovereignty. In January 2024, Brown further suggested that the decision on the flag could be put to a referendum.

<doc id="480484" wikidata="Q7804400" url="?curid=480484" title="Tim Traveller">
<text>Tim Traveller was a British comic strip created by Vic Neill and published in the British comics magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. He first appeared in issue 2862, dated 24 May 1997, as part of a continuing set of six new comic strips where the one with the most votes would be voted into the comic by readers.

==Concept==

The first strip featured Tim looking for a bicycle in the town dump, and finding an unusual one. Pulling a dial at the front he was transported to caveman times, at which point he realised the bike could travel through time. He and Crazy for Daisy were the joint winners of the poll, beating Camp Cosmos, Have a Go Jo, Sydd and Trash Can Ally. It was drawn by Vic Neill until his death in 2000. However, Neill strips continued to run for some time in the comic as they had been stockpiled. Once these had run out, Keith Reynolds drew it up to 2004 when the strip was dropped. Only 5 strips appeared in the character&#x27;s final twelve months in the comic. In the 2003 Beano annual, his strip was drawn by Richard Elson.

Tim Traveller would use his bicycle to travel back and forth in time, encountering all sorts of crazy mishaps, occasionally getting in so much trouble he had to rush back to the present day to avoid it. Some of his trips resulted in him causing or learning the truth about various historical mysteries, such as why the Leaning Tower of Pisa leaned (it fell over in an earthquake and Tim only managed to partly pull it back into position) or what happened to the crew of the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; (Tim visited the ship and fell into a large fish, appearing to the crew as a sea monster, causing them to dive overboard).

The character was revived briefly in 2019 this time written by Tommy Donbavand.

<text>The coat of arms of the [[Cook Islands]] has a shield as its focal point. The shield is blue with fifteen white stars arranged in a circle, as found on the national flag, and is supported by a flying fish (&quot;maroro&quot;) and a white tern (&quot;kakaia&quot;). The helmet is an ariki head-dress (&quot;pare kura&quot;) of red feathers, symbolising the importance of the traditional rank system, and the name of the nation is on a scroll below the shield. The achievement is augmented by a cross and a Rarotongan club (&quot;momore taringavaru&quot;) used by orators during traditional discourses, respectively symbolizing Christianity and the richness of Cook Islands&#x27; tradition, placed in saltire behind the shield.

The coat of arms was designed by Mataiapo Metuakore Teremoana Ngametua Tutakiao Kora , also known as Papa Motu Kora.

<doc id="480495" wikidata="Q2014687" url="?curid=480495" title="Odissi">
<text>Odissi (ଓଡ଼ିଶୀ) also referred to as Orissi in old literature, oldest surviving classical dance of India, is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the temples of Odisha – an eastern coastal state of India. Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women, and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism through songs written and composed according to the &quot;ragas&quot; &amp; &quot;talas&quot; of Odissi music by ancient poets of the state. Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu deities Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses (Shaktism).

The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of Kalingan temples, and archeological sites related to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It was suppressed under British Rule. The suppression was protested by the Indians, followed by its revival, reconstruction and expansion since India gained independence from the colonial rule.

Odissi is traditionally a dance-drama genre of performance art, where the artist(s) and musicians play out a story, a spiritual message or devotional poem from the Hindu texts, using symbolic costumes, body movement, &quot;abhinaya&quot; (expressions) and &quot;mudras&quot; (gestures and sign language) set out in ancient Sanskrit literature. Classical Odia literature &amp; the Gita Govinda set to traditional Odissi music are used for the &quot;abhinaya&quot;. Odissi is learnt and performed as a composite of basic dance motif called the &quot;Bhangas&quot; (symmetric body bends, stance). It involves lower (footwork), mid (torso) and upper (hand and head) body as three sources of perfecting expression and audience engagement with geometric symmetry and rhythmic musical resonance. An Odissi performance repertoire includes invocation, &quot;nritta&quot; (pure dance), &quot;nritya&quot; (expressive dance), &quot;natya&quot; (dance drama) and &quot;moksha&quot; (dance climax connoting salvation of the soul and spiritual release).

Traditional Odissi exists in two major styles, the first perfected by women and focussed on solemn, spiritual temple dance (&quot;maharis&quot;); the second perfected by boys dressed as girls (&quot;gotipuas&quot;) which diversified to include athletic and acrobatic moves, and were performed from festive occasions in temples to general folksy entertainment. Modern Odissi productions by Indian artists have presented a diverse range of experimental ideas, culture fusion, themes and plays.

Odissi was the only Indian dance form present in Michael Jackson&#x27;s 1991 hit single &quot;Black or White&quot;.

==History of Odissi==
The foundations of Odissi are found in &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text of performance arts. The basic dance units described in the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, all 108 of them, are identical to those in Odissi. The text is attributed to the ancient scholar Bharata Muni, and its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE. The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters. The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures – all of which are part of Indian classical dances. Dance and performance arts, states this ancient text, are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues and the essence of scriptures. The Natya Shastra refers to four &quot;pravrittis&quot; (methods of expressive delivery) in vogue – &quot;Avanti&quot;, &quot;Dakshinatya&quot;, &quot;Panchali&quot; and &quot;Odra-Magadhi&quot; ; of these, the &quot;Odra&quot; refers to Odisha.

More direct historical evidence of dance and music as an ancient performance art are found in archaeological sites such as caves and in temple carvings of Bhubaneswar, Konark and Puri. The Manchapuri cave in Udayagiri shows carvings of dance and musicians, and this has been dated to the time of Jain king Kharavela in the first or second century BCE. The Hathigumpha inscriptions, also dated to the same ruler, mention music and dance :
(he [the king]) versed in the science of the &quot;Gandharvas&quot; (i.e., music), entertains the capital with the exhibition of &quot;dapa&quot;, dancing, singing and instrumental music and by causing to be held festivities and assemblies (samajas)...
— &quot;Hathigumpha inscription, Line 5&quot;, ~ 2nd–1st century BCE 
The classical music tradition of Odisha, known as Odissi music, also has ancient roots. Archeologists have reported the discovery of 20-key, carefully shaped polished basalt lithophone in Sankarjang, the highlands of Odisha, which is dated to about 1000 BCE.

===Medieval era===

The Hindu, Jain and Buddhist archaeological sites in Odisha state, particularly the Assia range of hills show inscriptions and carvings of dances that are dated to the 6th to 9th century CE. Important sites include the Ranigumpha in Udaygiri, and various caves and temples at Lalitgiri, Ratnagiri and Alatgiri sites. The Buddhist icons, for example, are depicted as dancing gods and goddesses, with Heruka, Vajravarahi, and Marichi in Odissi-like postures. Historical evidence, states Alexandra Carter, shows that Odissi &quot;Maharis&quot; (Hindu temple dancers) and dance halls architecture (&quot;nata-mandapa&quot;) were in vogue at least by the 9th century CE.

According to Kapila Vatsyayan, the &quot;Kalpasutra&quot; of Jainism, in its manuscripts discovered in Gujarat, includes classical Indian dance poses – such as the &quot;Samapada&quot;, the &quot;Tribhangi&quot; and the &quot;Chauka&quot; of Odissi. This, states Vatsyayan, suggests that Odissi was admired or at least well known in distant parts of India, far from Odisha in the medieval era, to be included in the margins of an important Jain text. However, the Jain manuscripts use the dance poses as decorative art in the margins and cover, but do not describe or discuss the dance. Hindu dance texts such as the &quot;Abhinaya Chandrika&quot; and &quot;Abhinaya Darpana&quot; provide a detailed description of the movements of the feet, hands, the standing postures, the movement and the dance repertoire. It includes illustrations of the &quot;karana&quot;s mentioned in &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;. Similarly, the illustrated Hindu text on temple architecture from Odisha, the &quot;Shilpa Prakasha&quot;, deals with Odia architecture and sculpture, and includes Odissi postures.
Actual sculptures that have survived into the modern era and panel reliefs in Odia temples, dated to be from the 10th to 14th century, show Odissi dance. This is evidenced in Jagannatha temple in Puri, as well as other temples of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Vedic deities such as Surya (Sun) in Odisha. There are several sculptures of dancers and musicians in Konark Sun Temple and Brahmeswara Temple in Bhubaneswar.

The composition of the poetic texts by 8th century Shankaracharya and particularly of divine love inspired &quot;Gitagovinda&quot; by 12th century Jayadeva influenced the focus and growth of modern Odissi. Odissi was performed in the temples by the dancers called &quot;Maharis&quot;, who played out these spiritual poems and underlying religious plays, after training and perfecting their art of dance starting from an early age, and who were revered as auspicious to religious services.

===Mughal and British period===
After 12th-century, Odia temples, monasteries and nearby institutions such as the Puspagiri in the eastern Indian subcontinent came under waves of attacks and ransacking by Muslim armies, a turmoil that impacted all arts and eroded the freedoms previously enjoyed by performance artists. The official records of Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq&#x27;s invasion in Odisha (13601361 CE), for example, describe the destruction of the Jagannath temple as well as numerous other temples, defacing of dancing statues, and ruining of dance halls. This led to a broad decline in Odissi and other religious arts, but there were some benevolent rulers in this period who supported arts particularly through performances at courts. During the Sultanate and Mughal era of India, the temple dancers were moved to entertain the Sultan&#x27;s family and courts. They became associated with concubinage to the nobility.
The Odissi dance likely expanded in the 17th century, states Alexandra Carter, under King Ramachandradeva&#x27;s patronage. This expansion integrated martial arts (&quot;akhanda&quot;) and athletics into Odissi dance, by engaging boys and youth called &quot;Gotipuas&quot;, as a means to physically train the young for the military and to resist foreign invasions. According to Ragini Devi, historical evidence suggests that the &quot;Gotipuas&quot; tradition was known and nurtured in the 14th century, by Raja of Khordha.

During the British Raj, the officials of the colonial government ridiculed the temple traditions, while Christian missionaries launched a sustained attack on the moral outrage of sensuousness of Odissi and other Hindu temple dance arts. In 1872, a British civil servant named William Hunter watched a performance at the Jagannatha temple in Puri, then wrote, &quot;Indecent ceremonies disgraced the ritual, and dancing girls with rolling eyes put the modest worshipper to the blush...&quot;, and then attacked them as idol-worshipping prostitutes who expressed their devotion with &quot;airy gyrations&quot;.

Christian missionaries launched the &quot;anti-dance movement&quot; in 1892, to ban all such dance forms. The dancers were frequently stigmatized as prostitutes by Europeans during the colonial era. In 1910, the British colonial government in India banned temple dancing, and the dance artists were reduced to abject poverty from the lack of any financial support for performance arts, combined with stereotyping stigma.

===Post-independence===
The temple dance ban and cultural discrimination during colonial rule marshalled a movement by Hindus to question the stereotypes and to revive the regional arts of India, including Odissi. Due to these efforts, the classical Indian dances witnessed a period of renaissance and reconstruction, which gained momentum particularly after Indians gained their freedom from colonialism.

Odissi, along with several other major Indian dances gained recognition after efforts by many scholars and performers in the 1950s, particularly by Kavichandra Kalicharan Pattanayak, an Oriya poet, dramatist and researcher. Pattanayak is also credited with naming the dance form as &quot;Odissi&quot;.

==Repertoire==

Odissi, in the classical and medieval period has been, a team dance founded on Hindu texts. This drama-dance involved women (&quot;Maharis&quot;) enacting a spiritual poem or a religious story either in the inner sanctum of a Hindu temple, or in the &quot;Natamandira&quot; attached to the temple. The Odissi performing &quot;Maharis&quot; combined pure dance with expression, to play out and communicate the underlying text through &quot;abhinaya&quot; (gestures). The performance art evolved to include another aspect, wherein teams of boys – dressed as girls – called &quot;Gotipuas&quot; expanded the Odissi repertoire, such as by adding acrobatics and athletic moves, and they performed both near the temples and open fairs for general folksy entertainment. In the Indian tradition, many of the accomplished &quot;gotipuas&quot; became the gurus (teachers) in their adulthood. Modern Odissi is a diversified performance art, men have joined the women, and its reconstruction since the 1950s have added new plays and aspects of other Indian dances.

Love is a universal theme and one of the paradigmatic values in Indian religions. This theme is expressed through sensuous love poems and metaphors of sexual union in Krishna-related literature, and as longing eros (&quot;Shringara&quot;) in its dance arts such as in Odissi, from the early times. Hinduism, states Judith Hanna, encourages the artist to &quot;strive to suggest, reveal or re-create the infinite, divine self&quot;, and art is considered as &quot;the supreme means of realizing the Universal Being&quot;. Physical intimacy is not something considered as a reason for shame, rather considered a form of celebration and worship, where the saint is the lover and the lover is the saint. This aspect of Odissi dancing has been subdued in the modern post-colonial reconstructions, states Alexandra Carter, and the emphasis has expanded to &quot;expressions of personal artistic excellence as ritualized spiritual articulations&quot;.

The traditional Odissi repertoire, like all classical Indian dances, includes &quot;Nritta&quot; (pure dance, solo), &quot;Nritya&quot; (dance with emotions, solo) and &quot;Natya&quot; (dramatic dance, group). These three performance aspects of Odissi are described and illustrated in the foundational Hindu texts, particularly the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, &quot;Abhinaya Darpana&quot; and the 16th-century &quot;Abhinaya Chandrika&quot; by Maheshwara Mahapatra of Odisha.
*The &quot;Nritta&quot; performance is abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of the dance. The viewer is presented with pure movement in Nritta, wherein the emphasis is the beauty in motion, form, speed, range and pattern. This part of the repertoire has no interpretative aspect, no telling of story. It is a technical performance, and aims to engage the senses (prakriti) of the audience.
*The &quot;Nritya&quot; is slower and expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, storyline particularly with spiritual themes in Hindu dance traditions. In a &quot;nritya&quot;, the dance-acting expands to include silent expression of words through the sign language of gestures and body motion set to musical notes. This part of a repertoire is more than sensory enjoyment, it aims to engage the emotions and mind of the viewer.
*The &quot;Natyam&quot; is a play, typically a team performance, but can be acted out by a solo performer where the dancer uses certain standardized body movements to indicate a new character in the underlying story. A &quot;Natya&quot; incorporates the elements of a &quot;Nritya&quot;.
*The &quot;Mokshya&quot; is a climatic pure dance of Odissi, aiming to highlight the liberation of soul and serenity in the spiritual.

Odissi dance recitals are in Odia and Sanskrit language in the music strictly follows ragas &amp; talas of the Odissi music tradition. The talas used in Odissi dance are &quot;Ekatali, Khemata, Rupaka, Tripata, Jhampa, Jati Tala, Adatali, Matha, Aditala, Sarimana, Kuduka&quot; and others.

===Sequence===
Traditional Odissi repertoire sequence starts with an invocation called &quot;Mangalacharana&quot;. A &quot;shloka&quot; (hymn) in praise of a god or goddess is sung, such as to Jagannath (an avatar of Vishnu), the meaning of which is expressed through dance. Mangalacharana is followed by &quot;Pushpanjali&quot; (offering of flowers) and &quot;Bhumi Pranam&quot; (salutation to mother earth). The invocation also includes &quot;Trikhandi Pranam&quot; or the three-fold salutation – to the devas (gods), to the gurus (teachers) and to the lokas or rasikas (fellow dancers and audience).
The next sequential step in an Odissi performance is &quot;Batu&quot;, also known as &quot;Battu Nrutya&quot; or &quot;Sthayee Nrutya&quot; or &quot;Batuka Bhairava&quot;. It is a fast pace, pure dance (&quot;nritta&quot;) performed in the honor of Shiva. There is no song or recitation accompanying this part of the dance, just rhythmic music. This pure dance sequence in Odissi builds up to a Pallavi which is often slow, graceful &amp; lyrical movements of the eyes, neck, torso &amp; feet &amp; slowly builds in a crescendo to climax in a fast tempo at the end.

The &quot;nritya&quot; follows next, and consists of &quot;Abhinaya&quot;, or an expressional dance which is an enactment of a song or poetry. The dancer(s) communicate the story in a sign language, using &quot;mudras&quot; (hand gestures), &quot;bhavas&quot; (enacting mood, emotions), eye and body movement. The dance is fluid, graceful and sensual. Abhinaya in Odissi is performed to verses recited in Sanskrit or Odia language. Most common are Abhinayas on Oriya songs or Sanskrit &quot;Ashthapadi&quot;s or Sanskrit &quot;stuti&quot;s like the &quot;Dashavatara Stotra&quot; (depicting the ten incarnations of Vishnu) or the &quot;Ardhanari Stotra&quot; (half man, half woman form of the divine). Many regionally performed Abhinaya compositions are based on the Radha-Krishna theme. The Astapadis of the Radha-Krishna love poem &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; written by Jayadeva are usually performed in Odisha, as part of the dance repertoire.

The &quot;natya&quot; part, or dance drama, is next in sequence. Usually Hindu mythologies, epics and legendary dramas are chosen as themes.

A distinctive part of the Odissi tradition is the inclusion of &quot;Moksha&quot; (or &quot;Mokshya&quot;) finale in the performance sequence. This the concluding item of a recital. Moksha in Hindu traditions means “spiritual liberation”. This dance movement traditionally attempts to convey a sense of spiritual release and soul liberation, soaring into the realm of pure aesthetics. Movement and pose merge in a fast pace pure dance climax.
=== Basic moves and mudras ===
The basic unit of Odissi are called &quot;bhangas&quot;. These are made up of eight &quot;belis&quot;, or body positions and movements, combined in many varieties. Motion is &quot;uthas&quot; (rising or up), &quot;baithas&quot; (sitting or down) or &quot;sthankas&quot; (standing). The gaits or movement on the dance floor is called &quot;chaalis&quot;, with movement tempo linked to emotions according to the classical Sanskrit texts. Thus, for example, &quot;burhas&quot; or quick pace suggest excitement, while a slow confused pace suggests dejection. For aesthetics, movement is centered on a core, a point in space or floor, and each dancer has her imaginary square of space, with spins and expression held within it. The foot movement or &quot;pada bhedas&quot; too have basic dance units, and Odissi has six of these, in contrast to four found in most classical Indian dances.

The three primary dance positions in Odissi are:
*&quot;Chouka&quot; – the square position, with weight equally placed on the two legs in a squatting position, spine straight, arms raised up with elbows bent.
*&quot;Abhanga&quot; – the body weight shifts to one foot, while the feet and knees are kept forward in a standing position, one hip extending sideways and torso deflected away from supporting leg.
*&quot;Tribhanga&quot; – is an S-shaped three-fold bending of body, with torso deflecting in one direction while the head and hips deflecting in the opposite direction of torso. Further, the hands and legs frame the body into a composite of two squares (rectangle), providing an aesthetic frame of reference. This is described in the ancient Sanskrit texts, and forms of it are found in other Hindu dance arts, but &quot;tribhanga&quot; postures developed most in and are distinctive to Odissi, and they are found in historic Hindu temple reliefs.

&quot;Mudras&quot; or &quot;Hastas&quot; are hand gestures which are used to express the meaning of a given act. Like all classical dances of India, the aim of Odissi is in part to convey emotions, mood and inner feelings in the story by appropriate hand and facial gestures. There are 63 &quot;Hastas&quot; in modern Odissi dance, and these have the same names or structure as those in the pan-Indian Hindu texts, but most closely matching those in the &quot;Abhinaya Chandrika&quot;. These are subdivided into three, according to the traditional texts:
* Asamyukta Hasta – Single hand Mudras – 28 Prakar (gestures, for instance to communicate a salute, prayer, embrace, energy, bond, swing, carriage, shell, arrow, holding a thing, wheel, and so on.)
* Samyukta Hasta – Double hand Mudras – 24 Prakar (gestures, for instance to indicate a flag, flower, type of bird or animal, moon, action like grasping, and so on.)
* Nritya Hasta – “Pure Dance” Mudras

The Mudra system is derived from the &quot;Abhinaya Darpana&quot; by Nandikeshavara and the ancient &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; of Bharata Muni.

===Costumes===

The Odissi dancers are colorfully dressed with makeup and jewellery. The sari worn by Odissi dancers are brightly coloured, and usually of local silk (&quot;Pattasari&quot;). It is worn with pleats, or may have a pleat tailor stitched in front, to allow maximum flexibility during the footwork. These saris have traditional prints of Odisha with regional designs and embellishments, and may be the Sambalpuri sari and Bomkai sari.

The jewellery includes silver pieces, a metal favored in regional tradition. The hair is tied up, and typically drawn into an elaborate bun resembling a Hindu temple spire, and decorated with &quot;seenthi&quot;. The hairstyle may contain a moon shaped crest of white flowers, or a reed crown called &quot;mukoot&quot; with peacock feathers (symbolism for Krishna). The dancers forehead is marked with &quot;tikka&quot;, and adorned with various jewelry such as the &quot;allaka&quot; (head piece on which the tikka hangs). The eyes are ringed with kajal (black eyeliner).

Ear covers called &quot;kapa&quot; or ear rings decorate the sides of the head, while necklace adorns the neck. The dancer wears a pair of armlets also called &quot;bahichudi&quot; or &quot;bajuband&quot;, on the upper arm. The wrist is covered with &quot;kankana&quot; (bangles). At the waist they wear an elaborate belt which ties down one end of the sari. The ankles are decorated with a leather piece on top of which are bells (&quot;ghungroo&quot;). The dancer&#x27;s palms and soles may be painted with red coloured dye called the &quot;alta&quot;.

Modern Odissi male performers wear &quot;dhoti&quot; – a broadcloth tied around waist, pleated for movement, and tucked between legs; usually extends to knee or lower. Upper body is bare chested, and a long thin folded translucent sheet wrapping over one shoulder and usually tucked below a wide belt.

=== Music and instruments ===
Odissi dance is accompanied by the traditional classical music of the state of Odisha, Odissi music. Rooted in the ancient ritual music tradition dedicated to Lord Jagannatha, Odissi music has a rich history spanning over two thousand years, distinguished by its unique &quot;sangita-shastra&quot;s (musical treatises), a specialized system of Ragas and Talas, and a distinctive style of performance characterised by the &quot;andolita gamaka&quot;. The primary Odissi &quot;mela&quot; ragas are &quot;Kalyana&quot;, &quot;Nata&quot;, &quot;Sri&quot;, &quot;Baradi&quot;, &quot;Gouri, Panchama&quot;, &quot;Dhanasri&quot;, &quot;Karnata&quot;, &quot;Bhairabi&quot; and &quot;Sokabaradi&quot;.

Odissi dance, states Ragini Devi, is a form of &quot;visualized music&quot;, wherein the &quot;Ragas&quot; and &quot;Raginis&quot;, respectively the primary and secondary musical modes, are integrated by the musicians and interpreted through the dancer. Each note is a means, has a purpose and with a mood in classical Indian music, which Odissi accompanies to express sentiments in a song through &quot;Parija&quot;. This is true whether the performance is formal, or less formal as in &quot;Nartana&quot; and &quot;Natangi&quot; used during festive occasions and the folksy celebration of life.

Like most Indian dance forms, an Odissi troupe performs with the accompaniment of a musical ensemble. The mini-orchestra consists of a number of instruments, often varying slightly by region; the ubiquitous &quot;tanpura&quot; is used for a consistent, droning ambience throughout, with the &quot;mardala&quot; for percussion. Melodic instruments range from the harmonium, &quot;bansuri&quot; (bamboo flute) or &quot;sarangi&quot; to the &quot;sitar&quot; and violin. Additionally, &quot;manjira&quot; (finger cymbals) or other small, percussive instruments may be used. At times, vocalists may be featured, usually singing simple, rhythmic phrases and melodies with dancing specifically choreographed to match.

===Styles===
The Odissi tradition existed in three schools: &quot;Mahari, Nartaki&quot;, and &quot;Gotipua&quot;:

* &quot;Maharis&quot; were Odia devadasis or temple girls, their name deriving from &quot;Maha&quot; (great) and &quot;Nari&quot; (girl), or &quot;Mahri&quot; (chosen) particularly those at the temple of Jagganath at Puri. Early Maharis performed &quot;Nritta&quot; (pure dance) and Abhinaya (interpretation of poetry) dedicated to various Hindu gods and goddesses, as well as Puranic mythologies and Vedic legends. Later, Maharis especially performed dance sequences based on the lyrics of Jayadev&#x27;s &quot;Gita Govinda&quot;. This style is more sensuous and closer to the classical Sanskrit texts on dance, music and performance arts.
* &quot;Gotipuas&quot; were boys dressed up as girls and taught the dance by the Maharis. This style included martial arts, athletics and acrobatics. Gotipuas danced to these compositions outside the temples and fairgrounds as folksy entertainment.
* &quot;Nartaki&quot; dance took place in the royal courts, where it was prevalent before the British period.

== Schools, training and recognition ==

=== Odissi maestros and performers ===
Kelucharan Mohapatra, Pankaj Charan Das, Deba Prasad Das and Raghunath Dutta were the four major gurus who revived Odissi in the late forties and early fifties. Sanjukta Panigrahi was a leading disciple of Kelucharan Mohapatra who popularized Odissi by performing in India and abroad. In the mid-sixties, three other disciples of Kelucharan Mohapatra, Kumkum Mohanty and Sonal Mansingh, were known for their performances in India and abroad. Some other notable disciples include, Debi Basu, Jhelum Paranjape, Shubhada Varadkar, Daksha Mashruwala and Nandita Behera. Laximipriya Mohapatra performed a piece of Odissi abhinaya in the Annapurna Theatre in Cuttack in 1948, a show upheld as the first classical Odissi dance performance after its contemporary revival. Guru Mayadhar Raut played a pivotal role in giving Odissi dance its classical status. He introduced &quot;Mudra Vinyoga&quot; in 1955 and &quot;Sancharibhava&quot; in the Odissi dance items, and portrayed &quot;Shringara Rasa&quot; in &quot;Gita Govinda Ashthapadis&quot;. His notable compositions include &quot;Pashyati Dishi Dishi&quot; and &quot;Priya Charu Shile&quot;, composed in 1961.

== Schools ==
=== IIT Bhubaneswar ===
Odissi has been included in Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar&#x27;s BTech syllabus since 2015 as the first Indian national technical institute to introduce any classical dance in syllabus.

===In Guinness World records===
Guinness World Records has acknowledged the feat of the largest congregation of Odissi dancers in a single event. 555 Odissi dancers performed at the event hosted on 23 December 2011, in the Kalinga stadium, Bhubaneswar, Odisha. The dancers performed the &quot;mangalacharana, Battu, Pallavi, Abhinaya&quot; and &quot;Mokshya&quot; dance items from the Odissi repertoire.

More than 1000 Odissi dancers performed at the World Cultural Festival 12 March 2016. This is till date the largest congregation of Odissi dancers in a single event.

===Odissi Centre at Oxford University===

An Odissi dance centre has been opened from January 2016, at the University of Oxford. Known as Oxford Odissi Centre, it is an initiative of the Odissi dancer and choreographer Baisali Mohanty who is also a post-graduate scholar at the University of Oxford.

Beside holding regular Odissi dance classes at its institution, the Oxford Odissi Centre also conducts Odissi dance workshops at other academic institutions in the United Kingdom.

<text>32P/Comas Solà is a periodic comet with a current orbital period of 8.8 years.

The comet nucleus is estimated to be 8.4 kilometers in diameter.

==History==
&quot;32P/Comas Solà&quot; was discovered November 5, 1926, by Josep Comas Solà. As part of his work on asteroids for the Fabra Observatory (Barcelona), he was taking photographs with a telescope. The comet&#x27;s past orbital evolution became a point of interest as several astronomers suggested early on that the comet might be a return of the then lost periodic comet &quot;Spitaler&quot; (113P/Spitaler). In 1935 additional positions had been obtained, and P. Ramensky investigated the orbital motion back to 1911. He noted the comet passed very close to Jupiter during May 1912 and that, prior to this approach, the comet had a perihelion distance of 2.15 AU and an orbital period of 9.43 years. The identity with comet &quot;Spitaler&quot; was thus disproven.

In 1933, the Danish astronomer Julie Vinter Hansen undertook significant new research which calculated the orbit of the comet up to 1980, predicting when it would return to the Earth&#x27;s orbit.

In 1969, Soviet astronomers Klim Churyumov and Svetlana Gerasimenko searched for 32P/Comas Solà on photographic plates, and serendipously discovered a new comet, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

==Trivia==

The title of the early Tangerine Dream piece &quot;Fly and Collision of Coma[s] Sola&quot;, appearing on the &quot;Alpha Centauri&quot; (1971) album, refers to this comet, which at the time was undergoing a moderately close (0.73 AU) approach to Jupiter.

<doc id="480497" wikidata="Q5593889" url="?curid=480497" title="Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album was an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to artists, producers, and engineers for quality gospel music albums. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Originally called the Grammy Award for Best Southern Gospel Album, the award was first presented to Bruce Carroll at the 33rd Grammy Awards in 1991 for the album &quot;The Great Exchange&quot;. Three years later, the category&#x27;s name was changed to the Best Southern Gospel, Country Gospel or Bluegrass Gospel Album. The category&#x27;s name was changed to Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album in 1998. After 2011 it was merged with the Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album and the Grammy Award for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album, forming the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Album. The NARAS made this change in order to &quot;tighten the number of categories&quot; at the Grammy Awards. In 2015, a similar category, Best Roots Gospel Album was introduced.

Bill Gaither has the most wins in the category, with a total of four: two from his work in the Gaither Vocal Band, and another two in combination with his wife, Gloria. Randy Travis has won one less Grammy than Gaither in this category, with three. Gaither has the most nominations in the category, with eleven; the Light Crust Doughboys have eight, trailing Gaither by three nominations. Kyle Lehning holds the record for most wins as a producer or engineer, with a total of three. Nominated bands include Karen Peck and New River, who were selected in three of the final four years of the Grammy, and the Cathedral Quartet.

<text>Brian Brooke Claxton (23 August 1898 – 13 June 1960) was a Canadian veteran of World War I, federal Minister of National Health and Welfare and Minister of National Defence.

==Early life==
He was born in Montreal and received his early education at Lower Canada College. He was a gifted student and entered McGill University in September 1915 after completing grade 11. While at McGill he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Society. After a year at university he left McGill in 1916 and enlisted with the Victoria Rifles of Canada.

==Professional career and achievements==
He served overseas with the Royal Indian Field Artillery on the Western Front, and saw action, which experience marked him profoundly. He was promoted to the rank of Battery Sergeant-Major in the field and was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.

Returning to Canada after the War, Claxton completed his course at McGill, graduating with honours in Law. He practised his profession in Montreal. In 1939 he was created a King&#x27;s Counsel. He had an academic post at McGill where he was associate professor of commercial law until 1944.

Claxton was active in community service. He served as President of the Canadian Club of Montreal, Chairman of the Montreal branch of the Canadian Institute of International Affairs, chairman of the Board of Governors of Lower Canada College from 1925 until 1934, and was a graduate fellow of the Corporation of McGill University. The burgeoning nationalism after World War I led Claxton to become involved in associations such as the Canadian League and the League of Nations Society. He was also an intervenor on behalf of the federal government in the constitutional issue concerning jurisdiction over radio broadcasting. He was active in laying the foundations for the establishment of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

==Political career==


His political career began in the general election of 1940 when he was first elected to the House of Commons as Liberal Member for the constituency of St. Lawrence-St. George, Montreal. He was re-elected in 1945 and again in 1949. He was appointed in 1943 as Parliamentary Assistant to the Prime Minister. He served in the federal Liberal cabinets of Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent. In 1944 he was named the first Minister of the newly created Department of National Health (1944–46). He was responsible for the organization of the department and implementation of the administration system for the universal Family Allowances social welfare scheme. In 1946 Claxton became Minister of National Defence in which portfolio he served until 1954.

In 1947 he headed the Canadian delegation to the British Commonwealth Conference on Japan held in Australia. As vice-chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Newfoundland, in 1949 he signed the terms of union on behalf of Canada. He represented Canada at the meetings of the Defence Committee under the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington, D.C., Paris and The Hague. As Minister of National Defence he guided post-war demobilization, helped shape Canadian Cold War foreign policy, and presided over Canada&#x27;s participation in the Korean War. 
In 1947, Claxton reopened RMC as a 3-service cadet college offering a 4-year academic degree. He said, &quot;The role of the officer in modern war can only be properly discharged if they have education and standing in the community comparable to that of any of the other professions as well as high qualities of character and physique.&quot;

In 1949 he appointed Rear-Admiral Rollo Mainguy to head a commission of inquiry into the so-called &quot;mutinees&quot; on several navy ships that year. The Mainguy Report found no sign of Communist subversion, and noted that the sailors involved had some justified grievances.

==Family==
Claxton&#x27;s brother-in-law was Second Lieutenant Donaldson Lizars Savage who died on 15 November 1916 at the age of 20. Savage was killed in action in Somme, France the same year he graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada. Savage, who served in the 56th Field Coy, Royal Engineers, informed Claxton about the recruiting (hazing) practises then in place at the RMC. As Minister of National Defence, Claxton gave instructions that abuses would not be tolerated when RMC reopened after the war.

==Later life==
In 1954 he retired from politics, but continued to play an important role in the creation of the Canada Council. He was just sixty-one when he died. At his death in 1960, The Montreal Gazette wrote that the Honourable Brooke Claxton &quot;faced death … with unbreakable courage.&quot; He astounded associates by working hard right to the end and &quot;never relaxing his grip.&quot;

He was honoured by the University of Saskatchewan with the degree of Doctor of Laws at its Golden Jubilee Convocation in 1959.

The Brooke Claxton Building in Ottawa, where the Department of Health is based, was named in his honour.

<doc id="480500" wikidata="Q7841215" url="?curid=480500" title="Tricky Dicky (Topper)">
<text>Tricky Dicky is a British comic strip which debuted in the magazine &quot;Topper&quot; in December 1976 and was drawn by John Dallas. From 1979 to 1986 he was the cover star of the comic, succeeding Danny&#x27;s Tranny and preceding Beryl the Peril. The strip survived the merger with the Beezer in 1990 and continued in The combined Beezer and Topper comic til it ended in 1993. The character later reappeared in The Beano.

==Concept==

The comic strip was a gag-a-day strip starring a young boy named Dicky, who plays practical jokes on people, but they usually managed to get the last laugh. From 1999 to 2000 he re-appeared as a &#x27;Guest Star&#x27; in &quot;The Beano&quot;, again drawn by Dallas, running against The Three Bears, Inspector Horse and Jocky and Gordon Bennett to be voted into the comic by readers, though The Three Bears was the winner. The basic premise of the strip was expanded to include that Dicky&#x27;s father now owned a joke shop, explaining where he got all these jokes from. In Issue #4 of BeanoMAX, Tricky Dicky makes a surprise guest one-off appearance with a new look trying to trick Ball Boy, but it doesn&#x27;t work. Tricky Dicky also starred alongside &quot;Roger the Dodger&quot; in the &quot;Beano Summer Special 2003&quot;. Tricky Dicky reappeared in a new strip in &quot;The Beano&quot; in 2013, this time drawn by Laura Howell. This new strip was a reboot with Tricky Dicky&#x27;s appearance being changed and the character being given the new first name of Gordon. In the new strip, he is a more heroic figure, as he only plays pranks on people who deserve it.

==Comparison to other comics with the same name==

A character of the same name appeared in the children&#x27;s TV series ZZZap!. Another trickster child character of the same name, but otherwise a different character appeared in the &quot;Cor!!&quot; Comic published by Fleetway. And, finally a character called &quot;Tricky Dicky Doyle&quot; appeared in The Dandy in 1997.

==Appearances in Annuals==
Tricky Dicky was put in the 2020 Annual as his own comic strip, but he did have an appearance on the Beano Annual 2016 cover. He also appeared in the 2017 Annual as a non-speaking character.

<doc id="480507" wikidata="Q1207302" url="?curid=480507" title="Jar">
<text>A jar is a rigid, cylindrical or slightly conical container, typically made of glass, ceramic, or plastic, with a wide mouth or opening that can be closed with a lid, screw cap, lug cap, cork stopper, roll-on cap, crimp-on cap, press-on cap, plastic shrink, heat sealed lidding film, an inner seal, a tamper-evident band, or other suitable means. The English word &quot;jar&quot; originates from the Arabic word &quot;jarra&quot;, which means an earthen pot or vessel.

== Background == 
Jars can be used to hold solids too large to be removed from, or liquids too viscous to be poured through a bottle&#x27;s neck; these may be foods, cosmetics, medications, or chemicals. Glass jars—among which the most popular is the mason jar—can be used for storing and preserving items as diverse as jam, pickled gherkin, other pickles, marmalade, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, jalapeño peppers, chutneys, pickled eggs, honey, and many others.

== Types ==
* Bell jar – typically used in scientific laboratories to produce a vacuum; also used in Victorian times for display purposes
* Cookie jar – typically ceramic or glass, common in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom
* Killing jar – used to kill captured insects
* Leyden jar – a historical electrical capacitor
* Specimen jar – an instrument used in anatomy to preserve specimens
* Apothecary jar – historically for storage of medicines; made of ceramics or more typically in modern centuries, clear glass. Typically cylindrical or with rotationally symmetric decorative curves, sometimes with a glass disc foot separated from the main body. Modern glass versions are also used for artistic display of the contents.

;Modern glass food storage jars come in a variety of shapes, all of which have a circular opening on top for screwing on a lid:
* Economy round or wide mouth jars – tall but rotund cylinder slightly rounded at the top and bottom, relatively wide with a wide mouth, commonly used for sauces like a mayonnaise
* Paragon jars – tall and narrow cylinder, commonly used for pickled foods such as olives 
* French square or Victorian jars – roughly a small cube
* Spice jars – small cylinder or rectangular cuboid
* Hexagon or hex jars – regular hexagonal prism
* Mason jars – moderately tall cylinder typically used in home canning, sealed with a metal lid
* Kilner jar – similar to a Mason jar but sealed with rubber
* Straight-sided jars – cylinders with no neck. Squat straight-sided jars are suitable for creams which can be scooped out.

;Ancient ceramic types include:
* Amphora – large, but typically holding under 50 L
* Pithos – very large, typically the size of a person and holding hundreds of liters, Pandora&#x27;s Box is often referred to as Pithos
* canopic jar

== Utility ==
Jars are sterilised by putting them in a pressure cooker with boiling water or an oven for a number of minutes. Glass jars are considered microwavable.

Some regions have a legally mandated deposit refundable upon return of the jar to its retailer, after which the jar is recycled according to the SPI recycling code for the material.

<doc id="480509" wikidata="Q213385" url="?curid=480509" title="Bhāskara II">
<text>Bhāskara II (&#x27;; 1114–1185), also known asBhāskarāchārya&quot;&#x27; (), was an Indian polymath, mathematician, astronomer and engineer. From verses in his main work, Siddhānta Śiromaṇi, it can be inferred that he was born in 1114 in Vijjadavida (Vijjalavida) and living in the Satpura mountain ranges of Western Ghats, believed to be the town of Patana in Chalisgaon, located in present-day Khandesh region of Maharashtra by scholars. In a temple in Maharashtra, an inscription supposedly created by his grandson Changadeva, lists Bhaskaracharya&#x27;s ancestral lineage for several generations before him as well as two generations after him. Henry Colebrooke who was the first European to translate (1817) Bhaskaracharya II&#x27;s mathematical classics refers to the family as Maharashtrian Brahmins residing on the banks of the Godavari.

Born in a Hindu Deshastha Brahmin family of scholars, mathematicians and astronomers, Bhaskara II was the leader of a cosmic observatory at Ujjain, the main mathematical centre of ancient India. Bhāskara and his works represent a significant contribution to mathematical and astronomical knowledge in the 12th century. He has been called the greatest mathematician of medieval India. His main work, &quot;Siddhānta-Śiromaṇi&quot; (Sanskrit for &quot;Crown of Treatises&quot;), is divided into four parts called &quot;Līlāvatī&quot;, &quot;Bījagaṇita&quot;, &quot;Grahagaṇita&quot; and &quot;Golādhyāya&quot;, which are also sometimes considered four independent works. These four sections deal with arithmetic, algebra, mathematics of the planets, and spheres respectively. He also wrote another treatise named &quot;Karaṇā Kautūhala&quot;.

==Date, place and family==
Bhāskara gives his date of birth, and date of composition of his major work, in a verse in the Āryā metre:
This reveals that he was born in 1036 of the Shaka era (1114 CE), and that he composed the &quot;Siddhānta Shiromani&quot; when he was 36 years old. &quot;Siddhānta Shiromani&quot; was completed during 1150 CE. He also wrote another work called the &quot;Karaṇa-kutūhala&quot; when he was 69 (in 1183). His works show the influence of Brahmagupta, Śrīdhara, Mahāvīra, Padmanābha and other predecessors. Bhaskara lived in Patnadevi located near Patan (Chalisgaon) in the vicinity of Sahyadri.

He was born in a Deśastha Rigvedi Brahmin family near Vijjadavida (Vijjalavida). 
Munishvara (17th century), a commentator on Siddhānta Shiromani of Bhaskara has given the information about the location of Vijjadavida in his work Marīci Tīkā as follows:
This description locates Vijjalavida in Maharashtra, near the Vidarbha region and close to the banks of Godavari river. However scholars differ about the exact location. Many scholars have placed the place near Patan in Chalisgaon Taluka of Jalgaon district whereas a section of scholars identified it with the modern day Beed city. Some sources identified Vijjalavida as Bijapur or Bidar in Karnataka. Identification of Vijjalavida with Basar in Telangana has also been suggested.

Bhāskara is said to have been the head of an astronomical observatory at Ujjain, the leading mathematical centre of medieval India. History records his great-great-great-grandfather holding a hereditary post as a court scholar, as did his son and other descendants. His father Maheśvara (Maheśvaropādhyāya) was a mathematician, astronomer and astrologer, who taught him mathematics, which he later passed on to his son Lokasamudra. Lokasamudra&#x27;s son helped to set up a school in 1207 for the study of Bhāskara&#x27;s writings. He died in 1185 CE.

==The &quot;Siddhānta-Śiromaṇi&quot;==

===Līlāvatī===

The first section &quot;Līlāvatī&quot; (also known as &quot;pāṭīgaṇita&quot; or &quot;aṅkagaṇita&quot;), named after his daughter, consists of 277 verses. It covers calculations, progressions, measurement, permutations, and other topics.

===Bijaganita===
The second section &quot;Bījagaṇita&quot;(Algebra) has 213 verses. It discusses zero, infinity, positive and negative numbers, and indeterminate equations including (the now called) Pell&#x27;s equation, solving it using a &quot;kuṭṭaka&quot; method. In particular, he also solved the formula_1 case that was to elude Fermat and his European contemporaries centuries later

===Grahaganita===
In the third section &quot;Grahagaṇita&quot;, while treating the motion of planets, he considered their instantaneous speeds. He arrived at the approximation: It consists of 451 verses

: formula_2 for. 
: formula_3 close to formula_4, or in modern notation:
: formula_5.
In his words:
This result had also been observed earlier by Muñjalācārya (or Mañjulācārya) mānasam, in the context of a table of sines.

Bhāskara also stated that at its highest point a planet&#x27;s instantaneous speed is zero.

==Mathematics==

Some of Bhaskara&#x27;s contributions to mathematics include the following:

* A proof of the Pythagorean theorem by calculating the same area in two different ways and then cancelling out terms to get &quot;a&quot;2 + &quot;b&quot;2 = &quot;c&quot;2.
* In &quot;Lilavati&quot;, solutions of quadratic, cubic and quartic indeterminate equations are explained.
* Solutions of indeterminate quadratic equations (of the type &quot;ax&quot;2 + &quot;b&quot; = &quot;y&quot;2).
* Integer solutions of linear and quadratic indeterminate equations (&quot;Kuṭṭaka&quot;). The rules he gives are (in effect) the same as those given by the Renaissance European mathematicians of the 17th century.
* A cyclic Chakravala method for solving indeterminate equations of the form &quot;ax&quot;2 + &quot;bx&quot; + &quot;c&quot; = &quot;y&quot;. The solution to this equation was traditionally attributed to William Brouncker in 1657, though his method was more difficult than the &quot;chakravala&quot; method.
* The first general method for finding the solutions of the problem &quot;x&quot;2 − &quot;ny&quot;2 = 1 (so-called &quot;Pell&#x27;s equation&quot;) was given by Bhaskara II.
* Solutions of Diophantine equations of the second order, such as 61&quot;x&quot;2 + 1 = &quot;y&quot;2. This very equation was posed as a problem in 1657 by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, but its solution was unknown in Europe until the time of Euler in the 18th century.
* Solved quadratic equations with more than one unknown, and found negative and irrational solutions.
* Preliminary concept of mathematical analysis.
* Preliminary concept of differential calculus, along with preliminary ideas towards integration.
* preliminary ideas of differential calculus and differential coefficient.
* Stated Rolle&#x27;s theorem, a special case of one of the most important theorems in analysis, the mean value theorem. Traces of the general mean value theorem are also found in his works.
* Calculated the derivative of sine function, although he did not develop the notion of a derivative. (See Calculus section below.)
* In &quot;Siddhanta-Śiromaṇi&quot;, Bhaskara developed spherical trigonometry along with a number of other trigonometric results. (See Trigonometry section below.)

=== Arithmetic ===
Bhaskara&#x27;s arithmetic text &quot;Līlāvatī&quot; covers the topics of definitions, arithmetical terms, interest computation, arithmetical and geometrical progressions, plane geometry, solid geometry, the shadow of the gnomon, methods to solve indeterminate equations, and combinations.

&quot;Līlāvatī&quot; is divided into 13 chapters and covers many branches of mathematics, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and a little trigonometry and measurement. More specifically the contents include:

* Definitions.
* Properties of zero (including division, and rules of operations with zero).
* Further extensive numerical work, including use of negative numbers and surds.
* Estimation of π.
* Arithmetical terms, methods of multiplication, and squaring.
* Inverse rule of three, and rules of 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11.
* Problems involving interest and interest computation.
* Indeterminate equations (Kuṭṭaka), integer solutions (first and second order). His contributions to this topic are particularly important, since the rules he gives are (in effect) the same as those given by the renaissance European mathematicians of the 17th century, yet his work was of the 12th century. Bhaskara&#x27;s method of solving was an improvement of the methods found in the work of Aryabhata and subsequent mathematicians.

His work is outstanding for its systematisation, improved methods and the new topics that he introduced. Furthermore, the &quot;Lilavati&quot; contained excellent problems and it is thought that Bhaskara&#x27;s intention may have been that a student of &#x27;Lilavati&#x27; should concern himself with the mechanical application of the method.

===Algebra===
His &quot;Bījaganita&quot; (&quot;Algebra&quot;) was a work in twelve chapters. It was the first text to recognize that a positive number has two square roots (a positive and negative square root). His work &quot;Bījaganita&quot; is effectively a treatise on algebra and contains the following topics:

* Positive and negative numbers.
* The &#x27;unknown&#x27; (includes determining unknown quantities).
* Determining unknown quantities.
* Surds (includes evaluating surds and their square roots).
* &quot;Kuṭṭaka&quot; (for solving indeterminate equations and Diophantine equations).
* Simple equations (indeterminate of second, third and fourth degree).
* Simple equations with more than one unknown.
* Indeterminate quadratic equations (of the type ax2 + b = y2).
* Solutions of indeterminate equations of the second, third and fourth degree.
* Quadratic equations.
* Quadratic equations with more than one unknown.
* Operations with products of several unknowns.

Bhaskara derived a cyclic, &quot;chakravala&quot; method for solving indeterminate quadratic equations of the form ax2 + bx + c = y. Bhaskara&#x27;s method for finding the solutions of the problem Nx2 + 1 = y2 (the so-called &quot;Pell&#x27;s equation&quot;) is of considerable importance.

===Trigonometry===

The &quot;Siddhānta Shiromani&quot; (written in 1150) demonstrates Bhaskara&#x27;s knowledge of trigonometry, including the sine table and relationships between different trigonometric functions. He also developed spherical trigonometry, along with other interesting trigonometrical results. In particular Bhaskara seemed more interested in trigonometry for its own sake than his predecessors who saw it only as a tool for calculation. Among the many interesting results given by Bhaskara, results found in his works include computation of sines of angles of 18 and 36 degrees, and the now well known formulae for formula_6 and formula_7.

===Calculus===
His work, the &quot;Siddhānta Shiromani&quot;, is an astronomical treatise and contains many theories not found in earlier works. Preliminary concepts of Differential calculus and mathematical analysis, along with a number of results in trigonometry that are found in the work are of particular interest.

Evidence suggests Bhaskara was acquainted with some ideas of differential calculus. Bhaskara also goes deeper into the &#x27;differential calculus&#x27; and suggests the differential coefficient vanishes at an extremum value of the function, indicating knowledge of the concept of &#x27;infinitesimals&#x27;.

* There is evidence of an early form of Rolle&#x27;s theorem in his work. The modern formulation of Rolle&#x27;s theorem states that if formula_8, then formula_9 for some formula_10 with formula_11.
* In this astronomical work he gave one procedure that looks like a precursor to infinitesimal methods. In terms that is if formula_12 then formula_13 that is a derivative of sine although he did not develop the notion on derivative.
** Bhaskara uses this result to work out the position angle of the ecliptic, a quantity required for accurately predicting the time of an eclipse.
* In computing the instantaneous motion of a planet, the time interval between successive positions of the planets was no greater than a &quot;truti&quot;, or a of a second, and his measure of velocity was expressed in this infinitesimal unit of time.
* He was aware that when a variable attains the maximum value, its differential vanishes.
* He also showed that when a planet is at its farthest from the earth, or at its closest, the equation of the centre (measure of how far a planet is from the position in which it is predicted to be, by assuming it is to move uniformly) vanishes. He therefore concluded that for some intermediate position the differential of the equation of the centre is equal to zero. In this result, there are traces of the general mean value theorem, one of the most important theorems in analysis, which today is usually derived from Rolle&#x27;s theorem. The mean value formula for inverse interpolation of the sine was later founded by Parameshvara in the 15th century in the &quot;Lilavati Bhasya&quot;, a commentary on Bhaskara&#x27;s &quot;Lilavati&quot;.

Madhava (1340–1425) and the Kerala School mathematicians (including Parameshvara) from the 14th century to the 16th century expanded on Bhaskara&#x27;s work.

==Astronomy==
Using an astronomical model developed by Brahmagupta in the 7th century, Bhāskara accurately defined many astronomical quantities, including, for example, the length of the sidereal year, the time that is required for the Sun to orbit the Earth, as approximately 365.2588 days which is the same as in Surya siddhanta. The modern accepted measurement is 365.25636 days, a difference of 3.5 minutes.

His mathematical astronomy text Siddhanta Shiromani is written in two parts: the first part on mathematical astronomy and the second part on the sphere.

The twelve chapters of the first part cover topics such as:

* Mean longitudes of the planets.
* True longitudes of the planets.
* The three problems of diurnal rotation. Diurnal motion refers to the apparent daily motion of stars around the Earth, or more precisely around the two celestial poles. It is caused by the Earth&#x27;s rotation on its axis, so every star apparently moves on a circle that is called the diurnal circle.
* Syzygies.
* Lunar eclipses.
* Solar eclipses.
* Latitudes of the planets.
* Sunrise equation.
* The Moon&#x27;s crescent.
* Conjunctions of the planets with each other.
* Conjunctions of the planets with the fixed stars.
* The paths of the Sun and Moon.

The second part contains thirteen chapters on the sphere. It covers topics such as:

*Praise of study of the sphere.
*Nature of the sphere.
*Cosmography and geography.
*Planetary mean motion.
*Eccentric epicyclic model of the planets.
*The armillary sphere.
*Spherical trigonometry.
*Ellipse calculations.
*First visibilities of the planets.
*Calculating the lunar crescent.
*Astronomical instruments.
*The seasons.
*Problems of astronomical calculations.

==Engineering==
The earliest reference to a perpetual motion machine date back to 1150, when Bhāskara II described a wheel that he claimed would run forever.

Bhāskara II invented a variety of instruments one of which is &quot;Yaṣṭi-yantra&quot;. This device could vary from a simple stick to V-shaped staffs designed specifically for determining angles with the help of a calibrated scale.

==Legends==
In his book &quot;Lilavati&quot;, he reasons: &quot;In this quantity also which has zero as its divisor there is no change even when many quantities have entered into it or come out [of it], just as at the time of destruction and creation when throngs of creatures enter into and come out of [him, there is no change in] the infinite and unchanging [Vishnu]&quot;.

===&quot;Behold!&quot;===
It has been stated, by several authors, that Bhaskara II proved the Pythagorean theorem by drawing a diagram and providing the single word &quot;Behold!&quot;. Sometimes Bhaskara&#x27;s name is omitted and this is referred to as the &quot;Hindu proof&quot;, well known by schoolchildren.

However, as mathematics historian Kim Plofker points out, after presenting a worked-out example, Bhaskara II states the Pythagorean theorem:
This is followed by:
Plofker suggests that this additional statement may be the ultimate source of the widespread &quot;Behold!&quot; legend.

==Legacy==
A number of institutes and colleges in India are named after him, including Bhaskaracharya Pratishthana in Pune, Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences in Delhi, Bhaskaracharya Institute For Space Applications and Geo-Informatics in Gandhinagar.

On 20 November 1981 the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched the Bhaskara II satellite honouring the mathematician and astronomer.

Invis Multimedia released &quot;Bhaskaracharya&quot;, an Indian documentary short on the mathematician in 2015.

<text>James Alexander Watson (born July 30, 1961) is a Canadian politician who served as the 56th mayor of Ottawa from 2010 to 2022. Previously, he served as an Ottawa city councillor from 1991 to 1997, and as mayor from 1997 to 2000.

Watson subsequently represented the riding of Ottawa West—Nepean in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2010. He served in the Cabinet of Premier Dalton McGuinty in the portfolios of Consumer and Business Services (2003–2005), Health Promotion (2005–2007), and Municipal Affairs and Housing (2007–2010). He resigned in January 2010 to run for mayor in the 2010 Ottawa municipal election. He was re-elected mayor in 2014 and in 2018. On March 20, 2021, Watson became the longest serving mayor in the city&#x27;s history, surpassing Stanley Lewis who held office from 1936 to 1948.

==Early life==
Watson was born on July 30, 1961, in Montreal, Quebec as the second child to Frances (née Murdoch) and Beverley &quot;Bev&quot; Watson. He grew up in Lachute, but his family moved a few times during his childhood for his father&#x27;s work, taking him to Beaconsfield, Thornhill, and Sarnia. He graduated from high school from Northern Collegiate in Sarnia. Watson later moved to Ottawa to attend Carleton University and graduated in 1983 with a Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communications from the Faculty of Public Affairs. He first got involved in the political sphere during his second year of studies in 1982, when he served as the President of the Rideau River Residence Association (RRRA). Watson began his career working in journalism for a few local newspapers, and later entered the federal public service, where he rose to the position of Director of Communications for the Speaker of the House of Commons.

==Municipal politics in Ottawa==
===City Council===
Watson first entered public office in 1991 when he was elected to pre-amalgamation Ottawa&#x27;s City Council as councillor for Capital Ward. He was subsequently re-elected to Council in 1994. In 1992 Watson championed a roll-back of salaries and operating costs at the city level. His first direct action against excessive city spending was his unilateral decision to donate his yearly 2% salary increase, totalling $700, to charity. In addition, as part of the re-election process Watson donated his severance pay of $5200 to four local charities after moving from Regional to City Council in 1994. During his second term as councillor, Watson reduced his own salary by 13% from $51,000 to $45,000 while voting to reduce the mayor&#x27;s office budget and salary. In 1996, he supported Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s bid to lead the Ontario Liberal party, though at the time he still considered himself a &quot;Red Tory&quot;, dating back from his university days when he was a member of the Progressive Conservatives.

===First mayoral term (pre-amalgamation)===
In 1997, Watson sought election as Mayor of Ottawa, winning 83 per cent of the popular vote to become Ottawa&#x27;s youngest-ever mayor at age 36. During his term as mayor, Watson&#x27;s emphasis centred on ensuring that the City adopt sustainable fiscal management policies which would enable overall operating costs to go down while reducing budget deficits and the city&#x27;s debt burden. In conjunction, Watson managed to freeze property tax rates for two consecutive years. He also championed a plan with two other councillors, Peter Hume and John O&#x27;Neil, to save the historic Aberdeen Pavilion from being torn down.

==After municipal politics==
Watson resigned as mayor on August 14, 2000 to become president and CEO of the Canadian Tourism Commission. During his time with the federal crown corporation, Watson secured additional funding for the industry following the 2001 crisis of the 9/11 attacks and the softening of the global tourism industry.

In 2003, Watson left public service to pursue a career in media as host of CHRO-TV&#x27;s &quot;The New RO @ Noon&quot;. He was also a regular contributor to the Ottawa radio station CFRA and the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;.

Watson has served on the board or as honorary chair of several community organizations including the Riverside Hospital, the National Arts Centre, the Central Canada Exhibition Association, the Christmas Exchange of Ottawa and the Forum for Young Canadians. He served as chair of the United Way&#x27;s 2002 campaign, which raised a record $21 million.

==Provincial politics==

In the 2003 provincial election, Watson defeated Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario incumbent Garry Guzzo to become the Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the Ottawa West-Nepean riding and was appointed by Premier of Ontario Dalton McGuinty as Minister of Consumer and Business Services on October 23, 2003. He became Ontario&#x27;s first Minister of Health Promotion on June 29, 2005.

===Minister of Consumer and Business Services===
Watson worked alongside the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) to create a &quot;Fraud Free Calendar&quot; in order to help protect consumers, particularly seniors, from high pressure sales tactics, which often lead to impulse purchases. In the spring of 2004, the Federal and Provincial governments signed a joint service delivery accord, creating a &quot;one stop shop&quot; in many communities for provincial and federal services. This accord later included municipalities, in order to provide many government services in one location, for example Ottawa City Hall. Upon inheriting a massive backlog in birth certificate applications, Watson took action to streamline the delivery process for online applicants. After a cabinet shuffle, Dalton McGuinty and Gerry Phillips implemented a money-back guarantee to individuals who do not receive a birth certificate within 15 days of the online application, which Watson had initiated.

===Minister of Health Promotion===
Watson initiated a study designed to help Ontarians quit smoking. STOP – Smoking Treatment for Ontario Patients – offered free nicotine replacement therapy to 14,000 smokers across the province. On May 31, 2006, the Smoke-Free Ontario Act came into effect, banning all smoking in public areas in the province, including in restaurants, bars, casinos, etc. Watson was recognized for its implementation. In June of that year, Watson unveiled a $10-million Healthy Eating and Active Living Plan. The plan took aim at childhood obesity, which included a pilot project in Northern schools, offering fruits and vegetables to the students and a program that looked to develop and improve safe biking and walking to and from schools. In 2006, the Ontario government launched a project which provided financial assistance to Ontario athletes looking to perform at the national and international levels. Quest For Gold is now part of the Ontario Athlete Assistance Program (OAAP), funded by the Government of Ontario, through the Ministry of Tourism, Culture &amp; Sport. The Program provided direct financial assistance to Ontario athletes through an &quot;Ontario Card&quot; designation. The intent of the OAAP is to provide funding to individual athletes based on their demonstrated commitment to high performance sport, allowing them to pursue athletic excellence at the highest levels of national and international competition.

===Minister of Municipal Affairs===
After the 2007 election, Watson became Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. During his tenure as Queen&#x27;s Park&#x27;s official liaison with Ontario&#x27;s municipalities, Watson was able to implement substantive policies to alleviate fiscal pressure on cities. In February 2008, Watson brought forward the Rental Opportunity for Ontario Families (ROOF) program that helps low-income families with funds to pay rent over a five-year period. In October of that year, a policy designed to support the uploading of property tax supported programs from the budgets of Ontario&#x27;s municipalities to that of the Provincial budget was implemented. Under this policy, the province took back $1.5 billion worth of programs funded by Ontario&#x27;s municipalities, reversing previous downloading of provincial responsibilities which occurred during Mike Harris’ tenure as premier. The provincial government assumed responsibility for Ontario Works social assistance services, paramedic services, public health, transit, drug benefit programs, the Ontario Disability Support Program, court services, and property tax assessment. In addition, Watson signed the Federal-Provincial Housing Agreement in 2008, the largest housing agreement of its kind to date.

=== Summary of Cabinet Portfolios ===

==Second mayoral term (New City of Ottawa)==
On January 12, 2010, Watson resigned from cabinet in order to run for mayor of Ottawa in the 2010 Ottawa municipal election. Watson won the election with almost 50% of the vote.

Upon taking office, Watson froze his own salary and cut his office budget by 10%. As mayor, he committed to limit tax increases to no more than 2.5%, and did so, bringing in the lowest rates in a number of years. He also enacted a set of integrity and transparency measures, including hiring an integrity commissioner, launching a lobbyist registry and requiring that elected officials’ office expenses be posted online. He also froze community recreation fees for four years, and reduced the size of the city&#x27;s workforce twice, the first time it had been done since amalgamation.

Watson and the Ottawa City Council also invested $340 million in infrastructure renewal projects such as roads, sidewalks, pathways and sewers and record amount in cycling initiatives. Watson helped advance two major city-building projects that had stalled for a number of years: the revitalization of Lansdowne Park and the introduction of light rail transit. In October 2012, the city council approved the final Lansdowne Park plan, an agreement with the Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group that saw the existing stadium significantly renovated, increased green space, and housing and retail added to the site. In December 2012, City Council voted unanimously to move forward with the Confederation Line, a 12.5 km light rail transit line from Tunney&#x27;s Pasture in the west to Blair in the east, to be fully operational by 2018.

Watson also helped create Invest Ottawa, the city&#x27;s economic development agency, whose programs and initiatives increase entrepreneurial momentum, wealth and jobs in Ottawa.

==Third mayoral term==
Watson won the mayoral race in 2014 with 76.20% of the votes, defeating eight other candidates.

===International economic trips===
On November 16, 2015, Watson lead an economic mission to China and Thailand with hopes of promoting Ottawa as a leading innovation hub in Canada, to draw investment for Ottawa businesses, and to encourage tourism to the nation&#x27;s capital. Watson and fifteen local business leaders began the mission in Beijing, Ottawa&#x27;s only sister city, where he signed an &quot;Exchange and Co-operation Agreement&quot; with Beijing mayor Guo Jinlong, establishing key common goals in business, trade, and municipal administration. The agreement states the mutual support of local enterprises to invest in each other&#x27;s cities, as well as enhanced co-operation in the high-tech industry.
A year later, on April 17, 2016, Watson led a delegation of 35 leaders in the business and tech industries to generate investment opportunities in technology, education, film production and tourism. In addition to seizing the significant economic growth opportunities in India, the trade mission also afforded the City of Ottawa and Invest Ottawa the opportunity to leverage the experience of many successful, local Indo-Canadian business leaders. The mission&#x27;s resulting list of Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), strategic partnerships and mutually beneficial agreements between Ottawa companies and their Indian counterparts has an estimated total value of more than $80 million.

===Significant projects===
Since 2014, Watson has led many significant projects in the city. Set to become one of the largest infrastructure projects in the city&#x27;s history, the city secured more than $1.15 billion from the federal government to help the expansion of the Light Rail Transit (LRT) network of the completed Confederation Line, which will move the public transportation further east, south, and west.
Watson pushed to have the Mayors of Ottawa and Gatineau to join the Board of the National Capital Commission (NCC) in 2016. That year, Watson and Gatineau mayor Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin were invited to join as ex-officio, non-voting members.

The city has invested a record $80M since 2014 for cycling and pedestrian structures. City council unanimously approved downtown Ottawa&#x27;s second segregated bike lane in 2015 and built the 2.5-kilometre north-south cycling spine between Parliament Hill and Lansdowne Park on O’Connor Street. In addition, the NCC worked alongside Watson, as well as Nathalie Des Rosiers and Elizabeth Moore Aubin, to open another segregated cycling lane on Mackenzie Avenue, creating a safer environment for cyclists in the Ottawa region.
Watson played a key role in the opening of the Innovation Centre at Bayview Yards, the new home for Invest Ottawa and an entrepreneurial hub for the Ottawa region. It is expected to engage over 1200 businesses within the city, assisting them to grow and develop their products, as well as create over 280 jobs within the capital region.
Watson and the City of Ottawa have been working in conjunction to reduce the impact of sewage overflows and storm water on the Ottawa River. The Ottawa River Action Plan (ORAP) is made up of 17 individual projects which aim to enhance the health of the Ottawa River and to protect Ottawa&#x27;s water environment. 
Watson supported the arts community towards redeveloping the Arts Court and expanding the Ottawa Art Gallery. The project is part of a vision for the revitalization of the downtown core in Ottawa. The project includes environmentally-controlled exhibition and curatorial spaces, event and education facilities, a café and a gift shop.

===Ottawa 2017===
As Canada celebrated its 150th year since Confederation, the City of Ottawa created a group in charge of putting together a full year of activities and events. The Ottawa 2017 Bureau, under Guy Laflamme, was responsible for organizing signature events throughout the year, attracting millions of visitors to Ottawa to experience them. Over the course of year, the city played host to a number of successful events including the 2017 Red Bull Crashed Ice downhill skating competition, the Juno Awards of 2017; La Machine (production company), a four-day show that attracted over 750,000 people, Ottawa Welcomes the World, a series of celebrations at Lansdowne Park to promote tourism in other countries and strengthen ties with those nations, the 105th Grey Cup at TD Place, and the 2017 NHL 100 Classic, an outdoor game between the Ottawa Senators and the Montreal Canadiens that recreated the first ever NHL game almost 100 years later.

==Fourth mayoral term==
On October 22, Watson won the 2018 mayoral race with 71.03% of the votes, defeating eleven other candidates.

Watson oversaw the launch of the Confederation Line, a rail system that opened to the public on September 14, 2019. He has also played an instrumental role to open a new central library to the city&#x27;s downtown core at LeBreton Flats - a state-of-the-art net carbon zero facility. During this term, in an article published in the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; on August 17, 2019, Watson came out as gay after 40 years of being closeted. From 2018 to 2022, Watson led Ottawa through natural disasters, including two floods, tornados, a global pandemic (COVID-19), and the 2022 Freedom Convoy.

On March 20, 2021, Watson became Ottawa&#x27;s longest serving mayor, passing J.E. Stanley Lewis&#x27; previous record. On December 10, 2021, Watson announced he would not be running for re-election in the upcoming 2022 Ottawa municipal election.

===2022 Freedom Convoy protest===

On Sunday, February 6, 2022, Watson proclaimed a state of emergency to handle a 10-day blockade as part of the Freedom Convoy 2022 that shut down much of the city&#x27;s core.

=== &quot;The Watson Club&quot; ===
After his re-election, some councillors expressed concern over Watson&#x27;s apparent stranglehold over several councillors. The urban-suburban split between councillors saw Watson siding with more-suburban councillors, whom he appointed to chair every committee.

<doc id="480516" wikidata="Q1137402" url="?curid=480516" title="Aspleniaceae">
<text>The Aspleniaceae (spleenworts) are a family of ferns, included in the order Polypodiales. The composition and classification of the family have been subject to considerable changes. In particular, there is a narrow circumscription, Aspleniaceae s.s. (adopted here), in which the family contains only two genera, and a very broad one, Aspleniaceae s.l., in which the family includes 10 other families kept separate in the narrow circumscription, with the Aspleniaceae s.s. being reduced to the subfamily Asplenioideae. The family has a worldwide distribution, with many species in both temperate and tropical areas. Elongated unpaired sori are an important characteristic of most members of the family.

==Description==
Members of the family grow from rhizomes, that are either creeping or somewhat erect, and are usually but not always unbranched, and have scales that usually have a lattice-like (clathrate) structure. In some species, for example &quot;Asplenium nidus&quot;, the rhizomes form a kind of basket which collects detritus. The leaves may be undivided or be divided, with up to four-fold pinnation. The sori are characteristic of the family. They are elongated, and normally located on one side of a vein. More rarely, they may be in pairs on a single vein, but then they never curve over the vein. A flap-like indusium arises along one edge of a sorus. The leaf stalks (petioles) have two vascular bundles, uniting to form an X-shape in cross-section towards the tip of the leaf. The stalks of the sporangia are one cell wide in the middle.

==Taxonomy==
The family Aspleniaceae was first described by Edward Newman in 1840. Newman included three genera: &quot;Athyrium&quot;, &quot;Asplenium&quot; and &quot;Scolopendrium&quot;. &quot;Athyrium&quot; is now placed in a different family, Athyriaceae, not considered very strongly related to the Aspleniaceae, and &quot;Scolopendrium&quot; is regarded as synonym of &quot;Asplenium&quot;.

The narrow circumscription of the family adopted by the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) recognizes only two genera, &quot;Asplenium&quot; and &quot;Hymenasplenium&quot;. &quot;Asplenium&quot; has previously been split into a dozen or so genera, including &quot;Diella&quot;, found only in Hawaii. The consensus of molecular phylogenetic studies is that all are nested within &quot;Asplenium&quot;. PPG I places Aspleniaceae in the suborder Aspleniineae of the order Polypodiales.

Earlier, Christenhusz and Chase had proposed a much broader circumscription of Aspleniaceae, in which it consisted of all the separate families that PPG I places in the suborder Aspleniineae (eight at the time), with the families reduced to subfamilies. Thus the Aspleniaceae of PPG I became the subfamily Asplenioideae. , the broader circumscription of the Aspleniaceae is used by Plants of the World Online, which lists 24 genera.

===Phylogenic relationships===
Aspleniaceae is placed in a clade known as eupolypods II, or more formally as suborder Aspleniineae. The following cladogram, based on Lehtonen (2011) and Rothfels &amp; al. (2012), shows a likely phylogenic relationship between the Aspleniaceae and the other families in the clade.
===Genera===
In the PPG I system, Aspleniaceae s.s. contains two genera:
*&quot;Asplenium&quot; – about 700 species, worldwide
*&quot;Hymenasplenium&quot; – about 40 species, tropical and subtropical

==Distribution and habitat==
The Aspleniaceae have a worldwide distribution, with the large genus &quot;Asplenium&quot; being native to almost all parts of the world except Antarctica and some high Arctic areas. The family is unusual in having high diversity in both temperate and tropical areas, and more-or-less equal numbers of terrestrial and epiphytic species. Plants are terrestrial, growing in the ground, lithophytic, growing on rocks, or epiphytic, growing on other plants; less often they are aquatic, growing in moving water.

<text>The Konik or Polish Konik, , is a Polish breed of small horse or pony. There are semi-feral populations in some regions. They are usually mouse dun or striped dun. 

The Bilgoray, , of south-eastern Poland is a sub-type of the breed influenced by Arab and Thoroughbred blood; it is close to extinction. The extinct Sweyki or Schweike sub-type of East Prussia contributed to the development of the Trakehner.

The word &quot;konik&quot; means &#x27;small horse&#x27;. It may be used in a wider sense to describe the Polish Konik and other similar breeds, among them the Hucul pony of the Carpathian Mountains, the Polesian of Belarus and the Žemaitukas of Lithuania.

== Etymology ==

The Polish word &quot;konik&quot; (plural &quot;koniki&quot;) is the diminutive of &quot;koń&quot;, the Polish word for &quot;horse&quot; (sometimes confused with &quot;kuc, kucyk&quot; meaning &quot;pony&quot;). It means &#x27;small horse&#x27;. 

== History ==
The Konik is a Polish horse breed descending from very hardy horses from the Biłgoraj region. These horses had a predominantly dun colour, but also black and chestnut horses were present in the population. Some researchers claim these foundation animals were hybrids with wild horse breeding that had been sold to farmers by the zoo in Zamość in 1806, which were bred to local domesticated draft horses. However, genetic studies now contradict the view that the Konik is a surviving form of Eastern European wild horse, commonly called the tarpan, nor is it closely related to them. The Konik shares mitochondrial DNA with many other domesticated horse breeds and their Y chromosome is nearly identical.

During World War I, these horses were important transport animals for Russian and German troops and were called &quot;Panje&quot; horses. In 1923, Tadeusz Vetulani, an agriculturalist from Kraków, started to get interested in the&quot; Panje&quot; horses, a landrace of Biłgoraj and coined the name &quot;Konik&quot; (Polish for &quot;small horse&quot;), which is now established as the common name for the breed. During the 1920s, several public and private studs were created to conserve this animal. In 1936, Vetulani opened a Konik reserve in the Białowieża Forest. He was convinced that if horses were exposed to natural conditions, they would redevelop their original phenotype. While Vetulani&#x27;s experiments are well-known and widely publicized, his stock actually had only a minor influence on the modern Konik population. However, World War II marked the end of Vetulani&#x27;s &quot;breeding back&quot; project. Part of his stock was moved to Popielno, where they continued to live in semi-feral conditions. Popielno became the breed&#x27;s main stud during the 1950s, but the herd was also preserved by buying animals from Germany.

Between the two world wars, the German brothers Heinz and Lutz Heck crossed stallions of Przewalski&#x27;s horse with mares of the Konik horse, as well as mares of other breeds such as the Dülmener, Gotland Russ, and the Icelandic horse, to create a breed resembling their understanding of the tarpan phenotype. The result is called the Heck horse. Other breeders crossed Koniks with Anglo-Arabians or the Thoroughbred to increase their quality as a riding horse.

==Characteristics==

The breed has a strong and stocky build, small head with a straight profile, and a neck set low out of the chest. The Konik has a deep chest, a thick mane, and the hair coat is blue dun, often colloquially called &quot;mouse-gray&quot;. The Konik is short in height, ranging from . Minimum heartgirth measurement is , and minimum cannon bone measurement for mares, for stallions. Weight is .

== Breeding centres and nature reserves ==

Koniks today are bred either in barns or open reserves and under human guidance. The Konik was bred for a larger shoulder height in past decades, to improve its value as a working horse. A more graceful appearance, especially of the head, was established, as well. Black and sorrel horses have been largely selected out, but still appear on occasion, as do white markings. The simultaneous management of Koniks in both barns and reserves made it possible to compare the health and behaviour of the horses under different circumstances. For example, hoof diseases and hay allergies are more common in Koniks raised in barns than in reserves.

In Poland, Koniks currently live on nature reserves at Popielno, Roztocze National Park, Stobnica Research Station of the University of Life Sciences in Poznań. They are bred in controlled conditions at a state stud at Popielno, Sieraków. Private breeders currently own 310 mares and 90 stallions; the state studs own 120 mares and 50 stallions.

=== Oostvaardersplassen, the Netherlands ===
As it is claimed to phenotypically resemble the extinct tarpan, the Konik has also been introduced into nature reserves in other nations. The Netherlands has multiple natural reserves spread over the country with (semi-)feral Konik horses. One of the first places were the Konik horse was introduced was the Oostvaardersplassen reserve, where the biggest herd of free-ranging feral Konik horses lives in the world. In 1983, 20 Konik horses were introduced in the reserve, but due to the fact that the horses have no natural predator in the reserve, the population increased rapidly and at a faster rate than was expected. The horses in the reserve are feral and by Dutch law it is prohibited to feed them or to interfere in their population size. In 2011 the herd consisted of 1150 Konik horses and in November 2017 this number reduced to 1050 horses, while the area of the reserve is meant for a maximum population of approximately 300 horses in order for the natural reserve to provide the horses with enough food. This overpopulation and harsh winters led to the starvation and death of many horses in the reserve, with a peak of 30% of the population in the winter of 2012-2013. The Dutch citizens were outraged by the neglecting approach of Staatsbosbeheer, and a debate about possible alterations of the laws on interference with feral animal populations in Dutch reserves started. In 2019 a few hundred horses got transported to reserves in Spain and Belarus. However, the population still continues to increase and as of October 2020 the Oostvaardersplassen reserve was home to 540 Konik horses, while there are no other reserves left to transport the horses to. In order to control the population size, the Province of Flevoland is considering to administer anticonception to the Konik horses. Furthermore, around 200 Konik horses were brought to slaughter in 2021.

<text>Southeast Airlines was established in 1993 as Sun Jet International and was founded by Tom Kolfenbach.
It was a low fare public charter airline which operated scheduled passenger service in the United States, headquartered in Largo, Florida, flying to various vacation/leisure destinations using eight McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 and two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft. It abruptly ceased operations on November 30, 2004. The airline was featured on the reality TV series &quot;The Simple Life&quot;, which Southeast executives hoped would give the carrier some exposure. The airline&#x27;s jets featured the &quot;Sun King&quot; logo previously used by the original National Airlines which appeared on the tails of its aircraft.

The Southeast Airlines name was also used by another U.S. air carrier that was based in Miami (MIA) using the two letter &quot;NS&quot; airline code which in 1966 was operating scheduled nonstop passenger service between Miami and Key West with Fairchild F-27 turboprop aircraft. During the late 1970s, this version of Southeast was operating scheduled passenger service with Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop aircraft between Miami and several destinations in the Turks and Caicos Islands including Grand Turk, Providenciales and South Caicos, and by 1979 was operating scheduled passenger service with a Boeing 720 jetliner nonstop between Miami and Aguadilla, Puerto Rico as well as with Fairchild F-27 turboprop aircraft nonstop between Miami and Tampa. This version of Southeast ceased operations during the early 1980s and also operated several Boeing 707 jetliners as well as a Boeing 727-100 cargo freighter jet during its existence.

<text>Kathak is one of the nine major forms of Indian classical dance. Its origin is attributed to the traveling bards in ancient northern India known as &quot;Kathakar&quot; (&quot;storyteller&quot;), who communicated stories from the Hindu epics through dance, songs and music. Its name derives from the Sanskrit word &quot;katha&quot; which means &quot;story&quot;, and &quot;kathakar&quot; which means &quot;the one who tells a story&quot;, or &quot;to do with stories&quot;. &#x27;Katha kahe so kathak kahave&#x27;- Kathak is the dance of story tellers. Stories narrated through the medium of the body, face, hands, feet in sync with the tabla and lehra.

&quot;Kathak&quot; dancers tell various stories utilizing hand movements and extensive footwork, their body movements and flexibility as well as their facial expressions. &quot;Kathak&quot; often has a strong beat and can be danced in many taals. While proto-Kathak elements can be seen long before, &quot;Kathak&quot; evolved during the Bhakti movement, particularly by incorporating the childhood and stories of the Hindu deity Krishna, as well as independently in the courts of north Indian kingdoms. During the period of Mughal rule, the emperors were patrons of &quot;Kathak&quot; dance and actively promoted it in their royal courts. &quot;Kathak&quot; performances include Urdu &quot;ghazal&quot; and commonly used instruments brought during the Mughal period. As a result, it is the only Indian classical dance form to feature Persian elements.

&quot;Kathak&quot; is found in three distinct forms, called &quot;gharana&quot;, named after the cities where the &quot;Kathak&quot; dance tradition evolved – Jaipur, Banares and Lucknow. While the Jaipur &quot;gharana&quot; focuses more on the foot movements, the Banaras and Lucknow &quot;gharana&quot; focus more on facial expressions and graceful hand movements. Stylistically, the &quot;Kathak&quot; dance form emphasizes rhythmic foot movements, adorned with small bells (&quot;Ghungroo&quot;) and the movement harmonized to the music. The legs and torso are generally straight, and the story is told through a developed vocabulary based on the gestures of arms and upper body movement, facial expressions, neck movements, eyes and eyebrow movement, stage movements, bends and turns. The main focus of the dance becomes the eyes and the foot movements. The eyes work as a medium of communication of the story the dancer is trying to communicate. With the eyebrows the dancer gives various facial expressions. The difference between the sub-traditions is the relative emphasis between acting versus footwork, with Lucknow style emphasizing acting and Jaipur style famed for its spectacular footwork.

&quot;Kathak&quot; is a performance art that has survived and thrived as an oral tradition, innovated and taught from one generation to another verbally and through practice. It transitioned, adapted, and integrated the tastes of the Mughal courts in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly by Akbar, but stagnated and went into decline during the British colonial era, then was reborn as India gained independence and sought to rediscover its ancient roots and a sense of national identity through the arts.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The term &quot;Kathak&quot; is rooted in the Vedic term &quot;Katha&quot; () which means &quot;story, conversation, traditional tale&quot;. &quot;Kathak&quot; refers to one of the major classical dance forms primarily found in northern India, with a historical influence similar to Bharatanatyam in south India, Odissi in east India and other major classical dances found in South Asia. It differs from the numerous folk dance forms found in the north and other parts of the Indian subcontinent.

The &quot;Kathak&quot; dancers, in the ancient India, were traveling bards and were known as &quot;Kathakas&quot;, or &quot;Kathakar&quot;.

&quot;Kathak&quot; has inspired simplified regional variants, such as the &quot;Bhavai&quot; – a form of rural theatre focussing on the tales of Hindu goddesses (Shakti), and one which emerged in the medieval era, is presently found in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Another variant that emerged from ancient &quot;Kathak&quot; is &quot;Thumri&quot;.

Thumri was developed by the tawaif community who were called &quot;nautch&quot; dancers by the British.  Their history as &quot;Kathak&quot; dancers have been erased in modern India &quot;&quot;.&quot;&quot;, also see &quot;&quot; 

== History ==

According to Mary Snodgrass, the Kathak tradition of India is traceable to 400 BCE. The earliest surviving text with Kathak roots is the Natya Shastra, attributed to sage Bharata. Its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE.

The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters. The text states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures – all of which are part of Indian classical dances including Kathak. Dance and performance arts, states this ancient Hindu text, are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues and the essence of scriptures.

The 2nd century BC panels found in Bharhut show the dancers in a vertical stance with their arms&#x27; positions already suggesting today&#x27;s Kathak movements. Most of the dancers have one arm near the ear in a &quot;pataka hasta&quot; (Mudra). In subsequent years, the hasta was lowered to the bust level.

The term Kathakas in the sense of &quot;storytellers&quot; appears in ancient Hindu texts, such as the Mahabharata:

Bards, actors, dancers, songsters and musical reciters of legends and stories are mentioned hundreds of times in the Hindu Epics.

===Bhakti movement era===
Textual studies suggest that &quot;Kathak&quot; as a classical dance form likely started in Banares (Varanasi) and from there migrated northwest to Lucknow, Jaipur and other parts of north and northwest India. The Lucknow tradition of Kathak dance attributes the style to a Bhakti movement devotee named Ishwari from the Handia village in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, who credited Hindu God Krishna appearing in his dream and asking him to develop &quot;dance as a form of worship&quot;. Ishwari taught his descendants, who in turn preserved the learning and developments through an oral tradition over six generations ultimately yielding the Lucknow version of the Kathak dance – a family tree that is acknowledged in both Hindu and Muslim music-related Indian literature.
The evolution in Kathak dance theme during the Bhakti movement centered primarily around divine Krishna, his lover Radha and milkmaids (&quot;gopis&quot;) – around legends and texts such as the Bhagavata Purana found in the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism. The love between Radha and Krishna became symbolism for the love between Atman (soul within) and the supreme source (Cosmic soul everywhere), a theme that dance ballet and mimetic plays of Kathak artists expressed. Although central Asian influence of Kathak rapid whirls has been proposed, Sangitaratnakara, a 13th-century Sanskrit text on Indian classical music and dance in Chapter 4 mentions a dance movement with rapid whirling around like a wheel keeping the arms in the Dola pose and bending the body inwards called &#x27;Cakramandala&#x27; It is employed in worshipping gods and in vigorous movement.

The emergence of Raslila, mainly in the Braj region (Mathura in Western U.P.) was an important development. It combined in itself music, dance, and the narrative. Dance in Raslila, however, was mainly an extension of the basic mime and gestures of the Kathakars or story-tellers which blended easily with the existing traditional dance.

===Mughal era===
With the coming of the Mughals, this dance form received a new impetus. A transition from the temple courtyard to the palace durbar took place which necessitated changes in presentation. In both Hindu and Muslim courts, Kathak became highly stylized and came to be regarded as a sophisticated form of entertainment. Under the Muslims, there was a greater stress on nritya and bhavag - the dance&#x27;s graceful, expressive and sensuous dimensions.

The Mughal era courts and nobles accepted Kathak as a form of aristocratic entertainment, which low income families were willing to provide. According to Drid Williams:

 Over time, the Kathak repertoire added Persian and Central Asian themes, such as the whirling of Sufi dance, the dress replaced &quot;sari&quot; with items that bared midriff and included a transparent veil of the type common with medieval Harem dancers. When the colonial European officials began arriving in India, the Kathak court entertainment they witnessed was a synthesis of the ancient Indian tradition and Central Asian-Persian dance form, and the Kathak dance performers were called the &quot;nautch girls&quot; (or &quot;natch&quot;, a derivative of the more difficult to pronounce Sanskrit &quot;natya&quot;).

===British Raj era===
With the expansion of British colonial rule in 19th-century India, Kathak along with all other classical dance forms were discouraged and it went into decline. This was in part the result of the Victorian morality of sexual repressiveness along with Anglican missionaries who criticized Hinduism. Reverend James Long, for example, proposed that Kathak dancers should forget ancient Indian tales and Hindu legends, and substitute them with European legends and Christian tales. Missionaries recorded their frustration in &quot;Church Missionary Review&quot; when they saw Hindu audiences applaud and shout &quot;Ram, Ram&quot; during Kathak performances.

The seductive gestures and facial expressions during Kathak performances in Temples and family occasions were caricatured in &quot;The Wrongs of Indian Womanhood&quot;, published at the start of the 20th century, as evidence of &quot;harlots, debased erotic culture, slavery to idols and priests&quot; tradition, and Christian missionaries demanded that this must be stopped, launching the &quot;anti-dance movement&quot; or &quot;anti-nautch movement&quot; in 1892. Officials and newspapers dehumanized the Kathak dancers and the sources of patronage were pressured to stop supporting the Kathak performing &quot;nautch girls&quot; (also termed as &quot;devadasis&quot; and &quot;tawa&#x27;ifs&quot; in mid 20th century literature). Many accused the dance form as a front for prostitution, while revivalists questioned the constructed histories by the colonial writers.

Not only did missionaries and colonial officials ridicule the Kathak dancers, Indian men who had been educated in British institution and had adapted to Victorian prudery joined the criticism, states Margaret Walker, possibly because they had lost their cultural connection, no longer understood the underlying spiritual themes behind the dance, and assumed this was one of the &quot;social ills, immoral and backward elements&quot; in their heritage that they must stamp out. However, the Hindu families continued their private tutoring and kept the Kathak art alive as an oral tradition. Kathak teachers also shifted to training boys to preserve the tradition, as most of the 20th-century ridicule had been directed at Kathak &quot;nautch girls&quot;.

Kathak was brought to the attention of audiences outside India in the early 20th century through Kalkaprasad Maharaj.

===Post-independence era===
The movement to end the colonial era and for an independent India, states Walker, also witnessed a revival of Kathak and more broadly, a cultural ferment and effort to reclaim culture and rediscover history. The Kathak revival movements co-developed in Hindu &quot;gharanas&quot;, particularly by the Kathak-Misra community. Of these the Jaipur and Lucknow sub-traditions of Kathak have attracted more scholarship.

The oldest Kathak department pat a degree college (university) was formed in 1956 at Indira Kala Sangeet University, a public university located in Khairagarh where Puru Dadheech instated the first Kathak syllabus for degree programs. It was inspired by the diploma syllabus of Mohanrao Kallianpurkar at Bhatkhande College.

According to a BBC Arts article, Kathak is unique in being practiced by the Muslim community of the India, and thus has a &quot;historical link to Islam.&quot; Farah Yasmeen Shaikh, a Muslim and a disciple of Pandit Chitresh Das in the Lucknow school, considers Kathak as a &quot;confluence of Hindu and Muslim cultures&quot;, and has presented her performance in Pakistan. In contrast, states BBC, Nahid Siddiqui (a legendary Kathak dancer from Pakistan, settled and nurtured in the UK), has a hard time practising and presenting her [Kathak] art in her birth-country of Pakistan&quot;.

While most scholars consider Kathak as an ancient art, some such as Margaret Walker suggest the modern Kathak is a 20th-century phenomenon, more a form of cultural revival, if one relies on the music-related Indian documents.

==Repertoire==

A modern Kathak, in all three major sub-traditions called Lucknow, Banares and Jaipur styles (&quot;gharana&quot;), states Bruno Nettl, consist of three main sections - the invocation, one pure (abstract) dance recital and one expressive dance.

The invocation (&quot;vandana&quot;) consists of the dancer coming to stage and offering respect to his or her guru and the musicians on the stage. If the team is from the Hindu tradition, the dancer(s) combine facial expressions and hand gestures (&quot;mudra&quot;) to invoke Hindu gods and goddesses; while a Muslim performance replace the devotional expressions with a &quot;salami&quot; (salutation).

The pure dance is called a &quot;nritta&quot;, while the expressive dance is called a &quot;nritya&quot;. A Kathak performance can be solo, duo or team. In a technical performance, the speed and energy the dancers exchange with the audience increases in multiples, that is the tempo doubles or quadruples. During the performance, one or more of the Kathak artists may come to the microphone, interact with the audience, explain something, tell an anecdote in a particular language, or rhythmically recite a song.

The dresses of the dancer and the facial cosmetics between a Hindu or Muslim Kathak dance troupe varies. The stage typically is bare with no distracting background, states Williams, with musicians seated on rugs downstage right (audience&#x27;s left), and if it is a Hindu performance there is an image of dancing Shiva (Nataraja) or a Ganesha on the stage&#x27;s left with flowers and perfumed incense burning.

===Pure dance (&quot;Nritta&quot;)===
The &quot;nritta&quot; performance starts off with a &quot;thàth&quot; sequence, which is a slower graceful movement of wrists, neck and eyebrows. Thereafter, the dancer gradually increases speed and energy, while completing a sequence of &quot;bol&quot; (mnemonic syllables in Indian tradition). Each &quot;bol&quot; has short sections, similar to technical exercises in western dance traditions, wherein the dancer engages the audience with &quot;tora&quot;, &quot;tukra&quot;, &quot;parhant&quot;, &quot;paran&quot; and others stressing footwork, gestures and turns. Each section when completed has a punctuation mark, usually a sharp turn of the head. Each ankle is adorned with small bells (&quot;ghungroo&quot;), which may have just one bell or hundreds. The dancer&#x27;s rapid movements and footwork in a &quot;nritta&quot; is perfectly timed to the musical beats (&quot;tala&quot;) and tempos, and the footwork sequences are called &quot;tatkars&quot;.

Most of the &quot;Nritta&quot; performance is abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of Kathak. In a Kathak &quot;nritta&quot;, as with all classical Indian dance forms, the viewer is presented with pure movement, wherein the emphasis is the beauty in motion, form, speed, range and pattern. It aims to engage the senses (prakriti) of the audience.

===Expressive dance (&quot;Nritya&quot;)===

&quot;Nritya&quot; is slower and expressive aspect of Kathak that attempts to communicate feelings, storyline particularly with spiritual themes in Hindu dance traditions. In a &quot;nritya&quot;, the dance expands to include words, musical notes and gestures to articulate a legend or message, it is more than sensory enjoyment, it aims to engage the emotions and mind of the viewer.

The expressiveness of Kathak is also found in other classical dances of India. Its roots are found in the &quot;Natyashastra&quot; text which defines drama in verse 6.10 as that which aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor&#x27;s art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a super sensual inner state of being. The &quot;Natya&quot; connects through &quot;abhinaya&quot; (literally, &quot;carrying to the spectators&quot;), that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein asserts &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, the actors communicate to the audience, through song and music. Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art to engage every aspect of life, in order to glorify and gift a state of joyful consciousness. According to Massey, another important ancient text that has influenced Kathak is the &quot;Abhinaya Darpanam&quot; of Nandikeshvara (~2nd century CE).

In Kathak, &quot;abhinaya&quot; is in the form of expressive gestures and pantomime set to music that usually outline a legend or the plot of a well known story. The gestures and facial expressions convey the &quot;ras&quot; (sentiment, emotional taste) and &quot;bhava&quot; (mood) of the underlying story. In the Hindu texts on dance, the guru and the artists successfully express the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance: &quot;Angik&quot; (gestures and body language), &quot;Vachik&quot; (song, recitation, music and rhythm), &quot;Aharya&quot; (dress, make-up, jewelry), and &quot;Satvik&quot; (artist&#x27;s mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist&#x27;s inner and outer state resonates). A Kathak nritya performance, however grants flexibility to the artists and invites improvisation, and it may not be accompanied with a song or recital about the legend. The stories in Kathak performance generally tend to be about the Hindu god Krishna (or in some cases Shiva or Devi), and the stories come from sources such as the Bhagavata Purana, or the Indian Epics. This form of expressiveness is also found in &quot;thumri&quot; and Persian &quot;ghazals&quot;.

===Dresses===

The dresses vary among &quot;Kathak&quot; performers, and find their sources in either Hindu or Muslim culture.

The Hindu dress for female dancers has two variations.One is based on a Sari, but is worn in a style different from the customary style that goes over the left shoulder. A Kathak artist generally wraps the sari around the waist and it hangs down from the left. A blouse called &quot;choli&quot; covers the upper body. The artist may wear a scarf (called &quot;orhni&quot; in some places). Hair, face, ear, neck, hand, wrist and ankle jewellery, typically of gold, may adorn the artist. A &quot;tika&quot; or &quot;bindi&quot; in the middle of forehead is common. The second variation of a Hindu Kathak dancer uses a long, full (just above the ankle), light-weight skirt usually with embroidered border that helps highlight the dance motion. The skirt is contrasted with a different color &quot;choli&quot;, and a transparent scarf typically drapes over it and the dancer&#x27;s head. Jewelry is typically present in the second variation.

The Muslim dress for female dancers also uses a skirt, but includes close fitting churidar pyjamas and sometimes a long coat covering hands and the upper body. The head has a cover scarf and the jewelry is light.

The Hindu dress for male Kathak performers is typically a silk &quot;dhoti&quot; draped around the waist, and covered with a silk scarf tied over the top. The upper body is usually left bare or with only the Hindu thread, but is sometimes covered with a loose sleeveless jacket. Kathak male artists also wear jewelry, but often of stones and much simpler than the female artists.
The Mughal dress for male Kathak performers is kurta-churidar. The kurta can be a simple one, or cut as an angarkha. There is also the possibility of adapting the angarkha or kurta for dance to incorporate wider flare in the lower portion. Particularly older variety dress include the small peaked cap too.

==Instruments==
The ensemble of musical instruments vary with any Kathak performer, ranging from two to twelve classical Indian instruments or more in versions with synthetic innovations. The most common instruments that go with Kathak are &quot;tabla&quot; (a pair of hand drums) that syncs with the dancer&#x27;s feet rhythms, &quot;sarangi&quot; or harmonium with &quot;manjira&quot; (hand cymbals) that meters the &quot;tal&quot; (cycle), and other instruments to add effect, depth and structure to the expressive stage of a Kathak performance.

==Music==
The ancient music genre of India, Dhrupad, was re-introduced into Kathak for the first time by India&#x27;s senior Kathak exponent Mahamahopadhyay Dr. Pandit Puru Dadheech. He is India&#x27;s first Kathak dancer to bring back &#x27;Dhrupad&#x27; on the formal Kathak stage and this composition in 28 matra. Shankar Pralayankar, his Dhrupad composition, has the unique status of regularly being sung in concerts by &#x27;Dhrupad&#x27; maestros the Gundecha Brothers.

==Gharanas==
Kathak is a diffuse tradition, of which three &quot;gharanas&quot; (schools) are more well known and studied – Jaipur, Banares and Lucknow. The schools place different relative emphasis between aspects of a Kathak performance such as the acting versus footwork. The Lucknow style, for example, emphasizes acting while Jaipur style emphasizes the dance and footwork. Traditionally, the Jaipur gharana has had a strong spiritual flavor, covering a diverse range of ideas in Vaishnavism and Shaivism.
The Jaipur gharana traces its origins to Bhanuji, a famed Shiva Tandava dancer who upon visiting Vrindavan was inspired and taught Natvari Nritya. Bhanuji&#x27;s grandons Laluji and Kanhuji were similarly inspired by Krishna. They returned to Jaipur, and together they began the Jaipur gharana of Kathak. The Jaipur style developed under the sponsorship of Rajput rulers, and they favored the Kathak dance with Hindu religious themes. In the modern era, this school has continued their emphasis on dance and footwork with Jai Lal, Janki Prasad, Kundan Lal, Mohan Lal and Nawal Kishore. This school is best known for its systematic innovations in rhythmic dancing, and the use of dance movement to express a story. 

The Lucknow gharana of Kathak dance attributes its origins to a rural Krishna devotee named Ishwari from the village in southeast Uttar Pradesh, who aimed to develop Kathak dance as a form of loving devotion to Krishna. This school thrived after the Mughal Empire collapsed, when Kathak artists moved from Delhi to Lucknow under the sponsorship of Avadh nawabs who favored court dance culture. In the modern era, the Lucknow gharana style influences the dance school in New Delhi with Shambu Maharaj, Birju Maharaj and Lacchu Maharaj. Kathak choreography there has developed themes beyond Krishna-Radha, such as those based on the drama works of Kalidasa&#x27;s Shiva-Parvati and Bhavabhuti&#x27;s Malati-Madhav. This school has also attempted a Hindu-Muslim Kathak fusion style, highlighting the court dancers theme.

The Banares gharana is the third major style, traditionally believed to be the oldest. Its history is unclear. According to Kothari, the school started with Janakiprasad from a village near Bikaner who resettled in Varanasi, but one whose ancestors were famed dancers and musicians. Janakiprasad was a dancer and a Sanskrit scholar, and credited with inventing the &quot;bols&quot; of Kathak, which are mnemonic syllables within the language of this classical dance of India.

According to Nicole Lehmann, modern Kathak dancers show, to varying degrees, a fusion of the styles from all three gharanas.

==Relationship with other art forms==
The north Indian &quot;Kathak&quot; dance differs from the south Indian &quot;Bharatanatyam&quot; in several ways, even though both have roots in the Hindu text &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;. Kathak expressions – particularly in Hindu devotional styles – are more introverted and withdrawn, while &quot;Bharatanatyam&quot; is more extroverted and expansive. &quot;Kathak&quot; is normally performed in a standing form with legs and torso typically straight, while &quot;Bharatanatyam&quot; extensively utilizes bent knee form (&quot;ara mandi&quot;, half sitting position that is somewhat similar to &quot;Demi Plié&quot; ballet move).

&quot;Kathak&quot; is also different from &quot;Kathakali&quot;, though both are Indian classical dance traditions of &quot;story play&quot; wherein the stories have been traditionally derived from the Hindu epics and the Puranas. Kathakali emerged in the southwestern region of India (modern Kerala), and is distinctive in its elaborate codified colorful makeup, masks and dress. Kathakali traditionally has been troupes of predominantly male actor-dancers, who dress up as hero, heroines, gods, goddesses, demons, demonesses, priests, animals and daily life characters. Both dance forms employ elaborate footwork, choreography and hand gestures, but &quot;Kathakali&quot; integrates south Indian martial arts movements such as leaps and jumps. Both dance forms trace their roots to classical Sanskrit texts, but &quot;Kathakali&quot; has relatively more recent origins, more closely follows the &quot;Hastha Lakshanadeepika&quot; text and began flourishing in the 16th century. While each has a different musical and dance language, both deploy a host of similar traditional Indian musical instruments.

According to Miriam Phillips, the Indian Kathak and the Spanish Flamenco dance share many visual, rhythmic and kinesthetic similarities.

<doc id="480525" wikidata="Q2464947" url="?curid=480525" title="Lehi (prophet)">
<text>According to the Book of Mormon, Lehi ( ) was a prophet who lived in Jerusalem during the reign of King Zedekiah (approximately 600 BC). In First Nephi, Lehi is rejected for preaching repentance and he leads his family, including Sariah, Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi, into the wilderness. He sends his sons back to recover the plates of brass and once more for the family of Ishmael. As they travel, Lehi has a vision of the tree of life in which most of his family, excepting Laman and Lemuel, accepts God. He also prophesies Christ&#x27;s coming 600 years in the future.

Lehi has two sons in the wilderness before they arrive at the ocean, where Nephi is directed to build a boat. They cross the sea, and Lehi and Sariah become sick because of Laman and Lemuel&#x27;s rebellion. Before he dies, Lehi blesses his sons and their families.

Lehi likely had daughters in addition to his named sons and has been compared to Moses both in his calling as a prophet and leadership of an exodus. He may have made two different kinds of sacrifices, namely peace offerings and burnt offerings, based on the Book of Mormon text and Old Testament descriptions. It is noted that Lehi claimed the land his family landed on despite others already living there. Some religious scholars speculate, based on travel time, that Lehi and his family received assistance from nearby tribes as they travelled, possibly in return for work or even servitude. Others compare the pointed mentioning of Lehi&#x27;s tent to scriptural connections between tents and temples. Lehi&#x27;s record is claimed to have been contained in the lost 116 pages of the Book of Mormon translation. One phrase of his has been compared to a quote from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, with some suggesting Joseph Smith took it from the play and others suggesting a precedent of similar phrasing around Lehi&#x27;s time.

He is the namesake of the modern-day city of Lehi, Utah and has been depicted in many fiction and non-fiction books, movies, and works of art.

== Narration ==
In the Book of Mormon, Lehi is a descendant of Joseph of Egypt, husband of Sariah, and father of Laman, Lemuel, Sam, Nephi, Jacob, Joseph, and two or more daughters. He lives in Jerusalem around 600 years before the coming of Jesus Christ in a time when many prophets are preaching the city would be destroyed. After hearing this, he prays on behalf of the people and has a vision from God of the destruction of Jerusalem. Following this vision, he begins to preach to the people that they need to repent, but they try to kill him. The Lord commands Lehi to take his family and any supplies they need and leave everything else behind. He then builds an altar and offers burnt sacrifices in thanks to the Lord for saving his family. His sons Laman and Lemuel complain about leaving everything behind.

The Lord asks Lehi to send his sons back to Jerusalem for the plates of brass, which contain family records and other teachings, from Laban. His wife Sariah complains against him for sending them into danger, thinking they might be dead. When they return safely, Lehi reads through the plates, discovers he is descended from Joseph of Egypt, and teaches his sons more of what he learns from the records.

Lehi sends his sons back to Jerusalem again to gather the family of Ishmael to travel with them. Sometime after their return, he has a dream with a vision of a tree of life in which Sariah, Sam, and Nephi eat of the fruit representing God&#x27;s love and Laman and Lemuel choose not to. Upon waking, he shares the dream with his family and, worrying about Laman and Lemuel, he teaches them they need to be more faithful. In another vision, he predicts the Messiah will come within 600 years.

One morning, he finds a compass outside of his tent which guides his family in their travels. They continue traveling and come to a land they name Bountiful. While camping in Bountiful, Nephi&#x27;s bow breaks and they suffer from food shortage. Lehi begins to complain alongside Laman, Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, but Nephi speaks to them and the Lord &quot;chastens&quot; Lehi. After he repents, Lehi asks the Lord where to find food and is able to direct Nephi on where to go with his new bow. As the group continues and arrives at the ocean, it is revealed that Lehi has had two more sons in the wilderness, Jacob and Joseph. The family is guided across the ocean, but Laman and Lemuel&#x27;s rebellious actions along the way cause Lehi and Sariah so much grief that they become sick and close to death.

Lehi has another vision after arriving in the Promised Land that Jerusalem has been destroyed. He shares that the land they have been guided to is promised to his descendants as an inheritance as long as they follow God&#x27;s commandments. Before his death, he blesses his sons and their families. He also quotes from a prophecy in the brass plates, saying that there will be a seer in the future who was a descendant of Joseph of Egypt and Lehi&#x27;s son Joseph, and whose father would be named Joseph. After blessing his family, Lehi grows old and dies.

Lehi&#x27;s prophesies include the destruction of Jerusalem, Babylonian captivity, the Jews returning to Jerusalem, the teachings of John the Baptist, the coming of Christ, Christ&#x27;s resurrection, and the gathering of Israel.

==Family relationships==
Lehi&#x27;s known immediate family according to the Book of Mormon is as shown in the diagram below.



=== Daughters ===
Lehi&#x27;s son, Nephi, mentions having sisters in his writings, although their names and birth order are unknown. The &quot;Encyclopedia of the Book of Mormon&quot; suggests Lehi had these daughters after leaving Jerusalem. Latter-day Saint Book of Mormon scholars and apologists Hugh Nibley and Sidney B. Sperry propose that the wives of the two married sons of Ishmael may have been Lehi&#x27;s daughters as it was customary at the time for daughters to marry their father&#x27;s brother&#x27;s sons.

=== Laman and Lemuel ===
Laman and Lemuel are often spoken of in negative terms such as when Lehi urges them to improve and be firm and continuously righteous as the river and the valley in which they are camping. In &quot;The Book of Mormon For the Least of These&quot;, a Book of Mormon commentary, Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Hemming suggest that rather than a scolding, this encouragement should be viewed as Lehi having sustained love and hope for his children. Writing in 1969 for &quot;&quot;, Robert E. Nichols attributes Laman and Lemuel&#x27;s confession that they cannot understand Lehi&#x27;s words to Lehi&#x27;s metaphorical language.

== Interpretation ==
=== Lehi&#x27;s exodus ===
Nephi has been brought up as a Moses figure in the past, says BYU professor and past director of FARMS Noel B. Reynolds, but Lehi may have set that example as well. In an analysis of Lehi&#x27;s final words to his family, Reynolds suggests fourteen different connections to Moses. There were often issues with people in Lehi&#x27;s group failing to acknowledge him as a prophet. As his children knew and understood Moses as a prophet and leader of the exodus from Egypt, Lehi may have used comparisons to Moses to help them understand the significance of the Lord&#x27;s guidance of their family and the commandments he asked them to follow. Lehi&#x27;s exodus from Jerusalem has been compared to that of Moses, and additionally sets a precedent for the exodus of later groups in the Book of Mormon. Lehi was called just as Moses was when he prayed to the Lord for his people. Both Lehi and Moses left with their people and led them into the desert through times of difficulty and rebellion. In different occasions, both groups tried to kill their leader. They received commandments, were directed by God, and were led to a promised land.

Scholars S. Kent Brown, Terrence l. Szink, and Bruce J. Boehm add that as 1 Nephi was written a number of years after it happened, Nephi may have noticed similarities between the Israelite exodus and Lehi&#x27;s leadership of their own journey and reflected that realization as he wrote his history.

=== Religious sacrifices ===
Multiple offerings are mentioned in Lehi&#x27;s appearance in the Book of Mormon and S. Kent Brown suggests these were sacrifices of thanksgiving as well as burnt offerings for sin. Both times Lehi&#x27;s sons returned from Jerusalem, joy and thanks are described, which lines up with descriptions the sacrifices of thanksgiving described in Psalm 107, says Brown. Sacrifices of thanksgiving are alternately translated as peace offerings, which were connected with the idea of well-being and therefore with safe travels. Such offerings were common and often involved a meal, the sacrifice itself being an animal and unleavened bread. Brown suggests Lehi and his family may have traded with local tribes for animals to sacrifice. Additionally, just as priests in Jerusalem offered daily burnt sacrifices in the likelihood that someone somewhere had sinned that day, Lehi&#x27;s burnt sacrifices would have been to cover the sins of his family.

=== Land inheritance ===

Salleh and Hemming also touch on Lehi&#x27;s mindset of inheriting the Americas as the Promised Land. They point out that there are already people living on the continent when Lehi and his family arrive, and how Lehi talks about having possession of the land as a right. This may be notable in the context that Lehi has been traveling for years without land of his own.

=== Bondage in the wilderness ===
BYU professor of ancient scripture S. Kent Brown explains that in Lehi&#x27;s time, a large caravan could travel from the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean in a span of weeks rather than years. The full journey is said to have taken about eight years, and Brown suggests the activities and traveling from Jerusalem to the first camp and on to Nahom lasted less than a year. This time gap presents, according the Brown, a missing part of the narration. Based on the resources they brought with them and the fact that they ran out of food multiple times on the way, Lehi and his family may have turned to a tribe in the area for help in exchange for work. It is noted that in the Bible, &quot;to sojourn&quot; is linked to servitude or living under the protection of another.

=== Lehi&#x27;s record and the 116 pages ===
Nephi begins his record claiming he&#x27;s making an abridgement of his father&#x27;s writings. Latter-day Saint founder and prophet Joseph Smith claimed that the first 116 translated pages of the Book of Mormon which were lost included the Book of Lehi.

=== &quot;The cold and silent grave&quot; ===
Latter-day Saint apologist Hugh Nibley writes of the oft-compared phrasing from 2 Nephi 1:14 with a quote from &quot;Hamlet&quot;. 

Alexander Campbell of the &quot;Millennial Harbinger&quot; proposes that the words were copied from Shakespeare. Nibley alternatively suggests that although the wording is similar, there are other examples of similar usage around Lehi&#x27;s time period. Independent scholar Robert F. Smith, who studies Near Eastern languages, cites specific linguistic connections to the verse from outside sources of ancient times and other similarities specifically within the Bible.

==Modern commemorations==
Lehi, Arizona and Lehi, Utah were named after him by Latter-day Saint settlers.

== In art ==

The Book of Mormon Art Catalog records multiple depictions of Lehi in visual art. Lehi&#x27;s tree of life vision was among the first subjects of artwork of Book of Mormon content, and around 1874 David Hyrum Smith, a son of Joseph Smith and a leader in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (later renamed to Community of Christ), produced &quot;Lehi&#x27;s Dream&quot;, portraying Lehi being led to the tree of life by an angel. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&#x27; first visual artwork of Lehi&#x27;s dream was produced in about 1949–1951 by American painter Minerva Teichert; her &quot;The House of the World&quot; depicts Lehi beckoning his family, who clasp the iron rod, with Sariah in focus in the image&#x27;s center. After receiving a copy of the Book of Mormon and reading its stories, Polish Catholic artist Roman Śledź created several woodcarvings of Book of Mormon scenes, including &quot;Wizja Lehiego—Drzewo Życia&quot; depicting Lehi’s dream of the tree of life. From January to May 2024, the Harold B. Lee Library&#x27;s Reynolds Auditorium Gallery hosted an exhibition of artwork of Lehi&#x27;s vision of the tree of life. Depictions of Lehi&#x27;s tree of life vision account for 7% of all visual art of Book of Mormon content.

Danish-American painter C. C. A. Christensen&#x27;s 1890 &quot;Lehi Blessing His Posterity&quot; portrays Lehi with his family. American artist George M. Ottinger&#x27;s &quot;Arrival in the New World&quot;, also produced around 1890, is a scene of Lehi with Ishmael, Nephi, and family. Teichert&#x27;s &quot;Loading the Ship&quot;, created 1949–1951, shows a scene of Lehi&#x27;s family. In the twentieth century, American illustrator Arnold Friberg produced a series of 12 paintings depicting scenes from the Book of Mormon, including portrayals of Lehi such as in &quot;Lehi in the Wilderness Discovers the Liahona&quot; and &quot;Lehi and His People Arrive in the Promised Land&quot;. In an interview, Friberg said of his &quot;Lehi in the Wilderness&quot; that he envisioned Lehi as a &quot;wealthy man&quot; and intentionally portrayed him with &quot;rich clothing&quot;. In the same interview, Friberg pointed out that in his &quot;Lehi and His People Arrive&quot;, while most of the figures express excitement about arriving, Lehi visibly &quot;is looking heavenward in thanks&quot;.

<text>The dhoti is an ankle-length breechcloth, wrapped around the waist and the legs, in resemblance to the shape of trousers. The dhoti is a garment of ethnic wear for men in the Indian subcontinent. The &quot;dhoti&quot; is fashioned out of a rectangular piece of unstitched cloth, of usually around in length.
The &quot;dhoti&quot; is considered to be the male counterpart of the &quot;sari&quot;, worn by females to religious &amp; secular ceremonies (functions). A is a yellow silk dhoti worn on auspicious occasions. Dhotis must not be confused with &quot;readymade panchakachams&quot; or &quot;dhoti pants&quot;, which are a new ready to wear trend, popular among women and typical of children. Although the terms &quot;mundu&quot; or &quot;veshti&quot; are used interchangeably with &quot;dhoti&quot;, they are different from the dhoti, which is &quot;looped&quot; or wrapped around the legs, in the form of trousers or pants. The dhoti is better known as panchakacham in South India, which may even be worn while doing dances such as moonwalks. While the sari is still draped by many women as daily wear, only a few men know how to wrap the dhoti &amp; use it everyday. The dhoti has been displaced by the &quot;English clothes&quot; of the British, in urban areas like Bombay (Mumbai). Men in dhotis are looked down upon, because they are perceived as poor, at some places such as shopping malls.

==Etymology and history==
The unstitched dhoti is also referred to as &quot;dhautra&quot; (IPA: /dʱɑwtɽɐ/) in Sanskrit, which means rope or cord. It evolved from the ancient &quot;antriya&quot;, which was passed in between the legs, tucked at the back and covered the legs loosely, then flowed into long pleats at front of the legs, the same way it is worn today as formal dhoti. While a casual and short dhoti wraps around both legs firmly, in this style the back side of the dhoti is pulled to the front and tucked at the waist, before tucking the two loose ends at back, creating firmly fitted trouser-like dhoti that wraps around both legs. This style is more commonly worn by farmers and martial artists. Stitched garments became popular in
the Indian subcontinent, with the coming of Persians, Greeks &amp; &quot;barbarians&quot;; nonetheless the dhoti prevailed in &quot;sakaccha&quot; as well as &quot;vikaccha&quot; forms. In the Sunga period, there were two broad modes of wearing the dhoti, the &quot;sakaccha&quot; &amp; the &quot;vikaccha&quot;. In the &quot;sakaccha&quot; way, the cloth passed between the legs &amp; was tucked at the back; &quot;vikaccha&quot; meant wearing the dhoti in the form of a lungi. In the past, there were variations in the styles of wrapping the dhoti based on castes, as in the case of Bombay&#x27;s Sonars &amp; the Peshwa Brahmins; for this reason English attire has been described as &quot;caste neutral&quot;.

During British rule in colonial India, the dhoti remained a national symbol of resistance and cultural identity, when worn without a shirt. At the height of the Indian Independence Movement, weaving &quot;khadi&quot; was a symbol of the &quot;swadeshi movement&quot;. In 1921, the famed M K Gandhi himself championed only the &quot;dhoti&quot; often topless (without a kurta or shirt), to promote and identify with the handicrafts produced by the rural &amp; the poor of his homeland.

== Names and styles ==

The garment is known by various names based on language, such as:
== Custom and usage ==
The &quot;pancha&quot; is worn by many conservative Jain men when they visit &quot;derasars&quot; or &quot;basadi&quot;s for puja; unstitched clothing is believed by some Jains to be &quot;less permeable to pollution&quot; and therefore more appropriate for religious rituals than other garments. They also wear a loose and unstitched cloth, shorter than the &quot;pancha&quot; on top.
International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), known for its distinctive dress code, prompts Western adherents to wear &quot;pancha&quot;, usually of saffron or white cloth folded in ethnic Bengali style. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was known for wearing a white silk dhoti. Traditionally, men wear the dhoti topless (without upper garments), while entering certain &quot;mandirs&quot; (Hindu temples) in South India, because stitched garments supposedly counter the energy of the idol. The dhoti is often worn with a shirt in other places.

The &quot;dhoti&quot; has been ethnically worn by farmers, &quot;pehlwano&quot; (wrestlers) &amp; shepherds (grazers) of Sikhs in the Punjab region; it was discouraged during the Punjab Subah Movement, owing it to the inter-communal tensions prevalent at the time. The &quot;dhothi&quot; was also worn by South Canarese Christian men to their pre-nuptial ceremonies, church weddings &amp; receptions until the 1960s when they fell out of favour; since then grooms have been styling the black suit and tie instead.
There&#x27;s a distinction between the &quot;lungi&quot;, a similar garment often worn by people at their homes, &quot;lungi&quot; is more casual and comfortable, the dhoti however is considered formal, it is sometimes worn by politicians.

<text>The Numskulls is a comic strip in &quot;The Beano&quot;, and previously in &quot;The Beezer&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot; – UK comics owned by D.C Thomson. The strip is about a team of tiny human-like technicians who live inside the heads of various people, running and maintaining their bodies and minds. It first appeared in &quot;The Beezer&quot; from 1962 until 1979, drawn by Malcolm Judge. The Numskulls are still going and featured weekly in the popular British comic The Beano.

==History==
The strip first appeared in &quot;The Beezer&quot; in 1962 and was drawn by Malcolm Judge. In this version, they lived inside a man&#x27;s head rather than a boy&#x27;s head. The man was never named, but the Numskulls referred to him as &quot;our Man&quot;. There were six Numskulls during this time. The &#x27;Mouth Department&#x27; was home to two Numskulls, named Alf and Fred. Luggy (Radar) looked a lot like Cruncher, Snitch looked like Cruncher as well except Snitch wore orange, Brainy had no glasses and had no hair apart from around his ears and wore black, Blinky looked the same except he was bald and Alf and Fred had two hairs on their head and wore black and yellow.

Judge drew the strip until 1979, at which point Tom Lavery started drawing the strip. Judge returned as artist in 1984, and continued to draw it until his death in 1989. Following his death, John Dallas took over as artist. In 1990 the comic became The Beezer and Topper following the merge of The Topper and The Beezer. It was at this point that the man was replaced by a boy. In the Beezer and Topper, Dallas continued drawing the strip for a few months, before Steve Bright took over as artist for most of the comic&#x27;s remaining run. Three years later the comic folded, and the strip joined The Beano in issue 2674, dated 16 October 1993, drawn by Tom Paterson. It was at this point &quot;Our Boy&quot; Became Edd, and each numskull was given a new look. The strip in the 60th anniversary special was drawn by Trevor Metcalfe. Paterson continued drawing it until late 2000, as shortly afterwards he took over Minnie the Minx from the retired Jim Petrie. The strip was then drawn by Barry Glennard, who became the permanent artist in 2003, although Dave Eastbury drew some strips on occasion during 2002. Tom Paterson returned to contribute a number of strips in 2007–2009, as well as in the 2009 and 2011 Beano Annuals.

After &quot;Our Man&quot; became &quot;Edd&quot; and &quot;Luggy&quot; became &quot;Radar&quot; and &quot;Nosey&quot; became &quot;Snitch&quot;, Edd became aware of the Numskulls&#x27; existence inside him, after a doctor discovered them on his X-ray system. Despite the doctor&#x27;s alarm and decision that they had to be removed, Edd was very calm and wondered whether getting rid of them was a bad idea.

The Numskulls in this version are:
*Brainy – controls Edd&#x27;s brain. Brainy is the head of the Numskulls. 
*Blinky – controls his sight/eyes.
*Radar (originally called Luggy) – controls his hearing/ears.
*Snitch (originally called Nosey) – controls his smell/nose.
*Cruncher (originally two characters called Alf &amp; Fred) – controls his mouth/taste.

Occasionally other numskulls are seen who control Edd&#x27;s other body functions including germ fighting numskulls, numskulls in the stomach, pelvis numskulls and blood numskulls.

Some earlier strips had suggested that &quot;everyone&quot; had Numskulls. A &quot;Bananaman&quot; summer special, for instance featured an X-ray of Bananaman showing the &quot;Nanaskulls&quot;. Even animals and other Beano stars were revealed to have Numskulls, in fact, the centre story of the 2008 Annual was centred around Plug&#x27;s Plugskulls, reacting to true love. A rare trope in their strips would occur when the Numskulls of animals (such as dogs, rabbits and pigeons) would invade Edd, causing him to behave in the same characteristics as their animal hosts.

In December 2012, a new version of The Numskulls appeared in the new digital version of The Dandy. This version is about a younger boy called Alex Bonce, whose Numskulls are not stick figures, but instead are concepts popular with children – the brain is controlled by a space jackal starship captain, the nose by a masked wrestler, the eyes by a video game elf (a spoof of Link from &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;), the ears by a robot, and the mouth by a barbarian and a dinosaur. It was drawn by Jamie Smart.

In July 2013, the Beano version was revamped by Nigel Auchterlounie, who writes and draws a new version of the strip showing the Numskulls of celebrities, starting with Ant and Dec. As a result, Edd disappeared for a while, though he returned after a few months. The Numskulls remain the same though, although always looking different each week, they are still referred to as Brainy, Blinky, Radar, Snitch and Cruncher. In early 2014, Edd returned but it&#x27;s still drawn by Nigel Auchterlounie.

==Parodies==

The strip was parodied in the &quot;Viz&quot; comic strip &quot;Driving Mr Beckham&quot;, in which we are privy to the thought processes of David Beckham, in a style akin to the Numskulls.

<doc id="480539" wikidata="Q1770716" url="?curid=480539" title="Burgess Park">
<text>Burgess Park is a public park situated in Camberwell in the London Borough of Southwark. It is close to Walworth to the north, Bermondsey to the east and Peckham to the south. At , it is one of the largest parks in South London.

Unlike most other parks in London, Burgess Park was carved out of a highly built-up area of London. Virtually all the land now occupied by the park was previously used for housing, industry and transport infrastructure.

==Construction==
Houses were purchased and demolished to form the park. The idea for Burgess Park came out of the 1943 Abercrombie plan for open spaces in London, and the land has been gradually assembled and landscaped over the subsequent decades, first by the London County Council, then the Greater London Council and since the mid-1980s the London Borough of Southwark. The earliest component of what is now Burgess Park pre-dates the Abercrombie Plan: the King George&#x27;s Field, opened in 1938 on the site of a former baths and swimming pool, at the Addington Square end of the park.

The early stages of the expansion of the park led to the incorporation of the North Camberwell Open Space in 1965. The open space included the churchyard of St George&#x27;s, Camberwell, which had been designed by Francis Bedford in 1824. The churchyard had ceased to be used for burials in 1856. In 1886, it was acquired as a public open space by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association and laid out as a public garden with funds provided by Viscountess Ossington. Catherine Gladstone opened the garden in 1887. After the churchyard was incorporated into the North Camberwell Open Space, it was re-landscaped in 1966. However, the church closed in 1970 and was allowed to become derelict. When the church was adapted to private housing in 1994, most of the garden was allowed to become a private garden.

An important stage in the construction of the park was the closure of the Grand Surrey Canal in the early 1970s, which terminated at Addington Wharf on Camberwell Road. The canal served the Surrey Commercial Docks, and the area near Camberwell was full of 19th-century streets, houses and industrial buildings (including an R White&#x27;s ginger beer factory and the Watkins Bible Factory), many of which had suffered heavy bomb damage during WWII. The stretch of canal now incorporated in the park is the site of &quot;Camberwell Wharf&quot;, which was virtually straight. Other land incorporated in the park was occupied by housing.
Named Burgess Park in 1973 (after Councillor Jessie Burgess, Camberwell&#x27;s first female mayor), it is still incomplete and contains some former roads which have been stopped up but not yet grassed over. The boundaries of Burgess Park remain a matter of dispute, and because the park is unfinished, it is regularly the subject of proposals to build housing, schools or transport links of the sort that would never be contemplated in one of London&#x27;s older parks of Victorian origin.

==Features==

There are a large number of listed buildings in the Park, remnants of the streets which once occupied the site: an early 19th century lime kiln, the Passmore Edwards library, baths and wash houses (the piers and railings of which are separately listed) and the former almshouses in Chumleigh Gardens (which have three separate listings). The whole of the Passmore Edwards building was listed as an asset of community value in 2014. The adjacent former church of St George designed by Bedford, now converted into flats, is also listed; some parts of its former churchyard form part of the park. Its war memorial of Christ, head bowed, holding a crown of thorns, by the Danish artist Arild Rosenkrantz, is also listed.
The library, baths and wash houses are occupied by the Lynn AC boxing club and formerly by a theatre group Theatre Delicatessen. An external wall has a large mosaic of a Camberwell Beauty butterfly. The almshouses are occupied by offices and by a café. There are also several bridges, which once used to cross the canal.

Chumleigh Gardens, near the centre of the park, is a World Garden, with plants and landscaping designed to reflect the diversity of the surrounding population of this highly cosmopolitan portion of London. It was established in 1995, in the grounds of the former Female Friendly Society Asylum.

Recent additions to the park include &quot;Silent Raid&quot;, an art installation by Sally Hogarth commemorating Zeppelin raids on the local area in 1917 and a memorial to locally-born Jack Harvey VC.

There is a thriving Friends of Burgess Park who also have an online heritage project on the park, Bridge To Nowhere. In the past, the park has played host to many festivals, including, in August, the Carnaval Del Pueblo, Europe&#x27;s largest celebration of Latin American culture.

==Facilities==

In 2009, Burgess Park was one of 11 parks throughout Greater London chosen to receive money for redevelopment by a public vote. The park received a grant of £2 million from Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, as part of a London-wide competition, and the money was used to install better footpaths, additional lighting, refurbished public toilets and new play areas for children. Subsequent plans existed to top this up to £6 million by Southwark Council, to ensure the renovation of the space.

Peckham BMX Club are based in the park and has trained several world-class riders including Olympic medallist Kye Whyte.

Other facilities include tennis courts, football pitches, a rugby field (winter) / cricket oval (summer), a bbq area, a sports centre, a nursery, a community art project, Art in the Park, a local rugby club, Southwark Tigers, and two playgrounds. The park hosts a Saturday morning 5 km ParkRun.

<text>The thermal equator (also known as &quot;the heat equator&quot;) is a belt encircling Earth, defined by the set of locations having the highest mean annual temperature at each longitude around the globe. Because local temperatures are sensitive to the geography of a region, mountain ranges and ocean currents ensure that smooth temperature gradients (such as might be found if Earth were uniform in composition and devoid of surface irregularities) are impossible, the location of the thermal equator is not identical to that of the geographic Equator.

The term is less frequently used to describe the belt of maximum temperatures surrounding the globe which migrates roughly between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. This region is known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone. This zone is the result of trade winds from the northern and southern part of the hemisphere eventually joining together.

Still another definition states that the thermal equator is the latitude at which insolation is identical throughout the year. This is not the same as the astronomical equator because Earth reaches perihelion (the minimum distance from the Sun in its orbit) in early January and is at aphelion (maximum distance) in early July. Therefore, insolation is somewhat higher at 0° latitude in January than in July even though the height of the Sun (at noon) and the length of day (from sunrise to sunset) is essentially the same. At a few degrees north of the Equator, the perihelion/aphelion factor is balanced by the fact that the angle of the Sun is slightly more direct, and the days are slightly longer, at the time of the summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere (most commonly on June 21), making the level of insolation virtually the same in both &quot;summer&quot; and &quot;winter.&quot;

Chennai, India, at 13 degrees north, is considered to lie on the thermal equator at its longitude (80 degrees east).

<doc id="480544" wikidata="Q669318" url="?curid=480544" title="Nephi, son of Lehi">
<text>Nephi () is one of the central figures described in the Book of Mormon. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he is described as the son of Lehi, a prophet, and the founder of the Nephite people. The Book of Mormon also describes him as the author of its first two books, First and Second Nephi.

In the narrative, Nephi&#x27;s family flees Jerusalem as commanded by God but returns twice. The first time, Lehi&#x27;s sons return to retrieve the brass plates from a man named Laban. After two unsuccessful attempts to get the plates, Nephi, prompted by the Holy Spirit, kills Laban and receives the plates after disguising himself as Laban. The next time they return, the brothers convince Ishmael&#x27;s family to join them. Both times Nephi&#x27;s life is threatened by two of his older brothers, Laman and Lemuel.

After spending eight years in the wilderness, the family reaches the land Bountiful, where Nephi builds a ship under the direction of God. As the family voyages across the sea, Laman and Lemuel rebel, tying Nephi when he admonishes them about their behavior. A storm pushes them back on their journey, and eventually Laman and Lemuel untie him. Some time after their arrival in the Promised Land, Laman and Lemuel once again try to kill Nephi and he flees with several members of the family. Now safe, Nephi becomes a leader over his people and builds a prosperous community. Nephi is the subject of religious scholarship and various creative authorial works.

== Background and family ==
According to the Book of Mormon, Nephi is the fourth of six sons of Lehi and Sariah. Nephi and his family live in Jerusalem, circa 600 BC, during the reign of King Zedekiah, who is initiated as king under the direction of Nebuchadnezzar. They live there until Lehi is commanded by God to take his family and flee into the wilderness. Before their flight, Nephi&#x27;s father Lehi prophesies of the impending destruction and captivity of Jerusalem by the armies of Babylon, an event mentioned in the Bible several times.

=== Family tree ===

Nephi also mentions having sisters, though he does not give their names or birth orders. Little is known about Nephi&#x27;s children. Religious scholar Grant Hardy suggests that all of Nephi&#x27;s children may have been daughters at the time of passing on the record, or that his sons were influenced by Laman and Lemuel; his speculations are based on the fact that Nephi says he has children yet passes the record on to his brother Jacob.

== Narrative ==
In the narrative of the Book of Nephi, Nephi and his family leave Jerusalem around 600 B.C., travel to the Red Sea, and journey three days farther into the wilderness, stopping in a valley by a river near the Red Sea. Lehi then sends four sons (Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi) back to Jerusalem to get the brass plates. After successfully obtaining them, they are commanded to return to Jerusalem a second time to bring Ishmael&#x27;s family.

=== Returning to Jerusalem ===
A powerful man named Laban, who is a kinsman to Lehi, possesses the brass plates, a record kept by the Jews which contains their laws, customs, history, and lineage. Nephi and his brothers attempt three times to get them from Laban. First, they send Laman, whom Laban accuses of theft and sends servants to kill when he asks for the plates. Nephi convinces his brothers to try buying the plates using their abandoned wealth; Laban refuses the offer, though he keeps the goods, and sends his servants to kill them. After running away, the brothers hide in a cave, where Laman and Lemuel beat Nephi and Sam. An angel appears and stops them. Nephi returns a third time to make a final attempt to get the plates. When Nephi finds Laban drunk and passed out in the street, the Lord commands him to kill Laban—an idea Nephi struggles with. The Spirit tells him that it is better for &quot;one man to perish than for an entire nation to dwindle and perish in unbelief.&quot; Nephi follows through with the command and then dresses himself in Laban&#x27;s clothing and armor. He returns to Laban&#x27;s house and orders Zoram, one of Laban&#x27;s servants, to bring him the brass plates. When he leads Zoram back to his brothers, they think that Nephi is Laban and turn to flee; Nephi calls out to them. Realizing that Nephi is not Laban, Zoram turns to run, but Nephi stops him. He commands him to join them as an act of self-preservation, to which Zoram consents.

Sometime after they obtain the brass plates, the Lord tells Lehi to send his sons back to Jerusalem so they can convince Ishmael’s family to join them. This allows Lehi’s sons to marry, as Ishmael is father to five daughters. They succeed and return to the wilderness. During the journey, Laman and Lemuel as well as members of Ishmael’s family defy Nephi, three of Ishmael’s daughters, and Ishmael and his wife. They want to go back to Jerusalem. When Nephi warns them that they will be destroyed if they do so, they tie him up, planning to leave him behind on their journey. Nephi&#x27;s bonds are loosed by the Lord when he prays for help. Laman and Lemuel want to tie him again, but eventually give in to the pleas of mercy from Ishmael&#x27;s family.

Nephi and his family spend eight years in the wilderness, facing many hardships. At one point Nephi&#x27;s bow breaks, making it difficult to obtain food. While the rest of the family complains, Nephi sets forth to make a new bow and prays to God for help.

=== Building the ship and voyage ===
Finally, in the land of Bountiful, God commands Nephi to build a ship and sail to the Promised Land. However, Laman and Lemuel do not think he should build it. They try to throw Nephi into the depths of the sea; however, Nephi commands them not to, warning them that they will be smitten by the power of God if they touch him. In response, Laman and Lemuel try worshipping Nephi, but he commands them to stop. Meanwhile, the Spirit protects Nephi.

Partway through the voyage over sea, Laman, Lemuel, and some of Ishmael&#x27;s family participate in irreverent revelry. Nephi asks them to stop, but in their anger they tie him up. The Liahona stops working and they are significantly delayed in their journey until the brothers finally untie him. This done, Nephi prays to God and the storm calms down.

=== Life in the Promised Land ===

Not long after arriving in the Promised Land, Lehi dies, leaving the leadership of the colony in Nephi&#x27;s hands. His brothers Laman and Lemuel rebel shortly thereafter, and the colony splits into two. Nephi&#x27;s followers name themselves &quot;Nephites&quot; while the others are dubbed &quot;Lamanites.&quot; The Nephites separate into the wilderness, where they begin building in the land of Nephi. Within twenty-one years of arriving in the Promised Land, Nephi&#x27;s people construct a temple. Nephi teaches his people artisan skills, including but not limited to wood and metal work. Under Nephi&#x27;s leadership, the Nephite civilization prospers despite occasional war with the Lamanites. According to the Book of Mormon, Nephi is revered by his people. Upon his death, Jacob is entrusted with keeping the records of the Book of Mormon.

== Nephi&#x27;s vision ==

After his father receives a Vision of the Tree of Life, Nephi receives a similar vision and records it in detail, including an interpretation of each element of the dream. Nephi also sees and records details of the birth, life, and crucifixion of Jesus Christ. An angel also shows him similar things to those found in the vision of John the Revelator.

== Latter-day Saint interpretation ==
=== Obtaining the brass plates ===
Anthropologist Steven L. Olsen points out that the journey to possess the brass plates is the first instance in which Nephi is portrayed as a leader of his brothers. Additionally, Olsen points out that deliverance and remembering are themes that show up in Nephi&#x27;s account. In fact, the concept of deliverance is one factor in Nephi&#x27;s contemplation of killing Laban. Writing about this contemplation, R. John Williams, who is an assistant professor of English at Yale, concludes that while Nephi&#x27;s internal struggle is very personal, his rationalization of killing Laban appears to be more unemotional. According to Hardy, Nephi&#x27;s difficult decision demonstrates the value of the brass plates to his family. Robert L. Millet explains that the brass plates serve as a link between the Nephites and their predecessors. The content of the plates gives the people a connection to their ancestors, culture, and religious beliefs.

Further, healthcare technologist Ben McGuire identifies what he calls &quot;thematic parallels&quot; between Nephi&#x27;s slaying of Laban and David&#x27;s killing of Goliath; among the parallels are confrontation with an intimidating foe, fear of the foe, and slaughter of the foe. Author Elizabeth Fenton, on the other hand, compares Nephi and Laban to David and Saul, pointing out that Nephi killed Laban but David did not kill Saul, while both were encouraged to kill said enemies.

=== The ship ===
The design for Nephi&#x27;s ship is divine, which theme is common in various Biblical stories, says legal editor Alan Goff. He points out that Nephi wants to make it clear that he is following a divine pattern. On another note, Riess compares Nephi&#x27;s calming of the water to Jesus&#x27; calming of the storm in the New Testament, pointing out that while Jesus used his own power, Nephi prayed.

=== Visions ===
Like others, during his visions Nephi is often taken by the Spirit into a mountain. Brent Farley, who is the former manager of Church Educational System College Curriculum within the LDS church, explains in a devotional-type article that this transportation by the Spirit to a mountain typically occurs in religious records when a temple is unavailable to worship in.

== Nephi as a narrator ==
Though Nephi begins his narrative with a basic genealogy, he eventually shifts from a familial to a national focus. Nevertheless, he is conscious of his posterity as he writes. Nephi desires that his record should be filled with religious things. Hardy proposes that Nephi portrays Laman and Lemuel in a negative light in order to solidify his purpose of showing the Lord’s deliverance. Nephi rarely talks about Laman and Lemuel individually, and hardly mentions Sam—possibly an attempt to greater emphasize Laman and Lemuel. Robert A. Rees agrees concerning Nephi&#x27;s rhetorical purposes, stating that Nephi is deliberately shaping the reading experience. He argues that Nephi brings his first-person biases into the narrative, making it difficult for his readers to have an impartial perspective. In Claudia L. Bushman&#x27;s view, Nephi emphasizes different aspects of the narrative more than others, which impacts the reader experience. According to Hardy, however, Nephi’s motives are not only religious but also political. Latter-day Saint lawyer Nathan B. Oman explains that legal issues are woven into Nephi&#x27;s narrative, especially those that concern his brothers.

Fenton argues that Nephi did not write the Book of Mormon for the Nephites, as implied by his inclusion of his dream about their destruction. Nephi was well-versed in Jewish scripture and could read and write in Egyptian. His teaching style has been described as &quot;frank, direct, and even blunt.&quot; At the same time, Rees suggests that Nephi may have drawn inspiration for his writing style from passages found in the brass plates. Allusions to the Exodus are deliberate throughout Nephi&#x27;s record, Michael Austin explains. Hardy notes several parallels between Nephi and Joseph: both are younger, favored sons whose older brothers resent him and attempt to murder him. Both escape death and later save their families from starvation. Contrasting the stories, Hardy finds that Joseph&#x27;s story has more emotional range, whereas Nephi&#x27;s narrative is limited to his &quot;one-sided narrative.&quot; Bushman also notices that Nephi relies very little on the experiences of the other members of his travel party.

Writing in in 1969, Robert E. Nichols noticed similarities between Nephi and a writing style from the heroic age. As evidence, Nichols draws parallels between the narrative&#x27;s emphasis on Nephi&#x27;s strength and manly skills and Beowulf&#x27;s great strength and skills in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. In this reading, Nephi&#x27;s beot, or ritual boast, is found in the famous passage where he says he will &quot;go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded,&quot; and his brothers become his band of warriors.

== Nephi&#x27;s legacy ==
The first major figure in the Book of Mormon, Nephi is regarded by members of the Latter Day Saint Movement as a prophet, political leader, and record keeper. Bergin points out that Nephi shares some semblance to Moses, such as being a colonial leader. Riess also points out similarities between the two, such as their both receiving commandments from the Lord atop a mountain. A number of individuals throughout the Book of Mormon were named after Nephi, including all of the kings in the early Nephite civilization. Additionally, his people referred to themselves as &quot;Nephites&quot;–a name that followed them through the entire 1000-year history given in the Book of Mormon. Nephi is also the name of a city in Utah.

== Etymology of &quot;Nephi&quot; ==
The origin of the name &quot;Nephi&quot; is uncertain and disputed. Based on a non-Latter-day Saint or secular perspective, hypotheses for the name&#x27;s origin include:
* Its appearance as a geographic name in 2 Maccabees of the Deuterocanon: &quot;And Neemias called this thing Naphthar, which is as much as to say, a cleansing: but many men call it Nephi.&quot;
* A reference to the &quot;nephilim&quot; ( נְפִילִים ), who are the mythical half-immortal &quot;giants&quot; described in Genesis. The name means &quot;fallen ones.&quot;
* Or the term &quot;Nephes&quot;, which is a Kabbalistic term for a ghost that wanders around sepulchers.

Latter-day Saint scholar John Gee theorizes that Nephi is a Hebrew form of the Egyptian name &quot;Nfr&quot;. In Phoenician and Aramaic inscriptions of Egyptian names containing &quot;nfr&quot;, the &quot;nfr&quot; element is rendered &quot;npy&quot;, and the closely related Hebrew language would presumably transcribe the name the same way.

== Nephi in Latter-day Saint literature ==
Orrin R. Wilcox writes about the journey of Nephi&#x27;s family in verse form, telling it from Nephi&#x27;s perspective. In two of the poems Wilcox shares the story of why Nephi&#x27;s family left Jerusalem, then describes the family relationships. &quot;I was built large in stature / And my brothers did defy,&quot; he explains. Wilcox continues to contrast Nephi with Laman and Lemuel, specifically discussing their attitudes about leaving Jerusalem. Later, he writes about obtaining the brass plates and visiting Ishmael&#x27;s family. When he writes about the brass plates, Wilcox explores the feelings and actions of Nephi as he kills Laban and brings Zoram with him.

In her collection &quot;Book of Mormon and Other Poems,&quot; Latter-day Saint poet Mildred Hunt includes a poem that tells of the retrieval of Ishmael&#x27;s daughters in an allegory of gardeners coming to select beautiful willow and cypress trees for their homes, where the trees represent Ishmael&#x27;s daughters and the gardeners represent the sons of Lehi. She spends most of the poem describing the grace and beauty of the trees; in the last stanza, however, she tells how their father let the four gardeners select their trees of choice. In her poetry she also explores how Nephi may have felt at various points in his life, including an inference of what successes he may have experienced: &quot;How thankful and how pleased, Nephi, were you / When that first harvest gilt the wilderness.&quot;

An emeritus English professor at Pepperdine University and Latter-day Saint, Michael R. Collings wrote a book entitled &quot;The Nephiad&quot;. This epic-style work retells parts of the life of Nephi, from Lehi&#x27;s revelation to leave Jerusalem to Nephi&#x27;s vision of Jesus Christ, with some creative imagination. Collings describes Nephi&#x27;s vision of the Americas at the time of Jesus&#x27; death as follows: &quot;This Nephi saw, and fain would turn away / Tormented eyes from scenes calamitous / ...Tempests, floods, and quakings o&#x27;er the Land / With fracturing force disrupted Spring-smooth soils.&quot;

<text>Leopold Charles Maurice Stennett Amery (22 November 1873 – 16 September 1955), also known as L. S. Amery, was a British Conservative Party politician and journalist. During his career, he was known for his interest in military preparedness, British India and the British Empire and for his opposition to appeasement. He was Secretary of State for the Colonies (1924-29), opposed the National Government of the 1930s and served as Secretary of State for India during the Second World War (1940-45). He was also a prolific writer whose output included a multi-volume history of the Second Boer War and several volumes of memoirs and (posthumously published) diaries.

Nowadays he is best remembered for the remarks he made in the House of Commons on 7 May 1940 during the Norway Debate, attacking the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, for incompetence in the fight against Hitler&#x27;s Germany. Many of Amery&#x27;s Parliamentary contemporaries pointed to this speech as one of the key drivers in the division of the House on the following day, 8 May, which led to Chamberlain being forced to resign and his replacement by Winston Churchill.

==Early life and education==
Amery was born in Gorakhpur, British India, to an English father and a mother of Hungarian Jewish descent. His father was Charles Frederick Amery (1833–1901), of Lustleigh, Devon, an officer in the Indian Forestry Commission. His mother Elisabeth Johanna Saphir (&quot;c&quot;. 1841–1908), who was the sister of the orientalist Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner, had come to India from England, where her parents had settled and converted to Protestantism. In 1877 his mother moved back to England from India, and in 1885 she divorced Charles.

In 1887, Amery went to Harrow School. Amery represented Harrow at gymnastics and held the top position in examinations for a number of years; he also won prizes and scholarships. Winston Churchill (born December 1874) was junior to him at Harrow, and on one occasion mistook Amery, who was very short in stature, for a younger boy and pushed him into Ducker, the school outdoor swimming pool. Churchill placated him by claiming that his father Lord Randolph Churchill was &quot;a great man&quot; but was also short, but neither man forgot the incident, and as late as June 1934 Amery would mention the incident in his diary while recording how he had humiliated Churchill in a debate over India.

After Harrow he went to Balliol College, Oxford, where he performed well. He gained a Double First in Classical Moderations (classical languages) in 1894 and &quot;literae humaniores&quot; (&quot;Greats&quot;, i.e. classical literature, history and philosophy) in 1896; he was &quot;&quot; (runner-up) for the Craven scholarship in 1894 and Ouseley scholar in Turkish in 1896. He also won a half-blue in cross-country running.

He was elected a fellow of All Souls College. He could speak Hindi at the age of three years; Amery was born in India and would naturally have acquired the language of his ayah (nanny). He could converse in French, German, Italian, Bulgarian, Turkish, Serbian and Hungarian. Amery was an active freemason.

==Journalism==
During the Second Boer War Amery was a correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;. In 1901, in his articles on the conduct of the war, he attacked the British commander, Sir Redvers Buller, which contributed to Buller&#x27;s sacking. Amery was the only correspondent to visit Boer forces and was nearly captured with Churchill. Amery later edited and largely wrote &quot;The Times History of the South African War&quot; (7 vol., 1899–1909).

The Boer War had exposed deficiencies in the British Army and in 1903, Amery wrote &quot;The Problem of the Army&quot; and advocated its reorganisation. In &quot;The Times&quot; he penned articles attacking free trade using the pseudonym &quot;Tariff Reformer&quot; and in 1906, he wrote &quot;The Fundamental Fallacies of Free Trade&quot;. Amery described it as &quot;a theoretical blast of economic heresy&quot; because he argued that the total volume of British trade was less important than the question of whether British trade was making up for the nation&#x27;s lack of raw materials and food by exporting its surplus manufactured goods, shipping, and financial acumen.

He was a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers, set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb.

==Early political career==
Amery turned down the chance to be editor of &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1908 and of &quot;The Times&quot; in 1912 to concentrate on politics.

Standing as a Liberal Unionist (a party, whose strength was by this time concentrated in and around the City of Birmingham and who were in an electoral alliance with the Conservatives) Amery narrowly failed to win the 1908 Wolverhampton East by-election, by eight votes. In 1911 Amery stood in the 1911 Birmingham South by-election again as a Liberal Unionist, this time unopposed and became a Member of Parliament (MP). One reason that Amery agreed to stand there under the Liberal Unionist label (that party would fully merge with the Conservative Party the following year) was that he had been a long-time political admirer of Joseph Chamberlain and was an ardent supporter of tariff reform and imperial federation. According to A. J. P. Taylor, Amery was a rare Conservative to promote protectionism &quot;as merely the beginning of a planned economy&quot;.
Amery was a noted sportsman, especially famous as a mountaineer. He continued to climb well into his sixties, especially in the Swiss Alps but also in Bavaria, Austria, Yugoslavia, Italy and the Canadian Rockies, where Mount Amery is named after him. He enjoyed skiing as well. He was a member of the Alpine Club (serving as its president, 1943–1945) and of the Athenaeum and Carlton Clubs.

He was a Senior Knight Vice President of the Knights of the Round Table.

On 16 November 1910, Amery married Florence Greenwood (1885–1975), daughter of the Canadian barrister John Hamar Greenwood and younger sister of Hamar Greenwood, 1st Viscount Greenwood. She was normally known by the forename Bryddie. They had two sons.

==First World War==
During the First World War, Amery&#x27;s knowledge of Hungarian led to his employment as an Intelligence Officer in the Balkans campaign. Later, working for the war cabinet secretariat in Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition government, Amery was vested with parliamentary under-secretary like powers, and at the request of Lord Milner, he redrafted the Balfour Declaration.

Amery was greatly concerned with questions of grand strategy, and championed the idea of an &quot;all-red route&quot; to India, calling for Britain to control the sea-lanes to India not only via the Mediterranean-Suez Canal-Red Sea route, but also around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, and for Britain to control the main land routes to India in the Middle East as well. In 1917-1918, Amery advocated as war aims the British occupation of Palestine, Mesopotamia, Persia, Arabia and the Caucasus. Amery regarded Britain&#x27;s alliance with Imperial Russia as only temporary, and expected the traditional Anglo-Russian rivalry to resume after the war. However, the nation that Amery regarded as the most dangerous to the British Empire was Germany because the &quot;Reich&quot; had the world&#x27;s second largest economy and its policy of &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; (&quot;World Politics&quot;) was aimed at having Germany replace Britain as the world&#x27;s dominant power. Amery argued that German attempts to dominate Europe along with the Middle East were intended to serve as the basis to make the &quot;Reich&quot; the world&#x27;s number one power. In a memo written in April 1917, Amery traced the roots of German imperialism to Prussian imperialism in the 18th century. Amery argued that the Ottoman Empire had fallen into the German sphere of influence, and German efforts to push the influence of the &quot;Reich&quot; to the Persian Gulf were a major threat. Amery expressed much concern about the possible defeat of Russia under the Provisional Government which had taken over after the ousting of the Tsar in the February Revolution (March 1917 by the western calendar), writing that German control of Eastern Europe would be a major step towards allowing Germany to achieve &quot;world power status&quot;. After the October Revolution (November 1917 by the western calendar) Amery came to regard the new Soviet regime in Russia as a main threat to Britain&#x27;s position in Asia. 

Amery argued that under no circumstances should Britain and its allies return any of the German colonies in Africa and in the Pacific that had been captured by the Allies, arguing that the German colonial empire would allow the &quot;Reich&quot; to establish submarine bases that would threaten British shipping in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. Amery also warned that he foresaw the day when technological advances would allow submarines greater range, which led him to argue that a &quot;mesh&quot; of land, air, and naval bases would need to be established and led him to call for British annexation of German East Africa (modern Tanzania), German Southwest Africa (modern Namibia), the German colonies in the Pacific Ocean along with taking Mesopotamia and Palestine from the Ottoman Empire. Amery argued that with the Ottoman Empire having fallen into the German sphere of influence &quot;and with Germany installed at the gates of Egypt on one side and in East Africa on the other, the Prussian instinct would never rest till the two were linked together, and the great railroad empire became continuous from Hamburg to Lake Nyasa&quot;. In Europe, Amery argued that Britain&#x27;s chief aim was the liberation of Belgium. As for Britain&#x27;s allies, he advocated that the French should annex Syria and lesser Armenia from the Ottoman Empire while Russia should annex greater Armenia and Constantinople (modern Istanbul). Amery took it for granted that both Germany and the Ottoman Empire would continue as major powers after the war, and advocated Britain seizing the Middle East in order to provide the best basis for maintaining British power in Asia after the war.

The final draft of the Balfour Declaration issued on 1 November 1917 promising British support for a &quot;Jewish national home&quot; in Palestine was written by Amery. Amery was commissioned by the Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to write a declaration promising the support of H.M. Government for Zionism while also taking into account the objections of the anti-Zionists in the cabinet such as Lord Curzon and Edwin Montagu. Hence the Balfour Declaration as written by Amery only promised a &quot;Jewish national home&quot;, not a Jewish state, and likewise stated &quot;nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine&quot;. He also encouraged Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky in the formation of the Jewish Legion for the British Army in Palestine. 

The Bolshevik coup in Russia in November 1917 followed by the decision by Vladimir Lenin to sign an armistice with Germany in December 1917 caused profound alarm for Amery who argued that the new regime in Russia threatened to change the course of the war as Germany could now redeploy millions of soldiers from the Eastern Front to the Western Front, and allowed Germany the opportunity to dominate the Middle East via its proxy of the Ottoman Empire. Amery tended to be more concerned about the fate of the Middle East, writing that the Western front was a &quot;sideshow&quot; compared to the Near East. Besides the possibility that the Ottomans under the command of Erich von Falkenhayn might retake Baghdad, which the British had taken in 1917, he also argued that Falkenhayn would take advantage of the Russian Revolution to advance Ottoman forces into the Caucasus, Persia and finally into Central Asia. Amery expressed surprise that the Young Turk regime had not done more to achieve its pan-Turkish ambitions of uniting all the Turkic peoples into the Ottoman Empire, which he attributed to the backwardness of the Ottoman Empire. Amery argued that now that Russia was defeated Britain should fund and arm whatever Armenians had survived the Armenian genocide, along with Armenians who had served in the Imperial Russian Army, whom Amery believed would fight on as it was their only hope of survival. Amery argueed that Britain had a vested interest in ensuring that former Russian weapons stayed with the Armenians who served in the Russian Army to prevent those weapons &quot;from passing into the hands of Kurds and Tatars and be used either for massacring Armenians, or for arming pro-German gangs of brigands in Persia&quot;. Amery also envisioned British officers taking command of the proposed Armenian army. Amery was an &quot;easterner&quot; on questions of grand strategy, believing that the war was to be won in the Middle East and was opposed to &quot;westerners&quot; such as William Robertson and Douglas Haig who believed that the war would be won on the Western Front. Amery argued in late 1917-early 1918 that the Caucasus should be the prime British concern and that Britain needed to send more forces to Palestine and Mesopotamia to create an offensive line running from Alexandretta to the Caucasus &quot;in order to drive the Turks out of the Arab and Armenian regions and bring about a collapse of their forces and a demand for peace&quot;. Besides the Middle East, Amery was deeply concerned about Russia, writing that if the Bolsheviks took control of Odessa and the Black Sea coast of Ukraine, it would allow Germany all of the immense resources of Ukraine, and hence undercut the British blockade of Germany. He wrote that Britain needed to &quot;knock out&quot; the Ottomans before the Bolsheviks took control of South Russia, saying that it was critical to &quot;get into touch with South Russia through the Dardanelles&quot; in order to &quot;keep our friends in Russia going&quot; to tie down German forces on the Eastern Front. 

Amery was opposed to the Constitution of the League of Nations because he believed that the world was not equal and so the League, which granted all states equal voting rights, was absurd. He instead believed that the world was tending towards larger and larger states that made up a balanced world of inherently stable units. He contrasted that idea with what he called US President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s &quot;facile slogan of self-determination&quot;.

==First Lord of the Admiralty==
After the war, Amery was elected for the newly created seat of Birmingham Sparkbrook in the 1918 general election. From 1919 to 1921 he was Lord Milner&#x27;s personal secretary at the Colonial Office. He was First Lord of the Admiralty (1922–1924) under Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin. The Washington Naval Conference of 1921 to 1922 resulted in the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which reduced the strength of the Royal Navy and the naval estimates from over £83,000,000 to £58,000,000. Amery defended the financing of the Singapore Naval Base against both Liberal and Labour attacks. The plans for a Singapore Strategy caused opposition from Australian prime minister Stanley Bruce, who in a series of letters with Amery in 1923 made it clear that he much preferred that the main British naval base in the Asia-Pacific region be located in Sydney rather than Singapore. Amery in his replies to Bruce stressed that Hong Kong would serve as an &quot;advance base&quot; for the Royal Navy in the event of a war with Japan and that it was highly unlikely that the Japanese would attack Singapore on account of the distance between Japan and Southeast Asia. Amery argued that Sydney would serve as a secondary base, but could not serve as the main base as it was too far away from Southeast Asia. Amery convinced Bruce that the Singapore Strategy would serve to protect Australia and he dropped the demand for a naval base at Sydney. The construction of the Singapore base, which was misleadingly presented to the public as a fortress, proceeded slowly throughout the 1920s, being cancelled by Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s Labour government of 1924, but revived by the Conservative government of Stanley Baldwin after he won the 1924 election; the Baldwin government however proceeded so slowly that the base was far from finished when Baldwin lost the 1929 election.

==Colonial Secretary==
Amery was Colonial Secretary in Baldwin&#x27;s second government from 1924 to 1929. Amery expanded the role of the Commercial Adviser into the Economic and Financial Advisership under Sir George Schuster. He also created the post of Chief Medical Adviser, under Sir Thomas Stanton, and a range of advisers on education (Sir Hanns Visscher for Tropical Africa), agriculture (Sir Frank Stockdale), a Veterinary Adviser, and a Fisheries Adviser. He also set up the Empire Marketing Board.

A favourite scheme was to develop one or more colonies into white-ruled dominions, with special attention to Southern Rhodesia (modern Zimbabwe), Kenya, and Palestine. In Africa, he sought to create an East African Dominion composed of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika. The strong opposition by the overwhelming non-white populations in Africa, and by the Arabs in Palestine, destroyed his plans for Dominion status in those territories. The Permanent Mandates Commission, which oversaw Tanganyika (a mandated territory), opposed Amery&#x27;s plan. Amery argued that his guiding principle in East Africa was the same &quot;dual policy&quot; applied in Kenya, namely the &quot;protection&quot; of the black population while also being responsible for &quot;for the fullest development of those territories&quot; and &quot;those in particular of our race who had undertaken the task of that development&quot;. In effect, Amery was saying that the East African Dominion would be run in the interests of the British settlers in East Africa, especially in Kenya which had attracted a considerable number of such settlers. The model for the proposed East African Dominion was South Africa, a Dominion dominated politically by its white population. Tanganyika had attracted a number of German settlers when it had been the colony of German East Africa, and Amery wanted to join link Tanganyika to Kenya both to give the proposed Dominion a larger white population and for economic reasons. Uganda had not attracted many white settlers, but Amery wanted to include Uganda in the proposed Dominion as its rich soil made it highly productive for agriculture. 

Amery&#x27;s East African federation plans ran into opposition because Tanganyikan sovereignty technically belonged not to Britain but to the League of Nations. Amery insisted that Britain &quot;did&quot; own Tanganyika, and could with it as it pleased, and that the League of Nations mandate only imposed certain standards on Britain. In a speech on 11 June 1926, Amery stated: &quot;Our mandate in Tanganyika was in no sense a temporary tenure or lease from the League of Nations. It was rather what might be called in lawyer&#x27;s language a &quot;servitude&quot;, that is to say an obligation to observe certain rules of conduct with administration in that territory...We held Tanganyika under our obligations to the League of Nations, but we held in our right under the Treaty of Versailles. The foundations of the East Africa of the future were as sure and permanent in Tanganyika as they were in any other East African territory&quot;. 

Amery&#x27;s speech was vigorously rebutted by Heinrich Schnee, the last governor of German East Africa, who in an article in the &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; newspaper on 19 June 1926 pointed out that under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles Germany had transferred sovereignty over German East Africa to the League of Nations, appointed Britain as the administering power over what was now called Tanganyika. Schnee argued that Britain could not violate the Treaty of Versailles by changing the status of Tanganyika without first obtaining the approval of the League Council (the executive arm of the League of Nations). From the German viewpoint, maintaining the Tanganyika mandate was crucial since it was always possible that the League Council (which Germany joined as a permanent veto-holding member in 1926) might restore Tanganyika to Germany. Amery&#x27;s plans for an East African Dominion met with much opposition from the Indian merchants who dominated business life in East Africa and from the black African populations who saw the plans for a federation as a way to permanently disenfranchise them. A White Paper reflecting Amery&#x27;s views stated that the claims of the white settlers in East Africa &quot;to share progressively in the responsibilities of government could no longer be ignored&quot; and &quot;if clashes between these interests and those of the vast native populations are to be avoided, their [the white settlers] share in the trusteeship for the progress and welfare of the natives must be developed&quot;. The White Paper was taken as confirming Indian and African fears that the proposed &quot;Closer Union&quot; in East Africa was only for the benefit of the white settlers at their expense. The Conservative Party, the British settlers in Kenya, and Sir Edward Grigg, the governor of Kenya, all supported Amery&#x27;s plans for a &quot;Closer Union&quot; in East Africa. Opposed to Amery&#x27;s plans in Britain were the Labour Party; Amery&#x27;s own under-secretary at the Colonial Office, William Ormsby-Gore along with most of the civil servants of the Colonial Office; Sir Donald Cameron, the governor of Tanganyika; and various humanitarian groups who charged the federation would be run in the interests of the white settlers. A number of former and current Colonial Office officials such as Frederick Lugard and Ormsby-Gore opposed the proposed Dominion as they preferred, as a cost-saving measure, &quot;indirect rule&quot; via traditional African elites. Despite what Amery claimed, the Treaty of Versailles had assigned sovereignty over Tanganyika to the League of Nations and to change the status of Tanganyika required the approval of the League Council. The German Foreign Minister, Gustav Stresemann, was very committed to regaining Germany&#x27;s lost empire in Africa and made it clear to the British ambassador in Berlin that he would use the German veto at the League Council if Britain made an application to change the status of Tanganyika. 

The idea of having Southern Rhodesia (modern Zimbabwe) join South Africa as a &quot;fifth province&quot; was frequently mooted in the 1920s, but the unwillingness of the British settlers in Rhodesia to join an Afrikaner-dominated state ensured that nothing came of it. In 1927, Amery toured Africa and concluded that Southern Rhodesia would only join South Africa on its own terms to preserve its &quot;British character&quot;. Amery envisioned a future where the British settlers in Southern Rhodesia would build &quot;an independent Central South African Dominion to check and counterbalance the parochial South African Union&quot;.

In India, the strong resistance of the Congress movement defeated his hopes for greater integration into the Commonwealth. In the 1920s, the Palestine Mandate was seen as a backward, impoverished area and not the first choice for emigration of most European Jews. Amery carried out a policy of &quot;constructive Zionism&quot;: building infrastructure such as paved roads, public sanitation and a hydroelectric grid, intended to encourage Jewish immigration. In Malta Amery&#x27;s name became associated with the Royal Commission which recommended self-government for the Maltese following the 1919 riots in which four locals and one servicemen were killed. One of the most prominent streets in the resort town of Sliema was named after him.

==Out of office==
Amery was not invited to join the National Government formed in 1931. He remained in Parliament but joined the boards of several prominent corporations. This was necessary as he had no independent means and had depleted his savings during the First World War and when he was a cabinet minister during the 1920s. Among his directorships were the boards of several German metal engineering companies (representing British capital invested in the companies), the British Southern Railway, the Gloucester Wagon Company, Marks and Spencer, the famous shipbuilding firm Cammell Laird and the Trust and Loan of Canada. He was also chairman of the Iraq Currency Board.

In the course of his duties as a director of German metal engineering companies, Amery gained a good understanding of German military potential. Adolf Hitler became alarmed at the situation and ordered a halt to the appointment of non-German directors. Amery spent a lot of time in Germany during the 1930s in connection with his work. He was not allowed to send his director&#x27;s fees out of the country so he took his family on holiday in the Bavarian Alps. He had a lengthy meeting with Hitler on at least one occasion, and he met at length with Czech leader Edvard Beneš, Austrian leaders Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt von Schuschnigg and Italian leader Benito Mussolini.

==Opposition to appeasement of Germany==
In the debates on the need for an increased effort to rearm British forces, Amery tended to focus on army affairs, with Churchill speaking more about air defence and Roger Keyes talking about naval affairs. Austen Chamberlain was, until his death, a member of the group as well. While there was no question that Churchill was the most prominent and effective, Amery&#x27;s work was still significant. He was a driving force behind the creation of the Army League, a pressure group designed to keep the needs of the British Army before the public. Like most Conservative MPs, Amery had little faith in the League of Nations saying in the House of Commons in 1935: &quot;If we were victims of unprovoked aggression today we might as well call on the man in the street as make a direct appeal to the League&quot;.

In the 1930s Amery, along with Churchill, was a bitter critic of the appeasement of Germany; they often openly attacked their own party. Being a former Colonial and Dominions Secretary, he was very aware of the views of the dominions and strongly opposed returning Germany&#x27;s colonies, a proposal seriously considered by Neville Chamberlain. Amery&#x27;s opposition to appeasement was initially based primarily on opposition to the repeated German that the former German colonies in Africa &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;. Much of the Nazi claim to the former German African colonies was based on economic grounds as it was generally believed at the time that having African colonies to exploit was essential to the workings of European economies. The American Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 had set off a global trade war with the world broken up into various economic zones as nations imposed record high tariffs, which in particular was used as an argument why Germany needed its former colonial empire. On 5 February 1936, Amery was involved in a heated debate on the floor of the House of Commons with the former prime minister David Lloyd George who suggested that Britain and the Dominions return the former German colonies, saying that it was crucial for the peace of the world. Amery attacked Lloyd George, saying that the &quot;Reich&quot; lost its colonies as a result of a war that it had caused in 1914, and if Germany needed an &quot;economic zone&quot; to dominate, it should look to the &quot;great markets of Central Europe&quot;, not Africa. Amery&#x27;s statements indicated that he was open to Germany having Eastern Europe in its economic zone of influence. 

At a conference of the Conservative and Unionist Party&#x27;s local constituency associations in June 1936, Amery spoke very strongly against returning any of the German colonies currently held as League of Nations mandates by Great Britain or the Dominions. Referring to pre-1914 colonial deals, Amery stated that it had been a mistake to import the &quot;German menace&quot; into Africa and that it would be a mistake to do so again, adding that Britain must not &quot;sell white men or black men into Nazi slavery&quot;. In a review of the book &quot;Germany&#x27;s Claims to Colonies&quot; by Ferdinand Joelson, Amery wrote &quot;For the moment, there can be no other attitude to the German demand than a purely negative one. The issue should not be treated as open to discussion&quot;. However, Amery tempered his opposition to returning the former German colonies by writing that if the German government was headed by somebody other than Adolf Hitler, then perhaps &quot;some positive solution to what underlies this demand may be found when the present ferment has worked itself out, and when a more normal outlook has regained ascendency over the great German nation&quot;. Amery conceded that the present was an age of &quot;economic nationalism&quot; with nations imposing high tariffs on each other, and that Hitler&#x27;s claim that the global trade war was hurting the German economy was correct. Amery ended by writing that the system of Imperial preference tariffs, which had turned the British empire into one economic unit (the Ottawa Agreement of 1932), was what allowed Britain to be a great power, and it was up to Hitler to negotiate a similar system to the Imperial preference tariffs with the states of Eastern Europe.

On the rearmament question, Amery was consistent. He advocated a higher level of expenditure, but also a reappraisal of priorities through the creation of a top-level cabinet position to develop overall defence strategy so that the increased expenditures could be spent wisely. He thought that either he or Churchill should be given the post. When the post of Minister for Co-ordination of Defence was finally created and given to a political lightweight, Sir Thomas Inskip, he regarded it as a joke.

Amery differed from Churchill in hoping throughout the 1930s to foster an alliance with fascist Italy to counter the rising strength of Nazi Germany. A united front of Britain, France, and Italy would, he felt, have prevented a German occupation of Austria, especially with Czechoslovakia&#x27;s support. He thus favoured appeasing Italy by tacitly conceding its claims to Ethiopia. A start was made in the so-called Stresa Front of 1935, but he felt that Britain&#x27;s decision to impose economic sanctions on Italy, for invading Ethiopia in 1936, drove Italy into the arms of Germany. 

Amery later stated that feelings against the Soviet Union within the Conservative Party were running high in 1936 after the Soviet intervention in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side, but by 1937 the Soviet Union &quot;hardly came into the picture&quot; as the passions caused by Spain had cooled. He noted that most Conservative MPs strongly disliked the Soviet Union because of the Russian debt repudiation of 1918 (the largest debt repudiation in history), which caused a number of financial problems for Britain, and also for the continuing Comintern propaganda. During the Sudetenland crisis of 1938, Amery moved away somewhat from his anti-Soviet views as he stated it was a &quot;fundamental mistake&quot; by Chamberlain to treat the Soviet offer of help for Czechoslovakia as a joke, saying that it was a major blunder by the prime minister &quot;to refuse take Russia into his confidence&quot;. Amery favoured Churchill&#x27;s approach of creating a &quot;grand alliance&quot; of the Soviet Union, France and Britain to deter Germany from invading Czechoslovakia. During two meetings both held on 26 September 1938, the first at the office of General Edward Spears and the second at Churchill&#x27;s flat, Amery negotiated with Churchill, Spears, the Liberal leader Archibald Sinclair and the president of the League of Nations Union Viscount Cecil to find a way to create the &quot;grand alliance&quot;. Amery wrote in his diary that the main theme of the meetings was the importance of &quot;bringing Russia into the picture&quot; and that he was &quot;all for pressing the government on this&quot;. He wrote that &quot;it was not only the Western powers that were concerned about Czechoslovakia. In Russian eyes it was an outpost and bastion of Slavdom...the key to the whole strategic picture in Central Europe, not to be lightly surrendered to a declared enemy&quot;. Amery himself found advocating an alliance with the Soviet Union distasteful as he never concealed his dislike of the Communist regime, but felt in that 1938 it was the lesser evil. However, Amery admitted that as a Conservative MP it was difficult to be a rebel against Chamberlain, a man who commanded the loyalty and respect of most of the Conservative MPs, writing that Churchill &quot;wished for some public declaration by us, as Conservatives, that we stood for co-operation with Russia, to which I strongly objected&quot;. Amery stated he could not make this declaration as it would be the effective end of his political career by rebelling against a popular leader in favour of an alliance with a state he hated. Amery further noted that it was widely understood by military experts that the purge of senior officers in the &quot;Yezhovschina&quot; had wrecked the Red Army at least for the moment and that the Soviet Union had no border with Czechoslovakia, writing that if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia &quot;Russia could not, indeed, have sent direct aid to Czechoslovakia, even by air, without Romanian or Hungarian consent&quot;. However, he noted that the Soviet Union as an ally could &quot;have threatened action against Poland and Hungary, to restrain them from falling on Czechoslovakia&#x27;s rear&quot;. 

When Chamberlain announced his flight to Munich to the cheers of the House, Amery was one of only four members who remained seated (the others were Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Nicolson). In 1939, Amery joined Churchill, Lloyd George, Harold Macmillan, Brendan Bracken, Victor Cazalet and most of the Labour Party in voting against the White Paper introduced by the Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald that sharply limited Jewish immigration to the Palestine Mandate. When war came Amery, a lifelong anti-Communist, opposed cooperation with the Soviet Union against Germany.

==Second World War==
Amery is famous for two moments of high drama in the House of Commons early in the Second World War. On 2 September 1939, Neville Chamberlain spoke in a Commons debate and strongly implied that he was not declaring war on Germany immediately even if it had invaded Poland. Amery was greatly angered, and Chamberlain was felt by many present to be out of touch with the temper of the British people. As Labour Party leader Clement Attlee was absent, Arthur Greenwood stood up in his place and announced that he was speaking for Labour. Amery shouted, &quot;Speak for England, Arthur!&quot; That strongly implied that Chamberlain was not doing so (in fact the delay was caused by waiting for the French to promise to go to war also).

The second incident occurred during the Norway Debate in 1940. After the failure of the expedition to Norway, Amery told the House of Commons: &quot;If we had held Trondheim, the isolated German force at Narvik would have been bound to surrender&quot;. After a string of military and naval disasters had been announced, Amery attacked Chamberlain&#x27;s government in a devastating speech, finishing by quoting Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s words dismissing the Rump Parliament: &quot;You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!&quot; Lloyd George afterwards told Amery that in fifty years, he had heard few speeches that matched his in sustained power and none with so dramatic a climax. The debate led to 42 Conservative Members of Parliament voting against Chamberlain and 36 abstaining, leading to the downfall of the Conservative-dominated National Government and the formation of a new coalition government under Churchill. Amery himself noted in his diary that he believed that his speech was one of his best received in the House and that he had made a difference to the outcome of the debate.

==Secretary of State for India and Burma==
During the Churchill war ministry Amery was Secretary of State for India despite the fact that Churchill and Amery had long disagreed on the fate of India. Amery was disappointed not to be made a member of the small War Cabinet, but he was determined to do all he could in the position he was offered. He was continually frustrated by Churchill&#x27;s intransigence, and in his memoirs, he recorded that Churchill knew &quot;as much of the Indian problem as George III did of the American colonies&quot;. Through committed to the British Empire, Amery thought Churchill&#x27;s views towards India were unrealistic. Amery was the only India Secretary to have been born in India and he was fluent in Sanskrit, giving him a closer commitment to India than previous India Secretaries. 

In the autumn of 1941 as war with Japan loomed, the Governor of Burma, Reginald Dorman-Smith, had agreed that the Burmese prime minister, U Saw, should go to London to discuss with Amery and Churchill Dominion status for Burma. Amery was less than enthusiastic about meeting U Saw. Churchill had no interest in Dominion status for Burma and agreed to see U Saw only once with the rest of the talks to be handled by Amery. U Saw duly arrived in London in October 1941 for a series of inconclusive meetings with Amery, where he was told that the issue of Burmese independence was complex. On the morning of 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the British Empire with Hong Kong and Malaya being bombed and invaded that day. U Saw who was in Lisbon on his way home to Burma stopped by at the Japanese embassy to offer his support for Burma joining the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. As the British had broken the Japanese codes, Amery was well aware of what U Saw had done. Amery sent a message to Dorman-Smith ordering that U Saw was to be arrested immediately upon his return to Burma for his &quot;treacherous act&quot;. 

On 2 February 1942, Amery told the cabinet that the recent British defeats in Asia had shattered the prestige of the British Raj at a time when Britain needed the support of the Indians the most, and that the government would have to change its policy and engage with Indian public opinion to win their support for the war. Later in February 1942, the Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek and his charismatic English-speaking wife Soong Mei-ling visited India on a well received visit, offering the message that the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere was a sham and warning starkly that the when Japan invaded India the Imperial Japanese Army would treat the Indian people just as badly as it had treated the Chinese, repeating atrocities such as the Rape of Nanking. Chiang urged the British to promise India independence after the war, but also urged Indians to support the British war effort, saying that British rule was preferable to Japanese rule. The favourable reception of Chiang&#x27;s visit to India seemed to offer a way forward to win the war in Asia. 

In March 1942, the cabinet dispatched Stafford Cripps, a prominent left-wing politician (currently expelled from the Labour Party), on a mission to India to offer Dominion status for India after the war in exchange for Indian support for the British war effort, but with the additional condition that Britain would concede the demand of Muhammad Ali Jinnah&#x27;s Muslim League for a separate nation for Indian Muslims to be called Pakistan. Cripps landed in India on 22 March 1942. Upon hearing of the Cripps mission, the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, asked Amery &quot;Why?&quot; Amery assured Linlithgow that the purpose of the Cripps mission was to &quot;help&quot; him rule India by ending the opposition of the Congress Party to the Raj.

The American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had made it clear to Churchill that he believed that Britain should grant independence to India, and as the United Kingdom was in effect being economically subsidised by the United States from 1941 onward, it was difficult for Churchill to reject Roosevelt&#x27;s advice outright as much as he wanted to. Amery seemed to regard the Cripps mission as only useful for its effect on American public opinion as he wrote to Linlithgow in March 1942 that American public opinion would be impressed by &quot;us sending out someone who has always been an extreme Left-Winger and in close touch with Nehru&quot;. Amery believed that the Cripps would fail as the British offer of independence for India was also tied to a partition of India, a condition that both he and Churchill knew would be rejected by Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru of the Congress Party who wanted independence without partition. There was a split within the Congress Party between Gandhi who took an absolute pacifistic position of opposing all wars on principle &quot;versus&quot; Nehru who took a more anti-fascist position and often suggested that he was prepared to support Britain provided independence was promised for India. In one speech, Nehru had declared: &quot;Hitler and Japan must go to hell! I shall fight them to the end and this is my policy. I shall also fight Mr. Subhas Bose and his party along with Japan if he comes to India.&quot; During his talks with Cripps, Nehru was quite willing to accept Cripps&#x27; offer of Congress Party support for the war in exchange for Dominion status after the war, saying it was imperative that the Axis powers be defeated, and that Japan would be a far worse colonial master for India than Britain. However, the Cripps-Nehru talks broke down on the Pakistan question as Nehru was unwilling to accept the partition of India, and told Cripps that this part of his offer was unacceptable. Gandhi argued that the offer of independence tied to Pakistan as well as independence for the Princely States would lead to the &quot;Balkanisation of India&quot;, and Nehru agreed with him. Churchill argued to Roosevelt that Indian Muslims made up the majority of the Indian Army and that India had 100 million Muslims, making it the most populous Muslim community in the world, and Britain could not afford to anger Jinnah of the Muslim League who wanted independence with partition. On 6 April 1942, the Cripps mission entered in failure as Gandhi and Nehru rejected Cripps&#x27;s offer of independence after the war in exchange for support for the British war effort; as a dejected Cripps prepared to return to London, the Japanese bombed Calcutta for the first time. The Congress Party was deeply distrustful of the British and were angry about Amery having apparently given the Muslim League the right to create Pakistan as part of the deal. For their part, Amery along with other British officials, believed that Gandhi was extremely naïve in thinking that peaceful &quot;soul force&quot; would be all that would be needed to stop the Japanese invasion, the apparently imminent. Despite the loss of Burma, Amery was corresponding with Dorman-Smith in August 1942 about not only how best to restore British rule in Burma after Japan was defeated, but also plans to annex Thailand on the account of Thailand joining the war on the Axis side. 

In August 1942, Gandhi and Nehru launched the Quit India Movement protests, starting the largest demonstrations yet against the Raj, demanding that the British grant India independence immediately. Linlithgow in a report to Amery called the Quit India movement &quot;the most serious [uprising] since that of 1857&quot;. Officially, 1,028 Indians were killed during the protests, but the number may have actually as high as 25,000. Linlithgow also complained that the protests were being well covered by the American media and wrote to Amery asking him &quot;to arrest at least for a time this flow of well meaning sentimentalists&quot;. Despite the massive demonstrations along with associated sabotage, Churchill insisted that most Indians were still loyal to the Raj as Churchill believed the Muslims, Sikhs and Christian communities of India along with untouchable caste and all of the Indians living in the Princely States were all loyal and by his estimate 300 million of the 400 million Indians wanted the British to stay. Churchill tended to conflate volunteers for the Indian Army with support for the Raj, and he assumed that because the Indian Army were still meeting its recruiting targets that this reflected widespread public support for the Raj. However, most of the Indians volunteering for the Indian Army in 1942 were Muslims, and notably the Indian Army had difficulty recruiting Hindus, the most numerous of India&#x27;s many religious groups. Unlike the Congress Party, the Muslim League had declared its support for the war, and Jinnah and the other Muslim leaders encouraged Indian Muslims to enlist in the Indian Army. Churchill expressed much anger at the Quit India movement, and Amery complained about Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Nazi-like&quot; attitude towards Indians, especially Hindus, along with a belief that Churchill was wrong in believing that 300 million Indians supported the Raj. As too many Indians were taking part in the Quit India protests, it was impossible to jail all of them, leading the Raj to resort to corporal punishment with Indians being flogged for protesting. In response to newspaper accounts of &quot;dreadfulness&quot; about the floggings, Amery assured the House of Commons that the police were not flogging people with Cat o&#x27; nine tails whips, but instead with &quot;light rattan canes&quot; to &quot;deter hooligans&quot;. Amery did not mention that being flogged with &quot;light rattan canes&quot; was immensely painful, but he argued that mass floggings were necessary as there were far more &quot;hooligans&quot; taking part in the Quit India protests than were prisons for them. Much to Amery&#x27;s relief, the Indian Army, which was called out as an aid to civil power as the police forces were overwhelmed by the Quit India protests, stayed loyal to the Raj. Amery reported to the cabinet on 24 August 1942 that &quot;the soldiers regard Congress as contemptible politicians&quot;. Amery stated that within the Indian Army the general feeling was that the prime danger facing India was a Japanese invasion, and most of the Indian soldiers felt that the timing of the Quit India movement was very wrong. As a result of the uprising, the Congress Party was banned while the Muslim League which was opposed to Quit India remained legal.

In December 1942, Linlithgow reported to Amery of a &quot;disastrous deterioration of supplies&quot; and that a famine was imminent in the Bengal province. In January 1943, Amery reported to the cabinet that food shortages were becoming a major problem in India. Before 1942, 15% of the rice consumed in India had come from Burma, and the Japanese conquest of Burma had cut India off from the Burmese rice crop. Adding to the shortages were a series of cyclones that devastated the rice crop in Bengal province in the fall of 1942, and by December 1942 children and old people in Bengal were starving to death as it was reported to London that India was short of one million tons of rice that were necessary to feed its people. When Linlithgow decided to retire as Viceroy in 1943, Amery recommended to Churchill that he appoint either the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden or the Deputy Prime Minister Clement Attlee as the next Viceroy. Churchill refused on the grounds that he needed both Eden and Attlee in the cabinet. On 8 June 1943, Amery nominated himself as the next Viceroy, writing in a memo to the prime minister of: &quot;...the very special difficulties which a new Viceroy will have to handle. The whole situation in India today depends upon the Viceroy&#x27;s ability from the onset to manage and impose his personality upon a Council composed mainly of Indians, men of individual ability and goodwill, but easily ratted or turned sour by hesitant or clumsy handling. They are like an Indian elephant, who with a good mahout, will face a charging tiger; if the mahout is stupid, or loses his nerve for a second, nothing can stop the beast from stampeding in terror...a stampede that may wreck the whole fabric of government in India&quot;. Amery concluded that since the &quot;very best men&quot; such as Eden and Attlee could not be spared to serve as Viceroy, &quot;as a last resort, I have already offered you myself&quot;. Churchill instead chose Field Marshal Archibald Wavell as the next Viceroy in the hope that Wavell would pursue a repressive policy towards Indian demands for independence. Contrary to Churchill&#x27;s hopes, Wavell proved far more willing than Linlithgow to negotiate with the Indians as Wavell sought a political solution instead of the military solution that Churchill had hoped for. Amery tended to support Wavell&#x27;s efforts to reach a political solution and consistently spoke in defence of Wavell in cabinet meetings. To replace Wavell who been promoted to Viceroy of India, Churchill wanted to appoint Air Chief Marshal Sir Sholto Douglas as the new Supreme Commander of South-East Asia Command, a choice vetoed by Roosevelt on the account of Douglas&#x27;s anti-Americanism. Likewise Admiral Andrew Cunningham declined the offer and at Amery&#x27;s suggestion, Churchill appointed Admiral Louis Mountbatten as the Southeast Asia Supreme Commander.

In July 1943, the Raj reported that a famine had broken out in Bengal province and that it would necessary to ship 5,000,000 tons of grain from Australia to feed the staving people of Bengal. Amery wrote in his diary that at a cabinet meeting on 4 August 1943 he made the case for the grain shipments &quot;in as strong terms as I could&quot;, but was overruled by the cabinet. The War Secretary, James Grigg, stated that there was more than enough grain in India to feed the Bengalis and that the famine had been caused by Indian merchants hoarding grain to speculate on higher prices, leading him to conclude that this was an Indian problem that the Indians could solve on their own. On 5 August 1943, Churchill promised Amery that if the famine continued to worsen, the matter would be discussed at the next cabinet meeting. The same time, Churchill left for the First Quebec Conference with President Roosevelt, and no more cabinet meetings were held in the absence of the prime minister. During the famine, both Wavell and Amery consistently fought for food to be sent to Bengal. In the autumn of 1943, following further lobbying by Amery, the cabinet agreed that 50,000 tons of Australian wheat would go to Bengal with the first shipment arriving in November 1943. 

Amery opposed holding an inquiry for the 1943 Bengal famine, fearing that the political consequences could be &quot;disastrous&quot;. In 1944, the Famine Inquiry Commission was held against his advice. The report by the inquiry ruled that Bengal famine was &quot;avoidable&quot; and was due to &quot;mismanagement&quot; by both the Raj and the Bengal government. Unlike Churchill who had a marked dislike of Gandhi and the Congress Party and favoured Jinnah and the Muslim League, Amery had a strong dislike of Jinnah, to whom he referred as &quot;the future emperor of Pakistan&quot;, charging that Jinnah was championing the idea of partition of India because creating Pakistan was the only way he ever hope to attain power, as the Muslim League as suggested by its name represented only Muslims, and thus could not hope to win an Indian general election. Amery wrote that the concept of Pakistan was &quot;essentially a negation&quot; that would cause a bloodbath if the idea of partition of India was actually executed. Likewise, Amery was opposed to Churchill&#x27;s offer of Dominion status for India being tied to Dominion status for the all 565 Princely States, which he called &quot;princestan&quot; and thought was unrealistic as most of the princely states were extremely small, being enclaves the size of a municipal borough. 

In 1944, the British cabinet learned of an unusual offer from the &quot;Reichsfūhrer SS&quot;, Heinrich Himmler, that he was willing to suspend the deportation of the Jews of Hungary to the Auschwitz death camp in exchange for 10,000 lorries for the Wehrmacht to be used on the Eastern Front. This was an obvious attempt to break up the &quot;Big Three&quot; alliance of the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom. Amery told the Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann about the &quot;monstrous German blackmailing offer to release a million Jews in return for ten thousand lorries and other equipment, failing which bargain they proposed to exterminate them&quot;. Amery expressed much sympathy writing that both he and Cripps were in favour of keeping the commitments made by the latter in 1942 while Churchill was not. In May 1944, Wavell ordered the release of Gandhi who had been imprisoned since August 1942 on the grounds that if the Mahatma were to die in prison, it would set off massive riots. Wavell reported to Amery that Gandhi and Jinnah were not planning to meet anytime soon and he expected no resolution in the &quot;deadlock&quot; between the Congress Party and the Muslim League. Wavell added that both Gandhi and Jinnah were &quot;intransigents&quot; and neither had any willingness to compromise. Amery in his reply to Wavell stated that the Allies were finally advancing in Italy and that &quot;we might be on the outskirts of Rome in a few days&quot;. Amery further noted that many of the soldiers in the British Eighth Army that was marching north in Italy were Indian, and he hoped that the Indian newspapers were giving sufficient publicity to the achievements of the Indian &quot;tiger soldiers&#x27; in Italy, which he wanted to be seen as a model of Anglo-Indian cooperation in a common cause. In July 1944, Wavell reported to Amery that Gandhi might be willing to compromise by accepting the idea of Pakistan, but only with borders that would be so unfavourable that Pakistan would not be economically viable as Pakistan&#x27;s only ports under Gandhi&#x27;s plan would be Karachi and Dacca (modern Dhaka). Wavell added: &quot;One can hardly blame Jinnah for thinking twice before swallowing this whole&quot;. Wavell along with other senior civil servants of the Raj warned that to attempt to partition the Punjab would cause a bloodbath as the Sikh and Muslim communities of the Punjab would tear each other apart, and it would be better to keep India together by making concessions to the Indian Muslim minority. To further complicate matters, many Sikhs were unhappy about having to choose between Muslim majority Pakistan vs. Hindu majority India, and wanted the Punjab to be independent, a demand rejected by both Jinnah and Gandhi. Wavell reported to Amery that Gandhi was utterly incapable of understanding Jinnah&#x27;s fears that the Muslim minority would be oppressed in Hindu majority India, and he was not willing to make any compromises that might persuade Jinnah to drop his demand for Pakistan. Wavell himself favoured a compromise to avoid partition by making independent India into a federation with a weak central government and strong provincial governments, which he hoped might persuade Jinnah that the Indian Muslims would not be oppressed. Amery himself advanced a similar plan thought he felt Wavell&#x27;s efforts along these lines were too crude and blunt reflecting his background as a soldier and that he as a politician he was better suited for this task. 

Amery became increasing frustrated with what he regarded as Churchill&#x27;s obstinate and unrealistic views on India. He felt that it was impossible for a liberal democratic state to repress the demands for independence from the better part of 400 million people without betraying its values, and that the best that could done in India was to make a deal with the moderate Indian nationalists for support for the British war effort in exchange for Dominion status after the war. Amery often wrote in his diary that Churchill&#x27;s belief that no political solution was possible nor desirable and that the Indians could simply be repressed into being docile subjects of the Raj was as impractical as it was amoral. On 4 August 1944, Wavell reported that Gandhi had offered to end the Quit India protests and to support the British war effort in exchange for an immediate grant of Dominion status for India with no partition. Wavell rejected Gandhi&#x27;s offer, but himself offered to form a transitional government with a cabinet headed by Indians that would be granted Dominion status after the war in exchange for the Congress Party supporting the war effort. In the cabinet, Amery supported Wavell&#x27;s offer, saying it was the best way to end the disorders in India and bring the majority of the Indians over to supporting the war; Churchill by contrast was completely opposed and expressed much regret that he ever appointed Wavell as Viceroy. Churchill told the cabinet that Wavell should never negotiate at with Gandhi, a man whom Churchill called &quot;a thoroughly evil force, hostile to us in every fibre, largely in the hands of native vested interest&quot;. Churchill stated that Wavell was a disgrace as he was willing to talk to Gandhi, whom Churchill stated was &quot;a traitor who ought to be put back into prison!&quot; Amery wrote in his diary on 4 August 1944 that Churchill had attacked his patriotism and claimed that he supported the interests of &quot;Indian moneylenders over Englishmen&quot; in India. Amery concluded in his diary: &quot;Naturally, I lost patience, and I couldn&#x27;t help telling him that I didn&#x27;t see much difference between his outlook and Hitler&#x27;s, which annoyed him no little. I am by no means certain whatever on the subject of India he is totally sane&quot;. The next day, Churchill drafted a reply to Gandhi&#x27;s offer that demanded radical changes to the status of the untouchables as a precondition, which Amery criticised as negotiating in bad faith, noting that Churchill had never been much interested in improving the conditions of the untouchables before, and his demand about the untouchables was a wedge issue intended to divide the higher caste Hindus from the untouchables. In response, Churchill told him that he planned &quot;after the war he was going to go back on all the shameful story of the last twenty years of surrender&quot;. Churchill told Amery that he envisioned India as a British colony forever, that he would never grant independence to India under any conditions and that he planned to &quot;carry out a great regeneration of India based on extinguishing landlords and oppressive industrialists and uplift the peasant and untouchable, probably by collectivisation on Russian lines. It might be necessary to get rid of wretched sentimentalists like Wavell and most of the present English officials in India, who were more Indian than the Indians, and send out new men&quot;. Amery&#x27;s differing outlook towards India tended to push him towards the margins as he and Churchill had very different visions of the future of India.

In a satire of Churchill&#x27;s views, Amery wrote a mock memo entitled &quot;The Regeneration of India: Memorandum by the Prime Minister&quot;, where pretending to be Churchill Amery wrote: &quot;As the victorious end of this glorious struggle for human freedom draws near, the time is coming for a policy in relation to India more worthy of our true selves. We have had enough...of shameful pledges about Indian self-government, and of sickening surrenders to babu agitation. If we went even further two years ago in an open invitation to Indians to unite and kick us out of India that was only because we were in a hole. That peril is over and obviously a new situation has arisen of which we are fully entitled to take advantage&quot;. Continuing on his theme, Amery as Churchill wrote about Wavell that he was a man who: &quot;...would not only appear to have taken our pledges seriously, but to be imbued with a miserable sneaking sympathy for what are called Indian aspirations, not to speak of an inveterate and scandalous propensity to defend Indian interests as against those of their own country, and a readiness to see British workers sweat and toil for generations in order to swell even further the distended paunches of Hindu moneylenders&quot;. Amery continued his satire by writing that the Raj should aim at the destruction of the Hindu caste system and making the untouchables the equal of the other castes, which might generate resistance, leading him to write that &quot;it will also be necessary, following an excellent Russian precedent, to forbid any but trusted officials to leave India or to allow any visitors from outside except under the closest supervision by an official Intourist Agency.&quot; Amery as Churchill concluded that India would require a regime of martial law permanently to put an end to Indian demands for independence which would require a force of 1,600,000 British police officers and 8,000,000 Indian police officers along with the entire Indian Army and most of the British Army. Amery intended his memo to be a parody meant to show how impractical Churchill&#x27;s views were as the immense number of policemen and soldiers that would be needed to enforce permanent martial law in India would seriously strain the British budget at a time when Britain was financially dependent on the United States while the suggestion of the &quot;excellent Russian precedent&quot; was meant to show that Churchill would have to use methods similar to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s in the Soviet Union to achieve his vision of India as a permanent British colony. Amery&#x27;s support for Indian independence was not based on any sense of sympathy for Indian nationalism, but rather as the best way of securing British influence in South Asia as he believed that India as a Dominion would be rather like other Dominions such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand who generally followed Britain&#x27;s lead. As late as 1947 in a letter to Churchill just after Attlee announced the end of the Raj Amery expressed the viewpoint that &quot;we can only hope, that somehow or other, the Britannic orbit will remain a reality in this parlous world even if, to assume the worst, Indian politicians are unwise enough to break the formal link&quot;.

==Last years==
At the 1945 general election, Amery lost his seat to Labour&#x27;s Percy Shurmer. He was offered but refused a peerage because it might, when he died, have cut short the political career of his son, Julian, in the House of Commons. However, he was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour. In February 1947, after Attlee announced that India would be granted independence and partitioned into the new nations of India and Pakistan, Amery wrote a letter to the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, promising that he would write a lengthy letter to &quot;The Times&quot; &quot;to steady Conservative opinion here in case Winston proved factious&quot;. In retirement, Amery published a three-volume autobiography &quot;My Political Life&quot; (1953–1955).

==Legacy== 

Throughout his political career, Amery was an exponent of Imperial unity, as he saw the British Empire as a force for justice and progress in the world. He strongly supported the evolution of the dominions into independent nations bound to Britain by ties of kinship, trade, defence and a common pride in the Empire. He also supported the gradual evolution of the colonies, particularly India, to the same status, unlike Churchill, a free trader, who was less interested in the Empire as such and more in Britain itself as a great power . Amery felt that Britain itself was too weak to maintain its great power position.

Amery was very active in imperial affairs during the 1920s and 1930s. He was in charge of colonial affairs and relations with the dominions from 1924 to 1929. In the 1930s, he was a member of the Empire Industries Association and a chief organiser of the huge rally celebrating the empire at the Royal Albert Hall in 1936 marking the centenary of Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s birth. Amery maintained a very busy speaking schedule, with almost 200 engagements between 1936 and 1938, many of them devoted to imperial topics, especially Imperial Preference. Amery distrusted the administration of US President Franklin Roosevelt. He resented American pressure on Canada to oppose imperial free trade. While that pressure was unsuccessful as long as Canadian Conservative Prime Minister Richard Bedford Bennett was in power, after Bennett lost the 1935 election his Liberal successor William Lyon Mackenzie King adopted a more pro-American stance.

Amery wanted to keep the UK and the newly independent British Dominions united by trade behind a common tariff barrier and away from the United States. He viewed American intentions regarding the British Empire with increasingly grave suspicion. He hoped the Labour government elected in 1945 would resist promises of trade liberalisation made by Churchill to the United States during the Second World War. Amery&#x27;s hopes were partially vindicated when the Attlee government, under intense American pressure, insisted upon the continuation of Imperial/Commonwealth Preference but conceded its more limited scope and promised against further expansion.

==Personal life==
Amery&#x27;s elder son, John Amery (1912–1945), became a Nazi sympathizer. During the Second World War he made propaganda broadcasts from Germany, and induced a few British prisoners of war to join the German-controlled British Free Corps. After the war, he was tried for treason, pleaded guilty, and was hanged. His father amended his entry in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; to read &quot;one s[on]&quot;, with the editors&#x27; permission. The playwright Ronald Harwood, who explored the relationship between Leo and John Amery in his play &quot;An English Tragedy&quot; (2008), considered it significant to the son&#x27;s story that the father had apparently concealed his partly-Jewish ancestry.

Amery&#x27;s younger son, Julian Amery (1919–1996), served first in the Royal Air Force and then the British Army during World War Two, and later became a Conservative politician. He served in the cabinets of Harold Macmillan and Sir Alec Douglas-Home as Minister for Aviation (1962–1964) and also held junior ministerial office under Edward Heath. He married Macmillan&#x27;s daughter Catherine.

Amery is buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist in his father&#x27;s home village of Lustleigh, and an ornate plaque in commemoration of him is inside the church.

<doc id="480550" wikidata="Q1642148" url="?curid=480550" title="Thali">
<text>Thali (meaning &quot;plate&quot; or &quot;tray&quot;) or Bhojanam (meaning &quot;full meal&quot;) is a round platter used to serve food in South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. Thali is also used to refer to an Indian-style meal made up of a selection of various dishes which are served on a platter. Thali is also used in south Asia for ceremonial purposes.

== History ==
===Early history===

According to archeologist Bindeshwari Prasad Sinha, dish-on-stand and simple dishes belonging to the Indus Valley Civilization may be regarded as the prototype of Indian dishes as thalis but these do not have accompanying bowls commonly seen with thalis. According to Sinha the distinctive thali accompanying bowls instead appears in the Painted Grey Ware culture. Archeologist B.B. Lal similarly suggests food was eaten from the Painted Grey Ware dishes and bowls. B.B Lal notes that &quot;typical dinner set in the Painted Grey Ware consists of the thali (dish), katora (bowl) and lota (drinking vessel),&quot; he suggests it highlights the tradition followed today. Earliest textual sources on thali comes from Ayurveda Samhitas, Sangam and medieval period Indian cookbooks.

A chapter in ancient Sushruta Samhita text is dedicated to dining etiquette, method of serving food and proper placement of each dish before the diner, it is the earliest known textual evidence on thali presentation.

This dining and serving etiquette from Sushruta Samhita is also adopted in medieval Indian cookbooks with some variations.

The Manasollasa texts chapter &quot;Annabhoga&quot; describes dining etiquette, method of serving food and the way in which district officers and other nobles should be treated at dinner in the court.


The &quot;Ksemakutuhalam&quot; culinary text advises the cook to serve boiled rice in the middle of the plate. Pulse, meat, vegetables and fish are placed (in that order) on the right, and broths, drinks, water and pickles on the left.

In Ayurvedic tradition, six tastes known as &quot;Shadrasa&quot; is used to classify foods according to their qualities for ideal meal. These six tastes include; sweet, salty, sour, pungent, bitter, astringent. Thali presentation often includes all six of these flavors.

====Foreign accounts====
Greek ambassador Megasthenes in his work &quot;Indica&quot; notes the dining manners of Mauryan Empire court:
Portuguese ambassador Domingo Paes who visited the court of Vijayanagar Empire notes:
Portuguese ambassador Duarte Barbosa in coastal trading town of Kozhikode in Kerala notes the way local chieftains dined:

Meera Mukherjee suggests tripod or three-footed stool may have been similar to &quot;Mukkali&quot; stool, a type of vernacular furniture more commonly found in southern parts of India. While Chowki, Palagai or Bajot, a four-legged stool are more commonly used with thali today.

====Kansa metal====
Thalis are traditionally made with Kansa metal, a mixture of copper and tin. Although it is similar to bronze, Kansa has higher tin content than bronze. The fifth chapter of the text &quot;Rasaratna Samuchaya&quot; is dedicated to Kansa with significant information about Kansa kitchenware, diningware and its benefits.

== Thali/Bhojanam meal ==

&quot;Thali&quot; refers to the metal plate that a thali meal may be served on, while &quot;Bhojanam&quot; refers to full meals. Thali is popular method of serving meals in South Asia. The idea behind a thali is to offer different flavours of sweet, salt, bitter, sour, astringent and spicy on one single plate (technically the last two are actually forms of chemesthesis rather than true flavours). According to Indian food custom, a proper meal should be a perfect balance of all these six flavours. Restaurants typically offer a choice of vegetarian or meat-based thalis. Vegetarian bhojanams are very typical and commonplace in Tamil Nadu canteens

Dishes served in a thali vary from region to region in the Indian subcontinent and are usually served in small bowls, called &quot;katori&quot; in India. These katoris are placed along the edge of the round tray, the actual thali; sometimes a steel tray with multiple compartments is used. Typical dishes include rice, dal, vegetables, roti, papad, dahi (yogurt), small amounts of chutney or pickle, and a sweet dish. Rice or roti is the usual main dish that occupies the central portion of the thali, while side dishes like vegetable curries and other aforementioned delicacies are lined circularly along the round thali. Depending on the restaurant or the region, the thali consists of delicacies native to that region. In general, a thali begins with different types of breads such as puris or chapatis (rotis) and different vegetarian specialities (curries). However, in South India and Southeast Asia, rice is the only staple served with bhojanams. Thalis or Bhojanams are sometimes referred to by the regional characteristic of the dishes they contain. For example, one may encounter Andhra bhojanam, Nepalese thali, Rajasthani thali, Gujarati thali, Maharashtrian thali, Manipuri chakluk, Tamil unavu and Thai unavu. In many parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean, the bread and the rice portions are not served together in the thali. Typically, the bread is offered first with rice being served afterwards, often in a separate bowl or dish.

==Affordability==

The Economic Survey of India 2020 has a section called &quot;Thalinomics&quot;, the survey found that the vegetarian thalis became 29% more affordable compared to 2006-07, while non-veg thalis became 18% more affordable.

<doc id="480554" wikidata="Q5898597" url="?curid=480554" title="Hoosier National Forest">
<text>The Hoosier National Forest is a property managed by the United States Forest Service in the hills of southern 
Indiana. Composed of four separate sections, it has a total area of . Hoosier National Forest&#x27;s headquarters are located in Bedford, with a regional office in Tell City. Prominent places within the Forest include the Lick Creek Settlement, Potts Creek Rockshelter Archeological Site, and Jacob Rickenbaugh House.

==History==
Hoosier National Forest was first touched by humanity 12,000 years ago, when Native Americans in the United States hunted in the forest. Europeans reached the forest in the late 17th century, and began building villages in the forest. Actual lumbering began in the 19th century, with the cutting of more difficult terrain occurring after 1865. By 1910 most of the area had been cut. In the early 1930s the governor of Indiana pushed for the federal government to do something with the eroding lands that saw its residents leaving, with the act being accomplished on February 6, 1935.

Within Hoosier National Forest, two miles (3 km) south of Chambersburg, lies the former Lick Creek Settlement Site, a settlement of free blacks led by the Quaker Jonathan Lindley from around 1819 to around 1865. 
Pioneer Mothers Memorial Forest near Paoli contains an excellent example of virgin forest. Hemlock Cliffs Recreation Area in Crawford County contains one of the most scenic hiking trails in Indiana.

Most of Thomas Hines&#x27; Hines&#x27; Raid was within the present-day Hoosier National Forest.

Hickory Ridge Lookout Tower is the sole remaining fire tower out of eight that once stood within Hoosier National Forest. When built, there was a two-room house for the ranger and his dependents to live within, but it has since been destroyed. Visitors may still climb the tower but are advised to be cautious when climbing.

Maumee Scout Reservation and Lake Tarzian are also located within the Hoosier National Forest. Lake Tarzian is named after Sarkes Tarzian who led the capital campaign to build the camp.

==Science==

Much of Hoosier National Forest is over karst, responsible for the many caves in southern Indiana.

Included in Hoosier National Forest is the Charles C. Deam Wilderness Area, the only recognized wilderness area left in Indiana. This means that no motorized vehicles are allowed in the area, and instead mules and horses must be used to maintain hiking trails.

In the Clover Lick Barrens, the southern portion of Hoosier National Forest near the Ohio River, the vegetation is more typical of that found on prairies in the Great Plains. This was discovered by a botanist and biologist from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, who later found that in the first recorded survey of the area in 2005, the land was described not as forest, but as &quot;a mile of poor barrens and grassy hills&quot;. It is believed that the inability of tall oaks to grow in the area allows for this prairie vegetation to persist in such an unlikely location. In 2006 a conscious effort was made to keep the barren look to the area; previous federal efforts on renovating Hoosier National Forest meant adding nonnative species to low-growth areas. It was around Clover Lick in 1972 that Indiana decided to reintroduce wild turkeys back to Indiana, dedicating for the purpose.

Also found in Hoosier National Forest is Sundance Lake, a lake.

Hoosier National Forest lies in parts of nine counties in southern Indiana.

==Recreation==
The trail system has almost , and allows horseback riding and mountain bikes, along with hiking. Hikers are to yield to horses, and mountain bikers are to yield to both of them. Within the Hemlock Cliffs Valley, located within the central portion of the National Forest, there is the 1.2 mile Hemlock Cliffs trail. The trail is noted as access to sandstone cliffs and seasonal waterfalls as well as Hemlock trees and rare wintergreen plants.

===Hoosier National Forest Trail System===

All trail locations are within the state of Indiana.

<doc id="480557" wikidata="Q107282" url="?curid=480557" title="Coat of arms of Botswana">
<text>The [[coat of arms]] of [[Botswana]] was adopted on 25 January 1966. The centre shield is supported by two zebras. The shape of the shield is that of traditional shields found in Southern Africa. On the top portion of the shield are three cogwheels that represent industry.

The coat of arms is based on designs by Isabel Fawcus, whose husband Peter Fawcus was the Commissioner of Bechuanaland in 1960–65, and Shiela England.

The three waves symbolize water, and reminds the viewer of the motto of the nation: &quot;pula&quot;, which translates to &quot;rain&quot;, but also good luck, and is also the name of the nation&#x27;s currency. This motto also highlights the importance of water to Botswana. The motto is inscribed on a blue ribbon placed at the bottom of the coat of arms.

At the bottom of the shield is the head of a bull, which symbolises the importance of cattle herding in Botswana. The two zebras also symbolise the importance of wildlife, through tourism, in the national economy. Also, zebra have black and white stripes which represent equality of people of all colours in Botswana. The zebra on the right holds an ear of sorghum, an important crop in the nation. The zebra on the left holds a tusk of ivory, symbolic of the former ivory trade in Botswana. There is also a view that the ivory tusk represents wildlife preservation. Botswana has one of the highest elephant populations in Africa.

==Official description (blazon)==
The &quot;Botswana Emblems Act&quot; describes the coat of arms of Botswana as follows:

&quot;Argent three barrulets wavy in fesse Azure between in chief three cogwheels proper, one above engaged with two below and in base a bull&#x27;s head caboshed proper, and for the supporters on either side a zebra the dexter supporting a white elephant&#x27;s tusk the sinister a green stalk of sorghum and brown sorghum head with white grains proper. Motto &quot;Pula&quot; in black on a Botswana blue half tone scroll. The reverse side of the scroll is red.&quot;

<doc id="480558" wikidata="Q6099977" url="?curid=480558" title="Ivy the Terrible">
<text>Ivy the Terrible is a fictional character featured in &quot;The Beano&quot;. She is a four-year-old girl who annoys her parents with her misbehaviour. She first appeared in &quot;The Beano&quot; in 1985 in the comic strip of the same name, but has starred in other comic strips throughout &quot;Beano&quot; history.

==Character history==
===Concept===
In 1985, &quot;The Beano&quot;″s editor-in-chief Euan Kerr wrote to Robert Nixon about plans of creating a new character that was &quot;tough and menacing like Dennis and Minnie, but doesn&#x27;t have the strength or maturity to carry it off.&quot; The decided character design was a four-year-old girl named Ivy &quot;dressed in dungarees and T-shirt, and with bunches in her hair&quot;

===Introduction===
Ivy first appeared in issue #2233, dated 4 May 1985, drawn by Robert Nixon. Throughout the strip, it showed her attempts to become the toughest character in &quot;The Beano&quot;. Finally, when about to confront Dennis the Menace himself Dennis simply waited until evening at which point Ivy, being a toddler, had simply fallen asleep. He then took her back to her house and remarked, very out of character, that she &quot;almost looked cute&quot;. The popularity of the character led to the strip being expanded to two pages as of issue #2931 (19 September 1998). Later strips dropped the idea of her longing for toughness and instead concentrated on her hyperactivity and tantrums. Her popularity even grew to the point she was briefly featured in her own spin-off in which she would choose her favourite nightmares entitled &quot;Ivy&#x27;s Favourite Nightmares&quot;.

===Death of Nixon and later history===
Robert Nixon continued to draw Ivy until his death in 2002. His successor as artist was Tony O&#x27;Donnell, who drew the strip in a very similar style to Nixon, making no major changes to the strip or characters. However, Trevor Metcalfe drew several strips during 2003 and 2004, in which Ivy was given a noticeably more childlike and less malicious personality, although again the strip&#x27;s style was based on Nixon&#x27;s. In early 2007, O&#x27;Donnell retired from the strip, and reprints of 1989–1998 Robert Nixon stories began running.

In August 2008, the strip was merged with the strip Bea and renamed &quot;Bea and Ivy&quot;. However, when Dennis the Menace was revamped to match the new TV series a year later, Bea and Ivy were split up and she reverted to being a solo strip, again being reprinted Nixon strips, but this time the two-page stories from 1998 onwards were used.

In October 2010, new single page strips of Ivy started appearing in the Beano drawn by Diego Jourdan Pereira. Most of the title banners consisted of parodies of famous films such as &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;Fight Club&quot; and a tagline was introduced; &quot;Be thankful she&#x27;s not your little sister.&quot;
However, this only lasted until February 2011, as a change of editor at the Beano saw Ivy get dropped. Although a few of Diego Jourdan&#x27;s strips appeared after this point, they were simply stockpiled strips which had yet to be used.

In the 2008 and 2009 Beano Annuals, her strip was drawn by Steve Horrocks, in the 2011 edition she was drawn by Dave Eastbury, the Ball Boy artist, and in the 2012 edition she was drawn by Laura Howell.

In August 2014, Ivy returned, drawn by Lew Stringer.

==Personality traits==
Ivy can be compared to that of an average toddler in that she is extremely quick to anger and is prone to pulling temper tantrums when things are not quite going her way. She can at times be purposefully malicious, for example stamping on her father&#x27;s toes but most of the time it appears much of her deeds are all done by some fun which has gone out of hand. She has been seen to have a thirst to prove herself, for example, her introductory strip in which she challenges Dennis the Menace to a fight. She seems to have a fairly strong friendship with Dennis&#x27; younger sister Bea and is on talking terms with Minnie the Minx and Toots. A Diego Jourdan strip revealed Ivy has a love for horror films as she is watching Scream on her living room television.

==Physical appearance==
Ivy sports two pigtails on her jet-black messy hair and a single tooth in her mouth. Her usual apparel mainly consists of a yellow fleece jumper under red dungarees with blue play shoes. However, she has occasionally worn blue dungarees with a red fleece jumper. She appears short and stocky but in fact holds rather a lot of strength for someone so young.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Ivy appeared alongside other Beano stars in the straight-to-DVD release of &quot;The Beano Videostars&quot;. She enters the red carpet via space hopper. She was voiced by Alex Patterson.

===Theme park===
* Pictures of Ivy were posted all around Beanoland in Chessington World of Adventures before it was changed into Wild Asia in 2009.

===Other comics===
* A girl similar to Ivy appeared in a Dave the Squirrel strip in a 2011 edition of &quot;The Dandy&quot;. However, due to her mother looking different and the location change (The Dandy takes place in Dandytown rather than Beanotown) it is assumed by most to simply be a small reference by illustrator Andy Fanton.

<doc id="480562" wikidata="Q2888173" url="?curid=480562" title="Laman and Lemuel">
<text>In the Book of Mormon, Laman and Lemuel () are the two eldest sons of Lehi and the older brothers of Sam, Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph. According to the text, they lived around 600 BC. They were notable for their rebellion against Lehi and Nephi, becoming the primary antagonists of the First and Second Books of Nephi. Their descendants became known as the Lamanites and Lemuelites, while the descendants of Nephi and their other brothers became the Nephites. Disputes over the proper order of succession fueled disputes between the two peoples over the course of the Book of Mormon&#x27;s narrative. 
==Narrative==

Laman and Lemuel are introduced as the two eldest sons of the prophet Lehi and his wife Sariah, and older brothers of Sam and Nephi. When Lehi announces that the family will flee Jerusalem, Lemuel and Laman &quot;murmur&quot; as they follow their father into the wilderness. Notably, their father names a river and a valley after Laman and Lemuel, respectively. Lehi then sends the pair with their younger brothers to retrieve the brass plates from Laban. Laman attempts to retrieve them first, failing to reason with Laban and escaping to brief his brothers on the issue. The sons of Lehi make a second attempt, using luxury goods to try to bribe Laban into giving them the plates. This attempt also fails, with Laban confiscating their property and the four brothers hiding in a cave. Laman and Lemuel then attack Nephi and Sam with a &quot;rod.&quot; An angel appears, interrupting the assault. The angel indicates Nephi&#x27;s eventual stewardship of the family and affirms that there will be divine aid to retrieve the plates. Laman and Lemuel are dubious about the practicality of this as Nephi goes into Jerusalem for a third try, this time alone. Nephi returns, bearing the plates, Laban&#x27;s gear, and with Zoram in tow. Laman, Lemuel, and Sam initially do not recognize Nephi (as he is wearing Laban&#x27;s armor) and attempt to escape. In Nephi&#x27;s attempt to calm them, Zoram realizes that Nephi is not his master and has in fact killed him. Nephi extracts an oath from Zoram that he will leave Jerusalem with them. Zoram and the brothers then return to the tent of their parents.

Lehi then sends Zoram and his sons to the &quot;land of Jerusalem&quot; to retrieve Ishmael and his family. While Zoram and the sons of Lehi are escorting Ishmael&#x27;s family to Lehi&#x27;s encampment, there is a dispute that splits the party, with Laman and Lemuel taking one side and Sam and Nephi taking the other. Nephi then rebukes his brethren. Laman and Lemuel then tie up Nephi in an attempt to kill him. After praying for strength, Nephi escapes his restraints and Ishmael&#x27;s family intercedes to halt the hostilities. Eventually they return to the camp of Sariah and Lehi.

After the two families begin traveling together, Lehi has a vision of his family and what he identifies as the Tree of Life. In the dream, Laman and Lemuel refuse to join their parents, Nephi, and Sam at the tree and do not eat the fruit. Later, Laman and Lemuel ask Nephi for his interpretation of the vision. Laman, Lemuel, Zoram, Sam, and Nephi then marry the daughters of Ishmael. 

Many year pass in the wilderness. The party is guided by the Liahona which gives directions in the wilderness, particularly to such things as sources of food. When Nephi&#x27;s bow breaks, Laman and Lemuel complain with the rest of the family. After Nephi makes a new bow and returns with sufficient food, they rejoice with the company. During the wilderness travails, Ishmael dies. This leads to an attempted mutiny, headed by Laman, that subsides quickly. 

On the coast, Nephi is commanded to build a boat. Laman and Lemuel refuse to aid him until they are rebuked and smitten. While the brothers are building the vessel, Lehi and Sariah have had two more children, Jacob and Joseph. During the voyage, Laman and Lemuel assault Nephi after he rebukes them again. They refuse to untie him until a storm threatens to sink the party. After Nephi is released, the party lands in the New World.

Upon arrival, Lehi gathers his family for a farewell speech, in which he prophesies about and conditionally blesses his children and their descendants. Laman and Lemuel&#x27;s children are blessed that their descendants will remain upon the land and eventually accept the gospel. Their children are also blessed that their sins will be held to the account of their parents. Once Lehi dies, discord arises again in the new colony, leading to the departure of Nephi&#x27;s party. Laman and Lemuel and their descendants remain in the original site.

==Interpretation==
===Popular culture===
====&quot;The Book of Laman&quot;====
In 2017, BCC Press published a novel entitled &quot;The Book of Laman&quot; by Mette Ivie Harrison. The novel reframes the events of First Nephi and Second Nephi from the imagined point of view of Laman. reviewed the book as &quot;a courageous addition to the many retellings of Book of Mormon stories that dot the landscape of Mormon literature.&quot; Rebecca Bateman, in a review on the Association of Mormon Letters blog, critiqued it for issues with characterization and for anachronisms in the text.
====&quot;The Nephiad&quot;====
Michael R. Collings wrote an epic poetry adaptation of the mission to retrieve the brass plates. In an interview with William Morris, Collings acknowledged the cowardly characterization of Laman and Lemuel in the epic, attributing it both to the source text and the Miltonian style of the piece.

===River of Laman and Valley of Lemuel===
In 1 Nephi 2:2–11, Lehi&#x27;s party makes its way from Jerusalem towards the promised land. The passage also recounts the naming of a river and a valley after Laman and Lemuel. Hugh Nibley, an LDS scholar and apologist, thought this area referred to as &quot;the borders&quot; was by Jabal al-Lawz (), also known as Gebel (el-Lawz), a mountain sometimes identified with Mount Sinai although most people reject this classification.

===Proposed etymology===
&quot;Lemuel&quot; (Hebrew:לְמוּאֵל) is the name of a Biblical king mentioned in Proverbs 31, but otherwise unknown. Hugh Nibley remarked that Lemuel has a &quot;good pure Arabic name, incidentally.&quot;

<doc id="480566" wikidata="Q896997" url="?curid=480566" title="Galactic Pot-Healer">
<text>Galactic Pot-Healer is a science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick, first published in 1969. The novel deals with a number of philosophical and political issues such as repressive societies, fatalism, and the search for meaning in life.

Dick also wrote a children&#x27;s book set in the same universe, &quot;Nick and the Glimmung&quot;, in 1966. It was published posthumously in 1988.

== Plot introduction ==
The story concerns a man who thanklessly heals pots in a totalitarian future Earth, only to be summoned by a godlike alien known as Glimmung, who has recruited him as part of a multispecies specialist team sent to &quot;Plowman&#x27;s Planet&quot; (or Sirius Five) for a mystical quest, which is to raise the sunken cathedral of Heldscalla from a surreal alien ocean.

==Plot summary==
The novel opens in a dismal future America, the “Communal North American Citizen&#x27;s Republic.” The United States government has become extremely intrusive and repressive, monitoring the actions, speech and even thoughts of its citizens.

The protagonist, Joe Fernwright, is a pot-healer, one who can perfectly restore pottery to brand new condition. Joe finds himself constantly depressed and idle at the opening of the novel. He is unemployed and on a war veteran&#x27;s social security benefit, given that ceramic pottery has been replaced by plastics, and his profession is not in great demand. He longs for purpose and meaning in life. His one entertainment is to call various friends on the worldwide telephone network and swap puzzles. These puzzles are created by translating a common English proverb or phrase into another language by using a language translation computer, and then translating it back to English the same way. The object of the game is to guess the original from the double translation.

Joe finds meaning when he is summoned to &quot;Plowman&#x27;s Planet&quot;/Sirius Five by a mysterious highly evolved alien, Glimmung, with seemingly godlike powers. Along with other similarly talented but depressed and alienated people and creatures from all over the galaxy they are employed by Glimmung, in a grand endeavor to raise an ancient sunken cathedral from the ocean floor.

Glimmung is also in a struggle with the Kalends, a species gifted with precognition who are constantly writing a book that supposedly foretells the future, one which inevitably is proven right. Glimmung is determined to continue with his struggle, even when the book predicts certain failure.

At the conclusion of the book, Fernwright and his companions are offered the opportunity to join a or hive mind that also encompasses Glimmung. Fernwright and an unnamed octopoid companion alone refuse the offer. Fernwright is then given various options, such as going back to earth, going with the octopoid to its planet, going to Mali&#x27;s planet (a young humanoid female he had become romantically involved with and who chose to become a part of the collective conscious) or stay back on Sirius Five. The octopoid also suggests to him that he should start creating pots with the tools Glimmung has given him instead of just healing them. The story ends by saying the first pot he created was &#x27;awful.&#x27;

==Bibliographic information==
&quot;Galactic Pot-Healer&quot; was originally published in 1969 by Berkley Medallion Books. A hardback edition was issued in 1969 by the Science Fiction Book Club (Nelson Doubleday, Inc.). It is currently published in the United States by Vintage Books, , and in the United Kingdom by Gollancz.

An audiobook version of &quot;Galactic Pot-Healer&quot; was released in 1998 by Blackstone Audio. The audiobook is read by Tom Parker. Another version released in 2013 by Brilliance Audio, read by Phil Gigante, is unabridged and runs 6 hrs 10 minutes.</text><links>

<doc id="480568" wikidata="Q4904758" url="?curid=480568" title="Biffo the Bear">
<text>Biffo the Bear is a fictional character from the British comic magazine &quot;The Beano&quot; who stars in the comic strip of the same name, created in 1948 by Dudley D. Watkins. He was the mascot of &quot;The Beano&quot; for several decades.

==Background==
Biffo&#x27;s creator, Dudley D. Watkins, originally worked for &quot;Beano&quot;&#x27;s friendly rival &quot;The Dandy&quot;, as well as other DC Thomson children&#x27;s comics, such as &quot;Adventure&quot; in the 1920s and The Sunday Post&#x27;s &quot;Oor Wullie&quot; comic, noted by &quot;Beano&quot; creator R. D. Low for his talent of social realist humour. Watkins also participated in comic strips for &quot;The Beano&quot; as well, drawing for &quot;Lord Snooty&quot;, &quot;The White Mouse Will Get You (If You Don&#x27;t Watch Out)&quot;, and the title panels for &quot;The King&#x27;s Got a Tail!&quot;.

At the time of the development of &quot;Biffo the Bear&quot;, rumours circulated that &quot;Beano&quot; readers were losing interest in the comic strip &quot;Big Eggo&quot; (the star of the front cover and had been there since the first issue in 1938) because he was not relatable to them anymore in the same way a mammal would. &quot;Biffo the Bear&quot; debuted as cover star on the 327th issue and remained so until issue 1677.
R. D. Low preferred cover star characters to be monochrome because they would stand out in a colourful world, since the front covers of his comics were in colour. This was the same technique he used for Korky the Cat, the first cover star of &quot;The Dandy&quot;, and &quot;Big Eggo&quot;; &quot;Biffo the Bear&quot; followed suit.

==Common strips==
Many of Biffo&#x27;s stories were based on his anthropomorphism, such as owning a cafe, working as a ticket seller for camel and elephant rides at the zoo, or busking. Despite his human characteristics, Biffo barely spoke and most of the comic strip panels had no speech bubbles; human characters were either entirely mute or were the only characters with dialogue in the story.

In 1969, Lord Snooty found Biffo&#x27;s family tree at the Beanotown museum and Biffo uses it to tell stories of his family history to the readers and flashbacks would show how his ancestors interacted with famous historical events. This was written by Watkins with the help of Ian Gray.

===Buster===
In issue 575, his (then-unseen) human friend Buster appeared in his stories and had a one-off tale with Biffo in &quot;Biffo and Buster&quot;.

==Declining appearances==
When Watkins died in August 1969, David Sutherland continued the series until the 1970s, and then Jimmy Glen took over. Biffo remained as cover star until issue 1677, dethroned by &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, but appeared inside &quot;The Beano&quot; until issue 2310, however, he would have three one-off strips in the &quot;Readers&#x27; Request&quot; feature.

===Appearances outside of &quot;The Beano&quot;===
Originally one of R. D. Low&#x27;s &quot;new big five&quot; comics, but ultimately failed due to paper rationing, &quot;The Magic Comic&quot; from 1939 was revived in late-January 1976 and ended in 1979. Spin-off stories of &quot;Biffo the Bear&quot; were printed, aimed at a younger audience than &quot;The Beano&quot;, and were about Biffo visiting his nephews Cuddly and Dudley. These were written and designed by Turnbull.

Biffo was also the star of pocket-sized &quot;Twinkle&quot; books in the 1980s, drawn by Bill Ritchie.

===Revival===
The series (retitled &quot;Biffo&quot;) returned in issue 2445, drawn by Sid Burgon, and finished in issue 2954. The format had been revamped to three or four frames over a page with no speech, often depicting Biffo in fantastical, surreal situations. Some stories were reprinted in 2007 in the Fun Size Comics section.

Trevor Metcalfe contributed a few stories as well, including in &quot;The Beano Book 1994&quot;. In &quot;The Beano Book 1999&quot;, Milly O&#x27;Naire from &quot;Jackpot&quot; made a guest appearance with her father, most likely a nod to Burgon&#x27;s previous work on her comic strip.

==Cameos==
Biffo was seen in a four-part special leading a group of retired characters, Pansy Potter, Keyhole Kate and Desert Island Dick, to return &quot;The Beano&quot; to an earlier form (specifically, the 1960s, the logo from that era was used in the story).

Biffo returned in &quot;The Beano&quot; 2007 Christmas special; he featured in &#x27;The Riot Squad&#x27;. His next guest appearance was in the 70 Years Anniversary &quot;Beano&quot;, drawn by David Sutherland. As the issue was edited by Nick Park (creator of Wallace and Gromit), animals in the zoo could be seen that bore a close resemblance to that of his 1989 short film &quot;Creature Comforts&quot;. Biffo also made an appearance in the &quot;2010 Beano Annual&quot;, also drawn by Sutherland.

In 2013 Biffo appeared in the Funsize Funnies pages of &quot;The Beano&quot;. Initially drawn by Wayne Thompson, he returned the following year, this time drawn by Paul Palmer. It continued through to the 80th anniversary in 2018 along with &quot;Big Eggo&quot;. Biffo also appeared in the &quot;2019 Beano Annual&quot; in the inner cover artwork with 254 other characters from &quot;The Beano&quot;&#x27;s history and was in the time-travelling comic feature &quot;Doctor Whoops!&quot;

<text>Mixed pickles are pickles made from a variety of vegetables mixed in the same pickling process. Mixed pickles are eaten much like other pickles: in small amounts to add flavor and to accent a meal. Mixed pickles appear in many different world cuisines. 

In U.S. cuisine, a mixed pickle consists of vegetables and botanical fruits typically including cucumbers, cauliflower, cut large onions, and bell peppers, as well as spices like garlic, dill, allspice, and chili peppers, suspended in vinegar. Mixed pickles may also be categorized as sweet or sour depending on the addition of a sweetening agent like sugar.

In British cuisine, mixed pickles typically include small whole onions, gherkins, and cauliflower. Some specific kinds of British mixed pickle are Branston pickle (more properly termed a relish), and piccalilli (the latter also found in U.S. cuisine).

In Indian cuisine, a mixed Indian pickle is more likely to contain fruits (for example, mangos and limes) as well as vegetables. Indian pickle is prepared using oil unlike Western pickles, and is more likely to use lemon juice or some other acid as a souring agent instead of vinegar. Spices and ingredients vary from region to region.

Recipes for mixed pickles can also be found in Chinese cuisine, Middle Eastern cuisine, and many other world cuisines.

<doc id="480573" wikidata="Q5347305" url="?curid=480573" title="Asplenium">
<text>Asplenium is a genus of about 700 species of ferns, often treated as the only genus in the family Aspleniaceae, though other authors consider &quot;Hymenasplenium&quot; separate, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, a different chromosome count, and structural differences in the rhizomes. The type species for the genus is &quot;Asplenium marinum&quot;.

The most common vernacular name is spleenworts, applied to the more &quot;typical&quot; species. &quot;A. nidus&quot; and several similar species are called [[bird&#x27;s-nest fern]]s, the &quot;Camptosorus&quot; group is known as [[walking fern]]s, and distinct names are applied to some other particularly well-known species.

== Etymology ==
From New Latin &quot;asplenium&quot; (“spleenworts”), Linnaeus&#x27;s adjustment of Latin &quot;asplenon&quot; (“spleenwort”), from Ancient Greek ἄσπληνον (&quot;ásplēnon&quot;, “spleenwort”), from ἀ- (&quot;a-&quot;, “un-”) + σπλήν (&quot;splḗn&quot;, “spleen”) + -ον (&quot;-on&quot;, “-um”), from its use to cure anthrax in livestock.

==Taxonomy and genetics==
Many groups of species have been separated from &quot;Asplenium&quot; as segregate genera. These include &quot;Camptosorus&quot;, &quot;Ceterach&quot;, &quot;Phyllitis&quot;, and &quot;Tarachia&quot;, but these species can form hybrids with other &quot;Asplenium&quot; species and because of this are usually included in a more broadly defined &quot;Asplenium&quot;.

Some of the older classifications elevate the Aspleniaceae to the taxonomic rank of order as Aspleniales. The newer classifications place it in the subordinal group called eupolypods within the order Polypodiales. Within the eupolypods, Aspleniaceae belongs to a clade informally and provisionally known as eupolypods II.

It has been found that in some species, the chloroplast genome has evolved in complex and highly unusual ways. This makes standard cladistic analyses unsuited to resolve the phylogeny of that particular group of ferns, and even very sophisticated computational phylogenetics methods yield little information. In addition to hybridization running rampant in parts of this genus, there are also some species like the mother spleenwort (&quot;A. bulbiferum&quot;) or &quot;A. viviparum&quot; which mainly reproduce asexually, essentially cloning themselves over and over again. While most are diploid or tetraploid, some species (e.g. &quot;A. shuttleworthianum&quot;) are octoploid.

==Uses==
Both the scientific name and the common name &quot;spleenwort&quot; are derived from an old belief, based on the doctrine of signatures, that the fern was useful for ailments of the spleen, due to the spleen-shaped sori on the backs of the fronds. &quot;-wort&quot; is an ancient English term that simply means &quot;plant&quot; (compare German &quot;-wurz&quot;). The plants were thought to cause infertility in women.

Vitruvius relates the story of the name thus:

... certain pastures in Crete, on each side of the river Pothereus, which separates the two Cretan states of Gnosus and Gortyna. There are cattle at pasture on the right and left banks of that river, but while the cattle that feed near Gnosus have the usual spleen, those on the other side near Gortyna have no perceptible spleen. On investigating the subject, physicians discovered on this side a kind of herb which the cattle chew and thus make their spleen small. The herb is therefore gathered and used as a medicine for the cure of splenetic people. The Cretans call it ἄσπληνον.

A few of these ferns have some economic importance in the horticulture trade. The bird&#x27;s-nest ferns (&quot;A. nidus&quot; and several very similar, closely related species) are commonly found for sale as a house plant. The Australian mother spleenwort (&quot;A. bulbiferum&quot;) is sometimes available at greenhouses, and is of interest, along with the related &quot;A. viviparum&quot;, for the many small bulblets borne on the fronds that may grow into new plants. This characteristic is also shared with the eastern North American walking fern (&quot;A. rhizophyllum&quot;) and several Mexican species including &quot;A. palmeri&quot;. The ebony spleenwort &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; is also sometimes sold in nurseries as a hardy plant. However, many spleenworts are epipetric or epiphytic and difficult to cultivate.

&quot;Asplenium&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Batrachedra bedelliella&quot; which feeds exclusively on &quot;A. nidus&quot;. For diseases of &quot;Asplenium&quot;, see List of foliage plant diseases (Polypodiaceae).

<text>Big Eggo was a British comic strip series about an eponymous ostrich, published in the British comic magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. He first appeared in issue 1, dated 30 July 1938, and was the first cover star. His first words in the strip were &quot;Somebody&#x27;s taken my egg again!&quot; It was drawn throughout by Reg Carter.

==Background==
When creating a new comic in his &quot;big five&quot; series, R. D. Low wrote a newspaper advert in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; for new artists. He was certain that his new character would be a black-and-white animal which would stand out in a colourful world; an idea he similarly used for Korky the Cat in &quot;The Dandy&quot;. Reg Carter (who had originally published Mickey Mouse comics throughout the 1930s) responded in January 1938 with a few ideas and sketches. Carter and Low&#x27;s eventual idea would be an ostrich that misplaced his eggs. In an exchange of letters, they planned to name him Oswald the Ostrich, but eventual editor George Moonie suggested the name should be changed to &quot;Big Eggo&quot;. The ostrich became the first front cover star of the comic until he was replaced in 1948 by Biffo the Bear.

==Common plots==
The majority of Eggo&#x27;s tales were about him looking for an egg he had misplaced, which would lead to a situation in which he would either discover that the egg was not an ostrich egg; in one story, he stole an egg from a zoo and a penguin hatched out and another was about a monkey stealing his egg and replacing it with a crocodile egg.

Other stories would have him in a wacky situation, such as eating an alarm clock which alerts a fire station he walks past, or another where Eggo is caught in a hot air balloon after trying to stop a goat from eating the anchor rope. In some stories, he was also a zookeeper, and there were the stories in which he would be acting anthropromorphic, such as dog sledding, shopping, or walking pigs on a lead as if they were his pets.

==Declining appearances==
When Biffo the Bear took over as the cover star, Big Eggo would appear on the front cover&#x27;s masthead, but would appear inside &quot;The Beano&quot; with the other comics, such as &quot;Lord Snooty&quot; and &quot;Pansy Potter&quot;. In World War II, rationing forced comics to stop being published too frequently; &quot;The Beano&quot; would publish fortnightly until the end of the 1940s. &quot;Big Eggo&quot;, like many Beano strips, dedicated stories to encouraging young readers to help with the war effort, such as recycling paper; one story was about Big Eggo, bothered by flies, creating fly paper out of sheets covered in glue after he accidentally knocks the recycling into some glue baths. He would continue to have stories until 1949, and his front-cover masthead appearances would drop in 1954, being replaced by Dennis the Menace. The sudden disappearance of the stories was due to the death of Carter in April 1949, which was not revealed until 2008, although rumours surfaced weeks before that readers had fallen out of love with the character because he was a bird, not a mammal, and therefore did not relate to the audience, unlike Biffo, a bear. George Drysdale took over as artist for the strips after Carter&#x27;s death until the series&#x27; conclusion.

On the 7th March 2018 Big Eggo returned, illustrated by Lew Stringer, to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Beano. These comics were shorter, being 3 or 4 panels long. The strip ran throughout the year and finished when the anniversary was over.

==Cameos==
&quot;Big Eggo&quot; would begin to reappear sporadically after the character left the masthead. The next time Eggo made a cameo in the comic was for the 2000th issue celebration at the top of the cover of the first &quot;Beano&quot; reprinted on the back page, saying &quot;Ah! The good old days!&quot;.

A one-off strip called &quot;Lord Snooty&#x27;s Day Out&quot; drawn by Ken H. Harrison reveals that he is living in the Beano Retirement Home, along with Jonah, Lord Snooty and Jack Flash. Two years later, Eggo would meet Gnasher and Gnipper for the 65th anniversary.

In 2006, Big Eggo was used as a villain for a feature-length &quot;Bash Street Kids&quot; story illustrated and written by Kev F. Sutherland. The story featured him and other discontinued &quot;Beano&quot; characters wanting to revert the magazine back to when they were popular, but the Class 2B accidentally thwart the plan with the help of &quot;The Dandy&quot; Keyhole Kate accidentally building a robot with the brain of Jonah.

He also made a surprise return to the Beano in issue 3925 in a three-panel strip for the start of a new miniseries, written and drawn by Lew Stringer, to tie in with the comic&#x27;s 80th anniversary, which continued for 24 more issues until September. In one, he was joined by Blotty and &#x27;Enry. He was also the only character from the first generation to appear on the front cover of the 2019 Beano Annual; his first story&#x27;s gag was re-enacted on the back cover with Gnasher handing Walter a crocodile egg that hatches with the baby biting Walter&#x27;s bottom. He appeared in the inner cover artwork with 254 other characters from The Beano&#x27;s history and was in the time-travelling comic feature &quot;Doctor Whoops!&quot;

<text>The Jaredites () are one of four peoples (along with the Nephites, Lamanites, and Mulekites) that the Latter-day Saints believe settled in ancient America.

The Book of Mormon (mainly its Book of Ether) describes the Jaredites as the descendants of Jared and his brother, who lived at the time of the Tower of Babel. According to the Book of Mormon, they fled across the ocean on unique barges and established an ancient civilization in America.

Mainstream archaeology has found no evidence of the existence of Jaredites or any of the other three groups.

==Book of Ether==
According to the Book of Mormon, the Jaredites are the descendants of Jared, his brother, their immediate family, and their friends. (Joseph Smith later identified the brother of Jared as Mahonri Moriancumer.) At the time of the Tower of Babel, when the tongues of all nations were confounded, the Lord acceded to the desires of Jared, and his people&#x27;s language was not confounded. The people were also granted a land of promise.

The Lord guided the people through the wilderness and were eventually directed to cross the sea in &quot;barges&quot;. The vessels were sealed and watertight and able to be swamped by waves without sinking. Air was obtained from outside the vessels, as needed. They also brought with them animals and food. The recorded length of the miraculous trip was 344 days. Among other things they carried in their voyage were honeybees, which, in the language of the Jaredites were called &quot;deseret&quot;. Additionally, they brought seeds. 

Ether is the last in the royal line that began with one of the sons of Jared. From the time of the first king to the destruction of the Jaredites, there were only occasional periods of peace and prosperity. The times of peace were interrupted by intrigue over the throne, civil war, and the accession of wicked kings. The history of the Jaredites confirmed the fears of Jared and his brother that a monarchy would lead to evil.

The Book of Mormon claims that the Jaredites grew to become a civilization that exceeded two million people just before its destruction. They finally destroyed themselves about the time Lehi and the other refugees from Jerusalem arrived in America. A prophecy of Ether was fulfilled: the last Jaredite king, Coriantumr, lived to see both the total destruction of his entire house, the scattering of the remaining Jaredites, and the arrival of another people to inherit the land.

===Other references in Book of Mormon===
Outside the Book of Ether, the Book of Mormon relates that Coriantumr was found by the Mulekites. The Nephites later encountered the Mulekites and taught them the Nephite language. The Mulekites told them that Coriantumr had died some nine months after he had come to live with them. The Nephite prophet King Mosiah I was able to translate a large stone with engravings that gave an account of Coriantumr. Another record on twenty-four plates, discovered by the people of King Limhi, was translated by the Nephite King Mosiah II. An abridged account of the Jaredite records was later included by Moroni, as the Book of Ether, in the Book of Mormon.

==Geography==
The ocean crossed is not specified in the Book of Mormon. Hugh Nibley&#x27;s &quot;There were Jaredites&quot; and &quot;The World of the Jaredites&quot; argue for the Pacific Ocean, but Milton R. Hunter argues for the Atlantic Ocean.

The location of the Jaredite civilization is also not specified in the Book of Mormon except that it was north of a narrow neck of land in what was called the &quot;Land Northward&quot; by the Nephites. The New World location of the Jaredites and Nephites is a subject of disagreement among Mormons. Joseph Smith indicated that the Jaredites arrived in &quot;the lake country of America&quot; and that &quot;the Nephites... lived about the narrow neck of land, which now embraces Central America, with all the cities that can be found.&quot;

==Proposed relations==

===Descendants of Ham===
Some early Latter Day Saints, including Apostle Parley P. Pratt believed the Jaredites were descendants of Ham, based on the group&#x27;s origins near the Tower of Babel, and initial migration into the Valley of Nimrod, an area associated with the descendants of Ham.

===Olmecs===
Some Mormon have argued for substantial parallels between the Jaredites and the Olmecs. For example, one scholar asserted that the writings of an ancient Native American historian, Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl, wrote about a group of people who came from the great tower to Mesoamerica. Ixtlilxochitl wrote that the people lived in an area in the northern parts of the land, along the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Other LDS researchers, such as W. Vincent Coon, point to native legends and suggest that the earliest immigrants to Central America migrated by land and boat from &quot;northern America&quot;. Phyllis Carol Olive compares Jaredite civilization to ancient cultures of the Great Lakes region.

<text>Grandpa was a British comic strip which originally appeared in the magazine &quot;The Beano&quot; from 1955 to 1957, drawn by Ken Reid. It was later revived from 1971 until 1984, but this time by Robert Nixon and afterwards Jimmy Glen.

==Background==

&quot;Grandpa&quot; was first published in issue 680, illustrated by Ken Reid. It was a gag-a-day comic about a mischievous old bearded man. 

Some of the stories involved his dad, an even older man with an even longer beard than him. Despite their advanced ages, they enjoyed a father-son relationship similar to that of Dennis the Menace and his dad; a typical story would be about Grandpa getting involved in some kind of mischief, being caught by his father and ending up getting a spanking. In a June 1956 strip, Grandpa was revealed to have been born in 1874, making his age 82. In 1957 the series was terminated.

From 1971 until 1984 &quot;Grandpa&quot; was relaunched. Robert Nixon drew it for the first years, after which Jimmy Glen took over until 1984. This series ran from issue 1522 to issue 2200.

Recently in &quot;The Beano&quot;, Grandpa briefly in &quot;Funsize Funnies&quot;, illustrated by Steve Beckett.

<text>Baby Face Finlayson is a fictional character in a comic strip in the UK comic &quot;The Beano&quot;, first appearing in issue 1553, dated 22 April 1972. Baby Face Finlayson &quot;The Cutest Bandit in the West&quot; is an outlaw from the American Old West, and is, in fact, a baby.

His name is derived from the real-life American gangster of the 1930s Baby Face Nelson (real name Lester Joseph Gillis).

== Publication history ==
He was originally a minor character in Little Plum, but was later given a spin-off strip of his own. He rode around in a motorised pram, stealing everything that wasn&#x27;t tied down, whilst shouting &quot;Yuk Yuk!&quot;. He had a number of accomplices, including Jessie James, Sid the Kid and Goo Goo McGoo who were also, apparently, babies. Their chief nemesis was Sheriff &quot;Marsh&quot; Mallow of Cactus Gulch.

When the strip returned in 1980, the Wild West theme was dropped, and the setting was moved to England. The tagline was also changed to &quot;The Cutest Bandit Around&quot;. However, in the final strip of the second series, he was posted back to America by the angry Beano editor, whom Baby-Face had tried to kidnap. On both occasions, the strip was drawn by Ron Spencer.

== Subsequent appearances ==
In issue 3181, dated 5 July 2003, he cameoed in a Little Plum strip, when he stole Little Plum&#x27;s wigwam. He sped off in his pram, crashed into a buffalo so Little Plum thought he had learned his lesson, until he steals Little Plum&#x27;s clothes without him noticing and rides off. In September 2004 he reappeared again for five weeks in his own strip, this time drawn by Emilios Hatjoullis. He has appeared in the Beano Annual every year since then. In 2006 Baby Face returned as a villainous gangster in the Bash Street Kids adventures &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; and &quot;Hot Rod Cow&quot;, written and drawn by Kev F Sutherland. He appears in the 2008 Beano annual in the story &quot;Pluggy Love&quot;, where Danny believes that Plug&#x27;s girlfriend is evil as he thinks Baby-Face is her father. It turns out she&#x27;s his babysitter and her father was pushing his pram. He appeared once again in the 2009 annual in &quot;Reservoir Dodge&quot;, where after discovering a Weather-Predicting device Roger and Walter sold him is fake, he tries to kill them and invites a group of other fictional villains over, like the Joker, a Dalek, a devil, and Bully Beef. Other Beano characters try to help Roger, but are also placed above the piranha fish tank. However Alexander the Lemming and Winston the Cat push the tank over, forcing the villains away.

Baby-Face Finlayson returned to &quot;The Beano&quot; in the Funsize Funnies in #3660 drawn by Alexander Matthews.

<doc id="480586" wikidata="Q233608" url="?curid=480586" title="Tarpan">
<text>The tarpan (Equus ferus ferus) was a free-ranging horse population of the Eurasian steppe from the 18th to the 20th century. What qualifies as a tarpan is subject to debate; it is unclear whether tarpans were genuine wild horses, feral domestic horses or hybrids. The last individual believed to be a tarpan died in captivity in the Russian Empire in 1909.

Beginning in the 1930s, several attempts were made to develop horses that looked like tarpans through selective breeding, called &quot;breeding back&quot; by advocates. The breeds that resulted included the Heck horse, the , and a derivation of the Konik breed, all of which have a primitive appearance, particularly in having the grullo coat colour. Some of these horses are now commercially promoted as &quot;tarpans&quot;, although such animals are only domestic breeds and not the wild animal themselves.

==Name and etymology==
The name &quot;tarpan&quot; or &quot;tarpani&quot; derives from a Turkic language (Kazakh or Kyrgyz) name meaning &quot;wild horse&quot;. The Tatars and the Cossacks distinguished the wild horse from the feral horse; the latter was called &quot;Takja&quot; or &quot;Muzin&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The tarpan was first described by Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin in 1771; he had seen the animals in 1769 in the district of Bobrov, near Voronezh. In 1784, Pieter Boddaert named the species &quot;Equus ferus&quot;, referring to Gmelin&#x27;s description. Unaware of Boddaert&#x27;s name, Otto Antonius published the name &quot;Equus gmelini&quot; in 1912, again referring to Gmelin&#x27;s description. Since Antonius&#x27; name refers to the same description as Boddaert&#x27;s it is a junior objective synonym. It is now thought that the domesticated horse, named &quot;Equus caballus&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, is descended from the tarpan; indeed, many taxonomists consider them to belong to the same species. By a strict application of the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the tarpan ought to be named &quot;E. caballus&quot;, or if considered a subspecies, &quot;E. caballus ferus&quot;. However, biologists have generally ignored the letter of the rule and used &quot;E. ferus&quot; for the tarpan to avoid confusion with the domesticated subspecies.

It is debated if the small, free-roaming horses seen in the Russian steppes during 18th and 19th centuries and called &quot;tarpan&quot; were indeed wild, never-domesticated horses, hybrids of the Przewalski&#x27;s horse and local domestic animals, or simply feral horses. Most studies have been based on only two preserved specimens and research to date has not positively linked the tarpan to Pleistocene or Holocene-era animals.

In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature &quot;conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are predated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms&quot;, confirming &quot;E. ferus&quot; for the undomesticated wild horse. Taxonomists who consider the domestic horse a subspecies of the wild horse should use &quot;Equus ferus caballus&quot;; the name &quot;Equus caballus&quot; remains available for the domestic horse where it is considered to be a separate species.

== Appearance ==
Traditionally, two tarpan subtypes have been proposed, the forest tarpan and steppe tarpan, although there seem to be only minor differences in type. The general view is that there was only one subspecies, the tarpan, &quot;Equus ferus ferus&quot;. The last individual, which died in captivity in 1909, was between tall at the shoulders, and had a thick, falling mane, a grullo coat colour, dark legs, and primitive markings, including a dorsal stripe and shoulder stripes.

A number of coat colour genotypes have been identified within European wild horses from the Pleistocene and Holocene: those creating bay, black and leopard complex are known from the wild horse population in Europe and were depicted in cave paintings of wild horses during the Pleistocene. The dun gene, a dilution gene seen in Przewalski&#x27;s horse that also creates the grullo or &quot;blue dun&quot; coat seen in the Konik, has not yet been studied in European wild horses. It is likely that at least some wild horses had a dun coat.

Historical reports are ambiguous on whether tarpans had standing manes like wild equines, or falling manes like domestic horses.

The appearance of European wild horses may be reconstructed with genetic, osteologic and historic data. One genetic study suggests that bay was the predominant colour in European wild horses. During the Mesolithic, a gene coding a black coat colour appeared on the Iberian peninsula. This colour spread east but was less common than bay in the investigated sample and never reached Siberia. Bay in combination with dun results in the &quot;bay dun&quot; colour seen in Przewalski&#x27;s horses; black with dun creates the grullo coat. A loss of the dun dilution may have been advantageous in more forested western European landscapes, as dark colours were a better camouflage in forests. Pangaré or &quot;mealy&quot; coloration, a characteristic of other wild equines, might have been present in at least some European wild horses, as historic accounts report a light belly.

Historic references report that most tarpans were black dun (grullo, &quot;blue dun&quot;) colour. Some black individuals were reported to have domestic colours like white or grey legs. Authors, such as Peter Pallas, believed tarpans to be escaped farm horses.

==History==
Wild horses have been present in Europe since the Pleistocene and ranged from southern France and Spain east to central Russia. There are cave drawings of primitive predomestication horses at Lascaux, France and in Cave of Altamira, Spain, as well as artifacts believed to show the species in southern Russian empire, where a horse of this type was domesticated around 3000 BC. &quot;Equus ferus&quot; had a continuous range from western Europe to Alaska; historic material suggests wild horses lived in most parts of Holocene continental Europe and the Eurasian steppe, except for parts of Scandinavia, Iceland and Ireland.

===DNA===
DNA obtained from a &quot;tarpan&quot; that lived in the steppes of the Kherson region during the mid-19th century shows its ancestry to be a mixture between horses native to Europe and found with the Corded Ware Culture, and horses closely related to the DOM2 population, the ancestors of modern domestic horses. (DOM2 horses originated from the Western Eurasia steppes, especially the lower Volga-Don, but not in Anatolia, during the late fourth and early third millennia BCE. Their genes may show selection for easier domestication and stronger backs). This is not consistent with tarpans as the wild ancestor of, or a feral version of, DOM2. Nor is the tarpan a hybrid with Przewalski&#x27;s horses.

===Forest tarpan===
The &quot;forest horse&quot; or &quot;forest tarpan&quot; was a hypothesis of various 20th-century natural scientists, including Tadeusz Vetulani, who suggested that the continuous forestation of Europe after the last ice age created forest-adapted subtype of the wild horse, which he named &quot;Equus sylvestris.&quot; However, historic references do not describe any major difference between the populations, and therefore most authors assume there was only one subspecies of western Eurasian wild horse, &quot;Equus ferus ferus.&quot;

Nevertheless, a stocky type of horse living in forests and highlands was described during the 19th century in Spain, the Pyrenees, the Camargue, the Ardennes, Great Britain, and the southern Swedish upland.
They had a robust head and strong body, and a long frizzy mane. The colour was described as faint brown or yellowish brown with eel stripe and leg stripes, or wholly black legs. The flanks and shoulders were spotted, some of them tended to an ashy colour. They dwelled in rocky habitats and showed intelligent and fierce behaviour. Yet, those horses were never colloquially called &quot;tarpans&quot;.

Black wild horses were found in Dutch swamps, with a large skull, small eyes, and a bristly muzzle. Their mane was full, with broad hooves, and curly hair. However, it is possible that these were feral and not wild horses.
Herodotus described light-coloured wild horses in an area now part of Ukraine in the 5th century BCE. In the 12th century, Albertus Magnus stated that mouse-coloured wild horses with a dark eel stripe lived in the German territory, and in Denmark, large herds were hunted.

===16th century free-ranging horses in Europe===

Wild horses still were common in the east of Prussia during the 15th and early 16th centuries. During the 16th century, wild horses disappeared from most of the mainland of western Europe and became less common in eastern Europe as well. Belsazar Hacquet saw wild horses in the Polish zoo in Zamość during the Seven Years&#x27; War. According to him, those wild horses were of small body size, had a blackish brown colour, a large and thick head, short dark manes and tail hair, and a &quot;beard&quot;. They were absolutely untameable and defended themselves harshly against predators.

Kajetan Kozmian visited the population at Zamość as well and reported that they were small and strong, had robust limbs and a consistently dark mouse colour. Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin witnessed herds in Voronezh in 1768. Those horses were described as very fast and shy, fleeing at any noise, and as small, with small, pinned ears and a short frizzly mane. The tail was shorter than in domestic horses. They were typically mouse-coloured with a light belly and legs becoming black, although grey and white horses were mentioned as well. The coat was long and dense. The horses at Zamosc were never called &quot;tarpan&quot; back in their lifetime.

Peter Simon Pallas witnessed possible tarpans in the same year in southern Russia. He thought they were feral animals that escaped during the confusions of wars. These herds were important game of the Tatars and numbered between 5 and 20 animals. The horses he described had a small body, large and thick heads, short frizzly manes and short tail hair, as well as pinned ears. The colour was described as faint brownish, sometimes brown or black. He also reported of obvious domestic hybrids with light-coloured legs or grey coats.

===The tarpans of 18th century Europe===
&quot;The Natural History of Horses&quot; by 19th-century author Charles Hamilton Smith also described tarpans. According to Smith, the herds of free-ranging horses numbered from a few to hundred individuals. They often were mixed with domestic horses, and alongside pure herds there were herds of feral horses or hybrids. The colour of alleged pure tarpans was described as consistently brown, cream-coloured or mouse-coloured. The short frizzy mane was reported to be black, as were the tail and legs. The ears were of varying size, but set high on the skull. The eyes were small.

According to Smith, tarpans made stronger sounds than domestic horses and the overall appearance of these horses was mule-like.

==Extinction==
The human-caused extinction of wild horses in Europe began in Southern Europe, possibly in antiquity. While humans had been hunting wild horses since the Paleolithic, during historic times horse meat was an important source of protein for many cultures. As large herbivores, the range of the tarpan was continuously decreased by the increasing human population of the Eurasian landmass. Wild horses were further targeted because they caused damage to hay stores and often took domestic mares from pastures. Furthermore, interbreeding with wild horses was an economic loss for farmers since the foals of such matings were intractable.

Tarpans lived in the southern parts of the steppe. In 1879 the last scientifically confirmed individual was killed. After that, only dubious sightings were documented. As the tarpan horse died out in the wild between 1875 and 1890, the last free-ranging mare considered a tarpan was accidentally killed during an attempt at capture. The last captive tarpan died in 1909 in a Ukrainian zoo in the Russian empire.

The horses at Zamosc survived until 1806, when they were allegedly donated to local farmers of Poland and bred to their horses. The Konik is claimed to descend from these hybrid horses, as recent research has highlighted a significant degree of anatomic difference between free-roaming Konik in the Netherlands and other modern domesticated horses.

==Tarpans interbreeding with domestic horses ==

The oldest archaeological evidence for domesticated horses is from Kazakhstan and Ukraine between 6,000 and 5,500 YBP (years before present). The diverse mitochondrial DNA of domestic horses contrasts sharply with the very low diversity of the Y chromosome; that suggests that many mares but only a few stallions were used, and local use of wild mares or even secondary sites of domestication are likely. Therefore, the European wild horse may well have contributed to the domestic horse.

===Wild horses vs. feral horses===
Some researchers consider the tarpans to be mixed wild and feral population or completely feral horses. Few consider the more recent animals historically called &quot;tarpans&quot; to be genuine wild horses without domestic influence. Historic references to &quot;wild horses&quot; may actually refer to feral domestic horses or hybrids.

Some 19th century authors wrote that local &quot;wild&quot; horses had hoof problems that led to crippled legs; therefore, they assumed these were feral horses. Other contemporary authors claimed all &quot;wild&quot; horses between the Volga River and the Ural were actually feral. However, others thought that this was too speculative and assumed that wild, undomesticated horses still lived into the 19th century. Domestic horses used in warfare often were turned loose when they were no longer needed. Also, remaining wild stallions could steal domestic mares. There are some accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries of wild herds with typical wild horse features such as large heads, pinned ears, short frizzy mane and tail, but mentioned animals with domestic influence as well.
The only known individual to be photographed was the so-called Cherson tarpan, which was caught as a foal near Novovorontsovka in 1866. It died in 1887 in the Moscow Zoo. The nature of this horse was dubious in its lifetime, because it showed almost none of the wild horse features described in the historic sources. In 2021, a study found that the so-called &#x27;Shatilov&#x27; tarpan, a museum specimen from the Kherson region of the Pontic–Caspian steppe that died in 1868, was a hybrid between two horse lineages, with two thirds of its genetics representing the same ancestral lineage as modern horses, and the remaining third related to a distinct lineage of European horses found at an archaeological site associated with the late-Neolithic Corded Ware culture.

===Breeding back the tarpan===
Three attempts have been made to use selective breeding to create a type of horse that resembles the tarpan phenotype, though recreating an extinct subspecies is not genetically possible with current technology. In 1936, Polish university professor Tadeusz Vetulani selected Polish farm horses that were formerly known as Panje horses (now called Konik) and that he believed resembled the historic tarpan and started a selective breeding program. Although his breeding attempt is well known, it made only a minor contribution to the modern Konik stock, which clusters genetically with other domestic horse breeds, including those as diverse as the Mongolian horse and the Thoroughbred.

In the early 1930s, Berlin Zoo Director Lutz Heck and Heinz Heck of the Munich Zoo began a program crossbreeding Koniks with Przewalski horse stallions, and the mares of Gotland ponies, and Icelandic horses. By the 1960s they produced the Heck horse. In the mid-1960s, Harry Hegard started a similar program in the United States using mustangs and local working ranch horses that has resulted in the Hegardt or Stroebel&#x27;s horse.

===Assessment===
While all three breeds have a primitive look that resembles the tarpan in some respects, they are not genetically tarpans and the wild, predomestic European horse remains extinct. However, this does not prevent some modern breeders from marketing horses with these features as a &quot;tarpan&quot;.

In spite of sharing primitive external features, the Konik and Hucul horses have markedly different conformation with differently proportioned body measurements, thought in part to be linked to living in different habitats.

Other breeds sometimes alleged to be surviving wild horses include the Exmoor pony and the Dülmen pony. However, genetic studies do not set any of these breeds apart from other domestic horses. On the other hand, there has not yet been a study comparing domestic breeds directly with the European wild horse.

<doc id="480587" wikidata="Q5531988" url="?curid=480587" title="General Jumbo">
<text>General Jumbo is a British adventure story character from the comic magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. He starred in the eponymous adventure story series, as well as the 1971 spin-off series &quot;Admiral Jumbo&quot;, and was illustrated by a variety of &quot;Beano&quot; usual illustrators, including Paddy Brennan. Jumbo is a well-known &quot;Beano&quot; character with numerous references in popular culture, and was the last character to have an adventure stories series.

== Synopsis ==
Alfie Johnson is a 12-year-old boy playing football with his friends when their ball flies over a nearby wall. When Johnson retrieves it, Professor Carter&#x27;s remote control model army attacks him. He and the professor bond after he saves Carter from being killed in a potential bus accident, so Carter shows his gratitude by giving him the models, which Johnson uses to play pretend and solve crimes.

Johnson (nicknamed &quot;Jumbo&quot; by his friends) is a pudgy boy who is usually shown wearing an army general cap with a mock general uniform: a shirt and tie, as well as his shorts, long socks and shoes. He is based in Dinchester.

==Publication history==
=== Official stories ===
The &quot;General Jumbo&quot; series debuted in issue 584 with artwork by Irish DC Thomson artist Paddy Brennan. He drew for the first series and the third, his last story appearing in issue 1073. Dave Sutherland took over the third series, and drew for the fourth and fifth, which ended in issue 1271. John Nichol drew for series two (issues 732 to 739) and Sandy Calder drew the rest, as well as the stories from &quot;Admiral Jumbo&quot; (1971).

Jumbo&#x27;s stories were episodic, like some stories of &quot;Beano&quot; adventure genre. Each story was about him problem solving, playing pretend, rescuing people or catching criminals, all successful with the help of Carter&#x27;s giant sets of model army figures. &quot;Admiral Jumbo&quot; was a short-lived spin-off where Carter unveils Jumbo&#x27;s new navy.

=== Subsequent appearances ===
==== &quot;The Beano&quot; ====
Although Jumbo&#x27;s stories discontinued in the 1970s, his &quot;painting&quot; would feature in issue 2000&#x27;s Hall of Fame, and he would reappear in issue 2924 in 1998 for &quot;The Beano&quot; 60th-birthday issue. Jumbo&#x27;s stories appeared frequently in other &quot;Beano&quot; media, notably having stories in every &quot;Beano Annual&quot; from 1990 to 2006, as well as having frequent &quot;Annual&quot; stories in every decade except the 1980s. 2008&#x27;s edition revealed him as the antagonist of &quot;Billy the Cat&quot; three-part adventure story, the plot twist revealing one of his army models, Private Pike, had become sentient and was mind-controlling him. The saga would continue in the following annual in a &quot;General Jumbo&quot; story where Pike (disguised as a teddy bear) plans his revenge as Jumbo attends a fête. He joined 254 other &quot;Beano&quot; characters in the double-page spread of 2019&#x27;s &quot;Annual&quot; to celebrate the 80th anniversary, and also made a notable appearance in 2005&#x27;s &quot;Beano Action Special&quot; alongside Tim Henman and Roger Federer.

==== DC Thomson ====
He also appeared in &quot;Nutty&quot; in the early 1980s, reprints of stories originally from his &quot;Beano&quot; appearances. &quot;The Dandy&quot; featured him in issue 2381 as part of a series where readers were allowed to choose certain &quot;Beano&quot; characters to have short stories between November 1986 and March 1988.

== Reception and legacy ==
Jumbo became &quot;The Beano&quot; last adventure story character, ending the adventure story genre for good in`1975 and making issue 1735 the first &quot;Beano&quot; magazine to contain comic strips. He was extremely popular, noted by having seven series to his name without reprinted stories, and a lot of fan mail from the readers praised the character for his entertaining episodes. Although General Jumbo was the nickname of Henry Maitland Wilson, it has not been revealed whether Jumbo&#x27;s nickname is a reference to this. A &quot;General Jumbo&quot; series appeared in &quot;Buddy&quot; magazine in the early 1980s, but starring Jimmy &quot;Jumbo&quot; Johnson.

===Influence on other strips===

&quot;General Jumbo&quot; appears to be the inspiration of several other strips and characters in British comics, including:
* &quot;The Toys of Doom&quot; (&quot;Buster&quot;, 1965–1968) — Criminal scientist Doctor Droll escapes from Garstone Prison with the aid of an army of remote-controlled mechanical toys he has constructed.
* &quot;The House of Dolmann&quot; (&quot;Valiant&quot;, 1966–1970) — crime-fighting inventor Eric Dolmann creates a roster of remote-controlled robots that looked like puppets, each with special abilities, and uses them to combat crime where he finds it
* The parodies &quot;Drill-Sergeant Jumbo&quot; and &quot;Danny&#x27;s District Council&quot; in &quot;Viz&quot; (from 1979)
* Colonel Tusker, killed by the Fury in Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Captain Britain&quot; series during the &quot;Jaspers&#x27; Warp&quot; storyline (1981–1984)
* An unnamed character killed by the Lloigor in &quot;Zenith&quot;, in &quot;2000 AD&quot; (from 1987)
* General Tubbs in &quot;Jack Staff&quot;
* Colonel Liliput in Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Top 10&quot; series (1999–2001)

<text>Phantazia (Eileen Harsaw) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;X-Force&quot; #6 (1992).

==Fictional character biography==
Phantazia was recruited by Toad into his lineup of the Brotherhood of Mutants. She was one of the more powerful members of the group, possessing a mutant ability that allowed her to manipulate and disrupt not only the electronic systems and weaponry of her opponents, but their physical senses and superhuman powers as well. Her first mission with the Brotherhood led her to battle the mutant strike force called X-Force. There, she easily located the team&#x27;s hidden bunker, shut off Cable&#x27;s weaponry, and disrupted Cannonball&#x27;s blast field, allowing Sauron to stab him in the chest.

After Thornn&#x27;s defeat, Phantazia fled, leaving Masque to be killed by Shatterstar. Other missions set the Brotherhood up against X-Factor, Darkhawk, Spider-Man, and Sleepwalker. Eventually, Phantazia was invited to Avalon, a mutant sanctuary, by Exodus. She rejected the offer and stayed with the Brotherhood. Pyro&#x27;s sickness was getting to him, so they stayed with the mutant Empyrean, who could ward off Pyro&#x27;s pain. The X-Men eventually found out what was going on and during the battle, Phantazia was defeated by Psylocke. After the skirmish, Phantazia departed the island with her teammates. Though the Brotherhood would make several appearances after this, she was not seen among their roster.

Phantazia was next seen in the altered reality of the 2005 &quot;House of M&quot; storyline. After the timeline was restored, she was confirmed as one of the many mutants who lost their powers on M-Day. The reality alteration leaves her in a catatonic state as she is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.

Years later, with her sanity and powers seemingly both regained, Phantazia is at Madelyne Pryor&#x27;s recently established Embassy of Limbo in Manhattan, granted sanctuary there.

==Powers and abilities==
Phantazia is a mutant who possesses the ability to sense and manipulate electromagnetic energy fields. This enables her to fly, become invisible, and disrupt the functions of machines and bioelectric energy fields, causing pain, paralysis, and loss of physical coordination.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
An alternate universe variant of Phantazia appears in &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; as a prisoner of Mister Sinister who is later killed by Dark Beast.

===House of M===
Phantazia was seen as part of Magneto&#x27;s elite guard. Phantazia was one of but a few people to remember the events of House of M, although this led to her going insane.

===No More Humans===
An alternate Earth version of Phantazia, with powers intact, assisted Raze&#x27;s Brotherhood against the X-Men.

<text>Sir Leslie Patrick Abercrombie ( ; 6 June 1879 – 23 March 1957) was an English architect, urban designer and town planner. Abercrombie was an academic during most of his career, and prepared one city plan and several regional studies prior to the Second World War. He came to prominence in the 1940s for his urban plans of the cities of Plymouth, Hull, Bath, Bournemouth, Hong Kong, Addis Ababa, Cyprus, Edinburgh, Clyde Valley and Greater London.

==Early life==
Patrick Abercrombie was born in Ashton-upon-Mersey, seventh of nine children of Sarah and William Abercrombie, a stockbroker and businessman who had wide artistic interests, particularly of the Arts and Crafts school. In 1887, the family moved to a new home in Sale, designed by a Leicester architect, Joseph Goddard, with interiors influenced by designer John Aldam Heaton. He spent a year at the Realschule in Lucerne, Switzerland.

==Career==
In 1897, he was articled to the architect Charles Heathcote, while studying at the Manchester School of Art. After four years, he started work under Arnold Thornely in Liverpool, and set up home in Birkenhead, which remained his home until 1936. After a year working in Chester with architect Philip Lockwood, son of renowned architect T.M Lockwood, in 1907 he was offered a post as junior lecturer and studio instructor at the University of Liverpool School of Architecture. In 1915 year was appointed as Lever Professor of Civic Design at Liverpool, soon becoming a nationally-known authority on town planning and the garden city movement. In 1920 he went into partnership with architect Philip Lockwood and F.C. Saxon, as Lockwood Abercrombie and Saxon, a firm which still operates in Chester as Lovelock Mitchell, one of the world&#x27;s oldest architecture firms.

He was later appointed as Professor of Town Planning at University College London, and gradually asserted his dominance as an architect of international renown, which came about through the replanning of Plymouth, Hull, Bath, Edinburgh and Bournemouth, among others. Of his post-war replanning of Plymouth, Sir Simon Jenkins has written:
:Poor Plymouth. It was badly blitzed in the Second World War and then subjected to slash and burn by its city fathers. The modern visitor will find it a maze of concrete blocks, ill-sited towers and ruthless road schemes. Most of this damage was done by one man, Patrick Abercrombie, in the 1950s. The old Barbican district would, in France or Germany, have had its façades restored or rebuilt. Here new buildings were inserted with no feeling for the texture of the old lanes and alleys.

Throughout his life, he devoted his time to civic bodies. He was a founding member of the Town Planning Institute (TPI) formed in 1914 and became its president in 1925. In the 1920s and 1930s, Abercrombie developed a specialty in regional planning. He became chairman of the Council for the Preservation of Rural England in 1926, and was on the Council of the Town and Country Planning Association.

In 1937, he served as President of the Geographical Association. His Presidential Address was entitled &#x27;Geography - the Basis of Planning&#x27;.

===Greater London planning===
He is best known for the post-Second World War replanning of London. In 1943 he created the County of London Plan, and in 1944 the Greater London Plan, together commonly referred to as the &quot;Abercrombie Plan&quot;. The latter document was an extended and more thorough product than the 1943 publication. Abercrombie conceived the Ringways scheme of London in 1944, proposing four ringroads around Greater London.

In 1945 he published &quot;A Plan for the City &amp; County of Kingston upon Hull&quot;, with the assistance of Sir Edwin Lutyens. Lutyens had died the year before publication whilst much of the plan was being finalised, and the plan was ultimately rejected by the Councillors of Hull.

===New towns movement===
From the &quot;Abercrombie Plan&quot; came the New Towns movement which included the building of Harlow and Crawley and the largest &#x27;out-county&#x27; estate, Harold Hill in north-east London. He produced the Clyde Valley Regional Plan in 1946 with Robert Matthew that proposed the new towns of East Kilbride and Cumbernauld. In 1949 he published with Richard Nickson a plan for the redevelopment of Warwick, which proposed demolition of almost all the town&#x27;s Victorian housing stock and construction of a large inner ring road.

===International projects===
During the postwar years, Abercrombie was commissioned by the British government to redesign Hong Kong, for which he submitted plans in 1947. In 1956 he was commissioned by Haile Selassie to draw up plans for the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa; he submitted the plan in 1957 but its major aspects were not carried out.

==Awards==
Abercrombie was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1945 New Year Honours. He was the most celebrated British planner of his generation. In 1946 he received the RIBA Royal Gold Medal - the highest honour awarded by the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1948 he became the first president of the newly formed group the International Union of Architects, or the UIA (Union Internationale des Architectes). The group now annually awards the Sir Patrick Abercrombie Prize, for excellence in town planning. In 1950 he received the AIA Gold Medal, the highest architectural honour in America, making him one of the few architects who have won both the prestigious RIBA Gold Medal and AIA Gold Medal, alongside renowned names such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, Frank Gehry, Richard Rogers, and Norman Foster.

==Legacy==
The Abercrombie Building at Oxford Brookes University is home to the Faculty of Technology, Design and Environment. He appears in the film &quot;The Proud City&quot; presenting his plan to the public.

He died in 1957. A blue plaque has been erected at a house where he lived from 1915 to 1935, on Village Road, Oxton, Merseyside. In July 2023, a blue plaque was erected at a house in Aston Upthorpe, where he lived from 1945 to 1957.

He was the architect of the North East Wales Institute of Higher Education (NEWI) in Wrexham.

==Family==
Abercrombie married Emily Maud Gordon in 1908; they had one son and one daughter. He was widowed in 1942. Abercrombie was the brother of the poet and critic Lascelles Abercrombie, and uncle to Michael Abercrombie.

<text>Ping the Elastic Man (also named Here Comes Ping the Elastic Man) was a British comic strip that appeared in &quot;The Beano&quot; from 1938 to 1940. The comic was about a boy who could stretch his limbs as if they were made of elastic. It was created by Hugh McNeill.

==Background==
Hugh McNeill responded to R. D. Low&#x27;s newspaper ad hoping to be hired as a new artist for a developing comic. After samples of his work were sent to the Kayebon Press advertising agency, Low saw McNeill&#x27;s potential and hired him immediately. The story of Ping was developed and McNeill began designing for the series, which was published in the first issue of &quot;The Beano&quot;.

In the early stages of development, Ping was called Indy and the strip was called &quot;Indy the Rubber Man&quot;. McNeill&#x27;s work allowed him to create other comic strips, most notably &quot;Pansy Potter&quot;.

==Common strips==
Ping varied from being helpful to being too cocky for his own good. In the first issue, his boasting leads to people in the area playing with his limbs and dragging him out of shape. In another story, he uses his elastic arm to catch a vandal trying to break his elderly friend&#x27;s fence.

==Declining appearances==
McNeill would depart in the 1940s to join the Second World War. The comic was quietly discontinued after he left, although, like many &quot;Beano&quot; comic strips, &quot;Ping&quot; had Blitz-themed strips either encouraging the young readers to help the grown-ups, or mocking Nazis.

==Cameos==
After an absence of several decades, he met Minnie the Minx in issue 3185, a special 65th Anniversary issue. His head and neck also appeared in the inner cover of the 2019 Beano Annual with 254 other characters.

<text>Omomyidae is a group of early primates that radiated during the Eocene epoch between about (mya). Fossil omomyids are found in North America, Europe &amp; Asia, making it one of two groups of Eocene primates with a geographic distribution spanning holarctic continents, the other being the adapids (family Adapidae). Early representatives of the Omomyidae and Adapidae appear suddenly at the beginning of the Eocene (56 mya) in North America, Europe, and Asia, and are the earliest known crown primates.

==Characteristics==
Features that characterize many omomyids include large orbits (eye sockets), shortened rostra and dental arcades, loss of anterior premolars, cheek teeth adapted for insectivorous or frugivorous diets, and relatively small body mass (i.e., less than 500 g). However, by the late middle Eocene (about 40 mya), some North American omomyids evolved body masses in excess of and frugivorous or folivorous diets. The largest omomyids were &quot;Macrotarsius&quot; and &quot;Ourayia&quot;, both at in weight. Large orbits in genera such as &quot;Tetonius&quot;, &quot;Shoshonius&quot;, &quot;Necrolemur&quot;, and &quot;Microchoerus&quot; indicate that these taxa were probably nocturnal. At least one omomyid genus from the late Eocene of Texas (&quot;Rooneyia&quot;) had small orbits and was probably diurnal.

Like primates alive today, omomyids had grasping hands and feet with digits tipped by nails instead of claws, although they possessed toilet claws like modern lemurs. Features of their skeletons strongly indicate that omomyids lived in trees. In at least one genus (&quot;Necrolemur&quot;), the lower leg bones, the tibia and fibula, were fused as in modern tarsiers. This feature may indicate that &quot;Necrolemur&quot; leaped frequently. Most other omomyid genera (e.g., &quot;Omomys&quot;) lack specializations for leaping, and their skeletons are more like those of living dwarf and mouse lemurs.

Omomyid systematics and evolutionary relationships are controversial. Authors have suggested that omomyids are either: 
#stem haplorhines [i.e., basal members of the group including living tarsiers and anthropoids].
#stem tarsiiformes [i.e., basal offshoots of the tarsier lineage].
#stem primates more closely related to adapids than to living primate taxa.

Recent research suggests the Omomyiformes are stem haplorhines, making them likely a paraphyletic grouping.

Attempts to link omomyids to living groups have been complicated by their primitive (plesiomorphic) skeletal anatomy. For example, omomyids lack the numerous skeletal specializations of living haplorhines. These haplorhine adaptations - absent in omomyids - include:
# significant reduction of the canal for the stapedial branch of the internal carotid artery.
# route of the canal to house the promontory branch of the internal carotid artery through the auditory bulla of the temporal bone, i.e. &quot;perbullar&quot; (rather than across the promontory of tympanic cavity, &quot;transpromontorial&quot;) .
# contact between the alisphenoid and zygomatic bones.
# presence of an anterior accessory cavity confluent with the tympanic cavity.

Omomyids further demonstrate a gap between the upper central incisors, which presumably indicates the presence of a rhinarium and philtrum to channel fluids into the vomeronasal organ. Omomyids as a group also lack most of the derived specializations of living tarsiers, such as extremely enlarged orbits (&quot;Shoshonius&quot; is a possible exception), a large supra-meatal foramen for an anastomosis between the posterior auricular and middle meningeal circulation (again, &quot;Shoshonius&quot; is a possible exception, but the contents of the foramen in this extinct taxon are unknown), and extreme postcranial adaptations for leaping.

Among primates, omomyids have a uniquely derived characteristic. This is the presence of an aphaneric (not visible or readily distinguishable, due to its position), or &quot;intrabullar&quot; (within the bullae), ectotympanic bone, connected to the lateral wall of the auditory bulla by an unbroken annular bridge.

<doc id="480597" wikidata="Q2333821" url="?curid=480597" title="Frond">
<text>A frond is a large, divided leaf. In both common usage and botanical nomenclature, the leaves of ferns are referred to as fronds and some botanists restrict the term to this group. Other botanists allow the term frond to also apply to the large leaves of cycads, as well as palms (Arecaceae) and various other flowering plants, such as mimosa or sumac. &quot;Frond&quot; is commonly used to identify a large, compound leaf, but if the term is used botanically to refer to the leaves of ferns and algae it may be applied to smaller and undivided leaves.

Fronds have particular terms describing their components. Like all leaves, fronds usually have a stalk connecting them to the main stem. In botany, this leaf stalk is generally called a petiole, but in regard to fronds specifically it is called a stipe, and it supports a flattened blade (which may be called a lamina), and the continuation of the stipe into this portion is called the rachis. The blades may be simple (undivided), pinnatifid (deeply incised, but not truly compound), pinnate (compound with the leaflets arranged along a rachis to resemble a feather), or further compound (subdivided). If compound, a frond may be compound once, twice, or more.

==Pinnate fronds==

In a frond which is pinnate (feather-shaped), each leafy segment of the blade is called a pinna (plural pinnae), the stalk bearing the pinna is termed a petiolule, and the main vein or mid-rib of the pinna is referred to as a costa (plural costae). 

If a frond is divided once into pinnae, the frond is called once pinnate. In some fronds the pinnae are further divided into segments, creating a bipinnate frond. The segments into which each pinna are divided are called pinnules, and the extensions of the rachis that support these pinnules, are called rachillae. Rarely, a frond may even be tripinnate, in which case the pinnule divisions are known as ultimate segments. 

Pinnae may be arranged along the rachis either directly opposite one another or alternating up the stem. The arrangement may change from the base of a blade to the tip, as in the example of &quot;Blechnum&quot; shown below (from base to tip: pinnae opposite to alternate, and pinnatisect to pinnatifid).

== Non-pinnate fronds==
Some fronds are not pinnately compound (or simple), but may be palmate, costapalmate, or . 

There is a spectrum from costapalmate to palmate. Costapalmate fronds are shaped like the palm of a hand and have a short midrib or costa. Palmate fronds are also shaped like the palm of the hand, but all ribs or leaflets arise from a central area. A hastula is a flap of tissue borne at the insertion of the blade on the petiole on the upper, lower, or both leaf surfaces

Bifurcate fronds may also develop. The extinct Devonian seed plant &quot;Cosmosperma polyloba&quot; demonstrated the early evolutionary diversification of frond branching patterns, presenting both bifurcate and trifurcate types.

Some ferns, like members of the group Ophioglossales have a unique arrangement -- such as a single fleshy or amorphous leaf.

==Sporangia==
Fern fronds often bear sporangia, where the plant&#x27;s spores are formed, usually on the underside (abaxial surface) of the pinnae, but sometimes marginally or scattered over the frond. The sporangia are typically clustered into a sorus (pl., sori). Associated with each sorus in many species is a membranous protective structure called an indusium, which is an outgrowth of the blade surface that may partly cover the sporangia. Some fern species feature frond dimorphism, in which fertile and sterile fronds differ in appearance and structure. 

==Fern fronds==
Fern fronds, as with all leaves, arise from the stem, either directly, or on an outgrowth from the stem termed a phyllopodium. The stem of a typical (leptosporangiate) fern is subterranean or horizontal on the surface of the ground. These stems are called rhizomes. Many fern fronds are initially coiled into a fiddle-head or crozier (see circinate vernation), although cycad and palm fronds do not have this pattern of new leaf growth.

Fronds may bear hairs, scales, glands, and, in some species, bulblets for vegetative reproduction.

==Related concepts==
Fronds may describe several &quot;frondose&quot; structures in non-plant organisms -- such as the entire bodies of thalloid organisms, or the superficially leaf-like structures developed by some animals and fungi. Examples include frondose colonial bryozoans, extinct Ediacaran biota such as rangeomorphs, and some macroalgae and lichens. 

In paleontology of Ediacaran marine organisms, a frond may be defined as &quot;a rangeomorph unit with a growth tip that can generate primary branches&quot;. A frond may also refer to the entire frondose organism, including any stem or basal disc. To classify rangeomorph taxa, the frond is generally subdivided into segments as are those of a fern, and categorized by six factors: polarity, rows of branches, inflation, display/furling, alignment of branches, and presence of a basal disc.

Frondescence is the production of leaves; it can also refer to the abnormal development of floral parts into leafy structures, though this is usually called phyllody.

==Cultural significance==
The palm frond has been a symbol of victory, triumph, peace, and eternal life originating in the ancient Mediterranean world. For example, in some Christian traditions, during Palm Sunday, Jesus’ entrance into Jerusalem is celebrated by carrying palm leaves. 

During the Victorian phenomenon of Pteridomania or &quot;fern craze&quot;, fern fronds became wildly popular symbols. Because fronds are somewhat flat, they could be used for decoration in ways that many other plants could not be. They were glued into collectors&#x27; albums, affixed to three dimensional objects, used as stencils for &quot;spatter-work&quot;, inked and pressed into surfaces for nature printing, and so forth.

The fern flower is a magic flower in Polish folklore. As ferns are non-flowering plants, this technically refers to &quot;fertile fronds&quot;. Certain true ferns, e.g., &quot;Osmunda regalis&quot; have sporangia in tight clusters which may appear flower-like.

<text>Welshpool ( ) is a market town and community in Powys, Wales, historically in the county of Montgomeryshire. The town is from the Wales–England border and low-lying on the River Severn. The community, which also includes Cloddiau and Pool Quay, has a population of 6,664 (as of the 2011 United Kingdom census), with the town having 5,948. There are many examples of Georgian architecture within the town. Powis Castle is located to the north.

==Toponym==
&quot;Y Trallwng&quot; is the Welsh language name of the town. It means &quot;the marshy or sinking land&quot;. In English it was initially known as Pool but its name was changed to Welshpool in 1835 to distinguish it from the English town of Poole in Dorset. 

==History==

St Cynfelin is reputed to be the founder of two churches in the town, St Mary&#x27;s and St Cynfelin&#x27;s, during the Age of the Saints in the 5th and 6th centuries.

The parish of Welshpool roughly coincides with the medieval commote of Ystrad Marchell in the cantref of Ystlyg in the Kingdom of Powys.

The Long Mountain, which plays as a backdrop to most of Welshpool, once served as the ultimate grounds for defence for fortresses in the times when the town was just a swampy marsh.

Welshpool served briefly as the capital of Powys Wenwynwyn or South Powys after its prince was forced to flee the traditional Welsh royal site at Mathrafal in 1212, by the prince of Gwynedd; assistance from the English crown (enemies of the Gwynedd prince) restored the Wenwynwyn dynasty to their lands. Further disputes with Gwynedd again brought in the English; in 1284, the family strengthened their hold on Powys Wenwynwyn by converting it into a marcher lordship (via &quot;surrender and re-grant&quot;) - the Lordship of Powys. Owain, the heir to the former principality, called himself Owen de la Pole, after the town.

The town was devastated by the forces of Owain Glyndŵr (heir to Powys Fadog - North Powys) in 1400 at the start of his rebellion against the English king Henry IV. Today, the waymarked, 135-mile long-distance footpath and National Trail, Glyndŵr&#x27;s Way, ends in Pont Howell Park, alongside the Montgomery Canal.

In 1411 the priest at the church St Mary&#x27;s was Adam of Usk.

==Population==

The population of Welshpool has risen since 2001.

==Historic buildings==
St Mary&#x27;s Church is a Grade I listed building. The original church dated from about 1250, there are remains of this church in the lower courses of the church tower. The nave was rebuilt in the 16th century, and the whole building was substantially restored in 1871. The 15th century chancel ceiling may have come from Strata Marcella Abbey, about away, and a stone in the churchyard is said to have been part of the abbot&#x27;s throne. A memorial in the church commemorates Bishop William Morgan, translator of the Bible into Welsh, who was the vicar from 1575 to 1579.

The Mermaid Inn, 28 High Street, was very probably an early 16th-century merchant&#x27;s house, placed on a burgage plot between the High Street and Alfred Jones Court. The timber-framed building has long storehouse or wing to the rear. The frontage was remodelled 1890, by Frank H. Shayler, architect, of Shrewsbury. Early illustrations of the building show that prior to this it had a thatched roof and that the timbering was not exposed. There is a passage to side with heavy box-framing in square panels, with brick infill exposed in side elevation and in rear wing. The frontage was exposed by Shayler to show decorative timber work on the upper storey. An Inn by the 19th century when it was owned by a family named Sparrow.

There is an octagonal brick cockpit in New Street, which was built in the early 18th century and was in continual use for cockfighting until the practice was outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1849. , it is the home of the town&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Institute. Welshpool Town Hall, which was completed in 1874, is a Grade II listed building.

==Transport==
Welshpool railway station is on the Cambrian Line and is served by Transport for Wales. The town is also the starting point of the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway, a narrow-gauge heritage railway popular with tourists, with its terminus station at Raven Square. The light railway once ran through the town to the Cambrian Line railway station, but today Raven Square, located on the western edge of the town, is the eastern terminus of the line.

A small network of bus services link surrounding towns and villages, mainly operated by Tanat Valley Coaches. Notable is service No X75, serving Shrewsbury to the east and Newtown and Llanidloes to the south west, also service No D71 to Oswestry via Guilsfield and Llanymynech. In addition there is a local town service operated by Owen&#x27;s Coaches. The semi-disused Montgomery Canal also runs through Welshpool. To the south of the town is Welshpool Airport which is also known as the Mid Wales Airport. Three major trunk roads pass through Welshpool: the A458, A483 and the A490.

==Economy==
The local economy is primarily based upon agriculture and local industry. The Smithfield Livestock Market is the largest one-day sheep market in Europe. Market days are on Mondays.

The town&#x27;s industrial estates are home to numerous different types of small industry, ranging from metal to food production. Due to the town&#x27;s small size and population the attraction of high street stores and stores that cut keys is limited, meaning that many of the residents prefer to shop in neighbouring towns like Shrewsbury. However Welshpool remains an important hub serving its agricultural hinterland. The town is home to the headquarters of the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust and the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust.

==Education==
The town is the home of Ardwyn Nursery and Infants School, Oldford Nursery and Infants School, Gungrog Nursery and Infants School, Maes-y-dre Primary School. Welshpool High School is a secondary school which teaches a range of pupils from ages 11–18 and has a good standard of education throughout Key Stage 3 and 4 and GCSE studies.

==Sport==
Welshpool has a football club (Welshpool Town F.C.) and a rugby union club (Welshpool Rugby Football Club). The football club was jointly managed for a period in the late 2010s by Chris Roberts and Neil Pryce but with little success. The town also has hockey and cricket clubs. The Montgomeryshire Marauders Rugby League Club are also nominally based in Welshpool, as this is where the majority of their home fixtures take place.

<text>Cheviot () is a town in the Hurunui District of north Canterbury, on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It is located on State Highway 1, approximately north of Christchurch and south of Kaikōura.

==History and naming==
The government under Minister of Lands John McKenzie bought the Cheviot Hills estate between 1892 and 1893 from the descendants of William Robinson. The Cheviot Hills estate was broken into 54 farms and a township, which was originally called McKenzie. This name was &quot;in widespread use for a decade or two&quot; but gradually fell into disuse. The Cheviot county council was formed 1895. In 1901 the township had a population of 113.

A large earthquake measuring 6.9 hit near Cheviot on 16 November 1901. A number of buildings were badly damaged and one death was reported.

The post office was always known as Cheviot and by at least 1913 the township too was generally known as Cheviot. Cheviot Hills estate had been named by its original lease holder, John Scott Caverhill, after his home country, the Cheviot Hills straddling the Anglo-Scottish border. 

The Robinson homestead burned down in 1936. Its foundations and grounds became part of the Cheviot Hills Domain, with the homestead&#x27;s original front steps part of the cricket pavilion.

The Cheviot County rural water supply was opened in 1971. It cost $420,000 and supplies water to an area of 128,000 acres through 190 miles of pipes. A fountain, which sits outside the local school, was built to commemorate the event.

==Demographics==
Cheviot is defined by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement and covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. Cheviot is part of the larger Parnassus statistical area.

Cheviot had a population of 372 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 6 people (1.6%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 18 people (−4.6%) since the 2006 census. There were 177 households, comprising 183 males and 186 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.98 males per female, with 60 people (16.1%) aged under 15 years, 39 (10.5%) aged 15 to 29, 144 (38.7%) aged 30 to 64, and 129 (34.7%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 87.1% European/Pākehā, 21.8% Māori, 4.0% Pasifika, 2.4% Asian, and 0.8% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 45.2% had no religion, 40.3% were Christian, 1.6% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.8% were Muslim and 0.8% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 18 (5.8%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 93 (29.8%) people had no formal qualifications. 21 people (6.7%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 108 (34.6%) people were employed full-time, 63 (20.2%) were part-time, and 9 (2.9%) were unemployed.

==The region==
Cheviot is a service town for highway traffic and for a pastoral farming district that is currently predominant in sheep farming. Based in the township are a volunteer fire and ambulance services and one full-time police officer. Surrounding settlements include:

===Domett===
Originally a railway town, Domett is now only populated by farms and a petrol station. Next to the Old Main Road/Hurunui Mouth Road junction is the old Domett Railway Station, relocated and refurbished as a cafe. Domett Service Station provides after-hours sale of fuel (with surcharge): most service stations in the area close around 6pm.

===Spotswood===
Spotswood has an old hall that is still used regularly, and mainly consists of farms around Waiau East Road.

===Parnassus===
Parnassus has a higher population than the other settlements, although the local Parnassus School was closed in 2008. The famous Waiau River road/rail bridge was here, before being abandoned and replaced with a new road bridge. Prior to the opening of the old bridge in the 1930s a ferry across the river carried goods north and south. The Waiau River ends not far away; however, access to the river mouth must be made over farm property with the owners&#x27; permission. On the State Highway north of Parnassus is Leader Road which leads to the townships of Waiau, Rotherham, Culverden and Hanmer Springs.

===Gore Bay===
Gore Bay is a surfing beach with summer beach houses and 14 permanent residents. There are two local camping grounds, each with beach access and business. It is a popular New Year&#x27;s Eve venue.

Of note is Cathedral Gully, a spectacular weathered clay canyon.

===Port Robinson===

Once a prospering port, Port Robinson is now an abandoned wreck. The old wharf may still be seen, but it is in a dangerous state of disrepair.

===Stonyhurst Station===
Stonyhurst is a farming station in the Blythe Valley, southwest of Cheviot.

It was founded in 1851 by Frederick Weld and Charles Clifford. He had gained his impression when walking from Lyttelton to Flaxbourne, in Marlborough. Clifford landed sheep on the beach just south of the Blythe River which was later known as Stonyhurst Station, named after Stonyhurst College in England where they were both educated.

The farm originally occupied nearly , the whole of the Blythe Valley. About was sold in 1863, and a further a decade later. In about 1900, much of the rest of the land was subdivided. The current station is about one tenth of the original area.

The area is described by the local authority as &quot;a potentially significant natural area&quot;, and the manager&#x27;s cottage is a Category II protected building under the Historic Places Act.

==Education==
Schooling in Cheviot commenced in 1894. The first school was the McKenzie School, where the A&amp;P Showgrounds are today. The name changed to Cheviot School in 1931. From its inception, the school provided primary education up to Form Two. In 1937, it became the Cheviot District High School.

Cheviot Area School is a composite, co-educational school for Year 1 to 13 students. It also has a wider role providing continuing education, facilities and support for community groups. The closest main contributing school, Parnassus, a year 1-6 school, closed in 2008. It had a roll of as of .

The large oak trees in the school grounds were planted to commemorate those former students who died in World War 2.

Cheviot Area School competes in the Canterbury Area Schools Association Festival sporting competition with schools in Akaroa, Amuri, Hawarden, Oxford, and Rangiora. It also takes part in international exchanges with schools in Japan and Canada.

The township has two preschools, Cheviot Learning Centre and The Tree Hut.

==Climate==
The mean yearly highest temperature for Cheviot from 2008–2024 was .

<doc id="480614" wikidata="Q7894688" url="?curid=480614" title="University Farm (Nottinghamshire)">
<text>University Farm is a 445 hectare (4.45 km2) commercial research farm attached to the Sutton Bonington Campus of the University of Nottingham, England. It lies across the parishes of Sutton Bonington and Kingston on Soar. There are two further blocks of land in Clifton on the north bank of the River Trent and at Bunny Park in the village of Bunny. Both these block are several miles from the main campus.

==Facilities==
The farm is managed as a high performance commercial arable/dairy unit. It provides first class resources in the form of; technologically advanced facilities (including individual cow feeders, robot milking parlours), diverse soil types and cropping, and high health livestock: all of which create significant opportunities for research. It also has a key educational role by providing an environment for the effective tuition of students in biosciences and veterinary science. This is enhanced by the unique proximity of the farm to the campus as it surrounds the Biosciences and Vet School on all sides.

===Livestock===
The dairy herd consists of 200 cows, which are milked using 4 Lely robot milking units. Heifers are reared on the farm. Current herd average is 10,700 litres placing it in the top 10% of dairy herds in the UK. Land used by the University Vet School and Bio-Resource unit is also managed by the farm. The dairy herd is managed by Nige Armstrong.

===Arable land===
325 hectares are devoted to arable crops including cereals and oilseed rape; a further 5 hectares is currently in an organic rotation. 80 hectares of land is used to grow grass and maize silage for the dairy unit. The arable area will be utilising a direct drill establishment method for cereal and grass crops from Autumn 2012. The remaining land support 20 hectares of mature woodland and 15 hectares in environmental schemes. Approx 18 hectares of the arable rotation is devoted to a range of crop trials. There are a range of soil types across the farm ranging from &quot;blow-away&quot; sands to Keuper Marl clays.

===Jubilee Woodland===
As of November 2012 approx 24ha (60 acres) of the farm at Sutton Bonington will be used to plant a Jubilee woodland. The woodland will be linked by a path along the River Soar allowing it to form a stunning educational and amenity area for the university and surrounding communities.

<doc id="480615" wikidata="Q2630469" url="?curid=480615" title="New York and New Jersey campaign">
<text>The New York and New Jersey campaign in 1776 and the winter months of 1777 was a series of American Revolutionary War battles for control of the Port of New York and the state of New Jersey, fought between British forces under General Sir William Howe and the Continental Army under General George Washington. Howe was successful in driving Washington out of New York, but overextended his reach into New Jersey, and ended the New York and New Jersey campaign in January 1777 with only a few outposts near New York City under British control. The British held New York Harbor for the rest of the Revolutionary War, using it as a base for expeditions against other targets.

Landing unopposed on Staten Island on July 3, 1776, Howe had assembled an army that included components that had withdrawn from Boston in March following the British failure to hold that city, combined with additional British troops, and Hessian troops hired from several German principalities. Washington&#x27;s Continental Army included New England soldiers and regiments from the Thirteen Colonies as far south as the Colony of Virginia. Landing on Long Island in August, Howe defeated Washington in the largest battle of the war in North America, but the Continental Army was able to regroup and make an orderly and covert retreat to Manhattan that night under a cover of darkness and fog. Washington suffered a series of further defeats in Manhattan but prevailed in a skirmish at the Battle of Harlem Heights and eventually withdrew his troops successfully to White Plains, New York. Howe, meanwhile, returned to Manhattan and captured those forces Washington had left on the island.

Washington and much of his army crossed the Hudson River to Rockland County and then south into New Jersey, retreated across the state, and then crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. Along the way, his army shrunk due to the ending of enlistment periods, desertions, and poor morale. Howe ordered his troops into winter quarters in December, establishing a chain of outposts from New York City to Burlington, New Jersey. Washington, in a tremendous boost to American morale, launched a successful strike against the Trenton garrison on the morning of December 26, 1776, prompting Howe to withdraw his chain of outposts back to New Brunswick and the coast near New York. Washington, in turn, established his winter camp at Morristown. During the following winter months and through the rest of the war, both sides skirmished frequently around New York City and New Jersey as the British sought forage and provisions.

Britain maintained control of New York City and some of the surrounding territory until the war ended in 1783, using it as a base for operations elsewhere in North America. In 1777, General Howe launched a campaign to capture the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia, leaving General Sir Henry Clinton in command of the New York area, while General John Burgoyne led an attempt to gain control of the Hudson River valley, moving south from Quebec and being defeated at Saratoga.

==Background==
When the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775, British troops were under siege in Boston. They defeated Patriot forces in the Battle of Bunker Hill, suffering very high casualties. When news of this expensive British victory reached London, General William Howe and Lord George Germain, the British official responsible, determined that a &quot;decisive action&quot; should be taken against New York City using forces recruited from throughout the British Empire as well as troops hired from small German states.

Washington, who was named commander-in-chief of the Continental Army by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, echoed the sentiments of other in the Congress that New York was &quot;a post of infinite importance&quot;, and began the task of organizing military companies in the New York area when he stopped there on his way from Philadelphia to take command of the siege of Boston. In January 1776, Washington ordered Charles Lee to raise troops and take command of New York&#x27;s defenses. Lee made some progress on the city&#x27;s defenses when word arrived in late March that the British army had left Boston after Washington threatened them from heights south of the city. Concerned that General Howe was sailing directly to New York, Washington hurried regiments from Boston, including General Israel Putnam, who commanded the troops until Washington himself arrived in mid-April. At the end of April, Washington dispatched General John Sullivan with six regiments to the north to bolster the faltering Quebec campaign.

General Howe, rather than moving against New York, withdrew his army to Halifax in Nova Scotia, and regrouped while transports full of British troops, shipped from bases around Europe and intended for New York, began gathering at Halifax. In June, Howe set sail for New York with the 9,000 men assembled there, before all of the transports arrived. German troops, primarily from Hesse-Kassel, and British troops from Henry Clinton&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful expedition to the Carolinas, were supposed to meet with Howe&#x27;s fleet when it reached New York. General Howe&#x27;s brother, Admiral Lord Howe, arrived at Halifax with further transports after the general sailed, and immediately followed.

When General Howe arrived in the outer harbor of New York, the ships began sailing up the undefended Narrows between Staten Island and Long Island on July 2, and started landing troops on the undefended shores of Staten Island. Washington learned from prisoners taken that Howe had landed 10,000 men, but was awaiting the arrival of another 15,000. General Washington, with a smaller army of about 19,000 effective troops, lacked significant military intelligence on the British force and plans, and was uncertain exactly where in the New York area the Howes intended to strike. He consequently split the Continental Army between fortified positions on Long Island, Manhattan, and mainland locations, and also established a Flying Camp in northern New Jersey that was intended as a reserve force that could support operations anywhere along the New Jersey side of the Hudson River.

==Capture of New York City==

The Howe brothers had been granted authority as peace commissioners by the British Parliament with limited powers to pursue a peaceful resolution to the conflict. King George III was not optimistic about the possibility for peace, however, saying, &quot;yet I think it right to be attempted, whilst every act of vigour is unremittingly carried on&quot;. Their powers were limited to granting of &quot;general and special pardons&quot; and to &quot;confer with any of his Majesty&#x27;s subjects&quot;. On July 14, pursuant to these powers, Admiral Howe sent a messenger with a letter addressed to &quot;George Washington, Esq.&quot; across the harbor. Washington&#x27;s adjutant, Joseph Reed, politely informed the messenger that no person with that title was in their army. Admiral Howe&#x27;s aide wrote that &quot;the Punctilio of an Address&quot; should not have prevented the letter&#x27;s delivery, and Howe was said to be visibly annoyed by the rejection. A second request, addressed to &quot;George Washington, Esq., etc.&quot; was similarly rejected, although the messenger was told that Washington would receive one of Howe&#x27;s adjutants. In that fruitless meeting, held July 20, Washington pointed out that the limited powers the Howe brothers had been given were not of much use, as the rebels had done no wrong requiring an amnesty.

In late August, the British transported about 22,000 men, including 9,000 Hessians, from Staten Island to Long Island. In the Battle of Long Island on August 27, the British outflanked the American positions, driving the Americans back to their Brooklyn Heights fortifications. General Howe then began to lay siege to the works, but Washington skillfully managed a nighttime retreat through his unguarded rear across the East River to the island of Manhattan. Howe then paused to consolidate his position and consider his next move.

During the Battle of Long Island, the British captured General John Sullivan. Admiral Howe convinced him to deliver a message to Congress in Philadelphia, and released him on parole. Washington also gave his permission, and on September 2 Sullivan told the Congress that the Howes wanted to negotiate, and had been given much broader powers to treat than those they actually held. This created a diplomatic problem for Congress, which did not want to be seen as aggressive, which is how some representatives felt a direct rejection of the appeal would appear. Consequently, Congress agreed to send a committee to meet with the Howes in a move they did not think would bear any fruit. On September 11, the Howe brothers met with John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Edward Rutledge in the Staten Island Peace Conference. The positions expressed by the two groups in the three-hour meeting were irreconcilable.

Washington, who had previously been ordered by the Continental Congress to hold New York City, was concerned that he might have escaped one trap for another, since the army was still vulnerable to being surrounded on Manhattan. To keep his escape routes open to the north, he placed 5,000 troops in the city (which then only occupied the lower portion of Manhattan), and took the rest of the army to Harlem Heights. In the first recorded use of a submarine in warfare, he also attempted a novel attack on the Royal Navy, launching &quot;Turtle&quot; in a failed attempt to sink , Admiral Howe&#x27;s flagship.

On September 15, General Howe landed about 12,000 men on Lower Manhattan, quickly taking control of New York City. The Americans withdrew to Harlem, where they skirmished the next day, but held their ground. Rather than attempting to dislodge Washington from his strong position a second time, Howe again opted for a flanking maneuver. Landing troops with some opposition in October in Westchester County across the Harlem River and north of Manhattan, he sought once again to encircle Washington. To defend against this move, Washington withdrew most of his army to White Plains, where after a short battle on October 28 he retreated further north. The retreat of Washington&#x27;s forces was aided by a dense fog which concealed their movement to the British troops. This isolated the remaining Continental Army troops in upper Manhattan, so Howe returned to Manhattan and captured Fort Washington in mid-November, taking almost 3,000 prisoners.

Four days later, November 20, Fort Lee, across the Hudson River from Fort Washington, was also taken. Washington brought much of his army across the Hudson into New Jersey, but was immediately forced to retreat by the aggressive British advance.

General Howe, after consolidating British positions around New York harbor, detached 6,000 men under the command of two of his more difficult subordinates, Henry Clinton, and Hugh, Earl Percy to take Newport, Rhode Island and its strategic port east across Long Island Sound (which they did without opposition on December 8), while he sent General Lord Cornwallis to chase Washington&#x27;s army through New Jersey. The Americans withdrew across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania in early December.

==Reactions==

The outlook of the Continental Army—and thus the revolution itself—was bleak. &quot;These are the times that try men&#x27;s souls&quot;, wrote Thomas Paine in &quot;The American Crisis&quot;. Washington&#x27;s army had dwindled to fewer than 5,000 men fit for duty and would be significantly reduced further after enlistments expired at the end of the year. Spirits were low, popular support was wavering, and Congress had abandoned Philadelphia, fearing a British attack. Washington ordered some of the troops that returned from the failed invasion of Quebec to join him, and also ordered General Lee&#x27;s troops, which he had left north of New York City, to join him. Lee, whose relationship with Washington was at times difficult, made excuses and only traveled as far as Morristown, New Jersey. When Lee strayed too far from his army on December 12, his exposed position was betrayed by Loyalists, and a British company led by Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton surrounded the inn where he was staying and took him prisoner. Lee&#x27;s command was taken over by John Sullivan, who finished marching the army to Washington&#x27;s camp across the river from Trenton.

The capture of Lee presented the Howes with a problematic prisoner. As with a number of other Continental Army leaders, he had previously served in the British Army. Because of this the Howes at first treated him as a deserter, with threats of military punishment. However, Washington intervened, tying the treatment of Lee to the treatment of prisoners held by the Americans. Lee was ultimately treated well, and apparently offered the British commanders advice on how to win the war. Because the Americans did not have a prisoner of comparable rank, Lee remained a prisoner in New York until 1778, when he was exchanged for Richard Prescott.

The failure of the Continental Army to hold New York also brought about a rise in Loyalist activity, as the city became a haven for refugee supporters of the Crown from elsewhere across the region. The British therefore actively recruited in New York and New Jersey to build regiments of provincial militia, with some success. Loyalists in these areas may have been motivated by seeing elements of the rebel army head home after their enlistments ended. One New York Patriot militia leader wrote that thirty of his men, rather than reenlisting with him, had instead signed up with the enemy. On November 30 Admiral Howe offered amnesty to anyone that had taken up arms against the Crown, provided they swore an oath to it. Washington responded with his own proclamation suggesting that those who did not renounce such oaths should immediately go behind British lines. As a result, New Jersey became a civil battlefield, with militia activity as well as spying and counterspying continuing for the rest of the war.

News of the capture of New York was favorably received in London, and General Howe was awarded the Order of the Bath for his work. Combined with news of the recovery of Quebec, circumstances suggested to British leaders that the war could be ended with one more year&#x27;s campaigning. News of Admiral Howe&#x27;s amnesty proclamation was met with some surprise, as its terms were more lenient than the hardliners in the government expected. Politicians opposed to the war pointed out that the proclamation failed to mention the primacy of the Parliament. Furthermore, the Howes were criticized for failing to keep Parliament informed of the various peace efforts they embarked on.

==Howe&#x27;s strategy==
With the campaign at an apparent conclusion for the season, the British established a chain of outposts in New Jersey stretching from Perth Amboy to Bordentown, and entered winter quarters. They controlled New York harbor and much of New Jersey, and were in a good position to resume operations in the spring, with the rebel capital of Philadelphia in striking distance. Howe detached General Clinton with 6,000 additional men to occupy Newport as a base for future operations against Boston and Connecticut. Howe then sketched a campaign for the following year in a letter to Lord Germain: 10,000 men at Newport, 10,000 for an expedition to Albany (to meet an army descending from Quebec), 8,000 to cross New Jersey and threaten Philadelphia, and 5,000 to defend New York. If additional foreign forces were available, operations could also be considered against the southern states.

==Counterattack in New Jersey==
While worrying over how to hold his army together, Washington organized attacks on the relatively exposed British outposts, which were as a result continually on edge due to ongoing militia and army raids. German commanders Carl von Donop and Johann Rall, whose brigades were at the end of the chain of outposts, were frequent targets of these raids, but their repeated warnings and requests for support from General James Grant were dismissed.

Beginning in mid-December 1776, Washington planned a two-pronged attack on Rall&#x27;s outpost in Trenton, with a third diversionary attack on Donop&#x27;s outpost in Bordentown. The plan was aided by the fortuitous presence of a militia company that drew Donop&#x27;s entire 2,000-man force away from Bordentown to the south that resulted in a skirmish at Mount Holly on December 23. The consequence of this action was that Donop was not in a position to assist Rall when Washington&#x27;s attack on Trenton took place. Washington and 2,400 men stealthily crossed the Delaware River and surprised Rall&#x27;s outpost on the morning of December 26 in a street-to-street battle, killing or capturing nearly 1,000 Hessians. This action not only significantly boosted the army&#x27;s morale; it also brought Cornwallis out of New York. He reassembled an army of more than 6,000 men and marched most of them against a position Washington had taken south of Trenton. Leaving a garrison of 1,200 at Princeton, Cornwallis then attacked Washington&#x27;s position on January 2, 1777, and was three times repulsed before darkness set in. During the night Washington once again stealthily moved his army, going around that of Cornwallis with the intention of attacking the Princeton garrison.
On January 3, Hugh Mercer, leading the American advance guard, encountered British soldiers from Princeton under the command of Charles Mawhood. The British troops engaged Mercer and in the ensuing battle, Mercer was mortally wounded. Washington sent reinforcements under General John Cadwalader, which were successful in driving Mawhood and the British from Princeton, with many of them fleeing to Cornwallis in Trenton. The British lost more than one quarter of their force in the battle, and American morale further rose with the victory. This period, from December 25, 1776, through January 3, 1777, has become known as the Ten Crucial Days.

The defeats convinced General Howe to withdraw most of his army from New Jersey, only leaving outposts at New Brunswick and Perth Amboy. Washington entered winter quarters at Morristown, having retaken most of the state from the British. However, provisions for both armies were limited, and commanders on both sides sent out parties to forage for food and other supplies. For the next few months, they engaged in a forage war, in which each targeted the foraging parties of the other. This led to numerous skirmishes and minor confrontations including the Battle of Millstone. The British also sniped with each other over the subject of provisions. Lord Percy resigned his command after a series of disagreements with Howe came to a head over the ability of the Newport station to provide forage to the New York and New Jersey forces.

==Aftermath==

The British gained control of New York Harbor and the surrounding agricultural areas, and held New York City and Long Island until the war ended in 1783. The Americans suffered significant casualties and lost important supplies, but Washington managed to retain the core of his army and avoid a decisive confrontation that could have ended the war. With the bold strokes of Trenton and Princeton, he had regained initiative and boosted morale. The areas around New York City in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut were an ongoing battleground for the rest of the war.

The early reports that General Howe sent to his superiors in London concerning the battles at Trenton and Princeton attempted to minimize their significance, blaming Rall for Trenton, and trying to recast Princeton as a nearly successful defense. Not everyone was fooled by his accounts, particularly not Lord Germain. In a letter to the Hessian General Leopold Philip von Heister Germain wrote that &quot;the officer who commanded [the forces at Trenton] and to whom this misfortune is to be attributed has lost his life by his rashness.&quot; Heister in turn had to report the loss to his ruler, Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, with the news that not only had an entire brigade been lost, but sixteen regimental colors and six cannon as well. The news reportedly enraged Frederick, who broadly suggested that Heister return home (which he did, turning over command of the Hessian forces to Wilhelm von Knyphausen). Frederick also ordered extensive inquiries into the events of 1776, that took place in New York from 1778 to 1782. These inquiries created a unique archive of materials about the campaign.

The news of Washington&#x27;s successes reached Paris at a critical time. Britain&#x27;s ambassador to France, Lord Stormont, was preparing complaints to France&#x27;s foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes, concerning the semi-secret financial and logistical support France had been giving to the revolutionaries. Stormont had learned that supplies bound for America were to be shipped under French flags, where they had previously sent under American colors. He wrote that the French court was extremely happy with the news, and that the French diplomatic position noticeably hardened: &quot;that M. de Vergennes is hostile in his heart and anxious for the success of the Rebels I have not a shadow of a doubt.&quot;

==Next steps==

The British planned two major operations for the 1777 campaign season. The first was an ambitious plan to gain control of the Hudson River valley, whose central thrust was a move along Lake Champlain by the army from Quebec under General John Burgoyne. Execution of this plan ultimately failed, ending with the surrender of Burgoyne&#x27;s army at Saratoga, New York, in October. The second operation was General Howe&#x27;s plan to take Philadelphia, which, after a difficult start, met with success in September.

Washington&#x27;s strategy in 1777 continued to be a basically defensive one. He successfully fended off an attempt by Howe to draw him into a general engagement in northern New Jersey, but was unable to prevent Howe&#x27;s later success taking Philadelphia. He did send material help to General Horatio Gates, who was tasked with defending against Burgoyne&#x27;s movements. Major General Benedict Arnold and Daniel Morgan&#x27;s riflemen all played a notable role in the defeat of Burgoyne, following which France entered the war.

==Legacy==
In the urban environments of Manhattan, Brooklyn, The Bronx, Westchester and Trenton there are plaques and other memorials placed to commemorate the actions that took place in and around those locations. The Princeton Battlefield and Washington&#x27;s Crossing are National Historic Landmarks, with state parks also preserving all or part of the locations where events of this campaign occurred in those areas. Morristown National Historical Park preserves locations occupied by the Continental Army during the winter months at the end of the campaign.

<doc id="480618" wikidata="Q6041039" url="?curid=480618" title="Institutes of technology in the Republic of Ireland">
<text>An Institute of Technology (IT) is a type of higher education college found in Ireland. In 2018, there were a total of fourteen colleges that use the title of Institute of Technology, which were created from the late 1960s and were formerly known as Regional Technical Colleges. The exception to this was Dublin Institute of Technology which emerged independently of the Regional College system. The Technological Universities Act of 2018 allowed the merger of two or more IoTs into Technological Universities, which saw the creation of the Technological University Dublin in 2019; Munster Technological University and Technological University Shannon: Midlands Midwest in 2021; and Atlantic Technological University and South East Technological University in 2022.

== Creation ==
The idea of the institutions was first announced by Patrick Hillery in 1963. A year later, a site for an institution in Carlow was identified.

The &quot;Investment in Education&quot; (1962) and &quot;Training of Technicians in Ireland&quot; (1964) reports greatly accelerated the trend in Ireland for education reform and development particularly in technical education, similar to that in other Western countries at the time.

The &quot;Training of Technicians in Ireland&quot; (1964) report identified significant skills gaps, including:

:&quot;a further serious difficulty in the task of raising the standards of technicians in Ireland is the lack of a nationally recognised technician diploma. The absence of such a diploma deters many parents from considering sub-professional technician careers for their children&quot;

The &quot;Steering Committee on Technical Education&quot;, also called &quot;The Mulcahy Report&quot; (1967), was an important milestone in framing the institutional structures and functions calling for:

:&quot;we believe that the long-term function of the colleges will be to educate for trade and industry over a broad spectrum of occupations ranging from craft to professional, notably in engineering and science but also in commercial, linguistic and other specialities. They will, however, be more immediately concerned with providing courses aimed at filling gaps in the industrial manpower structure, particularly in the technician area&quot;

:&quot;we do not foresee any final fixed pattern of courses in the colleges. If they are to make their most effective contribution to the needs of society and the economy, they must be capable of continuing adaptation to social, economic and technological changes. Initiative at local and national levels will largely determine how far this vital characteristic is developed. We are concerned that the progress of these colleges should not be deterred by any artificial limitation of either the scope or the level of their educational achievements&quot;

The building programme commenced in 1968, with the first institutions formally opened their doors in 1970, and other colleges were added during the following decade. Some colleges developed from earlier institutions and colleges, involving amalgamation, but most were completely new institutions. A Regional Technical College for Limerick was cancelled after a &quot;National Institute for Higher Education&quot; was announced for the city. Finally, in 1993, CoACT (College of Art, Commerce and Technology) became Limerick RTC. Two additional institutions were created since then, bringing the total to thirteen, before the amalgamation of three into Ireland&#x27;s first Technological University, TU Dublin. As of June 2023, only Dundalk IT and Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology remain independent Institutes of Technology.



== Legislation ==

The institutions were run under Section 21 (2) of the &quot;Vocational Education Acts&quot; from 1970 until 1992 as special subcommittees of the Vocational Education Committees, and placed on an independent basis thereafter by the &quot;Regional Technical Colleges Acts&quot; in 1993. In the late 1990s, all of the institutions were upgraded to &quot;Institute of Technology&quot; status. This was in recognition of the high standards, including university level research, which takes place at them. The institutes are governed by the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006. Having been given &quot;delegated authority&quot; to confer their own awards in some cases up to Doctoral level by HETAC from 2001 onwards, in 2019 the institutes were designated as awarding bodies up to masters level in their own right.

== Management ==

The individual institutions are structured similar to other universities, particularly Irish ones. Each institution has a Director, who is the chief operational officer of the institution, usually assisted by an &quot;ad-hoc&quot; senior management team; a Registrar, who is the chief academic officer of the institution; a Governing Council, which oversees operational affairs; an Academic Council, which oversees academic affairs. Each academic school has a Head of School and each academic department of a school has a Head of Department.

== Programmes ==

The institutions traditional courses were National Certificate and National Diploma type courses particularly in business, engineering and science, this was very much the founding principle. During the late 1970s degrees at Bachelor&#x27;s level were introduced, later Master&#x27;s and Doctoral levels were also allowed. In recent years there has been a rapid expansion in apprenticeship and nursing type courses.

== Validation ==
Traditionally awards were conferred by the &quot;National Council for Educational Awards&quot;, this statutory authority became the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, and other awards are conferred by the Further Education and Training Awards Council. Some specialised courses, such as accountancy, are validated by professional bodies but these are nearly always the exception.

==Technological Universities==

Following the enactment of legislation in 2018, the various institutes of technology began a merger process to create five technological universities:
* Technological University Dublin
* Munster Technological University
* Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest
* Atlantic Technological University
* South East Technological University

, Dundalk Institute of Technology announced plans to join an existing TU. It had previously investigated the possibility of becoming a TU in its own right.

<doc id="480621" wikidata="Q2875759" url="?curid=480621" title="Lehigh Valley International Airport">
<text>Lehigh Valley International Airport , formerly Allentown–Bethlehem–Easton International Airport, is a domestic airport located in Hanover Township in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. Lehigh Valley International Airport is located in the center of the Lehigh Valley, roughly northeast of Allentown, northwest of Bethlehem, and southwest of Easton.

Lehigh Valley International Airport is the fourth-busiest passenger airport in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Harrisburg international airports. In 2023, the airport was utilized by 930,946 passengers, the most since 2004, and 275,605,699 pounds of cargo traffic, an all-time cargo traffic record for the airport. With over 83,000 flights in 2022, Lehigh Valley International Airport is the third-busiest airport in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in terms of total flight takeoffs and landings.

The airport is also heavily utilized for the transport of air cargo due to the growth of e-commerce and its proximity to major population centers on the East Coast. As of 2022, the airport ships more than 237 million pounds of cargo. Companies such as Amazon.com are using the airport, a major factor in its growth. In the Summer of 2024, the airport set an all-time summer passenger traffic record with 297,000 passengers using the airport between June and August.

== History ==
===20th century===
Lehigh Valley International Airport opened in 1929. Scheduled airline flights began on September 16, 1935, with flights by United Airlines&#x27; Boeing 247s. The airport hangar initially served as the passenger terminal. The first terminal building at the airport was built in 1938 as part of a Works Progress Administration project.

====World War II====
During World War II, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s V-5 flight training program was conducted at the airport in conjunction with ground training held at nearby Muhlenberg College. The headquarters of Group 312 of the Civil Air Patrol was based at the airport. One of its activities was to provide a courier service for cargo defense plants. Allentown-based pilots patrolled the Atlantic coastline during World War II and were active in recruiting young men for the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s air cadet program.

In January 1944, work on a new runway was completed, and a Class A U.S. Weather Bureau station also was installed. About 1,000 Naval Aviation Cadets were trained in 1943, and civil and military air traffic both increased. 

In late July 1944, the War Production Board approved the construction of a second-story addition to the airport&#x27;s administration building. The building housed the Lehigh Aircraft Company, the weather bureau station, the Civil Aeronautic communications station, and the office and waiting room of United Airlines. In August, the V-5 flight training program ended when the Navy decided to move all flight training to naval air bases under Navy pilots.

====Expansion====
In April 1946, the Lehigh Airport Authority was created to own and manage the airport. The October 1946 command and general staff diagram shows four runways forming an asterisk: runway 1 was 2680 feet long, runway 6 was 4000 feet, runway 9 was 3800 feet and runway 14 was 3100 feet.

Construction began on the present terminal in 1973. The project, designed by Wallace &amp; Watson, was completed in 1976.

Construction on a new passenger terminal began in 1948 and was finished in 1950. Allentown–Bethlehem–Easton (ABE) Airport, as it was then called, had flights on United and TWA since 1947, and Colonial Airlines since 1949. Douglas DC-4s and DC-6s appeared after runway 6 was extended to 5,000 feet. TWA left in 1967, replaced by Allegheny Airlines; Colonial&#x27;s successor Eastern Air Lines remained until 1991. Republic Airlines&#x27; McDonnell Douglas DC-9&#x27;s offered nonstop flights to Detroit and were continued by Northwest Airlines after Northwest&#x27;s acquisition of Republic. Northwest also offered one-stop flights to Detroit with a stop in Harrisburg.

===21st century===

Regional partners replaced the successor Northwest around 2003. Delta Air Lines started nonstop flights to Atlanta and Harrisburg in 1991 and later added flights to Cincinnati, initially operated by Delta until changing to Delta Connection carrier Comair.

In 2012, Frontier Airlines started twice-a-week nonstop Airbus A319 flights to Orlando International Airport; they ended in 2013. Allegiant Air now flies nonstop from Lehigh Valley to Orlando via Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB) in nearby Sanford, Florida.

In 2009 and 2010, the most recent terminal renovations were completed in two phases:

* Phase I (April 2009). Cost: $7,253,235; PENNDOT grant amount: $3 million; general contractor: Lobar, Inc. (Dillsburg, Pennsylvania); architect: Breslin, Ridyard, Fadero Architects (Allentown); square footage of the Phase I project: 24,000 sq.ft., 7,000 sq.ft. of which is new space.
* Phase II (November 2010). Cost: about $7,225,000; PENNDOT grant amount: $3.5 million; general contractor: E.R. Stuebner Construction, Inc. (Reading); architect: Breslin, Ridyard, Fadero Architects (Allentown); square footage of renovated space: 33,600 sq.ft.

On May 26, 2016, Solar Impulse 2 (SI2), piloted by Bertrand Piccard, completed the 13th leg from Dayton, Ohio of the first around the world (43,041 km) fuel-less flight by this solar-powered plane with a landing at ABE. On June 11, 2016, André Borschberg began the 14th leg (ABE to JFK, which included a dramatic Statue of Liberty flyover). While at ABE, an open house was held for public viewing of the SI2 aircraft.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2023–2027 categorizes Lehigh Valley International Airport as a small hub primary commercial service facility. In 2019 to 2023, the FAA categorized the airport as a &quot;non-hub primary&quot; and previous years it was categorized as a &quot;small hub.&quot;

After several years of falling passenger counts in the early 2000s, the airport has lately experienced a significant rebound in passenger totals due to it being an alternative to the comparatively congested Philadelphia International and Newark Liberty International airports, its facility improvements, a rapidly growing regional population, carrier expansions, especially Allegiant Air, and multiple new routes being added for popular destinations and major hubs across the country. 

In 2019, the airport was utilized by 911,970 passengers, which represented an increase of 15.01% over its use the previous year, in 2018. Much of this growth has been driven by Allegiant Airlines&#x27; expansion at the airport.

One of the shortest scheduled jet flights in the contiguous U.S. operated between Lehigh Valley Airport (ABE) and Philadelphia International Airport (PHL). Piedmont Airlines operating as American Eagle regularly flew an Embraer ERJ-145 regional jet on the 55-mile route on behalf of American Airlines via a code sharing agreement. The average time in the air was 20 minutes. It was the shortest flight in the contiguous United States until 2017, when it was surpassed by United Express&#x27;s San Francisco to Santa Rosa route in 2017, which had an average time in the air of 16 minutes. The ABE-PHL flights ended in 2020.

As of 2024, the airport provides incoming and outgoing direct flights over Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines. In June 2024, the airport served 95,589 passengers, an increase of 17.1 percent over that of June 2023.

In April 2024, Lehigh Valley International Airport was named the second-best small airport in the nation in a &quot;Newsweek&quot; readers poll.

== Facilities ==
The airport covers at an elevation of . It has two asphalt runways: 6/24 is by . The second, 13/31, is by . 

The airport has nine gates to service the passenger flights and six holding spots for cargo aircraft, which largely include A300F cargo aircraft with FedEx and Boeing 767s with Amazon Air.

In 2022, the airport had 83,760 aircraft operations, the third-most among all Pennsylvania airports. 

In May 2020, 137 aircraft were based at the airport: 73 single-engine, 11 multi-engine, 52 jet, and one helicopter.

In 2022, the airport handled of freight and mail.

The Lehigh-Northampton Airport Authority (LNAA) also operates two nearby general aviation airports, Allentown Queen City Municipal Airport on Lehigh Street in Allentown and Braden Airpark in Easton.

=== Fire department ===
Aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) is provided by the LNAA ARFF Department, which consists of seven full-time and 5 part-time personnel, operating from a 13,000 sq.ft. facility commissioned in October 2003.

=== Cargo ===
Amazon.com used the Lehigh Valley International Airport (LVIA) as one of the first five locations in the United States for their Amazon Air shipping service. LVIA was selected for the pilot concept of the program due to its close proximity to large population centers, cost-effectiveness, and robust infrastructure.

For similar reasons as Amazon, FedEx Ground selected an area that was once owned by the Lehigh Northampton Airport Authority to construct its largest terminal in the country as of 2016.

ABE currently has six cargo parking spots for cargo operations.

<text>Liberal-Progressive was a label used by a number of candidates in Canadian elections between 1925 and 1953. In federal and Ontario politics there was no Liberal-Progressive Party, as such. The term generally referred to candidates endorsed by Liberal and Progressive constituency associations or to individual candidates who claimed the label, sometimes running against a straight Liberal or straight Progressive candidate. In Manitoba, a party existed with this name provincially, and Liberal-Progressives ran federally in Manitoba under the leadership of Robert Forke, with the support of the Liberal Party.

==Federal politics==
With the Progressive Party&#x27;s 1921 electoral breakthrough, Canadian federal politics operated under a &quot;three party system&quot; for the first time. The Liberal Party under William Lyon Mackenzie King tried to deal with this situation by co-opting the Progressives, offering to form a coalition with them. The Progressive Party refused. But by 1926, the party had split and some Progressives decided to support the Liberals, running as Liberal-Progressive or Liberal-Labour-Progressives, or similar variations. This phenomenon occurred particularly in the 1925 election and the 1926 election. A number of Liberal-Progressive Members of Parliament (MPs) became full-fledged Liberals in the 1930s. There was one Independent Liberal-Progressive candidate in 1925.

In the 1925 election, only one candidate ran—unsuccessfully—under the Liberal Progressive banner. There was also one Independent Liberal-Progressive candidate that year.

In the 1926 election, twelve candidates ran as Liberal-Progressives and eight were elected, including seven in Manitoba and one in Saskatchewan.There were three unsuccessful candidates in Ontario. An eighth Manitoba Liberal-Progressive, Robert Forke, who was the group&#x27;s leader, was acclaimed in a by-election later in the year and was appointed to the Cabinet. These candidates were not opposed by the Liberal Party in the election and ran with the understanding that they would sit with and support the Liberals in Parliament and attend Liberal caucus meetings. Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberals alone did not have a majority of seats in the House of Commons after the 1926 election, but were able to form a minority government with the support of the Liberal-Progressives in the house. This government lasted for four years. The Liberal-Progressives also had their own caucus meetings and developed their own politics on certain issues, particularly in relation to agriculture. For example, they were critical of the 1927 federal budget for not reducing tariffs, a long-time Progressive demand.

In the 1930 election, eight Liberal-Progressives ran in Manitoba, but only two were elected. One candidate was defeated by a Liberal candidate.

In the 1935 election, five Liberal-Progressives ran in Manitoba, four of whom were elected. One of these won over a Liberal candidate, while the defeated Liberal-Progressive was defeated by a Liberal. In Ontario, Hughes Cleaver won Halton on the Liberal-Progressive ticket, but afterwards allied himself with the Liberals.

In the 1940 election, two Liberal-Progressives ran in Manitoba, of whom one was elected. Two Liberal-Progressives ran in Ontario. Both were elected.

&quot;National Liberal Progressive&quot; was a political label used in the federal election of 1940, by W. Garfield Case, in Grey North electoral district in Ontario. Case listed &#x27;Insurance manager&#x27; as his profession. He won 2,434 votes, 15.5% of the popular vote. The election was won by the Liberal Party candidate, William P. Telford. When Telford resigned on 9 December 1944, to provide a vacancy for A.G.L. McNaughton, Case ran and won the 5 February 1945 by-election as the candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

William Gilbert Weir was the longest-lasting Liberal-Progressive MP, winning his first election in the riding of Macdonald in Manitoba in 1930. He was re-elected as a Liberal-Progressive in 1935 and 1940. In 1945, 1949 and 1953, he was elected as a Liberal-Progressive for the riding of Portage-Neepawa, and was the sole candidate to run as under the Liberal-Progressive label in those elections. Weir served as Chief Government Whip from 1945 to 1953 and parliamentary assistant to Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent from 1953 to 1957. He was defeated in the 1957 election, the first in which he ran as a Liberal.

Five MPs in all sat as Liberal-Progressives: Edgar Douglas Richmond Bissett, Robert Forke, James Allison Glen, George William McDonald and William Gilbert Weir. Forke and Glen became ministers in Liberal cabinets (Glen also served as Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada) while Weir served as government whip for a number of years.

Forke was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1929 and was the sole Liberal-Progressive to ever sit in that body.

==Alberta==
In Alberta, one candidate ran under the Liberal-Progressive banner during the 1926 Alberta election. Mr A.D. Campbell won 252 votes, in the Camrose district, and came in fourth place.

==Ontario==

In Ontario, an electoral coalition was formed in 1934 between the provincial Liberals under Mitchell Hepburn, and the Progressive bloc of Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) under Harry Nixon. Nixon had been elected with the United Farmers of Ontario (UFO) and served in cabinet of E. C. Drury as Provincial Secretary and Registrar of Ontario when the party formed government in 1919. By the end of its term in 1923, the party had changed its name to the Progressives and after the 1926 election, Nixon was the sole former member of the Drury cabinet left in the Legislature.

In the coalition formed in 1934, the Progressive group ran as &quot;Liberal-Progressives&quot;. They were eventually absorbed into the Ontario Liberal Party. Even before 1934, several candidates ran and were elected under the Liberal-Progressive banner:

:* Thomas Blakelock of Halton was elected on that ticket in 1929, 1934 and 1937.
:* Frederick Sandy of Victoria South was elected as a UFO MLA in 1919, defeated in 1923 and returned to serve as a Liberal-Progressive from 1926-1929; 
:* Merton Elvin Scott of Oxford South served as a Liberal-Progressive MLA from 1926 to 1929; and 
:* UFO MLA David Munroe Ross of Oxford North was re-elected as a Liberal-Progressive in 1926 and 1929.

It was only in the 1934 election that a formal alliance between the Progressives and Liberals began, returning four Liberal-Progressive MLAs (Nixon, Douglas Campbell of Kent East, Roland Patterson of Grey North and James Francis Kelly of Muskoka).

Liberal-Progressive leader Harry Nixon was provincial secretary in Liberal Premier Mitchell Hepburn&#x27;s cabinet from its inception in 1934. He and Kelly ran for re-election as Liberals in the 1937 provincial election and were returned to office. Nixon served as Leader of the Liberal Party from 1943 to 1944 and briefly as Premier on Ontario in 1943, until his government&#x27;s defeat in the 1943 election,and would continue sitting as a Liberal until his death in 1961. Kelly would sit as a Liberal until leaving politics in 1945. Two remaining Liberal-Progressive MLAs were returned in that election, Campbell and Patterson. Campbell was not returned in the 1943 election while Patterson was re-elected as a straight Liberal.

While he never sat as a Liberal-Progressive, Farquhar Oliver was first elected as a UFO MLA in 1926 and sat informally with the Liberal caucus beginning in 1934, when Hepburn formed government, while remaining a UFO MLA until 1941 when he officially joined the Liberals and was appointed to cabinet as minister of public works. Oliver would serve as leader of the Ontario Liberal Party from 1945 to 1950 and again from 1954 to 1958 and would continue to sit in the legislature as a Liberal until 1967 when he retired from office.

==Manitoba==

In Manitoba, the Progressives and Liberals merged in 1932 under Premier John Bracken and ran as &quot;Liberal-Progressives&quot;. Bracken continued as Premier until 1943, when he was replaced by Stuart Garson. In 1948, Garson was replaced by Douglas Campbell.

Although the party was dominated by its &quot;Progressive&quot; wing, it had become popularly known as the Liberal Party by the 1940s. (The national Progressive Party had vanished by this time.) It changed its name to the Manitoba Liberal Party in 1961, against only scattered objections from diehard Progressives.

<text>Unus the Untouchable (also known as Gunther Bain, born Angelo Unuscione) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Unus is a mutant, and is named for his ability to consciously project an invisible force field which protects him from harm.

==Publication history==

Unus first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #8 (November 1964), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Angelo Unuscione was born in Milan, Italy. After his arrival in the United States, he legally changed his name to Gunther Bain. He became a wrestler, and, when the Beast briefly left the X-Men, he was able to defeat him in a wrestling match. Once in America, he sought out the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to join them. He turned criminal, and joined with the Brotherhood as they fought the X-Men. During the battle, his powers were enhanced by a shot fired from Beast&#x27;s gun, increasing his power beyond his ability to control it, and making him unable to touch anything. He promised to reform, and his normal power level was restored by the Beast. He became a good friend of the Blob, and they teamed up together on various schemes, such as posing as the X-Men and framing them for robbery, before both mutants went their separate ways. It was revealed the alien invader Lucifer was behind this, and had made sure the Beast&#x27;s weapon did not work on Unus anymore.

===Factor Three/Brotherhood===
Unus then joined the villainous organization Factor Three in a conspiracy to conquer Earth. They fought the X-Men, but turned against the Mutant Master when the latter was exposed as an extraterrestrial. Unus later visited Ogre at their Mt. Charteris base. However, shortly after he was captured by Sentinels alongside several others mutants, but was later released, after which he teamed with the Blob and Mastermind as agents of the second Secret Empire; they were defeated by the Beast, and then held prisoner by the Secret Empire. Unus then joined an incarnation of Magneto&#x27;s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. As a member of the Brotherhood, Unus joined in their battle against the X-Men and Kruger. Alongside the Brotherhood, Unus battled the Defenders, but Magneto and the Brotherhood were reduced to infancy by their team member Alpha the Ultimate Mutant. Unus and the others were kept at Muir Island. When the Brotherhood was reverted to adulthood and reorganized, Unus teamed with the Vanisher, Blob and Mastermind and fought alongside the group against the Champions. However, he left the team disheartened. He came in conflict with Doc Samson, and Power Man, and then embarked on a New York crime spree, but was defeated by Iron Fist and Power Man.

Not long after, Unus decided to retire from the life of the organized supervillain, deciding to use his talents in less &quot;lofty&quot; ways; he was making a living as a wrestler. At some point, he fathered the Canadian mutant Radius. It is also believed that the Acolyte Carmella Unuscione is either his daughter or sister, but no official confirmation of this has ever been given.

Coming out of retirement and teaming with his friend the Blob again, Unus discovered, during a fight against the Hulk, that his powers had become nearly uncontrollable, and his field was smashed by the Hulk. Unus lost complete control of his powers, and his force-field became so thick that it repulsed the very oxygen molecules in the air until he suffocated and passed out. He fell into the arms of the Blob who, believing Unus to be dead, went on an angry rampage through Brooklyn leading to a fight with both Spider-Man and Black Cat.

===Genosha===
Years later, Unus reappeared on the decimated island of Genosha, traumatized by the devastation and speaking of &quot;ghosts.&quot; Usually arrogant and somewhat fearless, due in no small part to his invulnerable force field, he was shaken by apparent &quot;ghosts&quot; being able to pass through it. At some point, he stopped seeing them, and returned to his former hubris.

Unus later formed his own band of mutant rebels (which included Toad and Paralyzer), trying to survive on the harsh island that Genosha had become. They most commonly had arguments with Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto, and surprisingly never recognized Magneto out of costume. In their first confrontation, the mutant known as Freakshow ends up literally swallowing Unus in order to end the tensions. His powers protected him.

Unus leads Appraiser and Stripmine, two superhuman poachers, to Genosha which caused him to be at odds with all the remaining mutants on Genosha.

===House of M and death===
Unus stayed on the island until before the House of M, and was depowered after the events of Decimation.

Unus is later found by Quicksilver on Genosha. Quicksilver granted him his powers back, however in an altered form. The Office of National Emergency soon stepped in and took the mists from Quicksilver and his daughter. Lockjaw managed to teleport Luna and Pietro away before ONE could capture them, leaving a battle between the Inhumans and the repowered mutants of Genosha. During the battle Unus faced Karnak, who was amazed that he could not break Unus&#x27;s shield. However, Unus&#x27;s powers soon evolved beyond his control and a pink metallic shell began to form all over his body. Both the Inhumans and the repowered mutants tried to save Unus&#x27;s life, but it was too late. As Unus&#x27;s field began to dissolve, it was discovered that he had died from lack of oxygen.

===Necrosha===
Unus was among the many on the island of Genosha who have been resurrected by Eli Bard and his version of the techno-organic virus. He appeared repowered by the T.O. virus.

===Spider-Man and the X-Men===
Unus was confirmed to be alive and repowered again after the events of Necrosha when he attacked the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning before being defeated by the then-new Special Class Guidance Counselor Spider-Man.

===X of Swords===
Unus became one of the many former villains granted amnesty on the mutant nation of Krakoa. During the Dawn of X event &quot;X of Swords&quot;, Unus escorted Apocalypse&#x27;s grandchild Summoner through Otherworld to Arakko along with Banshee. He was taken captive by Amenthi forces during an ambush that also gravely injured Banshee. He was rescued by a Krakoan team and safely transported back to Krakoa.

==Powers and abilities==
Unus the Untouchable is a mutant that possessed the power to generate a field of invisible psionic energy around his body. The field acts to deflect objects and even energy beams, and can withstand great concussive force. Normally, Unus can control the force field at will and certain types of radiant energy, such as sunlight, can pass through the field, as do air and sound waves (at least within certain unknown limits). Unus has deflected beams of energy, objects of high mass, objects traveling at high speed and telepathy, including that of Charles Xavier. Unus was at one point vulnerable to the Beast&#x27;s ray gun that augmented his force field power beyond his control; in later years Unus&#x27;s power again became uncontrollable due to unknown reasons, finally repelling air molecules.

Unus&#x27;s force field was not impenetrable, and could be disrupted by a sufficiently powerful force. The Incredible Hulk did this on two occasions, the first time by simply shattering it with a punch enhanced by his anger. When they battled again in Australia during the House of M crossover, the Hulk created a sonic boom by clapping his hands, which resonated with Unus&#x27;s force field and caused shockwaves that stunned the villain. Although it was temporarily disrupted, the force field would eventually regenerate itself.

Unus is also an athletic man and an expert wrestler. Unus sometimes carried a baseball bat, which, when encased in his force field, can deliver blows with superhuman force.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
Unus in the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; (also known as Earth-295) was a Prelate in Apocalypse&#x27;s Infinites. Prelate Unus&#x27;s appearance was cut short, however, as he was frozen by Iceman and shattered.

===House of M===
In the &quot;House of M&quot;, Unus was a lieutenant of Exodus and was eradicating the remaining human population in Australia. However, while tracking several runaway humans he stumbled upon and attempted to destroy a tribe of Aboriginal people who had adopted the Hulk into their midst. In the ensuing conflict, Unus was severely injured and put in a hospital.

===Ultimate Marvel===
Unus also appeared briefly within the Ultimate Marvel universe as a member of Magneto&#x27;s Brotherhood. In this version, he had some sort of astral projection powers. In &quot;The Ultimates 3&quot;, Unus is charged with protecting Magneto&#x27;s citadel from the Ultimates. His forcefield deflected blows from Thor, but, ultimately, Thor broke through and apparently killed Unus for defying a god.

===X-Men Noir===
In &quot;X-Men Noir&quot;, Angelo Unuscione is an unpowered human and a dangerous mob boss known as &quot;Unus the Untouchable&quot;. Unus struggled with the Brotherhood for control of New York City. For his own security, he only let a few select people be near him, and hence his name, &quot;untouchable.&quot; He eventually became a target for the Brotherhood after Unus refused to join in the Brotherhood&#x27;s and Sebastian Shaw&#x27;s illegal act in land profiting. He was to be kill by Peter Magnus when he was about to leave the city for Central City by airship. However, Unus avoided his assassination due to the X Men, and was taken to safety to Welfare Island, where he would be transferred to Washington, D.C., and under protection from the federal authorities. As Unus was about to leave with the X Men, he was killed by Eric Magnus and his men, who appeared out of nowhere.

<text>Absorbance is defined as &quot;the logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power through a sample (excluding the effects on cell walls)&quot;. Alternatively, for samples which scatter light, absorbance may be defined as &quot;the negative logarithm of one minus absorptance, as measured on a uniform sample&quot;. The term is used in many technical areas to quantify the results of an experimental measurement. While the term has its origin in quantifying the absorption of light, it is often entangled with quantification of light which is &quot;lost&quot; to a detector system through other mechanisms. What these uses of the term tend to have in common is that they refer to a logarithm of the ratio of a quantity of light incident on a sample or material to that which is detected after the light has interacted with the sample.

The term absorption refers to the physical process of absorbing light, while absorbance does not always measure only absorption; it may measure attenuation (of transmitted radiant power) caused by absorption, as well as reflection, scattering, and other physical processes. Sometimes the term &quot;attenuance&quot; or &quot;experimental absorbance&quot; is used to emphasize that radiation is lost from the beam by processes other than absorption, with the term &quot;internal absorbance&quot; used to emphasize that the necessary corrections have been made to eliminate the effects of phenomena other than absorption.

== History and uses of the term absorbance ==

=== Beer-Lambert law ===
The roots of the term absorbance are in the Beer–Lambert law. As light moves through a medium, it will become dimmer as it is being &quot;extinguished&quot;. Bouguer recognized that this extinction (now often called attenuation) was not linear with distance traveled through the medium, but related by what we now refer to as an exponential function.

If formula_1 is the intensity of the light at the beginning of the travel and formula_2 is the intensity of the light detected after travel of a distance the fraction transmitted, is given by

formula_3

where formula_4 is called an attenuation constant (a term used in various fields where a signal is transmitted though a medium) or coefficient. The amount of light transmitted is falling off exponentially with distance. Taking the natural logarithm in the above equation, we get

formula_5

For scattering media, the constant is often divided into two parts, separating it into a scattering coefficient formula_6 and an absorption coefficient obtaining

formula_7

If a size of a detector is very small compared to the distance traveled by the light, any light that is scattered by a particle, either in the forward or backward direction, will not strike the detector. (Bouguer was studying astronomical phenomena, so this condition was met.) In such case, a plot of formula_8 as a function of wavelength will yield a superposition of the effects of absorption and scatter. Because the absorption portion is more distinct and tends to ride on a background of the scatter portion, it is often used to identify and quantify the absorbing species. Consequently, this is often referred to as absorption spectroscopy, and the plotted quantity is called &quot;absorbance&quot;, symbolized as Some disciplines by convention use decadic (base 10) absorbance rather than Napierian (natural) absorbance, resulting in: formula_9 (with the subscript 10 usually not shown).

=== Absorbance for non-scattering samples ===
Within a homogeneous medium such as a solution, there is no scattering. For this case, researched extensively by August Beer, the concentration of the absorbing species follows the same linear contribution to absorbance as the path-length. Additionally, the contributions of individual absorbing species are additive. This is a very favorable situation, and made absorbance an absorption metric far preferable to absorption fraction (absorptance). This is the case for which the term &quot;absorbance&quot; was first used.

A common expression of the Beer&#x27;s law relates the attenuation of light in a material as: where formula_10 is the absorbance; formula_11 is the molar attenuation coefficient or absorptivity of the attenuating species; formula_12 is the optical path length; and formula_13 is the concentration of the attenuating species.

=== Absorbance for scattering samples ===
For samples which scatter light, absorbance is defined as &quot;the negative logarithm of one minus absorptance (absorption fraction: formula_14) as measured on a uniform sample&quot;. For decadic absorbance, this may be symbolized as If a sample both transmits and remits light, and is not luminescent, the fraction of light absorbed remitted and transmitted add to 1: Note that and the formula may be written as For a sample which does not scatter, and yielding the formula for absorbance of a material discussed below.

Even though this absorbance function is very useful with scattering samples, the function does not have the same desirable characteristics as it does for non-scattering samples. There is, however, a property called absorbing power which may be estimated for these samples. The absorbing power of a single unit thickness of material making up a scattering sample is the same as the absorbance of the same thickness of the material in the absence of scatter.

=== Optics ===
In optics, absorbance or decadic absorbance is the &quot;common logarithm&quot; of the ratio of incident to radiant power through a material, and spectral absorbance or spectral decadic absorbance is the common logarithm of the ratio of incident to spectral radiant power through a material. Absorbance is dimensionless, and in particular is not a length, though it is a monotonically increasing function of path length, and approaches zero as the path length approaches zero.

==Mathematical definitions==

===Absorbance of a material===
The absorbance of a material, denoted , is given by

formula_15

where

* formula_16 is the radiant flux by that material,
* formula_17 is the radiant flux by that material, and
* formula_18 is the transmittance of that material.

Absorbance is a dimensionless quantity. Nevertheless, the absorbance unit or AU is commonly used in ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy and its high-performance liquid chromatography applications, often in derived units such as the milli-absorbance unit (mAU) or milli-absorbance unit-minutes (mAU×min), a unit of absorbance integrated over time.

Absorbance is related to optical depth by

formula_19

where is the optical depth.

===Spectral absorbance===
Spectral absorbance in frequency and spectral absorbance in wavelength of a material, denoted and respectively, are given by

formula_20

where

* formula_21 is the spectral radiant flux in frequency by that material;
* formula_22 is the spectral radiant flux in frequency by that material;
* formula_23 is the spectral transmittance in frequency of that material;
* formula_24 is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength by that material;
* formula_25 is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength by that material; and
* formula_26 is the spectral transmittance in wavelength of that material.

Spectral absorbance is related to spectral optical depth by

formula_27

where
* is the spectral optical depth in frequency, and
* is the spectral optical depth in wavelength.

Although absorbance is properly unitless, it is sometimes reported in &quot;absorbance units&quot;, or AU. Many people, including scientific researchers, wrongly state the results from absorbance measurement experiments in terms of these made-up units.

== Relationship with attenuation ==

===Attenuance===
Absorbance is a number that measures the &quot;attenuation&quot; of the transmitted radiant power in a material. Attenuation can be caused by the physical process of &quot;absorption&quot;, but also reflection, scattering, and other physical processes. Absorbance of a material is approximately equal to its attenuance when both the absorbance is much less than 1 and the emittance of that material (not to be confused with radiant exitance or emissivity) is much less than the absorbance. Indeed,

formula_28

where
* formula_29 is the radiant power transmitted by that material,
* formula_30 is the radiant power attenuated by that material,
* formula_31 is the radiant power received by that material, and
* formula_32 is the radiant power emitted by that material.

This is equivalent to

formula_33

where
* formula_34 is the transmittance of that material,
* formula_35 is the of that material,
* formula_36 is the emittance of that material.

According to the Beer–Lambert law, , so
* formula_37
and finally
* formula_38

===Attenuation coefficient===
Absorbance of a material is also related to its &quot;decadic attenuation coefficient&quot; by

formula_39

where
* is the thickness of that material through which the light travels, and
* is the &quot;decadic attenuation coefficient&quot; of that material at .

If &quot;a&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is uniform along the path, the attenuation is said to be a &quot;linear attenuation&quot;, and the relation becomes
formula_40

Sometimes the relation is given using the &quot;molar attenuation coefficient&quot; of the material, that is its attenuation coefficient divided by its molar concentration:

formula_41

where
* is the &quot;molar attenuation coefficient&quot; of that material, and
* is the molar concentration of that material at .

If is uniform along the path, the relation becomes

formula_42

The use of the term &quot;molar absorptivity&quot; for molar attenuation coefficient is discouraged.

==Measurements==

===Logarithmic vs. directly proportional measurements===
The amount of light transmitted through a material diminishes exponentially as it travels through the material, according to the Beer–Lambert law (). Since the absorbance of a sample is measured as a logarithm, it is directly proportional to the thickness of the sample and to the concentration of the absorbing material in the sample. Some other measures related to absorption, such as transmittance, are measured as a simple ratio so they vary exponentially with the thickness and concentration of the material.

===Instrument measurement range===
Any real measuring instrument has a limited range over which it can accurately measure absorbance. An instrument must be calibrated and checked against known standards if the readings are to be trusted. Many instruments will become non-linear (fail to follow the Beer–Lambert law) starting at approximately 2 AU (~1% transmission). It is also difficult to accurately measure very small absorbance values (below ) with commercially available instruments for chemical analysis. In such cases, laser-based absorption techniques can be used, since they have demonstrated detection limits that supersede those obtained by conventional non-laser-based instruments by many orders of magnitude (detection has been demonstrated all the way down to ). The theoretical best accuracy for most commercially available non-laser-based instruments is attained in the range near 1 AU. The path length or concentration should then, when possible, be adjusted to achieve readings near this range.

===Method of measurement===
Typically, absorbance of a dissolved substance is measured using absorption spectroscopy. This involves shining a light through a solution and recording how much light and what wavelengths were transmitted onto a detector. Using this information, the wavelengths that were absorbed can be determined. First, measurements on a &quot;blank&quot; are taken using just the solvent for reference purposes. This is so that the absorbance of the solvent is known, and then any change in absorbance when measuring the whole solution is made by just the solute of interest. Then measurements of the solution are taken. The transmitted spectral radiant flux that makes it through the solution sample is measured and compared to the incident spectral radiant flux. As stated above, the spectral absorbance at a given wavelength is

formula_43

The absorbance spectrum is plotted on a graph of absorbance vs. wavelength.

An Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy#Ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer will do all this automatically. To use this machine, solutions are placed in a small cuvette and inserted into the holder. The machine is controlled through a computer and, once it has been &quot;blanked&quot;, automatically displays the absorbance plotted against wavelength. Getting the absorbance spectrum of a solution is useful for determining the concentration of that solution using the Beer–Lambert law and is used in HPLC.

==Shade number==
Some filters, notably welding glass, are rated by shade number (SN), which is 7/3 times the absorbance plus one:

formula_44

For example, if the filter has 0.1% transmittance (0.001 transmittance, which is 3 absorbance units), its shade number would be 8.

<doc id="480635" wikidata="Q1851885" url="?curid=480635" title="Sega Meganet">
<text>Sega Meganet, also known as the Net Work System, was an online service for the Mega Drive in Japan and later Brazil. Utilizing dial-up Internet access, Meganet was Sega&#x27;s first online multiplayer gaming service, and functioned on a pay to play basis. The system functioned through the use of a peripheral called the Mega Modem and offered several unique titles that could be downloaded, and a few could be played competitively with friends. In addition, it shared technology and equipment with more serious services such as the Mega Anser, used for banking purposes. Though the system was announced for North America under the rebranded name &quot;Tele-Genesis&quot;, it was never released for that region. Ultimately, the Meganet service would be short-lived, lasting approximately a year before it was discontinued, but would serve as a precursor to the Sega Channel and XBAND services, as well as a predecessor to online gaming services for video game consoles. Retrospective feedback praises the attempt by Sega to introduce online gaming, but criticizes the service for its logistical issues and lack of titles.

==History==

Sega&#x27;s 16-bit console, the Mega Drive was released in Japan on October 29, 1988, though the launch was overshadowed by Nintendo&#x27;s release of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; a week earlier. Positive coverage from magazines &quot;Famitsu&quot; and &quot;Beep!&quot; helped to establish a following, but Sega only managed to ship 400,000 units in the first year. In order to draw a larger audience, Sega began work on an Internet service, similar to what Nintendo had attempted with the Family Computer Network System for the Family Computer.

Released in Japan on November 3, 1990, at a cost of JP¥12,800 (approximately US$100) for the equipment, as well as an additional ¥800 monthly, access began to the Meganet service by way of the Mega Modem, a peripheral which attaches to the rear EXT 9-pin port on the rear of the console. From the modem, a cable runs to a dual-port connector, which connects into a telephone line. The Mega Modem also came packaged with a cartridge which allowed for access to the Meganet game library, and approximately six titles were available at launch. It was capable of connection speeds of up to 1200bit/s. The service had also been announced in North America under the name &quot;Tele-Genesis&quot; at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (Winter CES) in January 1990, and advertised in publications such as &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, but it was never released for the region.

As another way of attempting to expand the audience for the Mega Drive in Japan, Sega introduced the Mega Anser, a system designed for use with Nagoya Bank in Japan, in 1990. Packaged as an all-in-one system including a Mega Drive, Mega Modem, Mega Anser cartridge and keypad, the system allowed for transactions such as balance inquiries, transfers, and loan information. It initially retailed at a cost of JP¥34,000 including the home console, and a version with an additional printer retailed for ¥72,800.

Due to the system&#x27;s low number of titles, prohibitively high price, and the Mega Drive&#x27;s lack of success in Japan, the Meganet system proved to be a commercial failure. By 1992, the Mega Modem peripheral could be found in bargain bins at a reduced price, and a remodeled version of the Mega Drive released in 1993 removed the EXT 9-pin port altogether, preventing the newer model from being connected to the Meganet service.

In 1995, the Meganet internet service launched in Brazil. Its main focus in the region was e-mail, although by 1996 the service was capable of online multiplayer, along with chat features. Similar to the Mega Anser, a home banking product was also released for the region. Meganet hardware and services were provided through Sega&#x27;s distributor in the region, Tectoy.

==Game library==

The Meganet service utilized its own library of titles, independent of the Genesis library. Most of these games never received a cartridge release; however, &quot;Columns&quot;, &quot;Fatal Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;Flicky&quot;, and &quot;Teddy Boy Blues&quot; each later saw cartridge versions. Several Meganet games would also later appear in the &quot;Game no Kanzume&quot; series, released for the Mega-CD exclusively in Japan. Most games for the service were small, at around 128KB per game, due to the limits of Internet connection speeds at the time. Downloads were estimated to take about five to eight minutes to complete.

All of the Meganet games were available through the Sega Game Library, accessed through the Meganet modem. Due to issues with long-distance charges through the use of telephone lines, as well as seconds of lag time between commands, only two games featured competitive play: &quot;Tel-Tel Stadium&quot; and &quot;Tel-Tel Mahjong&quot;, with the remainder of the games available for single players via download. Due to Sega&#x27;s reluctance to commit to releasing the service in North America, third-party developers in that region were unwilling to invest in developing games specifically for Meganet. This resulted in a low number of titles created for the service.

==Reception and legacy==
Retrospective feedback on the Sega Meganet service is mixed, praising the early initiative to develop online gaming for video consoles, but criticizing its implementation via use of telephone lines and issues with Sega&#x27;s lack of developers for the service. Adam Redsell of IGN commented on the basic features of the service, and despite noting that Meganet received only a few games, stated &quot;[T]hat&#x27;s pretty damn impressive for 1990&quot;. He also notes the influence of Sega in the development of online gaming, with the Meganet service as their first attempt, and credits the Meganet&#x27;s successor, Sega Channel, with helping to spread broadband Internet.

The telephone line network which the Meganet ran on has been criticized for its logistical issues in online gaming. According to &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;Even though the TeleGenesis modem has been announced, it has yet to appear and the real usefulness of a device that is used only to play games with friends over the phone lines remains questionable (both have to have the modem, the phone lines must be clear, the phone bills will be a problem if it’s a long-distance call, etc.)&quot; The same issues that plagued the Meganet over the use of phone lines for Internet connectivity would later resurface when Catapult Entertainment launched the XBAND service in 1994.

Ken Horowitz of Sega-16 took note of Sega&#x27;s reluctance to commit to releasing the service in North America as part of the reason for its lack of titles, noting, &quot;Companies were most likely waiting for confirmation of the modem’s release before they began to commit themselves, and as time has attested, few were waiting to go ahead with development in light of Sega&#x27;s &#x27;wait and see&#x27; attitude.&quot; Horowitz went on to criticize this issue as a problem Sega would have again with the 32X in 1994, stating, &quot;History would repeat itself in the harshest of manners only five years later. Sega&#x27;s expectations of third party support for something it showed little enthusiasm for were entirely unrealistic and ultimately meant that no games would be in the pipeline.&quot; Former Sega console hardware research and development head Hideki Sato stated that Sega made very little money on sales of the Mega Modem, but that Sega learned from the experience to develop future network opportunities for the Sega Saturn.

<doc id="480637" wikidata="Q2381298" url="?curid=480637" title="Adapidae">
<text>Adapidae is a family of extinct primates that primarily radiated during the Eocene epoch between about 55 and 34 million years ago.

Adapid systematics and evolutionary relationships are controversial, but there is fairly good evidence from the postcranial skeleton (everything but the skull, or cranium) that adapids were stem strepsirrhines (members of the group including the living lemurs, lorises, and bushbabies). In particular, the anatomy of the adapid wrist and ankle (e.g., position of the groove for the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus, the presence of a sloping talo-fibular facet) show derived similarities with those of living strepsirrhines. However, adapids lacked many of the anatomical specializations characteristic of living strepsirrhines, such as a toothcomb, a toilet-claw on the second pedal digit, and a reduction in the size of the promontory branch of the internal carotid artery.

There are two major branches of adapids, subfamily Adapinae (adapines) and subfamily Caenopithecinae (caenopithecines). Caenopithecines are sometimes assigned to their own family, Caenopithecidae.

<doc id="480638" wikidata="Q721001" url="?curid=480638" title="Phantasy Star II">
<text>is a science fantasy role-playing video game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. It was released in Japan in 1989 and North America and Europe in 1990. It was later ported to a variety of different platforms. An updated remake, , was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2005 in Japan.

&quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; is the second installment in Sega&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; series and serves as a sequel to the original &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; for the Master System. &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; takes place 1,000 years after the events of its predecessor and follows the journey of a government agent named Rolf and his friends, who are on a mission to discover why the protector of the planet Mota, Mother Brain, has started malfunctioning.

&quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; was the first video game to use a 6 mega-bit cartridge, making it the biggest video game on a console at the time. Since its release &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; has been the subject of critical acclaim.

== Gameplay ==
Gameplay is similar to the original &quot;Phantasy Star&quot;, the first game in the series. Its battle system is turn-based as well as menu-based, allowing the player to choose commands for their party of up to four characters. Each of the eight characters has a different set of preferred weapons and armor, as well as techniques, suited to the character&#x27;s job. The player must defeat enemies in the overworld and in dungeons to advance in the game.

The game abandoned the first-person view that the first game used for dungeons and battles. &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; instead uses a top-down perspective for exploration and a third-person view in battles.

== Plot ==
Somewhere deep within the Andromeda Galaxy lies the Algol Star System. The parent star, Algol (referred to as &quot;Algo&quot; by this point in the timeline), has three planets orbiting about it. First is Palm (&quot;Palma&quot;), the home of the government. Governors, treasurers, and great thinkers dwell here in great ivory towers, away from the hubbub of everyday life. Next is Mota (&quot;Motavia&quot;), the shining jewel. Once a dry desert planet infested with ant lions, Mota has been transformed into a blue and green tropical paradise. Domed farms grow crops, and the water is regulated into dammed rivers. Life on Mota is sweet, peaceful, and easy. The people have everything they want and do not need to work. Farthest out is Dezo (&quot;Dezoris&quot;), the ice planet. Little is known about this mysterious and dark planet.

One thousand years have passed since Alis and her friends liberated Algo from the evil Lassic in the previous game; Algo has since prospered under the care of a giant computer called the Mother Brain. The Mother Brain regulates the Climatrol tower which has terraformed Mota, the biosystems lab, and all other things that provide whatever the people in Mota need.

The game begins with the character Rolf recalling a strange recurring nightmare he has been having. In the dream, a young girl who Rolf does not recognize – but who resembles Alis – is battling a demon. Finally, just before the demon would kill her, Rolf awakens. From his home in Paseo, Mota&#x27;s capital, Rolf goes to the central tower to meet with the head of government on Mota, in order to receive his newest mission.

The first threat is an increase in dangerous biomonsters (biologically altered animals). Rolf sets off with his companion Nei, a humanoid with catlike features, to investigate, accompanied by six others with each different, but same purpose. Along the way, the group discovers a human-biomonster hybrid named Neifirst, who reveals that Nei&#x27;s origins are the same as her own. Being part biomonster, she is an outcast from society, causing her to loathe mankind and, because of this, sabotage both Mota&#x27;s climate control system and the biosystems laboratory. Nei confronts Neifirst and battles her in a one-on-one fight, but is defeated and killed. Anguished, Rolf and the remaining party defeat Neifirst, causing the biosystems laboratory to self-destruct and bringing an end to Mota&#x27;s Biomonster hazard.

However, this sets another incident in motion: the explosion of the lab damages the Climatrol equipment and causes the central lake, the residential reservoir of Mota, to overflow with water. To prevent a massive flood, Rolf and his friends decide to open up the surrounding four dams. After unlocking the last one, they are captured by Mother Brain&#x27;s security robots, charged with causing the environmental disaster, and sentenced to death upon the Gaira satellite. However, the satellite malfunctions and collides with Palm, destroying both. Rolf and company are rescued in the nick of time by a space pirate, Tyler.

Now the system&#x27;s most wanted criminals, blamed for Palm&#x27;s destruction and the deaths of its people, the group boards Mota&#x27;s last remaining spacecraft – legacy of a space program now falling into ruins – to the mysterious and dangerous Dezo. Located at a far corner of the planet is the Esper Mansion: upon reaching it, Rolf awakens the legendary Lutz from a long sleep. Lutz reveals the secrets of Rolf&#x27;s past, as well as the dark secret of Mother Brain which relates to the fate and destruction Algo is now facing. In order to save the System, the heroes seek to recover the powerful Nei arsenal, found in four hidden dungeons, capable of defeating the enemies on the spaceship Noah, where Mother Brain resides.

It is eventually revealed that the demon from Rolf&#x27;s original nightmare – Dark Force, Lassic&#x27;s true corruptor and Alis&#x27; enemy a thousand years ago – has corrupted Noah and been behind every threat Rolf has faced, including Mother Brain itself. Rolf confronts the two evil entities and defeats them. After the final battle, Lutz alerts him that there are still people on the ship: they&#x27;re the remaining survivors from Earth. They reveal they created Mother Brain to satisfy their greedy lifestyle at the expense of Algo&#x27;s resources, and a fight between the heroes and the earthmen ensues. The game ends with the outcome unrevealed.

== Release ==

=== Localization changes ===
* Lutz, a refugee Esper who lives in the Esper Mansion on Dezo, aids Rolf and friends in their mission. He is supposed to be the same Esper who accompanies Alis as &quot;Noah&quot; in the original &quot;Phantasy Star&quot;, but as &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; names him Lutz internationally, this connection is lost in translation.
* In the Japanese version, Ustvestia, a musician who teaches the characters the Musik technique, is openly gay; when requested to teach a male character the Musik technique, he comments, &quot;He looks cute&quot;, and charges less than he would for teaching female characters. Any obvious references to this were removed from the American release; he instead comments, &quot;He looks smart&quot; – and still charges less for teaching the male characters.
* While the tracks in the soundtrack are the same for both versions, the snare drums are much louder in the Japanese version.
* In the Japanese version the game is set 942 years after the events of &quot;Phantasy Star I&quot;.

=== Ports ===
&quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; was re-released as a port in two different forms for the Sega Saturn and Game Boy Advance as part of &quot;Phantasy Star Collection&quot;. It was also released on the &quot;Sega Smash Pack Volume 1&quot; for the Dreamcast. It is also part of the &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot; for PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. The game is available in &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The game is also included as part of &quot;Sega Genesis Classics&quot; for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The game was made available through Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console service in 2008. On June 10, 2009, it was released on Xbox Live Arcade under the &quot;Sega Vintage Collection&quot; banner. On August 26, 2010, an iPhone port of the game was released. The port later became available on the iPad and iPod touch as well. On June 22, 2017, Sega made the game available for free through both iTunes and Android.

In October 1993, Atari Corporation filed a lawsuit against Sega for an alleged infringement of a patent originally created by Atari Corp. in the 1980s, and Atari sought a preliminary injunction to stop manufacturing, usage, and sales of hardware and software for the Genesis and Game Gear. On September 28, 1994, both parties reached a settlement involving a cross-licensing agreement to publish up to five games each year across their systems until 2001. &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; was one of the first five games approved from the deal by Sega in order to be converted for the Atari Jaguar, but it was never released.
Phantasy Star II would eventually see a rerelease on the Sega Genesis Mini 2 in October 2022, along with 60 other games. Ported by M2, this version features a few quality of life additions, including a faster run speed, faster combat and animations, and an additional mode where EXP and Meseta (the game&#x27;s in-game currency) are doubled, to eliminate some level grinding. These changes were met with positive reception. 

== Reception and legacy ==
===Contemporary===

Its demonstration at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (Winter CES) in January 1990 received a positive reception. The original &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; game was a big game for its time, and because of the advancements in technology between the Master System and Genesis, &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; featured a much larger cartridge than its predecessor, holding 6 megabits of data, making it the largest game on any game machine up until that time. &quot;RePlay&quot; magazine praised the game for providing a lengthy home video game experience not found in arcades, and reported it could take about 250 hours to complete.

The game was well received by critics upon release. In &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; was described as &quot;one of the best role-playing games yet to be released for any video game system.&quot; &quot;Wizardry&quot; designer Roe R. Adams wrote in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; that &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; was a system seller for the Genesis, stating that its &quot;16-bit graphics are gorgeous, but the real fun lies in the science fiction story plot.&quot; He concluded that it is a &quot;challenging and enjoyable&quot; game with &quot;superb combat and animated graphics.&quot; &quot;Raze&quot; concluded that it is a &quot;challenging quest packed with gameplay.&quot;

=== Retrospective ===
&quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; was a landmark game in its time, &quot;a game of many firsts&quot; according to &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. It was the first RPG for the Mega Drive, and was released in the U.S. two months before the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; for the NES, another key game in the genre&#x27;s popularization in North America.

&quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; is regarded by many as a forerunner for certain aspects of role-playing video games, such as an epic, dramatic, character-driven storyline dealing with serious themes and subject matter, a strategy-based battle system, and the demand for extensive strategy guides for such games (&quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; included one with the game itself). &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot;&#x27;s predominantly science fiction setting was also a major departure for RPGs, which had previously been largely restricted to fantasy or science fantasy settings. The game&#x27;s science fiction story was also unique, reversing the common alien invasion scenario by instead presenting Earthlings as the invading antagonists rather than the defending protagonists. The game&#x27;s strong characterization, and use of self-discovery as a motivating factor for the characters and the player, was a major departure from previous RPGs and had a major influence on subsequent RPGs such as the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. It also made an attempt at social commentary years before the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series started doing the same. &quot;Tor.com&quot; described the worldbuilding as &quot;fantastic, probably the best in any 16-bit era game.&quot;

&quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; has made a number of &quot;greatest games of all time&quot; type lists, including being inducted into GameSpot&#x27;s list of greatest games of all time in 2005. &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at #29 in their &quot;Top Mega Drive Games of All Time&quot; in 1992. In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; ranked it the 30th best console video game of all time, saying it was the best RPG on the Genesis due to its characters, story, enemies, and massive length. In 2003, IGN ranked it as the 92nd top game, choosing &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; for how it &quot;surprised everyone with the death of a major player 1/3 the way&quot; years before &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, in addition to &quot;a balanced experience point system, tough-as-nails bosses, and one of the biggest and most difficult RPG quests that we&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; In 2009, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; called &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot;, along with &quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot;, one of the greatest role-playing games of all time. In 2011, &quot;GamePro&quot; included it in its list of &quot;20 Games That Defined Role-Playing Games&quot;.

Levi Buchanan of &quot;IGN&quot; reviewed the iPhone version in 2010. He praised it as an &quot;awesome game&quot; with a &quot;real sense of discovery&quot; and one of his &quot;favorite final twists in videogames.&quot;

=== Remake ===

A remake, &quot;Phantasy Star Generation 2&quot;, was released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 as a part of &quot;Sega Ages&quot; in 2005. Much like &quot;Phantasy Star Generation 1&quot;, the remake mirrors the events of the original game while adding character development and fleshing out the story in more detail. It featured enhanced graphics, a revised combat system, and a rearranged soundtrack. Other new features included the ability to play the original Mega Drive version, and to load a system file from &quot;Phantasy Star Generation:1&quot; to allow the ability to play as Nei throughout the entire game.

It was originally slated for North American and European release by Conspiracy Entertainment as a part of the &quot;Phantasy Star Trilogy&quot;, a compilation of the remakes of &quot;Phantasy Star&quot;, &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot;, and &quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot;. The compilation&#x27;s future is uncertain, however, since Sega reclaimed the publishing rights for North America and Europe. This is evidenced by the fact that the trilogy no longer appears on Conspiracy Entertainment&#x27;s list of products on their website. Sega has abandoned their plans for a &quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot; remake in favor of a compilation featuring the original iterations of &quot;Phantasy Star I&quot;–&quot;IV&quot;.

Game designer Yasushi Yamaguchi, who was responsible for the &#x27;Mechanical Design&#x27; in the game, expressed interest for a 3D remake.

<doc id="480641" wikidata="Q327005" url="?curid=480641" title="Glanders">
<text>Glanders is a contagious zoonotic infectious disease that occurs primarily in horses, mules, and donkeys. It can be contracted by other animals, such as dogs, cats, pigs, goats, and humans. It is caused by infection with the bacterium &quot;Burkholderia mallei&quot;.

Glanders is endemic in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America. It has been eradicated from North America, Australia, and most of Europe through surveillance and destruction of affected animals and import restrictions. It has not been reported in the United States since 1945, except in 2000, when an American lab researcher had an accidental exposure in the lab. It is a notifiable disease in the UK, although it has not been reported there since 1928.

The term is from Middle English &#x27; or [[Old French]]&#x27;, both meaning glands. Other terms include , , and .

==Presentation==
Signs of glanders include the formation of nodular lesions in the lungs and ulceration of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract. The acute form results in coughing, fever, and the release of an infectious nasal discharge, followed by septicaemia and death within days. In the chronic form, nasal and subcutaneous nodules develop, eventually ulcerating; death can occur within months, while survivors act as carriers.

==Cause and transmission==

Glanders is caused by infection with the &quot;Burkholderia mallei&quot;, usually by ingestion of contaminated feed or water. &quot;B. mallei&quot; is able to infect humans, so it is classed as a zoonotic agent. Transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animal&#x27;s body fluid and tissues and entry is through skin abrasions, nasal and oral mucosal surfaces, or inhalation.

==Diagnosis==
The mallein test is a sensitive and specific clinical test for glanders. Mallein (ATCvet code: ), a protein fraction of the glanders organism (&quot;B. mallei&quot;), is injected intradermopalpebrally or given by eye drop. In infected animals, the eyelid swells markedly in 1 to 2 days.

==Historical cases and potential use in war==
Glanders has been known since antiquity, with a description by Hippocrates around 425 BCE.

From the Middle Ages to the 1900s, glanders was a significant threat to armies. Before the Battle of Blenheim in 1704, glanders may have afflicted and greatly diminished the horses of Marshal Tallard&#x27;s cavalry, helping the Duke of Marlborough win the battle.

Glanders was a significant problem for civilian use of horses, as well. In the 18th-century veterinary hospital at the École Nationale Vétérinaire d&#x27;Alfort, glanders was the most common disease among their equine patients and the one most likely to cause death.

Due to the high mortality rate in humans and the small number of organisms required to establish infection, &quot;B. mallei&quot; is regarded as a potential biological warfare or bioterrorism agent, as is the closely related organism, &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;, the causative agent of melioidosis. During World War I, glanders was believed to have been spread deliberately by German agents to infect large numbers of Russian horses and mules on the Eastern Front. Other agents attempted to introduce the disease in the United States and Argentina. This had an effect on troop and supply convoys, as well as on artillery movement, which were dependent on horses and mules. Human cases in Russia increased with the infections during and after WWI. The Japanese deliberately infected horses, civilians, and prisoners of war with &quot;B. mallei&quot; at the Unit 731 Pingfang (China) Institute and Unit 100 facilities during World War II. The U.S. studied this agent as a possible biological weapon in 1943–44, but did not weaponize it. U.S. interest in glanders (agent LA) continued through the 1950s, except it had an inexplicable tendency to lose virulence in the lab, making it difficult to weaponize. Between 1982 and 1984, the Soviet Union allegedly used weaponized &quot;B. mallei&quot; during the Soviet–Afghan War.

==Vaccine research==
No vaccine is licensed for use in the U.S. Infection with these bacteria results in nonspecific symptoms and can be either acute or chronic, impeding rapid diagnosis. The lack of a vaccine for either bacterium also makes them potential candidates for bioweaponization. Together, with their high rate of infectivity by aerosols and resistance to many common antibiotics, both bacteria have been classified as category B priority pathogens by the US NIH and US CDC, which has spurred a dramatic increase in interest in these microorganisms. Attempts have been made to develop vaccines for these infections, which would not only benefit military personnel, a group most likely to be targeted in an intentional release, but also individuals who may come in contact with glanders-infected animals or live in areas where melioidosis is endemic.

<text>Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT, ) was a major third-level institution in Dublin, Ireland. On 1 January 2019 DIT was dissolved and its functions were transferred to the Technological University Dublin, as TU Dublin City Campus. The institution began with the establishment of the first technical education institution in Ireland, in 1887, and progressed through various legal and governance models, culminating in autonomy under a statute of 1992.

DIT was recognised particularly for degree programmes in Product Design, Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, Engineering, Science, Marketing, Hospitality, Music, Optometry, Pharmaceuticals, Construction, Digital Media and Journalism. It was ranked, in 2014, in Times Higher Education&#x27;s top 100 university-level institutions globally under 50 years old.

Alumni of the Dublin Institute of Technology include a number of Irish writers, artists, politicians and business leaders as well as international figures in the fields of arts, architecture and business.

==History==
===Origins – Dublin&#x27;s technical colleges===

The first of DIT&#x27;s predecessor colleges, the City of Dublin Technical Schools, was founded in 1887 by Arnold Felix Graves.

Over time, other specialised colleges opened, and those which later formed DIT are listed, each with its year of foundation:
* College of Technology, Kevin Street (1887)
* College of Music, Chatham Row (1890)
* College of Commerce, Rathmines (1901)
* College of Marketing and Design, Mountjoy Square (1905)
* College of Technology, Bolton Street (1911)
* College of Catering, Cathal Brugha Street (1941)

===Federal model (1978–1992)===
In 1978 the College of Technology joined with the other five institutions to form the Dublin Institute of Technology, a federation of colleges.

===Unitary college model===
In 1992, Dublin Institute of Technology was established by legislation as a single institution, under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act.

===Towards university status===
An application for university designation in 1996 was declined but with the expert panel viewing the institution as on a trajectory for university designation. Dublin Institute of Technology now has a scope of activities and variety of powers identical to those of a university, and its degrees are recognised as such both in Ireland and internationally. For twenty-five years, DIT had legislative authority to award Bachelor&#x27;s, Master&#x27;s and Doctoral degrees that comply fully with the Irish national qualifications framework originally put in place by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland. DIT awarded Professorships from 2003.

===Technological University status===

In 2014, the institution entered into a formal process which led to its designation as a technological university, jointly with two other institutions, Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown (ITB) and Institute of Technology, Tallaght (ITT). A final application was submitted in April 2018 and the formation of the Technological University Dublin, &quot;TU Dublin&quot;, was approved in July 2018. It was launched 1 January 2019.

===Degree-awarding powers===
In 1975 the University of Dublin entered into an agreement whereby it conferred academic degrees at the colleges that formed Dublin Institute of Technology; this allowed these graduates a vote in the Dublin University constituency for Seanad Éireann representatives. This continued until 1998, when Dublin Institute of Technology was granted its own autonomous degree-awarding powers under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act 1992.

==Academic structure==
DIT&#x27;s predecessor colleges were recognised as centres of excellence in their areas of specialism and, following the establishment of the unitary DIT, their expertise formed the nucleus of an internal structure comprising the following faculties and campuses:
* Faculty of Applied Arts, Mountjoy Square, Rathmines, Clarendon Row, Portland Row, Temple Bar
* Faculty of the Built Environment, Bolton Street and Linenhall
* Faculty of Business, Mountjoy Square and Rathmines, latterly Aungier Street
* Faculty of Engineering, Bolton Street, Kevin Street, Beresford Street
* Faculty of Science, Kevin Street
* Faculty of Tourism and Food, Cathal Brugha Street, Sackville Place and Kevin Street

From 2012 to 2018, DIT was organised into four colleges: Engineering and Built Environment, Business, Science and Health, and Arts and Tourism. These also contributed to the research activities of an overarching Graduate Research School and to four cross-institutional Research Institutes that brought together over seventy research centres and groups. The colleges in turn were divided into 27 Schools.

DIT also had various technology transfer and commercial units.

==Governance==
DIT had a governing body comprising representatives of public, including Dublin Lord Mayors (such as formerly Maurice Ahern and Mary Freehill), social and industrial groups, faculty, staff and students, its final composition was chaired by Professor Tom Collins.

In 1992 Michael O&#x27;Donnell became the first interim president. He was succeeded as president in 1993 by Professor Brendan Goldsmith. From 2003 to 2018 Professor Brian Norton was the second, and last, president.

==Faculty==
Faculty included David Brophy, conductor, Gráinne Mulvey, composer, Bernie Sherlock, conductor, Jane O&#x27;Leary, pianist and composer, John Feeley, guitarist, Kieran Hanrahan, traditional Irish musician, Mike Nielsen, jazz guitarist and composer, Ciarán Cuffe, urban planner, Mairtin Mac Con Iomaire, culinary arts.

Previous faculty members included Pat Kenny, Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ and Newstalk) news and current affairs presenter, Joan Burton, Teachta Dála (TD), Minister for Social Protection, Frank Harte, Irish traditional singer and architect, Hugh McFadden, poet, Seán Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus, politician, Brid Grant, Dean of Arts, University of Connecticut, Desmond Fennell, writer and cultural philosopher, Lelia Doolan, TV and film producer, Peter Sutherland, lawyer and politician. John T. Lewis, mathematician and physicist and Bernadette Greevy, mezzo-soprano.

==Research==
Dedicated research facilities include the Focas Research Institute with extensive spectroscopy, microscopy and holography facilities. It also houses &quot;CREST&quot;; an international centre supported by Enterprise Ireland for paint and surface coating development. Antennae research is associated with the multi-institution &quot;CTVR&quot;; The Centre for Telecommunications Value-added Research. Recently research supported by Science Foundation Ireland in the Dublin Energy Lab, water sciences, air quality, food preservation and environmental health and safety are being co-located in a major new building at the Grangegorman new city centre campus together with an additional &quot;Hothouse&quot; start-up business incubator for new DIT spin-off companies. Hothouse nurtured, amongst other firms, Smart Wall Paint and Moletest.

===National Optometry Centre===
The National Optometry Centre (NOC) located at the junction of Kevin Street and New Bride Street is the only such centre in Ireland. The main function of the NOC is to facilitate clinical training for Optometry students. The centre is developing specialised clinics in areas such as paediatrics, low vision and contact lenses. It was planned to also offer eye examinations, spectacles and contact lenses to the general public. Free eye examinations are offered to DIT students.

==Partnerships==
In common with other Irish universities, DIT validates programmes taught in other institutions in Dublin such as Pulse College, based in the Windmill Lane Studios, and the British and Irish Modern Music Institute BA programme.

There are student exchange and joint research programmes with several universities in India, China, Brazil, Australia, the US and Europe. DIT are also partners in the Mozambique Eyecare Project. As part of the project, an undergraduate course in Optometry was established at Universidade Lurio, Nampula. The first of its kind in Mozambique. Other partners on the project are University of Ulster and International Centre for Eyecare Education.
There are also links with Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences across several subjects, with Columbia College Chicago in design and media and with Purdue University across a number of disciplines including a joint master&#x27;s degree programme. There are student and staff exchanges with Grenoble School of Management. DIT accredits programmes at Middle East College in Oman.

==Ranking==
Dublin Institute of Technology was named &quot;Best Institute of Technology&quot; in 2010, 2016 and 2018 by the Sunday Times. It came 94th in the 2014 and 2015 Times Higher Education 100 under 50 Ranking of universities worldwide. It came 157th in the UI
Greenmetric Ranking of World Universities in 2013. The 2012, QS World University Rankings puts DIT in the 451–500 bracket worldwide and in the 350th position for Engineering &amp; Technology; DIT&#x27;s best result in the same ranking was when it came 326th in the worldwide ranking in 2009.

==Community outreach==
Embedded in the life of Dublin city centre, DIT had several links with its neighbouring communities and schools. The Access and Civic Engagement service provided programmes that enabled those from traditionally under-represented groups to study at DIT. These included a number of access routes for children in secondary schools where there had been no tradition of continuing to third level education. It also made even earlier interventions in schools, for example the &#x27;Pathways through Education&#x27; supports students in making the transition into secondary school.

==Campus==
Dublin Institute of Technology is spread across 10 locations in Dublin city, which are currently being amalgamated into a central campus at Grangegorman.

===Grangegorman Campus===

The Institute plans to consolidate to a single campus in the centre of Dublin, at Grangegorman. The campus is located 1 km from O’Connell Street, with Smithfield to the south; Stoneybatter to the west; Broadstone to the east; and Phibsboro and the North Circular Road to the north. As of 2014, the Grangegorman campus was home to students in Fine Art, Product Design, Visual Communications, Photography and Social Sciences. The development of the new consolidated city-centre campus is undertaken by the Grangegorman Development Agency.

The campus is served by the Luas (Green Line) and the closest station is Grangegorman. An adjacent station, DIT Broadstone, is also operational.


==Students==
Dublin Institute of Technology had circa 20,000 students.

===Students&#x27; Union===
The DIT Students&#x27; Union (DITSU) was the representative body for students in DIT. It was set up to &quot;ensure there is a student voice at each level within the college&quot; and all students within the institute were automatically members. DITSU, which was a member of the Union of Students in Ireland, also promoted clubs, societies and other non-academic activities and provided a range of services for its members. The union also had representation in the governance of DIT and, under the 1994 DIT Amendment Act, the membership of DIT&#x27;s governing body was expanded to include two students (one male and one female). DITSU&#x27;s website won a &quot;Best Students&#x27; Union Website&quot; award in 2012.

When, in January 2019, DIT joined with ITB and ITT to form Dublin Technical University, a member referendum was held. The referendum was passed and, in February 2019, DITSU was joined under a new constitution (with the equivalent unions in ITB and ITT) to form the Technological University Dublin Students&#x27; Union (TUDSU).

===Sport===

As of 2014, DIT had more than 40 student clubs, including Gaelic Athletic Association, football, handball, rifle shooting, waterpolo, archery, basketball, kite surfing and cricket.

In 2013, Dublin Institute of Technology won the Sigerson Cup, the premier Gaelic Football Championship among Irish Higher Education institutions. DIT&#x27;s hurlers won the Kehoe Cup in 2007 and the Walsh Cup Shield in 2013.

Outdoor and indoor sports facilities were developed at Grangegorman and at Broom Bridge.

<text>In spectroscopy, an isosbestic point is a specific wavelength, wavenumber or frequency at which the total absorbance of a sample does not change during a chemical reaction or a physical change of the sample. The word derives from two Greek words: &quot;iso&quot;, meaning &quot;equal&quot;, and &quot;sbestos&quot;, meaning &quot;extinguishable&quot;.

== Interpretation ==

An isosbestic point corresponds to an absorbance formula_1 at a fixed wavelength formula_2 that remains fixed. The absorbance can be written as sum of absorbances of each species (Beer–Lambert law)
formula_3
where formula_4 the concentration of species i, formula_5 the optical path length. 
By definition, an isosbestic point can be interpreted as a fixed linear combination of species concentrations,
formula_6
i.e. an isobestic point is a conservation law. 

The IUPAC gold book provides as an example the reaction
formula_7
which will lead to an isosbestic point if 
formula_8

Isosbestic points can be observed in a variety of techniques (for instance UV-VIS, IR, NMR). In UV-VIS, an isosbestic point is often interpreted as implying the occurrence of a single linearly independent reaction. 

The simplest examples of isosbestic points involve only two species, but isosbestic points do not imply the participation of only two species (e.g. the IUPAC example involves 5 species), which is a common misconception. 
== Isosbestic plot ==
When an isosbestic plot is constructed by the superposition of the absorption spectra of two species (whether by using molar absorptivity for the representation, or by using absorbance and keeping the same molar concentration for both species), the isosbestic point corresponds to a wavelength at which these spectra cross each other.

A pair of substances can have several isosbestic points in their spectra.

When a 1-to-1 (one mole of reactant gives one mole of product) chemical reaction (including equilibria) involves a pair of substances with an isosbestic point, the absorbance of the reaction mixture at this wavelength remains invariant, regardless of the extent of reaction (or the position of the chemical equilibrium). This occurs because the two substances absorb light of that specific wavelength to the same extent, and the analytical concentration remains constant.

For the reaction:

:formula_9

the analytical concentration is the same at any point in the reaction:

:formula_10.

The absorbance of the reaction mixture (assuming it depends only on X and Y) is:

:formula_11.

But at the isosbestic point, both molar absorptivities are the same:

:formula_12.

Hence, the absorbance 

:formula_13

does not depend on the extent of reaction (i.e., on the particular concentrations of X and Y)

The requirement for an isosbestic point to occur in this example is that the two species involved are related linearly by stoichiometry, such that the absorbance is invariant at a certain wavelength. It can now also readily be seen that one should not expect an isosbestic point for two successive reactions:

:formula_14

As we then would need there to be a wavelength formula_15 at which all three spectra intersect simultaneously: 

:formula_16.

It would be very unlikely for three compounds to have extinction coefficients that are linearly related in this way by chance.

==Applications==

In chemical kinetics, isosbestic points are used as reference points in the study of reaction rates, as the absorbance at those wavelengths remains constant throughout the whole reaction.

Isosbestic points are used in medicine in a laboratory technique called oximetry to determine hemoglobin concentration, regardless of its saturation. Oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin have (not exclusively) isosbestic points at 586 nm and near 808 nm.

Isosbestic points are also used in clinical chemistry, as a quality assurance method, to verify the accuracy in the wavelength of a spectrophotometer. This is done by measuring the spectra of a standard solution at two different pH conditions (above and below the p&quot;K&quot;a of the substance). The standards used include potassium dichromate (isosbestic points at 339 and 445 nm), bromothymol blue (325 and 498 nm) and congo red (541 nm). The wavelength of the isosbestic point determined does not depend on the concentration of the substance used, and so it becomes a very reliable reference.

One example of the use of isosbestic points in organic synthesis is seen in the photochemical A/D-corrin cycloisomerization ring closure reaction, which was the key step in the Eschenmoser / ETH Zürich vitamin B12 total synthesis. The isosbestic points provide proof for a direct conversion of the seco-corrin complex to the metal-free corrin ligand without intermediary or side products (within the detection limits of UV/VIS spectroscopy).
