<text>The Eyre Affair is the debut novel by English author Jasper Fforde, published by Hodder and Stoughton in 2001. It takes place in an alternative 1985, where literary detective Thursday Next pursues a master criminal through the world of Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s 1847 novel &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Fforde had received 76 rejections for earlier works before being accepted by a publisher. Critical reception of this novel was generally positive, remarking on its originality.

==Plot summary==
In a parallel universe, England and Imperial Russia have fought the Crimean War for more than a century; although now a republic (with entertainer George Formby as its president), England still also has a parliamentary government, although heavily influenced by the Goliath Corporation (a powerful weapon-producing company with questionable morals); and Wales is a separate, socialist nation. The book&#x27;s fictional version of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; ends with Jane accompanying her cousin, St. John Rivers, to India in order to help him with his missionary work. Society publicly debates literary questions (especially the question of Shakespearean authorship), sometimes inspiring gang wars and murder. Regular law enforcement agencies still exist, alongside new specialized agencies under the single organization SpecOps (Special Operations). The more than 20 branches include SpecOps 12, the Chronoguard, who police all events related to time travel, and SpecOps 27, the Literary Detectives, or &quot;LiteraTecs&quot;, who deal with all literature-related crimes.

The Crimean War is a cold conflict with both sides at a stalemate but too stubborn to call for peace. A peace movement in Britain is gaining popularity. Meanwhile, Goliath has been contracted to create a plasma rifle codenamed &quot;STONK&quot; to overpower the Russians. The weapon should be capable of destroying a tank with a single blast. Goliath promises that STONK will soon be standard issue to the British military.

The plot revolves around Thursday Next, a single, thirty-six-year-old woman who is a veteran of the Crimean War and a literary detective who lives in London with her pet dodo Pickwick. (Dodos have been recreated, as have Neanderthals, due to advanced genetic engineering technology on this alternate Earth). She is privately against the continuation of the war, as her brother was killed in action and her then fiancé Landen Parke-Laine lost a leg in combat. The trauma of the war led to the end of her relationship with Parke-Laine several years prior.

As the story begins, Thursday is promoted to assist in the capture of a wanted terrorist, Acheron Hades, her former university professor who has become a mysterious criminal mastermind. Thursday is the only living person who can recognize him, and nearly captures him during a stakeout, but Hades possesses several superhuman abilities, such as mental manipulation and extreme durability, and uses those powers to withstand her gunfire. He evades capture and kills Thursday&#x27;s entire team. During the capture attempt she is shot, but a copy of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; stops Hades&#x27;s bullet. A mysterious stranger aids her until the paramedics arrive, leaving behind a handkerchief monogrammed with the letters &quot;E.F.R.&quot; and a 19th-century style jacket. Next recognizes these items as belonging to Edward Fairfax Rochester, a fictional character from &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. During a flashback to her childhood, Thursday remembers a seemingly supernatural event, whereby she was able to physically enter the world of the novel and briefly became acquainted with Rochester.

While recovering in hospital, she learns that, after fleeing the scene, Hades was seemingly killed in a car accident. She also meets a time-traveling future version of herself, who warns her that Hades survived the accident, and instructs her to take a LiteraTec job in her home town of Swindon. She takes the job, and while visiting her family there, she discovers that her brilliant Uncle Mycroft and Aunt Polly have created the Prose Portal, a device that allows people to enter works of fiction. At home, she renews an acquaintance with her ex-fiancé Parke-Laine. She also meets, and is forced to work with, a high-ranking Goliath operative named Jack Schitt, who is similarly investigating Hades.

Hades, meanwhile, steals the original manuscript of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;. He also kidnaps Mycroft, Polly, and the Prose Portal in order to blackmail the literary world; any changes made to the plot of a novel&#x27;s original manuscript will change all other copies. To demonstrate his demands are serious, Hades kills Mr Quaverley, a minor character from the original manuscript of &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;. When his demands are not met, he stages a theft of the original manuscript of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and kidnaps Jane for another ransom demand. This causes the text of all copies of the &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; novel to abruptly end at the moment of Jane&#x27;s kidnapping, roughly halfway through the book.

Next and Jack Schitt independently trace Hades to Wales. She rescues Mycroft and the Prose Portal, and returns Jane to the novel. However, she finds Aunt Polly stuck in one of Wordsworth&#x27;s poems, and learns that Hades has gone into the original text of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; carrying the scrap of paper on which Polly is imprisoned. Next pursues Hades. After several weeks in the novel (which pass in the outside world much more quickly, as the book rewrites itself after Jane is returned) and much trouble, she succeeds in killing Hades and recovering the poem with Polly in it. In the process, Thornfield Hall is burned, Rochester&#x27;s mad wife Bertha falls to her death, and Rochester is grievously injured. Thursday also discovers that the characters in the book must continually relive their lives, with full knowledge of how events turn out, and are unable to alter any of them. Thus, Rochester must repeatedly suffer the devastating loss of Jane when she runs away from him upon discovering his secret marriage. Thursday, who has befriended Rochester, resolves to change the ending of the book to a happy one. She changes events to reunite Jane and Rochester (in other words, she alters the ending to match the actual ending to &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;).

Returning to her own world, Next uses the Prose Portal to release her Aunt Polly, while Jack Schitt reveals that his interest is in the device. Goliath had never been able to perfect STONK as a feasible weapon. Therefore, with their deadline to deliver the weapons to the military, he had resolved to extract working STONKs from the weapon&#x27;s manual, itself a work of fiction, as the weapons don&#x27;t work. Thursday reluctantly agrees to let Schitt use the portal for this endeavor, but switches the book connected to the portal to be the text of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot;. When the portal opens, she pushes Schitt inside, and traps him there, while Mycroft destroys the portal.

Using her new celebrity status, Next enters a televised debate between supporters and opponents of the continuation of the Crimean War. Supporters of the war assume that Goliath&#x27;s plasma rifles will be sufficient to guarantee victory. But in the debate, Next publicly reveals that the plasma rifles do not work. This forces England to rethink its position, which leads to peace negotiations and an end to the war.

Next shows up at the church where Parke-Laine is about to be married to another woman, but Rochester&#x27;s lawyer interrupts the wedding to reveal that the bride is already married. Next and Parke-Laine are reconciled and marry instead. Next&#x27;s father, a renegade agent from SpecOps-12, the ChronoGuard, turns up to dispense some fatherly advice to his daughter. The novel ends with Next facing an uncertain future at work: public reaction to the new ending for &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is positive, but there are other repercussions, including Goliath&#x27;s fury.

==Reception==
The book was generally acclaimed, with critics calling it &quot;playfully irreverent&quot;, &quot;delightfully daft&quot;, &quot;whoppingly imaginative&quot;, and &quot;a work of ... startling originality&quot;.

The &quot;genre-busting&quot; novel spans numerous types of literature, with critics identifying aspects of fantasy, science fiction, mystery, satire, romance, and thriller. This led one critic to jokingly suggest that Fforde &quot;must have jotted a bundle of unrelated ideas on slips of paper&quot;, and, &quot;instead of tossing them in a hat and choosing a few topics as the focus of his story, [he] grabbed the whole hat.&quot; Fforde&#x27;s quirky writing style has led to comparisons with other notable writers, most frequently Douglas Adams, for similar &quot;surrealism and satire&quot;, and Lewis Carroll, for similar &quot;nonsense and wordplay&quot;.

Reviewers have compared Fforde to other authors, including Woody Allen, Sara Paretsky, and Connie Willis. One critic wondered if Fforde was more &quot;Monty Python crossed with Terry Pratchett, or J. K. Rowling mixed with Douglas Adams.&quot; The novel was praised for its fast-paced action, wordplay, and &quot;off-centre humour&quot;.

Mary Hamilton of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the experience as 
&quot;the page opens like a trapdoor and you simply fall through. The Eyre Affair takes that feeling, the moment you lose the sense of yourself and become engrossed in the story, and creates high adventure and wild drama around the porous boundaries between fiction and real life.&quot;

Some reviewers criticised the novel for &quot;convoluted&quot; plots and &quot;dangling details&quot;, as well as inconsistent dialogue that &quot;can veer from wittily wicked to non-sequitur&quot;, and minor characters who &quot;drift in and out of scenes&quot;.

<doc id="466471" wikidata="Q181951" url="?curid=466471" title="Earl of Carrick">
<text>Earl of Carrick (or Mormaer of Carrick) is the title applied to the ruler of Carrick (now South Ayrshire), subsequently part of the Peerage of Scotland. The position came to be strongly associated with the Scottish crown when Robert the Bruce, who had inherited it from his maternal kin, became King of Scots in the early 14th century. Since the 15th century, the title of Earl of Carrick has automatically been held by the heir apparent to the throne, thus the current holder of the title is Prince William, Duke of Rothesay.

==Early rulers==

The earldom emerged in 1186, out of the old Lordship of Galloway, which had previously encompassed all of what is now known as Galloway as well as the southern part of Ayrshire. Though the Lords of Galloway recognised the King of Scots as their overlord, their lordship was effectively a separate kingdom, and had its own laws. The first Lord recorded is Fergus, who died in 1161 leaving two sons: Uchtred and Gille Brigte (Gilbert). As was the custom then, the two brothers shared the lordship and the lands between them. In 1174, they joined with King William the Lion in his invasion of Northumberland. However, after King William was taken prisoner by the English, the Galwegians broke into rebellion. Uchtred, who remained loyal to the Scottish king, was savagely murdered by Gille Brigte&#x27;s son Máel Coluim, and Gille Brigte took control of the entirety of Galloway. In 1175, King William was restored to liberty, and he marched an army into Galloway to bring justice upon Gille Brigte. However, he seems to have contented himself with exacting a fine, leaving Gille Brigte to go unharmed.

In 1176, Gille Brigte obtained an agreement with King Henry II of England, in which he became his vassal; in exchange, he paid the English king the then enormous sum of £919 9s. and gave his son Duncan (Donnchadh) as a hostage. Gille Brigte then spent the next decade carrying out devastating raids on King William&#x27;s territory, with the protection of the English.

Gille Brigte&#x27;s death in 1185 was the signal for general turmoil amongst the Galwegians. Roland, son of the murdered Uchtred, defeated the supporters of Gille Brigte in 1185, and planted forts across Galloway to secure his authority. This angered King Henry, and he marched a large force to Carlisle in preparation for invasion. However, war was averted at a meeting between Roland, William and Henry, when it was agreed that Roland would rule the main part of Galloway, while Gille Brigte&#x27;s son Duncan would rule the northern section, known as Carrick. Duncan agreed to these terms, and renounced all claims to the Lordship of Galloway, becoming the first Earl of Carrick.

Duncan married Avelina, daughter of Alan, High Steward of Scotland. His grandson Niall&#x27;s eldest daughter Marjorie succeeded him, becoming Countess of Carrick in her own right. She married firstly Adam de Kilconquhar. In 1269, Adam journeyed to the Holy Land under the banners of King Louis IX of France, as part of the Eighth Crusade. He never returned, dying of disease at Acre in 1270. The next year, the widowed Countess happened to meet Robert de Brus hunting in her lands. According to legend, Marjorie imprisoned Robert until he agreed to marry her. They were married at Turnberry Castle, without their families&#x27; knowledge or the requisite consent of the King. When news got out, Alexander III seized her castles and estates, but she later atoned for her foolishness with a fine, and Robert was recognised as her husband and Earl of Carrick &quot;jure uxoris&quot;. They had five sons and five daughters: Robert, Edward, Thomas, Alexander, Nigel, Isabel, Mary, Christina, Matilda and Margaret.

Turnberry Castle, situated on the coast of Carrick, was a key strategic site in medieval Scotland. As the seat of the Earls of Carrick, it allowed control over the surrounding lands and the Firth of Clyde, making it vital for defense and military operations. It played a role in Robert de Brus early campaigns during the Wars of Scottish Independence, serving as a gathering point for his supporters.

==Royal earls==
Marjorie and Robert were succeeded by their eldest son. When the old House of Dunkeld became extinct, this Robert, known as &quot;the Bruce&quot;, became a principal candidate for the throne as the great-great-great-great-grandson of David I. He was crowned at Scone in 1306, causing his Scots titles (Earl of Carrick and Lord of Annandale) to merge into the Crown. The title of Baron Bruce in the Peerage of England, in so far as it existed, &quot;would either have been forfeited in 1306, or after the death ... of ... King David II , 22 Feb 1371, would, according to modern doctrine, have fallen into abeyance between [Robert I&#x27;s] daughters and coheirs, the sisters of the late King.&quot;

Around 1313, King Robert made his younger brother Edward the Earl of Carrick. Edward had no issue, save a natural son he had by Lady Isabella Strathbogie, daughter of John, Earl of Atholl. The title therefore became extinct on his death at the Battle of Faughart in 1318.
After briefly being held by Robert&#x27;s son David prior to his accession to the throne, the title was granted in 1332 to Alexander, Edward&#x27;s bastard. However, Alexander was killed the next year at the Battle of Halidon Hill and the title again became extinct.

In 1368, King David created his great-nephew John Stewart the Earl of Carrick. David died unexpectedly in 1371. He had no children, meaning he was succeeded by his nephew Robert Stewart, John&#x27;s father. After Robert&#x27;s death in 1390, John succeeded him, taking the regnal name Robert III; thus the Earldom of Carrick again merged with the Crown.

The title was next held by Robert III&#x27;s son David, who was also created Duke of Rothesay and Earl of Atholl. David died childless in 1402, and the Earldom was regranted to his brother James; however he was generally known by the higher title Prince or Great Steward of Scotland. James acceded to the throne in 1406, and his titles merged with the Crown.

In 1469, the Scottish Parliament passed an Act declaring that the eldest son of the king and heir to the throne would automatically hold the earldom, along with the dukedom of Rothesay. After the Union of the Crowns of Scotland and England, the dukedom and earldom have been held by the eldest son and heir apparent of the monarchs of Great Britain. Thus, the current Duke of Rothesay and Earl of Carrick is Prince William, Duke of Rothesay.

==Creation of 1628==
In 1628, King Charles I created John Stewart the Earl of Carrick. He had already been made Lord Kincleven in 1607, also in the Peerage of Scotland. He was a younger son of Robert, Earl of Orkney, bastard son of King James V; thus, he was Charles&#x27;s half-great-uncle. This title was deemed not to conflict with the Earldom of Carrick held by the heir to the throne, as it referred not to the province in Ayrshire, but to the lands of Carrick on Eday in Orkney.

John Stewart married Lady Elizabeth Southwell, daughter of Charles Howard, Earl of Nottingham, and widow of Sir Robert Southwell. By her, he had one daughter, Margaret. He is also known to have had two natural children: a son, named Henry, and a daughter, whose name is unknown. As he had no legitimate son, his titles became extinct on his death around 1645.

<text>ALM Antillean Airlines (), and later Air ALM, was the main airline of the Netherlands Antilles between its foundation in 1964 and its shut-down in 2001, operating out of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao. It was based at Hato International Airport.

==History==

ALM Antillean Airlines was founded on August 1, 1964, by the conversion from KLM West-Indisch Bedrijf (West Indies Division). ALM operated as a part of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, who wanted to make Curaçao the hub for their American operations and to provide an American link between the Far East and Europe. KLM did this with the flight of the &quot;Snip&quot;. ALM started with three Convair 340s and served seven destinations. In addition to the airline business, ALM also provided catering and airline servicing for other companies using the Curaçao and Aruba airports. Its main destinations were Aruba, Bonaire, St Maarten, St Kitts, Maracaibo, Barranquilla and Caracas. Due to the surge in tourism, ALM quickly grew, and the Convairs were replaced by two Douglas DC-9-15s jets (ex KLM) and two brand new turboprop Fokker F27-500 series. New destinations were added, and an ex Viasa DC-9 was also added to the fleet.

The period of 1968 and 1969 was crucial for ALM. By January 1, 1969, the Antillean government took a 96% share from KLM and ALM became a state-owned company. An ex-KLM Douglas DC-8 was chartered to further use the booming tourist industry. Now ALM was able to fly directly to New York and Miami. Later on, Panama and Costa Rica were added as destinations. The New York to St Maarten route (1970 to 1973) was flown with a chartered Boeing 727-100 provided by Braniff International Airlines and also at one point with an Overseas National Airways (ONA) McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30.

The Fokker F-27s were replaced by a third DC-9-15 also from KLM and ALM became an all-jet passenger airline for a short time. During this time in August 1972, a Douglas DC-6B was purchased for the cargo routes. Windward Islands&#x27; Winair was acquired, with its fleet of turboprop, STOL capable de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter (series 300 aircraft), by the Antillean government. It became apparent that on the short flights to Aruba and Bonaire, the DC-9 jet was not cost-effective. A temporary solution was found in the shape of two Twin Otter 100 series. For a while, ALM Twin Otter flights between Aruba-Bonaire-Curaçao were labeled &quot;ABC Commuter&quot;. After a bumpy start the Twin Otter became a success with the passengers and two further machines (series 300) were added. In the years 1973 through 1978, ALM made a total profit of ANG14.3M. Their &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; was to maintain airways between the islands of the Netherlands Antilles, and to promote tourist trade by providing transport.

In 1975, ALM replaced its older DC-9s with the new McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 series, significantly increasing seating capacity. Two years later, a Boeing 727 was added for additional routes to Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and New York, which were mostly operated as charter flights. During this period ALM grew rapidly and its number of personnel doubled in 1977. A year later, a bilateral agreement between the Antillean government and the US was reached whereby ALM was allowed to take over the routes from KLM to the USA. To cope with the demand two Douglas DC-8-53 jets were leased from Rosenbalm Aviation. Additionally, the Twin Otters were replaced by Short SD-330 commuter turboprop aircraft. In 1978, KLM restarted extensive cooperation with ALM. Two DC-8s were brought into the fleet and served the route Curaçao-New York JFK, where KLM handled the ground services. KLM was still hoping and trying to build a hub with ALM. KLM flights from Curaçao-Amsterdam often had at least an ALM cabin crew on board in those years.
1979 was a turning point for ALM. The low point of the oil prices coupled with slow tourist figures and the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, brought ALM into trouble. Additionally, ALM had to deal with competing businesses from Eastern Air Lines and American Airlines on competing routes. The DC-8 flights were halted and the newly arrived Short 330s were sold off. During 1980 the Boeing 727 and Beech Queen Air left the company and ALM concentrated on its fleet of four DC-9-32s.

In 1982, ALM decided to replace some of its DC-9s with two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jetliners, which were leased from Curaçao Aircraft Leasing Company. A third example was later purchased from Continental Airlines. With business slowly improving, ALM was able to purchase additional airplanes which included the purchase of two elderly Fairchild Hiller FH-227 turboprops from Delta Air Transport for the short-haul routes.

===Cutting costs===
Due to the separate status of the island of Aruba in 1988, ALM had to contend with another competitor concerning the Aruba service: Air Aruba, which was operating two NAMC YS-11 turboprops on flights to Curaçao. By early 1989 ALM was only serving thirteen destinations within the Caribbean basin and also Miami and New York. Although a price war was started between Air Aruba and ALM, this didn&#x27;t last for long. In a few years, the prices for tickets between the three ABC-islands went back to their original levels or even higher. With the sharing of passengers between two competitors, profits on the Aruba-Curaçao route dwindled. Even worse was that the Miami-Curaçao route was also shared. The Miami-Curaçao route was considered one of ALM&#x27;s most profitable routes. From 1970 through 1982, ALM&#x27;s average loss was ANG 1.2 million per year, or a total of 15.6M. As 1973-1978 showed a profit, in the remaining years the average loss was ANG 4.3 million, and probably heavier in the period after 1978.

During the 1990s, ALM managed to stay in business despite stiff US competition and political changes in the aviation industry. de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 regional turboprop aircraft were added to the fleet. Early 1991 KLM re-invested into ALM with some minor shares. However, due to a lack of government and public interest, ALM could not keep up and slowly went into a dire financial situation. By the year 2000, things were so bad that ALM was on the verge of bankruptcy. KLM had stopped its participation with ALM concerning the Amsterdam-Curaçao flights. Worse for ALM, the KLM flights to Europe and South America now were transferred to Bonaire&#x27;s Flamingo International Airport, leaving the just-open ALM catering building at Curaçao Hato airport unused. ALM went into bankruptcy by early September 2001 and was then replaced by Dutch Caribbean Airlines, an all-new company using their older DC-9-32s.

==Destinations==
ALM previously served the following destinations during its existence:

===Codeshare agreements===
ALM had formed agreements that extended its route system:
*KLM
*Martinair
*United Airlines

==Fleet==
Over the years, ALM operated the following aircraft types:

==Incidents and accidents==
*ALM Flight 980: Operated via a wet lease by Overseas National Airways (ONA), was a scheduled flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City to Princess Juliana International Airport on St. Maarten. On May 2, 1970, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 (registered N935F) operating the flight ran out of fuel after several unsuccessful landing attempts due to weather conditions, resulting in a water landing and ditching in the Caribbean Sea 48 km (30 mi) off St. Croix and the death of 23 of the 63 people on board.

<text>Earl of Drogheda is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1661 for The 3rd Viscount Moore.

==History==
The Moore family descends from Sir Garrett Moore, a staunch friend of Hugh O&#x27;Neill, the Great Earl of Tyrone, whose submission he facilitated, hosting the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Mellifont in 1603 and ending The Nine Years&#x27; War. He represented Dungannon in the Irish House of Commons, and served as President of Munster. In 1616 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Moore, of Mellefont in the County of Louth. He was further honoured in 1621 when he was made Viscount Moore, of Drogheda, also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was succeeded in 1628 by his son Charles, the second Viscount, who was killed at the Battle of Portlester while fighting for Charles I in the English Civil War. Charles was succeeded by his son Henry, the aforementioned third Viscount, who was raised to an earldom, as Earl of Drogheda, in 1661. The first Earl&#x27;s younger son Henry, the third Earl (who succeeded his elder brother in 1679), assumed the additional surname of Hamilton upon succeeding to the estates of his brother-in-law, Henry Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Clanbrassil. In a feast of egotism, he built and named Henry Street, Moore Street, Earl Street, Of (or Off) Lane (now Henry Place, and an important escape route for the volunteers fleeing the GPO during the Easter Rising in 1916), and Drogheda Street (part of what is now O&#x27;Connell Street).

The third Earl was succeeded by his grandson Henry, the fourth Earl. The latter died without surviving children at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, Edward, the fifth Earl, who had previously represented Dunleer in the Irish Parliament. Edward&#x27;s son and successor, Charles, the sixth Earl, was a distinguished soldier and politician. In 1791 he was created Marquess of Drogheda in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1801 he was also made Baron Moore, of Moore Place in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him to an automatic seat in the British House of Lords.

His eldest son Charles, the second Marquess, suffered from mental illness, died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, Henry, the third Marquess, the son of Lord Henry Moore, second son of the first Marquess. The third Marquess notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Kildare between 1874 and 1892. He was childless and on his death in 1892 the marquessate and barony of 1801 became extinct. He was succeeded in the remaining titles by his second cousin once removed, Ponsonby Moore, who became the ninth Earl. He was the great-grandson of the Honourable Ponsonby Moore, younger son of the fifth Earl and brother of the first Marquess. The ninth Earl was elected an Irish representative peer in 1899. He was succeeded by his son, Henry, the tenth Earl, who was elected an Irish Representative Peer in 1913. In 1954 Henry was created Baron Moore, of Cobham in the County of Surrey, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him and his descendants to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He was succeeded by his son, Charles, the eleventh Earl, who was a journalist and businessman. As of 2014, the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s son, the twelfth Earl, who succeeded in 1989. The twelfth Earl is a professional photographer under the name &quot;Derry Moore&quot;.

Several other members of the Moore family may also be mentioned. John Moore, great-grandson of Arthur Moore, younger son of the first Viscount, represented Ballynakill in the Irish Parliament. He was the father of 1) John Moore, who represented Ballynakill in the Irish Parliament as well as Newry in the British Parliament, and of 2) Francis Moore, a General in the British Army. The Honourable Robert Moore, younger son of the third Earl, represented County Louth and Belfast in the Irish Parliament.

==Pronunciation==
The title of the earldom is pronounced &quot;Draw-hed-ah&quot; in Ireland and &quot;Draw-dah&quot; in England.

==Seat==
The family seat was Moore Abbey, near Monasterevin, County Kildare. Before that, for a time, the family seat was Mellifont Abbey near Drogheda in County Louth.

<doc id="466494" wikidata="Q753671" url="?curid=466494" title="POKEY">
<text>POKEY, an acronym for Pot Keyboard Integrated Circuit, is a digital I/O chip designed by Doug Neubauer at Atari, Inc. for the Atari 8-bit computers. It was first released with the Atari 400 and Atari 800 in 1979 and is included in all later models and the Atari 5200 console. POKEY combines functions for reading paddle controllers (potentiometers) and computer keyboards as well as sound generation and a source for pseudorandom numbers. It produces four voices of distinctive square wave audio, either as clear tones or modified with distortion settings. Neubauer also developed the Atari 8-bit killer application &quot;Star Raiders&quot; which makes use of POKEY features.

POKEY chips are used for audio in many arcade video games of the 1980s including &quot;Centipede&quot;, &quot;Missile Command&quot;, &quot;Asteroids Deluxe&quot;, and &quot;Gauntlet&quot;. Some of Atari&#x27;s arcade systems use multi-core versions with 2 or 4 POKEYs in a single package for more audio channels. The Atari 7800 console allows a game cartridge to contain a POKEY, providing better sound than the system&#x27;s audio chip. Only two licensed games make use of this: the ports of &quot;Ballblazer&quot; and &quot;Commando&quot;.

The LSI chip has 40 pins and is identified as C012294. The USPTO granted U.S. Patent 4,314,236 to Atari on February 2, 1982 for an &quot;Apparatus for producing a plurality of audio sound effects&quot;. The inventors listed are Steven T. Mayer and Ronald E. Milner.

==Features==
* Audio
** 4 semi-independent audio channels
** Channels may be configured as one of:
*** Four 8-bit channels
*** Two 16-bit channels
*** One 16-bit channel and two 8-bit channels
** Per-channel volume, frequency, and waveform (square wave with variable duty cycle or pseudorandom noise)
** 15 kHz or 64 kHz frequency divider.
** Two channels may be driven at the CPU clock frequency.
** High-pass filter
* Keyboard scan (up to 64 keys) + 2 modifier bits (Shift, Control) + Break
* Potentiometer ports (8 independent ports, each with 8-bit resolution)
* High Resolution Timers (audio channels 1, 2, and 4 can be configured to cause timer interrupts when they cross zero)
* Random number generator (8 bits of a 17-bit polynomial counter can be read)
* Serial I/O port
* Eight IRQ interrupts

== Versions ==
By part number:
* C012294 — Used in all Atari 8-bit computers, including the Atari XEGS, and the Atari 5200 console. The suffix on the chip refers to the manufacturer:
**C012294B-01 — AMI
**C012294-03 — Signetics 
**C012294-19 — National Semiconductor
**C012294-22 — OKI
**C012294-31 — IMP
*137430-001 — Part number sometimes used in Atari arcade machines for POKEY.
* 137324-1221 — Quad-Core POKEY used in Atari arcade machines &quot;Major Havoc&quot;, &quot;I, Robot&quot;, &quot;Firefox&quot;, and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

Atari used several different manufacturers for the chip, however AMI produced most of them in 1983 onward. Early chips were manufactured on a 5 micrometer process, this was later shrunk to 3 micrometers. AMI-produced POKEYs have been reported as having a high failure rate compared with other brands of the chip; the reasons for this are unclear, but speculated to be a fault of the chip packaging or bonding wires. Some limited success in reviving nonfunctional POKEYs by heating them in an oven has been reported. There also exist modern FPGA replacements such as POKEYOne.

==Pinout==

==Registers==
The Atari 8-bit computers map POKEY to the $D2xxhex page and the Atari 5200 console maps it to the $E8xxhex page.

POKEY provides 29 Read/Write registers controlling Sound, Paddle input, keyboard input, serial input/output, and interrupts. Many POKEY register addresses have dual purposes performing different functions as a Read vs a Write register. Therefore, no code should read Hardware registers expecting to retrieve the previously written value.

This problem is solved for some registers by Operating System &quot;Shadow&quot; registers implemented in regular RAM that mirror the values of hardware registers. During the Vertical Blank the Operating System copies the Shadow registers in RAM for Write registers to the corresponding hardware register, and updates Shadow values for Read registers from the hardware accordingly. Therefore, writes to hardware registers which have corresponding shadow registers will be overwritten by the value of the Shadow registers during the next vertical blank.

Reading values directly from hardware at an unknown stage in the display cycle may return inconsistent results (an example: reading potentiometers). Operating System Shadow registers for Read registers would usually be the preferred source of information.

Some Write hardware registers do not have corresponding Shadow registers. They can be safely written by an application without the value being overwritten during the vertical blank. If the application needs to know the last value written to the register then it is the responsibility of the application to implement its own shadow value to remember what it wrote.

In the individual register listings below the following legend applies:
==Audio==
Pokey contains a programmable sound generator; four audio channels with separate frequency, noise and voice level controls.

Each channel has an 8-bit frequency divider and an 8-bit register to select noise and volume.
*AUDF1 to AUDF4 – frequency register (AUDio Frequency)
*AUDC1 to AUDC4 – volume and noise register (AUDio Control)
*AUDCTL – general register, which controls generators (AUDio ConTroL)

POKEY&#x27;s sound is distinctive: when the four channels are used independently, there is noticeable detuning of parts of the 12-tone equal temperament scale, due to lack of pitch accuracy. Channels may be paired for higher accuracy; in addition, multiple forms of distortion are available, allowing a thicker sound. The distortion is primarily used in music for bass parts.

One of the sound-engines developed for the Atari 8-bit family was called the AMP engine (Advanced Music Processor). This was used by the musician Gary Gilbertson.

===Audio Channel Frequency===

The AUDF* registers control the frequency or pitch of the corresponding sound channels. The AUDF* values also control the POKEY hardware timers useful for code that must run in precise intervals more frequent than the vertical blank.

Each AUDF* register is an 8-bit value providing a countdown timer or divisor for the pulses from the POKEY clock. So, smaller values permit more frequent output of pulses from POKEY, and larger values, less frequent. The values $0hex/0dec to $FFhex/255dec are incremented by POKEY to range from $1hex/1dec to $100hex/256dec. The actual audible sound pitch is dependent on the POKEY clock frequency and distortion values chosen. See Audio Channel Control and Audio Control.

====AUDF1 $D200 Write====
Audio Channel 1 Frequency

====AUDF2 $D202 Write====
Audio Channel 2 Frequency

====AUDF3 $D204 Write====
Audio Channel 3 Frequency

====AUDF4 $D206 Write====
Audio Channel 4 Frequency

===Audio Channel Control===

The Audio Channel control registers provide volume and distortion control over individual sound channels. Audio may also be generated independently of the POKEY clock by direct volume manipulation of a sound channel which is useful for playing back digital samples.

====AUDC1 $D201 Write====
Audio Channel 1 Control

====AUDC2 $D203 Write====
Audio Channel 2 Control

====AUDC3 $D205 Write====
Audio Channel 3 Control

====AUDC4 $D207 Write====
Audio Channel 4 Control

Bit 0-3: Control over volume level, from 0 to F.

Bit 4: Forced volume-only output. When this bit is set the channel ignores the AUDF timer, noise/distortion controls, and high-pass filter. Sound is produced only by setting volume bits 0:3 . This feature was used to create digital audio via pulse-code modulation.

Bit 5-7: Shift register settings for noises/distortion. Bit values described below:

Generating random noises is served by reading 8 bits from top of 17-bit shift register. That registers are driven by frequency 1.79 MHz for NTSC or 1.77 MHz for PAL. Its outputs can by used independently by each audio channels&#x27; divider rate.

===AUDCTL $D208 Write===

Audio Control allows the choice of clock input used for the audio channels, control over the high-pass filter feature, merging two channels together allowing 16-bit frequency accuracy, selecting a high frequency clock for specific channels, and control over the &quot;randomness&quot; of the polynomial input.

&quot;1&quot; means &quot;on&quot;, if not described:

;Bit 0: $01: (15 kHz), choice of frequency divider rate &quot;0&quot; - 64 kHz, &quot;1&quot; - 15 kHz
;Bit 1: $02: (FI2 + 4), high-pass filter for channel 2 rated by frequency of channel 4
;Bit 2: $04: (FI1 + 3), high-pass filter for channel 1 rated by frequency of channel 3
;Bit 3: $08: (CH4 + 3), connection of dividers 4+3 to obtain 16-bit accuracy
;Bit 4: $10: (CH2 + 1), connection of dividers 2+1 to obtain 16-bit accuracy
;Bit 5: $20: (CH3 1.79), set channel 3 frequency &quot;0&quot; is 64 kHz. &quot;1&quot; is 1.79 MHz NTSC or 1.77 MHz PAL
;Bit 6: $40: (CH1 1.79), set channel 1 frequency &quot;0&quot; is 64 kHz. &quot;1&quot; is 1.79 MHz NTSC or 1.77 MHz PAL
;Bit 7: $80: (POLY 9), switch shift register &quot;0&quot; - 17-bit, &quot;1&quot; – 9-bit

All frequency dividers (AUDF) can be driven at the same time by 64 kHz or 15 kHz rate.

Frequency dividers 1 and 3 can be alternately driven by CPU clock (1.79 MHz NTSC, 1.77 MHz PAL).
Frequency dividers 2 and 4 can be alternately driven by output of dividers 1 and 3.
In this way, POKEY makes possible connecting of 8-bit channels to create sound with 16-bit accuracy.

Possible channel configurations:
* four 8-bit channels
* two 8-bit channels and one 16-bit channel
* two 16-bit channels

==Potentiometers==
POKEY has eight analog to digital converter ports most commonly used for potentiometers, also known as Paddle Controllers. The analog inputs are also used for the Touch Tablet controller, and the 12-button, video game Keyboard Controllers. Each input has a drop transistor, which can be set on or off from software. The timers can also be used to support a light pen, by connecting a photodiode to the drop transistor, which captures the timer when the electron beam in the television passes by the pen. The vertical position of the pen had to be read separately.

===POT0 $D200 Read===
SHADOW: PADDL0 $0270

Paddle Controller 0 Input

===POT6 $D206 Read===
SHADOW: PADDL6 $0276

Paddle Controller 6 Input

===POT7 $D207 Read===
SHADOW: PADDL7 $0277

Paddle Controller 7 Input

Each input has 8-bit timer, counting time when each TV line is being displayed. This had the added advantage of allowing the value read out to be fed directly into screen coordinates of objects being driven by the paddles. The Atari Paddle values range from 0 to 228, though the maximum possible is 244. The Paddle controller reads 0 when turned to its maximum clockwise position, and returns increasing values as it is turned counter-clockwise ending at its maximum value.

The Paddle reading process begins by writing to POTGO which resets the POT* values to 0, the ALLPOT value to $FF, and discharges the potentiometer read capacitors. The POT* values increment as they are being scanned until reaching the resistance value of the potentiometer. When the Paddle reading is complete the corresponding bit in ALLPOT is reset to 0.

The Paddle scanning process can take the majority of a video frame to complete. The Atari Operating System takes care of Paddle reading automatically. The Paddles are read and paddle scanning initiated during the stage 2 vertical blank. Paddle values are copied to shadow registers. (Note that Paddle triggers are actually joystick direction input read from PIA.)

A faster mode of scanning the Paddles is possible by setting a bit in SKCTL. The reading sequence completes in only a couple scan lines, but the value is less accurate.

===ALLPOT $D208 Read===
Potentiometer Scanning Status

Each bit corresponds to one potentiometer input (the POT* registers). When paddle scanning is started by writing to POTGO each paddle&#x27;s bit in ALLPOT is set to 1. When a paddle&#x27;s scan is complete the corresponding bit in ALLPOT is reset to 0 indicating the value in the associated POT* register is now valid to read.

===POTGO $D20B Write===
Start Potentiometer Scan

Writing to POTGO initiates the potentiometer (Paddle) scanning process. This resets the POT* values to 0, the ALLPOT value to $FF, and discharges the potentiometer read capacitors. As each potentiometer scan completes the bit corresponding to the potentiometer in ALLPOT is cleared indicating the value of the associated POT* register is valid for reading.

==Serial input output port==
Contains:
* serial input line
* serial output line
* serial clock output line
* two-way serial clock data line
* registers SKREST, SEROUT, SERIN, SKCTL, SKSTAT

POKEY is a sort of UART. Usually one of the doubled audio channels is used as baud rate generator. The standard baud rate is 19.2 kbit/s, the maximum possible baud rate is 127 kbit/s. A byte put into the SEROUT register is automatically sent over the serial bus. The data frame contains 10 bits: 1 start bit, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit. The voltage levels are 0 V (logical 0) and +4 V (logical 1). It is possible to connect the Atari serial port with an RS-232 port by means of a simple voltage converter.

Each input/output operation causes POKEY&#x27;s internal shift registers to change value, so when programming for POKEY, it is necessary to re-initialise some values after each operation is carried out.

===SKREST $D20A Write===
Reset Serial Port Status (SKSTAT).

A write to this register will reset bits 5 through 7 of SKSTAT which are latches to 1. The latches flag keyboard overrun, Serial data input overrun, and Serial data input frame error.

===SEROUT $D20D Write===
Serial port data output byte.

This is a parallel &quot;holding&quot; register for the eight bit (one byte) value that will be transferred to the serial shift register for output one bit at a time. When the port is ready to accept data for output a Serial Data Out interrupt informs the Operating System that it can write a byte to this output register.

===SERIN $D20D Read===
Serial port data input byte.

Like SEROUT, also a parallel &quot;holding&quot; register. This holds the eight bit (one byte) value assembled by the serial shift register reading the data input one bit at a time. When a full byte is read a Serial Data In interrupt occurs informing the Operating System that it can read the byte from this register.

===SKCTL $D20F Write===
Serial Port Control

Bit 0: Enable &quot;debounce&quot; scanning which is intended to eliminate noise or jitter from mechanical switches. A value of 1 enables POKEY to use an internal comparison register while scanning keys. A key must be detected in two simultaneous scans before it is identified as pressed, and it must be seen released for two consecutive scans to be considered released. This should be enabled to maintain normal keyboard handling with the Operating System.

Bit 1: Set to 1 to enable keyboard scanning. This should be enabled to maintain normal keyboard handling with the Operating System.

Bit 2: Set to 1 to enable fast, though less accurate Potentiometer scanning. Fast Pot scanning increments the counter on every cycle and returns a usable result within two scan lines. The Operating System uses the slow Pot Scanning which increments the counter once every 114 cycles (scan line) taking a frame (1/60th second) to produce a result. The OS reads the Pot values during its Vertical Blank Interrupt (VBI) and copies the result to the potentiometer Shadow registers in RAM. It then resets POTGO for the next read during the next VBI.

Bit 3: Enable Serial port two-tone mode. When enabled, 1 and 0 bits output to the SIO bus are replaced by tones set by timers 1 and 2. This is ordinarily used for writing analog tones representing digital data to cassette tape.

Bit 4-6: Clock Timing Control for serial port operation. Bit values described below:

Bit 7: Forces a known 0 output, so that timer 2 can reset timer 1 in two-tone serial output mode.

===SKSTAT $D20F Read===
Serial Port Status

===KBCODE $D209 Read===
SHADOW: CH $02FC

Keyboard Code

==Eight IRQ interrupts==
;BREAK: Break (BREAK key interrupt)
;K: Keyboard (keyboard interrupt)
;SIR: if Serial Input Ready (read interrupt from serial rail)
;ODN: if Output Data Needed (write interrupt from serial rail)
;XD: if eXmitend Data (serial transmission end interrupt)
;T1: Timer 1, timer 1 interrupt
;T2: Timer 2, timer 2 interrupt
;T4: Timer 4, timer 4 interrupt
Interrupts can be set on or off from software by register IRQEN.
IRQSTAT register contains interrupts status.

==Keyboard==
Six key register of actually pushed keys (K0 K5), which contains values from 00 to 3F. Contains 2 control values. One of them acts as decoder of all 6 values. Second control values is used to decode special key values — CTRL, SHIFT and BREAK.

<text>The Skeireins (; ) is the second-longest known surviving text in the Gothic language, after Ulfilas&#x27; version of the Bible. It consists of eight fragments of a commentary on the Gospel of John which is commonly held to have originally extended over seventy-eight parchment leaves. It owes its title to the 19th-century German scholar Hans Ferdinand Massmann, who was the first to issue a comprehensive and correct edition of it: &quot;Skeireins&quot; means &quot;explanation&quot; in Gothic. The manuscript containing the Skeireins text is a palimpsest.

Currently it is housed at the Vatican Library (Vat. lat. 5750) in Rome.

There are conflicting views on whether the &quot;Skeireins&quot; was written directly in Gothic by a native speaker or whether it was a translation from a Greek original. Schäferdiek (1981) observes striking similarities between the Gothic of the &quot;Skeireins&quot; and the Greek of Theodore of Heraclea&#x27;s commentary on the Gospel of John.

<doc id="466502" wikidata="Q35690" url="?curid=466502" title="I Am a Cat">
<text>is a satirical novel written in 1905–1906 by Natsume Sōseki about Japanese society during the Meiji period (1868–1912), particularly the uneasy mix of Western culture and Japanese traditions.

Sōseki&#x27;s title, &quot;Wagahai wa Neko de Aru&quot;, uses a very high-register phrasing more appropriate to a nobleman, conveying grandiloquence and self-importance. This is somewhat ironic, since the speaker, an anthropomorphized domestic cat, is a regular house cat of a teacher, and not of a high-ranking noble as the manner of speech suggests, an example of Sōseki&#x27;s love for droll writing.

The book was first published in ten installments in the literary journal &quot;Hototogisu&quot;. At first, Sōseki intended only to write the short story that constitutes the first chapter of &quot;I Am a Cat&quot;. However, Takahama Kyoshi, one of the editors of &quot;Hototogisu&quot;, persuaded Sōseki to serialize the work, which evolved stylistically as the installments progressed. Nearly all the chapters can stand alone as discrete works.

==Plot summary==
In &quot;I Am a Cat&quot;, a supercilious, feline narrator describes the lives of an assortment of middle-class Japanese people: Mr. (&quot;sneeze&quot; is misspelled on purpose, but literally translated from , in the original Japanese) and family (the cat&#x27;s owners), Sneaze&#x27;s garrulous and irritating friend , and the young scholar with his will-he-won&#x27;t-he courtship of the businessman&#x27;s spoiled daughter, .

==Cultural impact==
&quot;I Am a Cat&quot; is a frequent assignment to Japanese schoolchildren, such that the plot and style remain well-known long after publication. One effect was that the narrator&#x27;s manner of speech, which was archaic even at the time of writing, became largely associated with the cat and the book. The narrator&#x27;s preferred personal pronoun, , is rarely-to-never used in real life in Japan, but survives in fiction thanks to the book, generally for arrogant and pompous anthropomorphized animals. For example, Bowser, the turtle-king enemy in many &quot;Mario&quot; video games, uses , as does Morgana, a cat character in &quot;Persona 5&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The novel was first adapted into a film released in 1936. The film&#x27;s setting was moved to the end of WWI and the ending was changed to be less nihilistic. Later, prolific screenwriter Toshio Yasumi adapted the novel into a screenplay, and a second film was directed by Kon Ichikawa. It premiered in Japanese cinemas in 1975. An anime television special adaptation aired in 1982. It was also adapted into a manga by Chiroru Kobato in 2010 and translated into English by Zack Davisson.

<text>Castlecrag is a suburb on the lower North Shore of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 8 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Willoughby.

Castlecrag is a suburb of historical significance that is bounded to the north, east and south by Middle Harbour and to the west by Eastern Valley Way. Castlecrag shares its postcode, 2068, with the surrounding suburbs of Willoughby, Middle Cove and North Willoughby.

==History==
Castlecrag was originally planned by the husband and wife team, Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin who named the suburb after a towering crag of rock overlooking Middle Harbour, known locally as Edinburgh Castle. The Griffins came to Castlecrag in 1925 after tiring of the politics surrounding implementation of their designs for Australia&#x27;s capital city, Canberra.

Many early homes in Castlecrag were built using natural stone to blend into the environment, a common practice in architecture of the Arts and Crafts Movement, which was concerned with creating &quot;the human touch&quot; as distinct from mass production. Other homes of this period were built with bricks using Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s patented Knitlock system. Historically, Castlecrag was noted in the early 20th century as an experiment in communal and community planning and living.

&quot;Castle Crag&quot; Post Office opened on 1 September 1937 and was renamed &quot;Castlecrag&quot; in 1941.

The streets in the southern, older portion of the suburb were named after parts of a castle: The Barbette, The Barbican, The Barricade, The Bartizan, The Bastion, The Battlement, The Bulwark, The Citadel, The High Tor, The Outpost, The Palisade, The Parapet, The Postern, The Rampart, The Redoubt, The Scarp, The Tor Walk and Sortie Port. There are also Tower, Casement, and Turrett Reserves, and the main street through the centre is Edinburgh Road.

More recently the residents of the suburb have been noted for their opposition to the Warringah Freeway (Warringah Expressway), which was originally planned to link the Sydney Harbour Bridge with the Northern Beaches, but today terminates just south of Castlecrag in Naremburn.

===The Griffins&#x27; vision===

In 1921, Walter Burley Griffin (architect and landscape architect) and Marion Mahony Griffin (architect and artist) began designing Castlecrag a model residential suburb that was sympathetic to the Australian natural environment. Upon arriving in Australia in 1913, Walter Burley Griffin was struck by the natural beauty of the Sydney Harbour, and at the first Australian town planning conference; he emphasised that best planning practice should respect the natural character of the site&#x27;s landscape. Griffin formed the Greater Sydney Development Association (GSDA) together with several investors (Griffin holding more than 50% of the voting rights). This company purchased and developed Castlecrag with Griffin as managing director/lead planner. Griffin&#x27;s design for Castlecrag was based on careful planning, respectful of the particular site, and he was dismayed by the layout of Sydney&#x27;s suburbs, which he considered to be unimaginative (grid plan) and unsympathetic towards the environment. Both Griffin and Mahony Griffin firmly believed that development should not lead to the destruction of natural features. This concept was original for the time and is considered to have been influenced by the Garden City movement.

Also at the heart of the Griffins&#x27; vision for Castlecrag was establishing a sense of community and focusing on its needs. The pair believed this could be achieved by encouraging social interaction, providing opportunities for people to contribute to their community and planning many parks and recreational spaces. The Griffins lived in Castlecrag from 1925, and actively participated in the community, planting native trees, landscaping and developing a natural amphitheatre. Marion Mahony Griffin had a passionate interest in the arts and helped instigate the creation of the Haven Scenic Amphitheatre where plays and festivals were held. Community spirit was also fostered through the establishment of groups such as music groups and the Neighbourhood Circle, and through the willingness of residents to help one another in the building of houses.

The Haven Amphitheatre is undergoing redevelopment by Willoughby City Council. This project while underway has been subject to countless delays and controversy. It is envisaged that the new Haven Amphitheatre Stage will significantly enhance the ability of the site to operate again as a performance venue. The famous Haven Christmas Carols have not been held in recent years. Many stakeholders are involved in the process for the DA approval and eventual rebuild, such as, The Haven Amphitheatre Committee, Willoughby City Council, The Castlecrag Progress Association, The Walter Burley Griffin Society and Friends of the Haven.

===Planning considerations===

The roads of Castlecrag were planned to suit the topography of the area; following the natural contours of the land. This contrasted with the grid plan, which was characteristic of many suburbs in Sydney at the time; reflecting the Griffins&#x27; belief that the built environment should respect the natural environment. The trees that bordered the roads in Castlecrag were not removed and the roads were barely visible from above. Furthermore, the layout of the streets also provided residents with views of the landscape.

The architects designed reserves that were linked together by a network of walkways, providing the community with ample space for recreation and bushwalking whilst retaining the bushland backdrop. The roads, paths and reserves were diligently planned for the convenience and pleasure of the residents and to retain views. The Griffin&#x27;s plan involved 20% of the land at Castlecrag being set aside for parkland - considerably more than the amount dictated by Council regulations, 2%.

Before the development of Castlecrag, the peninsula was being stripped of vegetation for firewood, soil and other needs. The Griffins promoted respect for the natural environment by planting and protecting native trees in both public reserves and gardens and by establishing covenants on the land. The covenants placed restrictions on land uses and construction, which enabled the character of the area to be protected. The covenants prevented the creation of buildings that were out of place, impeded views or were too dominant. The covenants also required residents to pay a levy that supported the ongoing maintenance of reserves, tree planting and other activities designed to safeguard the natural environment. Today, the national, state and local governments as well as heritage organisations acknowledge the importance of protecting the built and natural environment at Castlecrag and have established controls over its management and development.

===Architecture===
During Castlecrag&#x27;s early years, houses were either designed by Griffin and Mahony Griffin (fifteen were built) or approved by them. The houses were characterised by concrete block and stone found at the site, material which matched the natural surroundings (three houses were built using Knitlock only). The use of these materials facilitated the quick and affordable construction of the houses. The Griffins&#x27; designs boasted innovations such as the kitchens&#x27; pass-through pantries and twin sinks, the close-to ground floor levels and the picture window.

Some aspects of the Griffins&#x27; houses in Castlecrag were unusual and unconventional such as the treatment of stonework, the window details and the flat roofs. Flat roofs were favoured over pitched roofs as they prevented the obstruction of views, provided vantage points where one could experience a view of the landscape and allowed for a rooftop garden. Another atypical feature of the Griffin/Mahony Griffin houses was the unusual location of the kitchens and bathrooms. These rooms were situated at the front of the house even though convention was to have these rooms at the back of the house. The houses were designed in such a way so that the living rooms located at the rear faced a view or park on the inner side of the allotment. Their houses did not have front fences and built structures were minimal within ten metres of each property. This, in addition to many of the houses being single story and boasting colours of the natural surroundings exemplifies the Griffins&#x27; objective which did not involve establishing imposing and artificial built structures, but rather to have the buildings blend in with the environment; retaining the bush setting. Thus, the Griffins&#x27; designs were remarkably different from the uniform designs at the time - houses with red, pitched roofs - which Griffin detested.

There has since been development in Castlecrag that has not respected the Griffin ideals. However, the Willoughby City Council is aware of the importance of Castlecrag and has imposed controls over development in the area. The purpose of the controls is to preserve the character of Castlecrag, encouraging the construction of buildings, which respect the original houses designed by Griffin and Mahony Griffin, and the natural landscape.

== Transport ==
Castlecrag is served by the 203 and 275 bus route from North Sydney and Chatswood. It is operated by Busways.

<doc id="466507" wikidata="Q5326245" url="?curid=466507" title="Earl of Darnley">
<text>Earl of Darnley is a hereditary title that has been created three times, twice in the Peerage of Scotland and once in the Peerage of Ireland.

The first creation in the Scots Peerage came in 1580 in favour of Esme Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox, who was created Duke of Lennox at the same time. The title of Lord Darnley had previously been held by John Stewart, head of the house of Stewart of Darnley and first Earl of Lennox (1488). The second creation in the Peerage of Scotland came in 1675 in favour of Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond. He was made Duke of Lennox at the same time. For more information on this creation, see the Duke of Richmond.

The only creation in the Peerage of Ireland was in 1725 to John Bligh, 1st Earl of Darnley, descended from a prominent Devon family via a cadet branch which had settled in County Meath, Ireland; he was the son of the Rt Hon Thomas Bligh who was in turn the son of John Bligh, of Plymouth, a Commissioner of Customs and Excise despatched to Ireland in search of forfeited estates, and in turn his father was William Bligh, a prosperous Plymouth merchant.

John Bligh, 1st Earl of Darnley, married Theodosia Hyde, 10th Baroness Clifton (of Leighton Bromswold), great-granddaughter of Lord George Stuart, younger son of Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox, also 3rd Earl of Darnley (see the Baron Clifton of Leighton Bromswold and the Duke of Lennox for earlier history of these titles). He represented Athboy in the Irish House of Commons from 1709 to 1721. In 1721 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Clifton of Rathmore, in the County of Meath. In 1723 the Darnley title held by his wife&#x27;s ancestors (which had become extinct on the death of Charles Stewart, 6th Duke of Lennox and 6th Earl of Darnley in 1672) was revived when he was created Viscount Darnley, of Athboy in the County of Meath, in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1725 Bligh was further honoured when he was advanced as Earl of Darnley, in the County of Meath, also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He had already succeeded his mother in 1722 as eleventh Baron Clifton of Leighton Bromswold in the Peerage of England. Lord Darnley served as a Lord of the Bedchamber to Frederick, Prince of Wales, but died unmarried in 1747, aged 31.

He was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl. He had earlier represented Athboy in the Irish House of Commons and Maidstone in the British House of Commons. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the fourth Earl. In 1828 he presented a claim as heir-general to the dukedom of Lennox, challenged by the Countess Nugent, but the House of Lords did not come to any decision on the matter. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the fifth Earl. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Canterbury and served as Lord Lieutenant of County Meath. On the death of his grandson, the seventh Earl (who had succeeded his father in 1896), the barony of Clifford of Leighton Bromswold separated from the Irish titles when it devolved upon the late Earl&#x27;s daughter and only child, the ten-month-old Lady Elizabeth Bligh, who became the seventeenth holder of the barony by writ of summons. Lord Darnley was succeeded in the Irish titles by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. A talented and successful cricketer who captained MCC, he sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1905 to 1927. On his death the titles passed to his only son, the ninth Earl. In 1937 he succeeded his first cousin The Lady Clifton (who died unmarried) in her ancient English barony by writ of summons being her heir-general, as eighteenth Baron Clifton of Leighton Bromswold. He was by his only son from his third marriage with &quot;Rosemary, Dowager Countess of Darnley&quot; (&quot;née&quot; Potter, died 2005), the eleventh Earl, who succeeded his half-brother (the only son from the first marriage of the ninth Earl), in 1980. As of 2017 the title is held by his only son, the twelfth earl, who succeeded his father in that year.

Several other members of the Bligh family have also attained distinction. Thomas Bligh (1654–1710), father of the first Earl, represented County Meath as its MP in the Irish Parliament and was sworn of the Irish Privy Council. Thomas Bligh, younger brother of the first Earl, was a general in the British Army and represented Athboy in the Irish House of Commons for sixty years. The Very Reverend Robert Bligh (c. 1704–1778), another brother of the first Earl, was an Anglican clergyman who became Dean of Elphin. General the Hon. Edward Bligh (1769–1840), second son of the third Earl, was a general in the British Army. The Hon. William Bligh (1775–1845), third son of the third Earl, was a colonel in the Army. The Hon. Sir John Bligh (1798–1872), fourth son of the fourth Earl, was a diplomat and served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Hanover. Susan Bligh, Countess of Darnley, the eleventh Earl&#x27;s wife was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire in 2008.

The family seat is Netherwood Manor at Thornbury, Herefordshire, near Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire. The former was Cobham Hall, near Gravesend, Kent, from the 18th century until 1957, and the family still retains some property in the village.

===John Bligh, 1st Earl of Darnley (1687–1728)===
John Bligh, 1st Earl of Darnley (1687–1728), who married, in 1713, Lady Theodosia Hyde. He was descended from a prominent Devon family via a cadet branch which had settled in County Meath, Ireland. Following his marriage in 1713 to Theodosia Hyde, 10th Baroness Clifton (of Leighton Bromswold), a descendant of Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox, also 3rd Earl of Darnley, he was in 1725 created Earl of Darnley (a reference to his ancestors the Stewarts of Darnley of Cobham) in the Peerage of Ireland. He was the son of Thomas Bligh, the son of John Bligh of Plymouth (son of William Bligh, a prosperous Plymouth merchant), a Commissioner of Customs and Excise despatched to Ireland in search of forfeited estates. He represented Athboy in the Irish House of Commons from 1709 to 1721. In 1721 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Clifton of Rathmore, in the County of Meath. In 1723 the Darnley title held by his wife&#x27;s ancestors (which had become extinct on the death of Charles Stewart, 6th Duke of Lennox and 6th Earl of Darnley in 1672) was revived when he was created Viscount Darnley, of Athboy in the County of Meath, in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1725 Bligh was further honoured when he was advanced as Earl of Darnley, in the County of Meath, also in the Peerage of Ireland. He died in 1728 and was buried with his wife in the &quot;Hyde Vault&quot; in Westminster Abbey, in the north ambulatory, near the steps up to Henry VII&#x27;s chapel.

===John Bligh, 3rd Earl of Darnley (1719–1781)===

John Bligh, 3rd Earl of Darnley (1719–1781); third son of the 1st Earl. He served as a Member of Parliament for Maidstone and in the Irish House of Commons for Athboy. He carried out various building works at Cobham, between 1768 and 1770 he added an extra floor to the west front, to the design of Sir William Chambers. Between 1771 and 1773 he added a 2-storey corridor to the north side of the central block and began building the east court (or &quot;kitchen court&quot;) to match the two Tudor wings. He redecorated several rooms in the classical style. By his will he left instructions for the building of the Darnley Mausoluem within the deer park, to house the embalmed corpses of his descendants, the &quot;Hyde Vault&quot; in Westminster Abbey (in the north ambulatory, near the steps leading up to Henry VII&#x27;s Lady Chapel) having become full. He required it to be in the form of a square building with a &quot;prominent pyramid&quot; and surrounded by a dry moat, possibly having been inspired by the Pyramid of Cestius (12 BC) in Rome which he would have seen on his grand tour during his youth. Although the work was duly completed in 1786, to the design of the architect James Wyatt, it never received the approval of the local Bishop of Rochester to become a consecrated building and thus was never used for its intended purpose.

From 1991 he served as vice-chairman of the governors of Cobham Hall School, where his sister Lady Harriet was educated. He moved to Herefordshire with his family in October 1984 to farm the Netherwood Estate.

<doc id="466510" wikidata="Q4835082" url="?curid=466510" title="Door (bulletin board system)">
<text>In a bulletin board system (BBS), a door is an interface between the BBS software and an external application. The term is also used to refer to the external application, a computer program that runs outside of the main bulletin board program. Sometimes called &quot;external programs&quot;, doors are the most common way to add games, utilities, and other extensions to BBSes. Because BBSes typically depended on the telephone system, BBSes and door programs tended to be local in nature, unlike modern Internet games and applications.

From the 1990s on, most BBS software had the capability to &quot;drop to&quot; doors. Several standards were developed for passing connection and user information to doors; this was usually done with &quot;dropfiles&quot;, small binary or text files dropped into known locations in the BBS&#x27;s file system. Most doors were responsible for operating the serial port or other communications device directly until returning control to the BBS. Later development of FOSSIL drivers have allowed both BBSes and their doors to communicate without being responsible for direct operation of the communications hardware.

== Door games ==

A major use of doors is for &quot;door games&quot;: computer games played on the BBS. These games included strategy games such as &quot;TradeWars 2002&quot;, &quot;Food Fight!&quot;, &quot;Solar Realms Elite&quot;, &quot;Space Dynasty&quot;, Usurper, and &quot;Barren Realms Elite&quot;. There were also role-playing games (RPG), often derived from earlier email-based games—examples include Seth Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Legend of the Red Dragon&quot;, popular dystopian RPG: &quot;Operation: Overkill,&quot; and &quot;Mutants!&quot;. BBSes often published high scores, encouraging players to beat others.

InterBBS leagues allowed users of different BBSes to compete against each other in the same game. A modern version of this known as BBSlink exists allowing sysops to offer door games on their BBS which are hosted on a remote server, thereby increasing the user base of the game.

== Other applications ==

While many of the most popular and memorable BBS doors have been games, numerous doors had non-entertainment applications such as user polls or the time bank, permitting users to time-shift their rationed BBS use. Frequently they act as a front-end to themed databases on subject such as astrology, numerology and fortune-telling, recipes, weather prediction, personal ads (sometimes with additional match-making functionality), classified ads and &quot;for sale&quot; listings (sometimes permitting auctions), BBS lists, and parting comments from the most recent BBS callers.

<text>Earl of Donoughmore is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It is associated with the Hely-Hutchinson family. Paternally of Gaelic Irish descent with the original name of &quot;Ó hÉalaighthe&quot;, their ancestors had long lived in the County Cork area as allies of the Mac Cárthaigh clan; they lost out during the times of Oliver Cromwell. One branch of the family converted to the Anglican Church and after inheriting territories through his mother and adding &quot;Hutchinson&quot; to Hely, became the Earl of Donoughmore.

==History==
The title Earl of Donoughmore was created in 1800 for Richard Hely-Hutchinson, 1st Viscount Donoughmore, with remainder to the heirs male of his mother. He was a General in the British Army and sat in the House of Lords as one of the 28 original Irish representative peers from 1800 to 1825. Hely-Hutchinson had already been created Viscount Donoughmore, of Knocklofty in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of Ireland in 1797, and was made Viscount Hutchinson, of Knocklofty in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, in 1821. These titles were also created with remainder to the heirs male of his mother. Lord Donoughmore was the eldest son of the Irish statesman and lawyer John Hely-Hutchinson, who married Christiana, daughter of Abraham Nixon (or Nickson) and niece and heiress of Richard Hutchinson of Knocklofty in County Tipperary, whose surname she and her husband adopted. In 1783 Christiana was raised to the Peerage of Ireland in honour of her husband as Baroness Donoughmore, of Knocklofty in the County of Tipperary.
The first Earl was succeeded according to the special remainder (and normally in the barony of Donoughmore) by his younger brother, the second Earl. He was also a General in the British Army. In 1801 he was created Baron Hutchinson, of Alexandria and Knocklofty in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. Lord Donoughmore also served as Lord-Lieutenant of County Tipperary from 1831 to 1832. On his death in 1832 the barony of 1801 became extinct while he was succeeded in the other titles by his nephew, the third Earl. He was the son of the Honourable Francis Hely-Hutchinson, third son of the first Baroness Donoughmore and John Hely-Hutchinson. He briefly represented Tipperary in the House of Commons and served as Lord-Lieutenant of County Tipperary. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He was a Conservative politician and served in the Earl of Derby&#x27;s second administration as Paymaster General and President of the Board of Trade. His grandson, the fifth Earl, was also a Conservative politician and held office as Under-Secretary of State for War from 1903 to 1904 under Arthur Balfour. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Earl, a noted Irish Freemason. His son, the seventh Earl, sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Peterborough from 1943 to 1945. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s eldest son, the eighth Earl, who succeeded in 1981.

Another member of the Hely-Hutchinson family was the Honourable Christopher Hely-Hutchinson (1767–1826), fifth son of Baroness Donoughmore and John Hely-Hutchison. He represented Cork City in the House of Commons. The Honourable Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, younger son of the fourth Earl, was the last Governor of the Cape Colony. The Honourable Tim Hely Hutchinson, second son of the eighth Earl, is a publisher.

The family seat now is The Manor House, near Bampton, Oxfordshire. The former family seat was Knocklofty House, near Clonmel, County Tipperary, in Ireland. The Knocklofty Estate was sold by the family in the 1970s.

The heir apparent to the earldom uses the invented courtesy title &quot;Viscount Suirdale&quot; (pronounced &quot;Shure-dale&quot;). This derives from the fact that the territorial designation of the Irish viscountcy of Donoughmore was erroneously thought to be &quot;of Suirdale&quot;.

<text>Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl (usually referred to as Earl of Dunraven) was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created on 5 February 1822 for Valentine Quin, 1st Viscount Mount-Earl. Quin had already been created a Baronet, of Adare in County Limerick, in the Baronetage of Ireland, in 1781, Baron Adare, of Adare in the County of Limerick, on 31 July 1800, and Viscount Mount-Earl on 3 February 1816. He was made Viscount Adare in 1822 at the same time as he was given the earldom. The latter peerage titles were also in the Peerage of Ireland. 

The title was in honour of the first earl&#x27;s daughter-in-law, the heiress Caroline Wyndham of Dunraven Castle, who had married his eldest son Windham Henry Quin in 1810.

His son, the second Earl, represented County Limerick in the House of Commons from 1806 to 1820 and also sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1839 until his death in 1850. In 1815 the second Earl had assumed by Royal licence his wife&#x27;s maiden surname of Wyndham in addition to that of Quin. His eldest son, the third Earl, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Glamorganshire from 1836 to 1850 and also served as Lord Lieutenant of County Limerick from 1864 to 1871. In 1866, Dunraven was given the additional title of Baron Kenry, of Kenry in the County Limerick, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. 

He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl, who served in the Conservative government of Lord Salisbury as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1885 to 1886. A member of the Irish Unionist Party, he was also Lord Lieutenant of County Limerick from 1894 to 1926. When the Chief Secretary for Ireland, George Wyndham, called a Land Conference in 1902, Lord Dunraven was chairman representing the landlord side and together with William O&#x27;Brien played a decisive role in attaining agreement on the enactment of the Wyndham Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903 which enabled tenants to purchase lands from their landlords under favourable financial provisions. He was a Senator of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1926. He had no male heirs and on his death the barony of Kenry became extinct. The Fourth Earl published his memoir &quot;Past Times and Pastimes&quot; in 1922 (Hodder and Stoughton). He was succeeded in the other titles by his cousin, the fifth Earl. He had previously represented South Glamorganshire in Parliament as a Conservative from 1895 to 1906. The titles became extinct when the seventh Earl died on 25 March 2011 at his residence, Kilgobbin House.

The family seat until the seventh Earl&#x27;s death was Kilgobbin House, in Adare, Ireland. The former seat was the palatial Adare Manor in County Limerick. Adare Manor was sold by the Dunraven family in 1982 and is now a luxury hotel. The south Wales home of the Dunraven family, Dunraven House at Dunraven Bay, near Bridgend, no longer exists apart from the walled gardens and some floors and steps. Dunraven Castle, as it was often called, was demolished in 1963 after having been used as a guest house for some years. In the First and Second World Wars, the house served as a military hospital.

The Earl of Dunraven arrived at what would become Estes Park, Colorado in late December 1872, visited repeatedly, and decided to take over the valley for his own private hunting preserve. His land grab did not work, but he controlled 6,000 acres before he changed tactics and opened the area&#x27;s first resort, the Estes Park Hotel, which was destroyed by fire in 1911.

<text>Somerset House is a large building complex situated on the south side of the Strand in central London, overlooking the River Thames, just east of Waterloo Bridge. The Georgian era quadrangle was built on the site of a Tudor palace (&quot;Old Somerset House&quot;) originally belonging to the Duke of Somerset in 1547. The present Somerset House was designed by Sir William Chambers, begun in 1776, and was further extended with Victorian era outer wings to the east and west in 1831 and 1856 respectively. The site of Somerset House stood directly on the River Thames until the Victoria Embankment was built in the late 1860s.

The great Georgian era structure was built to be a grand public building housing various government and public-benefit society offices. Its present tenants are a mixture of various organisations, generally centred around the arts and education.

==Old Somerset House==
===16th century===
In the 16th century, the Strand, the north bank of the Thames between the City of London and the Palace of Westminster, was a favoured site for the mansions of bishops and aristocrats, who could commute from their own landing stages upriver to the court or downriver to the City and beyond. In 1539, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (died 1552), obtained a grant of land at &quot;Chester Place, outside Temple Bar, London&quot; from his brother-in-law King Henry VIII. When his nephew the young King Edward VI came to the throne in 1547, Seymour became Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector. In about 1549 he pulled down an old Inn of Chancery and other houses that stood on the site, and began to build himself a palatial residence, making liberal use of other nearby buildings, including some of the chantry chapels and cloisters at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, which were demolished partly at his behest as part of the ongoing dissolution of the monasteries. It was a two-storey house built around a quadrangle, with a gateway rising to three storeys, and was one of the earliest examples of Renaissance architecture in England. It is not known who designed the building.

Before it was finished, however, the Duke of Somerset was overthrown, attainted by Parliament and in 1552 was executed on Tower Hill. Somerset Place, as the building was referred to, then came into the possession of the Crown. The duke&#x27;s royal nephew&#x27;s half-sister, the future Queen Elizabeth I, lived there during the reign of her half-sister Queen Mary I (1553–58). The process of completion and improvement was slow and costly. As late as 1598 John Stow refers to it as &quot;yet unfinished&quot;.

===17th and 18th centuries===

In the summer of 1604, Somerset House was the location for the negotiations, known as the Somerset House Conference that culminated in the Treaty of London and concluded the nineteen-year Anglo-Spanish War. The treaty was signed on 28 August (New Style), at Whitehall Palace, by the Constable of Castile who was lodged at Somerset House. The conference was the subject of an oil-on-canvas painting depicting the 11 representatives of the governments of England, Spain and the Spanish Netherlands, seated around a conference table, probably in Old Somerset House.

During the 17th century, the house was used as a residence by royal consorts. In the reign of King James I, the building was the London residence of his wife, Anne of Denmark, and was renamed Denmark House. She commissioned a number of expensive additions and improvements, some to designs by Inigo Jones. In 1609 Simon Basil and William Goodrowse made steps and terraces in the garden. Anne of Denmark built an orangery and employed a French gardener and hydraulic engineer Salomon de Caus. He built a fountain known as Mount Parnassus with a grotto carved with sea-shells and a black marble female figure representing the River Thames. The fountain was topped by a statue of Pegasus. A surviving cistern for the fountain in nearby Strand Lane was misidentified as a Roman bath.

The refurbished palace was the setting for elaborate entertainments at the wedding of Anne&#x27;s lady in waiting Jean Drummond on 3 February 1614, including a masque &quot;Hymen&#x27;s Triumph&quot; written by Samuel Daniel. On 22 May 1614, Christian IV of Denmark paid a surprise visit to his sister. In 1619, King James granted the palace to Prince Charles. Frances Coke, Viscountess Purbeck was appointed keeper of Denmark House, and Mary Villiers, Countess of Buckingham frequently stayed there.

After the death of King James in April 1625, his body was brought from Theobalds to lie in state at Denmark House. The state rooms were hung with black cloth. At this period there was no chapel at Denmark House, and so the Great Hall was adapted, and the body moved there before the funeral at Westminster Abbey.

Between 1630 and 1635 Inigo Jones built a chapel where Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of King Charles I, could exercise her Roman Catholic religion. This was in the care of the Capuchin Order and was on a site to the southwest of the Great Court. A small cemetery was attached and some of the tombstones are still to be seen built into one of the walls of a passage under the present quadrangle.

Royal occupation of Somerset House was interrupted by the Civil War, and in 1649 Parliament tried to sell it. They failed to find a buyer, although a sale of the contents (most notably 1,570 paintings owned by Charles I) realised the very considerable sum (for that time) of £118,000. Use was still found for it however. Part of it served as an army headquarters, with General Fairfax (the Parliamentarians&#x27; commander-in-chief) being given official quarters there; lodgings were also provided for certain other Parliamentarian notables. It was in Somerset House that Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s body lay in state after his death in 1658. 

Two years later, with the Restoration, Queen Henrietta Maria returned and in 1661 began a considerable programme of rebuilding, the main feature of which was a magnificent new river front, again to the design of the late Inigo Jones, who had died at Somerset House in 1652. However she returned to France in 1665 before it was finished. It was then used as an occasional residence by Catherine of Braganza, wife of King Charles II. During her time it received a certain notoriety as being, in the popular mind, a hot-bed of Catholic conspiracy. Titus Oates made full use of this prejudice in the fabricated details of the Popish Plot and it was alleged that Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, whose murder was one of the great mysteries of the age, had been killed in Somerset House before his body had been smuggled out and thrown into a ditch below Primrose Hill.

Somerset House was refurbished by Sir Christopher Wren in 1685. After the Glorious Revolution in 1688, Somerset House entered on a long period of decline, being used (after Queen Catherine left England in 1692) for grace and favour residences. In the conditions of the time this meant almost inevitably that little money could be found for its upkeep, and a slow process of decay crept in. During the 18th century, however, the building ceased its royal associations. Though the view from its terraced riverfront garden, open to the public, was painted twice on his London visit by Canaletto (looking up- and downriver), it was used for storage, as a residence for visiting overseas dignitaries and as a barracks for troops. Suffering from neglect, Old Somerset House began to be demolished in 1775. 

==Somerset House (Sir William Chambers, 1776)==

Since the middle of the 18th century there had been growing criticism that London had no great public buildings. Government departments and the learned societies were huddled away in small old buildings all over the city. Developing national pride found comparison with the capitals of continental Europe disquieting. Edmund Burke was the leading proponent of the scheme for a &quot;national building&quot;, and in 1775 Parliament passed an act, the (15 Geo. 3. c. 33), for the purpose of, &quot;inter alia&quot;, &quot;erecting and establishing Offices in Somerset House, and for embanking Parts of the River Thames lying within the bounds of the Manor of Savoy&quot;. The list of public offices mentioned in the act comprised &quot;The Salt Office, The Stamp Office, The Tax Office, The Navy Office, The Navy Victualling Office, The Publick Lottery Office, The Hawkers and Pedlar Office, The Hackney Coach Office, The Surveyor General of the Crown Lands Office, The Auditors of the Imprest Office, The Pipe Office, The Office of the Duchy of Lancaster, The Office of the Duchy of Cornwall, The Office of Ordnance, The King&#x27;s Bargemaster&#x27;s House, The King&#x27;s Bargehouses&quot;.

Somerset House was still technically a royal palace and therefore Crown property, with most work being done by the King&#x27;s Master Mason, John Deval. The building had been placed in trust for the use of Queen Charlotte in the event that her husband King George III predeceased her. Therefore, the 1775 act annulled this arrangement and instead provided for another property, Buckingham House, to be vested in trust for the Queen on the same terms. (Provision was made for the King, who had privately purchased Buckingham House some years earlier, to be duly compensated). In due course, the King outlived the Queen and the property (later known as Buckingham Palace) reverted &quot;to the use of His Majesty, his heirs and successors&quot;. By virtue of the same act, Ely House in Holborn (which had itself been purchased just a few years earlier as a potential site for new public offices) was sold and the proceeds applied to the Somerset House project.

Initially a certain William Robinson, Secretary to the Board of Works, was commissioned to design and build the new Somerset House, but he died in 1775 shortly after being appointed. So Sir William Chambers, Comptroller of the King&#x27;s Works, (who had in any case been vying for the commission) was appointed in his stead, at a salary of £2,000 per year. He spent the last two decades of his life, beginning in 1775, in several phases of building at the present Somerset House. Thomas Telford, then a stonemason, but later an eminent civil engineer, was among those who worked on its construction. One of Chambers&#x27;s most famous pupils, Thomas Hardwick Jnr, helped build parts of the building during his period of training and later wrote a short biography of Chambers. The design influenced other great buildings: Charles Bulfinch&#x27;s Massachusetts State House, begun in 1795, has been described as a work &quot;frankly derivative&quot; of Somerset House.

===Design===

Chambers&#x27; own influences stemmed from Palladianism, the principles of which were applied throughout Somerset House, inside and outside, both in its large-scale conception and in its small-scale details. The footprint of the building was that of the old palace, ranging from its gateway block in the Strand across what was originally a gently sloping site down to the river. Chambers experimented with at least four different configurations of buildings and courtyards in drawing up his designs; his final version provided a single courtyard, by , flanked by a pair of terraces, the whole presenting a unified frontage to the river, wide. Around the courtyard, each block consisted of six storeys: cellar, basement, ground, principal, attic and garret. The public offices and learned societies which were accommodated around the courtyard varied greatly in size, but each occupied all six floors of its allotted area, the upper floors often providing living space for a secretary or other official. Large vaults for storing public documents were provided, extending under the entire northern section of the courtyard.

====Construction====

The North Wing, fronting the Strand, was the first part of the complex to be built; its design was based on Inigo Jones&#x27;s drawings for the riverfront of the former palace. By 1780 the North Wing was finished and occupied, and Chambers reported to Parliament that the rest of the quadrangle was complete up to a height of two storeys. Construction of the riverside wing followed; it was finished in 1786. At the time of construction, the Thames was not embanked and the river lapped the South Wing, where a great arch allowed boats and barges to penetrate to landing places within the building. Meanwhile, work continued on the East and West Wings, which began to be occupied from 1788; by 1790 the main quadrangle was complete.

It was originally envisaged that the main quadrangle would be flanked by two terraces of houses, one to the east and one to the west, providing accommodation for several of the Commissioners whose offices were based there. It is not certain at what pace the rest of the construction progressed, but it is clear that the outbreak of war with France in 1793 caused delays through lack of money. Chambers died in 1796, whereupon James Wyatt took over as architect. In the end, only the western terrace was built and by 1801 the building was deemed to be complete, at a cost of £462,323.

In 1815 Sir Robert Smirke was appointed as Attached Architect to Somerset House; in 1817 he added the Legacy Duty Office to the north-west corner of the quadrangle, its design in keeping with Chambers&#x27;s adjacent façade. Even as late as 1819, decorative work to the exterior of the North Wing was still being completed.

====Ornamentation====
In addition to applying a rich scheme of architectural decoration, Chambers enhanced the exterior of Somerset House with a multiplicity of sculptures and other visual embellishments. Giovanni Cipriani produced designs and the sculptors executing them included Joseph Wilton, Agostino Carlini, John Bacon, Joseph Nollekens, John Cheere and Giuseppe Ceracchi. Bacon oversaw production of the bronze group of statues (consisting of Neptune and George III) in the main courtyard, facing the main entrance from the Strand.

Inside, most of the offices were plain and business-like, but in the North Wing the formal rooms and public spaces of the learned societies were enriched with painted ceilings (by Cipriani, Benjamin West, Angelica Kauffman, J. F. Rigaud, Charles Catton and Joshua Reynolds), ornamental plasterwork (by Thomas Collins and Thomas Clerk) and casts of classical sculptures. John Papworth did the plasterwork in the great Royal Academy Room; many of the ceiling paintings were removed by the Royal Academy when they vacated their premises.

===Accommodation===
A key reason for rebuilding Somerset House was to provide accommodation for a diverse variety of learned societies, public offices and naval administrators. 

====A home for arts and learning====

The North Wing of Somerset House was initially fitted out to house the Royal Academy, the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries. The Royal Academy took up residence first, in 1779, followed by the other two institutions the following year. The Royal Academy occupied the western half of the wing and the Royal Society the eastern half; their main entrances faced each other across the central vestibule leading from the Strand to the courtyard, topped by busts (of Michelangelo and Isaac Newton respectively) which are still in place today. The Society of Antiquaries was also accommodated in the eastern half of the wing, though its premises were limited to a first-floor meeting room, a ground-floor library, an apartment in the attic and a kitchen in the basement.

The Geological Society was also accommodated in the Somerset House from 1828, as was the Royal Astronomical Society from 1834.

The annual Royal Academy Exhibition was held in Somerset House from 1780 onwards, until the academy moved out in 1837 (initially to rooms in the new National Gallery, then to Burlington House, Piccadilly). Its former accommodation was given over to a newly established Government School of Design (which was much later to become the Royal College of Art); it remained in the complex from 1837 until, in 1853, the Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths needed to expand its office space and the School relocated to Marlborough House.

In 1857, the Royal Society moved out of Somerset House, followed in 1874 by the Society of Antiquaries, the Geological Society and the Royal Astronomical Society; they were all provided with new purpose-built accommodation in Burlington House.

====The Navy Office====

In 1789 the Navy Board moved into grand riverside rooms in the western half of the newly completed South Wing. It was soon followed by its subsidiary Boards, the Victualling Commissioners and the Sick and Hurt Commissioners, which (along with the autonomous Navy Pay Office) occupied the West Wing; they had all hitherto been based in the City of London. Thus the various Navy offices occupied around a third of Chambers&#x27; completed building. In addition, the terrace to the west of the quadrangle provided dwelling-houses for the Comptroller of the Navy, the Secretary to the Board and three Commissioners of the Navy, along with the chairman, Secretary and two Commissioners of Victualling, with the Treasurer of the Navy allotted the &#x27;mansion&#x27; at the river end of the terrace (which included a coach house and stables for ten horses in the vaults under the terrace). As well as providing office space and accommodation, Somerset House was the place where examinations for promotion to the rank of lieutenant took place, sat by several hundred midshipmen each year. The Admiralty Museum (a precursor to the National Maritime Museum) was also accommodated there, in the central room above the south portico.

In 1832 the Navy Board and its subsidiaries were abolished and their departments placed under the direct oversight of the Admiralty. Their administrative staff remained in Somerset House, but communications with the Admiralty (based a mile away in Whitehall) were problematic as what became known as the &quot;civil departments&quot; of the Admiralty guarded their independence. In 1868, the Admiralty took the decision to move all their staff from Somerset House to Whitehall; this necessitated reconfiguring what had been a set of residences there pertaining to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty into office accommodation. Nevertheless, the move was completed by 1873, and the expanding Inland Revenue immediately took over the vacated space in Somerset House.

====Taxes, stamps and the Inland Revenue====

From the beginning of the new Somerset House there was a fiscal presence in the shape of the Stamp Office and the Tax Office, the former occupying the eastern part of the South Wing from 1789 and the latter occupying part of the East Wing. The Stamp Office had the task of applying an impressed duty stamp to various specific items to show that the required duty had been paid. For example, up until 1855 (when the relevant duty was abolished) every newspaper produced in the country had to be brought to Somerset House to be stamped. The Tax Office administered and collected various taxes, including income tax (first levied in 1799). Introduced as a means of raising revenue in wartime, it was collected during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars; though repealed in 1816, it was reintroduced in peacetime (in 1842) and has been collected ever since.

The Inland Revenue was created by a merger of the Stamp and Taxes Office and the Excise Office in 1849; in 1854 the Excise Office staff were moved from their old headquarters in the City of London into the newly built New Wing.

Somerset House continued in use by the Inland Revenue throughout the 20th century. In 2005, the Inland Revenue was merged with HM Customs and Excise; its successor HM Revenue &amp; Customs continued to occupy much of the building, although its executive and senior management moved to 100 Parliament Street shortly after the merger. Various divisions and directorates of HMRC continued to occupy the East Wing until 2009, the West Wing until 2011 and the New Wing until March 2013, by which time all staff had been relocated (with most moving across the street to the southwest wing of Bush House). This brought to an end a 224-year association of the revenue services with Somerset House.

====Somerset House Laboratory====
In 1842, the Excise Office had established a laboratory within its Broad Street headquarters for the prevention of the adulteration of tobacco products. It had started as basically a one-man operation by an employee of the Excise, George Phillips. After the Excise Office had been merged with the Office of Stamps and Taxes to form the Inland Revenue, the latter took over the laboratory; by 1858 it was reestablished in Somerset House as the Inland Revenue Laboratory (with Phillips remaining in charge). It was also known as the Somerset House Laboratory. Under the Inland Revenue, the Laboratory&#x27;s work expanded to encompass the testing of many different substances, including food, beer and spirits, as well as tobacco.

Phillips retired as principal chemist in 1874. James Bell was then the principal chemist of Somerset House Laboratory until his retirement in 1894. He was replaced as principal chemist by Sir Thomas Edward Thorpe. At the same time, the laboratory was amalgamated with a similar facility that had been established within HM Customs and it was renamed the Government Laboratory. In 1897, Thorpe moved the Government Laboratory from Somerset House to a new building of his own design.

====Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths====
In 1837, following the establishment of civil registration in the United Kingdom, the Registrar General of Births, Marriages and Deaths set up his office in the North Wing of Somerset House, establishing a connection that lasted for over 130 years. This office held all birth, marriage and death certificates in England and Wales until 1970, when the Registry and its associated archives were moved to nearby St Catherine&#x27;s House at Aldwych.

From 1859 until 1998, the Principal Registry of the Court of Probate (latterly the Principal Probate Registry of the Family Division) was based in Somerset House, prior to its move to First Avenue House, High Holborn.

====Other public offices====
In addition to the learned societies, the ground floor rooms of the North Wing housed the Hawkers and Pedlars Office (on the west side) and the Hackney Coach Office, the Lottery Office, the Privy Seal and Signet Offices (on the east side). The Hackney Coach commissioners had been established on a permanent footing in 1694, while the Board of Commissioners of Hawkers, Pedlars and Petty Chapmen dated from 1698; the latter was abolished in 1810 and its work taken over by the Hackney Coach Office until its abolition in 1831, whereupon responsibility for licensing both of hackney carriages and of travelling traders passed to the Stamp Office. The Lottery Office, established in 1779, was also abolished in 1831 and its residual business likewise passed to the Stamp Office. The Signet Office was abolished in 1851 and the Privy Seal Office in 1884.

One of the first occupants of the building had been the Duchy of Cornwall Office. It was accommodated in the East Wing along with the Tax Office and various Exchequer offices (including the Pipe Office, the Lord Treasurer&#x27;s Remembrancer&#x27;s Office and the Office of the Clerk of the Estreats). As early as 1795 the Exchequer was requesting that more space be made available; Sir John Soane was engaged to redesign their offices, and as part of the scheme the Duchy was relocated to another part of the East Wing, prompting complaints from its officers. Pipe rolls and other ancient records of the Treasury and Exchequer (which had been moved to Somerset House from the Palace of Westminster in 1793) remained stored in the basements until the establishment of the Public Record Office in 1838.

The office of Lord Treasurer&#x27;s Remembrancer ceased to exist in 1833 and the Pipe Office was abolished in 1834; however space in Somerset House continued to be at a premium: in 1854 an act of Parliament, the Duchy of Cornwall Office Act 1854 (17 &amp; 18 Vict. c. 93), was passed, noting that the Duchy&#x27;s rooms in Somerset House were now needed &quot;for the use of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, whose present office is insufficient for the Business thereof, and adjoins the said Office of the Duchy of Cornwall&quot;. The act provided for the Duchy Office to move to new, purpose-built premises in Pimlico: now known as 10 Buckingham Gate, the building still serves as head office for the Duchy.

From 1785 the Commissioners for Auditing Public Accounts were also housed in the East Wing, as was the Duchy of Lancaster Office (having moved there from accommodation in Gray&#x27;s Inn) until it moved in 1823 to new offices across the road in Lancaster Place. The Surveyor of Crown Lands also had his office here until the early 19th century. The Salt Office initially occupied rooms in the West Wing, alongside the naval offices, but it was abolished in 1798 (administration of the salt tax having been transferred to the Board of Excise).

During the 19th century the North Wing contained, in addition, the offices of the Poor Law Commissioners (1834–47) and the Tithe Commissioners (1836–51), who also acted as the Copyhold Commissioners.

===19th-century expansion===

Magnificent as the new building was, it was something short of what Chambers had intended, for he had planned for an additional terrace of houses to the east, as well as to the west of the quadrangle; work had stopped short, however, cost being the inhibiting factor. Eventually King&#x27;s College London was erected to the east (the government granting the land on condition that the design conformed to Chambers&#x27; original design) by subscription between 1829 and 1834; the architect was Sir Robert Smirke. At the same time, as part of Smirke&#x27;s scheme, the eastern third of the river frontage was completed, following Chambers&#x27;s original design.

Then, increasing demand for space led to another and last step. The western edge of the site was occupied by a row of houses used as dwellings for Admiralty officials who worked in the South Wing. Between 1851 and 1856, this terrace was substantially expanded and remodelled to provide the Inland Revenue with an entire new wing of additional office accommodation. As part of this development, its architect James Pennethorne created a monumental new façade alongside the approach road to Waterloo Bridge (which had not been in existence when Chambers was alive). 150 years later this part of the building is still known as the &quot;&quot;New&quot; Wing&quot;.

In 1891 a headquarters building was constructed in the West Court (between the West Wing and the New Wing) for the Civil Service Rifles, a Rifle Volunteer Corps.

===20th-century modifications===

By the start of the First World War the Civil Service Rifles, by then renamed the 15th (Prince of Wales&#x27; Own Civil Service Rifles) Battalion, The London Regiment, had its own Morris tube firing range (where the calibre of the rifle is reduced for indoor operation by a use of a tube) fitted with vanishing and running targets at Somerset House.

Somerset House had its share of trials and tribulations during the London blitz in the Second World War. Apart from comparatively minor blast effects at various times, sixteen rooms and the handsome rotunda staircase (the Nelson Stair) were completely destroyed in the South Wing, and a further 27 damaged in the West Wing by a direct hit in October 1940.

Still more windows were shattered and balustrades toppled, but the worst was over by the end of May 1941. It was not until the 1950s that this damage to the South Wing was repaired. The work required skilled masons, whose services were hard to come by in the early post-war years. Sir Albert Richardson was appointed architect for the reconstruction. He skillfully recreated the Nelson Room and rebuilt the Nelson Stair. The work was completed in 1952 at a cost of (then) £84,000.
In 1984 the (c. 21) was passed, legislating the way for Somerset House to be redeveloped as a centre for the arts. In 1997 the Somerset House Trust was established as a registered charity to maintain the building and develop it as a centre for arts and culture.

In the late 20th century the building began to be reinvigorated as a centre for the visual arts. The first institution to move in (in 1989) was the Courtauld Institute of Art, including the Courtauld Gallery, which has an important collection of old master and impressionist paintings. The Courtauld occupies the North Wing. 

===21st-century redevelopment===

The main courtyard, which had been used as a Civil Service car park, and the main terrace overlooking the Thames were refurbished and opened to the public, these alterations being overseen by the conservation architects Donald Insall &amp; Associates. Grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund financed the conversion of the South Wing between 1999 and 2003: a visitor centre featuring audio-visual displays on the history of the building, the gilded state barge of the Lord Mayor of the City of London and a shop and café were opened, overlooking the river. The Gilbert Collection of decorative arts, and the Hermitage Rooms, which staged exhibitions of items loaned from the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, moved into the same area. The last Hermitage exhibition took place in 2007 and the Gilbert Collection galleries closed in 2008; the collection moved into new galleries at the Victoria and Albert Museum in June 2009. Somerset House now puts on a programme of art exhibitions, drawing on various sources.

In stages from 2009 to 2013, HM Revenue and Customs withdrew from the other parts of the building; since March 2013 the Somerset House Trust has had oversight of the entire complex. Its management policy has been to rent out the upper floors at a commercial rate to &quot;creative businesses&quot;, while devoting the ground floor to &quot;public realm&quot; activities. The trust receives no public subsidy and relies on income from rent and private hire to fund the upkeep of the estate and relies on ticket sales, merchandising and sponsorship to fund its artistic and cultural programme.
In the winter the central courtyard is home to a popular open-air ice rink, as seen during the opening credits of the 2003 Christmas-themed film &quot;Love Actually&quot;. At other times, 55 vertical jets of water rise to random heights from an array of fountains.
The courtyard is also used as a concert venue. In July each year the &quot;Summer series&quot; of music events takes place, which has included performances from artists such as Lily Allen. 

Somerset House now has more than a hundred tenants, comprising a large and diverse collection of creative organisations and artists including Dance Umbrella, 7Wonder, Hofesh Shechter Company and the Royal Society of Literature. The largest tenant is King&#x27;s College London, whose Cultural Institute, Executive Centre and Dickson Poon School of Law occupy the East Wing, which is adjacent to its historic College Building of 1831.

====Filming location====
Somerset House is a popular filming location, with its exterior featuring in several big-budget Hollywood films. These include two James Bond films, &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1995) and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997), and several scenes of the 2003 film &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot;, starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, were filmed in the courtyard of Somerset House. The courtyard was also used in the 1991 comedy &quot;King Ralph&quot;. Elements of the 2008 film &quot;The Duchess&quot;, starring Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes, were filmed in October 2007.

<text>The president of the Republic of El Salvador () is the head of state and head of government of El Salvador. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of El Salvador.

The office of president of El Salvador was created by the 1841 constitution of El Salvador. Nayib Bukele has served as President of El Salvador since 1 June 2019.

Since 1962, presidential terms are five years long. The constitution has prohibited presidential re-election for most of Salvadoran history with some exceptions during the mid 1800s. Since 1983, the constitution has permitted non-consecutive re-election once, and since 2021, the Supreme Court of Justice has interpreted the constitution as allowing immediate re-election once; presidents are only allowed to serve up to two terms.

Each 1 June, the president is accountable to the Legislative Assembly for the contributions and government development that the president, the vice president and the Council of Ministers developed from the beginning of the presidential term.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

In 1824, the state of El Salvador drafted its first constitution which created the office of Head of State, the precursor of the presidency. When El Salvador declared independence from the Federal Republic of Central America in 1841, its new constitution created the office of President of El Salvador.

In 1841, El Salvador was constituted as an independent and sovereign nation after the rupture of the Federal Republic of Central America in 1838. At that time, the legislative body created a constitution to legitimize the nation of El Salvador and also named Juan Lindo provisional president of the Republic of El Salvador on 2 February 1841. It was not until 26 September 1842 Juan José Guzmán was elected by the people as President of El Salvador. From that moment, the republic suffered a constant series of provisional governments that brought many leaders to power.

In 1858, Captain General Gerardo Barrios became president in which his government gave entrance to the &quot;French Bread&quot;. He resigned from power in 1863 and Francisco Dueñas became president.

It was not until the 1886 constitution of the El Salvador was ratified when the presidential term is increased from two to four years, beginning and ending the presidential terms on 1 March. In 1913, before the death of Manuel Enrique Araujo, a family dynasty would begin. The Meléndez-Quiñonez Dynasty lasted 18 years until Arturo Araujo became president.

=== Military dictatorship ===

In 1931, a coup d&#x27;état led by Vice President General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez overthrew Arturo Araujo. This dictatorial government would establish the foundations of a rigid and totally militarized nation. It was not until 1939 when General Martínez called for a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution which established that the presidential term would be increased from 4 to 6 years and would begin and end on 1 January. During his presidency, Martínez initiated &quot;La Matanza&quot; which killed 25,000 indigenous peoples. Martínez would be overthrown 12 years later in 1944 and General Andrés Ignacio Menéndez became provisional president.

From that moment, the presidency once again showed dictatorial instability and military governments began to be established to the point of creating a republic with military authoritarianism which would end in 1982. In 1950, Lieutenant Colonel Óscar Osorio constitutionally became the president of the Republic and a new constitution was drafted where the presidential term would be 6 years and begin and end on 14 September. Osorio was known as the president of the social programs since he implemented and founded programs such as the Urban Housing Institute (IVU), the Autonomous Port Executive Commission (CEPA) among others that benefited the nation.

In 1960, a coup d&#x27;état overthrew President José María Lemus which led to the formation of a Junta of Government which would later be overthrown by the Civic-Military Directory in 1961. This was the case until the constitutional order was reestablished and another constitution was created in 1962 which would bring with it significant presidential reforms. From that moment, the presidential term would last 5 years and begin and end on 1 July.

On 15 October 1979, the last coup d&#x27;état in Salvadoran history took place where a group of young soldiers and officers overthrew General Carlos Humberto Romero. The coup marked the beginning of the Salvadoran Civil War which would rage on from 1979 to 1992. The Revolutionary Government Junta was established and ruled over El Salvador while fighting against the communist guerrilla group Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN). The Junta was abolished in 1982 and Álvaro Magaña became President of the Republic.

=== Current constitution ===

The 1983 Constituent Assembly decided to create the 1983 constitution of El Salvador which set presidential terms to 5 years and would begin and end on June 1. The civil war greatly affected the political stability of the country.

President José Napoleón Duarte would lead the government against the FMLN from 1984 to 1989. In 1989, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) won the 1989 presidential election. Alfredo Cristiani became the first president of ARENA. ARENA won the presidential elections in 1989, 1994, 1999, and 2004. Its presidents were Alfredo Cristiani, Armando Calderón Sol, Francisco Flores, and Antonio Saca.

The Civil War ended in 1992 and the FMLN became a legal political party in accordance to the Chapultepec Peace Accords.

In 20 years of government, El Salvador was characterized by the privatization of national services such as coffee, telecommunications, the pension system, the National Bank, the Electric Power Service, among others. In 2001, the Economic Dollarization System was carried out in the country, a measure adopted by then President Francisco Flores which would have great long-term consequences for the Salvadoran economy and adopted the US dollar as legal currency.

Mauricio Funes won the 2009 presidential election ending 20 years of ARENA rule and marked the first FMLN presidency. Salvador Sánchez Cerén became the second FMLN president in 2014 after narrowly defeating Norman Quijano.

In 2019, Nayib Bukele, from the Grand Alliance for National Unity (GANA), won the 2019 presidential election ending 10 years of FMLN rule. He was the first president since Duarte to not be a member of either ARENA or FMLN. He was the second president from Palestinian descent, after Saca. He was inaugurated on 1 June 2019.

== Selection process ==

=== Eligibility ===

According to the 1983 constitution and the Law of Policial Parties, a candidate for the presidency must be at least 30 years old. A candidate must also be either a Salvadoran citizen by birth or have a parent who is a Salvadoran citizen. Candidates cannot have had their rights as a citizen suspended within the 6 years prior to an election, and all candidates must be affiliated with a political party registered with the Supreme Electoral Court.

Several individuals are explicitly prohibited by constitution from seeking the office of president. Neither the president of the Legislative Assembly nor the president of the Supreme Court of Justice may run for president &quot;during the year prior to the day the presidential term begins&quot;. Cabinet ministers, vice ministers, and the directors of government institutions are also prohibited to seek the presidency under the same one year restriction, as are the vice president, anyone designated by the Legislative Assembly as a presidential designate, and the incumbent president&#x27;s fourth-degree relatives. Active military personnel, former military personnel who had not yet been retired for three years, and the clergy are also prohibited from seeking the presidency.

=== Electoral process ===

During the 1800s and early 1900s, very few presidential elections were free and fair and political violence was common. During the 1950s, the president was elected through first-past-the-post voting, and during the 1960s and 1970s, the Legislative Assembly elected the president if no candidate received an absolute majority. Since the ratification of the 1983 constitution, a presidential candidate must receive an absolute majority (50%+1) to win a presidential election; if no candidate receives an absolute majority, a second round between the two candidates with the most valid votes would be held within one month of the first round.

== Constitutional framework ==

=== Powers and duties ===

According to the 1983 constitution, the is a part of the executive branch of the Salvadoran government along with the vice president and the cabinet. The president appoints his cabinet ministers, vice ministers, and the governors of El Salvador&#x27;s 14 departments (the equivalent of states or provinces). The president serves as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of El Salvador and is in charge of El Salvador&#x27;s foreign affairs.

The president is allowed to submit legislation to the Legislative Assembly for approval. The president is also allowed to veto any legislation passed by the Legislative Assembly, but the legislature can override a veto with a two-third majority vote. The president can challenge the constitutionality of law before the Supreme Court of Justice, but if the court rules the legislation is constitution, the president is required to sign the legislation into law.

=== Checks and balances ===

The Legislative Assembly exerts some checks on the president&#x27;s power as provided by the constitution. The president requires the approval of the Legislative Assembly in order to leave El Salvador for any reason. The president is also required to report anything to the Legislative Assembly upon request with the exception of military secrets, as well as to address the Legislative Assembly at the start of every calendar year regarding the prior year&#x27;s government affairs. The Legislative Assembly is able to impeach and remove the president with a two-thirds majority vote. The president cannot ratify international treaties without the approval of the Legislative Assembly.

The length of presidential terms has varied throughout Salvadoran history. From 1841 to 1864, presidential terms lasted two years. From 1864 to 1871, presidential terms were extended to last four years. Two year terms were briefly restored from 1871 to 1872 before being reverted back to four year terms. Four-year long presidential terms remained extant (with a brief reduction to three years between 1883 and 1886) until the 1939 constitution extended presidential terms to six years. Term lengths were briefly reverted back to four years in 1946 before being extended back to six years in 1950. Since 1962, presidential terms have been five years long.

=== Re-election ===

For most of Salvadoran history, either immediate re-election or re-election entirely was prohibited. The 1841 constitution allowed presidents to seek re-election after having left office for at least one full term. The 1864 constitution permitted for an incumbent president to seek re-election immediately, but the 1871 constitution restored the requirement of presidents to wait one full term before being eligible for re-election. This restoration was short-lived as the 1872 prohibited re-election entirely. This prohibition on re-election persisted until 1983; the 1983 constitution prohibits individuals from seeking re-election who served as president in the six months &quot;during the period immediately before&quot; or for the last six months &quot;before the beginning of the presidential term&quot;. The constitution prohibits presidents from serving three or more terms. The constitution mandates the country&#x27;s armed forces to intervene in the country&#x27;s politics if a president seeks illegal re-election.

In May 2021, the Legislative Assembly removed and replaced the five justices of the Supreme Court of Justice&#x27;s Constitutional Chamber. In September 2021, the new justices ruled that constitution in fact permits immediate re-election, arguing that the constitution reads that individual who served as president prior to the incumbent term was actually prohibited from seeking re-election rather than the incumbent president. This interpretation of the constitution was criticized as unconstitutional by lawyers, politicians, and activists.

The only six presidents in Salvadoran history have successfully been re-elected: Doroteo Vasconcelos, Francisco Dueñas, Santiago González, Rafael Zaldívar, Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, and Bukele.

<text>King Narai the Great (, , ) or Ramathibodi III ( ) was the 27th monarch of Ayutthaya Kingdom, the 4th and last monarch of the Prasat Thong dynasty. He was the king of Ayutthaya Kingdom from 1656 to 1688 and arguably the most famous king of the Prasat Thong dynasty.

His reign was the most prosperous during the Ayutthaya period and saw the great commercial and diplomatic activities with foreign nations including the Middle East and the West. During the later years of his reign, Narai gave his favorite – the Greek adventurer Constantine Phaulkon – so much power that Phaulkon technically became the chancellor of the state. Through the arrangements of Phaulkon, the Siamese kingdom came into close diplomatic relations with the court of Louis XIV and French soldiers and missionaries filled the Siamese aristocracy and defense. The dominance of French officials led to frictions between them and the native mandarins and led to the turbulent revolution of 1688 towards the end of his reign.

Narai&#x27;s reign was also known for the 1662–1664 invasion of Burma, the destruction of the briefly independent port city of the Sultanate of Singgora (1605–1680), and the conflict he had with the English East India Company.

The presence of numerous foreigners from the French Jesuits to the Persian delegates has left historians with rich sources of material on the city of Ayutthaya and its conflicts and courtly life in the seventeenth century that otherwise would not have survived the complete destruction of the capital in 1767.

==Birth and name==
Prince Narai was born on 16 February 1632 to King Prasat Thong and his consort, Princess Sirithida (), who was a daughter of Songtham. Prasat Thong had just usurped the throne from the ruling Ayutthaya dynasty in 1629 and founded a dynasty of his own. Narai had an siblings younger sister Princess Si Suphan (or &quot;Princess Ratcha Kanlayani&quot;), elder half-brother Prince Chai, and an uncle Prince Si Suthammaracha.

The &quot;Royal Chronicle of Ayutthaya: Royal Recension Version&quot; recorded that &quot;In that year [1633], the princess consort gave birth to a son. When the royal family glanced at the infant, they saw the baby had four arms before having two arms as normal. Upon learning this, the king thought it was a miracle. He therefore named his son Narai.&quot; The name &quot;Narai&quot; is from Sanskrit &quot;Narayana&quot;, a name of Hindu god Vishnu who has four arms.

==Succession==
Upon Prasat Thong&#x27;s death in 1656, Prince Chai succeeded his father as King Sanpet VI.

However, it was a Thai tradition to give brothers a higher priority over sons in succession. Prince Sudharmmaraja plotted with his nephew, Prince Narai, to bring Sanpet VI down. After nine months of ascension, Sanpet VI was executed following a coup. Narai and his uncle marched into the palace, and Si Suthammaracha crowned himself king. Si Suthammaracha appointed Narai as the &quot;Uparaja&quot;, or Viceroy of the Front Palace. However, Narai was also an ambitious prince and had requested Dutch support against his uncle. Si Suthammaracha&#x27;s rule was weak and he fell under the control of &quot;Chao Phraya&quot; Chakri, an ambitious mandarin who also wanted the throne.

In 1656, Narai and his uncle finally alienated each other. Si Suthammaracha lusted after Narai&#x27;s sister, Princess Ratcha Kanlayani. He ordered his soldiers to surround her residence and entered the house. The princess hid in a book chest and it was smuggled into the Front Palace, where she reunited with her brother.

Enraged at his uncle&#x27;s behavior, Narai decided to take action. He drew his support from the Persian and Japanese mercenaries that had been persecuted during his father&#x27;s reign. He was also supported by the Dutch East India Company, as well as his brothers and the &quot;Okya&quot; Sukhothai, a powerful nobleman. On the Day of Ashura, the Persians, Japanese and Dutch stormed the palace. The prince engaged in single combat with his uncle, until the king fled to the Rear Palace. Si Suthammaracha was captured and was executed at Wat Khok Phraya on 26 October 1656.

==Domestic policy==

Domestic policies in King Narai&#x27;s reign were greatly affected by the interference of foreign powers most notably the Chinese to the north, the Dutch to the South, and the English who were making their first forays into India to the west. Policies revolved around either directly countering the influence, or creating a delicate balance of power between the different parties.

In 1660, the Chinese invaded the Burmese capital at Ava to capture Zhu Youlang, the last Southern Ming emperor. Sensing a possible weakening of Burmese influence in the northern vassal states, King Narai began the Burmese–Siamese War of 1662–64 to bring Chiang Mai under the direct control of Ayutthaya. Although the expedition was successful in taking control of Lampang and other smaller cities, a second expedition had to be conducted to bring Chiang Mai under control in 1662. After stopping a Burmese army incursion in 1663 at Sai Yok, Narai led an army of 60,000 in an invasion of Burma, capturing Martaban, Syriam, Rangoon, Hongsawadi, and then in 1664 laid siege to Pagan. After &quot;causing many casualties in dead and wounded and capturing many prisoners of war&quot;, the Siamese retreated.

Narai also handed over control of Mergui to French officer Chevalier de Beauregard and his small French garrison. At the same time, he also granted a concession of the strategic port of Bangkok to Beauregard, with the view of countering Dutch influence.

King Narai also built a new palace at present-day Lopburi (&quot;Louvo&quot; in the French accounts) utilising the expertise of Jesuit architects and engineers. European influences are clearly evident in the architectural style, especially the use of wide windows. The move to Lopburi was arguably prompted by the Dutch naval blockade of Ayutthaya in 1664 to enforce a fur monopoly.

==Foreign affairs==

Although Catholic missions had been present in Ayutthaya as early as 1567 under Portuguese Dominicans, King Narai&#x27;s reign saw the first concerted attempt to convert the monarch to Catholicism under the auspices of French Jesuits who were given permission to settle in Ayutthaya in 1662. The conversion attempt ultimately failed and arguably backfired but Catholics were to remain in Siam up to the present day.

The most remarkable aspect of King Narai&#x27;s reign were the diplomatic missions that he sent and received during his reign. Missions were sent as far afield as France, England, and the Vatican, although at least two missions were lost at sea. Ties with states closer to Ayutthaya were not neglected as missions were also sent to Persia, Golconda (India), China, as well as other neighbouring states.

Undoubtedly, the most celebrated of these missions were those to Europe, in particular France. In 1673, a French ecclesiastical mission arrived at the Siamese court with letters from Pope Clement IX and King Louis XIV of France. King Narai reciprocated by sending a mission to France in 1680 led by Phya Pipatkosa. Although the mission was lost at sea near Madagascar, the French would respond positively by sending a commercial mission to Ayutthaya headed by Monsignor Pallu in 1682.

===Rising French influence===

Most controversially, King Narai allowed the rise of Constantine Phaulkon, a Greek adventurer who first arrived in Ayutthaya in 1675, formerly worked for the English East India Company. Phaulkon was introduced into the court by minister of foreign affairs and trade Kosa Lek in 1681 as a quick-witted interpreter and quickly gained the royal favor. In 1682 he served as the interpreter during the royal audience with François Pallu, who arrived with letters from Louis XIV. Within a few years, Phaulkon had managed to ingratiate himself with the king and became Narai&#x27;s closest counselor. Phaulkon suggested a plan for the reconstruction of the fort of Mergui in polygonal European style, which was strongly opposed by Kosa Lek. Kosa Lek was later accused of receiving bribes from peasants who did not want to be drafted into the Mergui construction. He was flogged to death under royal orders.

The second half of Narai&#x27;s reign was a period of growing French influence as facilitated by Phaulkon. Under Phaulkon&#x27;s guidance, King Narai balanced the influence of the Dutch by favouring the French. Phaulkon also encouraged French interest by initially leading them to believe that the king was about to convert to Catholicism. Although King Narai did display a degree of interest in Catholicism, he also displayed an equal interest in Islam and there is no concrete evidence that he wished to convert to either. However, both Catholic and Islamic missions were to come to the conclusion that Phaulkon was responsible for their failures. Siamese courtiers also resented Phaulkon&#x27;s influence and he quickly became the focus of xenophobic sentiments at court, with the future King Phetracha at their head.

Narai responded the French by the dispatch of Siamese mission to France in January 1684 led by &quot;Khun&quot; Pijaivanit and &quot;Khun&quot; Pijitmaitri accompanied by missionary Benigne Vachet. They reached Calais by November and eventually had the French royal audience. Louis XIV sent de Chaumont as chief ambassador, and de Choisy to lead the French mission in 1685 to return the Siamese ambassadors and to convert Narai to Catholicism. The mission contained a large number of Jesuit priests and scientists. Colbert sent his letter to Phaulkon to instruct him to persuade the Siamese king to concede to French requests with the promises of granting him the rank of count.


Though he did not convert to Christianity, Narai agreed to allow the French troops to be stationed in Siamese ports. Chevalier de Forbin was made commander of the Bangkok fort and trained Siamese armies in Western warfare. Several Siamese forts including Mergui, Ligor, Singora (Songkhla), Lavo, and Ayutthaya itself were reconstructed in European style. Another Siamese mission to France was led by &quot;Phra&quot; Visutsundhorn (Kosa Pan, younger brother of Kosa Lek) and Guy Tachard in 1686 with enthusiastic European reception. A fragmentary Siamese account of the mission compiled by Kosa Pan was re-discovered in Paris in the 1980s. In 1686, a revolt broke out in Ayutthaya, caused by the Makassars whom were seeking asylum in Siam after being expelled by the Dutch Empire. Constantine Phaulkon and Forbin mobilized the defence of the Kingdom, with the forces of Ayutthaya made up from a coalition of French, English and Siamese troops. The Makassars were subsequently defeated and Narai had many burnt at the stake.

Samuel White, the English governor of Mergui fort, appointed by Narai and a close associate of Phaulkon, entered into conflict with the English fleets from India in 1687, leading to the English blockade of Mergui. The Siamese native mandarins massacred the local Englishmen out of frustration. With English fleets threatening his kingdom, Narai decided to placate the English and executed the mandarins.

In 1687 the new French mission left Brest for Ayutthaya. The mission included Kosa Pan returning home, Guy Tachard again, Simon de La Loubère, Claude Céberet du Boullay, and General Desfarges. A French army regiment was sent with this mission to be stationed in Siamese forts with Desfarges as the military commander. Narai agreed to station French troops at Mergui and Bangkok, both with Western-style forts. Desfarges was stationed at Bangkok. (The fort is now called the Vijaiprasit Fort later the royal fort of King Taksin). The last Siamese embassy was led by Ok-khun Chamnan in 1688 visiting Rome and Pope Innocent XI.

==The &quot;Revolution&quot; of 1688==

Narai spent his whole reign reducing the power of native mandarins that had caused much bloodshed during his predecessors’ time. He firstly supported Persian, and later, the French guards and advisors, against the Thai mandarins. Even his ascension to the throne was orchestrated by Persian mercenaries. The French eventually enjoyed special favors from religious affairs to the military activities. One of the critical turning points was concerned with the construction of the French forts and military barracks in Bangkok, near the mouth of the Chao Phraya River. In dealing with the activities, the French mostly depended on Constantine Phaulkon, the king&#x27;s favorite. The threat of the French military presence reportedly was felt among the court nobles. All in all, factionalism, favoritism and nepotism became widespread. The native mandarins somehow managed to retain their powers, most notably Kosa Lek.

Petracha, Commander of the Royal Regiment of Elephants, emerged as the leading &quot;nationalist&quot;. Petracha had familial connections to Narai, with his mother being the king&#x27;s wet nurse and his sister being the king&#x27;s concubine.

Narai was said to fear fathering a son. He therefore ordered abortions to be carried out on any of his impregnated consorts. However he adopted the son of a minor mandarin with the name of Phra Pi and named him his successor. The young prince was embraced by the French, who managed to convert him to Catholicism.
Matters were brought to a head when King Narai fell gravely ill in March 1688 while staying in his Lopburi palaces. Aware of the coming succession dispute, in May 1688, Narai called together his closest councillors: Phaulkon, Phra Phetracha, and Phra Pi, and nominated his daughter, Kromluang Yothathep, to succeed him. The three councillors were to act as regents until the princess took on a partner of her choice from one of the two Siamese councillors.

When Narai was seriously ill with no hopes of recovery, on 18 May 1688 Phetracha had a successful coup and arrested Narai himself, Phra Pi, and his half-brothers Prince Aphaithot and Prince Noi. Phaulkon was summoned to the palace, there he and his French officers were surrounded and disarmed. Phaulkon was thrown to the palace dungeon and brutally tortured.

After questioning Phra Pi, he discovered Phra Pi had conspired with Phaulkon to assume the throne, and Phra Pi was executed on 20 May. Further questioning of Phaulkon revealed a plot to raise a rebellion, and he too was executed by Phetracha&#x27;s adopted son Luang Sorasak on 5 June. Narai, on his deathbed, was unable to do anything, except curse Phetracha and his son. Luang Sorasak then had Prince Aphaithot and Prince Noi executed.

Phetracha soon ordered his troops to attack the French troops led by General Desfarges at the start of the Siege of Bangkok. On the death of King Narai on 10/11 July, Phetracha proclaimed himself king. After withholding the siege for four months and later a negotiated settlement, the French soldiers were allowed to return to France. Only the Dutch were allowed to trade in the capital before the French and English finally ended their dispute with Siam.

==Legacy==

Although King Narai&#x27;s reign witnessed the greatest extent of foreign influence at the Siamese court, his diplomatic achievements were to be reversed by his successor. It is debatable whether the new introspective attitude of his successors contributed to the weakening and eventual fall of Ayutthaya. On the other hand, the curtailing of foreign influences in the court may have prevented the colonisation of Ayutthaya. Nevertheless, his reign&#x27;s diplomatic achievements contributed to him being posthumously styled &quot;the Great,&quot; one of seven recognised as such in the history of Thailand.

At the same time, the records of those involved in the diplomatic missions, particularly those from the west, have allowed historians to obtain a rare glimpse into the world of the Ayutthayan court as most original Ayutthaya records were destroyed with the city in 1767. These include the French accounts of the Chevalier de Chaumont, the Abbé de Choisy, Fr. Tachard, Claude de Forbin, de la Loubere and the Persian account of Muhammad Rabi&#x27; ibn Muhammad Ibrahim. Domestically, the relative stability during his reign also gave rise to the revival of Siamese literature during his reign.
Further afield, one of the main streets of the city of Brest as well as another in Marseilles have been named &quot;Rue de Siam&quot; to commemorate Narai&#x27;s missions, whilst an ancient street in Lopburi Province, where Narai dwelt at the time he received the Chevalier de Chaumont, has been named &quot;Rue de France&quot; by the Thai government in 1985 to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the relations between the two countries.

In addition, among the gifts that were exchanged between the Siamese and the French courts, two items from Siam were to have an unexpected impact on French history. The items were a pair of silver cannons that were eventually stored in the Royal Furniture Repository in Paris since they were classed as gifts rather than weapons. After failing to find usable weapons at the Arsenal, rioting Parisians broke into the Repository and discovered some 20 cannons. However, the Siamese cannons were the only ones that still functioned, and so they were hauled to the Bastille. The date was 14 July 1789.

In King Narai&#x27;s reign, Thai literature flourished, especially royal panegyrics. The &quot;Eulogy of King Prasat Thong&quot; about the king&#x27;s father was probably composed early in the reign, and the &quot;Eulogy of King Narai&quot; around 1680.

King Narai Hospital, the main hospital of Lopburi Province is named after him.

<text>East Harlem, also known as Spanish Harlem, or , is a neighborhood of Upper Manhattan in New York City, north of the Upper East Side and bounded by 96th Street to the south, Fifth Avenue to the west, and the East and Harlem Rivers to the east and north. Despite its name, it is generally not considered to be a part of Harlem proper, but it is one of the neighborhoods included in Greater Harlem.

The neighborhood has one of the largest Hispanic communities in New York City, mostly Puerto Ricans, as well as Dominicans, Cubans, and Mexicans. The community is notable for its contributions to Latin freestyle and salsa music. East Harlem also includes the remnants of a once predominant Italian community, or Italian Harlem. The Chinese population has increased dramatically in East Harlem since 2000.

East Harlem has historically suffered from many social issues, such as a high crime rate, the highest jobless rate in New York City, teenage pregnancy, AIDS, drug abuse, homelessness, and an asthma rate five times the national average. It has the second-highest concentration of public housing in the United States, behind Brownsville, Brooklyn. East Harlem is undergoing some gentrification, and in 2016 the city considered rezoning the area.

East Harlem is part of Manhattan Community District 11, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10029 and 10035. It is patrolled by the 23rd and 25th Precincts of the New York City Police Department.

==History==
===Early history===
The area that became East Harlem was rural for most of the 19th century, but residential settlements northeast of Third Avenue and East 110th Street had developed by the 1860s. The construction of the elevated transit line to Harlem in 1879 and 1880, and the building of the Lexington Avenue subway in 1919, urbanized the area, precipitating the construction of apartment buildings and brownstones. The extension of cable cars up Lexington Avenue into East Harlem was stymied by the incline created by Duffy&#x27;s Hill at 103rd Street, one of the steepest grades in Manhattan. East Harlem was first populated by poor German, Irish, Scandinavian, and Eastern European Jewish immigrants, with the Jewish population standing at 90,000 around 1917. In the 1870s, Italian immigrants joined the mix after a contractor building trolley tracks on First Avenue imported Italian laborers as strikebreakers. The workers&#x27; shantytown along the East River at 106th Street was the beginning of an Italian neighborhood, with 4,000 having arrived by the mid-1880s. As more immigrants arrived, it expanded north to East 115th Street and west to Third Avenue.

East Harlem consisted of pockets of ethnically sorted settlements – Italian, German, Irish, and Jewish – which were beginning to press up against each other, with the spaces still between them occupied by &quot;gasworks, stockyards and tar and garbage dumps&quot;. In 1895, the Union Settlement Association, one of the oldest settlement houses in New York City, began providing services in the area, offering the immigrant and low-income residents a range of community-based programs, including boys and girls clubs, a sewing school and adult education classes.
===Italian Harlem===
Southern Italians and Sicilians, with a moderate number of Northern Italians, soon predominated, especially in the area east of Lexington Avenue between 96th and 116th Streets and east of Madison Avenue between 116th and 125th Streets, with each street featuring people from different regions of Italy. The neighborhood became known as &quot;Italian Harlem&quot;, the Italian American hub of Manhattan; it was the first part of Manhattan to be referred to as &quot;Little Italy&quot;. The first Italians arrived in East Harlem in 1878, from Polla in the province of Salerno, and settled in the vicinity of 115th Street.

There were many crime syndicates in Italian Harlem, from the early Black Hand to the bigger and more organized Italian gangs that formed the Italian-American Mafia. It was the founding location of the Genovese crime family, one of the Five Families that dominated organized crime in New York City. This includes the current 116th Street Crew of the Genovese family. During the 1970s, Italian East Harlem was also home to the Italian-American drug gang and murder-for-hire crew known as the East Harlem Purple Gang.

In the 1920s and early 1930s, Italian Harlem was represented in Congress by future Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. After becoming mayor, La Guardia helped plan a large expansion of Thomas Jefferson Park at First Avenue, between 111th and 114th Streets, in the mid-1930s. The neighborhood was represented, in the 1940s, by Italian-American civil rights lawyer, activist, and socialist Vito Marcantonio. The Italian neighborhood approached its peak in the 1930s, with over 110,000 Italian-Americans living in its crowded, run-down apartment buildings. The 1930 census showed that 81 percent of the population of Italian Harlem consisted of first- or second-generation Italian Americans, somewhat less than the concentration of Italian Americans in the Lower East Side&#x27;s Little Italy with 88 percent; Italian Harlem&#x27;s total population, however, was three times that of Little Italy.

The fabric of the Italian-American community was torn when, after the Second World War, the unhealthy tenements started to be demolished and replaced with better housing, forcing families to relocate. Despite this, Italian Harlem endured as a large and conspicuous community through the 1980s and 1990s, and even later, the Italian-American community in East Harlem remained strong in certain areas, particularly around Pleasant Avenue.

Today, the few remaining Italian-American residents in Harlem are predominantly older, clustered around Pleasant Avenue and the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, mainly from 114th to 118th Streets and the surrounding area. According to the 2000 Census, there were only 1,130 Italian-Americans still living in this area.

However, vestiges of the old Italian neighborhood remain. The annual Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the &quot;Dancing of the Giglio&quot;, the first Italian feast in New York City, is still celebrated there every year on the second weekend of August by the Giglio Society of East Harlem and is centered around Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Italian retail establishments still exist in Italian Harlem, such as Rao&#x27;s restaurant, which started in 1896, and the original Patsy&#x27;s Pizzeria, which opened in 1933. Another major Italian retail businesses in the neighborhood, a barbershop opened by Claudio Caponigro on 116th Street in the mid-1950s, was threatened with closure by a rent increase in May 2011 but ultimately closed only in 2019 when Mr. Caponigro retired.

===Spanish Harlem===

Puerto Rican and Latin American migration after the First World War established an enclave at the western portion of East Harlem – around 110th Street and Lexington Avenue – which became known as &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot;. The area slowly grew to encompass all of East Harlem, including Italian Harlem, as Italians moved out – to the Bronx, Brooklyn, Long Island, upstate New York and New Jersey – and Nuyoricans moved in during another wave of immigration in the 1940s and 1950s.

The newly dominant Puerto Rican population, which reached 63,000 in 1950, continued to define the neighborhood according to its needs, establishing bodegas and botánicas as it expanded; by the 1930s there was already an enclosed street market underneath the Park Avenue railroad viaduct between 111th and 116th Streets, called &quot;La Marqueta&quot; (&quot;The Market&quot;). Catholic and evangelistic Protestant churches appeared in storefronts. Although &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot; had been in use since at least the 1930s to describe the Latino enclave – along with &quot;Italian Harlem&quot; and &quot;Negro Harlem&quot; – the name began to be used to describe the entire East Harlem neighborhood by the 1950s. Later, the name &quot;El Barrio&quot; (&quot;The Neighborhood&quot;) began to be used, especially by residents of the area.

===Decline===
In the 1950s and 1960s, large sections of East Harlem were leveled for urban renewal projects, and the neighborhood was one of the hardest hit areas in the 1960s and 1970s as New York City struggled with deficits, race riots, urban flight, gang warfare, drug abuse, crime and poverty. Tenements were crowded, poorly maintained, and frequent targets for arson. In 1969 and 1970, a regional chapter of the Young Lords which were reorganized from a neighborhood street gang in Chicago by Jose (Cha-Cha) Jimenez, ran several programs including a Free Breakfast for Children and a Free Health Clinic to help Latino and poor families. The Young Lords came together with the Black Panthers and called for Puerto Rican independence and neighborhood empowerment.

===Recent history===
By the beginning of the 21st century, East Harlem was a racially diverse neighborhood, with about a third of the population being Puerto Rican. As it has been throughout its history, it is predominantly a working-class neighborhood.

Until 2006, property values in East Harlem climbed along with those in the rest of New York City, leading to gentrification and changes to area demographics.

On March 12, 2014, at 9:00 EDT, a large explosion and fire at 1644–1646 Park Avenue killed eight people and injured more than 70.

The &quot;New York Post&quot; listed one part of the neighborhood – the block of Lexington Avenue between East 123rd and 124th Streets – as one of &quot;the most dangerous blocks in the city&quot; because police crime statistics for 2015 showed that 19 assaults had taken place there, more than for any other city block. The &quot;Post&quot; also reported that there were, according to the Harlem Neighborhood Block Association, &quot;22 drug-treatment programs, four homeless-services providers and four transitional-living facilities&quot; in East Harlem.

East Harlem has begun to feel the effects of gentrification. In February 2016, an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about &quot;New York&#x27;s Next Hot Neighborhoods&quot; featured East Harlem as one of four such areas. A real-estate broker described it as &quot;one of the few remaining areas in New York City where you can secure a good deal&quot;. The article mentioned new luxury developments, access to transportation, the opening of new retail stores, bars and restaurants, and national-brand stores beginning to appear on the outskirts of the neighborhood. Primarily, though, it was the cost of housing in comparison to the rest of Manhattan, which the article noted as the major factor. Beginning in 2016, the New York City government was seeking to rezone East Harlem &quot;to facilitate new residential, commercial, community facility, and manufacturing development&quot;. The residents of the neighborhood generated a suggested zoning plan, the &quot;East Harlem Neighborhood Plan&quot;, which was offered to the city in February 2017, but in August 2017 residents and the Manhattan Borough President, Gale Brewer, complained that the city had ignored their plan almost entirely.

In 2019, the oldest portion of the neighborhood, the blocks of East 111th through 120th Streets between Park and Pleasant Avenues, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the East Harlem Historic District.

The entirety of Manhattan Community District 11, which consists of East Harlem, Randall&#x27;s Island, and Ward&#x27;s Island, had 124,323 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 77.3 years. This is 3.9 years lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most residents are children and middle-aged adults: 21% are between the ages of 0–17, while 33% are between 25 and 44, and 23% are between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 13% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 11 was $36,770.

Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 48% in Community District 11, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Community District 11 is considered to be gentrifying: according to the Community Health Profile, the district was low-income in 1990 and has seen above-median rent growth up to 2010.

In the 2020 census report, East Harlem&#x27;s demographics were separated into north and south parts. North East Harlem had between 30,000 and 39,999 Hispanic residents, 20,000 to 29,999 Black residents, 5,000 to 9,999 White residents, and less than 5000 Asian residents.

===Ethnic groups===
Community District 11 is a mostly low to middle income area. It is made up of first and second generation Puerto Ricans, Dominican Americans, Cuban Americans, African-Americans, Italian-Americans, Asian-Americans, Caribbean Americans and a growing population of Mexican Americans and Salvadoran Americans and other Central American immigrants. It has one of the highest concentrations of Puerto Ricans in all of New York City. As of 2010, the Puerto Rican population was 27.7% in zip code 10029, and 23.4% in 10035. 10035 also has a large Mexican population, at 10.7%.

As noted before, the number of Asians in East Harlem more than doubled between 2000 and 2010, largely due to Chinese people moving to East Harlem. Increasing rents in Lower Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown have driven many into public and subsidized housing developments in the neighborhood. Advocates have been calling for Chinese language services to be available in the community centers to accommodate the growing number of Chinese residents in the area. In 2000, the Chinese population in the northern portion was less than one percent, but by 2010, it has gone up to three percent. In the southern part, it rose from 4.6% to 8.4%.

===Social issues===
Social problems, including concentrated poverty, homelessness, overcrowding, substandard housing, language barriers, food insecurity, teen pregnancy, obesity, crime, drug addiction, dropping out of school, and low rates of advanced educational attainment, have long plagued the area. Although crime rates have dropped from the historically high numbers of the crack epidemic, East Harlem suffers from a high violent crime rate, especially in the 25th Precinct above 115th Street. In 2021, the 25th Precinct had the second-highest rates of felony assault and robbery, the sixteenth-highest rate of rape, and the highest rate of murder out of the New York Police Department&#x27;s 77 precincts.

East Harlem has the highest concentration of shelters and facilities in Manhattan, with eight homeless shelters, 36 drug and alcohol treatment facilities and 37 mental health treatment facilities. It also has the highest jobless rate in the entire city, as well as the city&#x27;s second highest cumulative AIDS rate. The asthma rate is also five times higher than national levels.

==Housing==


East Harlem is dominated by public housing complexes of various types, with a high concentration of older tenement buildings between these developments. The neighborhood contains the second-highest concentration of public housing in the United States, behind Brownsville, Brooklyn. The total land area is .

After a wave of arson ravaged the low income communities of New York City throughout the 1970s, many of the residential structures in East Harlem were left seriously damaged or destroyed. By the late 1970s, the city began to rehabilitate many abandoned tenement style buildings and designate them as low income housing. Despite recent gentrification of the neighborhood, large numbers of apartment buildings have been deliberately kept vacant by their owners. Although the businesses on the ground floor are retained, landlords do not want to have the trouble involved in residential tenants. In some cases, landlords are waiting for a revived economy, warehousing the apartments so that they can rent them later at a higher rent.

In 2007, a survey of Manhattan&#x27;s buildings found that 1,723 were significantly vacant, three-quarters of them north of 96th Street. A 1998 survey found that one-quarter of low-rise residential buildings on avenues or major cross streets in East Harlem had sealed-up residential floors, despite having commercial businesses on the ground floor.

===Fresh food===

A lack of access to healthy food causes serious hardships to citizens of East Harlem, a neighborhood which is considered to be a food desert. According to an April 2008 report prepared by the New York City Department of City Planning, East Harlem is an area of the city with the highest levels of diet-related diseases due to limited opportunities for citizens to purchase fresh foods.

With a high population density and a lack of nearby supermarkets, the neighborhood has little access to fresh fruit and vegetables and a low consumption of fresh foods. Citizens of East Harlem are likely to buy food from grocery stores that have a limited supply of fruits and vegetables, which are often of poor quality and generally more expensive than the same products sold at supermarkets. Compared to the Upper East Side, supermarkets in Harlem are 30% less common. Without access to affordable produce and meats, East Harlem residents have difficulty eating a healthy diet, which contributes to high rates of obesity and diabetes.

<text>King County International Airport , commonly Boeing Field, is a public airport owned and operated by King County, south of downtown Seattle, in the U.S. state of Washington. The airport is sometimes referred to as KCIA (King County International Airport), but it is not the airport identifier. The airport has scheduled passenger service operated by Kenmore Air, a commuter air carrier, and was being served by JSX with regional jet flights. It is also a hub for UPS Airlines. It is also used by other cargo airlines and general aviation aircraft. The airfield is named for founder of Boeing, William E. Boeing, and was constructed in 1928, serving as the city&#x27;s primary airport until the opening of Seattle–Tacoma International Airport in 1944. The airport&#x27;s property is mostly in Seattle just south of Georgetown, with its southern tip extending into Tukwila. The airport covers , averages more than 180,000 operations annually, and has approximately 380 based aircraft.

==History==
Aviation history in Seattle began in 1910 when Charles Hamilton performed an air show at The Meadows racetrack, located on the site of the present-day Museum of Flight. Hamilton executed diving maneuvers and staged a race between an aircraft and an automobile. After crashing and landing in a pond at the center of the track, he repaired his aircraft and resumed flying the following day.

A 1911 Seattle development plan proposed transforming the Duwamish Valley into an industrial zone. William Boeing acquired a shipbuilding facility on the western bank of the Duwamish River, where he founded Pacific Aero Products, later renamed Boeing Airplane Company. The factory manufactured 50 Boeing Model 2 training aircraft during World War I, testing them on a sandy field west of the Duwamish River. This testing ground eventually developed into King County Airport.

In 1928, King County voters approved a $950,000 plan to build the region&#x27;s first municipal airport. The airport&#x27;s proximity to the Boeing Airplane Company and its use by Pacific Air Transport&#x27;s regular airmail service led to its naming as &quot;Boeing Field.&quot; Construction of the runway began on March 28, 1928, using material dredged from the Duwamish River bed. At that time, the airport site was served by three railroad lines and Highway 99.

Construction of the first county-owned hangars began shortly after the airport&#x27;s opening. The administration building and terminal were officially inaugurated on April 21, 1930. Boeing Field served as Seattle&#x27;s sole passenger terminal throughout the 1930s, providing passenger services, flight schedule information, and meteorological data for airlines. Regular flights to Portland and San Francisco were operated by West Coast Air Transport and Pacific Air Transport. These carriers later merged to create United Airlines, which pioneered both 28-hour transcontinental service and the first flight attendant corps comprised of trained nurses.

By 1935, the U.S. Bureau of Air Commerce (later Federal Aviation Administration) began investigating the construction of a new airport elsewhere in King County due to risks associated with the high ridge east of Boeing Field. In the late 1930s, as war threatened Europe, Boeing shifted to round-the-clock operations, intensifying production of B-17 and B-29 bombers, which became crucial support for U.S. efforts during World War II.

Galvin Airport, built in 1941 about five miles south of Boeing Field, later became the region&#x27;s main passenger airport, now known as Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (&quot;SeaTac&quot;). This development changed Boeing Field&#x27;s function, as it evolved into a significant regional general aviation and industrial airport. The first Boeing 707 jet airliner prototype, nicknamed &quot;Dash 80,&quot; departed from Renton Airport and made its inaugural landing at Boeing Field in May 1954, marking aviation&#x27;s entry into the jet age.

A new control tower was constructed at the airport in 1962, though regular airline service from Boeing Field ceased in 1971. In 1981, the Airpark hangar complex was built to accommodate 20 business jets. The Seattle Museum of Flight opened in 1987. An expansion of the Airpark hangar complex in 1988 added 16 more spaces.

The August 1946 OAG lists 24 United Airlines weekday departures, 10 weekly flights on Northwest Airlines and several Pan Am Douglas DC-3s a week to Juneau via Annette Island Airport which was the airfield serving Ketchikan at the time. Northwest moved to SEA in 1947, United moved in 1949, and Pan Am in 1953. West Coast Airlines was operating scheduled passenger Douglas DC-3 service from the airport by November 1946 and served Boeing Field for many years. West Coast successors Air West followed by Hughes Airwest operated scheduled passenger flights including McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jet service until 1971 when Hughes Airwest moved its service to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. West Coast began operating Douglas DC-9-10 jet service from Boeing Field in 1968.
Boeing Field has one passenger airline, Kenmore Air with daily flights to Friday Harbor and Eastsound/Orcas Island. Before 2019, the last scheduled passenger jets were operated by Hughes Airwest with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s in 1971. A proposal by Southwest Airlines in June 2005 was submitted to King County to relocate from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to Boeing Field, but was rejected by King County Executive Ron Sims in October. A similar proposal by Alaska Airlines (a response to the Southwest proposal) was also rejected. Southwest Airlines said it wanted to avoid the heavy fees at Sea-Tac due to its expansion program.

The transfer of ownership of Boeing Field from King County to the Port of Seattle was proposed in 2007 as part of a land swap with land owned by the Port. Boeing Field is planned to handle more cargo traffic, including &quot;overflow&quot; from nearby Sea-Tac, as part of its long-range plans.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 called it a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 34,597 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 35,863 in 2009 and 33,656 in 2010.

==Facilities==
The airport covers at an elevation of 21 feet (6 m). It has two asphalt runways: 14R/32L is 10,007 by 200 feet (3,050 x 61 m) and 14L/32R is 3,709 by 100 feet (1,131 x 30 m).

In the year ending January 1, 2019 the airport had 183,268 aircraft operations, average 502 per day: 79% general aviation, 15% air taxi, 6% airline, and &lt;1% military. 384 aircraft were then based at this airport: 229 single-engine, 40 multi-engine, 88 jet, 26 helicopter, and 1 glider.

The runway numbers were updated from 13/31 to 14/32 in August 2017, due to shifting magnetic headings.

===General aviation===
In addition to tie-down parking areas and hangars for general aviation aircraft, the airport is home for several fixed-base operators (FBOs) including Skyservice, Modern Aviation, and Signature Flight Support. Executive Flight Maintenance and Galvin Flying provides maintenance services. Airlift Northwest operates emergency medical services (EMS) and on-demand helicopter flights.

===Boeing Company===
The Boeing Company has facilities at the airport. Final preparations for delivery of Boeing 737 aircraft after the first test flight are made at Boeing Field. Boeing facilities at the airport have also included a paint hangar and flight test facilities. The initial assembly of the 737 was at Boeing Field in the 1960s because the factory in Renton was at capacity building the Boeing 707 and Boeing 727. After 271 aircraft, production moved to Renton in late 1970.

===Museum of Flight===
The Museum of Flight is on the southwest corner of the field. Among the aircraft on display is the first Boeing 747, the third Boeing 787, and an ex-British Airways Concorde, lent to the museum from BA, a supersonic airliner that landed at Boeing Field on its first visit to Seattle on November 15, 1984. Aircraft on the airfield can be seen from the museum.

===Police and fire response===
The King County International Airport contracts with the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office for police services. Deputies assigned to the airport wear a mix of both Police and Fire uniforms, turnouts etc., which includes single Police, Fire/ARFF patch, and drive King County International Airport Police patrol cars. There are currently 17 patrol officers/sergeants and one chief assigned full-time to the airport. Officers assigned to the airport are also required to obtain a Washington State Fire Fighter One certification and an Emergency Medical Technician certification.

==Airlines and destinations==

===Cargo===


===Previous airline service===
In 1945, Northwest Airlines was operating all flights from the airport with 21-passenger seat Douglas DC-3s with direct service to such major cities as Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN, Milwaukee, Chicago, Detroit and New York City with these eastbound flights making intermediate stops enroute at smaller cities such as Spokane, Great Falls, Missoula, Helena, Billings and other small cities. United Airlines was operating Douglas DC-6, Douglas DC-4 and Douglas DC-3 service from Boeing Field in 1947 with direct, no change of plane flights to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Denver, Boise, Oakland, Burbank, San Diego, Vancouver, B.C., Chicago, Cleveland, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City. At this same time in 1947, United was also operating 20 nonstop flights on a daily basis to Portland, OR as well as a daily nonstop DC-6 flight to San Francisco named &quot;The California&quot; which continued on to Los Angeles on a one stop basis with the airline also operating daily direct service from the airport to smaller cities in Washington state, Oregon, California, Idaho, Nebraska and Iowa. In 1950, Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was operating weekly nonstop Boeing 377 Stratocruiser service from Boeing Field nonstop to Honolulu with this flight continuing on to Manila where connections were offered to Pan Am Douglas DC-4 flights to Hong Kong and Singapore. Pan Am was also operating Douglas DC-4 service from the airport in 1950 nonstop to Fairbanks, AK with direct one stop service to Nome, AK as well as DC-4 nonstop service to Ketchikan, AK (via the Annette Island Airport) with flights continuing on to Juneau, AK followed by Whitehorse, Yukon in Canada and then on to Fairbanks.

In later years, West Coast Airlines operated scheduled passenger flights from Boeing Field to Idaho, Oregon, Washington state, northern California, western Montana, northern Utah, and Calgary in Alberta. The airline&#x27;s April 1968 timetable lists nonstop service to Aberdeen, WA/Hoquiam, WA, Boise, ID, Olympia, WA, Pasco, WA, Portland, OR, Salt Lake City, UT, Spokane, WA, Tacoma, WA, Wenatchee, WA and Yakima, WA operated with primarily with Fairchild F-27 prop-jets as well as Douglas DC-3 and Piper Navajo prop aircraft but also with Douglas DC-9 jets to Portland, Boise and Salt Lake City. West Coast, which had its headquarters in the Seattle area and operated all of its flights from Boeing Field, merged with Pacific Air Lines and Bonanza Air Lines to form Air West (later renamed Hughes Airwest following its acquisition by Howard Hughes in 1970) which continued serving Boeing Field until it moved its passenger service to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) in 1971. Before the move to SEA, in January 1971 Hughes Airwest was operating nonstop McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jet service from the airport to Portland, Spokane and Pasco as well as direct, no change of plane DC-9-30 service to Boise, Calgary, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Twin Falls, Lewiston, Phoenix and Tucson, and was also operating Fairchild F-27 turboprop service from BFI at this time to Astoria, Bend, Ephrata, Hoquiam, Klamath Falls, Lewiston, Olympia, Pasco, Portland, Pullman, Sacramento, Spokane, Tacoma, Walla Walla, Wenatchee and Yakima.

Aeroamerica, an airline based at Boeing Field from 1971 to 1982 which operated Boeing 707 and Boeing 720 jetliners, flew nonstop to Spokane, Washington in 1978. Air Oregon, a commuter airline, operated Swearingen Metro propjets in 1979 nonstop to its hub in Portland, Oregon. Helijet, a helicopter airline based at Vancouver International Airport in British Columbia, operated scheduled Sikorsky S-76 helicopter flights to the Victoria Harbour Heliport in British Columbia with direct one stop service to Helijet&#x27;s Vancouver Harbour Heliport located in the downtown Vancouver, B.C. area.

JSX began service between Boeing Field and Oakland International Airport on July 1, 2019 using Embraer 135 regional jets. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, JSX announced in April 2020 that it would indefinitely cease its flights from Boeing Field.

==ICE flights==
The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against King County in 2020 to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation flights to leave from Boeing Field. The county had previously halted the practice, forcing the flights to be redirected to Yakima Air Terminal. In March 2023, a federal judge issued a court order allowing deportation flights to resume from Boeing Field. For each flight, airport officials allow community members to gather in an observation room and watch the aircraft using the airport&#x27;s video system. Each month, King County updates its website with available information about past deportation flights.

==Accidents at or near BFI==
*On January 2, 1949, a Douglas C-47 Skytrain operated by Seattle Air Charter crashed after takeoff due to ice and frost on the surfaces of the wings. There were 14 fatalities among the three crew and 27 passengers on board.
*On July 19, 1949, a Curtiss C-46 Commando operated by Air Transport Associates crashed into a house after taking off due to loss of power to the left engine. Two passengers were killed out of 32 on board, along with one ground fatality.
*On November 17, 1955, a Douglas C-54 Skymaster operated by Peninsular Air Transport crashed into a residential area 2.5 miles south of Boeing Field. There were 28 fatalities among the 74 passengers and crew.

<text>Myrtus (commonly called myrtle) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It was first described by Swedish botanist Linnaeus in 1753.

Over 600 names have been proposed in the genus, but nearly all have either been moved to other genera or been regarded as synonyms. The genus &quot;Myrtus&quot; has three species recognised today:
*&quot;Myrtus communis&quot; – Common myrtle; native to the Mediterranean region in southern Europe
*&quot;Myrtus nivellei&quot; – Saharan myrtle; native to North Africa
*&quot;Myrtus phyllireaefolia&quot;

==Description==

===Common myrtle===
&quot;Myrtus communis&quot;, the &quot;common myrtle&quot;, is native across the Mediterranean region, Macaronesia, western Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. It is also cultivated.

The plant is an evergreen shrub or small tree, growing to tall. The leaf is entire, 3–5 cm long, with a fragrant essential oil.

The star-like flower has five petals and sepals, and numerous stamens. Petals usually are white. The flower is pollinated by insects.

The fruit is a round berry containing several seeds, most commonly blue-black in colour. A variety with yellow-amber berries is also present. The seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries.

===Saharan myrtle===
&quot;Myrtus nivellei&quot;, the Saharan myrtle, (Tuareg language: &quot;tefeltest&quot;), is endemic to the mountains of the central Sahara Desert. It is found in a restricted range in the Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer Mountains in southern Algeria, and the Tibesti Mountains in northern Chad.

It occurs in small areas of sparse relict woodland at montane elevations above the central Saharan desert plains.

It is a traditional medicinal plant for the Tuareg people.

==Fossil record==
Two hundred and fifty fossil seeds of †&quot;Myrtus palaeocommunis&quot; have been described from middle Miocene strata of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark.

==Uses==

===Gardening===
&quot;Myrtus communis&quot; is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for use as a shrub in gardens and parks. It is often used as a hedge plant, with its small leaves shearing cleanly.

When trimmed less frequently, it has numerous flowers in late summer. It requires a long hot summer to produce its flowers, and protection from winter frosts.

The species and the subspecies &quot;M. communis&quot; subsp. &quot;tarentina&quot; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Culinary===
&quot;Myrtus communis&quot; is used in the islands of Sardinia and Corsica to produce an aromatic liqueur called &quot;Mirto&quot; by macerating it in alcohol. &quot;Mirto&quot; is one of the most typical drinks of Sardinia and comes in two varieties: &quot;mirto rosso&quot; (red) produced by macerating the berries, and &quot;mirto bianco&quot; (white) produced from the less common yellow berries and sometimes the leaves.

Many Mediterranean pork dishes include myrtle berries, and roasted piglet is often stuffed with myrtle sprigs in the belly cavity, to impart an aromatic flavour to the meat.

The berries, whole or ground, have been used as a pepper substitute. They contribute to the distinctive flavor of some versions of Italian Mortadella sausage and the related American Bologna sausage.

In Calabria, a myrtle branch is threaded through dried figs and then baked. The figs acquire a pleasant taste from the essential oils of the herb. They are then enjoyed through the winter months.

===Medicinal===

Myrtle, along with willow tree bark, occupies a minor place in the writings of Hippocrates, Pliny, Dioscorides, Galen, and the Arabian writers. Celsus, for instance, suggested that &#x27;soda in vinegar, or ladanum in myrtle oil and wine&#x27; could be used to treat various ailments of the scalp. It is possible that Myrtle&#x27;s effect was due to high levels of salicylic acid.

In several countries, particularly in Europe and China, there has been a tradition for prescribing this substance for sinus infections. A systematic review of herbal medicines used for the treatment of rhinosinusitis concluded that the evidence that any herbal medicines are beneficial in the treatment of rhinosinusitis is limited, and that for &quot;Myrtus&quot; there is insufficient data to verify the significance of clinical results.
In traditional Persian medicine myrtus communis, specially the leaves, are used to stop bleeding. In a research the aqueous extract of the leaves showed hemostatic activity in the rat tail-bleeding model.

===In myth and ritual===


====Classical====
In Greek mythology and ritual the myrtle was sacred to the goddesses Aphrodite and also Demeter: Artemidorus asserts that in interpreting dreams &quot;a myrtle garland signifies the same as an olive garland, except that it is especially auspicious for farmers because of Demeter and for women because of Aphrodite. For the plant is sacred to both goddesses.&quot; Pausanias explains that one of the Graces in the sanctuary at Elis holds a myrtle branch because &quot;the rose and the myrtle are sacred to Aphrodite and connected with the story of Adonis, while the Graces are of all deities the nearest related to Aphrodite.&quot; Myrtle is the garland of Iacchus, according to Aristophanes, and of the victors at the Theban &quot;Iolaea&quot;, held in honour of the Theban hero Iolaus.

Two myths are connected to the myrtle; in the first, Myrsine was a chaste girl beloved by Athena who outdid all the other athletes, so they murdered her in retaliation. Athena turned her into a myrtle, which became sacred to her. In the second, Myrina was a dedicated priestess of Aphrodite who was either abducted to be married or willingly wished to entered marriage in spite of her vows. In any case, Aphrodite turned her into myrtle, and gave it fragrant smell, as her favourite and sacred plant.

In Rome, Virgil explains that &quot;the poplar is most dear to Alcides, the vine to Bacchus, the myrtle to lovely Venus, and his own laurel to Phoebus.&quot; At the Veneralia, women bathed wearing crowns woven of myrtle branches, and myrtle was used in wedding rituals. In the Aeneid, myrtle marks the grave of the murdered Polydorus in Thrace. Aeneas&#x27; attempts to uproot the shrub cause the ground to bleed, and the voice of the dead Polydorus warns him to leave. The spears which impaled Polydorus have been magically transformed into the myrtle which marks his grave.

====Afghan Tradition====
In Afghan and Persian (Iranian) traditions, the myrtle leaves are used to avoid evil eyes. The leaves (preferably dry ones) are set on fire, fumigated and smoke is acquired like the same what is believed about Peganum harmala. In Afghanistan  it&#x27;s named &quot;ماڼو&quot; (māṇo). 

====Jewish====
In Jewish liturgy, the myrtle is one of the four species (sacred plants) of Sukkot, representing the different types of personality making up the community. The myrtle having fragrance but not pleasant taste, represents those who have good deeds to their credit despite not having knowledge from Torah study. The three branches are lashed or braided together by the worshipers a palm leaf, a willow bough, and a myrtle branch. The etrog or citron is the fruit held in the other hand as part of the lulav wave ritual. 

Myrtle branches were sometimes given the bridegroom as he entered the nuptial chamber after a wedding (Tos. Sotah 15:8; Ketubot 17a). Myrtles are both the symbol and scent of the Garden of Eden (BhM II: 52; Sefer ha-Hezyonot 17). The Hekhalot text the &quot;Merkavah Rabbah&quot; requires one to suck on a myrtle leaves as an element of a theurgic ritual. Kabbalists link myrtle to the sefira of Tiferet and use sprigs in their Shabbat (especially Havdalah) rites to draw down its harmonizing power as the week is initiated (Shab. 33a; Zohar Chadash, SoS, 64d; Sha’ar ha-Kavvanot, 2, pp. 73–76).

Myrtle leaves were added to the water in the last (seventh) rinsing of the head in the traditional Sephardic tahara manual (teaching the ritual for washing the dead). Myrtles are often used to recite a blessing over a fragrant plant during the Havdalah ceremony, as well as before kiddush is some Sefardic and Hasidic traditions.

====Mandaean====
In the Mandaean religion, myrtle wreaths (&quot;klila&quot;) are used by priests in important religious rituals and ceremonies, such as baptism and death masses (&quot;masiqta&quot;). Myrtle wreaths also form part of the &quot;darfash&quot;, the official symbol of Mandaeism consisting of an olive wooden cross covered with a white silk cloth.

====Contemporary====
In neo-pagan and wicca rituals, myrtle, though not indigenous beyond the Mediterranean Basin, is now commonly associated with and sacred to Beltane (May Day).

Myrtle in a wedding bouquet is a general European custom.

A sprig of myrtle from Queen Victoria&#x27;s wedding bouquet was planted as a slip, and sprigs from it have continually been included in royal wedding bouquets.

==Garden history==
===Rome===
Because of its elegance of habit, appealing odour, and amenity to clipping by the &quot;topiarius&quot;, as much as for sacred associations, the myrtle was an indispensable feature of Roman gardens. As a reminder of home, it will have been introduced wherever Roman elites were settled, even in areas of the Mediterranean Basin where it was not already endemic: &quot;the Romans... must surely have attempted to establish a shrub so closely associated with their mythology and tradition,&quot; observes Alice Coats. In Gaul and Britannia it will not have proved hardy.

===England===
In England it was reintroduced in the 16th century, traditionally with the return from Spain in 1585 of Sir Walter Raleigh, who also brought with him the first orange trees seen in England. &quot;Myrtus communis&quot; will have needed similar protection from winter cold and wet. Alice Coats notes an earlier testimony: in 1562, Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s great minister Lord Burghley wrote to Mr Windebank in Paris to ask him for a lemon, a pomegranate and a myrtle, with instructions for their culture—which suggests that the myrtle, like the others, was not yet familiar.

By 1597, John Gerard lists six varieties being grown in southern England, and by 1640 John Parkinson noted a double-flowering one. Alice Coats suggests that this was the very same double that the diarist and gardener John Evelyn noted &quot;was first discovered by the incomparable Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, which a mule had cropt from a wild shrub.&quot;

In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, myrtles in cases, pots and tubs were brought out to summer in the garden and wintered with other tender greens in an orangery. Fairchild, &quot;The City Gardener&quot; (1722) notes their temporary use, rented from a nurseryman annually to fill an empty fireplace in the warm months.

With the influx to England of more dramatic tender plants and shrubs from Japan or Peru in the 19th century, it was more difficult to find room for the common myrtle of borderline hardiness.

==Related plants==
Many other related plants native to South America, New Zealand and elsewhere, previously classified in a wider interpretation of the genus &quot;Myrtus&quot;, are now species within other genera, including: &quot;Eugenia, Lophomyrtus, Luma, Rhodomyrtus, Syzygium, Ugni&quot;, and at least a dozen other genera.

The name &quot;myrtle&quot; is also used in common names (vernacular names) of unrelated plants in several other genera, such as: &quot;Crepe myrtle&quot; (&quot;Lagerstroemia&quot; species and hybrids, Lythraceae); &quot;Wax myrtle&quot; (&quot;Morella&quot; species, Myricaceae); and &quot;Creeping myrtle&quot; (&quot;Vinca&quot; species, Apocynaceae).

<doc id="466552" wikidata="Q1277310" url="?curid=466552" title="Earl of Iveagh">
<text>Earl of Iveagh (pronounced —especially in Dublin—or ) is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, created in 1919 for the businessman and philanthropist Edward Guinness, 1st Viscount Iveagh. He was the third son of Sir Benjamin Guinness, 1st Baronet, of Ashford, and the great-grandson of Arthur Guinness, the founder of the Guinness brewery.

Guinness had already been created a baronet, of Castle Knock in the County of Dublin, in 1885. He was subsequently made Baron Iveagh, of Iveagh in the County of Down, in 1891, then Viscount Iveagh, of Iveagh in the County of Down, in 1905, and was made Viscount Elveden, of Elveden in the County of Suffolk, at the same time that he was given the earldom in 1919. All titles are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

As of 2015, the titles are held by his great-great-grandson, the fourth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1992.

The Conservative politician Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne, was the third son of the first Earl.

The family seat is Elveden Hall, near Elveden, Suffolk, formerly residence of Duleep Singh, the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, purchased by the first earl in 1894.

==Earls of Iveagh (1919)==
The heir apparent is the current Earl&#x27;s son, Arthur Guinness, Viscount Elveden.

<doc id="466554" wikidata="Q1472951" url="?curid=466554" title="Governor-General of Jamaica">
<text>The governor-general of Jamaica () is the representative of the Jamaican monarch, currently King Charles III, in Jamaica. The governor-general is appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister of Jamaica. The functions of the governor-general include appointing ministers, judges, and ambassadors; giving royal assent to legislation passed by parliament; issuing writs for election.

In general, the governor-general observes the conventions of the Westminster system and responsible government, maintaining political neutrality, and has to always act only on the advice of the prime minister. The governor-general also has a ceremonial role: hosting events at the official residenceKing&#x27;s House in the capital, Kingstonand bestowing honours to individuals and groups who are contributing to Jamaica and to their communities. When travelling abroad, the governor-general is seen as the representative of Jamaica and its monarch.

Governors-general formally serve &quot;at the monarch&#x27;s pleasure&quot;. Since 26 February 2009, the governor-general has been Sir Patrick Allen.

The office of the governor-general was created on 6 August 1962, when Jamaica gained independence from the United Kingdom as a sovereign state and an independent constitutional monarchy. Since then, six individuals have served as governor-general.

==Appointment==
The governor-general is formally appointed by the monarch of Jamaica. When a new governor-general is to be appointed, the prime minister recommends a name to the monarch, who by convention accepts that recommendation. At the installation ceremony, the new governor-general takes an oath of allegiance and an oath for the due execution of the office of governor-general.

Upon the installation, the new governor-general is invested with the insignia of the Order of the Nation by the Chief Justice of Jamaica.

==Functions==

Jamaica shares the person of the sovereign equally with 14 other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations. As the sovereign works and resides predominantly outside of Jamaican borders, the governor-general&#x27;s primary task is to perform the monarch&#x27;s constitutional duties on his or her behalf. As such, the governor-general carries out his or her functions in the government of Jamaica on behalf and in the name of the Sovereign.

The governor-general&#x27;s powers and duties are derived from Section 27 to 33 of the constitution, which set out certain provisions relating to the governor-general.

===Constitutional role===

The constitution gives the governor-general the authority to name the date of a general election, to appoint Ministers and assign them responsibilities to appoint Parliamentary Secretaries, the Attorney General, senators, privy councilors, the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal, the Director of Public Prosecutions and members of the Services Commissions. In most cases the governor-general acts in accordance with the advice of the prime minister, in some cases also after consultation with the leader of the opposition and in other cases in the recommendation of such authorities as the Services Commissions and the Privy Council.

The constitutional responsibilities of the governor-general also include exercising executive authority, granting the prerogative of mercy, giving royal assent to bills, and appointing members of Service Commissions issuing Proclamations for the proroguing and summoning of Parliament, and declaring States of Emergency.

After an election, it is the governor-general who formally requests the leader of the political party which gains the support of a majority in parliament to form a government. The governor-general commissions the prime minister and appoints other ministers after the election.

The governor-general holds regular meetings with the prime minister, and where necessary with members of the Cabinet and the leader of the opposition.

The governor-general may, in certain circumstances, exercise without—or contrary to—ministerial advice. These are known as the reserve powers.

===Ceremonial role===

The governor-general&#x27;s ceremonial duties include opening new sessions of parliament by delivering the Speech from the Throne, welcoming visiting heads of state, and receiving the credentials of foreign diplomats.

The governor-general also confers honours and awards to Jamaicans for notable service to the community, or for acts of bravery in a specially convened ceremony at King&#x27;s House on National Heroes Day.

The governor-general also attends Independence Day celebrations and the Annual Armed Forces Day Parade, and participates in wreath-laying ceremonies on National Heroes Day and Remembrance Day.

===Community role===

The governor-general provides non-partisan leadership in the community, and attends various cultural, educational and charitable events of national and local importance.

The governor-general serves as patron of the St. John Ambulance in Jamaica. He is also patron of several other organizations such as the Jamaica Agricultural Society, the Jamaica Cancer Society and the National Road Safety Council. He is also an honorary member of the principal service clubs and is the Chief Scout of Jamaica. The governor-general is also the visitor for the University of Technology.

The governor-general also conducts annual parish tours, to interact with the people, and understand the issues of interest to the Jamaican people.

==Privy Council==

The Privy Council of Jamaica consists of six members who are appointed by the governor-general, after consultation with the prime minister. The governor-general chairs meetings of the Privy Council which advises him on the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy and the discipline of the civil service, local government officers, and the police, in cases where appeals are made.

==Role in the parishes==

The Governor-General is represented in each parish by a &quot;Custos Rotulorum&quot;. The Custos is appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the prime minister and is a resident of the parish to which he/she is appointed, except in the case of the Corporate Area.

The roles of the Custodes include receiving officials and dignitaries on an official visit in the absence of the governor-general, and receiving the governor-general when he pays official visits to the parish. The Custos also acts as the Chief Magistrate of the parish, and meets the Judge of the Circuit Court at the Court House at the opening session.

<text>Benet Academy ( ) is a private, highly competitive, co-educational, college-preparatory, Benedictine high school in Lisle, Illinois, United States, overseen by the Diocese of Joliet. Founded in 1886, the school was initially established in Chicago as the all-boys St. Procopius College and Academy by Benedictine monks, who also operated the St. Joseph Bohemian Orphanage. In 1898, the orphanage moved to Lisle, about west of Chicago, to be joined by St. Procopius three years later. In 1926, Benedictine nuns constructed the all-girls Sacred Heart Academy near the orphanage and school in Lisle. The orphanage closed in 1956 to make room for St. Procopius Academy, which separated from the college in 1969. Due to rising costs and waning enrollment, Sacred Heart merged with St. Procopius Academy in 1967 to form Benet Academy on the St. Procopius campus. Since then, numerous building projects have been undertaken to expand Benet&#x27;s athletics, music, and science programs.

Admission is competitive and relies on entrance exam scores, transcripts, and performance on standardized tests. All students complete a college-preparatory curriculum and may earn college credit through programs including Advanced Placement. As of 2023, Benet&#x27;s average ACT test score regularly exceeds state and national averages, and more than 99 percent of students go on to college after graduation. The school&#x27;s academic program has been featured in reports by the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

Notable alumni of the school include Bishop Robert Barron, NBA player Frank Kaminsky, Jim Ryan, and Grammy-winning singer Dave Bickler.

==History==

===Founding in Chicago===

In the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire, Chicago&#x27;s working-class Pilsen neighborhood, a predominantly Czech enclave, expanded quickly. To serve this growing ethnic population, St. Procopius parish was founded in the summer of 1875, near the intersection of 18th and Allport Streets. The parish was named for Saint Procopius of Sázava, who founded a monastery in Bohemia in the eleventh century and became the first saint from Czechoslovakia. Vilém Čoka served as the first pastor. Planning to build a school, Čoka left it to the community to decide if the school would be secular or Catholic. They chose a Catholic school, despite the fact that only 25 percent of Pilsen&#x27;s Czech population was Catholic. As the parish outgrew his capacity to serve them, Čoka turned for help to the Order of St. Benedict.

Rev. John Nepomucene Jaeger, the first Bohemian abbot in the United States, was urged to establish a monastic community to teach at parochial schools in Bohemian as well as English. He founded St. Procopius priory in 1885. The priory took control of St. Procopius parish in January 1886, and Jaeger became the pastor. Jaeger also founded a convent in 1895, consisting of nuns brought from St. Mary&#x27;s Convent in Pittsburgh and headed by Jaeger&#x27;s biological sister, Mother Mary Nepomucene Jaeger. The Czech-American media had pushed for a convent to prepare Czech-speaking nuns for teaching positions in Czech parochial schools, which had previously hired mostly lay teachers trained in Austrian normal schools. The nuns were transferred from Pittsburgh to St. Scholastica&#x27;s Convent on Chicago&#x27;s north side, but later that same year moved to an old parish building at Ashland and 19th Streets, where they would remain until 1912. A section of the convent was converted into a music school. Graduates taught in parishes throughout the nation.

The priory was elevated to the status of abbey by Pope Leo XIII in 1894, and the monks founded a school for lay monks to help build a self-sustaining source of revenue. Failing to attract a single prospective applicant in over seven years, they expanded enrollment to students with no intention of joining the clergy. The two groups would eventually be taught separately, and the monastic students were trained to become priests fluent in Bohemian, German, and English and prepared to preach to ethnically diverse congregations. Lay students were trained for employment in the business world.

In 1900, Chicago had one of the largest Czech populations of any city in the world, with approximately 75,000–100,000 Czechs living in the city&#x27;s 10 Czech communities. Some 50,000 Czech immigrants were served by the three Czech parishes of Chicago—16,000 to 20,000 of them by St. Procopius. These Czech immigrants wanted to assimilate into American society, but also wanted to pass their language on to their children. The abbey established St. Procopius College and Academy in 1887 as a school that taught men of Czech and Slovak descent. It became the first Czech institution of higher learning in the nation, and in 1920 it remained the only Czech college. Rev. Procopius Neuzil was named the first teacher and director. Classes began on March 2, 1887, when Neuzil taught a remedial course to two students in two small rooms at 704 Allport Street. Enrollment grew to 20 within the week, taught by three instructors during the four-month term. The first full year of classes began in the fall of 1887. The college was chartered by the State of Illinois in 1890; only a two-year high school program was offered at the time. In 1893 the college published its first catalog, which urged Czech parents to enroll their 13-year-old boys. The academic curriculum included a preparatory year to teach elementary school subjects to remedial students. The two high school years were referred to as &quot;Latin years&quot;, and included required courses in Czech, English, Latin, math, orthography, history, and religion; optional courses included German and bookkeeping. Following the Latin years, students were enrolled in the business course, which included math, bookkeeping, economics, composition, history, oratory, and religion.

===Orphanage===

The Benet Academy campus in Lisle began as an orphanage. On March 14, 1899, the abbey founded St. Joseph&#x27;s Orphanage on a farm in Lisle purchased from one Serafin Rott, and transferred 10 Czech orphans there from St. Hedwig&#x27;s Polish Orphanage, which charged the parishes more for housing non-Polish orphans. It opened under the supervision of the Sisters of St. Benedict. Abbot Jaeger allowed the orphanage to use the land for free until more satisfactory housing could be constructed. The orphanage lacked stoves, fuel, adequate bedding, decent food, and any stable source of income. Neuzil, then editor-in-chief of the Czech Benedictine Press, raised $80,000 within 12 years from the generally impoverished Czech immigrant community through local publications. A new building was commissioned in 1899 to accommodate the increasing number of applicants for admission, including orphans from out-of-state. The new building was dedicated on July 2, 1900, at the same time as the cornerstone was laid for St. Procopius College, about away.

Due to increasing applications for admission, still more space was required, and William Schwartz sold the abbey of land in Lisle. On July 16, 1911, a new building was dedicated on the grounds of what is now Benet Academy, the same day the cornerstone was laid for the nearby Sacred Heart Convent. A girls&#x27; dormitory building was built in 1923. It was later converted into classrooms and renamed Benet Hall). A power plant, a larger chapel, and additional classrooms were dedicated in 1926. A gym was built in 1936; at that time the facility housed approximately 400 orphans. Twenty-three headstones from that period can be found in a small cemetery on the northwest side of the school, where orphans as young as three, one of the workmen, and several former orphans who had been raised at St. Joseph are buried. According to school lore, ghosts of orphans still haunt the fourth floor of St. Joseph Hall and the basement of Benet Hall, where the nursery of the orphanage once was.

Elementary schooling at the orphanage featured better equipped classrooms than the original building. A few years after operations moved in 1911, the school offered a two-year business program. By 1948 the orphanage comprised the Lisle Manual Training School for Boys and the Lisle Industrial School for Girls, both of which were managed by the Sisters of St. Benedict and run by the Archdiocese of Chicago. In the 1950s Petru Hall was built as an annex on the east side of the dormitory building.

The archdiocese assumed control of the orphanage in 1920, and began accepting orphans from the Juvenile Court of Cook County, most of whom came from broken homes whose parents did not pay the fines imposed by the court. This discouraged donations and strained the orphanage financially. Archbishop Samuel Cardinal Stritch, discovering that only 12 of the 255 children were actually orphans and only five of them were Slavs, closed the orphanage in 1956. The 12 true orphans were moved to Holy Angels Orphanage in Des Plaines. Bishop of Joliet Martin Dewey McNamara gave the former orphanage buildings to St. Procopius Academy, which was at that time still combined with the college.

===College in Lisle===

As enrollment increased to 46 in 1891, it became obvious that St. Procopius College&#x27;s enrollment would soon outstrip its facilities in Pilsen. Neuzil was replaced as rector by Rev. Ildephonse Wittman, also a Benedictine, in 1894. In 1896, the Abbey bought a farm in Lisle from Morris Neff to provide more space and a &quot;better atmosphere&quot;. On March 12, 1900, a new building was approved, to be built at the southwest corner of Maple and College Avenues. The groundbreaking was held on April 19, 1900, the school moved in May, and the new facility was dedicated on July 1, 1901, by Peter Muldoon, Bishop of the Diocese of Chicago. Classes began in September with six faculty and 11 students. Atheists in Chicago vehemently objected to the Catholic church-run school, but the Czech community came to the school&#x27;s defense. Limited financial aid for the generally poor Czech immigrants led to meager enrollment. Attendance grew from 13 in 1901 to 100 in 1908.

The academy offered its first four-year high school program in 1904, with both &quot;classical&quot;, or college-preparatory, and &quot;commercial&quot;, or vocational, programs. Students enrolled in the commercial track studied for three years, the first two being identical to the classical track and the third consisting of specialized coursework. The commercial program was dropped in 1915. Tuition for a semester cost $80; it was increased to $100 in 1909. As of 1921, the school enrolled only men of Bohemian or Slovak ancestry.

Income and enrollment fell during the Great Depression. Between 1917 and 1930, enrollment fell from 205 students to 140. The school sought accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, but the application was denied because the college and academy could not be accredited as a single institution, and financial constraints prevented their separation. In 1932 the abbey and the school lost most of their money when the Kaspar American Bank in Chicago failed. Academic programs and student activities were not greatly affected, in part because the faculty was mainly clergymen, who were not highly paid. Still unaccredited, the school was certified by the state of Illinois in September 1934.

Students, faculty, and clergymen sustained themselves with food produced on the Abbey Farm, which they maintained until the 1970s. Approximately 1,500 chickens provided eggs, while Brown Swiss cattle provided milk. Meat came from the farm&#x27;s supply of bulls, hogs, and heifers. Bee hives produced honey and wax, while a cannery produced more than of food products.

World War II caused enrollment to decline and the student body consisted mainly of high school students and seminarians. Following the war, new students enrolled, and the school built a temporary facility in 1947 to accommodate them. Students from Illinois began to replace out-of-state students, the percentage of day, or commuting, students rose, and the school employed more lay teachers. After the war, the previously ethnic Czech college acquired a more diverse student body, due to rising enrollment caused by the G.I. Bill. By 1947 the high school enrolled 30 students. Better times and higher birth rates led to growing enrollment at St. Procopius in the 1950s and 1960s.

With the gift of the former orphanage facility, the academy began to operate independently from the college in 1957. It was accredited on March 28, 1958. St. Procopius College was renamed Illinois Benedictine College in 1971, and Benedictine University in 1996. Under the leadership of its first principal, Rev. Thomas J. Havlik, the academy added new classrooms and St. Martin Hall to its facilities.

===Convent in Lisle===

By 1912, the community of nuns had outgrown their convent in Chicago, and relocated to the new Convent of the Sacred Heart in Lisle. They had prospered there as a teaching order educating Slovak-speaking nuns and organized two Slovak schools. In 1926, under the leadership of Mother Mary Genevieve, the convent founded a day and boarding high school for girls—the Sacred Heart Academy. The academy outgrew its space and in 1929 the convent was expanded to accommodate rising enrollment. The annexed facilities reserved for the school included a Renaissance-style chapel, an auditorium, and a gymnasium. The academy was later expanded to include the Jaeger Junior College.

The academy was primarily a boarding school. Students came from Illinois, the surrounding states, Texas, and Mexico. A few day students came from the Lisle area. In 1947 enrollment averaged 75 students. Enrollment grew from 120 in 1953 to 300 in 1958, and remained at that level until 1966. Day student enrollment also grew and in 1962 the academy stopped accepting boarding school students. By 1964, the last year in which boarding school students were enrolled, alumni had hailed from all US states, South America, France, Mexico, and Guam. Day students from 1964 to 1968 came from Lisle and the neighboring communities. Unlike St. Procopius Academy, Sacred Heart Academy offered a business curriculum from 1953 to 1966. Courses included shorthand, typewriting, and bookkeeping.

The students and nuns were supplied with food by the convent&#x27;s Benedale Farm. Cattle provided both dairy products and meat, while poultry provided eggs and their feathers were used to stuff pillows as another source of income. The nuns also raised rabbits and bees, and grew grain, hay, vegetables, grapes, and apples. The farm was closed in the late 1950s for financial reasons and the convent sold most of the land so a school could be built for the growing village of Lisle.

===Merger and expansion===

In the 1960s, St. Procopius Academy faced dwindling enrollment and funding. The Benedictines threatened to close the boys&#x27; school, but were dissuaded by Abbot Daniel W. Kucera, who had graduated from St. Procopius in 1941. Under Abbot Kucera&#x27;s leadership, St. Procopius Academy and Sacred Heart Academy merged to form Benet (an anglicized form of &quot;Benedict&quot;) Academy in 1967, on the former St. Procopius campus. Enrollment in 1968 was at 875 students, including 575 boys and 300 girls. The business education program from Sacred Heart was continued at the new school; three teachers taught courses in consumer economics, typewriting, shorthand, and bookkeeping.

St. Thomas Hall, funded by a private donor, was erected to house a library and physical sciences facilities in 1975. A major construction project was launched in 1993, in response to increasing enrollment and a growing athletic program. The $5 million building plan included a new 1,800-seat gymnasium, a new boiler system and a new roof for the cafeteria and the existing gymnasium. New parking areas were planned and St. Mary&#x27;s Hall was to be demolished.

Neighborhood residents, concerned about the impact on property values, traffic, and aesthetics, opposed the project. The Lisle Village Board blocked construction, charging that Benet had not notified the local community of the pending construction, to which Benet replied that &quot;the school was there prior to the homes being constructed&quot;. The plan was approved in April, but the Board designated the entire campus a &quot;planned-unit development&quot;, requiring Board approval for all future modifications. The new facilities included zoned lighting areas, which allowed for multipurpose use for assemblies, performances, sporting events, and graduation ceremonies. Construction was completed in May 1994, and applications increased in the years that followed. The gym was later named as the St. Ronald Gymnasium to honor former principal Rev. Ronald Rigovsky.

===21st century===
In June 2000, a need for more performance space became apparent; the school&#x27;s music groups used small, crowded rehearsal rooms and drama students performed in the old chapel or across the street at Sacred Heart Monastery. Benet began construction of a new performing arts center at the east end of the campus to replace the 190-seat Assembly Hall on the third floor of St. Joseph Hall, originally a chapel for the St. Joseph Bohemian Orphanage. As part of the project, the room was converted back into a chapel, named the Chapel of St. Therese.

Petru Hall, which was used for the annual school auction after the orphans left, was demolished to make way for the new performing arts center, named St. Daniel Hall, after Abbot Daniel Kucera and Saint Daniel. Constructed of brick and pre-cast concrete, the design includes arched entrances to match the other buildings on campus. The facility features a 369-seat auditorium, an outdoor theater complex, a rehearsal room for bands and choirs, a set-construction area, and storage areas. In addition to plays and concerts, St. Daniel Hall is also used for assemblies, lectures, and masses, which had previously been held in the gymnasium.

In May 2007, the school broke ground on a new $16 million science and student activity center. The building includes extra corridors to ease hall traffic, a larger cafeteria, and additional storage space, along with four combination classrooms and laboratories for biology and earth science, three chemistry classrooms, and two chemistry labs. In 2013, the school developed the supplementary St. Scholastica campus to have space for additional student parking and new athletic facilities.

In the fall of 2015, Benet began its Building + Inspiring + Leading strategic initiative to evaluate ways to improve the student experience. This led to the construction of St. Mary Hall, which was completed in August 2020. This $10.2 million, 33,000 sq. ft. addition included multipurpose rooms for the performing arts, a new 5,100 sq. ft. Library &amp; Collaboration Center, and an outdoor space for gathering, contemplation, and prayer. The addition also included a large gallery space for academic and social events and collaborative work, classrooms, rehearsal rooms, new restrooms, and additional storage. The new space connected the existing St. Daniel and St. Thomas Halls.

In September 2021, the school became the subject of controversy when it was revealed that an offer to employ Benet alumna Amanda Kammes as a lacrosse coach was rescinded after administrators learned that Kammes was in a same-sex marriage. After a series of community protests took place, the school announced that it had re-extended its hiring offer to Kammes and that she had accepted. Shortly after this decision was announced, Austin G. Murphy, abbot of St. Procopius Abbey, released a statement saying that he was &quot;deeply troubled&quot; by the actions of Academy administrators, and that he would be &quot;taking this matter to prayer&quot; in order to discern how to proceed. On 4 January 2022, the school and St. Procopius Abbey released a joint statement announcing the termination of the governance and oversight agreement between the abbey and Benet. On 30 March 2022, the school announced that it had reached an agreement with the Diocese of Joliet&#x27;s Catholic Schools Office to &quot;collaborate to promote and enhance&quot; Benet&#x27;s college-preparatory education in the Benedictine tradition beginning 1 July 2022.

==Admissions &amp; Tuition==
Admission is competitive and primarily based on the High School Placement Test, a standardized test by Scholastic Testing Service, taken in December of applicants&#x27; eighth grade year. According to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, schools like Benet hope to accept the top 40 percent of students taking the exam. Seventh grade transcripts and a student essay are also factors in admission. In 2003–04, 900 students applied for admission, 387 were accepted, and 338 enrolled. As of the years 2013-2018 2 out of 4 students (50%) were accepted.

Preference is given to siblings of current or former Benet students. In 1993 the average admitted eighth grader scored in the 87th percentile on the placement test. Applicants without siblings at the school were admitted only with scores above the 75th percentile; applicants with siblings at Benet were admitted with scores as low as the 50th percentile on a case-by-case basis.

Tuition is $14,950 for the 2024-2025 academic year. After graduation, 99.5% of students from this school go on to attend a 4-year college. Scholarships are offered, however highly selective.

==Academics==

As of the 2024-2025 school year, students are required to complete 23.5 Carnegie units of a college-preparatory curriculum to graduate, including four units of English, two units of foreign language, three units of math, one unit of world history, one unit of US history, three units of lab science, four units of religion, 1.5 units of physical education, and four units of electives. Spanish, French, German, and Latin are offered as foreign languages. The school offers neither vocational nor remedial courses.

22 Advanced Placement courses are offered for college credit, as well as participation in the Benedictine University Future Scholars Program, which offers college-level work in multivariable calculus and finite mathematics.

The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; ranked Benet one of the top ten high schools in the Chicago area in 2003, based on graduate enrollment rates at four-year colleges and test scores over a four-year period. In 1999 Benet was also one of two high schools in DuPage County, and 100 high schools nationwide, featured as an &quot;Outstanding American High School&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The study, conducted in conjunction with the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, identified schools &quot;where students progress steadily toward high academic standards and where every student matters.&quot; Benet has credited the school&#x27;s academic success to Rev. Ronald Rigovsky, who served as principal for 23 years and as president from 1987 to 1992. During his tenure, said the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Rigovsky developed the school into &quot;one of the highest scoring and most scholastically respected high schools in the Chicago area.&quot;

Benet Academy is accredited by/associated with the AdvancED commission, the Illinois State Board of Education, the National Catholic Educational Association, Independent Schools Association of the Central States, National Honor Society of Secondary Schools, Illinois High School Association, and Benedictine University
=== Scholars Program ===
In 2023, the Benet Academy Scholars Program was founded to recognize and provide high-achieving students with academic enrichment opportunities. Only 7.7% of students were selected to join this incredibly selective program. Members must maintain high GPAs, take advanced classes, and fulfill a large service hour requirement to remain in the program. Scholars take part in many events throughout the year, including attending the Harvard Model Congress in Boston, visiting research laboratories, and participating in advisory councils for state lawmakers. Many extremely successful speakers are welcomed to address scholars each year. The program is currently led by Executive Directors Michael Francis and Nick Derbis.

==Students and faculty==

Benet enrolled 1,333 students in 2023–24. Most students come from Catholic families with professional and college-educated parents. In 2003–04, 97 percent of students were Roman Catholic; two percent received financial aid, which totaled $3,000. Tuition was $6,000. The average class size was 27 students. Most students come from Lisle, Downers Grove, and Naperville, but students in the class of 2023 came from 85+ different area schools.

The Benet graduating class of 2020 achieved an average composite score of 30.0 (above the 92nd percentile) on the ACT, a standardized college admission test, which was the seventh straight year average score topped 28, compared to a statewide average of 24.7 and national average of 20.6. In 2000, Benet outscored all DuPage County high schools, which then-Principal Ernest Stark attributed to its closed campus policy, silent study halls, and &quot;more focused&quot; and &quot;not very fancy&quot; curriculum. In 1993, Benet&#x27;s average ACT score exceeded those of 195 public high schools in northern Illinois, second only to the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, a selective residential school for gifted students.

In 2023, Benet had five National Merit Finalists and 17 National Merit Commended Scholars in the National Merit Scholarship Program and 115 students were named Illinois State Scholars, an honor awarded to top ten percent of seniors in the state and based on test scores, class rank, or both.

In 2023, 457 students took a total of 774 Advanced Placement exams and 79 percent of them scored at least a three out of five. 43 National AP Scholar with Distinction awards were granted to students who averaged at least 3.5 on all exams taken and scored at least a 3 on five or more exams, 21 AP Scholar with Honor awards were granted to students who scored at least a 3.25 on all exams taken and scored at least a 3 on four or more exams, and 50 AP Scholar awards were granted to students who scored at least a 3 on three or more exams. Benet does not report class rankings.

More than 99 percent of Benet graduates go to college; roughly 1 percent serve in the military. A total of $71 million in scholarships was offered to the class of 2023.

Benet students were implicated in the University of Illinois clout scandal, in which some applicants were given preferential admission to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) despite having sub-par qualifications. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, investigating the scandal, reported that a majority of students who were admitted to UIUC through political favors came from elite, affluent high schools such as Benet, where families were politically connected with elected officials and university trustees. An email between admissions officers revealed that a female Benet student was admitted to the university&#x27;s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, despite the fact that she had ranked lower than 27 of her classmates who were put on a waiting list or denied admission. Between 2005 and 2009, thirteen applicants from Benet were alleged to have had political connections; eight of them were admitted to UIUC.

In 2024 Benet employed 80 faculty. The average tenure was 17 years. 25 current or former faculty members served for 25 years or more.

==Activities==

===Sports===

The St. Procopius Academy football team played its first game against Downers Grove High School on Thanksgiving Day, 1917. At first some faculty members did not approve of American football, but it became respected on campus in the 1920s under the direction of Rev. Benedict Bauer. Bauer served as Athletic Director until 1927 while also coaching basketball, baseball, and football, and planned the construction of a new gymnasium in 1925. The college&#x27;s varsity baseball team won conference championships in 1924 and 1925, and the football team defeated the University of Notre Dame freshman team in 1925.

Benet competes in the East Suburban Catholic Conference (ESCC), part of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). The school sponsors teams, named the Benet Academy Redwings, for men and women in basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, volleyball, and bass fishing. Only men compete in baseball, football, and ice hockey. Only women compete in cheerleading and softball. Since 1978, Benet has placed in the top four at least once in state tournaments in basketball, cross country, football, soccer, and tennis. In 2000-01 and 2001-02 seasons the boys&#x27; soccer team were state champions, and in 2000 they were ranked 11th in the nation. In 2008–09, the girls&#x27; volleyball team finished second in the state.From 2021-2024, the girls&#x27; volleyball team finished second in the state consecutively. In the 2024 season, the girls&#x27; volleyball team featured 11 athletes committed to Division 1 schools.In November 2010 six student-athletes signed letters of intent to play at NCAA Division I universities. The school&#x27;s boys&#x27; basketball team was also ranked sixth in the nation in February 2011 by &quot;USA Today&quot;. In 2014 the basketball team finished second in state. The boys basketball team finished second in state again in 2023. The girls soccer team finished second in state in 2023.

Benet&#x27;s boys&#x27; basketball team has set several state records, including a 102 home-game winning streak between November 26, 1975, and January 24, 1987. The streak ended when Benet lost to Naperville North High School, 47–46. The team compiled a 96 game in-conference winning streak from January 21, 1977, to February 24, 1984. The team recorded twelve consecutive seasons with at least 20 wins from 1975 to 1987, tied for the ninth longest streak in state history. The basketball team honors these school records by playing one home game each year in the Alumni Gym, where the streaks were recorded.

Benet&#x27;s chess team, founded in 2012, has won every Far Side Suburban Chess Conference championship since the team&#x27;s inception. In 2014 the chess team took second place at the IHSA state tournament.

===Performing arts===

The theater department has staged annual musicals since 1997. Shows have included &quot;42nd Street&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;Hello, Dolly!, and Pippin.&quot; In 2000, the department began depicting works that were &quot;not quite so fluffy and light&quot;, including &quot;Children of Eden&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, and &quot;Into the Woods&quot;. In 2006, the department celebrated its tenth anniversary of musical performances with a production of &quot;The Music Man&quot;.

Benet&#x27;s band program, practically nonexistent in the late 1950s, was revitalized by director Andy Marchese in the mid-1960s, who introduced new uniforms, regularly scheduled concerts, and marching band trophies. Participation in the marching band also increased after the school became coeducational, since there were more musicians willing to play instruments male students saw as feminine. Out of 1,275 students at Benet in 1999–00, 130 were choir students and 115 were band students. Instrumental groups include two concert bands, a percussion ensemble, three jazz bands, a marching band, a pep band, and a string orchestra. In 1998 the pep band was one of eight schools chosen from a pool of 58 to perform at the state basketball tournament. In 2002, the school&#x27;s symphonic band was one of three high school bands invited to play at the Illinois Music Educators Association All-State Conference in Peoria. Vocal music groups include five choirs, one of which is a student-led mass choir that participates in school liturgies.

===Student organizations===

Student clubs and organizations include the National Honor Society and Model United Nations, and a Campus Ministry geared towards fostering the students&#x27; Catholic faith. Campus Ministry assists in coordinating several three-day retreats held throughout the year, through which students are encouraged to reexamine their faith. Club activities include L.I.F.T. (Living In Faith and Truth) Benet’s Campus Ministry and service organization, Medical Club, and foreign language clubs. Student Government, in addition to coordinating the Christmas Drive, organizes student activities like prom, film festivals, and male beauty contests.

Benet&#x27;s Math Team finished in the top ten of its division each year from 2004 through 2015 in the state math competition sponsored by the Illinois Council of Teachers of Mathematics, coming in first in 2005 and 2012. Benet&#x27;s Science Olympiad team won second place in its division at the state tournaments in 2008 and 2010. In February 2010, the Law Club participated in its first mock trial, sponsored by the Illinois State Bar Association, which is expected to become an annual event.

===Christmas Drive===
The annual Christmas Drive takes place in December, during the two weeks prior to Christmas vacation. The fundraiser is a school-wide effort, jointly coordinated by Student Government, National Honor Society, and LIFT, Benet’s Campus Ministry. The fundraising efforts are varied and creative; boys donate money to remain unshaven (a violation of school policy), the National Honor Society sells baked goods, the Mother&#x27;s Club serves breakfast, and each class competes to gather the most pennies in the school-wide &quot;penny wars.&quot; The Christmas Drive was featured in the cover story of the December 2010 issue of &quot;Christ is our Hope&quot;, the official magazine of the Diocese of Joliet. In the previous year the school had raised $54,500. The money was used to support a mission trip in Appalachia, and also to provide food, school supplies, blankets, and gifts to local families in the Chicago area. In 2022, the student body raised $101,336.

<text>Folk memory, also known as folklore or myths, refers to past events that have been passed orally from generation to generation. The events described by the memories may date back hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of years and often have a local significance. They may explain physical features in the local environment, provide reasons for cultural traditions or give etymologies for the names of local places.

==Purported folk memories==
===Events===
* Landing at Cape York by Willem Janszoon, the first European to see the coast of Australia, 1606.
* Myths from Native American and First nations groups about the 1700 Cascadia earthquake.
* The Origin of Fire in the Finnish national epic &quot;Kalevala&quot;, possibly originating to the meteorite impact resulting in Kaali crater in Estonia 4,000 – 7,600 years ago.
* Various Great Flood myths, possibly reflecting a flooding of the Black Sea basin c. 5600 BCE
* The Klamath Native American myth concerning the eruption of Mount Mazama c. 5700 BCE
===Species===
* Māori legends of a man-eating bird, known variously as the Pouākai, Hokioi, or Hakawai are commonly believed to recount Haast&#x27;s eagle, a giant predatory bird that became extinct with the moa only 600 years ago. Opposing claims have been made that associate the Hokioi and Hakawai with the extirpated Coenocorypha snipe.
* Mapinguari legends of a giant sloth-like creature that corresponds with the Megatherium, which has been extinct for 10,000 years.
* Legends of the bunyip within Australian Aboriginal mythology have been associated with extinct marsupial megafauna such as &quot;Zygomaturus&quot; or &quot;Palorchestes&quot;. When shown fossil remains, some Aboriginal peoples identified them as those of the bunyip.
* Descriptions of the&quot; mihirung paringmal&quot; among Western Victorian Aboriginal peoples correspond to the extinct giant birds the Dromornithidae.
* A Noongar Aboriginal story from Perth, Western Australia, has been interpreted as referring to the extinct giant monitor lizard Megalania.
* Legends throughout Eurasia describing creatures such as the unicorn may have been based upon Elasmotherium, a rhinoceros believed to have been extinct for up to 50,000 years.
* The Ebu Gogo myths of the people of Flores have been hypothesised to represent &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;, which perhaps became extinct around 10,000 BCE (although the Flores Islanders hold that the Ebu Gogo remained alive 400 years ago).
* An Inuit string figure representing a large creature is identified with the extinct woolly mammoth
* Legends from dozens of Native American tribes have been interpreted by some as indicative of Woolly Mammoth. One example is from the Kaska tribe from northern British Columbia; in 1917 an ethnologist recorded their tradition of: “A very large kind of animal which roamed the country a long time ago. It corresponded somewhat to white men&#x27;s pictures of elephants. It was of huge size, in build like an elephant, had tusks, and was hairy. These animals were seen not so very long ago, it is said, generally singly, but none have been seen now for several generations. Indians come across their bones occasionally. The narrator said he and some others, a few years ago, came on a shoulder-blade... as wide as a table (about three feet).” However, the animal in this story was predatory and carnivorous, suggesting the memory of the proboscideans had become conflated with that of other megafauna, such as bears and sabertooths.
Even more so than is ordinary for the study of history, the plausible historical connections listed above could be inaccurate due to the difficulty of piecing together prehistoric or preliterate fragments of evidence into a meaningful understanding. They must rely on more speculation to fill in evidence gaps than would be acceptable in another context that provided more rigorous verifiability of the records available.

<text>The prime minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis is the head of government of the Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis. The current Prime Minister is Terrance Drew since 6 August 2022.

==Constitutional basis==
The office of prime minister is established by section 52 of the constitution of Saint Kitts and Nevis, which provides that the governor-general must appoint the Representative in the National Assembly who &quot;appears to him or her likely to command the support of the majority of the Representatives&quot;.

If a no-confidence motion in the prime minister is passed by the National Assembly, the prime minister must either resign with three days or advise the governor-general to dissolve the assembly and call a general election. If this does not occur, the governor-general must remove the prime minister from office. The office of prime minister also becomes vacant if the officeholder ceases to become a member of the National Assembly (other than by dissolution of parliament).

<text>Justified is the debut solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake. It was released on November 5, 2002, by Jive Records. The album was written and recorded in a six-week period as Timberlake&#x27;s boy band NSYNC was on hiatus. For his solo album, he began to adopt a more mature image as an R&amp;B artist opposed to the previous pop music recorded by the group. The majority of the album was produced by the Neptunes (credited as &quot;Williams and Hugo&quot;) and Timbaland, and features guest appearances by Janet Jackson, Clipse, and Bubba Sparxxx. It primarily is an R&amp;B album that also contains influences of dance-pop, funk, and soul music.

&quot;Justified&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, who complimented the mature progression of Timberlake&#x27;s material, although some criticized its lyrical content. The album earned Timberlake four Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year, and won the award for Best Pop Vocal Album. &quot;Justified&quot; topped the album charts in Ireland, Scotland, and the United Kingdom while reaching the top ten in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, and the United States. As of 2012, it has sold over 10 million copies worldwide.

Four singles were released from &quot;Justified&quot;. The lead single &quot;Like I Love You&quot; peaked at number 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while the follow-up singles &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; and &quot;Rock Your Body&quot; peaked within the top five on the chart. &quot;Like I Love You&quot;, &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, and &quot;Rock Your Body&quot; peaked at number two in the United Kingdom and in the top ten in Australia (with &quot;Rock Your Body&quot; topping the Australian chart), Ireland, Netherlands, and Belgium. To promote the album, Timberlake performed on several television shows and award ceremonies, including the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, where he made his solo debut appearance. Furthermore, Timberlake embarked on two concert tours—The Justified World Tour and the Justified and Stripped Tour—with Christina Aguilera accompanying him on the latter.

==Background==
Following the conclusion of their Celebrity Tour in April 2002, boy band NSYNC went on a hiatus, during which co-lead singer Justin Timberlake continued work on what would be his debut solo album. The album was said to be &quot;more than halfway completed&quot; by early 2002. With the album, he wanted to portray a more mature image as an R&amp;B performer, rather than a boy band pop artist. He revealed minimal information regarding the producers and artists involved with &quot;Justified&quot; during its early recording stage, with his management and record label also reluctant to share any information. However, MTV News reported that production duo The Neptunes were working on multiple tracks, while rapper P. Diddy and singer Mario Winans contributed to one track. Other known producers involved included Mike City, Raphael Saadiq and Rodney Jerkins, though between June and July, none of the aforementioned producers had attended any studio sessions. Explaining his involvement with the project, Jerkins said at the 2002 BET Awards that he &quot;just got a call about working on the project&quot; and that whenever Timberlake wanted his assistance, it would &quot;be done&quot;. The majority of tracks for &quot;Justified&quot; were originally intended for Michael Jackson. Since Jackson turned down the tracks, the songs were modified for Timberlake&#x27;s album.

Brian McKnight&#x27;s manager stated that his client had already recorded tracks with the singer, while rapper Nelly explained to the reporters that both him and Timberlake had discussed a collaboration effort. Early in 2002, Angie Stone revealed that Timberlake &quot;loves the &quot;Mahogany Soul&quot; album&quot; with him further saying to her &quot;your CD&#x27;s in my car right now, you have to work on my solo project&quot;. These assertions were later partially denied by a Jive Records spokesperson who announced that the material produced from the collaboration would not appear on the finalized record.

==Recording==
&quot;Justified&quot; was written and recorded in a six-week period. According to Timberlake, the &quot;creative spurt&quot; was reminiscent of &quot;that period of time back in the 1960s and &#x27;70s when musicians got together and just jammed and worked out of inspiration. There was no heavy calculation or belaboring songs and mixes. Everything flowed pretty easily and naturally.&quot; Recording sessions took place at various studios in the United States, including the Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, Manhattan Center Studios in New York City and Master Sound Recording Studios and Windmark Recording in Virginia Beach.

The Neptunes told MTV News that the duo and Timberlake drove in a car listening to Earth, Wind &amp; Fire albums for inspiration, with the background of the band&#x27;s music being what the production duo wanted to implement into &quot;Justified&quot; musical content. The production duo commented that despite not being content with sampling music, for inspiration, they also listened to both &quot;Off the Wall&quot; (1979) and &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982), albums by Jackson. Their intentions were to create music that was similar to Jackson&#x27;s work without &quot;recycling them&quot;. One of the two members of The Neptunes, Chad Hugo, commented that they just wanted to re-create &quot;that sense of those timeless, classic songs, without any of the &#x27;bling, bling, hit me on my two-way&#x27; style of the new R&amp;B. It has elements of the old and the new.&quot; The producer further went on to say that people wanted Timberlake to be conformed to being part of boy band NSYNC, with the former insisting that the singer is an immaculate vocalist. Hugo acknowledged Timberlake&#x27;s break-up with singer Britney Spears, saying that some of the album&#x27;s music could be directed towards it.

==Music and lyrics==

The opening track on &quot;Justified&quot;, &quot;Señorita&quot; is a Spanish oriented song that features R&amp;B influences; in it Timberlake sings about a girl with brown eyes. &quot;Like I Love You&quot; is a funk influenced song consisted of live drums, tiny guitar strum accompanied with the singer&#x27;s breathy tenor. According to Ben Ratliff of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s minimalism influenced by Michael Jackson&quot;. The third track on the album, &quot;(Oh No) What You Got&quot; was described by Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine as a bit racy for the audience who expected a more boy-band-oriented record. Regarding the fourth song, Russell Bailie of &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; wrote that although the album &quot;manages to skirt teen-pop sugariness for the most part, though it does offer quality mush on numbers such as &#x27;Take It From Here&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; is a funk and R&amp;B song with an instrumentation that features beatboxing, synthesizers, Arabian-inspired riffs and Gregorian chants. Lyrically, the song is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past.
The sixth track, &quot;Rock Your Body&quot;, incorporates tinny, &quot;keyboard-set-to-emulate-clavichord&quot; synthesizers of The Neptunes&#x27; late 90s productions, overlaid with &quot;keys and a propulsive drum vamp&quot;. The seventh track of the album is &quot;Nothin&#x27; Else&quot;; which according to David Merryweather of Drowned in Sound is a &quot;slinky&quot; and &quot;smooth&quot; song that is similar to the works of American musician Stevie Wonder. Influenced by Jackson&#x27;s musical style and Van McCoy&#x27;s 1975 single &quot;The Hustle&quot;, &quot;Last Night&quot; is played with a xylophone. &quot;Still On My Brain&quot;, the ninth track on the album, is a slow jam, similar to the songs performed by Timberlake&#x27;s former band &#x27;NSYNC. &quot;(And She Said) Take Me Now&quot; which features singer Janet Jackson, is a disco, &#x27;80s funk and dub song that contains racy lyrics. Similar to the previous song, &quot;Right For Me&quot;, the eleventh track of the album has racy lyrics and features rapper Bubba Sparxxx; on it Timberlake &quot;cockily&quot; sings the line, &quot;I could think of a couple positions for you&quot;. &quot;Let&#x27;s Take a Ride&quot; is the twelfth song on the album, on which, according to &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine, Timberlake &quot;offers to deliver you from your humdrum existence&quot;. The record concludes with &quot;Never Again&quot;, a Brian McKnight produced ballad, on which Timberlake becomes &quot;downright maudlin and snippy&quot;.

==Singles==
&quot;Like I Love You&quot; featuring Clipse was released as the album&#x27;s lead single. It was released as a CD single in August 2002 in Germany and the US. The song was written by Justin Timberlake and The Neptunes, who also produced the track. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised its production and use of instrumentals. &quot;Like I Love You&quot; charted at number eleven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and in the top five in the UK, Denmark, Netherlands and Ireland. The song was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 45th Grammy Awards.

&quot;Justified&quot; second single is &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, and was released through contemporary and rhythmic radio on November 24, 2002, and as a 12&quot; vinyl on December 23 in the US. The song was written by Timberlake, Scott Storch and Timbaland and produced by the latter. &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; debuted at number 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on the issue dated December 21, 2002, and eventually peaked at number three. In other countries, the song achieved similar success, reaching number two in Australia and the UK, and the top five in several other territories. &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; has been certified gold in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of 70,000 units, and certified silver in France. It won a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 ceremony, while the accompanying music video won two MTV Video Music Awards: Best Male Video and Best Pop Video. The song is listed on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

&quot;Rock Your Body&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single, and was released on May 6, 2003, as a CD single in the US. It was written by Timberlake and The Neptunes, and produced by the latter. The song topped the charts in Australia for one week, became Timberlake&#x27;s third single to reach number two in the UK, and reached the top five in Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand and the US. &quot;Rock Your Body&quot; was certified platinum in Australia by the ARIA. It received a gold certification in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of 500,000 units.

&quot;Señorita&quot; is &quot;Justified&quot; fourth single, released through rhythmic radio on July 8, 2003. It was written by Timberlake and The Neptunes, while being produced by the latter. It reached number 27 on the Hot 100, and achieved its highest peak in Australia and New Zealand, where it reached number six and four, respectively.

==Promotion==
Timberlake performed &quot;Like I Love You&quot; at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards prior to the album&#x27;s release. The day of &quot;Justified&quot;&#x27;s release, Timberlake appeared on TRL and performed &quot;Like I Love You&quot; and &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; live in Times Square. TV specials included a sit-down interview with Barbara Walters on 20/20, an episode of MTV Launch that followed the making of &quot;Justified&quot;, and the TV concert special, &quot;Justin Timberlake: Down Home in Memphis&quot;. Timberlake performed &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; at the 13th annual &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, held on December 9, 2002, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. He was accompanied by a string section and a 20-member choir. He performed &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; on a promotional concert held at House of Blues in West Hollywood, California on June 17, 2003. On February 1, 2004, the singer performed &quot;Rock Your Body&quot; at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show with singer Janet Jackson. At the moment Timberlake sang the lyric &quot;Bet I&#x27;ll have you naked by the end of this song,&quot; he ripped off part of Jackson&#x27;s costume, momentarily exposing her right breast on live television. Timberlake distanced himself from the controversy while Jackson faced much criticism. He later commented that &quot;America&#x27;s harsher on women...[and] unfairly harsh on ethnic people.&quot; He performed &quot;Señorita&quot; live on the sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in October 2003, where he served as host and musical guest, and at the 2004 Grammy Awards. Magazine covers included &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which dubbed him the &quot;New King of Pop&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;VIBE magazine,&quot; &quot;The Advocate&quot;, and &quot;Details&quot;.

Timberlake did a joint tour in North America with Christina Aguilera entitled the Justified &amp; Stripped Tour, to support both &quot;Justified&quot; and Aguilera&#x27;s 2002 album, &quot;Stripped&quot;. Timberlake&#x27;s and Aguilera&#x27;s managers suggested to both singers to go on a conjoint tour. Timberlake agreed with the suggestion, saying that &quot;It would be fun to be on tour with somebody who&#x27;s that talented&quot;. Timberlake&#x27;s further reasoning for touring with Aguilera was due to both singers wanting to &quot;break the mold of what people look at as teen pop and move into a different direction&quot;. For the tour, Timberlake wanted to transform arenas into clubs, stating that he wants people &quot;to feel like they&#x27;re a part of the show and it&#x27;s a party&quot;, remarking that anybody caught sitting down would get booted. For the tour, Timberlake performed with eight dancers, a 14-piece band which included four backup singers, three horn players and a DJ. The tour commenced on June 4, 2003, in Phoenix, Arizona and concluded on September 2, 2003, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The tour grossed approximately $45 million.

In September 2003, McDonald&#x27;s announced Timberlake as a new spokesmen for their &quot;I&#x27;m Lovin&#x27; It&quot; campaign. Timberlake recorded &quot;I&#x27;m Lovin&#x27; It&quot;, to be featured in adverts for the franchise, later expanded and released as a single in December 2003. McDonald&#x27;s later announced they will sponsor a tour for Timberlake, following his successful North American tour with Christina Aguilera, entitled the Justified World Tour. Timberlake stated &quot;I love what McDonald&#x27;s is doing with the new &#x27;i&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it&#x27; campaign and it&#x27;s cool to be part of it [...] We share the same crowd -- people who like to have fun -- and that&#x27;s what this new partnership and my European concert tour is all about.&quot; The tour began with Timberlake playing intimate gigs at clubs and theatres in the United States and Australia before expanding to arenas in Europe. The tour commenced on May 7, 2003, in Sheffield, England and concluded on June 19, 2004, in Brisbane, Australia. Jive Records released two DVD specials for Justified, &quot;Justified: the Videos&quot; and &quot;Justin Timberlake: Live from London&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Justified&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album has received an average score of 68, based on 14 reviews. Ben Ratliff of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was receptive to The Neptunes&#x27;s production, and noted both &quot;Like I Love You&quot; and &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; as standout tracks. Ratliff also commented that Justin Timberlake has successfully &quot;vaulted over the canyon&quot; to adulthood. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; critic Sal Cinquemani believed that Timberlake meshes with The Neptunes &quot;so well he virtually relinquishes his personality to the super-duo—he could very well be the third member of N.E.R.D.&quot; Cinquemani noted the similarities between &quot;Justified&quot; tracks to the work of musician Michael Jackson, saying that the album should have been Jackson&#x27;s tenth and final studio album, &quot;Invincible&quot; (2001). BBC Music&#x27;s Denise Boyd praised &quot;Like I Love You&quot;, while also commending &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; for its lyrical content and &quot;Rock Your Body&quot;, which he notes contains Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder influences. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne wrote how the album should have been the outcome of Jackson&#x27;s tenth studio album, as &quot;the ultramodern R&amp;B-pop hybrid&quot;. Browne described &quot;Justified&quot; as &quot;cohesive&quot;, favoring the album to NSYNC&#x27;s previous two efforts: &quot;Celebrity&quot; (2001) and &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; (2000).

Robert Christgau wrote of Timberlake in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;though his talent and character were there for all to see, who knew he&#x27;d turn out this heady or beatwise?&quot; The newspaper&#x27;s Christopher O&#x27;Connor commended The Neptunes&#x27; production, while praising &quot;Like I Love You&quot; and the Janet Jackson collaboration &quot;(And She Said) Take Me Now&quot;, saying how the songs show that Timberlake &quot;has the balls to pursue the A-plus list.&quot; O&#x27;Connor showed ambivalence towards &quot;Right for Me&quot; and &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, noting the former as &quot;awkward&quot; and the latter as &quot;a lousy Aaliyah impression.&quot; Tyler Martin from &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; deemed &quot;Señorita&quot; and &quot;Like I Love You&quot; as the record&#x27;s highlights, while writing that the album does not maintain Timberlake&#x27;s masculine persona, but still &quot;paints a picture of a complicated young man, growing into adulthood&quot;.

&quot;NME&quot; Alex Needham was less enthusiastic, writing that Timberlake&#x27;s lyrics are &quot;soppy platitudes that may or may not be about Britney&quot;. Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; believed the only noticeable tracks are &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; and &quot;Rock Your Body&quot;, noting the latter as &quot;predictable&quot;, while criticising the album&#x27;s lyrics as being &quot;suggestive mumbling&quot;. Some critics accused Timberlake of borrowing inspiration too heavily from Michael Jackson&#x27;s work. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that Timberlake &quot;shamelessly borrows from Jacko, from the &quot;Thriller&quot;-era&quot;, going on to criticize his vocals as to lack substance, with his falsetto lacking character, though calling him a &quot;technically skilled vocalist.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Justified&quot; was ranked second on &quot;The Face&quot;″s &quot;Recordings of the Year&quot;, and 46 on &quot;Village Voice&quot;″s &quot;Pazz + Jop 2003&quot;. &quot;Justified&quot; was listed at number 37 on &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; Best music of the decade list. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It was also included on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s list of &quot;1000 albums to hear before you die,&quot; calling the artist &quot;the quintessential modern crossover act.&quot; In 2009 MTV Base included the album among the 100 &quot;Greatest Albums Ever&quot;, which ranked 15 after the public poll. In 2014, writers from &quot;Paste&quot; considered it the 7th best solo debut, and in 2017 from Cleveland.com, the best boy band solo debut. &quot;Justified&quot; ranked 5 on &quot;NME&quot;″s greatest debut albums turning 15 in 2017, with the author saying &quot;perhaps a few more listens would have changed NME&#x27;s mind at the time.&quot; In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it number 87 in their list of &quot;The 100 best albums of the 21st century,&quot; saying: &quot;Timberlake&#x27;s Neptunes/Timbaland-helmed debut was slick, sexy and most importantly, convincing.&quot;

==Awards==
&quot;Justified&quot; earned Timberlake three American Music Award nominations, including Favorite Pop/Rock Album, Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist and Fan Choice Award. Timberlake won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album. At the 45th Grammy Awards, Timberlake had one nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for &quot;Like I Love You&quot;. The following year, &quot;Justified&quot; earned Timberlake nominations for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, while &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. Timberlake won the latter two awards. For &quot;Justified&quot;, Timberlake won Best Male, Best Pop and Best Album at the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards. &quot;Justified&quot; won the International Album award at the 2004 Brit Awards.

At the 2003 BET Awards, he received two nominations for Best R&amp;B Male Artist and Best New Artist. Among others, it was nominated Best Album at the MOBO Award, International Album of the Year at the NRJ Music Awards, and Foreign Album of the Year at the Danish Music Awards.

==Legacy==
For a 2018 &quot;Billboard&quot; article, writers Taylor Weatherby and Nina Braca said the album &quot;may possibly be the most iconic debut album from a former band member in pop music history&quot;, describing it as &quot;[a] bona-fide success that foreshadowed Timberlake&#x27;s superstardom to come&quot; and &quot;at the same time, a declaration of independence from his poppier beginnings.&quot; From the same magazine, Dan Weiss deemed &quot;Justified&quot; as Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;classic album.&quot; Writers from &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; deemed it &quot;the standard for former teen pop stars&#x27; bids to be taken seriously&quot; when comparing it to other debut solo albums released later, and &quot;Herald Sun&quot; considered it a &quot;boy band to men blueprint.&quot; British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran cited the album as an inspiration for his 2014 single &quot;Sing&quot;, and Shawn Mendes for his 2018 song &quot;Lost in Japan&quot;. One Direction&#x27;s Liam Payne, talking about his debut solo album, stated he was focusing on making a record like &quot;Justified&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Justified&quot; debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 439,000 copies in its opening week. The album was expected to top the chart, replacing the &quot;8 Mile&quot; soundtrack (2002). Instead the soundtrack sold 507,000 copies, due to being propelled by Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;. The following week, &quot;Justified&quot; sold 188,770 copies and fell two positions to number four. In its third week, the album sold 110,000 copies and remained within the top ten on the chart. The album appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for seventy-two weeks, and eventually went on to sell 3.5 million copies in the US. It has been certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of three million copies. As of 2018, the album has accumuladed 4.6 million album-equivalent units in the US, combining sales and equivalent streams. &quot;Justified&quot; debuted and peaked at number two on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums 2003 year-end charts, reaching number eleven and twenty-six, respectively.

Internationally, &quot;Justified&quot; received a similar response. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Justified&quot; debuted at number six on the week of November 16, 2002, and eventually peaked at number one, remaining atop for seven non-consecutive weeks.

The album charted within the top thirty and forty in several other countries. As of June 2012, the album has sold over 10 million copies worldwide.

According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, as of 2022, &quot;Justified&quot; is one of the 15 best-performing 21st-century albums without any of its singles being number-one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

<text>The sponsorship scandal, AdScam or Sponsorgate, was a scandal in Canada that came as a result of a federal government &quot;sponsorship program&quot; in the province of Quebec involving the Liberal Party of Canada, which was in power from 1993 to 2006.

The program was originally established as an effort to raise awareness of the Government of Canada&#x27;s (then led by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien) contributions to Quebec industries and other activities in order to counter the actions of the Parti Québécois government of the province that worked to promote Quebec independence. The program ran from 1996 until 2004, when broad corruption was discovered in its operations and it was discontinued . Illicit and even illegal activities within the administration of the program were revealed, involving misuse and misdirection of public funds intended for government advertising in Quebec. Such misdirections included sponsorship money awarded to Liberal Party-linked ad firms in return for little or no work, in which firms maintained Liberal organizers or fundraisers on their payrolls or donated back part of the money to the Liberal Party. The resulting investigations and scandal affected the Liberal Party and the then-government of Prime Minister Paul Martin. 

Though an ongoing affair for years, it rose to national prominence in early 2004 after the program was examined by Auditor General Sheila Fraser, who found significant concerns. Her revelations led to the Martin government establishing the Gomery Commission, formally the Commission of Inquiry into the Sponsorship Program and Advertising Activities, headed by Justice John Gomery for the purpose of conducting a public inquiry and filing a report on the matter The Commission concluded that $2 million was awarded in contracts without a proper bidding system, $250,000 was added to one contract price for no additional work, and $1.5 million was awarded for work that was never done, of which $1.14 million was repaid. The Commission found that a number of rules in the &quot;Financial Administration Act&quot; were broken. The overall operating cost of the commission was $14 million.

In the national spotlight, the scandal became a significant factor in the lead-up to the 2006 federal election when, after more than 12 years in power, the Liberals were defeated by the Conservatives, who formed a minority government that was sworn in February 2006.

== Notable people involved ==

* Jean Chrétien — Prime Minister of Canada (1993-2003) at the time that the Sponsorship Program was established and operated. The Gomery Commission&#x27;s First Phase Report, which assigned blame for the Sponsorship scandal, cast most of the indemnity for misspent public funds and fraud on Chrétien and the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (PMO) staff, though it cleared Chrétien himself of direct wrongdoing. On 26 June 2008, the Federal Court quashed the Gomery Inquiry&#x27;s conclusions that Chrétien and Pelletier bore responsibility for the sponsorship scandal. This decision was later upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal.
* Chuck Guité — bureaucrat in charge of the sponsorship program, who was arrested for fraud by the RCMP and convicted on five counts on 6 June 2006.
* Jean Pelletier — Chrétien&#x27;s Chief of Staff (1990-2001; 1993-2001 for the PMO) and chairman of Via Rail (2001-2004). Guité testified that he regularly received instructions from Pelletier during his time at the PMO about what programs to spend sponsorship money on and how much, a claim that Justice Gomery found to be truthful. Via Rail was accused of mishandling sponsorship deals, though mostly not under Pelletier&#x27;s tenure.
* Alfonso Gagliano — Minister of Public Works (1997-2002) who was in charge of the program. He was also the Quebec lieutenant between 1999 and 2002, making him in charge of Liberal Party operations in Quebec.
* André Ouellet — member of Prime Minister Chrétien&#x27;s Cabinet, longtime Liberal politician and later head of Canada Post, who was also accused of violating sponsorship rules.
* Jean Carle — long-time close associate of Chrétien&#x27;s, going back to the 1980s, and generally viewed as Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;surrogate son.&quot; Carle served as the chief of operations at the PMO between 1993-1998 and as a senior executive at the Crown-owned Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) between 1998 and 2001. Guité testified that besides for Pelletier that he sometimes also received his orders from Carle during his time at the PMO. During his time at the BDC, Carle testified at the Gomery commission that he created a $125,000 phony paper trail to hide a sponsorship deal, a tactic that Gomery compared to money laundering. 
* Jean Brault — head of Groupaction Marketing, one of the companies to which deals were directed. He was arrested for fraud by the RCMP, pleading guilty to five counts of fraud and on May 5, 2006, was sentenced to 30 months in prison.
* Jacques Corriveau — Liberal organizer and head of Pluridesign to which millions in sponsorship dollars were directed.
* Paul Martin — Minister of Finance and Senior Minister from Quebec during most of the years the program occurred. Martin later became Prime Minister of Canada (2003-2006); when he became Prime Minister in December 2003, he claimed that he put a halt to it. He also set up the Gomery Commission which later cleared him of formal responsibility in the &quot;First Phase Report&quot;. The Gomery findings found that Martin, as finance minister, established a &quot;fiscal framework&quot; but he did not have oversight as to the dispersal of the funds once they were apportioned to Chrétien&#x27;s PMO. A report on the issue by the Auditor General&#x27;s Office of Sheila Fraser came to the same conclusion. Nonetheless, Martin was accused of tying Gomery&#x27;s hands and using the sponsorship scandal as an excuse to purge the Liberals of members who supported Chrétien. The scandal played a factor in the federal election of 2006 and the fall of the Liberal Government. Shortly thereafter, Martin resigned from the liberal party leadership.
* Joe Morselli — Liberal Party fundraiser. Jean Brault testified that the money exchanges were with Morselli.
* Jean Lafleur — former CEO of Lafleur Communication Marketing Inc. One of the advertising executives that accepted money from the federal government. Pleaded guilty to 28 counts of fraud.
* Allan Cutler — former civil servant and whistleblower who reported anomalies in the Canadian sponsorship program, triggering the scandal.

== Timeline of events ==

=== Prior to AG report ===
=== AG report (2004–2007) ===
== The Gomery Commission ==
The Gomery Commission, formally the Commission of Inquiry into the Sponsorship Program and Advertising Activities, was a federal commission of inquiry, with Justice John Gomery as the sole commissioner, established for the purpose of investigating the sponsorship scandal, which involved allegations of corruption within the Canadian government.

The commission was called by then-Prime Minister Paul Martin in February 2004 soon after a report by the Auditor General of Canada found unexplainable irregularities in the government&#x27;s Sponsorship Program. The Commission held public hearings from 7 September 2004 to 17 June 2005, hearing from 172 witnesses.

Gomery released his Phase I Report on the scandal on 1 November 2005 and Phase II Report on 1 February 2006.

In 2008, Federal Court of Canada Judge Max M. Teitelbaum set aside Gomery&#x27;s conclusion that Jean Chrétien and Jean Pelletier shared blame for the mismanagement of the program to boost the federal government&#x27;s profile in Quebec. Teitelbaum&#x27;s decision was appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal where it was upheld.

=== Mandate ===
The commission had a broader mandate, more power and greater resources than the Auditor General, and most importantly could look beyond government to the advertising agencies that had received the Sponsorship dollars. The terms of reference allowed the commissioner to question witnesses, hire experts and adopt any procedures or methods that he considers expedient for the proper conduct of the inquiry. The purpose given was to &quot;investigate and report on questions raised, directly or indirectly&quot; by the Auditor General&#x27;s report. However, as is typically the case in commissions of inquiry, he was specifically directed not to make any conclusions or recommendations on criminal charges or civil liability.

Commissioner Gomery was given a two part mandate with power issued to him under the &quot;Inquiries Act&quot;. The first part of the mandate was investigate and report on questions and concerns addressed in the &quot;2003 Report of the Auditor General of Canada&quot; relating to the sponsorship program and advertising activities of the Government of Canada. These concerns included the program&#x27;s creation, the selection of agencies, the program&#x27;s management and activities, the receiving and use of funds and disbursement of commissions, and anything else that Gomery feels relevant.

The second part of the mandate was for Gomery to make any recommendations that he considers advisable, based on his findings. Specifically requested of Gomery were the following: to prevent mismanagement of sponsorship or advertising programs in the future, taking into account legislation to protect &quot;whistleblowers&quot;; to recommend changes to legislation to change the governance of Crown corporations to ensure that audit committees are strengthened, that public access to information is increased, that there is a consistent application of the provisions for each organization, that compliance and enforcement be enhanced, and finally that respective responsibilities and accountabilities of Ministers and public servants as recommended by the Auditor General of Canada.

=== Proceedings and testimonies ===

The Gomery Commission began holding public hearings on 7 September 2004 in Ottawa, meeting in the Old City Hall. The first to testify was Auditor General Sheila Fraser who reported the findings of her earlier investigations. The first part of its investigation was of the political direction of the project. Most of the top officials involved were called to testify.

Testimony confirmed the Auditor General&#x27;s conclusion that advertising firms submitted invoices for work that had not been done. Witnesses also reported that companies were asked to make cash contributions to the Liberal Party of Canada&#x27;s Québec wing and to put Liberal workers on company payrolls.

In an unprecedented event, the inquiry saw the testimony of two Prime Ministers in February 2005: then-Finance Minister Paul Martin and then-Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. The latter&#x27;s testimony was much anticipated as this was the first time in over a century that a sitting Canadian prime minister testified before a public inquiry.

Chrétien defended the program as an important component of the government&#x27;s efforts to raise federal visibility in Québec. Prior to his testimony, Chrétien&#x27;s lawyers moved to expel Justice Gomery in December 2004 due to several comments he had made to a &quot;National Post&quot; reporter before the hearings that demonstrated Gomery&#x27;s bias against Chrétien. These included Gomery commenting that golf balls marked with Chrétien&#x27;s name, which had been paid for by the sponsorship program, were &quot;small town cheap.&quot; Gomery rejected the calls to recuse himself setting up a confrontation between him and Chrétien. At the end of his day of testimony Chrétien closed his statement by pulling out a series of golf balls bearing the name of American presidents and the law firm Ogilvie Renault (which at the time employed former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Gomery commission counsel Bernard Roy and Gomery&#x27;s own daughter) asking whether each of them was &quot;small town cheap.&quot; The stunt was the focus of all the media reports.

Martin appeared a few days following Chrétien, and denied any involvement in the program.

After the prime ministers testified, the hearings moved to Montreal to investigate where the money had gone. The hearings in Ottawa had uncovered little more than what was in the Auditor General&#x27;s report. The AG did not have the authority to investigate outside of the government, and the look into the advertising companies in Montreal uncovered a great deal of new and explosive allegations. The most important of these were by Groupaction executive Jean Brault who recounted a series of crimes committed to direct government money to Liberal party supporters. These caused a sharp fall in the support for the governing Liberals, and put their government in jeopardy.

=== Reports ===

==== Phase I Report ====
On 1 November 2005, Gomery released the Phase I Report. Gomery criticized Chrétien and his chief of staff Jean Pelletier but cleared them of direct involvement in kickback schemes. While people such as Alfonso Gagliano, Chuck Guité and Jacques Corriveau took advantage of the programme, Gomery argued that abuses would not have occurred had Chrétien set the programme with safeguards in place. Gomery said that Pelletier &quot;failed to take the most elementary precautions against mismanagement – and Mr. Chrétien was responsible for him.&quot;

Gomery also exonerated Prime Minister Paul Martin, the minister of finance during most of the sponsorship programme. Gomery specifically said that Martin &quot;is entitled, like other ministers from the Quebec caucus, to be exonerated from any blame for carelessness or misconduct,&quot; as the Department of Finance&#x27;s role was not oversight, but setting the &quot;fiscal framework.&quot;

==== Phase II Report ====
On 1 February 2006, Gomery released his final report consisting mostly of recommendations for changes to the civil service and its relation to government.

The recommendations suggested include:

* Moving more responsibility to Parliamentary committees
* Stiffer penalties for violation in public spending legislation
* De-politicize civil service and crown corporation appointments
* More transparency with allocation of reserve funds
* Ban on destruction of documents

Shortly after Justice Gomery held a press conference, Prime Minister-designate Stephen Harper, elected on January 23, 2006, told the press that some of the commission&#x27;s recommendations matched his proposed first bill, the &quot;Federal Accountability Act.&quot; Other recommendations went further than what Harper promised, while some other recommendations (dealing with the public service) would not be enacted in the short term.

=== Criticisms ===
Many commentators criticized the report for various reasons: alleged bias on the part of the commission, the terms of reference with which it was set up, and the use of evidence in the report. Several, including former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Warren Kinsella, and former cabinet minister Sheila Copps, criticized the commission as being little more than an extension of Liberal party infighting.

Gomery was accused by some as being friendly to Paul Martin, and hostile toward Chrétien. In the spring of 2005, Chrétien&#x27;s lawyers attempted unsuccessfully to have Gomery removed due to his alleged bias. Subsequent to the release of the first report, Chrétien took action in Federal Court to review the commission report on the grounds that Gomery displayed a &quot;reasonable apprehension of bias,&quot; and that some conclusions did not have an &quot;evidentiary&quot; basis.

On 26 June 2008, Federal Court ruled that Gomery had in fact displayed bias in several comments made before the hearings had closed and that his remarks showed that he had prejudged the issues. According to the Court, Gomery had insulted Chrétien when he described the distribution of golf balls bearing the prime minister&#x27;s signature as &quot;small-town cheap.&quot; The court voided those sections of Gomery&#x27;s report dealing with Chrétien and Pelletier. Other comments by Gomery that Chrétien&#x27;s lawyers argued as being indicative of bias included Gomery referring to the management of the sponsorship program as &quot;catastrophically bad&quot; and calling Chuck Guité a &quot;charming scamp.&quot;

Other allegations of bias concern the commission&#x27;s chief counsel, Bernard Roy, a former Chief of Staff to former Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Roy is also a partner in Mulroney&#x27;s law firm where Gomery&#x27;s daughter works. Chrétien&#x27;s lawyers stated that the appointment is a conflict of interest. Roy is a longtime personal friend of the former prime-minister&#x27;s. Brian Mulroney and Jean Chrétien have had an adversarial personal relationship in recent years since the Airbus affair. The choice of counsel may account for the failure to call some Chrétien friendly witnesses.

Conservative leader Stephen Harper was sympathetic to Chrétien&#x27;s complaints of bias, stating that the main problem was that the commission&#x27;s terms of reference did not allow it to investigate Paul Martin&#x27;s contracting habits as finance minister. Other criticisms concern the lack of powers the commission had to investigate criminal matters, which were being investigated by the RCMP.

Chrétien&#x27;s lawyers have indicated they are concerned about conclusions which are not based on evidence, but mere extrapolation. Chrétien, on the day the report was tabled in the House of Commons, objected to the findings of the commission, commenting that Gomery believed the wrong witnesses. &quot;Personally, I believe Jean Pelletier, a man who dedicated his life to the service of his city, his province and his country,&quot; said the former Prime Minister, dismissing Chuck Guité&#x27;s testimony. Chrétien believes that Gomery&#x27;s conclusion that the programme was run out of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office is wrong.

=== Appeal to Federal Court ===
Subsequent to the release of the first report, Chrétien&#x27;s lawyers took action in Federal Court to invalidate the report and clear his name. They want the court to review the commission report on the grounds that Gomery showed a &quot;reasonable apprehension of bias&quot;, and that some conclusions didn&#x27;t have an &quot;evidentiary&quot; basis.

On 26 June 2008, Federal Court ruled that Gomery had in fact displayed bias in several comments made before the hearings had closed and that his remarks showed that he had prejudged the issues. According to the Court, Gomery had personally insulted Chrétien when he described the distribution of golf balls bearing the prime minister&#x27;s signature as &quot;small-town cheap.&quot; The court voided those sections of Gomery&#x27;s report dealing with Chrétien and Pelletier.

The Federal Court also quashed the Gomery Inquiry&#x27;s conclusions that Chrétien and Pelletier bore responsibility for the sponsorship scandal. Justice Max Teitelbaum criticized Gomery for having a preoccupation with the media spotlight that led him to give interviews he should have eschewed, making comments that indicated he judged issues before all evidence was heard, exhibited bias against Chrétien, and trivialized the inquiry proceedings. For instance, Teitelbaum pointed out that Gomery&#x27;s remark halfway through the hearings that &quot;juicy stuff&quot; was yet to come made it appear that evidence of wrongdoing was expected before it was heard.

The federal government was ordered to pay Chrétien&#x27;s legal costs. Chrétien and his aides have described it as vindication. Teitelbaum&#x27;s decision was appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal where it was upheld.

<text>The governor-general of Saint Lucia is the representative of the Saint Lucian monarch, currently King Charles III, in Saint Lucia. The governor-general is appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister of Saint Lucia. The functions of the governor-general include appointing ministers, judges, and ambassadors; giving royal assent to legislation passed by parliament; issuing writs for election.

In general, the governor-general observes the conventions of the Westminster system and responsible government, maintaining political neutrality, and has to always act only on the advice of the prime minister. The governor-general also has a ceremonial role: hosting events at the official residenceGovernment House in the capital, Castriesand bestowing honours to individuals and groups who are contributing to Saint Lucia and to their communities. When travelling abroad, the governor-general is seen as the representative of Saint Lucia and its monarch. The governor-general is supported by a staff headed by the official secretary to the governor-general.

Governors-general formally serve &quot;at the monarch&#x27;s pleasure&quot;. Since 1 November 2024, the governor-general has been Errol Charles.

The office of the governor-general was created on 22 February 1979, when Saint Lucia gained independence from the United Kingdom as a sovereign state and an independent constitutional monarchy. Since then, seven individuals have served as governor-general.

==Appointment==
The governor-general is formally appointed by the monarch of Saint Lucia. When a new governor-general is to be appointed, the prime minister recommends a name to the monarch, who by convention accepts that recommendation. At the installation ceremony, the new governor-general takes an oath of allegiance and an oath of office.

== Functions ==
Saint Lucia shares the person of the sovereign equally with 14 other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations. As the sovereign works and resides predominantly outside of Saint Lucian borders, the governor-general&#x27;s primary task is to perform the monarch&#x27;s constitutional duties on his or her behalf. As such, the governor-general carries out his or her functions in the government of Saint Lucia on behalf and in the name of the Sovereign.

The office of governor-general is provided for by Chapter II, Sections 19 to 22 of the Constitution.

===Constitutional role===

The governor-general is responsible for appointing the Prime Minister, the Cabinet, the Chief Justice of Saint Lucia, members of the Senate, senior civil servants, members of different commissions and boards. The constitution empowers the governor-general to make or revoke appointments to government or public offices and to Commissions and Boards after receiving careful consultation or advice.

The governor-general, on the Sovereign&#x27;s behalf, gives royal assent to laws passed by the Parliament of Saint Lucia.

The governor-general&#x27;s constitutional and parliamentary responsibilities also include: declaration of State of Emergency; summoning, prorogation and dissolution of Parliament; and the Prerogative of Mercy.

The governor-general holds weekly meetings with the prime minister on matters of state and governance.

The governor-general may, in certain circumstances, exercise without—or contrary to—ministerial advice. These are known as the reserve powers.

===Ceremonial role===

The governor-general&#x27;s ceremonial duties include opening new sessions of parliament by delivering the Speech from the Throne, taking the salute during the Independence Day Parade, welcoming visiting heads of state, and receiving the credentials of foreign diplomats.

The governor-general also presents honours at investitures to Saint Lucians for notable service to the community, or for acts of bravery.

===Community role===
The governor-general provides non-partisan leadership in the community, acting as patron of many charitable, service, sporting and cultural organisations, and attending functions throughout the country. The governor-general also encourages, articulates and represents those things that unite Saint Lucians together. In this role, the governor-general provides a focus for national identity, unity and pride by attending at events of national significance such as Independence Day activities and Remembrance Sunday.

The governor-general serves as patron of various organisations such as the Saint Lucia National Trust, the Girl Guides Association of Saint Lucia, Saint Lucia Red Cross, ad the Saint Lucia School of Music.

==Privileges==
The governor-general, serves as the Chancellor of the Order of Saint Lucia, established by Queen Elizabeth II in 1986.

===Salary===

The governor-general receives an annual salary of 36,112 USD.

===Symbols===

The governor-general uses a personal flag, which features a lion passant atop a St. Edward&#x27;s royal crown with &quot;Saint Lucia&quot; written on a scroll underneath, all on a blue background. It is flown on buildings and other locations in Saint Lucia to mark the governor-general&#x27;s presence.

===Residence===

<doc id="466571" wikidata="Q1141749" url="?curid=466571" title="Fiji-class cruiser">
<text>The Fiji&quot;-class cruiserswere a [[Ship class|class]] of eleven [[light cruiser]]s of the [[Royal Navy]] that saw extensive service throughout the [[Second World War]]. Each ship of the class was named after a [[Crown colony]] or other constituent territory of the [[British Empire|British Commonwealth and Empire]]. The class was also known as theColony class, orCrown Colony class. Developed as more compact versions of the preceding s, the last three were built to a slightly modified design and were sometimes also called the Ceylon&quot; class.

==Design==
They were built to the limitations that the 1936 Second London Naval Treaty imposed on cruisers, which lowered the limit for a light cruiser set in the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty from 10,000 tons to 8,000 tons displacement. Externally they appeared as smaller derivatives of the 1936 s.

The &quot;Fiji&quot;-class cruisers however, like the that followed in the middle of the war, essentially carried the same armament on a 1,000-tons less displacement. The &quot;Fiji&quot; and &quot;Minotaur&quot; classes were very tight designs, built largely in war emergency conditions with little margin for any great updating postwar. The beam imposing crippling limits.

The &quot;Fiji&quot; class were distinguishable from the Towns as they had a transom stern and straight funnels and masts; those of the Towns being raked. The armour scheme was revised from that of the Towns; the main belt now protected the ammunition spaces for the guns but the belt itself was reduced to in the machinery spaces. The 6-inch Mk XXIII gun turrets and ammunition spaces were laid out as per the &quot;Edinburgh&quot; group of the Town class, except the after turrets were positioned a deck lower as in the &quot;Southampton&quot; and &quot;Gloucester&quot; groups. The long trunk version of the triple 6-inch turret fitted to the &quot;Fiji&quot; class was 25 tons heavier than the 150-ton turret on the Group 1 &amp; 2 Towns and further cramped the design. The supply of ammunition to the guns was also improved, dispensing with the complicated conveyor system.

Due to the limited size of the &quot;Fiji&quot; class, a number of the ships had their &#x27;X&#x27; turret removed to fit additional light anti-aircraft (AA) guns. Ships of the first group were equipped with the High Angle Control System (HACS) for secondary armament AA fire while the &quot;Ceylon&quot; group used the Fuze Keeping Clock for AA fire control. Both groups used the Admiralty Fire Control Table for surface fire control of the main armament and the Admiralty Fire Control Clock for surface fire control of the secondary armament. By the late 1940s most of the &quot;Fiji&quot; class had the updated Type 274 &#x27;lock and follow&#x27; surface fire control radar, which massively increased the chance of hits from the opening salvoes. In the 1950s (except during the Korean War and Suez crisis) no more than one of the MKXIII turrets was ever manned, with &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; turrets mothballed due to the large number of crew required for their operation. This allowed for more liveable peacetime conditions by operating with a crew of 610–750 rather than the full wartime crew of 1,000–1,100.

==Modifications==
The addition of radar sets meant that spotting aircraft were now surplus to requirements, allowing the removal of the aircraft facilities and catapult. Not only did this provide additional accommodation spaces for enlarged wartime crews, but there was no longer the need to carry large quantities of volatile aviation fuel; in 1940, had her bow blown off when a torpedo detonated the 5,700 gallons of aviation fuel stored forwards and was out of action for a year. &quot;Fiji&quot; and &quot;Kenya&quot; had never received the catapult, &quot;Nigeria&quot; had hers removed in 1941 and the other ships had theirs removed between 1942 and 1944.

The &quot;Ceylon&quot; group were completed without &#x27;X&#x27; 6-inch turret, and between 1944 and 1945, those of &quot;Bermuda&quot;, &quot;Jamaica&quot;, &quot;Mauritius&quot; and &quot;Kenya&quot; were also removed. This allowed the carriage of additional light AA weapons, a quadruple QF 2 pdr pom-pom mounting Mark VII generally being carried in &#x27;X&#x27; position. &quot;Bermuda&quot;, &quot;Jamaica&quot; and &quot;Mauritius&quot; had 2 additional quadruple pom-poms added (for a total of five) and between two and four single pom-poms in powered mountings Mark XV. In &quot;Kenya&quot;, all pom-poms were removed, and were replaced with five twin and eight single 40 mm Bofors guns. By the end of the war, &quot;Newfoundland&quot; had one and &quot;Uganda&quot; had two American pattern quadruple 40 mm Bofors mounts Mark III and &quot;Nigeria&quot; had four single mounts Mark III. Generally, 6 to 24 20 mm Oerlikon guns were also added in a mixture of single mounts Mark IIIA and twin powered mounts Mark V.

Postwar modifications of the class were very limited with improved Type 274 lock and follow surface fire control. &quot;Newfoundland&quot; had a fragile and unreliable &#x27;glasshouse&#x27; version of Type 275 for twin 4-inch control, &quot;Ceylon&quot; had the short range type 262 MRS1 AA control which was limited to about range for tracking. &quot;Bermuda&quot; and &quot;Gambia&quot; had much more advanced US Mk 63 radar with four High Angle Director-Control Tower (DCT) and separate radar disks on the mounts themselves using systems that were released by the cancellation of &#x27;s 1955 long refit. Slightly improved new versions of the basic twin 4-inch gun mounts were generally fitted in extended refits in 1950; these had electric drive and could train and elevate at 20 degrees/sec to track subsonic jets.

US advice and offers under mutual assistance to replace the obsolete and inaccurate 4-inch guns with twin 3-inch 50-calibre turrets of similar weight and dimensions as the RN twin 4-inch Mark XIX turrets were rejected because the RN had huge stocks of 4-inch shells. These ships would have been altered for water sprays to wash off nuclear fallout and received the Type 960 standard long-range air search radar. &quot;Newfoundland&quot; received a greater extent of electrical updating and rewiring with more comprehensive AA fire control and was the only &quot;Fiji&quot;-class vessel updated close to the standard planned for the improved ships. The &quot;Fiji&quot; class were only refitted for shore bombardment and colonial patrol and presence. The mid-1950s refits of &quot;Ceylon&quot;, &quot;Gambia&quot; and &quot;Bermuda&quot; were very austere. They included increasing automation, the life of the geared steam turbines, and reducing manning below decks. There was simplification of the short range anti-aircraft defence to six to eight twin L/60 Bofors in Mk 5 twin mountings with a fire rate increased to 150 rpm per gun (280–300 rpm for each twin mounting). These would have stopped earlier WWII low-level or later Falklands War-type attacks, by which time the RN no longer fitted 40 mm, the last were withdrawn with in 1981.

==Service==
They served with distinction during the Second World War. &quot;Jamaica&quot; took part in a number of operations, including driving off the heavy cruisers and &quot;Lützow&quot; in 1942, the sinking of the battleship in 1943, and escorting carrier air attacks on the battleship in 1944. was sunk in 1941 by German aircraft during the battle of Crete. was lost on Arctic convoy duty in 1942; sailing at reduced speed due to damage in a surface action earlier she was set on fire by German air attack and scuttled. The survivors continued in service after the war, taking part in further actions, such as the Korean War.

 and were sold to Peru in 1959 becoming the &quot;Coronel Bolognesi&quot;, and &quot;Almirante Grau&quot; respectively. These two were decommissioned by 1982. was sold to India who had it reconstructed in 1954–7 to the same standard as &quot;Newfoundland&quot;. As , the ship was heavily used from the time of her transfer, seeing action in the 1971 war with Pakistan, and later converted to a harbour training ship in 1979. She was decommissioned by 1984 and then scrapped in 1985, and as such she was the longest-lived (41 years) member of her class.

All ships of the &quot;Fiji&quot; class were decommissioned from active service with the Royal Navy by 1962 and began being sold for scrap, though &quot;Bermuda&quot; was fully operational during 1961 and sometimes ventured to sea in 1962 as flagship of the Reserve Fleet. &quot;Gambia&quot; had been reduced to reserve in December 1960.

During the 1950s the larger Town-class cruisers were usually regarded as more habitable and comfortable in patrolling in the tropics and Far East, although being older their operational use generally ceased by 1958 and went for scrap the following year except for (which had at sea deployments as a reserve flagship until late 1960 and was then, maintained as a reserve headquarters ship) and which stayed in active seaworthy service until 1963. &quot;Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Belfast&quot; were the last of the wartime commissioned cruisers considered capable of reactivation for GFS and were in semi maintained reserve until the election of the Labour Government in 1964, which immediately decided to scrap them, pending short term use as accommodation ships and consideration for historical preservation.

The last &quot;Fiji&quot;-class cruisers were seriously deteriorating due to being in an unmaintained extended reserve status many years. &quot;Gambia&quot; was considered as an alternative for use as the London museum ship, as the ship&#x27;s condition was more original than &quot;Belfast&quot;, but &quot;Gambia&quot; was sold for scrap in 1968, because the state of the ship made it more expensive to preserve than &quot;Belfast&quot;. .

==Ships of the class==


===Original design===

* &quot;Bermuda&quot; – Took part in Operation Torch, the landings in North Africa, during World War II, as well as other operations. After the war, the ship continued in service, seeing much of the world, and receiving a number of refits which helped her last until her decommissioning in 1962. She was scrapped in 1965.
* &quot;Fiji&quot; – In 1940 &quot;Fiji&quot; was torpedoed by a German U-boat but survived. In 1941, during the Battle of Crete, &quot;Fiji&quot; was damaged by a bomb from a German Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft, after having survived 20 bomb hits, this one caused her to list; further bomb hits increased the list and the cruiser rolled over an hour later. 523 of her crew were picked up.
* &quot;Gambia&quot; – Was transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy from 1943, seeing active service in the British Pacific Fleet. She was returned to the Royal Navy in 1946. The ship was scrapped in 1968.
* &quot;Jamaica&quot; – Served in World War II, taking part in a number of operations during that war, including the sinking of the battleship &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; at the Battle of North Cape, driving off German cruiser &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; at the Battle of the Barents Sea, and escorting carrier air attacks on the battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. In the Korean War, &quot;Jamaica&quot; was known as &quot;The Galloping Ghost of the Korean Coast&quot;, due to the North Koreans claiming that she had been sunk three times. In 1955 &quot;Jamaica&quot; was used to play in the film &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot;. She was scrapped in 1960.
* &quot;Kenya&quot; – Was heavily involved in World War II, being deployed to the Far East for some time. &quot;Kenya&quot; was also involved in the Korean War. She was scrapped in 1962.
* &quot;Mauritius&quot; – She was involved in the Normandy Landings, and other actions during World War II. She was scrapped in 1965.
* – Was involved in Operation Pedestal (when she was damaged by Italian submarine &quot;Axum&quot;), the largest attempt to assist the besieged island of Malta in 1942. She participated in raids on Sumatra as part of the Eastern Fleet in 1945, as well as a number of other deployments. She was sold to India in 1958, being renamed . She was scrapped in 1985.
* &quot;Trinidad&quot; – In 1942 while engaging three German destroyers attacking convoy Convoy PQ13, she was hit by her own torpedo, which had a faulty gyroscope causing it to run in circles, though she did destroy one of the German warships. After temporary repairs in USSR, on return journey through Barents Sea to UK &quot;Trinidad&quot; was hit by a bomb from &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Junkers Ju 88 bombers, further damaging her to an extent that she was scuttled with a torpedo the following day.

===&quot;Ceylon&quot; group===
* – Was deployed to the Far East for much of World War II, and was heavily involved in the Korean War. She was decommissioned in 1960, and subsequently sold to Peru, being renamed &quot;Coronel Bolognesi&quot;. She was decommissioned in 1982.
* – She was torpedoed by the , receiving temporary repairs at Malta, and full repairs at Boston Navy Yard. In 1944, the ship suffered an explosion at Alexandria while docked there. She sustained heavy damage, and suffered a number of casualties. She was in the Far East from 1945, supporting a number of operations there, and was present at the Japanese surrender, being one of the few British ships able to reach Japan in time. She sank the Egyptian frigate &quot;Domiat&quot;, during the Suez operations, after the latter ship fired on her. She was sold to Peru in 1959, being renamed &quot;Almirante Grau&quot; and then &quot;Capitan Quinones&quot; in 1973. She was decommissioned in 1979 and scrapped in Japan, the country that she and her crew fought against in World War II.
* – Escorted to Washington, D.C., with Winston Churchill embarked. Covered the invasion of Sicily in 1943. She was then hit by a German glide bomb that same year, causing significant damage and killing sixteen of her crew and wounding seven. Following repairs carried out in 1944 in the US she was recommissioned in the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS &quot;Uganda&quot;. She joined the British Pacific Fleet in 1945 taking part in a number of actions in the Far East. She was put in reserve in 1947 but recommissioned as HMCS &quot;Quebec&quot; for service in the Korean War. The ship was scrapped in 1961.

<doc id="466572" wikidata="Q7089222" url="?curid=466572" title="Olympus C-8080 Wide Zoom">
<text>The Olympus C-8080 WZ is a digital camera formerly manufactured by Olympus. It was first announced on the opening day of the 2004 Photo Marketing Association Annual Convention and Trade Show. At the time, the C-8080 was set to be Olympus’ first eight-megapixel digital camera for the high-end consumer market. The MSRP was $1,149 USD.

A key feature, described in the name, is the camera’s optical zoom range. Most compact &quot;zoom&quot; cameras of the era were marketed for telephoto photography, providing high magnification of a distant subject. The lens of this camera includes a wide angle range suitable for group or landscape photography. It has a high resolution lens with 5x zoom (7.1 - 35.6 mm, 28 - 140 mm in 35mm equivalent) and an aperture ranging from at the widest angle to at maximum zoom. The focus range in normal mode is 0.8 m - inf., 20 - 80 cm in macro, and down to 5 cm in super-macro.

The metering modes for exposure are: ESP, center-weighted, multi-metering and spot. The metering target mark on the screen can be moved in 13 positions in spot mode. For absolute control a live histogram can be activated and the histogram target mark can be moved by the user. An AutoExposure Lock (AEL) button can lock the metered exposure.

The camera has two autofocus systems: one is based on contrast detection, the other on phase-difference detection (P-AF).
The metering settings for the focus are: iESP, spot, full-time AF, P-AF, manual focus, macro, and super-macro. One of 9 positions can be selected for the AF target in spot mode.

Video can be recorded at 640 x 480 and 320 x 240, both at 15 frames per second. Clip length is only limited by the storage card.

The camera accepts xD-Picture Cards (necessary for panorama shooting), CompactFlash type I and II and IBM microdrives with two slots.
Copying between slots is possible in the camera.
Photos can be stored in TIFF, RAW and JPEG format.
Videos are stored in Quicktime format using Motion JPEG encoding. Sound could also be recorded with still photos in Wave audio format. Data transfer connectivity is USB 2.0. 

The rear display is a 4.5 cm tilting sunshine-LCD with 134,000 pixels, and the electronic viewfinder has 240,000 pixels.

The C-8080 WZ was succeeded at least partially by the C-7070 WZ in 2005. The latter camera was considered the successor of the C-5060 WZ, but had similar specifications and target market to the C-8080 WZ. Compared to the C-8080 WZ, the C-7070 WZ had a slower lens, was a slightly smaller size, and had a lower list price.

<text>James Beauchamp Clark (March 7, 1850March 2, 1921) was an American politician and attorney who served as the 36th speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1911 to 1919. He was the only Democrat to serve as speaker during the Progressive Era when Republicans dominated the House, Senate, and presidency. Clark represented Missouri&#x27;s district between 1893 and 1921.

Born in Kentucky, Clark established a law practice in Bowling Green, Missouri. After serving in local, county, and state office, he won election to the U.S. House in 1892, lost his seat in 1894, and won the seat back in 1896. He became the House Minority Leader in 1908 and was elevated to Speaker after Democrats took control of the House in the 1910 elections. He inadvertently helped defeat the Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty of 1911 by arguing that ratification of the treaty would lead to the incorporation of Canada into the United States.

Entering the 1912 Democratic National Convention, Clark had won the backing of a majority of the delegates, but lacked the necessary two-thirds majority to win the presidential nomination. After dozens of ballots, Woodrow Wilson emerged as the Democratic presidential nominee, and went on to win the 1912 presidential election. Clark helped Wilson pass much of his progressive agenda but opposed U.S. entry into World War I. In the 1918 midterm elections, Democrats lost their control of the House of Representatives, ending Clark&#x27;s tenure as Speaker. The 1920 House elections saw the defeat of numerous Democrats, including Clark. He died the following March, two days before he would have left office.

==Early life and education==
Clark was born in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, to John Hampton Clark and Aletha Beauchamp. Through his mother, he was the first cousin twice removed of the famous lawyer-turned-murderer Jereboam O. Beauchamp. He is also directly descended from the famous John Beauchamp (Plymouth Company) through his mother. He graduated from Bethany College in 1873, and from Cincinnati Law School in 1875.

== Career ==
Clark served as president of Marshall College (now Marshall University) from 1873 to 1874. In 1875, he was admitted to the bar, and the following year he moved to Bowling Green, Missouri, the county seat of Pike County, where he practiced law. He was city attorney from 1878 to 1881, and prosecuting attorney of Pike County from 1885 to 1889.

===Politics===
Clark was a member of the Missouri House of Representatives in 1889 and 1891. Clark was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1892. After a surprise loss in 1894 to William M. Treloar, he regained the seat in 1896, and remained in the House until his death, the day before he was to leave office.

Clark ran for House Minority Leader in 1903 but was defeated by John Sharp Williams of Mississippi. After Williams ran for the Senate in 1908, Clark ran again for the position and won. When the Democrats won control of the House in 1911, Clark became Speaker.

====Canadian reciprocity treaty====

In 1911, Clark gave a speech that helped to decide the election in Canada. On the floor of the House, Clark argued for the recent Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty of 1911 and declared: &quot;I look forward to the time when the American flag will fly over every square foot of British North America up to the North Pole.&quot;

Clark went on to suggest in his speech that the treaty was the first step towards the end of Canada, a speech that was greeted with &quot;prolonged applause&quot; according to the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported, &quot;Evidently, then, the Democrats generally approved of Mr. Clark&#x27;s annexation sentiments and voted for the reciprocity bill because, among other things, it improves the prospect of annexation.&quot;

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; condemned Clark in an editorial, predicting that Clark&#x27;s speech might have fatally damaged the treaty in Canada; &quot;He lets his imagination run wild like a Missouri mule on a rampage. Remarks about the absorption of one country by another grate harshly on the ears of the smaller.&quot; The Conservative Party of Canada, which opposed the treaty, won the Canadian election in large part because of Clark&#x27;s speech.

====Later career====
In 1912, Clark was the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, coming into the convention with a majority of delegates pledged to him, but he failed to receive the necessary two-thirds of the vote on the first several ballots. After lengthy negotiation, clever management by supporters of New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, with widespread allegations of influence by special interests, delivered the nomination instead to Wilson.

Clark&#x27;s speakership was notable for his skill from 1910 to 1914 in maintaining party unity to block William Howard Taft&#x27;s legislation and then pass Wilson&#x27;s. Clark split the party in 1917 and 1918, when he opposed Wilson&#x27;s decision to bring the United States into World War I.

In addition, Clark opposed the Federal Reserve Act, which concentrated financial power in the hands of eastern banks (mostly centered in New York City). Clark&#x27;s opposition to the Federal Reserve Act is said to be the reason that Missouri is the only state granted two Federal Reserve Banks (one in St. Louis and one in Kansas City).

Clark was defeated in the Republican landslide of 1920 and died shortly thereafter in his home in Washington, D.C.

Champ Clark is the namesake of the small community of Champ, Audrain County, Missouri. The former Clark National Forest likewise was named after him.

==Personal life==
Clark married Genevieve Bennett Clark on December 14, 1881. Together, they had two children, Joel Bennett Clark and Genevieve Clark Thomson. Bennett served as a United States senator from Missouri from 1933 to 1945. Genevieve was a suffragette and a candidate for the House of Representatives for Louisiana.

He was an adherent of the Disciples of Christ.

=== Champ Clark Bridge ===
A bridge in Louisiana, Missouri that connects Missouri to neighboring Illinois was originally built in 1928. It bears the name Champ Clark. In late 2019, another bridge of the same name was constructed to replace the structurally deficient original bridge.

<doc id="466583" wikidata="Q1103063" url="?curid=466583" title="Club Nouveau">
<text>Club Nouveau () is an American R&amp;B group formed by record producer/performer Jay King in 1986 in Sacramento, California, following the breakup of the Timex Social Club. The group&#x27;s name (French for &quot;Club New&quot;) was changed from its original incarnation, &quot;Jet Set&quot;, to capitalize on the breakup. The group was signed by Warner Bros. Records, on which Club Nouveau released its first three albums. Club Nouveau&#x27;s go-go version of Bill Withers&#x27;s song &quot;Lean on Me&quot; won a Grammy award for Best R&amp;B Song in 1987.

==History==
From its debut album, &quot;Life, Love &amp; Pain&quot;, which was released in 1986, the group scored four consecutive hits: &quot;Jealousy&quot; (essentially an answer song responding to Timex Social Club&#x27;s hit &quot;Rumors&quot;), &quot;Situation #9&quot;, &quot;Lean on Me&quot; and &quot;Why You Treat Me So Bad&quot;. The latter two both made it to #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart the next year, with &quot;Lean on Me&quot; going on to become a big &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit. &quot;Jealousy&quot; also made an appearance on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Modern Girls&quot;. &quot;Why You Treat Me So Bad&quot; was interpolated by the hip-hop duo Luniz, on its hit single &quot;I Got 5 on It&quot;, and subsequently by rapper/record producer Puff Daddy on his #1 R&amp;B single &quot;Satisfy You&quot;.

The group&#x27;s original lineup consisted of Jay King, Valerie Watson, Samuelle Prater, Denzil Foster, and Thomas McElroy. Foster and McElroy soon left to form their own production team and focus on working with other acts. Prater, who had performed lead vocals on &quot;Lean on Me,&quot; eventually left as well to pursue a solo career but reunited with the group in 2009.

The group&#x27;s next albums — beginning with &quot;Listen to the Message&quot; — were laced with an evolving social consciousness. Notable recordings include &quot;You Ain&#x27;t No Friend of Mine&quot; from &quot;Under A Nouveau Groove&quot;; a dancehall-influenced version of the Gospel classic &quot;Oh, Happy Day,&quot; from &quot;A New Beginning&quot;; &quot;Let It Go&quot; from &quot;Everything Is Black&quot;; and &quot;What Kind of Love&quot; from &quot;The Collection Volume I&quot;. The group also recorded &quot;Step by Step&quot; for the &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; soundtrack.

Club Nouveau was nominated for a Grammy for Best R&amp;B Performance in 1987. The group&#x27;s version of &quot;Lean on Me&quot; was its most celebrated hit, resulting in a Grammy nomination for Song of the Year in addition to winning the Grammy for Best R&amp;B Song that same year. &quot;Lean on Me&quot; was also nominated for two American Music Awards, nominated and won a Bammy Award, a BRE Drummer award, a Bay Area Star award and it won two NARM (National Association of Recording Merchandisers) awards.

The 2015 lineup consists of King, Watson, and Prater.

In 2017, as part of Warner Music&#x27;s divestment requirements as a result of its purchase of Parlophone, the group&#x27;s Warner Bros. recordings were acquired by Tommy Boy Records, which worked 12-inch singles from its first album to clubs as a result of its emerging relationship with Warner and from being an expert in the format.

<text>The Type 22 frigate also known as the &quot;Broadsword&quot; class was a class of frigates built for the British Royal Navy. Fourteen were built in total, with production divided into three batches.

Initially intended to be anti-submarine warfare frigates as part of NATO contribution, the ships became general purpose warships.

HMS &quot;Cornwall&quot; was the last Royal Navy Type 22 frigate, retired from service on 30 June 2011.

Five Type 22s were scrapped and two more were sunk as targets. The seven other vessels were sold to the Brazilian, Romanian and Chilean navies; four of these remain in service, one was sunk as a target, one laid up, and one sold for scrap.

==Ship naming==

===&quot;Broadsword&quot;, &quot;Boxer&quot;===
It was originally envisaged that all Type 22s would have names beginning with &#x27;B&#x27; (&quot;Broadsword&quot;, etc.), following the &#x27;A&#x27; names used for Type 21 frigates (&quot;Amazon&quot;, etc.). This changed after the Falklands War when two replacement ships were ordered for the destroyers sunk (&quot;Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Coventry&quot;) and were named to commemorate them. Another vessel ordered earlier but not yet started, which was to be named &quot;Bloodhound&quot; was renamed &quot;London&quot;.

===&quot;Cornwall&quot;===
The alphabetical progression was re-established with the Batch 3 ships (&quot;Cornwall&quot;, etc.) before being temporarily abandoned with the Type 23 class, named after Dukedoms (&quot;Norfolk&quot;, &quot;Lancaster&quot;, etc.). The Royal Navy&#x27;s latest escort class – the Type 45 or &quot;Daring&quot; class – have re-introduced the alphabetical progression, using destroyer names from the 1930s and 1950s.

The names selected for the four Batch 3 ships were a mixture: two, &quot;Cornwall&quot; and &quot;Cumberland&quot;, revived County-class names previously carried both by First World War-era armoured cruisers, and by Second World War-era heavy cruisers. The other Batch 3s, &quot;Chatham&quot; and &quot;Campbeltown&quot;, were Town names, the former reviving a 1911 light cruiser name, and the latter commemorating famous for participation in the St Nazaire Raid in 1942; the name for HMS &quot;Chatham&quot; was selected as a salute to the Medway town, where the Chatham Dockyard, established in 1570, had closed in 1984.

==Design==
The Type 22 was designed to be a specialist anti-submarine warfare vessel as part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s contribution to NATO. During Royal Navy service the ships evolved into general purpose frigates with weapons for use against other surface ships, aircraft and submarines. They were built in three batches giving rise to three sub-classes, the first &quot;Broadsword&quot; of four ships, the second &quot;Boxer&quot; of six ships and the third and final, &quot;Cornwall&quot; of four ships. During their Royal Navy service the ships had enhanced command, control and co-ordination facilities that resulted in their often being used as flagships on deployments.

The four &quot;Broadsword&quot;s were sold to Brazil in the mid 1990s. In the early 2000s Romania acquired and modernised two of the Batch 2 ships (without acquiring the SeaWolf or Exocet missiles), while a third was purchased by Chile.

==Development==
Following the cancellation of the aircraft carrier programme CVA-01 in 1966, the Royal Navy undertook a reappraisal of the surface fleet, and concluded that the following five new ship types were required:
* A cruiser-type ship to operate large ASW helicopters (this requirement eventually led to the s);
* An air defence destroyer smaller and cheaper than the (this resulted in the Type 42 programme);
* A missile-armed frigate as an eventual successor to the Type 12 &quot;Leander&quot; class (this requirement led to the Type 22);
* A cheap patrol frigate (this requirement led to the Type 21); and
* A dual-role mine countermeasures vessel successor to the (this resulted in the )

Of these, the air defence destroyer appeared to had been given highest priority, the imperative being to get Sea Dart to sea in numbers to replace the air defence capability which would be lost with the retirement of the carrier fleet.

Due to the workload of the Admiralty design department in the 1960s, a private design (Type 21) was purchased as an interim stop-gap whilst the Type 22 was under development. The design process, already hampered by the priority given to the Type 21 and the urgently needed Type 42, was further protracted by attempts to produce a common Anglo-Dutch design. The first Type 22 order was placed in 1972 with Yarrow Shipbuilders; Yarrow undertook much of the detailed design work whilst overall responsibility remained with the Ship Department at Bath.
===Batch 1===
The length of the first four Type 22s was dictated by the dimensions of the undercover Frigate Refit Complex at Devonport Dockyard. The ships would be powered by a combination of Olympus and Tyne gas turbines in a COGOG (combined gas turbine or gas turbine) arrangement. Machinery spaces were sited as far aft as possible to minimise shaft lengths. The after configuration was dictated by the requirement for a large hangar and a full-width flight deck. Electrical power was provided by GEC generators powered by four Paxman Ventura 16YJCAZ diesel engines, each rated at 1MW.

Weapons fit was determined by the primary ASW role combined with a perceived need for a general purpose capability. The principal ASW weapons systems were the ship&#x27;s Westland Lynx helicopter and triple torpedo tubes (STWS), with the large Type 2016 sonar a key part of the sensor fit. Air defence was provided in the form of two &#x27;six-pack&#x27; launchers for the Seawolf (GWS 25) point-defence missile system. Surface warfare requirements were met by the provision of four Exocet missile launchers, the standard RN fit at that time. A pair of Bofors 40 mm L/60 guns were fitted in the first batch for patrolling and &quot;junk-busting&quot; on summer Indian Ocean deployments, but proved an impediment in the Falklands War where Type 22 captains considered they interfered with concentrating on the Seawolf setup.

The &quot;Broadsword&quot; design was unique to the Royal Navy in lacking a main gun armament. Although some of the &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates had lost their main gun armament during upgrades, was the first to be designed from the beginning without a large-calibre gun turret.

Ordering of Type 22s proceeded slowly, in part because of the comparatively high unit cost of the ships. The unit cost of the last Type 12Ms () had been about £10m; Type 21s cost around £20m each; when the first Type 22s were ordered, unit costs were estimated at £30m though, by the time that the first ship (&quot;Broadsword&quot;) commissioned in 1979, inflation had driven this figure up to £68m, which was far higher than the cost of the contemporary Type 42s (, also commissioned in 1979, cost £40m).

===Batch 2===
After the first four (&quot;Batch I&quot;) ships, the design was &quot;stretched&quot;, with the Frigate Refit Complex suitably enlarged. Visually, and in addition to the increase in length, the biggest difference was the sharply raked stem, usually indicative of bow sonar though none of the Batch II ships was thus fitted. An important addition to the Batch II group was a new computer assisted command system (CACS-1), replacing the CAAIS fitted to the Batch I ships. This could track up to 500 targets, including those detected by the ships&#x27; new Type 2031Z passive towed array sonar and ESM The most significant change in this group of six Type 22 frigates is much more sophisticated electronic warfare systems, particularly the Classic Outboard system for the intercept of Soviet naval and submarine communications. This very sophisticated and specialised versions of the Type 22 were specifically approved by the Prime Minister James Callaghan. The larger hull also improved sea keeping, but never achieved the expected quietness with towed arrays due to failure to raft mount the diesel generators. This would be important in operations in the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap where the ships were expected to play an important role in preventing and monitoring the passage of Soviet naval units at a critical stage of the Cold War. A revised machinery installation was adopted for , with Rolls-Royce Spey turbines replacing the previous Rolls-Royce Olympus in a Combination Of Gas turbine Or Gas turbine (COGOG) arrangement. Though this reverted to the previous Olympus / Tyne COGOG arrangement for the next three batch II ships, the future machinery arrangement adopted for the batch III vessels would be Combination of Gas turbine And Gas turbine (COGAG) utilising the Spey / Tyne arrangement as fitted in HMS &quot;Brave&quot;. Further improvements from HMS &quot;Brave&quot; onwards included a taller helicopter hangar, giving the ships the ability to carry a single Westland Sea King or EH101 Merlin instead of two Lynx. By 1982, the quoted unit cost of a Type 22 had risen to £127m.

&quot;Broadsword&quot; and &quot;Brilliant&quot; participated in the Falklands War and replacements for the ships lost in the South Atlantic were all Type 22s.

===Batch 3===

The four Batch III ships – &quot;Cornwall&quot;, &quot;Cumberland&quot;, &quot;Campbeltown&quot; and &quot;Chatham&quot; – were completed to a revised design which reflected lessons learned in the Falklands War. The weapons fit was changed, becoming more optimised for a general warfare role. The only major weapon systems shared with the previous vessels were the pair of six-cell Seawolf launchers and the torpedo tubes. The ships were fitted with a 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mk.8 gun, primarily to provide naval gunfire support for forces on land. Exocet was replaced by the superior Harpoon with eight GWS 60 missile launchers fitted laterally abaft the bridge, and each ship carried a 30 mm Goalkeeper CIWS to provide last-ditch defence against anti-ship missiles.

Electrical power in Batch 3 ships is provided by Paxman Valenta 12RPA200 diesel engines, replacing the Ventura engines used on earlier ships.

In their final form, the Type 22s were the largest frigates built to date for the Royal Navy. Reflecting this, Type 22s were often deployed as flagships for NATO Task Groups.

==Construction and running costs==

===Construction programme===
On 11 January 1985, Mr. Dalyell asked the Secretary of State for Defence: &quot;what is the latest cost estimate of a type 22 frigate, with stores, spare parts and ammunition.&quot; The Secretary of State for Defence, Mr. Lee, replied: &quot;The average cost of a batch III type 22 frigate is currently estimated at £140 million at 1984–85 prices. The cost of embarked helicopters, the first outfit of stores, spare parts and ammunition are estimated at £18 million at the same price level.&quot;

===Running costs===

==Availability==

In February 1998, in response to a written question in parliament by Mike Hancock, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Dr John Reid said: &quot;Type 22 frigates achieved approximately 82 to 86 per cent. average availability for operational service in each of the last five years. This discounts time spent in planned maintenance.&quot;

==Ships – disposal and current state==
In May 2000, the Secretary of State for Defence was asked the planned service life of &quot;London&quot;, &quot;Beaver, &quot; Boxer, and &quot; Brave&quot; and the forecast date for withdrawal from Royal Navy service, &quot;prior to the decision in the Strategic Defence Review to dispose of them.&quot; The Minister of State for the Armed Forces, John Spellar, replied in a written answer: &quot;The planned service for each ship was 18 years&quot; and The additional information is given in the table.&quot; Note that the 18 years was dated from the date of acceptance, not the date first commissioned.
In July 2000, the Secretary of State for Defence was asked when he planned to withdraw the remaining Type 22 Batch II frigates from service. The Minister of State for the Armed Forces, John Spellar, replied that HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot; would be withdrawn in 2012 and superseded by a Type 45 destroyer, &quot;Coventry&quot; in 2001 superseded by HMS &quot;St. Albans&quot;, a Type 23 frigate

<text>Pedro Francisco Duque Duque, OF, OMSE (Madrid, 14 March 1963) is a Spanish astronaut and aeronautics engineer who served as minister of Science from 2018 to 2021 and member of the Congress of Deputies, representing Alicante, from May 2019 until February 2020.

Since December 2023, he is the chair of Hispasat.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
He was born in Madrid in 1963. His father was an air traffic controller and his mother a school teacher, both were from Badajoz. In 1986, Duque earned a degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. In 1986, he worked for GMV and for the European Space Agency (ESA) for six years before being selected as a candidate to become an astronaut in 1992.

=== Astronaut ===
Duque underwent training in both Russia and the United States. His first spaceflight was as a mission specialist aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-95, during which Duque supervised ESA experimental modules. In October 2003, Duque visited the International Space Station on board a Soyuz TMA Ship for several days during a crew changeover. The name designated by ESA/Spain for the scientific program of this visit was Misión Cervantes.

===University and business===
In 2003, he started working at UPM School of Aeronautical Engineers as head of operations of the Spanish USOC, also lecturing students on space science and operations.

In 2006, Duque was named Managing Director (CEO) of Deimos Imaging, a private company, that in 2009 put in orbit the first Spanish earth observation satellite (Deimos 1) for application in agriculture, forestry wildfire detection and control. In 2011, he was named Executive President of the Company.

=== Return to the ESA ===
In October 2011, Duque returned to his position at the European Space Agency, reprising his role as an astronaut. Until 2015, he was the leader of the Flight Operations Office, with responsibility for ESA operations in the ISS. In 2016, Duque participated in ESA CAVES training. After that he assumed responsibility for the review of future ESA crewed flights, within the ESA&#x27;s astronaut corps.

=== Minister ===

After the success of the June 2018 vote of no confidence in the government of Mariano Rajoy, Pedro Sánchez, leader of the new government, named Pedro Duque Minister of Science, Innovation and Universities.

In April 2019, Duque announced that his ministry was going to increase Spain&#x27;s contribution to the European Space Agency by €701 million between 2020 and 2026 to ensure an appropriate contribution commensurate with the size of the Spanish economy.

Along side the rest of the Sánchez cabinet, Duque ran for the April 2019 and November 2019 general elections, being elected MP for Alicante. In January 2020, Sánchez confirmed Duque as minister of Science and Innovation, with responsibility for university affairs being granted to Manuel Castells, as the first minister of Universities. He resigned as an MP on 21 February 2020, shortly after being confirmed as minister of Science.

In May 2022, he was appointed to the strategic committee of Destinus as an advisor. The company founded by serial entrepreneur Mikhail Kokorich is developing a hypersonic liquid hydrogen aircraft.

In December 2023, he was appointed as chair of Hispasat.

<doc id="466601" wikidata="Q178933" url="?curid=466601" title="Hardanger fiddle">
<text>A Hardanger fiddle () is a traditional stringed instrument considered to be the national instrument of Norway. In modern designs, this type of fiddle is very similar to the violin, though with eight or nine strings (rather than four as on a standard violin) and thinner wood. The earliest known example of the is from 1651, made by Ole Jonsen Jaastad in Hardanger, Norway. Originally, the instrument had a rounder, narrower body. Around the year 1850, the modern layout with a body much like the violin became the norm.

The F-holes of the Hardanger fiddle are distinctive, oftentimes with a more &quot;sunken&quot; appearance, and generally straighter edges (unlike the frilly, swirly F-holes of a violin). Four of the strings are strung and played like a violin, while the rest, named understrings or sympathetic strings, resonate under the influence of the other four. These additional strings are tuned and secured with extra pegs at the top of the scroll, effectively doubling the length of a Hardingfele scroll when compared to a violin. The sympathetic strings, once fastened to their pegs, are funneled through a &quot;hollow&quot; constructed fingerboard, which is built differently than a violin&#x27;s, being slightly higher and thicker to allow for these extra strings. The resonant strings lie on the center of the special bridge, attached to extra hooks (or fine-tuners) on the tailpiece. Carved out within the center of the bridge is a smaller secondary &quot;bridge&quot;, or opening, designed specifically for these resonant strings to pass through. This is where the resonance is picked up and reverberated. As notes are played, the vibrations are sent through the bridge, where the sympathetics echo those notes. 

The Hardingfele&#x27;s bridge is unique compared to other bowed instruments. It is somewhat taller and wider, resulting in the strings being slightly lower and further apart; this allows for the easy execution of double-stops (playing of two strings at once). A similar technique is seen in some American old-time and bluegrass fiddlers, who intentionally move their bridge back a few millimetres closer to the tailpiece, for better double-stops.

The is used mainly in the southwest part of Norway, whereas the ordinary violin (called , &#x27;flat fiddle&#x27;, or , &#x27;common fiddle&#x27;) is found elsewhere. The is used for dancing, accompanied by rhythmic loud foot stomping. It was also traditional for the fiddler to lead the bridal procession to the church.

The instrument is often highly decorated, with a carved animal (usually a dragon or the Lion of Norway) or a carved woman&#x27;s head as part of the scroll at the top of the pegbox, extensive mother of pearl inlay on the tailpiece and fingerboard, and black ink decorations called &#x27;rosing&#x27; on the body of the instrument. Pieces of bone are sometimes used to decorate the pegs and the edges of the instrument.

==Tunings==

Unlike the violin, the is a transposing instrument, meaning sheet music for the is written in a key other than the one where the instrument sounds when it plays that music. Specifically, the is a D instrument, meaning that the &#x27;s written C corresponds to D on a non-transposing instrument, such as the piano. The notes given below for tunings are therefore relative to the &#x27;s written A, not to a concert A.

The understrings are tuned to vibrate according to the main tuning. For example, when the main strings are tuned A-D-A-E, the understrings are tuned B-D-E-F-A. The tuning largely depends on the region in which the instrument is being played, or the requirements of a particular tune.

In Norway, more than 20 different tunings are recorded. Most hardanger tunes are played in a common tuning (A-D-A-E). The hardanger fiddle can also be played in &quot;low bass&quot;, the word &quot;bass&quot; referring to the lowest string, (G-D-A-E), the normal violin tuning. In certain regions, the &quot;Gorrlaus&quot; (F-D-A-E) tuning is sometimes used. Many well-known players (such as Annbjørg Lien) frequently employ E-scale tunings; i.e., instead of A-D-A-E, with tunes being mainly played in a D-scale, the instrument will be tuned to B-E-B-F#, so the tunes are mostly in an E-scale. Going higher still, the player Knut Buen recorded several albums in an F-scale tuning, C-F-C-G. This is possible only on a smaller-bodied instrument (such as a Hardanger fiddle), being rarely attempted on a standard full-sized violin. As a substitute, many fiddlers who play standard violins will simply tune their G string to A, using the A-D-A-E tuning, enabling them to play the same style of music.

Another tuning is called &quot;troll tuning&quot; (A-E-A-C). Troll tuning is used for the tunes, also called the devil&#x27;s tunes, as well as the tunes from the Kivlemøyane suite (thus associated with the hulderpeople as well as the devil). In the Valdres district of Norway, using this particular tuning is called &quot;greylighting&quot;, a reminder that the fiddler tuned his fiddle like this when the morning was near, and he had played himself through a number of other tunings.

Legend has it that the fiddler learned tunes from the devil. This tuning limits the melodic range of the tunes and is therefore sparsely used.

==Technique==
The technique of bowing a also differs from that used with a violin. It&#x27;s a smoother, bouncier style of bowing, with a lighter touch. The player usually bows on two of the upper strings at a time, and sometimes three. This is made easy by the relative flatness of the bridge, unlike the more curved bridge on a violin. The objective is to create a continuous sound of two (or more due to the sympathetic understrings) pitches. The strings of the fiddle are slimmer than those of the violin, resembling the strings of violins from the baroque period. Many classically trained violinists use a baroque bow when playing the in order to counteract the extra weight that classical violinists naturally place on the string.

Here is an example of technique shown by Rose Logan with an instrument held at St Cecilia&#x27;s Hall.

==The Hardanger fiddle and religion==
The has had a long history with the Christian church. Well known early fiddle maker Isak Botnen is said to have learned some of his craft from church lay leader and school master Lars Klark, along with the methods for varnishing from pastor Dedrik Muus. In many folktales, the devil is associated with the ; in fact many good players were said to have been taught to play by the devil, if not by the nix. During religious revivals in the 19th century, many fiddles (regular and Hardanger) were destroyed or hidden both by fiddlers and laypeople who thought &quot;that it would be best for the soul that the fiddles be burned&quot;, as it was viewed as a &quot;sinful instrument that encouraged wild dances, drinking and fights.&quot; This happened in Norway, as well as other parts of Europe, and until the 20th century playing a Hardanger fiddle in a church building was forbidden. Some fiddlers, however, played on, in spite of all condemnation, and thus valuable traditions remained intact. The first folk musicians to perform in a church were the fiddlers Johannes Dahle from Tinn, and Gjermund Haugen from Notodden. Dahle performed in the 1920s.

Known modern fiddler Annbjørg Lien has played with church organist Iver Kleive, but even she has experienced prejudice before performance from the religious side. Also, the oldest known fiddles still in existence can be heard accompanied by the oldest playable church pipe organ in Norway (originally built for an 18th-century church) on the album &quot;&quot; by Knut Hamre and Benedicte Maurseth. While the use of a in church in Norway may still be a bit sensitive for some, fiddlers in other parts of the world have no problems playing in churches for all types of occasions, including weddings.

==Influences==
Edvard Grieg adapted many Hardanger folk tunes into his compositions, and composed tunes for the Hardanger as part of his score for Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; Suite No. 1. The opening phrase of &quot;Morning&quot; from Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; music is derived from the tuning of the sympathetic strings of the Hardanger fiddle: A F E D E F and so on.

In recent years, the instrument has gained recognition in the rest of the world. Japan has been one of the countries that has found an interest in the hardingfele and Japanese musicians travel to Norway just to learn to play this instrument. In 1997, the Australian classical composer Liza Lim wrote the piece &quot;Philtre&quot; for a solo Hardanger fiddle, and she also includes the instrument in her work &quot;Winding Bodies: 3 Knots&quot; (2013–14). Her string quartet &quot;The Weaver&#x27;s Knot&quot; (2013–14) is inspired by the sound and performance techniques of Hardanger fiddle playing.
Another recent work is &quot;mobius II&quot; for hardanger fiddle and electronics by the British composer Rose Dodd (2011, premiered at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival by Britt Pernille Froholm).

==Players==
Notable players include Lillebjørn Nilsen, Knut Buen, Hauk Buen, Olav Jørgen Hegge, Annbjørg Lien, Sigrid Moldestad, Myllarguten (Targjei Augundsson), Lars Fykerud, Lars Jensen, Nils Økland, Tuva Syvertsen, Benedicte Maurseth, Anne Hytta, Gjermund Haugen and fiddler Kathryn Tickell, the Irish fiddlers and , and American players Loretta Kelley, Andrea Een, Dan Trueman and the multi instrumentalist David Lindley.

In March 2010, Olav Luksengård Mjelva won the Traditional music/Norwegian folk category (the Norwegian equivalent of the Grammy Awards), for his album .

==Use in film==
The Hardanger fiddle was used in the soundtracks of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; composed by Howard Shore, to provide the main voice for the Rohan theme. The use of the Hardanger fiddle in this movie, however, is far from traditional since the theme does not make noticeable use of the usual practice of bowing on two strings at a time for harmony. The violinist also used vibrato, which is not traditionally used since the slight variance in pitch interferes with the sympathetic resonance of the under-strings. It was also used by composer John Powell and played by Dermot Crehan in the DreamWorks film &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; for the main romantic theme.

The Hardanger fiddle is also featured in the soundtrack of &quot;Armageddon&quot; (composed by Trevor Rabin), and in &quot;Fargo&quot; (composed by Carter Burwell). In the latter, the context is a little more traditional—the main theme it plays is an arrangement of a Norwegian folk song entitled &quot;The Lost Sheep&quot;.

Steven Van Zandt used the Hardanger fiddle in the theme song he wrote for the TV series &quot;Lilyhammer&quot;.

In the Japanese animated movie &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; it is played by Rio Yamase.

The Hardanger fiddle is featured in the soundtrack of the 2017 film &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, as well as the soundtrack for the 2021 &quot;Loki&quot; series.

<doc id="466603" wikidata="Q481372" url="?curid=466603" title="Official Languages Act (Canada)">
<text>The Official Languages Act () is a Canadian law that came into force on September 9, 1969, which gives French and English equal status in the government of Canada. This makes them &quot;official&quot; languages, having preferred status in law over all other languages. Although the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; is not the only piece of federal language law, it is the legislative keystone of Canada&#x27;s official bilingualism. It was substantially amended in 1988. Both languages are equal in Canada&#x27;s government and in all the services it controls, such as the courts.

==Summary of main features==
The &quot;Act&quot; provides, among other things,
*that Canadians have the right to receive services from federal departments and from Crown corporations in both official languages;
*that Canadians will be able to be heard before federal courts in the official language of their choice;
*that Parliament will adopt laws and to publish regulations in both official languages, and that both versions will be of equal legal weight;
*that English and French will have equal status of languages of work within the federal public service within geographically defined parts of the country that are designated bilingual (most notably in the National Capital Region, Montreal and New Brunswick), as well as in certain overseas government offices and in parts of the country where there is sufficient demand for services in both official languages. In remaining geographical areas, the language of work for federal public servants is French (in Quebec) and English (elsewhere);

The Federal government has set in place regulations establishing linguistic categories (anglophone, francophone, bilingual) for some job functions within the public service. Departments and agencies of the federal government are required to fill these positions with individuals who are capable of serving the public in English, in French, or in both languages. Unilingual public servants are given incentives to learn the other official language, and the government provides language training and offers a &quot;bilingualism bonus&quot;.

Part VI of the &quot;Act&quot; mandates that English-speaking Canadians and French-speaking Canadians not be discriminated against based on ethnic origin or first language learned when it comes to employment opportunities and advancement.

The law also created the Commissioner of Official Languages, an officer of Parliament charged with receiving complaints from the public, undertaking inquiries, and making recommendations regarding the status of the two official languages.

Section 32 of the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; authorizes the Governor in Council (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the federal cabinet) to issue regulations defining the geographic regions in which services will be offered by the federal government in the relevant minority language (English in Quebec and French elsewhere). This provides a legal definition for the otherwise vague requirement that services be provided in the minority official languages wherever there is &quot;significant demand.&quot; The definition used in the regulations is complex, but basically an area of the country is served in both languages if at least 5,000 persons in that area, or 5% of the local population (whichever is smaller), belongs to that province&#x27;s English or French linguistic minority population. The regulations were first promulgated in 1991.

==Political context==
The &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; was one of the cornerstones of the government of Pierre Trudeau. The law was an attempt to implement some of the policy objectives outlined by the federally commissioned Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, which had been established in 1963 and since that time had been issuing periodic reports on the inequitable manner in which Canada&#x27;s English-speaking and French-speaking populations were treated by the federal administration. At that time, only 9% of jobs within the federal public service were occupied by Francophones, even though French-speakers formed a quarter of the Canadian population. The proportion of jobs designated bilingual grew to 14% in 1978, and to 25% in 2004.

One of the most important features of the 1969 act was to ensure that federal government services would be provided in both official languages, wherever population size warranted it.

Its principles were later incorporated into the &quot;Constitution of Canada&quot;, in Section 16 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

A new &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; was enacted in 1988 in order to achieve two objectives.

First, it was necessary to update the 1969 law to take into account the new language-related obligations that the federal government had undertaken under Sections 16-23 of the &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which had been enacted in 1982. For example, Section 20 of the &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; guarantees the right of the Canadian public to communicate in English and French with any central government office or with regional offices where there is &quot;a significant demand for communication with and services from that office.&quot; Significant demand is not defined in the &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. One of the purposes of the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; of 1988 was to remedy this omission.

Second, the new law included provisions for the promotion by the government of Canada of Quebec&#x27;s English-speaking minority and of the French-speaking minorities in the rest of the country. The programs that fall under the &quot;promotion&quot; umbrella are often designed to encourage each provincial government to offer services to its official-language minority community, and contain a mechanism for transferring funds to the provincial governments in order to finance a part of these programs. Under Canada&#x27;s federal constitution, many important services, such as education and health, fall under provincial jurisdiction and are therefore off-limits to any direct federal spending. The transfer of federal funds, conditional upon the fulfilment by each provincial government of detailed conditions laid out in a funding agreement, is a constitutionally permitted method of dodging this jurisdictional constraint.

This would suggest that the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; and Quebec&#x27;s &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; (also known as &quot;Bill 101&quot;) are fundamentally at cross-purposes with each other. However, that perspective is not universally accepted. For example, former Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff has stated that &quot;Bill 101 and the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; are not in opposition, they are complementary.&quot;

==Reactions==

===Provincial legislatures===

In 1969, the law was adopted with all-party support in the House of Commons of Canada. Despite this, there was not universal support for the law. The premiers of the three Prairie provinces requested, early in 1969, that the Official Languages Bill be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada to determine its constitutionality. They maintained, along with JT Thorson, the former president of the Exchequer Court of Canada, that the bill was outside the powers of the Parliament of Canada. The reference to the court was never made, but the legal question was resolved in 1974, when the Supreme Court ruled, in Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick, that the subject matter of the bill was within federal jurisdiction.

In subsequent decades the response from provincial governments to the example set by the federal government has been mixed:
*New Brunswick, which is home to Canada&#x27;s second-largest French-speaking minority population, adopted the federal government policy and adopted its own &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; on April 18, 1969. The bilingual status of New Brunswick was strengthened in 1993 by the addition of section 16.1 to the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.
*Ontario, which is the home to Canada&#x27;s largest French-speaking minority, opted instead to enact a law (the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot;) which provides for services of the provincial government to be made available in certain geographically designated regions, but which does not give the French language either a symbolic or an authoritative status as an equal &quot;official&quot; language of Ontario. However, the English and French versions of statutes and regulations that are enacted or made in both languages are equally authoritative. 
*Manitoba, which is home to Canada&#x27;s third-largest French-speaking minority, refused to overturn its ban on the use of French in both the provincial legislature and its courts (which had been in effect since 1890), until it was forced to do so in 1985 by a ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada (&quot;Reference re Manitoba Language Rights&quot;) that the province was under a constitutional obligation to enact laws in French as well as in English.
*Quebec, which is home to an English-speaking minority of over half a million, had traditionally been the only province which was generous in its treatment of its minority-language population, and for this reason had been cited by the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism as the model to be emulated by other provinces. But in the 1970s, the provincial legislature adopted two laws, the &quot;Official Language Act&quot; (also known as &quot;Bill 22&quot;) and the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; (also known as &quot;Bill 101&quot;), reducing the access of Quebecers to English-language services, preventing immigrants and Francophones from enrolling their children in English schools, requiring that French be made the language of the workplace, and restricting the use of English on commercial signs.

===Public reactions===
Public support for bilingual services had dramatically increased between the mid-1960s and the end of the 1970s. There was no direct polling on the popularity of the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; itself at the time, but poll data on related questions gives an indication of a significant shift in the attitudes of English-speaking Canadians. A 1965 poll showed that 17% of Canadians living outside Quebec favored the use of public funds to finance French-language schools. This proportion had risen to 77% by 1977 (albeit in response to a slightly different question about support for provincial governments offering services in French &quot;where possible&quot;).

Within Quebec, changes to the treatment of French-speakers within the federal public service were met with approval mixed with skepticism that this actually helped the unilingual French-speaking majority of Quebecers, who continued to be excluded from all federal jobs designated &quot;bilingual&quot;, since by definition a &quot;bilingual&quot; job requires the use of English.

However, the changes found some opposition in English Canada. &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; columnist Braithwaither sums up the position of the opponents of the bill like this: &quot;We are not afraid of any aspect of the language bill, we simply regard it as unnecessary, politically-motivated, costly to implement, divisive, and, as it affects the non-English, non-French third of the population, wholly discriminatory.&quot;

As per the bill, some positions in the public sector were designated as bilingual. At the implementation of the bill, if a bilingual position was held by a unilingual anglophone, this person was allowed to keep their position on the condition that they attempted to learn French, and all subsequent holders of this position must be bilingual. Under these circumstances, there were fears that, because of the higher rate of bilingualism among Francophones, people whose first official language is French would become overrepresented in the public sector. However, this has not become the case. The ratio of French first official language speakers to English first official language speakers in the public sector is almost the same as in the general population.

At any rate, the adoption of official bilingualism at the federal level did almost nothing to slow the rise of the sovereignist movement. The nationalist Parti Québécois made its first significant electoral breakthrough less than a year after the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; was adopted, winning 23% of the vote in Quebec&#x27;s 1970 provincial election and replacing the Union Nationale as the main electoral vehicle for Quebec nationalism. Six years later, the Parti Québécois came to power in the 1976 provincial election.

== Failure to implement all provisions of the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; ==
From time to time, the Official Languages Commissioner draws attention to the fact that federal agencies subject to the law are failing to live up to their legal obligations regarding official languages. In a report published in 2004 on the 35th anniversary of the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot;, Commissioner Dyane Adam noted that only 86% of posts designated &quot;bilingual&quot; in the federal public service were occupied by persons who had effectively mastered the two official languages. This nevertheless was an increase over the comparable figure of 1978, when only 70% of the incumbents in posts that had been designated &quot;bilingual&quot; were capable of speaking both languages at accepted levels.

== Opinion polls ==

According to a poll conducted in 2002, 98% of Quebecers consider official bilingualism to be &quot;very important&quot; or &quot;somewhat important&quot;. This proportion drops to 76% in the Atlantic provinces, 72% in Ontario, 67% in the Prairie provinces, and 63% in British Columbia. Another poll, conducted in 2000, shows that more than half of Canadians outside Quebec believe that too much effort has gone into promoting bilingualism. By contrast, only 26% of Quebecers shared this view. A poll conducted in 2012 found that 63% of Canadians were in favour of bilingualism for all of Canada, a 9% increase since that same poll was last conducted in 2003.

In 2016, another poll was conducted, showing increasing support for official bilingualism in every province. Among telephone respondents, 88% of Canadians said they &quot;strongly support&quot; or &quot;somewhat support&quot; the aims of the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot;: 91% in the Atlantic, 94% in Quebec, 87% in Ontario, 83% in the Prairies, 90% in Alberta and 84% in British Columbia. 84% of telephone respondents also said they personally &quot;strongly support&quot; or &quot;somewhat support&quot; official bilingualism. The results were more mixed in the online portion of the poll, where 78% of respondents said they &quot;strongly support&quot; or &quot;somewhat support&quot; the aims of the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot;, and 73% said they personally &quot;strongly support&quot; or &quot;somewhat support&quot; official bilingualism. In another poll conducted on this topic in the same year, 67% of respondents across Canada answered &quot;yes&quot; to the question &quot;Are you personally in favour of bilingualism for all of Canada?&quot; while 31% said &quot;no&quot;.

== Reform proposals ==

=== 2021 OLA modernisation bill ===
In June 2021 the Government of Canada introduced a parliamentary bill to modernize the Official Languages Act in a changing and more digital society.

=== Bill C-13 ===
In 2022, the Government of Canada tabled Bill C-13 which amends the Official Languages Act and other related legislation. As of June 15, 2023, Bill C-13 passed third reading in the Senate and is awaiting royal assent.

=== Including more languages ===
The Official Languages Act applies to English and French, but does not include formal protections any other languages spoken in Canada, Indigenous or otherwise. In a Winnipeg allocution during his first term, Pierre Elliott Trudeau said that French was selected as an official language mostly because of the important demographic weight within Canada. As such, if and when Ukrainian would represent the mother tongue of, say, 10% of the population, Trudeau assured the crowd that steps would be taken to make Ukrainian an official language of Canada as well.

More recently, Romeo Saganash, the NDP Member of Parliament for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou from 2011 to 2019, proposed that every single indigenous languages still spoken today become an official language of Canada. Saganash also advocates for the right to speak indigenous languages in the House of Commons and the Senate.

<text>The World Squash Championships are squash events, which since the early 1990s have been held annually for both men and women organised by the Professional Squash Association. The men&#x27;s event was first held in 1976 in London, England and the women&#x27;s was inaugurated in 1976 in Brisbane, Australia.

==Overview==
The British Open had for many years been generally considered to be the sport&#x27;s effective world championship, and this continued to be the case until the World Open (now called World Championship) was established. 

The women&#x27;s World Championship was held once every two years until the early 1990s, when it became an annual event. The men&#x27;s event has been held every year since 1976, except for a two-year gap in 2000 and 2001 when it was not held due primarily to difficulties in securing sponsorship. In recent years, the men&#x27;s World Championship has been part of the PSA World Series.

<doc id="466605" wikidata="Q2846779" url="?curid=466605" title="Ender Wiggin">
<text>Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin is a fictional character from Orson Scott Card&#x27;s 1985 science fiction novel &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; and its sequels (&quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, &quot;Xenocide&quot;, &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;, &quot;Ender in Exile&quot;), as well as in the first part of the spin-off series, &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot;. The book series itself is an expansion of Card&#x27;s 1977 short story &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game.&quot;

In the 2013 film adaptation of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, Ender is portrayed by Asa Butterfield.

==&quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;==
In the first book of the series, &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, Ender is the youngest and most well-rounded of three children; his parents received permission to have a third child, which is rare because of the state&#x27;s strict two-child policy. His existence was called for by a program aiming at producing commanders for humanity&#x27;s war against the Formics, or &quot;Buggers.&quot; 

Ender is bullied at school for being a &quot;Third,&quot; particularly by a bully named Stilson. After Stilson engages him in a fight, Ender beats him up so severely that the boy is hospitalized and subsequently dies, although Ender does not learn of this until much later. Ender is tormented by his brother Peter, a sadist, who resents the attention Ender gets from the military. His sister, Valentine, is his protector and only friend. When he is accepted into Battle School, he is brokenhearted at leaving her, but she assures him that they will always have a bond.

Battle School is an Earth-orbiting space station that trains and evaluates military child prodigies, with the goal of finding the leader they need to win the war. Ender is exposed to significant emotional anguish and physical danger, but it soon becomes clear that he is an exceptional individual, even among the elite students. Ender excels in academics, his main interest being a team-based three-dimensional laser tag competition in the zero-g Battle Room. He becomes a masterly player and strategist, and is eventually assigned command of Dragon Army. He molds this group of unwanted students into the most successful army in the history of the school.

Ender&#x27;s unprecedented success engenders his fellow commanders&#x27; jealousy, who subject him to torment. The lead bully, Bonzo, attempts to kill Ender in the shower, but fails. Ender kills Bonzo without knowing it. 

With time running short, he is transferred directly to Command School on Eros, bypassing other schools Battle School graduates would normally attend. There he trains in interstellar fleet combat with holographic simulators. After Ender masters the game, it changes from one with direct control of ships to one where he relays commands to his classmates from Battle School: Julian &quot;Bean&quot; Delphiki, Alai, Shen, Petra Arkanian, Dink Meeker, Crazy Tom, Hot Soup, Fly Molo, Vlad, Dumper, and Carn Carby. Under the tutelage of Mazer Rackham, the legendary savior of humanity in the previous war, Ender and his trusted companions take on a grueling series of ever more difficult battle simulations and emerge victorious every time.

The final battle takes place above a planet against an enemy with an overwhelming numerical superiority. Ender perceives this as an unfair test and resolves to break the rules. Worn down almost the point of breaking, he thinks this will convince his instructors that he is not the person to lead the Fleet into battle against the Formics. Instead of fighting a hopeless battle against the enemy, Ender orders his squadron leaders to conduct a series of seemingly purposeless skirmishes. The enemy does not realize until too late that Ender&#x27;s fleet is gradually drawing closer to the planet. When Ender&#x27;s surviving ships are close enough, he sends them to destroy the planet itself using Doctor Device, a weapon that destroys matter, but only if it is concentrated enough. Only a few ships manage to get close enough, but they destroy the planet. Afterwards, he is told that it was not a simulation; he and his classmates had been unknowingly issuing orders to real ships in real battles. The last battle destroyed the Bugger homeworld and eradicated the Bugger species. Ender is hailed as a hero, but he is stricken with guilt for having unknowingly committed speciocide.

His subordinates are returned to Earth to their various home countries, but Ender is too potent for any one country to have. War would break out over him. So, Peter, who is becoming a major political force on Earth, brokers a deal in which his brother is sent into permanent exile. Ender journeys with his sister Valentine to one of the colonies being established on the now-abandoned Bugger worlds. Once there, he discovers a fertilized pupa of a Queen Bugger, hidden in a place that the Buggers designed for him to discover by modeling it to resemble part of an interactive computer game he played during his years in Battle School, which they found out during his dreams of them in Command School. The pupal Queen is capable of restoring the Bugger species. Through rudimentary telepathic communication with the Queen, he learns that the entire conflict had been a mistake arising from the inability of the two species to establish communication with each other. He also learns from the Queen that the Buggers regretted having mistakenly fought humans and forgive Ender for destroying their world. Ender promises to find the Queen a home to reestablish her people in safety.

Ender writes a book anonymously called &quot;The Hive Queen&quot;, which tells the story of the war from the Formic perspective and starts to change public opinion of him. Peter, who has become the Hegemon, the head of the world government on Earth, recognizes Ender as the author and asks him to write a second work, about him. Ender authors &quot;The Hegemon&quot;. The two books become very influential, and eventually they are always published together. Ender and Valentine begin to search for a planet where the Queen can restore her race.

==&quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;==
&quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; begins 3000 years after the events of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; and the Xenocide. Ender is departing from the planet where Valentine has found a husband. He has acquired an integrated computer by which he communicates with a powerful sentient program known as Jane. She reveals herself only to Ender. He has taken the role of Speaker for the Dead, keeping his real identity a secret. A Speaker for the Dead volunteers to try to make sense of the life of a deceased individual for the bereaved. Thanks to his portrayal of himself in his books, &quot;The Hive Queen&quot; and &quot;The Hegemon&quot;, Ender is despised as a xenocide: the killer of an entire intelligent species.

Ender departs for the planet Lusitania, where a request has been made to speak on behalf of a researcher who has died from contact with the planet&#x27;s indigenous species, the piggies. When he arrives at the planet 22 years later (relativity having aged him less than two weeks), he finds that the original call for a Speaker has been rescinded. Two other requests, however, have been made to speak for more recent deaths. Ender discovers that both calls originated from the same family; the first from Novinha&#x27;s daughter Ela, requesting someone speak for the death of Novinha&#x27;s husband Marcos, and the second from Novinha&#x27;s eldest son Miro, who has asked for a speaker for the researcher Libo.

Ender begins to investigate Marcos and has frequent contact with Novinha&#x27;s family. His approach endears him to most of the children as a father figure. He discovers that Marcos was abusive to his wife. While in dialogue with the Children of the Mind, the planet&#x27;s religious monastic order, he is annoyed by Jane&#x27;s commentary and turns off his connection to her. Jane, without consulting Ender, sends incriminating reports to the interstellar authorities, who order the arrest of Miro and Ouanda, the researchers who have been investigating the piggies. The colony&#x27;s charter is canceled, and the colonists are forced to rely on Ender for guidance.

Meanwhile, Ender has been receiving pressure from the Hive-Queen&#x27;s pupa to allow her to settle on this world because she has been in telepathic contact with another race. Ender assumes this race is the piggies, although they seem simple and not telepathic. After the sanctions are put in place, he gets Miro and Ouanda to allow him to visit the piggies, who have been asking to meet him, the &quot;original Speaker&quot;. Ender admits to being the original Speaker. The piggies demonstrate that the trees they grow from the corpses of those who have been ritually killed is their reproductive stage. The ritual killings of the two xenologers were misunderstandings; the piggies were under the false impression that humans reproduced in a fashion similar to themselves.

Ender &quot;speaks&quot; for Marcos and reveals many secrets, mostly Novinha&#x27;s. Foremost among them is that Marcos was incapable of having children, and Novinha&#x27;s children are offspring of Libo. This means that Miro&#x27;s girlfriend Ouanda is his half-sister. Ender recommends that the colony declare itself in rebellion to sanctions from the Intergalactic Congress. He re-establishes contact with Jane, who masks their ansible signal.

He enters into a relationship with Novinha. Valentine agrees to travel to the colony. On the far side of the planet, he has discovered a site reminiscent of a dream he had in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;. With her guidance, he plants the Hive-Queen&#x27;s pupa in preparation for the rebirth of the Formics.

==&quot;Xenocide&quot;==
During the events of &quot;Xenocide&quot;, Ender is looked to as an unofficial leader by the rebel colony of Lusitania. He is helping Novinha protect humans from the descolada virus. Descolada is fatal to humans, but is essential for the piggies&#x27; life and reproduction. The Formics have an immune system that is advanced enough to protect them, and the humans have been using anti-viral dietary supplements, but both defenses are starting to fade in the face of the virus&#x27; mutations. Ender is also attempting to keep the peace on planet between the three species. The humans resent the piggies for being the reason they can&#x27;t kill the descolada virus outright. The existence of the new Formic colony is not general knowledge, but Ender knows that their appearance and their non-human way of reasoning would cause friction with the humans. Novinha&#x27;s youngest children Grego, a rabble-rouser among the humans, and Quara, who sees the virus as sentient and is bringing up objections to the research her mother and sister are doing, are troublesome. The piggies and the Formics are worried about the approaching human fleet, which may destroy the planet if the descolada virus is unleashed on humanity.

Research ordered by the government on another planet, Path, leads a young genius, Han Qing-jao, to deduce the existence of Jane, who is tied to the ansible system. Jane reveals herself to Qing-jao in an effort to prevent her from informing the authorities by telling her that the OCD her people suffer from was governmentally orchestrated. However, the report to the authorities is still dispatched and the government enacts a plan to temporarily deactivate the ansible network to purge Jane from the system. 
Qing-jao&#x27;s father agrees to help with the descolada problem regardless of his daughter&#x27;s actions, in exchange for a cure for the OCD that plagues them. The Lusitanian researchers agree, but though a cure is designed, it proves impossible to synthesize; they can&#x27;t cure the OCD without removing the genius as well, and the counter for the descolada won&#x27;t be created. Meanwhile, they deduce that Jane has the power to pull any object she knows about in great detail outside the known universe, where conscious thought has physical power.

Ender goes on the first test flight, because Jane&#x27;s existence was a direct result of his time at the Battle School; therefore, Jane is most likely to be able to keep Ender&#x27;s form in her mind. Since Ender has passed Jane off to Miro due to the previous misunderstanding in &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, Miro must go as well. Ela goes because she is the only one with enough knowledge to produce the needed viruses. The test flight occurs with unexpected side effects. Ela produces the new viruses, but Miro also gives himself a new undamaged body. Ender inadvertently creates copies of his brother and sister from his memories. They are more based on those memories than reality; therefore, Valentine is very soft and loving, and Peter is purely evil. Horrified, Ender removes himself from further efforts so as to not risk creating more things like his pseudo-siblings.

==&quot;Children of the Mind&quot;==
&quot;Children of the Mind&quot; begins where &quot;Xenocide&quot; left off. Ender&#x27;s story revolves around his &quot;pseudo-offspring&quot; Peter and young Val. Ender&#x27;s life force is now split between three different people. Throughout the book, Ender has a difficult time maintaining a force strong enough for all three people to live. The maximum number of people Ender can keep alive and healthy at any given time is two. In the beginning young Val suffers the most, because Ender is the least interested in her mission, until it is revealed that she, along with Miro and Jane, are looking for the home planet of the descolada virus. Peter never has to compete for Ender&#x27;s life force because Ender is interested in Peter&#x27;s mission to prevent the Lusitania fleet from using the Molecular Disruption Device on Lusitania. When Ender is fully invested in Peter and young Val, Ender himself begins to deteriorate. This causes Ender to collapse while working in the monastery garden, falling in and out of consciousness for the remainder of the book until his death. Ender&#x27;s physical manifestation is gone, but his life force continues through Peter (young Val gives up her physical manifestation for Jane and her life force continues through Peter as well).

==&quot;Ender in Exile&quot;==
A book that chronicles the lost years between &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; and &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, &quot;Ender in Exile&quot; tells of Ender&#x27;s initial set-off from Eros, the long journey to the first colony, Shakespeare, as well as his trip to the colony of Ganges. The court-martial of Hyrum Graff is expanded upon; some light is shed on Graff&#x27;s life after he was made Minister of Colonization, as well as Mazer Rackham&#x27;s travels after the Formic War. After defeating the Formics, Ender remains on Eros.

Throughout the voyage to Shakespeare, Admiral Morgan attempts to usurp Ender&#x27;s lawful position as Governor of Shakespeare. Dorabella seduces Admiral Morgan and tries to use her daughter, Alessandra, to seduce Ender, hoping that, through her own marriage to Morgan and Alessandra&#x27;s to Ender, Morgan can rule Shakespeare using Ender as a puppet.

Upon arrival at Shakespeare, Ender easily crushes Morgan&#x27;s attempted coup, with help from Hyrum Graff back on Earth. Ender liberates Alessandra from her mother. After two years as governor, and after completing &quot;The Hive Queen&quot; and &quot;The Hegemon&quot;, Ender convinces Valentine to move on.

Ender&#x27;s first stop, at the request of Hyrum Graff, is the Hindu colony of Ganges, which is governed by Virlomi, a former Battle School student who caused an uprising in India before she was subdued and exiled by Peter Wiggin&#x27;s Hegemony. Once there, Ender agrees to help Virlomi quell an uprising by a group called the Natives of Ganges, led by a young man named Randall Firth, who is under the delusion that he is the son of Achilles de Flandres. They have adopted &quot;The Hive Queen&quot; as a rallying cry, and have begun to belittle the name of Ender Wiggin, coining the phrase &quot;Ender the Xenocide&quot;.
Ender and Randall engage in physical combat, which leaves Ender near death. Ender reveals Randall&#x27;s true parentage (two of Ender&#x27;s old friends and squadron commanders, Julian &#x27;Bean&#x27; Delphiki and Petra Arkanian Delphiki Wiggin), after which Randall renounces his secret name, Achilles, and renames himself Arkanian Delphiki. Ender reunites Randall and his mother by way of the ansible.

<text>The Königsburg is a ruined medieval castle southeast of Königshütte, a village in the borough of Oberharz am Brocken, in Harz district in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt.

== Site ==
The ruins are located above the confluence of the Warme Bode and Kalte Bode rivers in the Harz Mountains in central Germany. They lie at a height of 460 metres above sea level on the edge of a wooded plateau and offer a good view of the Wurmberg and the Brocken, the highest mountains in Lower Saxony and the Harz respectively.

== History ==
In 1312 the site is first mentioned in the records as &quot;castrum Königshof&quot; when Bishop Albrecht von Halberstadt purchased the castle from Knappen Heinrich von Botvelde. In 1324 there is another mention of it as &quot;castrum Köningshof acqisivit&quot;, then all went quiet until it is described in 1709 for the first time as &quot;Königsburg&quot;. At that time it had already fallen into ruins.

When Paul Höfer carried out extensive excavations in the years from 1898 to 1901, he assumed he had discovered the long sought after palace (&quot;Pfalz&quot;) of Bodfeld and produced several publications about it.

In 1931, Carl Schuchhardt suggested, through advances in soil research, that this was incorrect and, a little later, this was confirmed by Paul Grimm, who was able to establish that the finds, especially the pottery, were not older than the 13th century. Although the results of this research from the 1930s have been consistently acknowledged within the scientific community, Königshütte still advertises today that the Königsburg is the Bodfeld hunting palace and one of the most significant historical sites in the Harz.

== Site and hiking ==
Only remnants of the &quot;bergfried&quot; and several ditches and ramparts bear witness to the former castle. The ruins of the Königsburg are incorporated as No. 41 into the system of the checkpoints in the Harzer Wandernadel.

<text>Henry Joseph Darger Jr. ( ; April 12, 1892 – April 13, 1973) was an American writer, novelist and artist who worked as a hospital custodian in Chicago, Illinois. He has become famous for his posthumously recovered 15,145-page manuscript for a fantasy novel titled &quot;In the Realms of the Unreal&quot;, along with several hundred drawings and watercolor illustrations for the story and two further works of literature.

The visual subject matter of his work ranges from idyllic scenes in Edwardian interiors and tranquil flowered landscapes populated by children and fantastic creatures, to scenes of horrific terror and carnage depicting young children being tortured and massacred. Much of his artwork is mixed media with collage elements. Darger&#x27;s artwork has become one of the most celebrated examples of outsider art.

==Life==
Darger was born on April 12, 1892, in Chicago, Illinois, to Henry Darger Sr., a German immigrant from Meldorf, and Rosa Fullman. Cook County records show he was born at home, located at 350 W. 24th Street. When he was four years old, his mother died of puerperal fever after giving birth to a daughter, who was given up for adoption; Darger never knew his sister. One of his biographers, the art historian and psychologist John M. MacGregor, discovered that Rosa had two children before Henry, but did not discover their whereabouts.

By Darger&#x27;s own account, his father was kind and reassuring to him. Darger Sr. was a tailor with disabilities, and his poor health made caring for his son difficult. They lived together until 1900, when his father was taken to St. Augustine&#x27;s Home for the Aged. Because of his apparent intellect, the young Darger had been enrolled in public school at the third grade level; after his father&#x27;s hospitalization, Darger was moved to the Mission of Our Lady of Mercy, a Roman Catholic orphanage. After bad behavior, he was relocated to the Illinois Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children in Lincoln, Illinois, also called the Lincoln State School (later changed to the Lincoln Developmental Center before its closure in 2002), with the diagnosis, according to Stephen Prokopoff, that &quot;little Henry&#x27;s heart is not in the right place&quot;. According to John MacGregor, the diagnosis was actually &quot;self-abuse&quot;, a euphemism for masturbation.

Darger himself felt that much of his problem was being able to see through adult lies and becoming a &quot;smart-aleck&quot; as a result, which often led to his being punished by teachers and ganged up on by classmates. He also felt compelled to make unusual noises. The Lincoln asylum&#x27;s practices included forced child labor and severe punishments, which Darger would later seemingly incorporate into his writing. Darger later said that, to be fair, there were also &quot;good times&quot; at the asylum, he enjoyed some of the work, and he had friends as well as enemies.

In 1908, Darger received word that his father had died in St. Augustine&#x27;s Home for the Aged; Darger never had a chance to visit him since his departure eight years prior. He attempted to escape in 1908 by freight train, but was thwarted by police after reaching Chicago and forced back into the asylum. He escaped once more in 1909 and succeeded, now free in Chicago.

With the help of his godmother, Darger found menial employment in a Catholic hospital and in this fashion continued to support himself until his retirement in 1963.

Except for a brief stint in the U.S. Army during World War I, his life took on a pattern that seems to have varied little. A devout Catholic, he attended Mass daily, frequently returning for as many as five services. He collected found objects from the streets – including shoes, eyeglasses, and balls of string – to exhibit alongside artwork in his home-studio. His dress was shabby, although he attempted to keep his clothes clean and mended, and he was largely solitary.

His close friend of 48 years, William Schloeder, was of like mind on the subject of protecting abused and neglected children, and the pair proposed founding a &quot;Children&#x27;s Protective Society&quot; that would put such children up for adoption to loving families. Schloeder left Chicago sometime in the mid-1930s, but he and Darger stayed in touch through letters until Schloeder&#x27;s death in 1959. Darger&#x27;s biographer Jim Elledge states it is heavily implied by Darger in his own writing that he and Schloeder had a romantic relationship while Schloeder lived in Chicago; Darger referred to Schloeder as his &quot;special friend&quot; on many occasions.

In 1930, Darger settled into a second-floor room on Chicago&#x27;s North Side at 851 West Webster Avenue in the Lincoln Park section of the city, near the DePaul University campus. It was in this room for the next 43 years that Darger would imagine and write his massive tomes (in addition to a 10-year daily weather journal and assorted diaries) and collect and display artwork until his death at St. Augustine&#x27;s Home for the Aged (the same institution at which his father had died) on April 13, 1973, one day after his 81st birthday.

In the last entry in his diary, Darger wrote: &quot;January 1, 1971. I had a very poor nothing like Christmas. Never had a good Christmas all my life, nor a good new year, and now... I am very bitter but fortunately not revengeful, though I feel should be how I am...&quot;

Darger is buried at All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines, Illinois, in a plot called &quot;The Old People of the Little Sisters of the Poor Plot&quot;. His headstone is inscribed &quot;Artist&quot; and &quot;Protector of Children&quot;.

==Works==
===&quot;In the Realms of the Unreal&quot;===
&quot;In the Realms of the Unreal&quot; is a 15,145-page work bound in fifteen immense, densely typed volumes (with three of them consisting of several hundred illustrations, scroll-like watercolor paintings on paper derived from magazines and coloring books) created over six decades. Darger illustrated his stories using a technique of traced images cut from magazines and catalogues, arranged in large panoramic landscapes and painted in watercolors, some as large as 30 feet wide and painted on both sides. He wrote himself into the narrative as the children&#x27;s protector.

The largest part of the book, &quot;The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion&quot;, follows the adventures of the daughters of Robert Vivian, seven princesses of the Christian nation of Abbieannia who assist a daring rebellion against the child slavery imposed by John Manley and the Glandelinians. Children take up arms in their own defense and are often slain in battle or viciously tortured by the Glandelinian overlords. The elaborate mythology includes the setting of a large planet, around which Earth orbits as a moon (where most people are Christian and mostly Catholic), and a species called the &quot;Blengigomeneans&quot; (or Blengins for short), gigantic winged beings with curved horns who occasionally take human or part-human form, even disguising themselves as children. They are usually benevolent, but some Blengins are extremely suspicious of all humans, due to Glandelinian atrocities.

Once released from the Lincoln asylum, Darger repeatedly attempted to adopt a child, but his efforts failed. Images of children often served as his inspiration, particularly a portrait from the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; from May 9, 1911: a five-year-old murder victim, named Elsie Paroubek. The girl had left home on April 8 of that year telling her mother she was going to visit her aunt around the corner from her home. She was last seen listening to an organ grinder with her cousins. Her body was found a month later in a sanitary district channel near the screen guards of the powerhouse at Lockport. An autopsy found she had probably been suffocated—not strangled, as is often stated in articles about Darger. Paroubek&#x27;s disappearance and murder, her funeral, and the subsequent investigation, were the subjects of a huge amount of coverage in the &quot;Daily News&quot; and other papers at the time.

This newspaper photo was part of a growing personal archive of clippings Darger had been gathering. There is no indication that the murder or the news photo and article had any particular significance for Darger, until one day he could not find it. Writing in his journal at the time, he began to process this forfeiture of yet another child, lamenting that &quot;the huge disaster and calamity&quot; of his loss &quot;will never be atoned for&quot;, but &quot;shall be avenged to the uttermost limit&quot;. According to his autobiography, Darger believed the photo was among several items that were stolen when his locker at work was broken into. He never found his copy of the photograph again. Because he could not remember the exact date of its publication, he could not locate it in the newspaper archive. He carried out an elaborate series of novenas and other prayers for the picture to be returned. The fictive war that was sparked by Darger&#x27;s loss of the newspaper photograph of Paroubek, whose killer was never found, became Darger&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;. He had been working on some version of the novel before this time (he makes reference to an early draft which was also lost or stolen), but now it became an all-consuming creation.

In &quot;The Realms of the Unreal&quot;, Paroubek is imagined as Annie Aronburg, the leader of the first child slave rebellion. &quot;The assassination of the child labor rebel Annie Aronburg... was the most shocking child murder ever caused by the Glandelinian Government&quot; and was the cause of the war. Through their sufferings, valiant deeds and exemplary holiness, the Vivian Girls are hoped to be able to help bring about a triumph of Christianity. Darger provided two endings to the story, one in which the Vivian Girls and Christianity are triumphant and another in which they are defeated and the godless Glandelinians reign.

Darger&#x27;s human figures were rendered largely by tracing, collage, or photo enlargement from popular magazines and children&#x27;s books (much of the &quot;trash&quot; he collected was old magazines and newspapers, which he clipped for source material). Some of his favorite figures were the Coppertone Girl and Little Annie Rooney. He is praised for his natural gift for composition and the brilliant use of color in his watercolors. The images of daring escapes, mighty battles, and painful torture are reminiscent not only of contemporaneous epic films such as &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (which Darger might easily have seen) but of events in Catholic history; the text makes it clear that the child victims are heroic martyrs like the early saints. Art critic Michael Moon explains Darger&#x27;s images of tortured children in terms of popular Catholic culture and iconography. These included martyr pageants and Catholic comic books with detailed, often gory tales of innocent female victims.

One idiosyncratic feature of Darger&#x27;s artwork is that his girl subjects are shown to have penises when unclothed or partially clothed. Darger biographer Jim Elledge speculates that this represents a reflection of Darger&#x27;s own childhood issues with sexual identity and homosexuality. Darger&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Crazy House&quot;, deals with these subjects more explicitly. However this may simply reflect Darger&#x27;s lack of knowledge of anatomy as girls are always depicted either with no genitalia at all, or with penises.

In a paraphrase of the Declaration of Independence, Darger wrote of children&#x27;s right &quot;to play, to be happy, and to dream, the right to normal sleep of the night&#x27;s season, the right to an education, that we may have an equality of opportunity for developing all that are in us of mind and heart.&quot;

===&quot;Crazy House: Further Adventures in Chicago&quot;===
A second work of fiction, provisionally titled &quot;Crazy House: Further Adventures in Chicago&quot;, contains over 10,000 handwritten pages. Written after &quot;The Realms&quot;, it takes that epic&#x27;s major characters—the seven Vivian sisters and their companion/secret brother, Penrod—and places them in Chicago, with the action unfolding during the same years as that of the earlier book. Begun in 1939, it is a tale of a house that is possessed by demons and haunted by ghosts, or has an evil consciousness of its own. Children disappear into the house and are later found brutally murdered. The Vivians and Penrod are sent to investigate and discover that the murders are the work of evil ghosts. The girls go about exorcising the place, but have to resort to arranging for a full-scale Holy Mass to be held in each room before the house is clean. They do this repeatedly, but it never works. The narrative ends mid-scene, with Darger having just been rescued from the Crazy House.

===&quot;The History of My Life&quot;===
In 1968, Darger became interested in tracing some of his frustrations back to his childhood and began writing &quot;The History of My Life&quot;. Spanning eight volumes, the book only spends 206 pages detailing Darger&#x27;s early life before veering off into 4,672 pages of fiction about a powerful tornado called &quot;Sweetie Pie&quot;, probably inspired by memories of a tornado he had witnessed in 1908.

==Posthumous fame and influence==
Darger&#x27;s landlords, Nathan and Kiyoko Lerner, discovered his work shortly before his death. Nathan Lerner, an accomplished photographer whose long career, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;was inextricably bound up in the history of visual culture in Chicago,&quot; immediately recognized the artistic merit of Darger&#x27;s work. By this time Darger was in St. Augustine&#x27;s, operated by the Little Sisters of the Poor, where his father had died.

The Lerners took charge of the Darger estate, publicizing his work and contributing to projects such as the 2004 documentary &quot;In the Realms of the Unreal&quot;. In cooperation with Kiyoko Lerner, dedicated the Henry Darger Room Collection in 2008 as part of its permanent collection. Darger has become internationally recognized thanks to the efforts of the people who salvaged his work. After Nathan Lerner&#x27;s death in 1997, Kiyoko Lerner became the sole figure in charge of both her husband&#x27;s and Darger&#x27;s estates. The U.S. copyright representative for the Estate of Henry Darger and the Estate of Nathan Lerner is the Artists Rights Society.

Darger is today one of the most famous figures in the history of outsider art. At the Outsider Art Fair, held every January in New York City, and at auction, his work is among the highest-priced of any self-taught artist. The American Folk Art Museum in New York opened a Henry Darger Study Center in 2001. His work now commands upwards of $750,000.

Darger left no will and no immediate surviving relatives when he died in 1973. In 2021, Ron Slattery, a photographer who had lost the rights to photographs by Vivian Maier after her distant heirs were uncovered, read a law article questioning Kiyoko Lerner&#x27;s legal right to Darger&#x27;s artwork. He located Darger&#x27;s legal heirs by himself and notified them of their legal claim. In June 2022, a probate judge agreed to make one of the distant relatives, Christen Sadowski, &quot;the supervised administrators of the estate,&quot; making him &quot;authorized to take possession of and collect the assets of the Estate, including its copyright and personal property interests.&quot; The estate immediately sued Kiyoko Lerner for control of the artworks. In March 2023, Lerner&#x27;s motion to dismiss was denied on multiple grounds, and as of April 2023 the lawsuit is currently proceeding.

==Collections and exhibits==
Darger&#x27;s works are included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the American Folk Art Museum in New York, Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Collection de l&#x27;art brut, the Walker Art Center, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, High Museum of Art, Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne, Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de Paris, Lille Métropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art in Villeneuve d&#x27;Ascq, and the Museum of Old and New Art, in Tasmania; Australia.

Darger&#x27;s art also has been featured in many notable museum exhibitions, including &quot;The Unreality of Being&quot; exhibit curated by Stephen Prokopoff. It was also seen in &quot;Disasters of War&quot; (P.S. 1, New York, 2000), where it was presented alongside prints from the famous Francisco Goya series &quot;The Disasters of War&quot; and works derived from these by the British contemporary-art duo Jake and Dinos Chapman. Darger&#x27;s work has also been shown at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Setagaya Art Museum, and the Collection de l&#x27;art brut, La Maison Rouge, Museum Kunstpalast, Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de Lille-Métropole, and the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.

In 2008, the exhibition at the American Folk Art Museum, titled &quot;Dargerism: Contemporary Artists and Henry Darger&quot;, examined the influence of Darger&#x27;s &quot;œuvre&quot; on 11 artists, including Trenton Doyle Hancock, Robyn O&#x27;Neil and Amy Cutler, who were responding not only to the aesthetic nature of Darger&#x27;s mythic work – with its tales of good versus evil, its epic scope and complexity, and its transgressive undertone – but also to his driven work ethic and all-consuming devotion to artmaking.

Also in 2008, , in Chicago, opened its permanent exhibit of the Henry Darger Room Collection, an installation that meticulously recreates the small northside Chicago apartment where Darger lived and made his art.

<text>The United Farmers of Ontario (UFO) was an agrarian and populist provincial political party in Ontario, Canada. It was the Ontario provincial branch of the United Farmers movement of the early part of the 20th century.

==History==

===Foundation and rise (1914–1919)===

The UFO was founded in 1914 by the union of various farmers&#x27; organizations that had been created over the previous fifteen years. James J. Morrison was the leading figure in the party, serving as its general secretary and secretary of the United Farmers Co-operative Company Ltd. (the purchasing co-operative the UFO operated on behalf of its members). The organization grew rapidly and by 1917 it had 350 local clubs and 12,000 members. The UFO had a comprehensive farmer&#x27;s platform that called for the nationalization of railways, progressive taxation, and legislation that would facilitate the operation of co-operatives. In 1917, supporters of the UFO formed the Farmers&#x27; Publishing Company and purchased &quot;The Weekly Sun&quot; renaming it &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Sun&quot; to act as the organ of the UFO.

The UFO entered politics by contesting and winning a by-election in Manitoulin in 1918, in which Beniah Bowman was elected as the party&#x27;s first Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). In the 1919 provincial election, with over 50,000 members, the party sought to hold the balance of power so it could introduce legislation friendly to farmers. It co-operated with the Independent Labour Party with the two organizations not running candidates against each other - the UFO contested rural ridings and the ILP stood candidates in urban areas. In total there were 64 UFO candidates, 20 ILP candidates and 10 Farmer-Labour candidates in the 1919 provincial election. The UFO platform called for the abolition of political patronage, better educational opportunities in rural areas, cheap electric power, conservation of forests, proportional representation and &quot;direct legislation&quot;. The UFO also favoured prohibition and budgetary restraint, two platform planks that were at odds with the views of urban Labour supporters. To the shock of everyone, including itself, it won 45 seats and formed a coalition government with the support of Labour MLAs in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario despite having no leader.

As the United Farmers began as a single-issue party, Morrison opposed forming a government, believing that the party should concern itself solely with agricultural issues and that it would not be able to represent the entire province. Furthermore, he viewed the Independent Labour Party as inimical to farmers&#x27; interests and opposed a coalition with them to form a majority government. Morrison was offered the position of UFO caucus leader and Premier of Ontario following the election but declined as did Sir Adam Beck; the position instead went Ernest C. Drury.

=== Government of Ontario (1919–1923) ===
Despite Morrison&#x27;s objections, the UFO joined with other MLAs to form a coalition government. He had the UFO join with 10 Independent Labour Party MLAs (an 11th ILP MLA, Morrison MacBride, broke with his colleagues and sat in Opposition). Three Independent MLAs also joined the coalition government. Drury was Premier and two of the ILP MLAs were in the cabinet.

The government under Drury tried to be a &quot;people&#x27;s government&quot; rather than a &quot;class government.&quot; Drury himself called for the coalition government to be termed a &quot;People&#x27;s Party.&quot;

Drury&#x27;s Farmer-Labour government created the first Department of Welfare for the province and brought in allowances for widows and children, a minimum wage for women and standardized adoption procedures. His government also expanded Ontario Hydro and promoted rural electrification. It created the Province of Ontario Savings Office - a provincially owned bank that lent money to farmers at a lower rate, along the lines of &quot;Social credit&quot;.

It began the first major reforestation program in North America, and began construction of the modern highway system. The government was also a strict enforcer of temperance measures, Prohibition being law in Ontario from 1916 to 1927. Drury also arranged for a grant for then-unknown researchers Frederick Banting and Charles Best who, with Dr. James Collip, later discovered insulin.

The UFO grew quickly to 1,500 clubs and 60,000 members by 1920.

Drury argued for a &quot;broadening out&quot; of the party to include labour and others, but in so doing, alienated some hard-line Farmers. Morrison, the general secretary of the UFO, remained outside of the legislature and government. Morrison opposed a number of the coalition&#x27;s initiatives, perceiving the UFO&#x27;s actions as a broad-based Progressive government rather than a &quot;class-based&quot; United Farmer government and believed that the party should not be in government but should hold the balance of power in order to force the government of the day to pass pro-farmer legislation.

The UFO government clashed with the UFO organization (led by James J. Morrison), which eventually withdrew its support from the government. However, when the 1923 election came around, the UFO received 200,000 votes, down by 50,000 compared to the previous election. This was actually a higher percentage of votes cast than it had taken in 1919 as the 1923 election suffered from low turn-out.

By the time another election came around, in 1923, the economy had improved, in part due to the government&#x27;s decisions. The Drury government lost most of their seats in the election of 1923. Seventeen United Farmer and four Labour members returned to the Legislature, compared to 75 Conservatives. Drury lost his own seat.

=== Decline (1923–1929) ===

Though the United Farmers of Ontario remained the second largest party in the legislature, they were denied Official Opposition status by Conservative premier Howard Ferguson. The position was instead given to the Liberals with W.E.N. Sinclair as Leader of the Opposition, despite the party having three fewer seats than the UFO. Morrison had announced that the UFO would be withdrawing from politics, which Ferguson had used as justification for the move. Manning Doherty, interim leader of the UFO caucus, could do nothing aside from win a ruling from the Speaker that, as leader of a caucus of more than 15 MLAs, he was entitled to an extra salary.

Eighteen months following the general election, William Raney was elected unanimously by his caucus as leader of what was now referred to as the &quot;Progressive&quot; bloc of MLAs which had begun as Farmer and Labour MLAs. Leslie Oke and Beniah Bowman refused to accept the leadership of Raney, a non-farmer, and also disagreed with the creation of a &quot;Progressive Party&quot; which would include non-farmers - with the support of &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Sun&quot;, they insisted on continuing to sit as UFO members rather than with the Progressive group. Bowman resigned from the legislature in 1926 in order to enter federal politics.

The issue which dominated Ontario politics in the mid-1920s was the Ferguson government&#x27;s proposal to repeal the &quot;Ontario Temperance Act&quot; and replace prohibition with government control of liquor. The Liberals were split on the issue - most of their MLAs were &quot;dry&quot; but some were &quot;wets&quot; who were opposed to prohibition. The Progressives under Raney, however, were adamantly in favour of prohibition and opposed to Ferguson&#x27;s proposals. This led to an estrangement with Labour MLA Karl Homuth who supported Ferguson&#x27;s proposals and would eventually join the Conservatives.

The 1926 provincial election reduced the farmer-labour contingent to thirteen Progressive MLAs and one Labour MLA (Homuth - who had broken with the Progressives and supported the government) while two new UFO MLAs, Thomas Farquhar and Farquhar Oliver, joined Oke&#x27;s faction. Several weeks after the election the UFO convention voted to cease running its own candidates, though a handful of local UFO clubs continued to nominate candidates for some years.

=== End of the movement (1927–1940) ===

Raney resigned from the legislature the next year in order to accept an appointment to the Supreme Court of Ontario and 72-year-old John Giles Lethbridge was chosen as the new leader of the Progressives. In the 1929 election, only five Progressives, one Labour and one UFO MLA won re-election. Lethbridge, like Raney in the previous election, campaigned largely on the issue of prohibition. After Lethbridge lost his seat in the 1929 election Harry Nixon, who had served as Provincial Secretary in Drury&#x27;s government, became the leader of the remaining Progressives. In the early 1930s, Nixon and the Progressives agreed to an alliance with former UFO activist Mitchell Hepburn who, in 1930, became leader of the Liberal Party. A group of four Liberal-Progressive MLAs, led by Nixon, were elected in the 1934 election, who joined Hepburn to form a government and were eventually absorbed into the Liberal Party. &quot;(see Liberal-Progressives (Ontario) for more information)&quot;

In 1932, leading UFO member Agnes Macphail (originally elected to the Progressive Party) encouraged the UFO to affiliate with Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) when it was formed. It did so, and MacPhail became the first Chairman of the Ontario CCF in 1932, but the UFO disaffiliated from the CCF in 1934 due to allegations of communist influence in the party. The UFO nominated candidates, incumbent MLA Farquhar Oliver and former MLA Leslie Oke, accordingly ran as UFO candidates in the 1934 provincial election rather than as CCFers. The UFO, like United Farmers groups in the provinces of western Canada, decided to withdraw entirely from electoral politics though Oliver and Macphail continued to run under the UFO banner until 1940. Many United Farmers joined the CCF as individuals. The UFO&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Sun&quot;, was sold to Graham Spry and Alan Plaunt and became an organ for the League for Social Reconstruction and the Ontario CCF.

In the 1935 federal election, the UFO&#x27;s provincial executive voted to endorse the new Reconstruction Party of Canada formed by H.H. Stevens; however, many local UFO groups backed the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and UFO MP Agnes MacPhail continued to work with the CCF on an informal basis. Other UFOers backed the Liberals. The Reconstruction Party won 11% of the vote in Ontario in the 1935 federal election, more than the CCF, but failed to win a seat in the province and only won one seat nationally.

In 1936, the UFO, the United Farmers’ Co-operative Ltd., and various growers and other agricultural organizations formed the Ontario Chamber of Agriculture which, in 1940, became the Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA), a non-partisan lobbying and marketing organization for farmers. In 1943, the UFO ceased to exist as a formal organization and its remnants were absorbed by the OFA. In 1948 the United Farmers&#x27; Co-operative became the United Co-operatives of Ontario and remains one of the largest farmer-owned co-operatives in Canada.

In 1940, Oliver, the last remaining UFO member of the Legislature and a supporter of the Hepburn government since 1934, joined the Hepburn cabinet and became a Liberal. MacPhail lost her seat as the last United Farmers MP in the House of Commons in the 1940 election. She turned to provincial politics and won election to the Ontario Legislature as a candidate of the CCF in the 1943 provincial election while Oliver became Liberal Party leader in 1945.

==United Farmers Co-operative Company Grocers==

Around 1919, the UFO hired Theodore Loblaw to help launch a chain of cooperative grocery stores, but the attempt failed and Loblaw left to start his own grocery chain.

<doc id="466612" wikidata="Q1284125" url="?curid=466612" title="Medium Cool">
<text>Medium Cool is a 1969 American drama film written and directed by Haskell Wexler and starring Robert Forster, Verna Bloom, Peter Bonerz, Marianna Hill and Harold Blankenship. It takes place in Chicago in the summer of 1968. It was notable for Wexler&#x27;s use of cinéma vérité–style documentary filmmaking techniques, as well as for combining fictional and non-fictional content.

The movie was met with widespread acclaim from numerous critics, including Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel of Siskel &amp; Ebert, both calling the movie a &quot;well-crafted masterpiece.&quot; The movie was also named one of the greatest movies of 1969, as well as one of the most influential movies in the New Hollywood movement. Robert Forster was also met with universal acclaim for his performance.

In 2003, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
John Cassellis is a television news cameraman. He and his sound recorder dispassionately film images of car accidents rather than help the victims.
Cassellis is seemingly hardened to ethical and social issues; he is more concerned with his personal life and pursuing audience-grabbing stories. Yet once Cassellis finds out that his news station has been providing the stories and information gathered by the cameramen and news journalists to the FBI, he becomes enraged. The news station creates an excuse to fire him, but he soon finds another job free-lancing at the Democratic National Convention.

In the course of his television job, Cassellis meets Eileen, a single mother, and her son, Harold, who have moved from West Virginia to Chicago. Harold tells a woman canvassing the neighborhood that his father, Buddy, is &quot;at Vietnam&quot;, but later tells Cassellis that he just took off one day and never came back. Eileen tells Cassellis that &quot;Buddy is dead.&quot; Cassellis grows fond of them both, mother and son.

When Harold goes missing, Eileen goes to the site of the convention to ask Cassellis for help. She finds herself in the midst of the riots. After witnessing acts of police brutality, Eileen finds Cassellis. As they drive to an undisclosed location, unaware that Harold has returned home, Cassellis accidentally crashes the car into a tree, killing Eileen and critically injuring himself. A passing driver stops to photograph the accident, after which he leaves the heavily damaged car behind.

* Marianna Hill as Ruth

==Production==
The title comes from Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s 1964 work &quot;Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man&quot;, in which he described TV as a &quot;cool&quot; medium (the &quot;cooler&quot; the medium, &quot;the more someone has to uncover and engage in the media&quot; in order to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot;). The film questions the role and responsibilities of television and its newscasts.

The music in the film was assembled by guitarist Mike Bloomfield (Haskell Wexler&#x27;s cousin). The film features contemporary music from the early Mothers of Invention albums by rock musician Frank Zappa, as well as the Love instrumental &quot;Emotions&quot; over the opening credits and as a recurring theme. Wexler has said the scene under the opening credits with the bike messenger delivering film to the television station was inspired by Jean Cocteau&#x27;s film &quot;Orpheus.&quot;

Harold Blankenship, who played the young boy Harold in &quot;Medium Cool&quot;, was tracked down by filmmaker Paul Cronin (who made the documentary &quot;Look out Haskell, it&#x27;s real&quot;) and appears in Cronin&#x27;s film &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;. Blankenship named his first son after Haskell Wexler.

Marianna Hill&#x27;s full nude scene wasn&#x27;t planned but the actress explained, &quot;Haskell was such a lovely man and I knew he couldn&#x27;t cause me any harm. I would never have done that for anybody else, but he was so interested in getting to the truth of a matter, and it was really his story.&quot;

==Historical context==
Shot at a time of great social and political counterculture upheaval in the United States, Wexler&#x27;s film reflects the nature of a country divided by issues of race, gender, poverty, crime and war. Such themes were touched upon by more mainstream films such as &quot;Getting Straight&quot; and &quot;The Strawberry Statement&quot; but Wexler&#x27;s treatment was considered controversial – the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system gave it an &#x27;X&#x27; rating. The censors &quot;objected to the language and the nudity&quot;, Wexler said later; &quot;What no one had the nerve to say was that it was a political &#x27;X&#x27;&quot;. In 1970 the film was re-rated &#x27;R&#x27;.

==Critical response==
Much of the critical response to &quot;Medium Cool&quot; concentrated on the revolutionary techniques of combining fact and fiction rather than the plot of the film. In his 1969 review, Roger Ebert wrote &quot;In &quot;Medium Cool&quot;, Wexler forges back and forth through several levels...There are fictional characters in real situations...there are real characters in fictional situations&quot;. While Ebert did not find the plot to be particularly innovative, he acknowledged that Wexler purposely left it up to his audience to fill in the gaps of the romance and at the same time presented images of great political significance. Ultimately, Ebert credited Wexler with masterfully combining multiple levels of film making to create a film that is &quot;important and absorbing&quot;. Ebert placed the film second on his list of the 10 best pictures of 1969.

In his 1969 review of the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby credits Wexler with presenting his audience with powerful imagery through the use of documentary film techniques. He wrote that &quot;Medium Cool&quot; was &quot;an angry, technically brilliant movie that uses some of the real events of last year the way other movies use real places — as backgrounds that are extensions of the fictional characters&quot;. Like Ebert, Canby pointed out that the political atmosphere of the film fills in the blanks left open by a relatively superficial plot. Canby noted the film&#x27;s historical significance, &quot;The result is a film of tremendous visual impact, a kind of cinematic &quot;Guernica&quot;, a picture of America in the process of exploding into fragmented bits of hostility, suspicion, fear and violence&quot;. Like Ebert, Canby felt that the real significance of the film was in its capturing of a political situation rather than its conventional success through plot and character development. Canby wrote that &quot;&quot;Medium Cool&quot; is an awkward and even pretentious movie, but... it has an importance that has nothing to do with literature&quot;.

==Film archives==
35mm safety prints are housed at the Harvard Film Archive, the Yale Film Archive and the Chicago Film Society.

==Home media==
&quot;Medium Cool&quot; was released to home video on May 21, 2013, by the Criterion Collection (under license from Paramount) as a Region 1 DVD and as a Region 1 Blu-Ray.

<text>Wreckx-n-Effect (originally Wrecks-n-Effect) is an American new jack swing group from Harlem, New York City. They are perhaps best known for their 1992 single &quot;Rump Shaker&quot;, which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==History==
In 1988 childhood friends Aqil Davidson, Markell Riley and Brandon &quot;B-Doggs&quot; Mitchell formed Wrecks-n-Effect. Their production co had an idea to try a fourth member on a trial basis. Keith &quot;K.C.&quot; Hanns joined the trio during the group&#x27;s development phase as their demo was being made. In 1988 on Atlantic Records the group debuted their concept EP with KC as their fourth member. Following very little fanfare on that debut four member EP, later that year, Davidson, Riley and Mitchell reconvened their initial vision as a trio. Soon after in 1989 the trio transitioned to Motown Records where they recorded their First LP, and achieved their First number one song on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart with the single &quot;New Jack Swing&quot;. Markell Riley is the brother of new jack swing producer Teddy Riley. and soon after transitioned to Motown Records. The group achieved their first number one song on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart with the single &quot;New Jack Swing&quot; in 1989 on Motown Records.

In 1990, former member DJ &quot;B-Doggs&quot; Brandon Mitchell was killed in a local shootout, which nearly caused Davidson and Riley to end the group. The group continued after encouragement from producer Teddy Riley and Michael Jackson. Aqil Davidson changed the spelling of Wrecks-n-Effect to Wreckx-n-Effect in honor of Mitchell.

In 1991, Teddy Riley built Future Recording Studios, a multi-million dollar recording studio in Virginia Beach, VA. Among the first records produced at Future Recording Studios, was Wreckx-n-Effect&#x27;s 1992 smash Rump Shaker, which would go on to reach number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Wreckx-n-Effect also recorded their 1992 album Hard or Smooth at Future Recording Studios, which would go on to sell roughly 2 million copies and peak at number 16 on the Billboard 200.

Conrad Tillard, then known variously as the Hip Hop Minister and Conrad Muhammad, became a fixture in hip-hop in 1993 after he arranged a meeting and a truce in a feud between rising bands Wreckx-n-Effect and A Tribe Called Quest, that Tillard said threatened to turn Harlem into a &quot;war zone&quot;.

<doc id="466618" wikidata="Q1073186" url="?curid=466618" title="Type 45 destroyer">
<text>The Type 45 destroyer, also known as the D or &quot;Daring&quot; class, is a class of six guided-missile destroyers built for the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy in the early 21st century. The class is primarily designed for anti-aircraft and anti-missile warfare and is built around the PAAMS (Sea Viper) air-defence system using the SAMPSON Active electronically scanned array (AESA) and the S1850M long-range radars. The first three destroyers were assembled by BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions from partially prefabricated &quot;blocks&quot; built at different shipyards; the remaining three were built by BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships. The first ship in the &quot;Daring&quot; class, HMS &quot;Daring&quot;, was launched on 1 February 2006 and commissioned on 23 July 2009.

The Type 45 destroyers were built to replace the Type 42 (&quot;Sheffield&quot;-class) destroyers that had served during the Falklands War, with the last Type 42 being decommissioned in 2013. The National Audit Office reported that, during an &quot;intensive attack&quot;, a single Type 45 could simultaneously track, engage and destroy more targets than five Type 42 destroyers operating together. After the launch of &quot;Daring&quot; on 1 February 2006, Admiral Sir Alan West, then First Sea Lord, stated that it would be the Royal Navy&#x27;s most capable destroyer ever, as well as the world&#x27;s best air-defence ship. The reduction in the number to be procured from twelve, then to (up to) eight, finally with only six confirmed (in 2008) was controversial.

In 2016, it was revealed that due to a design flaw on the Northrop Grumman intercooler attached to the Rolls-Royce WR-21 gas turbines, power availability was diminished considerably when functioning in the warm climate of the Persian Gulf, and it quickly became apparent that the class was not operating as originally envisioned. Therefore, a planned refit was scheduled from 2019 to 2021 to fully resolve the problems with the six ships in the class.

Under current plans, the Type 45 destroyer will be replaced by the Type 83 destroyer, the first of which is expected to enter service in the late 2030s.

==Development==
The UK had sought to procure a new class of air-defence guided-missile destroyers in collaboration with seven other NATO nations under the NFR-90 project; the project collapsed due to varying requirements of the different countries involved. The UK then joined France and Italy in the programme; however, differing national requirements, workshare arguments and delays led to the UK withdrawing on 26 April 1999 and starting its own national project. On 23 November 1999, Marconi Electronic Systems (MES), the defence arm of General Electric and in the process of merger with British Aerospace (BAe) since January, was confirmed as the prime contractor for the Type 45 project. Seven days later, MES and BAe completed the merger forming BAE Systems (BAE), making the latter the prime contractor.

The Type 45 project has been criticised for rising costs and delays, with the six ships costing £6.46 billion, an increase of £1.5 billion (29%) on the original budget. The first ship entered service in 2010, rather than 2007 as initially planned. In 2007, the Defence Select Committee expressed disappointment that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and BAE had failed to control rising costs.

===Construction===
The Type 45 destroyers take advantage of Horizon development work and use the Sea Viper air-defence system and the SAMPSON radar. The ships were built by BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships, which subsequently became BVT Surface Fleet with the merger of the surface shipbuilding arms of BAE Systems and VT Group. These two companies had previously built the ships in collaboration. BAE&#x27;s two Glasgow shipyards and single Portsmouth shipyard were responsible for different &quot;blocks&quot;. BAE&#x27;s Govan yard built Block A (stern to the edge of the helicopter hangar). The Scotstoun yard built Blocks B/C (a 2600-tonne section that contains the Rolls-Royce WR-21 gas turbines, starting with the helicopter hangar to the bridge section) and Block D (the bridge section itself). BAE&#x27;s Portsmouth shipyard was responsible for Blocks E/F (bridge to the bow), funnels, and masts. For ships two to six, blocks A–D were assembled in the Ships Block and Outfit Hall of the Govan shipyard and taken fully outfitted to the Scotstoun berth. The masts and funnels were also fitted before launch.

For the first-of-class, Block A was assembled at Govan and moved to Scotstoun, where it was mated to Block B/C, which was already fitted with the WR-21 turbines and machinery. Block D, also assembled at Scotstoun, was fitted to these three blocks. The bow sections (E/F) were mated at HMNB Portsmouth and taken by barge to Scotstoun. These were the final blocks to be attached. At this point, the hull was launched into the Clyde and towed to the Scotstoun Dry Dock, where the masts and funnels were fitted (the masts were partially outfitted with equipment. For example, the mast for the S1850M radar is sent from Portsmouth to Thales Nederland to be fitted with radar equipment). Once this was complete, the remaining equipment was fitted: radar arrays, bow-mounted sonar, propellers, missile equipment, and the 4.5-inch gun.

This modular construction arrangement was agreed upon in February 2002. However, when the original contract for three ships was signed in July 2000, BAE Systems Marine was to build the first and third ships, and VT Group was to build the second.

By the end of 2010, all six Type 45 destroyers had been launched, with the first two in commission and the remainder fitting out. By 2012, all destroyers were structurally complete and the production lines, had been closed. , the last of the Type 45 destroyers, was commissioned at Portsmouth Naval Base on 26 September 2013 and entered service in 2014 after trials and training.

The &quot;Daring&quot; class are the largest escorts ever built for the Royal Navy in terms of displacement.

In 2009, delivery of the ships&#x27; Aster missiles was delayed due to a manufacturing fault with a single batch of missiles identified during testing.

==Characteristics==

===General specifications===
The Type 45 destroyers are in length, with a beam of , a draught of and a displacement of approximately . This makes them significantly larger than the Type 42 they replaced (displacement ). The Type 45 destroyers are the first British warships built to meet the Lloyd&#x27;s Register&#x27;s Naval Ship Rules for hull structure requiring design approval by Lloyd&#x27;s Register for the principal structural arrangements of the vessel. BAE Systems is the Design Authority for the Type 45, a role traditionally held by the Ministry of Defence. The design of the Type 45 brings new levels of radar signature reduction to the Royal Navy. Deck equipment and life rafts are concealed behind the ship&#x27;s superstructure panels, producing a &quot;clean&quot; superstructure. The mast is also sparingly equipped externally. Speculation by the press suggests that this design gives the ship the radar cross-section of a small fishing boat.

The &quot;Daring&quot; class is notable for being the first Royal Navy vessels to include gender-neutral living spaces to accommodate male and female crew members; communal shower and heads facilities have given way to individual cubicles, and six-person berths for junior ratings are far more flexible in accommodating a mixture of male and female sailors. Men and women will continue to sleep in separate spaces, in common with most other navies.

===Propulsion and power===
The Type 45 is fitted with an advanced and innovative integrated electric propulsion system. Integrated electric propulsion seeks to supply all propulsion and the ship&#x27;s electrical load using alternating current at a high quality of voltage and frequency. This is achieved by computerised control, high-quality transformation, and electrical filtering. Two Rolls-Royce WR-21 gas turbines drive GE alternators, and along with two Wärtsilä 12V200 diesel generators, provide electrical power at 4,160 volts to a GE high voltage system. The high voltage supply is then used to power two GE Power Conversion advanced induction motors with outputs of each. Ship&#x27;s services, including hotel load and weapons system power supplies, are supplied via transformers from the high voltage supply at 440 V and 115 V. The benefits of integrated electric propulsion are cited as:

*Placing the electric motors closer to the propeller, shortening the shaft line and removing the need for a gearbox or controllable pitch propellers, and reducing exposure to action damage.
*Ability to arrange machinery in more convenient locations away from the shaft line, reducing space lost to funnels, and improving access for maintenance.
* Flexibility in running propulsion and ship services from any combination of prime movers, reducing engine running hours and emissions.
*Ability to distribute prime mover power between services and propulsion can accommodate future increases in service and weapon loads with minimal impact on ship speed or prime movers.

The key to the efficient use of a single prime mover is the choice of a gas turbine that provides efficiency over a large load range; the WR-21 gas turbine incorporates compressor intercooling and exhaust heat recovery, making it significantly more efficient than previous marine gas turbines, especially at low and medium load. The combination of greater efficiency and high fuel capacity gives an endurance of at . High power density and the hydrodynamic efficiency of a longer hull form allow high speeds to be sustained. It has been reported that &quot;Daring&quot; reached her design speed of in 70 seconds and achieved a speed of in 120 seconds during sea trials in August 2007.

====Faults====
In January 2016, the Ministry of Defence acknowledged that the propulsion system was (prior to upgrade) unreliable, with the BBC reporting that &quot;total electric failures are common&quot;.

The Rolls Royce WR-21 gas turbine itself is of a sound design, however, the Northrop Grumman intercooler unit &quot;has a major design flaw and causes the WR-21s to fail occasionally. When this happens, the electrical load on the diesel generators can become too great, and they &#x27;trip out&#x27;, leaving the ship with no source of power or propulsion. The First Sea Lord, Admiral Philip Jones, clarified that the &quot;WR-21 gas turbines were designed in extreme hot weather conditions to what we call &#x27;gracefully degrade&#x27; in their performance, until you get to the point where it goes beyond the temperature at which they would operate... we found that the resilience of the diesel generators and the WR-21 in the ship at the moment was not degrading gracefully; it was degrading catastrophically, so that is what we have had to address&quot;.

While the Ministry of Defence does not release detailed information related to the number of problems experienced by the class, including total engine failure, several such occasions have been reported in the media. &quot;Daring&quot; broke down in November 2010 and April 2012, &quot;Dauntless&quot; in February 2014 and &quot;Duncan&quot; in November 2016. In November 2017, &quot;The Register&quot; reported that a Type 45 destroyer had been recalled to Britain with propeller problems, leaving the Royal Navy&#x27;s traditional &quot;east of Suez&quot; deployment without proper warship cover. It was stated that &quot;HMS Diamond is on her way back to the UK after a propeller problem proved too much for the ship&#x27;s crew to repair on their own.&quot;

On 21 March 2018, the MoD announced the award of the £160 million &quot;Power Improvement Project&quot; (PIP) contract to BAE Systems, BMT Defence Services, and Cammell Laird to remove the two current diesel generators and install three larger diesel generators at the latter&#x27;s shipyard in Birkenhead. Replacement or rectification of the WR-21s was not a practical option. With the new diesel generators, the Type 45 needs to rely on the WR-21s only for higher-speed running and always with graceful degradation to cruising without catastrophic loss of power. &quot;Dauntless&quot; arrived at Cammell Laird on 6 May 2020 to become the first ship to start the PIP upgrade. Completion of the upgrade of all six ships is planned by the mid-2020s.

===Advanced air-defence===

The Type 45 destroyers are primarily designed for anti-air warfare, able to defend against targets such as fighter aircraft, drones, and highly manoeuverable sea-skimming anti-ship missiles travelling at supersonic speeds. The Royal Navy describes the destroyers&#x27; mission as &quot;to shield the Fleet from air attack&quot;.

The Type 45 destroyer is equipped with the Sea Viper (PAAMS) air-defence system utilising the SAMPSON active electronically scanned array multi-function radar and the S1850M long-range radar. PAAMS can track over 2,000 targets and simultaneously control and coordinate multiple missiles in the air at once, allowing a large number of tracks to be intercepted and destroyed at any given time. This makes it particularly difficult to swamp PAAMS during a saturation attack, even if the attacking elements are supersonic. The US Naval War College has suggested that the SAMPSON radar is capable of tracking 1,000 objects the size of a cricket ball travelling at three times the speed of sound (Mach 3), emphasising the system&#x27;s capabilities against high-performance stealth targets.

A core component of PAAMS is the Aster missile, comprising Aster 15 and Aster 30. MBDA describes Aster as a &quot;hit-to-kill&quot; anti-missile missile capable of intercepting all types of high-performance air threats at a maximum range of 120 km. The Aster missile is autonomously guided and equipped with an active RF seeker enabling it to cope with &quot;saturated attacks&quot; thanks to a &quot;multiple engagement capability&quot; and a &quot;high rate of fire&quot;. The &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyers are equipped with a 48-cell A50 Sylver Vertical Launching System, allowing for a mix of up to 48 Aster 15 and 30 missiles.

In addition to its anti-air warfare role, PAAMS offers additional anti-ballistic missile capabilities. In March 2013, the United States Naval Institute reported that the Royal Navy, along with the United States Missile Defense Agency, would explore the potential of the &quot;Daring&quot; class to provide ballistic missile defence in Europe along with United States Navy Aegis Combat System-equipped destroyers. In May 2014, Jane&#x27;s Information Group reported that the United Kingdom is committing more funds to explore the capabilities of the SAMPSON multi-function radar and the Type 45 destroyer in a ballistic missile defence role. This followed a successful live firing event at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, Kwajalein Atoll in the Western Pacific Ocean, where &quot;Daring&quot; demonstrated the ability to &quot;[detect] at the earliest opportunity, with tracks maintained through to intercept&quot; two medium-range ballistic missile surrogate targets. BAE Systems reportedly told Jane&#x27;s that the SAMPSON multi-function radar &quot;exceeded expectations in all respects&quot;. An &quot;Experiment Concurrency and Cueing (TECC)&quot; event for the Type 45 was planned for late 2015.

Due to the greater capabilities of the Type 45 over predecessors, the high price per ship, and the public attention they have attracted, defence analysts and correspondents have referred to them as the &quot;most advanced&quot; or &quot;most powerful&quot; air-defence destroyers in the world. BAE Systems claim that &quot;the Type 45 Destroyer is recognised as the most advanced anti-air warfare vessel in the world.&quot; Nick Brown, the editor-in-chief of Jane&#x27;s International Defence Review, was quoted by &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; saying, &quot;It&#x27;s certainly one of the most advanced air defence ships in the world... The US Aegis system is similar, but Sea Viper is more advanced.&quot;

==Weapons, countermeasures, capabilities and sensors==

===Anti-air warfare===
The Sea Viper air-defence system consists of the SAMPSON active electronically scanned array multi-function air tracking radar, which is capable of tracking hundreds of targets (range ).
* S1850M 3D long-range air surveillance radar, capable of tracking up to 1,000 targets (range 400 km).
A 48-cell A50 Sylver Vertical Launching System for a mix of up to 48 shorter-ranged Aster 15 missiles () and Aster 30 Block 0 missiles covering .

The Type 45 did not have a formal theatre ballistic missile defence (TBMD) capability, but its potential for such a role was being assessed. Land-based Aster 30 Block 1 missiles have intercepted short-range ballistic missiles, and trials of a land-based SAMPSON modified for BMD were planned for early 2012. The Ministry of Defence announced in 2013 that the first ship, &quot;Daring&quot;, would take part in ballistic defence trials with the US Missile Defence Agency (MDA) as part of a major research and development programme. In March 2016, Britain and France announced a joint procurement programme with the intention of France acquiring Brimstone missiles to equip the Eurocopter Tiger Mk 3 helicopter and Britain acquiring Aster Block 1NT missiles capable of intercepting medium-range ballistic missiles of range. A block 2 version of the Aster 30 NT capable of intercepting range missiles is under development by France and Italy.

Planned upgrades

In July 2021, it was announced that the destroyers&#x27; anti-air armament will be enhanced with the addition of a 24-cell silo for Sea Ceptor surface-to-air missiles. These were reported as likely to be in lieu of Aster 15 missiles, permitting the 48 Sylver A50 launch cells to be entirely devoted to carrying Aster 30. It was also announced that Eurosam will provide a refresh of the Aster 30 missile systems that are currently in use. All six ships are likely to be upgraded from 2026 to 2032.

In May 2022, the Ministry of Defence announced that the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 45 destroyers would be upgraded with a ballistic missile defence capability. As part of this upgrade, which is named the Sea Viper Evolution programme, the six ships will be equipped with Aster 30 Block 1 missiles and will receive upgrades to their SAMPSON radars and Sea Viper command and control systems.

===Guns===
* 1 × BAE Systems 4.5-inch Mark 8 Mod 1 naval gun. , the Mk 8 Mod 1 is scheduled to remain in service until the 2030s, with a Mod 2 upgrade along the way to address obsolescence. 
* 2 × 30 mm Small Calibre Guns on single DS-30B mounts.
* 2 × Phalanx 20 mm calibre close-in weapon systems (CIWS).
* 2 × 7.62 mm M134 Miniguns. (replaced by 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) Browning heavy machine guns as of 2023)
* Up to 6 × 7.62 mm L7A2 General Purpose Machine Guns.

===Aviation===
The flight deck of the Type 45 is large enough to accommodate aircraft up to the size of a Boeing Chinook helicopter. It has hangar space for either one Merlin HM1 or two Westland Lynx helicopters. The Merlin HM2 has a dipping sonar, sonobuoys and radar; the Merlin can carry four anti-submarine Sting Ray torpedoes, while the smaller Lynx HMA8 can carry either two Sting Ray torpedoes or four Sea Skua anti-ship missiles. 
From 2015, the Lynx has been replaced in RN service by the AW159 Wildcat, whose weapons will include the Martlet missile from 2021 and the &#x27;Future Air-to-Surface Guided Weapon (Heavy)&#x27; missile from 2026. The Wildcat relies on the ship&#x27;s sensors in attacking submarine targets since, in RN service as of 2019, it lacks dipping sonar or sonobuoys of its own.

===Anti-ship, submarine and land-attack===
Four of the six Type 45 destroyers received Harpoon launchers recycled from the last four decommissioned Type 22 frigates. &quot;Duncan, Diamond&quot; and &quot;Daring&quot; have all received this upgrade. However, Harpoon SSMs are to be withdrawn from the Type 45s by 2023. As of 2022, it was reported that Harpoon SSMs were no longer deployed on the destroyer. In November 2022, it was announced that the Royal Navy will receive the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) to replace Harpoon, which will be fitted to Type 45 destroyers. In March 2023, HMS &quot;Duncan&quot; was reportedly re-equipped with Harpoon.

The Type 45 has a bow-mounted medium-frequency Ultra/EDO MFS-7000 sonar but has no shipboard anti-submarine weapons. The class relies on its helicopter(s) for ASW. , there were no plans to fit anti-submarine torpedo tubes.

The 4.5-inch Mark 8 Mod 1 naval gun can be used against ships and for naval gunfire support (NGS) against land targets.

===Countermeasures===
* The Seagnat decoy system allows for the seduction and distraction of radar-guided weapons through active and passive means. An infrared countermeasure device is planned for future retrofits.
* Airborne Systems&#x27;s Naval Decoy IDS300 floating naval decoy system (corner reflectors).
* Surface Ship Torpedo Defence System (SSTD) active torpedo decoy system.

===Communications and other systems===
* Fully Integrated Communications System (FICS45): a combined external and internal communications system supplied by Thales and Selex ES Ltd.
* In 2012, the UAT Mod 2.0 digital Radar Electronic Surveillance system was fitted to &quot;Daring&quot; and &quot;Diamond&quot; as part of a £40m contract with Thales UK that will see UAT Mod 2.1 fitted to the other Type 45s.
* METOC Meteorology and Oceanography: The Metoc system by BAE Systems comprises the Upper Air Sounding System using launchable radiosondes by Eurodefence Systems Ltd and Graw Radiosondes (Germany) joint venture, as well as a comprehensive weather satellite receiving system and a bathymetric system. These sensors provide each vessel with full environmental awareness for tasks such as radar propagation, ballistics, and general self-supporting meteorological and oceanographic data production.

===Additional capabilities===
The Type 45 has sufficient space to embark 60 Royal Marines and their equipment.

The Type 45 destroyers are designed with the ability to operate as flagships.

== Operational history ==

In support of protecting merchant ships transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, HMS &quot;Diamond&quot; shot down a suspected attack drone targeting commercial shipping with a single Sea Viper (Aster) missile on the night of 15 December 2023. According to &quot;Navy Lookout&quot;, the Sea Viper missile that was used costs around £1–2 million and the drone it shot down may have only cost 20,000 US dollars. In the same theatre of war, the United States Navy ship, USS Carney, has shot down 14 drones, most likely, using her main gun which is a much cheaper method. The Royal Navy is unable to use the main gun on their ships to do this, the 4.5-inch Mark 8, because software support for anti-aircraft use has been withdrawn (RN ships will not have anti-aircraft gun capability until the Type 26 frigates, or Type 31 frigates, are in service). The in service Type 23 frigates have the Sea Ceptor missile system which can be used to shoot down drones and is cheaper than the Sea Viper (Aster) missile system. It will be several years until the Type 45 destroyers are fitted with the Sea Ceptor upgrade. On 10 January 2024, it was reported that &quot;Diamond&quot; had shot down seven drones in the Red Sea using a combination of her missiles and guns on 9 January as part of a force that brought down &quot;21 drones and missiles&quot; that night. 

On Wednesday 24 April 2024, HMS &quot;Diamond&quot; used a single Sea Viper (Aster) missile to shoot down a ballistic missile which had been launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and which according to American sources was likely targeting a US container ship. It was the first time since the Gulf War of 1991 that the Royal Navy had intercepted any kind of missile in combat, when HMS &quot;Gloucester&quot; shot down an Iraqi Silkworm cruise missile. It is also the first time that the Royal Navy&#x27;s Sea Viper system has shot down a ballistic missile in combat.

==Ships in the class==
Six ships were ordered, and transfer of custody of the first happened on 10 December 2008. The MoD&#x27;s initial planning assumption was to procure twelve ships on a like-for-like replacement of a similar number of Type 42s, with the size of the second batch to be determined between 2005 and 2010. However, this was reduced to eight ships in the 2003 defence white paper entitled &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities&quot;, following a strategic refocusing on &quot;small to medium-scale operations&quot; and expeditionary land operations. It was reported in December 2006 that the last two could be cut. In July 2007, Ministry of Defence officials stated that they &quot;still planned to build eight Type 45 destroyers&quot; and that &quot;the extra two ships were still included in planning assumptions&quot;. This plan was officially abandoned on 19 June 2008 when the Minister for the Armed Forces, Bob Ainsworth, announced in Parliament that options for the seventh and eighth destroyers would not be taken up. The continual scaling back of the project, first from twelve to eight, and subsequently to six ships, has been criticised for leaving the Royal Navy with insufficient ships to meet its requirements.

On 9 March 2007, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that Saudi Arabia was considering buying &quot;two or three&quot; Type 45s. On 7 September 2007, it was reported that Saudi Arabian officials had been invited to observe &quot;Daring&quot;″s sea trials.

In 2009, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee conducted an enquiry into the procurement. Its main conclusions were that despite the destroyer being based on 80% new technology, there was a failure to take sufficient account of technical risk, over-optimism, and an inappropriate too-early fixed price project entered into before many elements had been specified. This resulted in a difficult commercial relationship until a contract renegotiation in 2007. It noted that the MoD believed six ships would still enable it to meet the operational requirement of having five ships at sea, with only a small risk of failing to meet that requirement.

In July 2016, it was reported that all six of the class were docked in Portsmouth. The Ministry of Defence said it was &quot;unusual but not unprecedented&quot; and that &quot;All Type 45 destroyers are currently in port as they have either just returned from operations or are about to be deployed, are conducting training or carrying out maintenance or are home for crew to take summer leave.&quot;

In an interview with the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, former Rear Admiral Chris Parry claimed that the Type 45 destroyers are noisy ships that can be heard away by submarines. Parry claimed that noise suppression in surface ships has been ignored since the end of the Cold War; the MoD responded to this claim by stating that as air defence ships, noise suppression was not a &quot;premium requirement&quot; for the Type 45 class.

In response to a written question in the House of Commons on 19 July 2021, Jeremy Quinn Minister of State, Ministry of Defence, detailed the status of the Type 45 destroyers as 4 undergoing refit in the UK, one being repaired abroad having been forced to detach from the CSG21 formation and one active with CSG21.

In January 2024 John Healey, Shadow Secretary of State for Defence, submitted a written question:
“To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what the current status is of each of the Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyers”.
James Cartlidge, Minister of State for the Ministry of Defence, responded:
“HMS Diamond, HMS Duncan and HMS Dauntless are all currently available for operations. HMS Daring, HMS Dragon and HMS Defender are all currently at various stages of the Power Improvement Project (PIP).”

The entire class is based at HMNB Portsmouth. All ships were built by BAE Systems Surface Ships.

Three ships of the Type 45 &quot;Daring&quot; class carry the same names as members of the previous s of 1949; these are: , and . These names had been used for the D-class destroyers of the 1930s. The name , has been used for several ships, including the D-class flotilla leader, and also one of the Type 14 (&quot;Blackwood&quot;-class) frigates in the 1950s. The remaining Type 45 names, and , were most recently carried by D-class (or &quot;Danae&quot;-) light cruisers of 1918, which served until 1945.

In December 2020, the Minister for Defence Procurement, Jeremy Quin, indicated that under plans at that time, the Type 45 destroyers would be decommissioned between 2035 and 2038. In January 2024, James Cartlidge, the Minister of State for Defence Procurement, responded to a written question, saying that the last destroyer will retire from service by the end of 2038.

<doc id="466621" wikidata="Q4970045" url="?curid=466621" title="British Helsinki Human Rights Group">
<text>The British Helsinki Human Rights Group (BHHRG) was an Oxford-based non-governmental organization which claimed to monitor human rights in the 56 participating States of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Despite its name, the organisation was not affiliated to the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights. BHHRG was critical of what it characterized as Western interference in imposing democracy, and claimed to support the right of political independence from the west of a number of Communist and post-Communist regimes, as well as of a number of African dictators.

The group also used the name OSCEwatch, indicating that it saw part of its mission as scrutinising the activities of the OSCE. The OSCEwatch and BHHRG websites are identical, and both websites openly refer to each other.

The British Charity Commission removed the group&#x27;s listing in September 2010, noting &quot;Ceased to exist&quot;.

==Membership and funding==
The BHHRG was founded in 1992. It was run from the Oxford home of historian Professor Norman Stone, who on occasion took part in BHHRG activities, and was co-founded by his wife Christine Stone and fellow Oxford historian Mark Almond (who was also its chairman). Its trustees comprised Mark Almond, Anthony Daniels (who writes for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; under the pseudonym Theodore Dalrymple), John Laughland, Christine Stone and Mary Walsh. Almond, Daniels, Laughland and Stone were members of Britain&#x27;s conservative intelligentsia and regular contributors to British newspapers. Chad Nagle, an American lawyer who frequently contributes to the website antiwar.com, was also associated with the group. Noel Malcolm, a historian of early modern Britain and Europe who in the 1990s and early 2000s wrote books on aspects of Balkan history, appeared on a 1994 list of founders and spoke on its behalf in 1999 but later apparently left the group.

The BHHRG was not an &quot;official&quot; Helsinki Committee, as it was not affiliated with the Helsinki Committees&#x27; umbrella organisation, the then International Helsinki Federation (IHF). The United Kingdom&#x27;s representative in the IHF was the British Helsinki Subcommittee of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group, established in 1976. This led to the BHHRG being mistakenly labelled the British Helsinki Committee, which prompted the British Helsinki Subcommittee to ask visitors to its website to

:&quot;PLEASE NOTE that the so-called British Helsinki Group is NOT affiliated with the IHF&quot; .

For its part, the BHHRG website said nothing on the subject.

The membership, management and funding of the BHHRG were somewhat obscure. These aspects did not appear to be discussed at all on its website, and the details of its trustees were given only in its legally required returns to the UK&#x27;s Charity Commission. Its published accounts stated that it received £417,332 in income between 1997–2003 and spent £449,086 in the same period. The organisation later appeared to fall on hard times, with its funding falling by nearly 99% after 2001. A possible reason was suggested by &quot;The Economist&quot;, which reported in 2004 that

:&quot;the group lost almost all its supporters when it threw its weight behind people like Mr Milošević.&quot;

The identity of its backers was also unclear. Still with them in 1999, Noel Malcolm explained that the group does not disclose its donors

:&quot;for obvious reason[s]: they [critics] would then start to campaign [against the group] with the financial backers.&quot;

Only a few contributors were known by name. Material that the BHHRG issued in 1992 cited the UKIP (then-Tory) peer Lord Pearson of Rannoch and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation as donors. The BHHRG&#x27;s &quot;About Us&quot; page stated that it &quot;does not receive funding from any government&quot; but, according to a Foreign Office source, it received money from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for an election observer mission in 1995. 
The source said funding was cut off because they found the group prejudiced, partial and unreliable.

It subsequently received no funding from this source and its advocates said this proved the group was independent of governments.

==Activities==

The BHHRG website claimed that the main activities of the Group included:

* Monitoring the conduct of elections in OSCE member states.
* Examining issues relating to press freedom and freedom of speech
* Reporting on conditions in prisons and psychiatric institutions
* Covering asylum and immigration issues

The BHHRG published reports from first-hand observers, concentrating on election monitoring in central and eastern Europe, as well as publishing frequent unsigned commentaries (just like the Economist does) about events in the region. A common theme in many of its publications was a critical view of Western &quot;meddling in the internal affairs&quot; of central and east European countries, notably the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Belarus.

Among its achievements the BHHRG&#x27;s website claimed:

* 1992 – BHHRG was the first NGO to expose the human rights situation in the former Soviet republic of Georgia
* 1993 – BHHRG exposure of fraud in the conduct of Russia&#x27;s constitutional referendum was later admitted by the authorities.
* 1996 – BHHRG report of election fraud in Armenia&#x27;s presidential election was only acknowledged in 1998
* 1998 – BHHRG predicted war in Kosovo in late February (after US envoy Robert Gelbard called the Kosovo Albanian separatist KLA a &#x27;terrorist group&#x27;)
* 1999 – BHHRG was the first human rights group to visit the notorious Sangatte camp for asylum seekers in France
* 2001 – BHHRG exposed the scandal of trafficking in women from Moldova

==Most controversial aspects==

The media connections of some of BHHRG members enabled it to propagate its views through a number of major newspapers in Britain and the US. Yet it became famous only when it publicly denounced what were widely perceived as democratic movements against authoritarian former Communist rulers.

Among actions critics of the BHHRG find ill-advised:

* The BHHRG based part of a Latvia report on an interview with Alfreds Rubiks, the Communist who led the &quot;National Salvation Committee&quot; which would have co-ordinated repression had the coup against Gorbachev not failed in 1991.
* In March 1997, BHHRG member Anthony Daniels wrote an article for the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;: &quot;The Media Back the Communists as Usual&quot;, in which he claimed that British journalists Miranda Vickers and James Pettifer, were &quot;supporters of the former Stalinist regime of the late Enver Hoxha&quot;, the former communist dictator of Albania. They sued the paper for libel and settled out of court, with the &quot;Telegraph&quot; paying £10,000 to each and printing an apology.
* Another leading member, Christine Stone, has also written approvingly of Zimbabwe&#x27;s Robert Mugabe.

Other statements by the BHHRG included:

* denouncing as a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; staged by his former protégés the November 2003 &quot;Rose Revolution&quot; in Georgia which deposed president Eduard Shevardnadze (this is cited by them as an example of how the Western powers use and then dispose of their agents in the so-called Euro-Atlantic space).
* claiming that the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia should not be prosecuting Slobodan Milošević for his alleged crimes because they find fault with its procedures and
* that NATO should be prosecuted instead for bombing Yugoslavia on behalf of Kosovo Albanian separatists.
* claiming that elections in Belarus &quot;met democratic standards&quot;, in opposition to the OSCE&#x27;s contrary claim, and claiming that the OCSE did not actually observe the elections.
* that Latvia was not occupied by the Soviet Union but was &quot;incorporated&quot; into the USSR,
* that the Romani people of the Czech Republic do not suffer racism as generally reported,
* that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian authorities acted correctly in the Beslan hostage crisis.
* that concern for the massacres in the Sudan was driven by a lust for oil, and
* that the second round of the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election was &quot;generally representative of genuine popular will&quot; and not falsified by the authorities, so that the December rerun election was illegitimate.
John Laughland (who said that reports of mass graves in Iraq were exaggerated for political purposes) characterised some supporters of Ukraine&#x27;s Viktor Yushchenko as &quot;neo-Nazis&quot; and many of those backing him on the streets as &quot;druggy skinheads from Lvov&quot; whereas principal elements of the Jewish community supported Yushchenko.

These last claims prompted the publication of well-documented articles &quot;exposing&quot; the BHHRG&#x27;s exploits. 
The British weekly &quot;The Economist&quot; published &quot;Yanukovich&#x27;s friends: A human-rights group that defends dictators&quot;. 
The daily &quot;Guardian&quot; published &quot;PR man to Europe&#x27;s nastiest regimes&quot;, written by David Aaronovitch, to which John Laughland, the subject of the article, objected, saying that it was &quot;almost identical to&quot; an article on a web site carrying &quot;virulently antisemitic articles about the Jewish proclivity for rape, and about how the gas chambers at Auschwitz could not have existed&quot;. The controversy attracted many comments on the internet. The BHHRG&#x27;s advocates reply by quoting Aleksandr Tsinker, &quot;Head of the Observer Mission from the &quot;Institute for East European and CIS Nations&quot;&quot; — an organization publicly known for nothing else — as saying that the Ukrainian election &quot;was a free expression of the voters&#x27; will&quot;.

Some of the BHHRG&#x27;s statements were favorably quoted by the isolationist right in the US, by opponents of US foreign policy, as well as governments regarded by Western authorities as authoritarian and criminal, such as that of Belarus.

Its critics accused the BHHRG of taking a predetermined ideological line while observing elections. A British Foreign Office official quoted by Jeremy Druker said of them:

:&quot;It was very clear that they had their own agenda. They also monitored the elections in Georgia in 1995, and it would appear Almond and his people had made up their minds about the election report even before the election had taken place. People at the time were not happy with the way that they monitored the election… they didn&#x27;t set out in an impartial spirit.&quot;

The BHHRG was almost always more critical of social-democratic than nationalist rulers.
&quot;The Economist&quot; characterises the BHHRG&#x27;s opinion as &quot;an intense dislike of liberal internationalism.&quot; Tom Palmer of the libertarian Cato Institute summarizes their position as being that

:the mass movements to unseat [governments in eastern Europe] are nothing but stooges for the west, out to integrate those brave little authoritarian-socialist regimes into the &#x27;New World Order,&#x27; privatize their state industries, and strip them of their assets.

The BHHRG&#x27;s commentaries indeed alleged that Western governments and international organisations were seeking to implement a &quot;New World Order&quot; in central and eastern Europe. Its supporters claimed that the organisation exposes matters which Western governments and biased international organisations such as the UN and the OSCE had rather remained unknown.

For instance, it claimed it denounced human rights abuses committed in Georgia while these were ignored by the OSCE and the Council of Europe. Mark Almond, who has written on Balkan matters, criticised the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia on behalf of Albanian separatists in Kosovo as a &quot;violation of international law&quot; which resulted in &quot;cultural genocide&quot; against Serbs.
As self-proclaimed monitors of Human Rights in the countries concerned, they accused other intergovernmental organisations of being undemocratic, unelected, unaccountable, non-transparent meddlers in their internal affairs.

The OSCE criticized the BHHRG for letting its journalists pose as impartial election monitors while publishing partisan polemics in newspapers, and for relying on short-term observer missions with a handful of people, an approach the OSCE abandoned as open to manipulation in 1996. 
(The OSCE now uses large-scale long-term missions of four to six weeks with dozens of experts and hundreds of observers.)
The BHHRG dismissed the OSCE&#x27;s position as an attempt to stifle legitimate criticism and independent reporting.

==Name issues==

The BHHRG was also denounced for failing to mention that it enjoyed no recognition from the International Helsinki Federation, but was at odds with other organizations with similar names, at least since 1996.
The International Helsinki Federation (IHF) felt the need to issue a public statement disclaiming any connection with the group. The Greek National Committee of the said Federation, which has been effective throughout the Balkans, also published a press release to denounce what it felt was the BHHRG&#x27;s impostures, while others accused it of &quot;nam[ing] itself so as to usurp the prestige of its elder&quot;.
Monika Horaková, a Roma member of the Czech parliament, said in an open letter condemning a BHHRG&#x27;s report in 1999:

:&quot;I had thought that the Helsinki Group was a non-partisan body interested in exposing and helping to solve human rights abuses in the world. This report caused me to question my previously held beliefs. However, I have since learned that the BHHRG has no connection to the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights in Vienna. It is a disgrace that the BHHRG is using the good Helsinki name to mislead the public into thinking that their racist propaganda is somehow affiliated with the well-respected Helsinki Group.&quot;

Supporters of the BHHRG replied that the name &quot;Helsinki&quot; is not trademarked anywhere and no official imprimatur is needed for any group wishing to monitor the implementation of the Helsinki Accords. They noted that the European Commission established a &quot;Helsinki Group on Women and Science&quot; in Helsinki in 1999, with no connection with the monitoring of Helsinki Accords.

<doc id="466622" wikidata="Q430607" url="?curid=466622" title="Ryszard Kukliński">
<text>Ryszard Jerzy Kukliński (June 13, 1930February 11, 2004) was a Polish Army colonel and Cold War spy for NATO. He was posthumously promoted to brigadier general by Polish President Andrzej Duda. 

Between 1972 and 1981 Kukliński passed top-secret Soviet documents to the CIA, including Soviet plans for the invasion of Western Europe. 

Former United States National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzeziński described him as &quot;the first Polish officer in NATO.&quot;

==Biography==

Kukliński was born in Warsaw to a working-class family with strong Catholic and socialist traditions. During World War II, his father became a member of the Polish resistance movement; he was captured by the Gestapo, and subsequently died in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. After the war, Kukliński began a successful career in the Polish People&#x27;s Army. In 1964, he began work in Polish espionage and counterintelligence operations. In 1968, he took part in preparations for the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s invasion of Czechoslovakia. Disturbed by the invasion, and by the brutal crushing of the parallel Polish 1970 protests, in 1972, Kukliński sent a letter to the US embassy in Bonn describing himself as an army officer from a Communist country and requesting a secret meeting.

In 1994, Kukliński said that his awareness of the &quot;unambiguously offensive&quot; nature of Soviet military plans was an important factor in his decision to communicate the details of those plans to the United States, adding that &quot;Our front could only be a sacrifice of Polish blood at the altar of the Red Empire&quot;. Kukliński was also concerned that his homeland would be turned into a nuclear wasteland as the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s superiority in conventional forces would mean NATO would respond to military action with tactical nuclear weapons.

Between 1972 and 1981, he passed 35,000 pages of mostly Soviet secret documents to the CIA. The documents described Moscow&#x27;s strategic plans regarding the use of nuclear weapons, technical data about the T-72 tank and 9K31 Strela-1 missiles, the whereabouts of Soviet anti-aircraft bases in Poland and East Germany, the methods used by the Soviets to avoid spy satellite detection of their military hardware, plans for the imposition of martial law in Poland, and many other matters.
He was the first foreign recipient of the Distinguished Intelligence Medal.

===Escape to the United States===
Facing imminent danger of discovery from a denunciation by a secret Communist collaborator known only by his alias &quot;Prorok&quot;, Kukliński, his wife and two sons were spirited out of Poland by the CIA shortly before the imposition of martial law in December 1981. Though Kukliński and his family successfully defected, his past may have followed him to the United States as both of his sons later died in separate incidents. The older, Waldemar, was run over by a truck without a licence plate in August 1994 on the grounds of an American university. His younger son, Bogdan Kukliński, drowned on December 31, 1993, when his yacht capsized on a quiet sea. Ryszard Kukliński did not claim that they were assassinated, but never rejected such a possibility either.

On May 23, 1984, Kukliński was sentenced to death, in absentia, by a military court in Warsaw. After the fall of communism, the sentence was changed to 25 years. In 1995, the court revoked the sentence and said that Kukliński was acting under special circumstances and Kukliński visited Poland again in April 1998.

===Death===
He died from a stroke at the age of 73 in Tampa, Florida, February 11, 2004. The funeral mass for Kukliński was held at Fort Myer with CIA honors on March 30, 2004. His remains were transported to Poland and on June 19, 2004, Kukliński was buried in the row of honour in the Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw, Poland, along with the remains of his son Waldemar.

==Legacy==
In June 1986, a spokesman for the Soviet-backed Jaruzelski regime, Jerzy Urban, revealed Kukliński&#x27;s existence to the world in order to make the argument that the Reagan administration had been informed by Kukliński of the plans to install martial law but had betrayed the Solidarity movement by not passing that information on to its &quot;friends&quot; in Solidarity. When the journal Kultura interviewed Kukliński, he said that planning for martial law had begun in late 1980 and that the Jaruzelski group planned to crush Solidarity regardless of the outcome of negotiations with the trade union and the Polish church. He also rejected the regime&#x27;s claim that declaring martial law was an internal decision by describing how the Soviets had applied pressure on Polish authorities to impose martial law. When asked whether Jaruzelski was a hero or a traitor, Kukliński replied:

My view has been consistently that in Poland there existed a real chance to avoid both Soviet intervention and martial law. Had he, together with Stanislaw Kania, proved capable of greater dignity and strength, had they honestly adhered to the existing social agreements, instead of knuckling under to Moscow, present-day Poland would undoubtedly look completely different.

Kukliński was the chief of a military strategic command planning division of the Polish army. He was very familiar with the layout of the Polish forces within the Warsaw Pact. While details of the general plans for the Warsaw Pact forces were known only in Moscow, Kukliński could infer much from his contacts at the Moscow high command headquarters.

According to President Carter&#x27;s NSA, Zbigniew Brzeziński, &quot;Kukliński&#x27;s information permitted us to make counterplans to disrupt command-and-control facilities rather than only relying on a massive counterattack on forward positions, which would have hit Poland.&quot;

In January 2013, Władysław Pasikowski began shooting a movie about Ryszard Kukliński. With Marcin Dorociński in the lead role, the script for &quot;Jack Strong&quot; (title taken from Kukliński&#x27;s CIA secret-agent pseudonym), written by director Pasikowski, is based on new material from the Polish Institute of National Remembrance archives, CIA operating documents and statements by eyewitnesses including David Forden, the former CIA operations officer who was the liaison with Colonel Kukliński.

==Opinions in Poland==
During his term as Poland&#x27;s first freely elected president, a Solidarity leader, Lech Wałęsa, refused to pardon Kukliński and a poll taken in 1998 found that more Poles (34%) considered Kukliński a traitor than a hero (29%), with many undecided. The administration of US President Clinton nonetheless took the stance that it would oppose Polish membership in NATO unless Kukliński were exonerated.

When all charges were dropped against Kukliński in 1997, the left-leaning Trybuna lamented that &quot;Colonel Ryszard Kukliński—a spy, deserter, and traitor—has been turned into a model of virtue and a national hero of the rightists.&quot; In a 1997 survey conducted by the CBOS, 27 percent of Poles considered Kukliński a hero and 24 percent a traitor (compared to 12 and 24 percent, respectively, in 1992).

According to some historians, it was possible that Kukliński was a double agent, of the Soviet GRU, used in an operational game with the CIA. A Polish Minister of Internal Affairs during communist times, Czesław Kiszczak, revealed such a theory in a later interview, while a former Soviet military attaché, Yuriy Rylyov, claimed so directly in an interview. Historians like and (a general in the Polish Army during communist times) suggest that the knowledge Kukliński had was exaggerated, and while he had a lot of information about the Polish Army and the organization of the Warsaw Pact in general, he could not have had detailed information on Soviet plans, since no one in Poland had it. Puchała supported his opinion in official hearings of Kukliński by Polish prosecutors during his revised trial. Revealing plans about the enforcement of martial law in Poland, which would make a Soviet invasion unnecessary, could have been profitable for the Soviet side, ensuring that the US would not be surprised by martial law and would not undertake unpredictable actions against the Soviets. It is noteworthy, that despite Kukliński&#x27;s revelations, the US did not warn Solidarity about martial law. The Soviets took the escape of such an important spy nonchalantly and did not demand any consequences from the Polish politician responsible for intelligence, namely Czesław Kiszczak. Also, the matter of Kukliński&#x27;s sons&#x27; deaths is unclear and they may have been part of a protection program; besides, according to Wieczorkiewicz, such revenge on a defector&#x27;s family would be quite unusual for Soviet intelligence.

Kukliński is buried in the row of honour in the Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw, and he has been given honorary citizenship of several Polish cities, including Kraków and Gdańsk. The Polish political group &quot;Centrum&quot; (at the time headed by Zbigniew Religa) requested in 2004 that the President of Poland posthumously promote Kukliński to the rank of general.

Since its unveiling in 2006, his monument in Kraków had been vandalized three times. The first instance was on December 13, 2011 (the anniversary of martial law in Poland), and the second on February 11, 2012 (the anniversary of Kukliński&#x27;s death); in both cases, terms such as &quot;traitor&quot;, the CIA&#x27;s name (crossed out) and &quot;Death to the USA&quot; were sprayed. On February 11, 2014, his statue was found splashed with brown paint or oil.

<doc id="466624" wikidata="Q613486" url="?curid=466624" title="Gorillas (video game)">
<text>Gorillas, also known under the source code&#x27;s file name &quot;GORILLA.BAS&quot;, is a video game first distributed with MS-DOS 5 and published in 1990 by Microsoft. It is a turn-based artillery game. With allusions to King Kong, the game consists of two gorillas throwing explosive bananas at each other above a city skyline. The players can adjust the angle and velocity of each throw. 

Written in QBasic, it is one of the programs included as a demonstration of that programming language. The others are &quot;Nibbles&quot; (another game), &quot;Money&quot; (a simple financial calculator), and &quot;REMLINE&quot; (a program to remove line numbers from old BASIC programs).

==QB64 version==
QB64 included a copy of &quot;Gorillas&quot;, adapted to be run at proper speed, until it was removed due to copyright concerns. As the compiler does not support DEF FN for inline functions, the original code was also adapted to use regular functions.

<doc id="466636" wikidata="Q3538234" url="?curid=466636" title="Travis McGee">
<text>Travis McGee is a fictional character, created by American mystery writer John D. MacDonald. McGee is neither a police officer nor a private investigator; instead, he is a self-described &quot;salvage consultant&quot; who recovers others&#x27; property for a fee of 50 percent. McGee appeared in 21 novels, from &quot;The Deep Blue Good-by&quot;, first published in 1964, to &quot;The Lonely Silver Rain&quot; in 1985. In 1980, the McGee novel &quot;The Green Ripper&quot; won a National Book Award in a one-year Mystery category. All 21 books have the theme of a color in the title, one of the earliest examples of detective/mystery fiction series to have a &#x27;title theme&#x27; (e.g., the Sue Grafton &#x27;alphabet&#x27; series; Janet Evanovich&#x27;s &#x27;number&#x27; series of Stephanie Plum books, etc.).

== Profile ==
Travis McGee lives on a 52-foot houseboat dubbed &quot;The Busted Flush.&quot; The boat is named after the circumstances in which he won the boat in what McGee describes as a &quot;poker siege&quot; of 30 hours of intensive effort in Palm Beach—the run of luck started with a bluff of four hearts (2-3-7-10) and a club (2), which created a &quot;busted flush,&quot; as described in Chapter 3 of &quot;The Deep Blue Good-by&quot;. The books are all narrated by McGee, writing in the first-person past-tense. The boat is generally docked at slip F-18 at Bahia Mar Marina, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. A self-described &quot;beach bum&quot; who &quot;takes his retirement in installments,&quot; McGee prefers to take on new cases only when the spare cash (besides a reserve fund) in a hidden safe in the &quot;Flush&quot; runs low. McGee also owns a custom 1936 vintage Rolls-Royce that had been converted into a pickup truck by some previous owner long before he bought it, and another previous owner painted it &quot;that horrid blue.&quot; McGee named it &quot;Miss Agnes&quot;, after one of his elementary school teachers whose hair was the same shade.

McGee&#x27;s business card reads &quot;Salvage Consultant,&quot; and most business comes to him by word of mouth. His clients are usually people who have been deprived of something important and/or valuable, typically by unscrupulous or illegal means, and have no way to regain it lawfully. McGee&#x27;s usual fee is half the value of the item (if recovered) with McGee risking expenses, and potential clients who object to such a seemingly high fee are reminded that getting back half of something is better than owning all of nothing. Although the missing items are usually tangible (e.g., rare stamps or jewels), in several books McGee is asked to locate a missing person; in one, the stolen property is a client&#x27;s reputation. In several instances, he shows a marked propensity to exact revenge, usually for the ill-treatment or death of one of his close friends.

Physically, McGee is a tall, tanned, sandy-haired man with pale gray eyes. Several books hint (or explicitly state) that he is a U.S. Army veteran of the Korean War. However, later books are less precise about exactly when he served. In two of the later novels, &quot;The Green Ripper&quot; and &quot;Cinnamon Skin&quot;, there are implications that his military service was during the Vietnam War rather than the Korean. In &quot;The Lonely Silver Rain&quot;, he visits a bank safe-deposit box in which he keeps a few precious keepsakes, including photos of his father, mother, and brother, &quot;all long dead,&quot; and he mentions that the box also contains his Silver Star, Purple Heart, and honorable discharge certificate, all awarded by the U.S. Army to &quot;Sergeant McGee.&quot; He also has a daughter named Jean, unknown to him until she reveals herself in &quot;The Lonely Silver Rain&quot; as the result of a long-ago love affair. He was a standout college football player (a defensive linebacker.), but says in &quot;A Deadly Shade of Gold&quot; that he never played professional football due to a knee injury. However, in &quot;The Turquoise Lament&quot; he admits to a sports trivia fan that he played professional football for a couple of seasons before his knees were wrecked in a tackle by an opponent from the Detroit Lions.

Despite his age, he retains the quickness and agility of a professional athlete. He stands 6′4″ (1.93 m) tall and, although deceptively unimposing at his &quot;fighting weight&quot; of 205 pounds (93 kg), he is much stronger than he looks, with thick wrists and long arms; occasionally, a more perspicacious adversary notes these features when deciding whether to tangle with him. McGee purposely cultivates an image of being uncoordinated, shambling, and clumsy, but has superb reflexes and muscle memory. He has a 33-inch waist, wears a size 46 long jacket, and a shirt with a ″ neck and 34″ arms. McGee often discusses his fitness regimen, usually in terms of regaining his fitness after a lazy period: swimming and sprinting are frequently mentioned. At one time, he was a pipe smoker, but eventually gave it up in order to maintain his physical fitness. As a martial arts strategy, he often covers his face and blocks punches with his arms and elbows to lull and tire his opponent while studying that opponent&#x27;s fighting style. In the final novel, McGee is described as practicing the Chinese art of t&#x27;ai chi ch&#x27;uan.

McGee&#x27;s early life and family are deliberately left undeveloped. Among the few explicit mentions of family are a memory of attending a Chicago parade with his father as a boy, and a brother with whom he planned to go into business after his military service. The brother was apparently swindled out of his savings in a scam involving a woman and a male accomplice and committed suicide; it is strongly hinted that Travis subsequently killed the woman and her partner. McGee&#x27;s ethnicity is Irish-American; his father&#x27;s first name is never given, but his mother&#x27;s maiden name is given as Mary Catherine Devlin.

While McGee notes in &quot;Free Fall in Crimson&quot; (1981) that he has a history of womanizing, having &quot;cut a wide swath through a wall of female flesh,&quot; he is honest and cynical enough to understand what this says about himself. This is a part of his introspective nature that frequently appears throughout the series, with observations about society around him, with particular notice paid to the changing Florida environment. McGee&#x27;s cynical image of himself, some variation of which appears in every book in the series, is as a knight in rusty armor with a broken lance and swaybacked steed, fighting for what he fears are outdated or unrealistic ideals—these are clearly allusions to Don Quixote. In his romantic view of the world (as well as several other similarities), he bears a resemblance to Robert B. Parker&#x27;s Spenser.

Professor Hugh Merrill, MacDonald&#x27;s biographer, suggests that despite McGee being squarely in the hardboiled tradition, the character is nonetheless a marked departure from the typical protagonists in the genre by being a gregarious and essentially likable person rather than a loner. Unlike other fictional detectives such as Raymond Chandler&#x27;s jaded and world-weary Philip Marlowe, McGee clings to what is important to him: his senses of honor, obligation, and outrage. In a classic commentary in &quot;Bright Orange for the Shroud&quot;, McGee muses:

Now, of course, having failed in every attempt to subdue the Glades by frontal attack, we are slowly killing it off by tapping the River of Grass. In the questionable name of progress, the state in its vast wisdom lets every two-bit developer divert the flow into drag-lined canals that give him &quot;waterfront&quot; lots to sell. As far north as Corkscrew Swamp, virgin stands of ancient bald cypress are dying. All the area north of Copeland had been logged out, and will never come back. As the glades dry, the big fires come with increasing frequency. The ecology is changing with egret colonies dwindling, mullet getting scarce, mangrove dying of new diseases born of dryness.

This was in a paperback originally published in 1965, when the general public was still not conversant with the concept of environmentalism.

McGee does have a sidekick of sorts in his best friend Meyer, an internationally known and respected economist who lives on a cabin cruiser of his own near McGee&#x27;s at Bahia Mar, the &quot;John Maynard Keynes&quot;, and later, after the &quot;Keynes&quot; is blown up, aboard its replacement, the &quot;Thorstein Veblen&quot;. There has been some confusion as to whether Meyer is a given name or surname, but it is clear in &quot;The Green Ripper&quot; when McGee and Meyer are in the hotel room with two federal agents. They refer to him twice as Dr. Meyer and at the second, he says, &quot;Just Meyer, please.&quot; In &quot;Pale Gray for Guilt&quot;, Meyer presents a business card giving his name as &quot;G. Ludweg Meyer,&quot; and a letter of introduction beginning &quot;My Dear Ludweg.&quot; Whether these show his real name or not is obscured by both items being instruments in an elaborate financial con game. Both of Meyer&#x27;s boats are jammed full of books and treatises, ranging far beyond simple economic theory. For instance, Meyer is a chess aficionado and amateur psychologist. Meyer serves as McGee&#x27;s anchor when McGee&#x27;s own inner compass seems to be skewed, as well as providing the formal education that the street-smart McGee lacks. Meyer has been known to participate in McGee&#x27;s campaigns on occasion and has come close to being killed more than once as a result. His cover is usually as some sort of academic, though at times he has also played a stockbroker or an entomologist.

Some world-weariness does eventually creep into McGee&#x27;s character, perhaps because the 1960s Florida in which he originated no longer exists. The only direct indications of his age ever given are comments that he had served in the Korean War and, until the 1980s, he seems ageless. He does at one point refer to having a &quot;birthday ending in zero,&quot; which could mean that he was born in 1930. But as the series progresses, minor recurring characters began to drop away and it becomes apparent that McGee himself is getting older, along with his creator. In later novels such as &quot;The Green Ripper&quot; and &quot;Free Fall in Crimson&quot;, there is a sense of desperation that the violence in the world is too senseless to be explained and will never end. Much of that dissipates with the ending of &quot;The Lonely Silver Rain&quot;, which became the final volume when MacDonald died in 1986. (Reports of another final McGee novel, possibly narrated by Meyer, titled &quot;A Black Border for McGee&quot; and to be published posthumously, have never been confirmed.)

== About the Travis McGee novels ==
MacDonald was already a prolific author of mystery and suspense novels when he decided to create a series character. McGee originally was to be called Dallas McGee, after the city, but after the Kennedy assassination, MacDonald decided that name had too many negative connotations. He was searching for a first name for McGee when a friend suggested that he look at the names of the many Air Force bases in California. MacDonald&#x27;s attention was caught by Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, and so he named his character Travis.

Beginning with &quot;The Deep Blue Good-by&quot;, released in March 1964, each of the 21 McGree novels has a title that incorporates a color. The first three books in the series were published in quick succession, at the rate of one a month, a highly unusual publishing strategy. According to MacDonald, he had earlier written an introductory novel about McGee that he burned as being unsatisfactory. A longtime resident of Sarasota&#x27;s Siesta Key, MacDonald said he placed McGee on the opposite side of the state to protect his privacy in case the series became popular.

McGee has been called the first great modern Florida adventurer, preceding characters and situations that appeared in novels by authors such as Elmore Leonard, Carl Hiaasen, Paul Levine, Tim Dorsey, James W. Hall, and Les Standiford. Hiaasen specifically acknowledged his debt in an introduction he wrote for a new edition of &quot;The Deep Blue Good-by&quot; in 1994, commenting that even though MacDonald was then eight years gone, he believed McGee was still around, probably sipping gin on the deck of the &quot;Busted Flush&quot; and pondering whatever it was that Florida had become or was becoming. Singer/songwriter Jimmy Buffett expressed similar sentiments in the lyrics of the song &quot;Incommunicado.&quot; In &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; by Stephen King, County Sheriff Homer McCaslin berates author Ben Mears&#x27;s writing. McCaslin tells him to write &quot;Like the guy who writes those Travis McGee stories.&quot;

The U.S. Library of Congress&#x27;s Center for the Book commissioned a short work by MacDonald. The resulting essay, &quot;Reading for Survival,&quot; is a conversation between McGee and Meyer on the importance of reading. The 26-page essay was released in a limited edition of 5,000 copies and was available for a small contribution to the Center for the Book.

Mystery novelist Lee Child wrote the introduction for the Random House Trade Paperback Edition of &quot;The Deep Blue Good-by&quot; published in 2013.

In addition, the 1966 MacDonald novel &quot;The Last One Left&quot; carries the author&#x27;s inscription, &quot;I dedicate this novel to TRAVIS McGEE, who lent invaluable support and encouragement.&quot; With much of the action occurring in the boat cruising world of southeastern Florida, it is similar to some of the McGee stories. The book also mentions the &quot;Muñequita&quot;, a small runabout that McGee later buys in &quot;Pale Gray for Guilt&quot;.

It has been rumored for years that MacDonald was planning a 22nd book to be titled &quot;A Black Border for McGee&quot; about the death of his famous character and told from the point of view of his friend Meyer. The MacDonald family has steadfastly denied the rumors and has consistently and vigorously refused offers from other authors to continue the series, feeling that no one could properly capture the tone and voice of MacDonald and McGee.

== Adaptations ==

McGee has twice been translated to cinema and television: Rod Taylor played McGee in &quot;Darker Than Amber&quot; (1970) and Sam Elliott played him in the television movie of &quot;The Empty Copper Sea&quot;, entitled &quot;Travis McGee&quot; (1983). The latter relocates McGee in California, eliminating the Florida locales central to the novels. In addition, Elliott kept his trademark brushy mustache, thoroughly distancing himself from the clean-shaven, brush-cut look McGee maintains in the books. In the first film, Meyer was played by Theodore Bikel; in the second, by Gene Evans.

In 1967, author MacDonald refused permission for a television series about Travis McGee and his cases, feeling people would stop reading the novels were McGee regularly on television. Comedian Dan Rowan, a friend of MacDonald&#x27;s, had expressed interest in playing the role, but nothing ever materialized.

Robert Petkoff provided the voice of Travis McGee in the majority of the current audio book versions of the novels. The prior abridged series from Random House audio featured Darren McGavin in all but two, &quot;Darker Than Amber&quot; and &quot;Cinnamon Skin&quot;, which were read by Kevin Conway.

A film version of &quot;The Deep Blue Good-by&quot;, directed by Oliver Stone with Leonardo DiCaprio as McGee, was in development with a tentative release date of 2011 or 2012. In April 2010, it was announced that the film&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Travis McGee&quot;. In April 2011, it was announced that Paul Greengrass was interested in directing the film, but in March 2014, James Mangold was attached to direct the film, which DiCaprio would produce along with Jennifer Davisson-Killoran and Amy Robinson. Dana Stevens and Kario Salem wrote the first draft. It was revealed that Christian Bale was slated to play the title role for the film &quot;The Deep Blue Good-by&quot; with a screenplay by Dennis Lehane, but these plans fell through due to Bale having a knee injury.

== Literary landmark ==
When the U.S. organization Friends of Libraries U.S.A. decided to institute a series of literary landmark plaques analogous to historic landmark markers, the first to be installed was around what would be Slip F-18 in Bahia Mar, the anchorage of the &quot;Busted Flush&quot;. This was done in February 1987, less than a year after MacDonald&#x27;s death.

After the remodeling of the Bahia Mar Yachting Center in 2003 to replace fixed docks with floating docks, there no longer existed a Slip F-18. The plaque was remounted on a movable wooden base, which is presently located inside the marina Dockmaster&#x27;s Office and Gift Shop.

<text>DirectFB (Direct Frame Buffer), now continued as DirectFB2, is a software library with a small memory footprint that provides graphics acceleration, input device handling and abstraction layer, and integrated windowing system with support for translucent windows and multiple display layers on top of the Linux framebuffer without requiring any kernel modifications. DirectFB is free and open-source software subject to the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

The library allows developers an alternative to a full X Window System (X11) server used in Unix-like operating systems. DirectFB allows applications to talk directly to video hardware through a direct API, speeding up and simplifying graphic operations.

It is often used by games and embedded systems developers to circumvent the overhead of a full X Window System server implementation. In 2006, a version of DirectFB was included in the software stack for the CE Linux Forum&#x27;s Audio/Video Graphics Specification V2.

DirectFB can host XDirectFB, a rootless X server implementation that uses DirectFB windows for X11 top-level windows. XDirectFB is an interface that mimics the X11 interface through the DirectFB API to simplify running applications written for X11 on DirectFB.

DirectFBGL is an OpenGL extension for DirectFB/XDirectFB that uses Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) in the Mesa 3D library to support OpenGL hardware acceleration.

Among the products that use DirectFB are LinuxTV, Ben Nanonote, the unreleased Palm Foleo mobile companion, the webOS operating system, Panasonic Viera Connect TVs and the Philips TVs based on jointSPACE.
