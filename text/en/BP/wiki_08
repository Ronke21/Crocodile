<text>Glacier Peak or Dakobed (known in the Sauk-Suiattle dialect of the Lushootseed language as &quot;Tda-ko-buh-ba&quot; or &quot;Takobia&quot;) is the most isolated of the five major stratovolcanoes (composite volcanoes) of the Cascade Volcanic Arc in the U.S state of Washington. Located in the Glacier Peak Wilderness in Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest, the volcano is visible from the west in Seattle, and from the north in the higher areas of eastern suburbs of Vancouver such as Coquitlam, New Westminster and Port Coquitlam. The volcano is the fourth tallest peak in Washington state, and not as much is known about it compared to other volcanoes in the area. Local Native Americans have recognized Glacier Peak and other Washington volcanoes in their histories and stories. When American explorers reached the region, they learned basic information about surrounding landforms, but did not initially understand that Glacier Peak was a volcano. Positioned in Snohomish County, the volcano is only northeast of downtown Seattle. From locations in northern Seattle and northward, Glacier Peak is closer than the more famous Mount Rainier (Tahoma), but as Glacier Peak is set farther into the Cascades and almost shorter, it is much less noticeable than Mount Rainier.

Glacier Peak is one of the most active of Washington&#x27;s volcanoes. The volcano formed during the Pleistocene epoch, about one million years ago, and since the most recent ice age, it has produced some of the largest and most explosive eruptions in the state. When continental ice sheets retreated from the region, Glacier Peak began to erupt regularly, erupting explosively five times in the past 3,000 years. It has erupted repeatedly during at least six periods; two of these eruptions have been among the largest in Washington.

== Geology ==
Remnants of past (prehistoric) lava domes are main components of the summit of the volcano, in addition to its false summit, Disappointment Peak. Past pyroclastic flow deposits are easily visible in river valleys near the volcano, likely caused by lava dome collapse, along with ridges found east of the summit consisting of ash cloud remains. On its western flank, the volcano also has a lahar, or mudflow deposit, which runs for about into the White Chuck River Valley around 14,000 years ago. Ten other pyroclastic flow deposits are visible, all identified as relatively 10,000 years old. There is also a considerably newer mudflow, about 5,500 years old, which covers an area of between the same river valley, along with two small incidents both under 3,000 years old. Another lahar, of unidentified age, was rich in oxyhornblende dacite; and continued for into the Sauk River.

There are also ash cloud deposits on the opposite eastern flank of the volcano. Studies of the mountain have to date been unable to find any correspondence with pyroclastic flows, but several past mudflows have been identified. In the Dusty Creek valley, which runs east from the mountain, there is a lahar at least thick, containing pyroclastic flow deposits and other mudflows. However, this large mudflow is part of a concentration of past incidents at the volcano that spans the Dusty Creek and Chocolate Creek valleys. The area contains at least of lithic debris. Tephra deposits are for the most part constrained to the left flank of the volcano, and at least nine past incidents have been identified. These form several layers of tephra constructing the mountain. Smaller eruptions involving tephra occurred between 6,900 and 5,500 years ago, again between 3,450 and 200 years ago, and as recently as 316 to 90 years ago.

On the mountain, about up, are three additional cinder cones — one at the head of White Chuck River, one at Dishpan Gap, and one near Indian Pass. The volcano has also created thermal features such as hot springs. There were three hot springs on the mountain: Gamma, Kennedy, and Sulphur, but Kennedy Hot Springs was destroyed and buried in a slide.

=== Tectonic setting ===

The volcano is located in Washington, and is one of the five major stratovolcanoes there. Situated in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, the volcano was created by subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate. Convergence between the two continues at a rate of per year. This range has been volcanically active for about 36 million years, and the rocks that make up its volcanoes are between 55 and 42 million years old. Eruptions within the range are irregular and do not occur all at once. In an attempt to organize the volcanoes by age, scientists typically divide them into the High Cascades, younger volcanoes, and the Western Cascades, consisting of the older volcanoes. However, the vents in Washington are all of different ages so none of its volcanoes are included in either of the sections.

== History ==
Around the area, there were many Native Americans, and along with other Washington volcanoes, the mountain was recognized by them as a spirit. When European-American explorers reached the area, they learned about the mountain, though only partially, through local legends. Although the local people described Glacier Peak as a vital part of their storytelling and beliefs, when other volcanoes in the area were mapped, Glacier Peak was left out. In 1850 natives mentioned the volcano to naturalist George Gibbs saying that the volcano had once &quot;smoked&quot;. In 1898 the volcano was finally documented on a map.

Native Americans also used the area around the Cascades for their agriculture, leading them to often congregate in the region. As a result, gold miners eventually reached the area in the 1870s–1890s, searching for resources and rich land. The first white man recorded to observe the mountain—Daniel Lindsley—was an employee of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company searching for possible railroad routes when he saw it in 1870.

== Eruptive history ==

Despite its elevation of , Glacier Peak is a small stratovolcano. Its relatively high summit is a consequence of its location atop a high ridge, but its volcanic portion extends only above the underlying ridge. Another Cascade Arc volcano with similar geomorphology is the Mount Meager massif in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, which is situated on a ridge of nonvolcanic, crystalline and metamorphic rock.
Of the five major volcanoes in Washington, only Glacier Peak and Mount St. Helens have had large eruptions in the past 15,000 years. Since both volcanoes generate magma of dacitic origin, the viscous magma builds up since it cannot flow through the eruptive vent. Gradually, the pressure grows, culminating in an explosion that ejects materials such as tephra, which in its simplest form, is ash.

Tephrochronology and radiocarbon dating indicate that Glacier Peak eruptions occurred in 1700 AD ± 100 years, 1300 AD ± 300 years, 900 AD ± 50 years, 200 AD ± 50 years, 850 BC, 3150 BC, and in 3550 BC. The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) for three of these was 2 to 4, small compared to the 5 of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. They were characterized mainly by a central vent eruption, followed by an explosive eruption. These eruptions varied in outcome; some produced lahars, some pyroclastic flows, and others lava domes. The volcano has had one eruption with a VEI of 2, one with a VEI of 4, and possibly another with a VEI of 3.

A little more than 13,000 years ago, a sequence of nine tephra eruptions occurred within a period of less than a few hundred years. Associated with these eruptions were pyroclastic flows. Mixed with snow, ice and water, these formed lahars that raced into three nearby rivers, filling their valleys with deep deposits. Subsequently, the mudflows drained into both the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River (at that time an outlet of the Sauk River) and Skagit Rivers. In Arlington, downstream, lahars deposited seven feet of sediment. Subsequent erosion of lahar deposits near Darrington led to the current river system with the Stillaguamish River separated from the Sauk/Skagit Rivers. Lahar debris was deposited along both the Skagit and Stillaguamish Rivers all the way to Puget Sound. A small portion of the erupted tephra was deposited locally. However, most of the tephra reached higher levels of the atmosphere, and was transported by the wind hundreds of miles. Deposits from this congregation were as thick as near Chelan and near Missoula, Montana. The table below shows the three largest eruptions from this sequence.
Since these events, Glacier Peak has produced several lahars. The largest mudflows were 5,900 and 1,800 years ago and were associated with dome-building eruptions. In both cases, the lahars traveled down the Skagit River to Puget Sound.

=== Hazards ===

The risk of an eruption in any given year is currently estimated as 1 in 1,000. , Glacier Peak is classified as one of the 18 most dangerous volcanoes in the United States.

When lahars reach populated areas, they can bury structures and people. An example was the Armero tragedy at Nevado del Ruiz where 23,000 died from an enormous mudflow. Lahars from Glacier Peak pose a similar threat to the small communities of Darrington, Arlington, and Concrete with a lesser threat to the larger and rapidly growing towns of Mount Vernon and Burlington, as well as other communities along the lower Skagit and Stillaguamish Rivers. A 2005 study conducted by the United States Geological Survey identified nine Cascade volcanoes, including Glacier Peak, as &quot;very-high-threat volcanoes with inadequate monitoring&quot;. At the time of the study, only one seismometer was installed on Glacier Peak that had not &quot;worked in two years&quot;. , the PNSN still operates only one seismometer on Glacier Peak.

In 2018, the USGS applied to add four more stations, but regulations protecting federal wilderness areas prohibit the use of helicopters that are needed to transport materials; advocacy groups opposed an exemption for the project and filed objections. In 2019, Congress passed the National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System Act to authorize more monitoring stations, but did not include funding to construct them. Permits were granted by the U.S. Forest Service in June 2022.

== Climate ==
=== Glaciers ===

Eleven significant glaciers cover Glacier Peak. When C.E. Rusk first saw these glaciers in 1906 they were beginning to retreat, but were still very advanced. The average retreat of Glacier Peak glaciers from the Little Ice Age to the 1958 positions was . Richard Hubley noted that North Cascade glaciers began to advance in the early 1950s, after 30 years of rapid retreat. The advance was in response to a sharp rise in winter precipitation and a decline in summer temperature beginning in 1944. Ten of the fifteen glaciers around Glacier Peak advanced, including all of the glaciers directly on the mountain&#x27;s slopes. Advances of Glacier Peak glaciers ranged from and culminated in 1978. All eleven Glacier Peak glaciers that advanced during the 1950–79 period emplaced identifiable maximum advance terminal moraines. From 1984 to 2005, the average retreat of eight Glacier Peak glaciers from their recent maximum positions was . Milk Lake Glacier, on the north flank of the mountain, melted away altogether in the 1990s.

== Recreation ==
The Pacific Crest Trail passes near Glacier Peak. The Suiattle River crossing is a well-known feature on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) as it passes through the area. The Suiattle PCT crossing used to have a bridge crossing until it was flooded out by storms in late 2003.

The first recorded person to climb the mountain was Thomas Gerdine, along with a group of United States Geological Survey scientists, Sam Strom, A. H. Dubor, and Darcy Bard, in 1897. The climb is Alpine Grade I or II.

The easiest ski route is about of walking along the White Chuck River Trail (Forest Service Trail No. 643) and up the Sitkum Glacier. The trail is reached via Forest Service Road No. 23. The Sitkum Glacier ski route is rated blue to black diamond for both the ascent and the descent.

The Seattle-based composer, Alan Hovhaness, dedicated his Symphony no.66 as &quot;Hymn to Glacier Peak&quot;: see Symphony no.66 (Hovhaness).

The non-fiction book &quot;Encounters with the Archdruid&quot; by John McPhee, which portrays the environmental advocacy of David Brower, devotes the first of its three main sections to a conflict over mineral prospecting around Glacier Peak.

<doc id="467475" wikidata="Q313449" url="?curid=467475" title="Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev">
<text>Zelimkhan Abdulmuslimovich Yandarbiyev () also spelled Yandarbiev; 12 September 1952 – 13 February 2004) was a Chechen writer and politician who was the second president of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria between 1996 and 1997. In 2004, Yandarbiyev was assassinated while he was on mission to recognize Chechnya’s right for independence in Qatar.

==Life==
Yandarbiyev was originally a literary scholar, poet, and children&#x27;s literature writer, having studied at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow and co-founding a clandestine literature club which would eventually be banned by the Soviet authorities.

Years later, Yandarbiyev became a leader in the Chechen nationalist movement as the Soviet Union began to collapse. In July 1989, he founded the Bart (Unity) Party, a democratic party that promoted the unity of Caucasian ethnic groups against Russian imperialism and terrorism. In May 1990, he founded and led the Vainakh Democratic Party (VDP), the first Chechen political party, which was committed to an independent Chechnya. The VDP initially represented both Chechen and Ingush until their split after Chechnya&#x27;s declaration of independence from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. 

In November 1990, he became the deputy chairman of the newly formed All-National Congress of the Chechen People (NCChP), which was led by Dzhokhar Dudayev and which ousted the Soviet-era leadership. With Dudayev, he signed an agreement with Ingush leaders splitting the joint Chechen-Ingush republic in two. In the first Chechen parliament, from 1991 to 1993, Yandarbiyev headed the media committee. In April 1993 he was appointed as the Vice President of Ichkeria by Dudayev.

In April 1996, following the assassination of his predecessor Dzhokhar Dudayev, he became the Acting President of Ichkeria. In late May 1996, Yandarbiyev headed a Chechen delegation that met President of Russia Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister of Russia Viktor Chernomyrdin for peace talks at the Kremlin that resulted in the signature of a ceasefire agreement on 27 May 1996.

In 1997, during the signing of the Russian-Chechen Peace Treaty in Moscow, Yandarbiyev famously forced Russian President Yeltsin to change seats at a negotiating table so he would be received like a head of sovereign state. Yandarbiyev stood in the presidential election held in Chechnya in February 1997, but was defeated by the Chechen separatist top military leader, General Aslan Maskhadov, getting 10 per cent of the votes and landing third behind Maskhadov and Shamil Basayev. Together with Maskhadov, Yandarbiyev took part in signing of the &quot;lasting&quot; peace treaty in Moscow.

The two Chechen leaders fell out badly the following year, when Yandarbiyev was accused of being behind an assassination attempt against Maskhadov. In September 1998, Maskhadov publicly denounced Yandarbiyev, accusing him of importing the Islamic extremist philosophy of &quot;Wahhabism&quot; and of being responsible for &quot;anti-state activities&quot; including anti-government speeches and public meetings, as well as the organisation of illegal armed groups. Yandarbiyev subsequently joined forces with the hard-line Islamist opposition to Maskhadov&#x27;s rule.

In August–September 1999, Yandarbiyev was assumed as a key figure behind the invasion by the Islamic International Brigade-led coalition of Islamist guerrillas on the neighboring Russian Republic of Dagestan. At the beginning of the Second Chechen War, Yandarbiyev traveled abroad to Afghanistan, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates and eventually settled in Qatar in 1999, where he sought to obtain Muslim support for the Chechen cause.

After being accused of involvement in the October 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis, Yandarbiyev was placed on Interpol&#x27;s most wanted list and Russia made the first of several requests for extradition in February 2003, citing Yandarbiyev as a major international terrorist and financier of the al-Qaeda-backed Chechen resistance. In June 2003, his name was consequently added to the United Nations Security Council Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee&#x27;s blacklist of al-Qaeda-related suspects.

Yandarbiyev played a key role in directing funding from foundations in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf in order to support a radical Chechen faction dubbed the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment, a militant group responsible for the Moscow theater hostage crisis. In January 2004, he was interviewed extensively in Qatar for the BBC Four documentary &quot;The Smell of Paradise&quot;, where the film-makers called him the &quot;spiritual leader of the Chechens and a poet on the road to jihad.&quot;

==Assassination==

On 13 February 2004, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev was killed when a bomb ripped through his SUV in the Qatari capital, Doha. He was fatally wounded and succumbed to his injuries on the way to the hospital. His 13-year-old son, Daud, was in critical condition but survived. Some reports also added that two of his bodyguards were killed in the blast as well, but this has not been confirmed.

It was initially unclear who was responsible for the blast, but suspicion immediately fell on Russian intelligence agencies SVR and GRU, both of which denied any involvement, and cited internal feuding among the Chechen rebel leadership. Aslan Maskhadov&#x27;s separatist foreign ministry condemned the attack as a &quot;Russian terrorist attack&quot;, comparing it to the 1996 attack that killed Dzhokhar Dudayev. The car bomb eventually led to Qatar&#x27;s first counterterrorism law, declaring lethal terrorist acts punishable by death or life imprisonment.

The day after the attack, Qatari authorities arrested three Russians in a Russian embassy villa. One of them, the first secretary of the Russian Embassy in Qatar, Aleksandr Fetisov, was released in March due to his diplomatic status. The remaining two, GRU agents Anatoly Yablochkov (also known as Belashkov) and Vasily Pugachyov (sometimes misspelled as Bogachyov), were charged with the assassination of Yandarbiyev, an assassination attempt of his son Daud Yandarbiyev, and smuggling weapons into Qatar. According to Moscow, Yablochkov and Pugachyov were secret intelligence agents sent to the Russian Embassy in Doha to collect information about global terrorism. Russia&#x27;s acting Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov pledged state support to the suspects and declared that their imprisonment was illegal. There were some speculations that Fetisov had been released in exchange for Qatari wrestlers detained in Moscow.

The trial proceedings were closed to the public after the defendants claimed that the Qatari police had tortured them in the first days after their arrest, when they had been held incommunicado; the two Russians alleged that they had suffered beatings, sleep deprivation and attacks by guard dogs. Based on these torture allegations and that the two officers were arrested within an extraterritorial compound belonging to the Russian Embassy, Russia demanded the immediate release of its citizens. They were represented by the attorney of the law firm founded by Nikolai Yegorov, a friend and fellow student of Vladimir Putin at Leningrad State University.

The Qatari prosecutors concluded that the suspects had received the order to eliminate Zelimkhan Yandarbiev from then Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov personally.

On 30 June 2004, both Russians were sentenced to life imprisonment; passing the sentence, the judge stated that they had acted on orders from the Russian leadership.

The verdict of the Doha court caused severe tensions between Qatar and Russia, and, on 23 December 2004, Qatar agreed to extradite the prisoners to Russia, where they would serve out their life sentences. The agents however received a heroes&#x27; welcome on returning to Moscow on the same day but disappeared from public view shortly afterwards.

Russian prison authorities admitted in February 2005 that they were not in prison and said that the sentence in Qatar was &quot;irrelevant&quot; in Russia.

<text>Three Fingered Jack is a summit of a shield volcano of the Cascade Range in the U.S. state of Oregon. Formed during the Pleistocene epoch, the mountain consists mainly of basaltic andesite lava and was heavily glaciated in the past. While other Oregon volcanoes that were heavily glaciated—such as Mount Washington and Mount Thielsen—display eroded volcanic necks, Three Fingered Jack&#x27;s present summit is a comparatively narrow ridge of loose tephra supported by a dike only thick on a generally north–south axis. Glaciation exposed radiating dikes and plugs that support this summit. The volcano has long been inactive and is highly eroded.

Three Fingered Jack has diverse flora, fauna, and fungi. The Molala people, one of the indigenous groups in the northwestern United States, historically inhabited the area around the volcano. Not much is known about Molala culture, other than that the group fished for salmon and collected berries, fruits, obsidian, and dried herbs. David Douglas was the first person of non-indigenous descent to reach the area in 1825, followed by Peter Skene Ogden the following year. The first group to ascend the volcano reached its summit in September 1923. Three Fingered Jack can still be climbed, but climbers can require rescue after becoming disoriented in low visibility conditions.

== Geography ==

Three Fingered Jack lies in the U.S. state of Oregon, in Linn and Jefferson counties. It has a volume of and a summit elevation of , with a proximal topographic relief of and a draping relief of . Its jagged edifice rises between Mount Jefferson and the Three Sisters volcanic complex. Three Fingered Jack lies within the Mount Jefferson Wilderness and is only accessible on foot by trails such as the Pacific Crest Trail. Located about northwest of the city of Sisters, it is a prominent landmark in the area.

=== Physical geography ===
Lateral and terminal moraines formed on Three Fingered Jack during the last major advance of glacial ice in the area during the Wisconsin glaciation, along with glacial striations, altered vegetation patterns, and lithologies that suggest glacial transport of material. Jack Glacier (unofficially-named) is the sole glacier remaining on the volcano, located in a shaded cirque on the northeast side. The glacier resides at an unusually low altitude for the central Oregon Cascades it is protected by tall ridges to the south and west. Jack Glacier has an area of , though historically it has reached estimated areas of up to . It is likely stagnant. During the Little Ice Age, which spanned roughly 1350 to 1850, the glacier produced moraines with heights close to , which are dotted with of ash from the Sand Mountain cinder cone chain and of ash from the Blue Lake Crater cinder cone.

The moraine for Jack Glacier dammed a lake with a volume of , a surface area of , and a maximum depth of . This lake was documented in 1937, although it did not appear on United States Geological Survey topographic maps made during the 1920s. The lake sits precariously; moraines on the volcano are steep, unstable, and populated with boulders. Before September 1960, there was a partial breach of this moraine-dammed lake that covered an area of near the moraine&#x27;s base. Since 1960, there have been at least three incidents in which moraine-dammed lakes on the volcano have caused floods down the slopes, including a significant flood and debris flow in 2012. Local soil is thin, and it has been buried by a layer of weathered Holocene tephra from Three Fingered Jack, which has a maximum thickness of .

== Ecology ==
Douglas fir, Alpine fir, blue spruce, mountain hemlock, and bear grass can be found along the volcano and its hiking trails. Cascade parsley fern grows on Three Fingered Jack between elevations of . There are also mountain goats in the surrounding wilderness area.

Carnivorous animals in the surrounding area include American black bears, coyotes, cougars, red foxes, raccoons, American martens, stoats (also known as ermines), long-tailed weasels, American minks, North American river otters, and bobcats. Deer species include Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, and mule deer; insectivores include vagrant shrews, American water shrews, and coast moles. Bats at Jefferson include little brown bats and silver-haired bats, and American pikas and snowshoe hares are also present. Rodents such as yellow-bellied marmots, mountain beavers, yellow-pine chipmunks, Townsend&#x27;s chipmunks, golden-mantled ground squirrels, western gray squirrels, Douglas squirrels, mountain pocket gophers, North American beavers, deer mice, bushy-tailed woodrats, water voles, Pacific jumping mice, and North American porcupines are present.

Birds nearby include mallards, northern goshawks, sharp-shinned hawks, red-tailed hawks, dusky grouses, grey partridges, killdeers, spotted sandpipers, California gulls, band-tailed pigeons, great horned owls, mountain pygmy owls, common nighthawks, rufous hummingbirds, Northern flickers, pileated woodpeckers, yellow-bellied sapsuckers, hairy woodpeckers, and white-headed woodpeckers. Other bird species found in the area consist of Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, willow flycatchers, olive-sided flycatchers, tree swallows, Canada jays, Steller&#x27;s jays, common ravens, Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers, black-capped chickadees, mountain chickadees, chestnut-backed chickadees, red-breasted nuthatches, pygmy nuthatches, Eurasian treecreepers, American dippers, wrens, American robins, varied thrushes, hermit thrushes, Townsend&#x27;s solitaires, golden-crowned kinglets, ruby-crowned kinglets, water pipits, blue-headed vireos, western tanagers, Cassin&#x27;s finches, gray-crowned rosy finches, pine siskins, red crossbills, green-tailed towhees, dark-eyed juncos, white-crowned sparrows, golden-crowned sparrows, fox sparrows, and Lincoln&#x27;s sparrows. Long-toed salamanders, California giant salamanders, rough-skinned newts, tailed frogs, western toads, Pacific tree frogs, northern red-legged frogs, Oregon spotted frogs, pygmy short-horned lizards, common garter snakes, and northwestern garter snakes make up some of the amphibious and reptilian animals in the vicinity.

== Geology and subfeatures ==

Three Fingered Jack is a shield volcano, and it is part of the group of volcanoes known as Oregon&#x27;s Matterhorns, whose tall, pinnacle spires resemble the Matterhorn in Switzerland. The volcano (like Mount Thielsen, Mount Bailey, Diamond Peak, and Mount Washington) had a shorter lifespan than larger volcanoes in the Cascade Range, ceasing eruptive activity more than 100,000 years ago. Three Fingered Jack marks the northernmost point for this group. South of Mount Jefferson, the High Cascades of Oregon consist of a broad ridge produced by shield volcano activity and eruptions from cinder cones. Vents range from deeply eroded complexes to recently active volcanoes, with most of the region mantled by normally polarized rock produced within the past 730,000 years.

Three Fingered Jack is part of a group of more than 30 large shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes that form a segment of Pleistocene-to-Holocene-epoch volcanic vents that produced mafic lava (rich in magnesium and iron). Three Fingered Jack includes several overlapping cinder cones and composite cones over underlying lava flows from shield volcano activity. These volcanic edifices and their lava flow deposits cover an area of .

The major edifice, which consists of light gray, basaltic andesite lava flow deposits, sits to the west of the first tephra cone. Variegated pyroclastic rock is embedded among these flows. Element abundance analysis suggests that lava in the Three Fingered Jack area can be grouped into discrete units based on its source magma chamber, except for the Jorn Lake basalt produced by the underlying shield volcano and basaltic andesite erupted by Three Fingered Jack. Petrological analysis shows high and low pressures for the crystallization of these lava flow deposits, and that basaltic andesite was distinct from basalt due to longer fractionation times.

Though Three Fingered Jack does not have a high-level conduit-filling volcanic plug, its summit sits atop a pyroclastic cone. Another cone lies to the south of the major cone, and there are secondary craters on the sides, as well as radial dikes and volcanic plugs. Known subfeatures include two shield volcanoes, Maxwell Butte (less eroded than Three Fingered Jack) and Turpentine Peak, which have elevations of and , respectively. There are six additional known volcanic cones: Duffy Butte, at an elevation of ; Hogg Rock (a tuya), at an elevation of ; Marion Mountain, at an elevation of ; Red Butte, with an elevation of ; and Marion Peak and Saddle Mountain, which do not have elevations listed. Other shield volcanoes and cinder cones that were active during the Pleistocene epoch occur to the northwest and southwest.

The volcano has a long ridge that trends from north to south. It is highly eroded; shaped like a sawtooth, it consists of tephra deposits supported by a vertical dike with a thickness of . Erosion has been so extensive that climbers claim that the summit moves in the wind. During the Pleistocene epoch, glaciers exposed its inner contents, providing evidence for its eruptive history. Though it has not been dated by radiometric approaches, the volcano is likely between 500,000 and 250,000 years old, and has been carved out by at least three glacial periods.

== Eruptive history ==
Three Fingered Jack has an eruptive history similar to many High Cascade volcanoes. The first activity was the formation of a pyroclastic cone over shield volcanoes. Later eruptions formed a main volcanic cone from lava flows and more pyroclastic rock. There are dikes that radiate from a micronorite plug, which deformed tephra in the surrounding strata. The northern and southern flanks of Three Fingered Jack feature lava flows made of olivine and augite basalt.

Three Fingered Jack is estimated to be between 500,000 and 250,000 years old. It underwent more explosive eruptions as its eruptive history progressed, generating large amounts of tephra which created a loose, unconsolidated summit and upper cone. Lava flows near the summit have an average thickness of . Secondary volcanic craters produced lava flows and pyroclastic material, which traveled both north and south of the volcano. Cone-building eruptions ceased before the Pleistocene epoch&#x27;s glacial period, allowing the expanded glacial cover to remove most of the cone, especially on the eastern and northeastern sides.

During the ongoing Holocene epoch, there has been volcanic activity between the Three Sisters volcanoes and Three Fingered Jack. Such eruptive episodes have produced tephra and lava flows that cover several hundred square kilometers in the region. These eruptions occurred after the climactic eruption of Mount Mazama, which took place roughly 6,600 years ago.

== Human history ==

The Molala people traditionally inhabited the surrounding area. The Molala fished for salmon and collected berries, fruits, obsidian, and dried herbs. Their culture was not well documented. The first person of non-indigenous descent to reach the area was David Douglas in 1825, followed by Peter Skene Ogden the following year.

Sources disagree about the affiliation of the mountain&#x27;s first ascenders, some calling them &quot;the Boys from Bend,&quot; others saying they were members of the Mazamas mountaineering club. Nonetheless, a source written by one of these first ascenders clearly states who was in the party and when they climbed. Ervin McNeal, Phil Philbrook, Armin Furrer, Wilbur Watkins, Leo Harryman, and Ronald Sellars were the first to ascend Three Fingered Jack on September 3, 1923.

The origins of Three Fingered Jack&#x27;s name remain unclear. One account claims that the volcano received its name from Joaquin Murrieta, a gold miner and vaquero during the California Gold Rush also known as Three Fingered Jack. Others allege that the volcano was named after a trapper with less than five fingers on one of his hands.

== Recreation ==
Hikers can see Three Fingered Jack on trails surrounding the mountain. The Canyon Creek Meadows hiking trail begins at Jack Lake, progresses through the Mount Jefferson Wilderness, and runs for about . It has an elevation gain of , and is accessible to children and families. An additional connected hiking trail runs for another up the rocky glacial washout plain adjacent to the volcano, becoming steeper as it approaches Three Fingered Jack and gaining in elevation. The base can also be reached on Pacific Crest Trail which runs for round trip and offers views of the volcano and its summit lake. Moreover, the Three Fingered Jack loop trail runs for around the volcano, gaining in elevation.

When Three Fingered Jack&#x27;s face becomes foggy, climbers have become disoriented due to the low visibility conditions of climbing the mountain, requiring rescue.

The summit can be quite dangerous due steep cliffs and poor rock quality which can result in footing and hand holds giving way without warning. One such event occurred on July 19, 2020, resulting in the death of a hiker attempting to reach the summit.

<text>Sneakers (US) or trainers (UK), also known by a wide variety of other names, are shoes primarily designed for sports or other forms of physical exercise, but are also widely used for everyday casual wear.

They were popularized by companies such as Converse, Nike and Spalding in the mid 20th century. Like other parts of the global clothing industry, shoe manufacturing is heavily concentrated in Asia with nine in ten shoes produced there.

==Names==
Sneakers have gone by a variety of names, depending on geography and changing over the decades. The broader category inclusive of sneakers is athletic shoes. The term &#x27;athletic shoes&#x27; is typically used for shoes utilized for jogging or road running and indoor sports such as basketball, but tends to exclude shoes for sports played on grass such as association football and rugby football, which are generally known in North America as &quot;cleats&quot; and in British English as &quot;boots&quot; or &quot;studs&quot;.


The word &quot;sneaker&quot; is often attributed to American Henry Nelson McKinney, who was an advertising agent for N. W. Ayer &amp; Son. In 1917, he used the term because the rubber sole made the shoe&#x27;s wearer stealthy. The word was already in use at least as early as 1887, when the &quot;Boston Journal&quot; made reference to &quot;sneakers&quot; as &quot;the name boys give to tennis shoes.&quot; The name &quot;sneakers&quot; originally referred to how quiet the rubber soles were on the ground, in contrast to noisy standard hard leather sole dress shoes. Someone wearing sneakers could &quot;sneak up&quot;, while someone wearing standards could not. Earlier, the name &quot;sneaks&quot; had been used by prison inmates to refer to warders (guards) because of the rubber-soled shoes they wore. The term &quot;sneakers&quot; is most commonly used in Northeastern United States, Central and South Florida, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Canada. However, in Australian, Canadian, and Scottish English, running shoes and runners are synonymous terms used to refer to sneakers, with the latter term also used in Hiberno-English. Tennis shoes and kicks are other terms used in Australian and North American English.

The British English equivalent of &quot;sneaker&quot; in its modern form is divided into two separate types: predominantly outdoor and fashionable trainers, training shoes or quality &#x27;basketball shoes&#x27; and in contrast cheap rubber-soled, low cut and canvas-topped plimsolls, daps, or flats. In Geordie English, sneakers may also be called sandshoes, gym boots, or joggers.

Several terms for sneakers exist in South Africa, including gym shoes, sports shoes and takkies. Other names for sneakers includes rubber shoes in Philippine English, track shoes in Singapore English, canvas shoes in Nigerian English, camboo (&quot;camp boot&quot;) in Ghana English, and sportex in Greece.

In Latvia, any sneakers are still called botas after the Czech footwear company Botas, whose produce was one of the few foreign brands of sneakers available during the Soviet occupation.

==History==

These shoes acquired the nickname &#x27;plimsoll&#x27; in the 1870s, derived according to Nicholette Jones&#x27; book &quot;The Plimsoll Sensation&quot;, from the colored horizontal band joining the upper to the sole, which resembled the Plimsoll line on a ship&#x27;s hull. Alternatively, just like the Plimsoll line on a ship, if water got above the line of the rubber sole, the wearer would get wet.

Plimsolls were widely worn by vacationers and also began to be worn by sportsmen on the tennis and croquet courts for their comfort. Special soles with engraved patterns to increase the surface grip of the shoe were developed, and these were ordered in bulk for the use of the British Army. Athletic shoes were increasingly used for leisure and outdoor activities at the turn of the 20th century - plimsolls were even found with the ill-fated Scott Antarctic expedition of 1911. Plimsolls were commonly worn by pupils in schools&#x27; physical education lessons in the UK from the 1950s until the early 1970s.

British company J.W. Foster and Sons designed and produced the first shoes designed for running in 1895; the shoes were spiked to allow for greater traction and speed. The company sold its high-quality handmade running shoes to athletes around the world, eventually receiving a contract for the manufacture of running shoes for the British team in the 1924 Summer Olympics. Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell won the 100 m and 400 m events, kitted out with Foster&#x27;s running gear.
This style of footwear also became prominent in America at the turn of the 20th century, where they were called &#x27;sneakers&#x27;. In 1892, the U.S. Rubber Company introduced the first rubber-soled shoes in the country, sparking a surge in demand and production. The first basketball shoes were designed by Spalding as early as 1907. The market for sneakers grew after World War I, when sports and athletics increasingly became a way to demonstrate moral fiber and patriotism. The U.S. market for sneakers grew steadily as young boys lined up to buy Converse All Stars sneakers endorsed by basketball player Chuck Taylor.

During the interwar period, athletic shoes began to be marketed for different sports, and differentiated designs were made available for men. Athletic shoes were used by competing athletes at the Olympics, helping to popularise them among the general public. In 1936, a French brand, Spring Court, marketed the first canvas tennis shoe featuring signature eight ventilation channels on a vulcanised natural rubber sole.

Adolf &quot;Adi&quot; Dassler began producing his own sports shoes in his mother&#x27;s wash kitchen in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, after his return from World War I, and went on to establish one of the leading athletic shoe manufacturers, Adidas. He also successfully marketed his shoes to athletes at the 1936 Summer Olympics, which helped cement his good reputation. Business boomed and the Dasslers were selling 200,000 pairs of shoes each year before World War II.

During the 1950s, leisure opportunities greatly expanded, and children and adolescents began to wear sneakers as school dress codes relaxed. Sneaker sales rose so high, they began to adversely affect the sales of conventional leather shoes, leading to a fierce advertising war for market share in the late &#x27;50s. In the 1970s, jogging for exercise became increasingly popular, and trainers designed specifically for comfort while jogging sold well. Companies also started to target some of their products at the casual fashion market. Soon, shoes were available for football, jogging, basketball, running, etc. Many sports had their relevant shoe, made possible by podiatrist development of athletic shoe technology.

During the 1990s, shoe companies perfected their fashion and marketing skills. Sports endorsements with famous athletes grew larger, and marketing budgets went through the roof. Sneakers became a fashion statement and were marketed as a definition of identity and personality rather than simply athletic aids.

Also during the 1990s, various vendors began producing &quot;walking shoes&quot; for adults using the construction technology of sneakers but visually resembling traditional leather shoes. The combination of a traditional look with increased comfort rapidly achieved wide popularity and by 2010 was displacing sales of leather shoes for adults in a parallel with the post-1950 success of sneakers among children. The shift was especially noticeable in combination with business-casual clothing.

From 1970 (five models), to 1998 (285 models), to 2012 (3,371), the number of sport shoe models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.

==Use in sports==
Sneakers intended for sports have a flexible sole, appropriate tread for the function, and ability to absorb impact. As the industry and designs have expanded, the term &quot;athletic shoes&quot; is based more on the design of the bottom of the shoe than the aesthetics of the top of the shoe. Today&#x27;s designs include sandals, Mary Janes, and even elevated styles suitable for running, dancing, and jumping.

The shoes themselves are made of flexible compounds, typically featuring a sole made of dense rubber. While the original design was basic, manufacturers have since tailored athletic shoes for their specific purposes. An example of this is the spiked shoe developed for track running. Some of these shoes are made up to unusually large sizes for athletes with large feet.

Sneakers intended for running come in a range of shapes suited to different purposes. Generally, they are divided by running style: the majority are for heel-toe joggers/runners which are further subdivided into &#x27;neutral&#x27;, &#x27;overpronation&#x27; and &#x27;underpronation&#x27;. However, most evidence-based comparisons show no reduction in lower-limb running injuries from prescribing different types of shoe for different foot types. The shoes are constructed with a complex structure of &quot;rubber&quot; with plastic/metal stiffeners to restrict foot movement. More advanced runners tend to wear flatter and flexible shoes, which allow them to run more quickly with greater comfort.

According to the NPD Group, one in four pairs of running shoes that were sold in the United States in 2016 were bought from an online retailer.

==Notable brands==
, brands with global popularity include:

== Culture ==
Sneakers have been an important part of hip hop (primarily Pumas, Nike, and Adidas) and rock &#x27;n roll (Converse, Vans) cultures since the 1970s. Hip hop artists sign million dollar deals with major brands such as Nike, Adidas, or Puma to promote their shoes. Sneaker collectors, called &quot;sneakerheads&quot;, regard sneakers as fashionable items. Sneaker companies encourage this trend by producing rare sneakers in limited numbers, often at very high retail prices. Artistically-modified sneakers can sell for upwards of $1000 at exclusive establishments like Saks Fifth Avenue. In 2005, a documentary, &quot;Just for Kicks&quot;, about the sneaker phenomenon and history was released.

==Sustainability==
Contemporary sneakers are largely made from synthetic materials, and the materials and manufacturing process produce, on average, about of CO2 emissions. Some companies are trying to substitute more sustainable materials in their manufacture. About 90% of shoes end up in landfills at end of life.

<text>Against Interpretation (often published as Against Interpretation and Other Essays) is a 1966 collection of essays by Susan Sontag. It includes some of Sontag&#x27;s best-known works, including &quot;Notes on &#x27;Camp&#x27;&quot;, &quot;On Style&quot; and the eponymous essay &quot;Against Interpretation.&quot; In the latter, Sontag argues that the new approach to criticism and aesthetics neglects the sensuous impact and novelty of art, instead fitting works into predetermined intellectual interpretations and emphasis on the &quot;content&quot; or &quot;meaning&quot; of a work. The book was a finalist for the Arts and Letters category of the National Book Award.

==Titular essay==
&quot;Against Interpretation&quot; is Sontag&#x27;s influential essay in &quot;Against Interpretation and Other Essays,&quot; which discusses the divisions between two different kinds of art criticism and theory: formalist interpretation and content-based interpretation. Sontag is strongly averse to what she considers to be contemporary interpretation, that is, an overabundance of importance placed upon the content or meaning of an artwork rather than being keenly alert to the sensuous aspects of a given work and developing a descriptive vocabulary for how it appears and how it does whatever it does. She believes that interpretation of the modern style has a particular &quot;taming&quot; effect: reducing the freedom of a subjective response and placing limitations or certain rules upon a responder. The modern style of interpretation is particularly despised by Sontag in relation to the previous classical style of interpretation that sought to &quot;bring artworks up to date&quot;, to meet modern interests and apply allegorical readings. Where this type of interpretation was seen to resolve conflict between past and present by revamping an art work and maintaining a certain level of respect and honour, Sontag believes that the modern style of interpretation has lost sensitivity and rather strives to &quot;excavate...destroy&quot; a piece of art.

Sontag asserts that the modern style is quite harmful to art and to audiences alike; enforcing hermeneutics – fallacious, complicated &quot;readings&quot; that seem to engulf an artwork, to the extent that analysis of content begins to degrade, to destroy. Reverting to a more primitive and sensual, almost magical experience of art is what Sontag desires; even though that is quite impossible due to the thickened layers of hermeneutics that surround interpretation of art and that have grown to be recognised and respected. Sontag daringly challenges Marxian and Freudian theories, claiming they are &quot;aggressive and impious&quot;.

Sontag also refers to the contemporary world as one of &quot;overproduction... material plentitude&quot; where one&#x27;s physical senses have been dulled and annihilated by mass production and complex interpretation to the extent that appreciation of the form of art has been lost. To Sontag, modernity means a loss of sensory experience and she believes (in corroboration with her theory of the damaging nature of criticism) that the pleasure of art is diminished by such overload of the senses. In this way, Sontag asserts that inevitably, the modern style of interpretation separates form and content in a manner that damages an artwork and one&#x27;s own sensorial appreciation of a piece.

Though she claims that interpretation can be &quot;stifling&quot;, making art comfortable and &quot;manageable&quot; and thus degrading the artist&#x27;s original intention, Sontag equally presents a solution to the dilemma she sees as an abundance of interpretation on content. That is, to approach art works with a strong emphasis on form, to &quot;reveal the sensuous surface of art without mucking about in it.&quot;

The essay was first published in Volume 8, number 34 of &quot;Evergreen Review&quot; in December 1964.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review of the book, Benjamin DeMott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised &quot;Against Interpretation&quot; as &quot;a vivid bit of living history here and now, and at the end of the sixties it may well rank among the invaluable cultural chronicles of these years.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Miss Sontag has written a ponderable, vivacious, beautifully living and quite astonishingly American book.&quot; Brandon Robshaw of &quot;The Independent&quot; later observed, &quot;This classic collection of essays and criticism from the 1960s flatters the reader&#x27;s intelligence without being intimidating.&quot; He added, &quot;...the essays are unfailingly stimulating. Though they bear the stamp of their time, Sontag was remarkably prescient; her project of analysing popular culture as well as high culture, the Doors as well as Dostoevsky, is now common practice throughout the educated world. And the artists and intellectuals she discusses—Nietzsche, Camus, Godard, Barthes etc—demonstrate that she knew which horses to back.&quot;

In their introduction to &quot;Critique and Postcritique&quot; (2017), Rita Felski and Elizabeth S. Anker argue that the title essay from Sontag&#x27;s collection has played an important role in the field of postcritique, a movement within literary criticism and cultural studies that attempts to find new forms of reading and interpretation that go beyond the methods of critique, critical theory, and ideological criticism.

<text>Mount Washington is a deeply eroded volcano in the Cascade Range of Oregon. It lies within Deschutes and Linn counties and is surrounded by the Mount Washington Wilderness area.

Like the rest of the Oregon Cascades, Mount Washington was produced by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the continental North American tectonic plate, forming during the late Pleistocene. Made mostly of mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) volcanic rock like subalkaline basalt and basaltic andesite, it has a volcanic plug occupying its summit cone and numerous dikes. It is surrounded by other volcanic features such as cinder cones and spatter cones. The volcano&#x27;s last eruptions took place from spatter cones about 1,350 years ago, generating basaltic andesite lava deposits.

Mount Washington has barren surroundings, which have seen little historical recreational use. A wagon road at McKenzie Pass was built in 1872, which was later paved during the 1930s. On August 26, 1923, the mountain was first ascended by six boys from the neighboring city of Bend. The surrounding area was designated the Mount Washington Wilderness by the federal government in 1964. The wilderness area is not heavily used, though it has a number of hiking trails. Wildlife is sparse in the region. Vegetation is mostly limited to pines and shrubs. Animal life includes deer, American black bear, cougar, various small animal species, and some fish species in the lakes.

== Geography ==

With an elevation of above sea level, Mount Washington is located in Deschutes and Linn counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. It lies north of McKenzie Pass, and some west of the city of Sisters. It is accessible by foot trails only; the western and southwestern sides of Washington intersect with the Skyline Trail about from the Big Lake trailhead near U.S. Route 20.

Despite being one of the smaller volcanic peaks in the Oregon Cascades, Mount Washington is the most prominent landmark between North Sister and Three Fingered Jack, with the Cache Mountain cinder cones to the northeast and Hayrick Butte and Hoodoo Butte to the northwest. The volcano forms a crest of steep, icy mountains with North Cinder Peak and Three Fingered Jack to the south of Mount Jefferson. The volcano has a pinnacle appearance resembling the spire-like shape of Mount Thielsen. According to Harris (2005), the volcano resembles Cleopatra&#x27;s Needle from certain angles and the Sugarloaf Mountain in Brazil from others. The proximal relief for the volcano is , while the draping relief is . The volcano has an overall volume of .

=== Physical geography ===

Elevations in the Mount Washington area range from to greater than . Most precipitation falls during the winter as snow, and summers are warm and dry. During the winter season, the Cascades are covered with thick snow. As a result, Oregon Route 242 over McKenzie Pass becomes impassable from fall through late spring, while the Santiam Highway and Oregon Route 126 are maintained and remain open.

Within the Mount Washington Wilderness, there are outwash plains and lateral, recessional, and terminal ground moraines. Many of these glacial deposits were created during the most recent glacial advance in the late Pleistocene, though there are Holocene glacial deposits as well. There was an ice sheet during the late Pleistocene between Mount Washington and Three Fingered Jack. The McKenzie River, fed by Clear Lake, runs south for about just west of Mount Washington before it turns west for another and meets the Willamette River near the city of Eugene.

== Wilderness==
The Mount Washington Wilderness covers an area of . First named a wild area by the United States Forest Service in 1975, it was designated as one of the original wilderness areas under the 1964 Wilderness Act. Located to the west of Bend, the Mount Washington plot is the smallest of three wilderness areas that encompass most of the High Cascades, a physiographic region located in the central part of Oregon; the two others are the Three Sisters Wilderness and Mount Jefferson Wilderness. Used mostly by hunters, hikers, and climbers, the Mount Washington area includes the Dee Wright Observatory, smaller volcanoes, and parts of the Pacific Crest Trail, which runs north–south through the wilderness for about . Other major features include Belknap Crater and 28 lakes. The wilderness area is jointly administered by authorities for the Willamette National Forest and Deschutes National Forest.

=== Mineral and geothermal potential ===

A mineral survey from 1980 through 1981 detected little potential for metallic mineral or fossil fuel resources in the Mount Washington Wilderness. The area contains large amounts of cinder – more than – but there are alternate sources in the region, which are sufficient to meet local demands. Likewise, there are no mines in the area, nor any documented history of mining claims; the closest mines are located to the west in the Blue River mining district. The volcanic vents throughout the Mount Washington Wilderness are underlain by Eocene to Pliocene volcanic rock layers, which do not contain hydrocarbons for fossil fuels. While there is relatively little potential for geothermal energy in the High Cascades, there are hot springs along the western edge of the mountain range. The Belknap Hot Spring lies to the southwest of the wilderness area, ejecting water at a rate of per minute with a temperature of .

== Ecology ==

Described by Wuerthner (2003) as a &quot;rocks and ice wilderness,&quot; much of the Mount Washington Wilderness consists of lava flows and rubble. However, it does include some forested areas, as well as 28 lakes in the northern and southwestern parts of the space. Vegetation in the area includes mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, and whitebark pine. Ponderosa pine occurs at the eastern base of the volcano, with Douglas fir on the western side. Vegetation is sparse on lava-covered surfaces. Mountain hemlock, however, also grows on lava flows, and there is an understory of beargrass, huckleberry, and rhododendron. Animal life includes large animals such as deer and elk, with the rare American black bear or cougar. Smaller animals like pikas, marmots, martens, snowshoe hares, and ground squirrels are also found in the area. Lakes in the wilderness sustain populations of brook trout, cutthroat trout, and rainbow trout, and frogs can be observed around some of them.

== Human history ==

The barrenness of Mount Washington&#x27;s surroundings means that it has seen little historical recreational use. A wagon road at McKenzie Pass was built in 1872, which was later paved during the 1930s and became Oregon Route 242. It received its name from the nearby McKenzie River, which in turn derived its name from Donald McKenzie, a fur trader who explored the area in 1812. On August 26, 1923, Mount Washington was climbed for the first time by six boys from Bend: Ervin McNeal, Phil Philbrook, Armin Furrer, Wilbur Watkins, Leo Harryman, and Ronald Sellars.

Before Mount Washington&#x27;s surroundings were designated a wilderness area in 1964, the Willamette National Forest administration had planned to open them to commercial timber production to address a shortage in Lane County, asserting that the land had little aesthetic or recreational merit. The area was established anyway, as Forest Service agents argued it would improve &quot;wilderness&quot;.

== Geology ==

Volcanism in the Oregon segment of the Cascade Range results from intra-range rifts and the subduction of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the North American tectonic plate. Mount Washington forms part of the High Cascades physiographic region in central Oregon, an arc of Pliocene to Quaternary lava flows, cinder cones, and fissure vents that trend from north to south, with occasional large stratovolcanoes. Near Mount Washington, the High Cascades form a lava field with high-alumina, diktytaxitic basalt erupted from cinder cones. These volcanoes have been eroded by glaciers and reduced to buttes in the Cascade arc, and much of the vents in the area were covered by Mount Washington. Some basalt lava flows occur on the edges of Mount Washington at the Cache Creek and Dry Creek canyons or as outcrops that form benches (long, relatively narrow strips of relatively level or gently inclined land bounded by distinctly steeper slopes above and below) about away from Washington from Patjens Lake to the McKenzie River.

Washington is part of the informal group of volcanoes known as Oregon&#x27;s Matterhorns, which includes Mount Thielsen, Three Fingered Jack, Mount Bailey, and Diamond Peak. The name originates from the spire-like appearance of the volcanoes&#x27; summits, which resembles the pinnacle of the Matterhorn in Switzerland. They all ceased eruptive activity at least 100,000 to 250,000 years ago, leading to their extensive dissection by glaciers over time. Mount Washington is also part of the Sisters Reach subsegment, which extends for and contains at least 466 volcanoes that were active during the Quaternary. Washington represents one of 30 mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) stratovolcanoes and shield volcanoes in the group, which include Pleistocene and Holocene eruptive centers. The volcano and its wilderness area sit on a lava platform with an altitude of , and they are bounded by faults to the east and west. Volcanic rocks contained within the wilderness area are either composed of older basalt or younger basaltic andesite, all of which were produced during the Quaternary, probably during the past 700,000 years. Pleistocene deposits show evidence of erosion by glaciers. Holocene deposits, dated between 3,000 and 1,500 years old, encompass about half of the wilderness area, and they also occur outside the wilderness area at its northwestern and southern borders.

Whether Mount Washington is a stratovolcano or shield volcano is debated within the literature. Wood and Kienle (1990) refer to it as a &quot;mafic shield volcano,&quot; and the Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution also considers it a shield volcano with a pyroclastic cone. Sherrod et al. (2004) classify Mount Washington as a &quot;steep-sided&quot; shield volcano. E. M. Taylor describes Mount Washington as a stratovolcano cone that reaches an elevation of above an older shield volcano, referring to it as &quot;a glacially-gutted Pleistocene stratovolcano.&quot; Hildreth (2007) likewise calls it a &quot;a glacially sculpted mafic stratocone [...] with a broad apron of mafic lavas.&quot; In his argument for classifying Mount Washington as a stratovolcano, Hildreth adds that it is made of composite materials with steep slopes and a high relief of . However, Hildreth acknowledges that there is morphological continuity from steep mafic cones into transitional, cone-shaped shield volcanoes like Olallie Butte.

Mount Washington has a diameter of about . It has a summit cone, a volcanic plug comprised by cinder, lava flows, and intrusive rock that covers Washington&#x27;s volcanic conduit. This plug is made of micronorite with a diameter of . There are dikes exposed throughout the summit cone, mostly oriented from north to south, with another dike swarm trending north from the central plug. The summit formed over a platform of basaltic andesite lavas from early eruptions at Mount Washington, made of thinner flows combined with pyroclastic rock.

The volcano has a mafic composition, with subalkaline basalt and basaltic andesite. Lava flows from Washington exhibit breccia with plagioclase and olivine, with palagonite tuff at the northeastern slope of the mountain that might indicate a past subglacial eruption during Washington&#x27;s cone-building phase.

Mount Washington has been eroded over time and is now very dissected, with its inner contents exposed and U-shaped canyons and cirques. In the late Pleistocene, large glaciers extending more than to the east and west carved cirques into the slopes of the volcano. The George Lake and Dry Creek cirques, which face north and northeast, respectively, show evidence of holding glaciers similar to those documented at Canyon Creek cirque on Three Fingered Jack with moraines. Wood and Kienle (1990) estimate that Mount Washington once extended to an elevation of , with an elevation of above the basalt lava field surrounding it.

=== Subfeatures ===

The Global Volcanism Program considers Cache Mountain, Little Cache Mountain, Hayrick Butte, and Hoodoo Butte subsidiary cones of Mount Washington. The Mount Washington Wilderness includes a number of cinder cones, typically with elevations between . Composed of gray to red cinder, they also have scoria and welded spatter. Major cinder cones in the wilderness include Belknap Crater, Twin Craters, Scott Mountain, and the Sand Mountain craters.
Eruptions from a chain of spatter cones mark the most recent activity at Mount Washington. About one mile in length, they trend northeast, with their mid-section parallel to depressions in the Cache Creek valley between Mount Washington and Blue Lake Crater. The northernmost vent of Mount Washington has a depth of and likely only ever erupted volcanic gas. The first group of four spatter cones lies to the south, with depths ranging from . Farther south, there are seven other vents, including three small craters separated from three larger vents to the south by a graben, as well as a central crater with a small crater on the northern side of its rim.

=== Mount Washington basaltic andesite ===

There are four major types of basalt and basaltic andesite in the central Cascades: early high-alumina olivine tholeiitic (HAOT) basalt, normal High Cascade HAOT basalt, North Sister basaltic andesites, and Mount Washington type basaltic andesites. Hughes (1990) argues that their differences could be the result of different magma sources or magma evolution in open systems. Mount Washington basaltic andesites are also considered one of the three distinct mafic rock types in the High Cascade platform, with North Sister basaltic andesites and normal basalts. The three groups all exhibit different major and trace element abundances. Mount Washington basaltic andesite is more common than North Sister basaltic andesite, with higher levels of incompatible elements and rare-earth elements. It also extends to the east and west of the major Cascade arc. Otherwise, the Mount Washington and North Sister basaltic andesites display lithologic similarities including a dearth of pyroxene phenocrysts and augite microphenocrysts, and both groups were probably near-primary melts. According to Hughes (1982), examples of Mount Washington basaltic andesites occur at Holocene deposits from Nash Crater, Four-in-One Cone, and Little Belknap Cone, as well as undated deposits at Todd Lake Volcano, Falls Creek, Broken Top, and the abutment of Tumalo Dam.

== Eruptive history ==

Mount Washington formed during the late Pleistocene epoch; the volcano itself is not older than a few hundred thousand years. Harris (2005) estimates that it has not erupted for more than 250,000 years, similar to Mount Thielsen; this date is supported by James, Manga, and Rose (1999). Paleomagnetic evidence suggests that the volcano and associated lava flows exhibit normal magnetic polarity. Its volcanic edifice was produced through the eruption of basaltic andesite and mafic volcanic ash, the latter being preserved as palagonite tuff along the northeastern and southwestern flanks of the summit cone.

Compared to larger stratovolcanoes in the Cascade volcanic arc, Mount Washington, like the rest of Oregon&#x27;s Matterhorns, had a relatively short eruptive life. Several spatter cones produced basaltic andesite on the lower northeastern side of the volcano, following a fissure that reached from Washington&#x27;s summit. There were no lava flows from this eruption, nor at an eruption at the nearby Blue Lake Crater, which produced volcanic material that displayed petrographic similarities to the Mount Washington splatter cone deposits. These include similar porphyritic textures with 10 to 15 percent plagioclase phenocrysts as well as similar alignments, suggesting that they erupted simultaneously. Sherrod et al. (2004) argue that the spatter cones and activity from Blue Lake Crater represent the most recent eruptions near the McKenzie Pass and Santiam Pass region.

It is still possible that new volcanic cones could be produced at the base of Mount Washington. However, according to Taylor, Causey, and MacLeod (1983), the volcano itself is unlikely to still be active.

== Recreation ==

While the area is not used as frequently as many other wilderness areas in the Oregon branch of the Cascade Range, it offers scenic lakes and trails. The Pacific Crest Trail passes over the western side of Mount Washington. Other trails include a loop around the Patjens Lakes, the Hand Lake trail, and the Benson Lake route. The U.S. National Geodetic Survey Data Sheet for Mount Washington notes that climbing the volcano is challenging and dangerous and thus is not recommended for inexperienced climbers or climbers without proper equipment.

== Notes ==
* [a] According to Hildreth&#x27;s definitions, proximal relief refers to the difference between the summit elevation and the highest exposure of old rocks under the main edifice, while draping relief marks the difference between the summit elevation and the edifice&#x27;s lowest distal lava flows (excluding pyroclastic and debris flows).

<doc id="467485" wikidata="Q1428368" url="?curid=467485" title="Kente cloth">
<text>Kente refers to a Ghanaian textile made of hand-woven strips of silk and cotton. Historically the fabric was worn in a toga-like fashion among the Asante, Akan and Ewe people. According to Asante oral tradition, it originated from Bonwire in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. In modern day Ghana, the wearing of kente cloth has become widespread to commemorate special occasions, and kente brands led by master weavers are in high demand.

Due to the popularity of kente cloth patterns, production of mass-produced prints with the kente patterns have become popular throughout West Africa, and by extension the whole of Africa. Globally, the print is used in the design of academic stoles in graduation ceremonies. 
== Etymology ==

Kente comes from the word &quot;kɛntɛn&quot;, which means &quot;basket&quot; in the Asante dialect of the Akan language, referencing its basket-like pattern. In Ghana, the Akan ethnic group also refers to kente as &quot;nwentoma&quot;, meaning &quot;woven cloth&quot;. Ashanti folklore includes a story where weavers invented kente by seeking to replicate the patterns of Anansi the spider.

== History ==
West African cultures have been weaving textiles for thousands of years. Archaeological evidence for the oldest form of handloom weaving in Southern Ghana has been discovered at Begho and Bono Manso. Spindle whorls and dye holes discovered in these sites have been dated to the 14th–18th centuries. At Wenchi, spindle whorls have been dated to the 16th–17th centuries.

Asante oral tradition give the origins of Kente to an individual from Bonwire who introduced a loom among the Asante from Bono Gyaman during the reign of Nana Oti Akenten in the 17th century. Another oral source states that it was developed indigenously by individuals from Bonwire during the reign of Osei Kofi Tutu I, who were inspired by the web designs of a spider. In the 18th century, Asantehene Opoku Ware I was documented by Danish agents Nog and L.F. Rømer, to have encouraged expansion in craft work. The Asantehene set up a factory during his reign to innovate weaving in the Ashanti Empire. This was the early stages of Kente production. The Danish agents described the operations of the factory as:
By the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Kente made out of silk was fully developed in Ashanti. In 1817, Thomas Edward Bowdich noted that weaving in Ashanti had progressed to an extent that cloths were made &quot;in all the varieties of colour, as well as pattern, [and] they were of an incredible size and weight.&quot; The word &quot;Kente&quot; might have been applied by the Fante traders to Ashanti fabrics.

Ewe version of Kente is made out of double-woven bands. 
According to oral tradition, Ewe weaving goes back to the 16th century when weavers were among the migrants who resettled in Ghana from Benin Republic and Western Nigeria. In the 18th century Keta became the centre of weaving among Ewe migrants who had settled in Southern Ghana. The earliest description of weaving among the southern ewe was from a report in 1718 by a Dutch West India Company official during his visit to Keta. By 1881, weaving was a prominent industry among the northern Ewe who had migrated north of the Volta River.

In December 2024, Kente cloth was recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible cultural heritage.

==Production==
Kente production can be classified by three versions: authentic kente cloth made by traditional weavers, kente print produced by brands such as Vlisco and Akosombo Textile Ltd, and mass-produced kente pattern typically produced in China for West Africans. Authentic kente cloth is the most expensive, while kente print varies in price depending on the production style.

For authentic kente, the towns of Bonwire, Sakora Wonoo, Ntonso, Safo and Adawomase are noted for kente weaving, and are located in the Ashanti region.

=== Tools Used in Kente Weaving ===
Weaving is done on a wooden loom in which multiple threads of dyed fabric are pressed together. Weavers are typically apprenticed under a master weaver or company for a number of years before producing their own patterns. Rolls of cloth are then imprinted with a brand to signify authenticity.

Gender has an influence on cloth production. Weaving kente is traditionally considered a male practice.

==Characteristics==
There exist hundreds of different kinds of kente patterns. Kente patterns vary in complexity, with each pattern having a name or message by the weaver. Ghanaians choose kente cloths as much for their names as their colors and patterns. Although the cloths are identified primarily by the patterns found in the lengthwise (warp) threads, there is often little correlation between appearance and name. Names are derived from several sources, including proverbs, historical events, important chiefs, queen mothers, and plants. The cloth symbolizes high value.&quot;Ahwepan&quot; refers to a simple design of warp stripes, created using plain weave and a single pair of heddles. The designs and motifs in kente cloth are traditionally abstract, but some weavers also include words, numbers and symbols in their work. Example messages include &quot;adweneasa&quot;, which translates as &#x27;I&#x27;ve exhausted my skills&#x27;, is a highly decorated type of kente with weft-based patterns woven into every available block of plain weave. Because of the intricate patterns, &quot;adweneasa&quot; cloth requires three heddles to weave.

==Symbolic meanings of the colors==

* Black: maturation, intensified spiritual energy, spirits of ancestors, passing rites, mourning, and funerals
* Blue: peacefulness, harmony, and love
* Green: vegetation, planting, harvesting, growth, spiritual renewal
* Gold: royalty, wealth, high status, glory, spiritual purity
* Grey: healing and cleansing rituals; associated with ash
* Maroon: the color of mother earth; associated with healing
* Pink: associated with the female essence of life; a mild, gentle aspect of red
* Purple: associated with feminine aspects of life; usually worn by women
* Red: political and spiritual moods; bloodshed; sacrificial rites and death.
* Silver: serenity, purity, joy; associated with the moon
* White: purification, sanctification rites and festive occasions
* Yellow: preciousness, royalty, wealth, fertility, beauty

==Controversy==

In June 2020, Democratic Party leaders kneeled in the United States Capitol Visitor Center for 8 minutes and 42 seconds in protest, causing controversy by wearing stoles made of kente cloth to show support against systemic racism. While it was said to be an act of unity with African-Americans, many, including Jade Bentil, a Ghanaian-Nigerian researcher, voiced objection tweeting &quot;My ancestors did not invent Kente cloth for them to be worn by publicity (obsessed) politicians as &#x27;activism&#x27; in 2020&quot;. On the other hand Congressional Black Caucus chair Karen Bass said, at a news conference for the introduction of the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, that the non-black lawmakers were showing solidarity, and April Reign, who is credited with initiating the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag, while not a fan of the symbolism, suggested that the legislation&#x27;s fate is more relevant than the event in the Capitol&#x27;s Emancipation Hall.

There is also a controversy with Louis Vuitton&#x27;s usage of a printed and monogrammed version of kente in their autumn-winter 2021 collection by American creative director Virgil Abloh, whose grandmother was Ghanaian. Additionally, questions of ownership of the woven craft, its image, and location of ateliers of production of kente. To this question of cultural appropriation, Abloh&#x27;s response to the press in 2020 was: &quot;Provenance is reality; ownership is a myth. In the same way, we cannot control our inspirations, we cannot trade-mark natural or cultural heritage as contemporary artistic territory.&quot; This coincided with the first appearance of this design of kente cloth printed on a dress worn by American poet Amanda Gorman for the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot;&#x27;s May 2021 issue.

<text>Belknap Crater is a shield volcano in the Cascade Range in the U.S. state of Oregon. Located in Linn County, it is associated with lava fields and numerous subfeatures including the Little Belknap and South Belknap volcanic cones. It lies north of McKenzie Pass and forms part of the Mount Washington Wilderness. Belknap is not forested and most of its lava flows are not vegetated, though there is some wildlife in the area around the volcano, as well as a number of tree molds formed by its eruptive activity.

Belknap was named for J. H. Belknap, whose father R. S. Belknap developed Belknap Springs. Early routes through the area extended near Belknap and its lava fields, and in the early 20th century, herds of sheep were moved to the two steptoes that lie among the Little Belknap lava flows to graze. The Oregon Skyline Trail, which runs to the west of Belknap&#x27;s lava flows, follows paths used by Native American populations, who harvested huckleberries in the area. Today, there are a number of trails that run near Belknap, including ones that extend to Little Belknap and Belknap Crater. Belknap can be seen by tourists at the Dee Wright Observatory, which was built in-part with lava blocks from Belknap Crater.

A precise determination for Belknap&#x27;s age has not been made, as its early history remains obscure. Belknap has likely been built up by eruptive activity over a long period of time. Belknap Crater has had four Holocene eruptive periods confirmed by geological evidence. In total, the Belknap shield and its multiple vents were formed in less than 1,500 years, its last eruptive episode finishing about 1,500 years ago. Belknap formed on the lower slopes of Mount Washington, a highly eroded volcano, and is one of the larger mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) volcanoes in the Sisters Reach.

Belknap consists of a shield volcano and pyroclastic cone and consists of basaltic and basaltic andesite lava with sub-alkaline composition, and it is characteristic of High Cascade volcanism. Well-preserved, its core is made of cinder materials; its eruptive deposits have well-preserved pressure ridges (tumuli) and levees. There are a number of subfeatures including the Inaccessible Cones, Little Belknap, South Belknap, and Twin Craters, as well as the Belknap hot springs. Postglacial, mafic eruptions are more common in the Sisters Reach — which includes Belknap — than anywhere in the Cascade volcanic arc. However, the Volcano Hazards Program of the United States Geological Survey considers it unlikely that Belknap will erupt again soon.

== Geography ==

Belknap Crater lies to the north of the Three Sisters, in the U.S. state of Oregon. Located within Linn County, it is part of the central Oregon segment of the Cascade Range. L. A. McArthur and L. L. McArthur (1984) described Belknap as &quot;one of the important features of the Cascade Range.&quot; It lies to the north of McKenzie Pass and can be seen from McKenzie Highway.

Hildreth (2007) lists Belknap Crater&#x27;s summit elevation at . McArthur and McArthur (1984) list its elevation at , while according to the U.S. National Geodetic Survey, Belknap reaches an elevation of , and has a &quot;bald&quot; appearance. The central Belknap shield volcano has a diameter of and a volume of , with a maximum thickness of . The shield has proximal and draping reliefs of , which are the &quot;difference between summit elevation and that of highest exposure of older rocks overlain by the edifice&quot; and the &quot;difference between summit elevation and that of lowest distal lavas of the edifice (not including distal pyroclastic or debris flows),&quot; respectively. According to Hildreth (2007), Belknap Crater is a broad, low-angled shield volcano compared to other mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) volcanic cones. Belknap&#x27;s summit cone rises about above the base shield volcano, and the volcano itself rises about above its surroundings.

Oregon Route 242, which follows the course of the McKenzie River, passes through the lava fields produced by Belknap Crater, the Yapoah cinder cone volcano, and a number of other volcanic vents. These fields consist of black, basaltic lava and encompass an area of .

== Ecology ==

Belknap forms part of the Mount Washington Wilderness, which encompasses of lava and plains. Lodgepole pine trees are common, and there are 28 lakes within the wilderness area. Belknap itself is not forested and its lava flows are generally not vegetated, though there were trees growing on its lava flow deposits in the 1960s according to Taylor (1965). He observed only sparse growth of trees on lava flows from Little Belknap in a report published in the 1980s, noting that soil from Belknap was about thick and made up of lapilli and volcanic ash, which came mostly from Belknap Crater. Along the trail to Little Belknap Crater, there is a tree island with lodgepole pine, mountain hemlock, and true fir. There are also ground squirrels running around on lava flows from Belknap. Along the Oregon Skyline Trail, which passes west of Belknap, there are black-tailed and mule deer as well as lakes stocked with Eastern brook trout

Along the western flows produced by Belknap, there are several dozen tree molds, which range from in diameter and in depth. Some fell into the lava, forming hemi-cylinder-shaped trenches up to in length. Taylor (1965) identified a system of radial roots that were charred from the lava under soil at one of the molds. The material underwent radiocarbon dating to determine an age of 360 ± 160 years A.D.

== Geology ==


The Cascade Range resulted from the subduction of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the North American tectonic plate, with the High Cascade subprovince in central Oregon forming about east of the margin of convergence. The High Cascade platform of the Cascade Volcanic Arc consists of overlapping layers of lava flows produced by shield volcanoes within the past 2 million years. The Cascade shields are steeper and smaller than Hawaiian shield volcanoes, often featuring cinder cones at their summit.

Belknap is the youngest shield volcano in the Cascade arc by far, with rugged, barren lava fields that contrast with the forested fields of older Cascade shields. It lies within the central Oregon segment of the Cascades near the Three Sisters area, which is marked by closely clustered volcanic centers that include, from south to north, Mount Bachelor, the Three Sisters, and Belknap.

Known as the Sisters Reach, the cluster abruptly broadens first to a width of then to as it approaches its southern end, running for about in length. There are at least 466 Quaternary volcanoes in the Sisters Reach, including several aligned segments of volcanic vents and rare eruptive units of rhyolite (uncommon elsewhere in the Cascade arc). Between the North Sister and Three Fingered Jack volcanoes, Holocene volcanism has been intense, with at least 125 volcanic centers becoming active between 4,000 and 1,300 years ago. Belknap was the last volcano to erupt in the Three Sisters area. Basaltic andesite dominates the eruptive material in the local mafic volcanoes, which range from early Pleistocene to Holocene age.

Belknap is one of the larger mafic volcanoes in the Sisters Reach, more than 30 of which run continuously along the segment. As with other mafic volcanic fields in and next to the Cascades, it does not exhibit a distinct pattern for compositional evolution over time like at the Hawaii hotspot. The area by Belknap and Mount Bachelor is marked by extensional tectonics, with a high density of mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) volcanic vents. There are clear trends among volcanic centers in the area including at Sand Mountain and Inaccessible Cone, suggesting underlying faults; according to Taylor (1965), Belknap&#x27;s alignment with the Spatter Cone Chain and Blue Lake Crater might similarly indicate underlying faults or fractures connecting the vents at depth, though there are some irregularities. One important distinction is that almost all vent patterns in the area except the supposed Belknap–Blue Lake alignment individually trend north–south, no matter the alignment of the aggregate trend.

Belknap formed on the lower slopes of Mount Washington, a highly eroded volcano; Mount Washington&#x27;s pinnacle lies about from Belknap. Dissolved magmatic carbon dioxide flux at Mount Washington and Belknap Crater was calculated by James et al. (1999) to be per year. Belknap consists of a shield volcano and pyroclastic cone, which form a late Holocene shield volcano complex. It is made up of basaltic and basaltic andesite lava, which is sub-alkaline. Mafic in composition, it is characteristic of High Cascade volcanism. In addition to its shield volcano vents, the Belknap complex also consists of lava flows and tephra deposits erupted from one central vent and several other flank vents. Its lava flows encompass about . It has a pyroclastic core. The more southern of the two craters on Belknap&#x27;s summit cone has a depth of and width of more than at its rim.

Belknap is one of three major lava fields in its area with Sand Mountain and Yapoah–Four-in-One–Collier. Of these, Belknap is the largest, encompassing Belknap Crater&#x27;s shield, Little Belknap, and South Belknap cone. Lava flows in the area have a black and glassy appearance with a vesicular texture. The basalt and basaltic andesite lava flows from Belknap include small plagioclase and olivine phenocrysts, which run for across, as well as glomerocrysts, which are sparse and run up to across. Some of the lava flows encased charcoal. Lava flows range from olivine basalt to basaltic andesite and generally show few signs of weathering or mineral alteration, with solid cores and outer surfaces with jagged volcanic blocks and flow breccia. The cores of lava deposits are inaccessible, except at lava tubes, lava gutters, road cuts, and quarries.

Belknap is well-preserved and serves as a good example of Holocene-era activity in the High Cascades. Its core consists of cinder, which is surrounded by a broad shield. It marks an intermediate scale between cinder cones that produced small lava flows such as Twin Craters or Yapoah and larger volcanoes like Mount Washington or Three Fingered Jack. Along with lava flows from the Sand Mountain Volcanic field and other young volcanic centers in the Santiam and McKenzie Pass area, many of the lavas produced by Belknap have crusts with slag or volcanic blocks, with a smaller number having surfaces with ropy, pāhoehoe appearances. The deposits consist of piles of basaltic andesite shards arranged in piles as a result of collapsed lava tubes and breakage of lava crusts and interior lava flows that continued moving while their exteriors cooled; Taylor (1965) wrote that Belknap &quot;is only a pile of cinders on the summit of a vast shield of recent lava.&quot; The estimated volume of cinders at Belknap Crater is .

Belknap&#x27;s volcanic deposits have well-preserved pressure ridges (tumuli) and levees on their surfaces, and they were emplaced between 7,000 and 1,300 years ago. Tephra erupted from Sand Mountain Volcanic Field and Belknap forms a thick blanket across Santiam Pass and near McKenzie Pass, with radiocarbon dating ages of 3,440 ± 250 to 1,600 years B.P. for deposits from source vents, making them younger than Mazama Ash deposits. Cinder cones near Inaccessible Cone have been nearly buried to completion by basalt and basaltic andesite erupted from Belknap. Belknap&#x27;s ash deposits are recognizable by their dark color among road cuts and at near the base of lava flow margins.

=== Notable vents and subfeatures ===


Little Belknap shield, formed about 3,000 years ago, sits to the right of a high scoria cone of the main Belknap Crater vent, with Mount Washington located to the right of both cones. It is about east of Belknap shield&#x27;s summit craters. Erupted on the flank of the much more extensive Belknap Crater, which also has its own secondary eruptive vents, Little Belknap lacks scoria cones, potentially because it was fed by magma that was degassed prior to its eruption.

Eruptions at Little Belknap were &quot;quiet&quot;, but voluminous, creating the separate shield, which is topped with cinders and lava blocks with collapsed lava tubes radiating outward. A western tube forms a confluence with a vertical conduit that has a diameter of about . Little Belknap&#x27;s lava flows extended to within of Windy Point to the east and McKenzie Pass to the southeast, forming deposits over ash from Belknap Crater and covered by lava flows from Yapoah Cone. Along the Skyline Trail, one of the lava flows from Little Belknap peeled back on itself as it cooled, creating overturned slabs of hardened lava with widths up to and lengths up to . The blocks are often parallel to the lava&#x27;s flow direction; Taylor (1965) called them &quot;lava curls&quot;.

There is a small lava cave system near the summit of Little Belknap, which has spatter material for a roof. The cave system is short with a number of lava tubes. At the bottom of the conduit lies another system of lava tubes, which served as a drain to create a lava tube system with two levels that are connected by this open conduit, which C. E. Skinner (1982) calls &quot;quite unusual.&quot; The open vertical conduit cave has a diameter of , dropping between the upper and lower cave systems. It has an ovular shape and a remelted lining with stalactites made from lava.

South Belknap is a small volcano to the south of Belknap, which was breached on its southwestern side by lava flows that also extended over Belknap Crater&#x27;s southern base. Early lava flows near South Belknap were covered by a later lava flow, which was produced by a vent located about northwestward. This lava flow also overlapped with the western part of Belknap Crater&#x27;s lava, and then it reached Lake Valley, where it formed the northern shore of the local Hand Lake. A deposit of alluvium abuts the margin of South Belknap&#x27;s lava deposits.

On top of Belknap Crater, there is a high cinder cone, which may be the surface extension of the inner pyroclastic core. Within it are three craters, all of different size, which align along a north–northwestern trend. The southern crater is large and produced most of the tephra that covers the surrounding area; the northernmost crater is smaller and erupted ash and a lava flow, which breached the rim of the crater. The Little Belknap volcano erupted lava flows that formed steptoes out of two hills by surrounding them with black, basalt. Its most recent eruptions filled its crater and created a mound of red rock with clinkers; there are a number of collapsed lava tubes diverging radially from the crater.

Besides the volcanic vents related to Belknap Crater, there are two volcanoes south of Belknap which were also recently active: Four-in-One Cone and Collier Cone. Another, unnamed cone at the northern end of Inaccessible Cone&#x27;s alignment, which rises to a height of , was breached on its western and southwestern sides by gray basalt lava, which is older than Sand Mountain Volcanic Field and Belknap. There may have been a large lava field in the glacier valley north of the Twin Craters cone, but any evidence is now buried under the Belknap shield. There is a glaciated steptoe (island) in the western part of the Belknap lava field. Deposits from Belknap buried older lava flows from the Sand Mountain Volcanic Field as well as a series of four cinder cones located about to the southwest of Mount Washington. There are also deposits from Belknap in the Lake Valley region between Belknap and both Sims Butte and Mount Mazama.

There are hot springs, known as the Belknap Hot Springs, on the northern bank of the McKenzie River. Located in Lane County, they were discovered by R. S. Belknap in November 1869. They lie to the southwest of the wilderness area, ejecting water at a rate of per minute with a temperature of . The hot springs are indicative of a fault that underlies the Cascade Volcanoes, onto which the east side dropped down and lava intrusions formed volcanic centers.

== Eruptive history ==

Eruptions at Belknap Crater built up the main shield volcano over repeated activity from vents surrounding a composite summit cone. The lava had a fluid character, leading to inundation of an area that encompassed more than . Rather than forming extensive streams, the lava settled into shorter channels that intersected, leaving complicated drainage patterns. The volcano sits on top of the thick and extensive lava deposits left behind. Belknap Crater has been the focal point for Holocene volcanism producing basaltic and basaltic andesitic lava in its vicinity, which was complex and sustained over a long period of time.

According to the Global Volcanism Program, Belknap Crater had four Holocene eruptive periods confirmed by geological evidence including corrected radiocarbon dating and magnetism; their durations are not known. The first took place in 5050 BCE, producing the Tamolitch lava flow. The next eruptive event, which took place in 1030 BCE ± 300 years, had a VEI of 0 and took place at Little Belknap. The subsequent eruption at South Belknap and Twin Craters occurred in 800 BCE ± 300 years and had a VEI of 2 (Strombolian/Vulcanian); it was followed by the most recent identified event at Belknap Crater in 480, which also had a VEI of 2. According to the Global Volcanism Program, these four eruptions took place during the Holocene:


A precise determination for Belknap&#x27;s age has not been made, as its early history remains obscure, though it is likely that Belknap has been built up by eruptive activity over a long period of time. Belknap&#x27;s oldest exposed lava deposits are located on the eastern flanks of the volcano, produced by vents that may have been buried by later activity. They coursed mostly to the northeast and split into two lobes on both sides of the Dugout Butte ridge, extending about from their source vent, along the eastern edges of the Deschutes National Forest.

Between 3,000 and 1,500 years ago during the late Holocene epoch, the Belknap shield volcano as well as the Belknap Crater cone and Little Belknap shield volcano erupted, generating lava flows that spread throughout the McKenzie Pass area. Belknap Crater&#x27;s lava flows were produced from its northeastern base and extended to the west, reaching the McKenzie River valley. These events represent one of the largest periods of recent volcanism in the Cascade Range, and were comparable in terms of effusion rates to the formation of Mount Bachelor.

The initial eruptions generated tephra, which covered an extensive area to the northeast and southeast, as well as basaltic lava flows that extended from the burgeoning shield volcano edifice to the east. Thin scoria deposits occur west of Belknap; on the eastern slopes, lava deposits are covered with black ash and fine cinders. There is also an ash blanketing an expansive area from Dry Creek to the north to Black Crater to the south, with ash deposits as far as eastward. These eruptions were produced from two, deep craters on top of Belknap&#x27;s cone, forming lapilli tuff on their eastern rim walls. There are also thick rocks in the walls of the more southern crater, as well as some lava that breached the southwestern rim, which has been obscured by spatter. The northern crater contains spindle volcanic bombs at its western rim, which reach up to in length. A broad pit formed at the northern base of Belknap&#x27;s cone, running for in length, and was likely blasted through a bocca. According to Taylor (1965), a strong prevailing wind moving east influenced the distribution of ash and cinders on Belknap&#x27;s rim.

Eruptions during a subsequent phase about 2,900 years ago built a smaller shield volcano, Little Belknap. According to Sherrod et al. (2004), lava from Little Belknap formed a tree mold in the southern part of the Sand Mountain volcanic field, which was dated to 2,883 ± 175 years Before Present (B.P.) via radiocarbon dating. Sherrod et al. (2004) also describe charcoal detected under a lava flow that coursed down Belknap Crater&#x27;s western flank, which yielded two radiocarbon dating ages: 1,590 ± 160 years B.P. and 1,400 ± 100 years B.P. These ages have overlap at the level of statistical certainty, indicating that they could have been erupted nearly simultaneously or as far apart as 800 years. Both flows came from the shield volcano&#x27;s summit vent. Early lava flows at Belknap were erupted from actively erupting volcanic vents before Little Belknap formed, as demonstrated by stratigraphy.

A third eruptive period constructed the bulk of the volcanic complex with basaltic andesite lava from Belknap Crater&#x27;s central vent about 1,500 years ago. This cone-building phase was also fed by eruptions about 1,700 years ago at a vent about to the south, South Belknap. According to Sherrod et al. (2004), South Belknap formed charred roots at a tree mold with a radiocarbon dating age of 2,635 ± 50 years B.P., the same site that Taylor used to determine an age of 1,775 ± 400 years B.P. Taylor also argues that the cone was breached about 1,800 years ago before it was surrounded by basaltic andesite lava flows from another vent about 1,500 years ago. Sherrod et al. argue that the older date (2,635 ± 50 years B.P.) is more accurate because the deposit contains concentrated amounts of the cosmogenic nuclide isotope 3He, which would require a longer surface exposure than Taylor&#x27;s calculation would allow, at least 2,000 years B.P.

A final eruptive phase produced lava flows that extended to the west into the McKenzie River valley, also coursing to the north and south. These lava deposits have ropy surfaces and feature squeeze-ups between broken platforms of crust. The lava that moved south crossed over more ancient lava from Twin Craters, while the lava that ran to the west covered lava and cinder cones within the Inaccessible Cone lineament. The west-moving lavas also moved over Sand Mountain lava flows (erupted from the southern group of vents and the southern vent of Sand Mountain itself), entering the McKenzie Canyon. The lava from this eruption significantly influenced the McKenzie River, creating the upstream swamp known as Beaver Marsh, with the remnants of these lava streams now forming permeable sediment talus for the McKenzie River, which disappears into them before re-emerging at Tamolitch Falls. Erosion has altered the area downstream from these falls to a lateral terrace on the wall of the McKenzie Canyon, above the river water level.

In total, the Belknap shield and its multiple vents were formed in less than 1,500 years, which was a comparable effusion rate to the Nash Crater scoria cone, the Sand Mountain Volcanic Field, and the Mount Bachelor chain. Eruption rates for Belknap were high, at per 1,000 years, similar to the buildup of rhyodacite before the climactic eruption at Mount Mazama. Within the last 15,000 years, Cascades volcanoes have erupted about of material excluding rear-arc volcanoes. Of this, about (21 percent) came from 63 distributed or peripheral cones, shields, or mafic and intermediate composition chains, with Belknap and Mount Bachelor contributing 71 percent of that material. Over the course of its eruptive history, Belknap erupted of material with several eruptive pulses.

=== Recent activity and potential hazards ===

Postglacial, mafic eruptions are more common in the Sisters Reach — which includes Belknap — than anywhere in the Cascade volcanic arc. A lava flow lies next to South Cinder Peak, the Nash Crater–Lost Lake cone cluster, Sand Mountain Volcanic Field, Inaccessible Cone chain, Blue Lake Crater, and a number of monogenetic scoria cones and chains. The McKenzie and Santiam Pass area saw more than a dozen distinct mafic eruptions between 4,500 and 1,100 years ago according to radiocarbon dating, which corresponded to a pulse of mafic eruptions in the late Holocene epoch. Other nearby mafic eruptive units occur at Sims Butte, Cayuse Crater, LeConte Crater, Mount Bachelor, the Egan Cone cluster, and the Katsuk-Talapus chain, which likely were all emplaced between 18,000 and 8,000 years ago. At the south of Sisters Reach, there is a postglacial, basalt lava flow that lies on the eastern flank of Sitkum Butte (a cone that is older than this lava flow). The recent eruptive activity at Belknap Crater means that it is one of the youngest mafic volcanoes in the Oregon Cascades.

There are about 6,500 people living within of Belknap Crater, with a population of about 362,000 within . However, most eruption hazards from basaltic volcanoes are generally restricted to within of the vent, with some exceptions. According to the Volcano Hazards Program of the United States Geological Survey&#x27;s Cascades Volcano Observatory, the threat potential from Belknap is &quot;Low/Very Low&quot;. It does not seem likely that Belknap Crater will erupt again, though eruptions with similar characteristics to its past eruptions might occur in the surrounding area, disrupting transportation on major highways in the vicinity including U.S. Route 20, Oregon Route 22, and Oregon Route 242. The eruption of tephra could pose a threat to surrounding communities, particularly within central Oregon to the east. High-volume lahars (mudflows or debris flows composed of a mix of pyroclastic material, rocky debris, and water) would travel far to the west. Moreover, low-volume lahars from eruptions would likely enter the McKenzie River valley, which is broad and fairly gently sloped, where they might move downstream through flood plains or small channels. Near Belknap Springs and McKenzie Bridge, deposits from the eruption could also block off water upstream, leading to downstream lahars and floods.

== Human history ==

Belknap was named for J. H. Belknap, who lived along the McKenzie River and was the son of R. S. Belknap, responsible for developing Belknap Springs. J. H. Belknap had an interest in the toll road constructed over McKenzie Pass during the early 1870s. The Belknap family came to the state of Oregon in 1847 with the Orem family, followed by G. Belknap and J. Belknap in 1848. The Belknap Springs in Lane County were found by R. S. Belknap in November 1869 and developed them, and he became the postmaster for the Salt Springs post office, which was established in October 1874. The name for the Salt Springs office changed to Belknaps Springs in June 1875, then Belknap Springs in 1891.

During the days of the American pioneer, the Santiam and McKenzie passes were the two major routes through the Deschutes Forest area, eventually transforming into highways for Oregon&#x27;s interior. The Willamette Pass to the south was used as a route by travelers as early as 1853, noting its difficult as the &quot;route was far from a road.&quot; Still, the road was heavily used in spite of its poor conditions, later becoming the Willamette Pass Highway, better known as Oregon Route 58. In 1862, the Scott brothers and colleagues formed the McKenzie Fork Wagon Road Company to create a better road passing over lava fields in the area, then later the McKenzie River Wagon Road Company, which had as its objective a road that crossed the Cascade Range near the Three Sisters volcano complex at the Deschutes River. A third group followed that aimed to forge a road across the Deschutes north of the Sisters. The original route pursued by the Scott brothers reached the Belknap hot springs.

In the early 20th century, herds of sheep were moved to the two steptoes that lie among the Little Belknap lava flows to graze. The Oregon Skyline Trail, which runs to the west of Belknap&#x27;s lava flows, follows paths used by Native American populations, who harvested huckleberries in the area.

== Recreation ==

The Dee Wright Observatory was built with lava blocks from the lava fields produced by Belknap, Yapoah cinder cone, and other volcanoes. It offers views of local volcanoes; Belknap lies to the north. Both Belknap Crater and Little Belknap Crater can be reached from spurs of the Pacific Crest Trail. The round trip from intersection of the Pacific Crest Trail and Oregon Route 242 to Little Belknap Crater is about and ranges in elevation from , with an easy to moderate difficulty level. The round trip to Belknap Crater is about from the trailhead and is more difficult owing to the steep climb to the summit on fine cinders.

The trail offers views of nearby Mount Washington, Black Crater, and the Three Sisters, as well as lava features. Trees and other forms of wildlife are rare along the trail. There is also a trail that extends to Belknap Crater, which runs about round trip, with an intermediate difficulty level. It can also be skied. The Oregon Skyline Trail, part of which runs for through the Deschutes National Forest, passes westward of the Belknap lava fields. It has been recognized as a major scenic route since 1920.

== Notes ==
* [a] This volume comes from Hildreth (2007); Taylor (1981) estimated its volume to be .
* [b] Taylor (1990) lists three principal eruptive episodes between about 3,000 and 1,500 years Before Present (BP). However, he still lists the four eruptions that the Cascades Volcano Observatory and Global Volcanism Program describe; he considers the two most recent eruptions to be part of the third major eruptive phase.
* [c] Sherrod et al. (2004) disagree with this date for the eruptive phase at South Belknap. As mentioned in the text, Sherrod et al. calculated a radiocarbon dating age of 2,635 ± 50 years B.P. for the same site that Taylor used to generate this estimated age, which is equivalent to 1,775 ± 400 years B.P.

<doc id="467490" wikidata="Q1291142" url="?curid=467490" title="Illness as Metaphor">
<text>Illness as Metaphor is a 1978 work of critical theory by Susan Sontag, in which she challenged the victim-blaming in the language that is often used to describe diseases and the people affected by them.

Teasing out the similarities between public perspectives on cancer (the paradigmatic disease of the 20th century before the appearance of AIDS), and tuberculosis (the symbolic illness of the 19th century), Sontag showed that both diseases were popularly associated with personal psychological traits. In particular, she said that the metaphors and terms used to describe both syndromes lead to an association between repressed passion and the physical disease itself. She wrote about the peculiar reversal that &quot;With the modern diseases (once TB, now cancer), the romantic idea that the disease expresses the character is invariably extended to assert that the character causes the disease—because it has not expressed itself. Passion moves inward, striking and blighting the deepest cellular recesses.&quot;

Sontag said that the clearest and most truthful way of thinking about diseases is without recourse to metaphor. She believed that wrapping disease in metaphors discouraged, silenced, and shamed patients. Some other writers have disagreed with her, saying that metaphors and other symbolic language help some affected people form meaning out of their experiences.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Illness as Metaphor&quot; served as a way for Susan Sontag to express her opinions on the use of metaphors in order to refer to illnesses, with her main focuses being tuberculosis and cancer. The book contrasts the viewpoints and metaphors associated with each disease. At one point, tuberculosis was seen as a creative disease, leading to healthy people wanting to look as if they were ill with the disease. However, lack of improvement from tuberculosis was usually seen as lack of passion in the individual. Tuberculosis was even seen as a sign of punishment by some religions, such as Christianity, leading the afflicted to believe that they deserved their ailment.

Sontag then made the comparison between the metaphors used to describe tuberculosis and cancer, with cancer being seen in the 1970s as a disease that afflicted people who lacked passion and sensuality, and those who repressed their feelings. Sontag wrote that multiple studies found a link between depression and cancer, which she argued was just a sign of the times and not a reason for the disease, since in previous times physicians found that cancer patients suffered from hyperactivity and hypersensitivity, which were signs of their times.

In the last chapter, Sontag argued that society&#x27;s disease metaphors cause patients to feel as if society were against them. Her final argument was that metaphors are not useful for patients, since metaphors make patients feel as if their illness was due to their feelings, rather than lack of effective treatment. The most effective way of thinking about illness would be to avoid metaphorical thinking, and to focus on only the physical components and treatment.

==Context==
Sontag wrote the treatise while being treated for breast cancer. She does not mention her personal experience with cancer in the work, but she addresses it in her related 1988 work, &quot;AIDS and Its Metaphors&quot;.

At the time that Sontag was writing, the fad in alternative cancer treatment was psychotherapy for the patient&#x27;s supposed &quot;cancer personality&quot;. According to these proponents, patients brought cancer upon themselves by having a resigned, repressed, inhibited personality (which contrasted with the tuberculosis patient, who was seen as passionate and creative). By undergoing the often blame-filled psychotherapy offered by some groups, such as the Simonton Center, the patient would overcome cancer by consciously choosing to give up the emotional benefits he or she created the cancer for, and be healed. Others have taken her idea further, showing not that there is a real &quot;cancer&quot; behind the metaphors, but that all we have is metaphor—even in science—to understand the behavior of a disease that remains mysterious.

==Publication==
The work was originally published as three long essays in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;. Some of the more inflammatory language was slightly toned down for republication. For example, what Sontag originally called the &quot;inimitable looniness&quot; of Wilhelm Reich&#x27;s language was softened to the &quot;inimitable coherence&quot;.

==Reception==
While one of Sontag&#x27;s widest read and most celebrated works, &quot;Illness as Metaphor&quot; received mixed reviews.
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called it &quot;a small, liberating book that could become the cancer patient&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense&quot;.&quot; 

The literary critic Denis Donoghue of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the book a negative review, describing it as &quot;a deeply personal book pretending for the sake of decency to be a thesis.&quot; He added: Despite this criticism, Donoghue also writes, &quot;If I wanted to see a fine discrimination made, with precisely the right degree of allowance for and against, I wouldn&#x27;t ask Miss Sontag to supply it. She would be bored by the request. But if I badly wanted to win, at nearly any cost, I would do anything to have Miss Sontag on my side.&quot; It is not clear, then, whether Donoghue is disdainful, admiring, or merely jealous of Sontag&#x27;s persuasive writing.

The literary critic and frequent Sontag detractor Camille Paglia described the book as &quot;clumsy and ponderous, like a graduate-school seminar paper.&quot;

<text>nthellworld was one of the first mainstream independent consumer lobby groups in the United Kingdom, whose main focal point was British ISP and Cable television company . nthellworld.com was created by Frank Whitestone, a university student, in November 2000 to create a community where people could discuss NTL issues, submit their own views of the company and publicise ntl&#x27;s failings.

Frank Whitestone later joined NTL and sold nthellworld.com to them in the process. ntl:home, as the consumer division of the NTL was known (now Virgin Media), closed nthellworld.com in November 2003. However, in June 2003 after foreseeing the closure of the original nthellworld site by NTL, Neil Crayne and Mick Ramsden, launched a new version of nthellworld using the domain nthellworld.co.uk, which was purchased from its original owner by Frank Whitestone as an insurance policy shortly after joining NTL. In February 2004, nthellworld was renamed Cable Forum in preparation for an NTL - Telewest merger and to shift the emphasis of nthellworld in a positive direction. In October 2005, merger plans were confirmed by ntl and Telewest boards. NTL (Now Virgin Media) provides an official community forum for its customers.

<text>Félix Rubén García Sarmiento (18 January 1867 – 6 February 1916), known as Rubén Darío ( , ), was a Nicaraguan poet who initiated the Spanish-language literary movement known as &quot;modernismo&quot; (modernism) that flourished at the end of the 19th century. Darío had a great and lasting influence on 20th-century Spanish-language literature and journalism. 

==Life==
His parents, Manuel García and Rosa Sarmiento were married on 26 April 1866, in León, Nicaragua, after obtaining the necessary ecclesiastic permissions since they were second degree cousins. However, Manuel&#x27;s conduct of allegedly engaging in excessive consumption of alcohol prompted Rosa to abandon her conjugal home and flee to the city of Metapa (modern Ciudad Darío) in Matagalpa where she gave birth to Félix Rubén. The couple made up and Rosa even gave birth to a second child, a daughter named Cándida Rosa, who died a few days after being born. The marriage deteriorated again to the point where Rosa left her husband and moved in with her aunt, Bernarda Sarmiento. After a brief period of time, Rosa Sarmiento established a relationship with another man and moved with him to San Marcos de Colón, in Choluteca, Honduras.

Rubén Darío was born in Metapa, Matagalpa, Nicaragua. Although, according to his baptism, Rubén&#x27;s true surname was García, his paternal family had been known by the surname Darío for many years. Rubén Darío explained it as follows in his autobiography: According to what some of the old people in that town of my childhood have referred to me, my great-grandfather had Darío as his nickname or first name. In this small town he was known by everyone as &quot;Don Darío&quot; and his entire family as the Daríos. It was in this way that his and all his family last name began to disappear to the point where my paternal great-grandmother already replaced it when she signed documents as Rita Darío; becoming patronymic and acquiring legal stand and validity since my father, who was a merchant, carried out all his businesses as Manuel Darío...

Darío spent his childhood in the city of León Nicaragua. He was brought up by his mother&#x27;s aunt and uncle, Félix and Bernarda, whom Darío considered, in his infancy, to be his real parents. (He reportedly, during his first years in school, signed his assignments as Félix Rubén Ramírez.) He rarely spoke with his mother, who lived in Honduras, or with his father, who he referred to as &quot;Uncle Manuel&quot;. Although little is known about his first years, it is documented that after the death of Félix Ramírez, in 1871, the family went through rough economic times and they considered sending young Rubén as a tailor&#x27;s apprentice. According to his biographer Edelberto Torres, he attended several schools in León before going on, during 1879 and 1880, to be educated by the Jesuits. 

A precocious reader (according to his own testimony, he learned to read when he was three years old), he soon began to write his first verses: a sonnet written by him in 1879 is conserved, and he published for the first time in a newspaper when he was thirteen years old. The elegy, &quot;Una lágrima&quot;, which was published in the daily &quot;El Termómetro&quot; (Rivas) on 26 July 1880. A little later he also collaborated in &quot;El Ensayo&quot;, a literary magazine in León, garnering attention as a &quot;child poet&quot;. In these initial verses, according to Teodosio Fernández, his predominating influences were Spanish poets contemporary to José Zorrilla, Ramón de Campoamor, Gaspar Núñez de Arce and Ventura de la Vega. His writings of this time display a liberalism hostile to the Roman Catholic Church, as documented in his essay, &quot;El jesuita&quot;, which was written in 1881. Regarding his political attitude, his most noteworthy influence was the Ecuadorian Juan Montalvo, whom he deliberately imitated in his first journalistic articles.

Around December 1881 he moved to the capital, Managua, at the request of some liberal politicians that had conceived the idea that, given his gift for poetry, he should be educated in Europe at the expense of the public treasury. However, the anti-clerical tone of his verses did not convince the president of congress, the conservative Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Alfaro, and it was resolved that he would study in the Nicaraguan city of Granada, but Rubén opted to stay in Managua, where he continued his journalistic endeavor collaborating with the newspapers &quot;El Ferrocarril&quot; and &quot;El Porvenir de Nicaragua&quot;. In the capital, he fell in love with an eleven-year-old girl, Rosario Emelina Murillo, whom he wanted to marry. He traveled to El Salvador in August 1882, at the petition of his friends who wanted to delay his marriage plans. It wasn’t uncommon for people of Darío’s age of 14 to marry.

===In El Salvador===
In El Salvador, Darío was introduced to the president of the republic, Rafael Zaldivar, by Joaquín Mendez, a poet who took him under his wing. There, he met the Salvadoran poet Francisco Gavidia, a connoisseur of French poetry. Under the auspices of Gavidia, Darío attempted, for the first time, to adapt the French Alexandrine metric into Castilian verse.

Although he enjoyed much fame and an intense social life in El Salvador, participating in celebrations such as the centenary of the birth of Simón Bolívar, things began to get worse. He encountered economic hardships and contracted smallpox. In October 1883, still convalescent, he returned to his native homeland. After his return, he briefly resided in León and then in Granada but he finally moved again to Managua, where he became an employee of the Biblioteca Nacional de Nicaragua (the National Library of Nicaragua) and he resumed his romance with Rosario Murillo. In May 1884 he was condemned for vagrancy and sentenced to eight days of public work, although he managed to evade the fulfillment of the sentence. During that time he continued experimenting with new poetic forms, and he even had a book ready for printing, which was going to be titled &quot;Epístolas y poemas&quot;. This second book also did not get published, it would have to wait until 1888 when it was finally published as &quot;Primeras notas&quot;. He tested his luck with theatre, and he released his first play, titled &quot;Cada oveja...&quot;, which had some success, but no copy remains. He found life in Managua unsatisfactory, and prompted by the advice of some friends, opted to embark for Chile on 5 June 1886. 

===In Chile===
After making a name for himself with love poems and stories, Darío left Nicaragua for Chile in 1886, and disembarked in Valparaiso on 23 June 1886. In Chile he stayed with Eduardo Poirier and a poet by the name of Eduardo de la Barra, together they co-authored a sentimental novel titled &quot;Emelina&quot;, with which they entered in a literary contest (although they did not win). It was because of his friendship with Poirier that Darío was able to obtain a job in the newspaper &quot;La Época&quot;, in Santiago in July 1886.

During his stay in Chile, Darío had to endure continuous humiliation from the Chilean aristocracy that scorned him for his lack of refinement and for the color of his skin. Nonetheless, he managed to forge a few friendships, like the one with the son of the then president, the poet Pedro Balmaceda Toro. Soon after he published his first piece, &quot;Abrojos&quot;, in March 1887. He lived in Valparaiso for several months until September 1887 where he participated in several literary contests. In the month of July 1888, &quot;Azul&quot;, the key literary work of the modernist revolution that had just begun, was published in Valparaiso. 

&quot;Azul...&quot; is a compilation of a series of poems and textual prose that had already been published in the Chilean media between December 1886 and June 1888. The book was not an immediate success, but was well received by the influential Spanish novelist and literary critic Juan Valera, who published in the Madrid newspaper &quot;El Imparcial&quot;, in October 1888, two letters addressed to Darío, in which, although reproaching him for the excessive French influence in his writings (Valera&#x27;s used the expression &quot;galicismo mental&quot; or &#x27;mental Gallicism&#x27;), he recognized in Darío &quot;[a] un prosista y un poeta de talento&quot; (&quot;a prose writer and poet of talent&quot;).

===Journey in Central America===
The newly attained fame allowed Darío to obtain the position of newspaper correspondent for &quot;La Nación&quot; of Buenos Aires, which was at the time the most heavily circulated periodical in Hispanic America. A little after sending his first article to &quot;La Nacion&quot;, he set off on a trip back to Nicaragua. During a brief stop in Lima he met the writer Ricardo Palma. He arrived at the port in Corinto on 7 March 1889. In León, he was received as a guest of honor, but his stay in Nicaragua was brief, and he moved to San Salvador, where he was named director of the periodical &quot;La Unión&quot; which was in favor of creating a unified Central American state. In San Salvador, he was married by law to Rafaela Contreras, daughter of a famous Honduran orator, Álvaro Contreras, on 21 June 1890. One day after the wedding there was a coup d&#x27;état against president (and general) Menéndez. The coup was mainly engineered by general Carlos Ezeta, who had been a guest at Darío&#x27;s wedding, which ended with the death of his wife, which led him to remarry for a brief period, only for him to separate very shortly thereafter. 

He decided to leave El Salvador despite job offers from the new president. He moved to Guatemala at the end of June, while his bride remained in El Salvador. Guatemalan president Manuel Lisandro Barillas was making preparations for a war against El Salvador. Darío published, in the Guatemalan newspaper &quot;El Imparcial&quot;, an article titled &quot;Historia Negra&quot; in which he denounced Ezeta&#x27;s betrayal of Menéndez. In December 1890 he was tasked with directing a newly created newspaper, &quot;El Correo de la Tarde&quot;. That same year the second edition of his successful book &quot;Azul...&quot;, substantially expanded, and using Valera&#x27;s letters, which catapulted him to literary fame, as prologue (it is now customary that these letters appear in every edition of this book), was published in Guatemala. In January 1891 his wife reunited with him in Guatemala and they were married by the church on 11 February 1891. Three months later, the periodical which Darío was editing, &quot;El Correo de la Tarde&quot;, ceased receiving government subsidies, which forced it to close. He moved to Costa Rica and installed himself in the country&#x27;s capital, San Jose, in August 1891. While in Costa Rica, he was haunted by debt despite being employed and was barely able to support his family. His first son, Rubén Darío Contreras, was born on 12 November 1891. 

===Travels===
In 1892, he left his family in Costa Rica, and traveled to Guatemala and Nicaragua, in search for better economic prospects. Eventually, the Nicaraguan government named him a member of the Nicaraguan delegation to Madrid, where events were going to take place to commemorate the fourth centennial of the discovery of America. During the trip to Spain, Darío made a stop in Havana, where he met Julián del Casal and other artists, such as Aniceto Valdivia and Raoul Cay. On 14 August 1892, he disembarked in Santander, where he continued his journey to Madrid via train. Among those with whom he interacted frequently were poets Gaspar Núñez de Arce, José Zorrilla and Salvador Rueda; novelists Juan Valera and Emilia Pardo Bazán; erudite Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo; and several distinguished politicians such as Emilio Castelar and Antonio Cánovas del Castillo. In November, he returned to Nicaragua, where he received a telegram from San Salvador notifying him of his wife&#x27;s illness; she died on 23 January 1893. 

At the onset of 1893, Ruben remained in Managua, where he renewed his affairs with Rosario Murillo, whose family forced Darío to marry her.

===In Argentina===

Darío was well received by the intellectual media of Buenos Aires. He collaborated with several newspapers: in addition to &quot;La Nación&quot;, to which he was already a correspondent, he published articles in &quot;La Prensa&quot;, &quot;La Tribuna&quot; and &quot;El Tiempo&quot;, to name a few. His position as the Colombian consul was merely honorific, since, as Darío has stated in his autobiography: &quot;no había casi colombianos en Buenos Aires y no existían transacciones ni cambios comerciales entre Colombia y la República Argentina.&quot; In the Argentinian capital he led a bohemian life-style and his abuse of alcohol led to the need for medical care in several occasions. Among the personalities with whom he dealt were the politician Bartolomé Mitre, the Mexican poet Federico Gamboa, the Bolivian poet Ricardo Jaimes Freyre and the Argentinian poets Rafael Obligado and Leopoldo Lugones.

His mother, Rosa Sarmiento, died on 3 May 1895. In October 1895, the Colombian government abolished its consulate in Buenos Aires depriving Darío of an important source of income. As a remedy, he obtained a job as Carlos Carlés&#x27;s secretary, who was the general director of the institution handling mail and telegrams in Argentina. In 1896, in Buenos Aires, Darío published two of his most crucial books: &quot;Los raros&quot;, a collection of articles about the writers that most interested him, and second, &quot;Prosas profanas y otros poemas&quot;, the book that established the most definite consecration of Spanish literary modernism. However popular it became, though, his work was not initially well received. His petitions to the Nicaraguan government for a diplomatic position went unattended; however, the poet discovered an opportunity to travel to Europe when he learned that &quot;La Nación&quot; needed a Correspondent in Spain to inform about the situation in the European country after Spain&#x27;s disaster of 1898. It is from the United States military intervention in Cuba that Rubén Darío coined, two years before José Enrique Rodó, the metaphorical opposition between Ariel (a personification of Latin America) and Calibán (a monster which represents the United States of America.) On 3 December 1898, Darío decamped to Europe, arriving in Barcelona three weeks later.

===Between Paris and Spain===

Darío arrived in Spain committed to sending four chronicles per month to &quot;La Nación&quot; about the prevalent mood in the Spanish nation after the defeat it suffered to the United States of America, and the loss of its colonial possessions; Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam. These chronicles would end up being compiled in a book that was published in 1901, titled &quot;España Contemporánea. Crónicas y retratos literarios&quot;. In the writings, he expresses his profound sympathy towards Spain, and his confidence in Spain&#x27;s revival, despite the state of despair he observed. In Spain, Darío won the admiration of a group of young poets who defended Modernism (a literary movement that was not absolutely accepted by the most established writers, especially those belonging to the Real Academia Española.) Among these young modernists there were a few writers that would later have important roles in Spanish literature such as Juan Ramón Jiménez, Ramón María del Valle-Inclán and Jacinto Benavente, and some that were prevalent in their time, like Francisco Villaespesa, Mariano Miguel de Val, director of the magazine Ateneo, and Emilio Carrere. 

In 1899, Rubén Darío, who was still legally married to Rosario Murillo, met Francisca Sánchez del Pozo in the Casa de Campo of Madrid. Francisca was from Navalsauz in the province of Ávila and would be his companion through the last years of his life. In April 1900, Darío visited Paris for a second time, commissioned by &quot;La Nación&quot; to cover the Exposition Universelle that took place that year in the French capital city. His chronicles about this topic would later be compiled in the book &quot;Peregrinaciones&quot;.

During the first years of the 20th century, Darío lived in Paris, where in 1901 published the second edition of &quot;Prosas profanas&quot;. That same year Francisca and Rubén had a daughter. After giving birth she traveled to Paris to reunite with him, leaving the baby girl in the care of her grandparents. The girl died of smallpox during this period, without her father ever meeting her. In March 1903 he was appointed as consul by Nicaragua. His second child by Francisca was born in April 1903, but also died at a very young age. During those years, Darío traveled through Europe, visiting, among other countries, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, and Italy. In 1905, he went to Spain as a member of a committee named by the Nicaraguan government whose task was to resolve a territorial dispute with Honduras. That year he published, in Madrid, the third of his most important poetry books, &quot;Cantos de vida y esperanza, los cisnes y otros poemas&quot;, edited by Juan Ramón Jiménez. Some of his most memorable poems came to light in 1905, like &quot;Salutación del optimista&quot; and &quot;A Roosevelt&quot;, in which he extols Hispanic traits in the face of the threat of United States imperialism. The second poem (below) was directed at then president of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt:

In 1906 he participated as secretary of the Nicaraguan delegation to the Third Pan-American Conference held in Rio de Janeiro where he was inspired to write his poem &quot;Salutación del águila&quot;, which offers a view of the United States very different from that offered in prior poems:

This poem was criticized by several writers who did not understand Ruben&#x27;s sudden change of opinion with respect to the United States&#x27; influence in Latin America. In Rio de Janeiro, the poet was involved in an obscure romance with an aristocrat, believed to be the daughter of the Russian ambassador in Brazil. It seems that he then conceived the idea of divorcing Rosario Murillo, from whom he had been separated for years. On his way back to Europe, he made a brief stop in Buenos Aires. In Paris, he reunited with Francisca and together they spent the winter of 1907 on the island of Mallorca, which he later frequented the company of Gabriel Alomar, a futurist poet, and painter Santiago Rusiñol. He began writing a novel, &quot;La Isla de Oro&quot;, which he never finished, although some of its chapters were published in &quot;La Nación&quot;. His tranquility was interrupted by the arrival of his wife, Rosario Murillo, in Paris. She would not grant him a divorce unless she was guaranteed sufficient compensation, which Darío felt was disproportionate. By March 1907, when he was leaving for Paris, his alcoholism was very advanced and he fell gravely ill. On recuperating, he returned to Paris, but he was unable to reach an agreement with his wife, so he decided to return to Nicaragua to present his case in court. 

===Ambassador in Madrid===
After two brief stops in New York and Panama, Darío arrived in Nicaragua where he was given a warm welcome. Regardless of the tributes offered to him, he failed to obtain a divorce. In addition, he was not paid what was owed to him from his position as consul; this left him unable to return to Paris. After a few months he managed to be named resident minister in Madrid for the Nicaraguan government of José Santos Zelaya. He had economic problems since his limited budget barely allowed him to meet all of his delegation&#x27;s expenses, and he had much economic difficulty while he was Nicaraguan ambassador. He managed to get by, partly with his salary from &quot;La Nación&quot; and partly with the help of his friend and director of the magazine &quot;Ateneo&quot;, Mariano Miguel de Val, who, while the economic situation was at its toughest, offered himself as secretary to the Nicaraguan delegation at no charge and offered his house, number 27 Serrano street, to serve as the diplomatic quarters of the Nicaraguan delegation. When Zelaya was overthrown, Darío was forced to resign his diplomatic post on 25 February 1909. He remained loyal to Zelaya, whom he had heavily praised in his book &quot;Viaje a Nicaragua e Intermezzo tropical&quot;, and with whom he had collaborated in the writing of &quot;Estados Unidos y la revolución de Nicaragua&quot;. In that work the United States and the Guatemalan dictator Manuel Estrada Cabrera were accused of planning the overthrow of the Zelaya government. During his time as ambassador, there was a rift between Darío and his former friend Alejandro Sawa, whose requests for economic assistance went unheard by Darío. The correspondence between them gives room to interpret that Sawa was the real author of several of the articles that Darío had published in &quot;La Nación&quot;.

===Last years===

In 1910, Darío traveled to Mexico as a member of a Nicaraguan delegation to commemorate a century of Mexican independence. However, the Nicaraguan government changed while Darío was abroad, and Mexican dictator Porfirio Díaz refused to receive the writer, an attitude that was probably influenced by United States diplomacy. Darío, however, was well received by the people of Mexico, who supported Darío and not the government.

In his autobiography, Darío relates those protests with the Mexican Revolution, which was about to occur:For the first time in thirty three years of absolute control, the house of the old Caesarean emperor had been stoned. One could say that that was the first thunder of the revolution that brought the dethronement. In light of the slight by the Mexican government, Darío left for La Habana, where, under the effects of alcohol, he attempted to commit suicide, perhaps triggered by the way he had been scorned. In November 1910 he returned to Paris, where he continued being a correspondent for &quot;La Nación&quot; and where he took a position for the Mexican Ministry of Public Instruction (Ministerio de Instrucción Pública) which may have been given to him as a compensation for the public humiliation inflicted upon him.
In 1912 he accepted an offer from the Uruguayan businessmen Rubén and Alfredo Guido to direct the magazines &quot;Mundial&quot; and &quot;Elegancias&quot;. To promote said publications, he went on tour in Latin America visiting, among other cities, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Montevideo and Buenos Aires. It was also around this time that the poet wrote his autobiography, which was published in the magazine &quot;Caras y caretas&quot; under the title of &quot;La vida de Rubén Darío escrita por él mismo&quot;; and the work &quot;Historia de mis libros&quot; which is very important when learning about his literary evolution. 

After ending his journey due to the end of his contract with the Guido brothers, he returned to Paris and in 1913, invited by Joan Sureda, he traveled to Mallorca and found quarters at the Carthusian monastery of Valldemosa, where many decades into the past figures such as Chopin and George Sand had resided. It was in this island where Ruben began writing the novel &quot;El oro de Mallorca&quot;, which was a fictionalization of his autobiography. The deterioration of his mental health became accentuated, however, due to his alcoholism. In December he headed back to Barcelona, where he lodged at General Zelaya&#x27;s house. Zelaya had taken Darío under his wing when he was president of Nicaragua. In January 1914 he returned to Paris, where he entered a lengthy legal battle with the Guido brothers, who still owed him a large sum of money for the work he had done for them. In May he moved to Barcelona, where he published his last important work of poetry, &quot;Canto a la Argentina y otros poemas&quot;, which includes the laudatory poem he had written to Argentina, which had been made to order for &quot;La Nación&quot;. 

==Death==

Darío died on 6 February 1916, aged 49, in León. The funeral lasted several days, and he was interred in the city&#x27;s cathedral on 13 February 1973 at the base of the statue of Saint Paul near the chancel under a lion made of marble by the sculptor Jorge Navas Cordonero.

==Poetry==
===Range===
Darío wrote in thirty seven different metrical lines and 136 different stanza forms.

===Influences===

French poetry was a determinant influence in Darío&#x27;s formation as a poet. In the first place, the romantics, particularly Victor Hugo. Later on, and in a decisive fashion, Darío was influenced by the parnassians: Théophile Gautier, Catulle Mendès, and José María de Heredia. Another decisive influence was the writer of prose and poetry and national hero of Cuba, Jose Martí. The final defining element of Darianian aesthetic is his admiration towards the symbolists, especially Paul Verlaine. Recapitulating his own poetic trajectory in the initial poem of &quot;Cantos de vida y esperanza&quot; (1905) Darío himself synthesized his main influences when he affirms that he was &quot;strong with Hugo and ambiguous with Verlaine&quot; (&quot;con Hugo fuerte y con Verlaine ambiguo&quot;.)

In the section &quot;Palabras Liminares&quot; of &quot;Prosas Profanas&quot; (1896) he had already written a paragraph that reveals the importance of French culture in the development of his literary work:The old Spaniard with a white beard points towards a series of illustrious portraits: &quot;This one—he says—is the great Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, one-handed genius; this one is Lope de Vega, this one is Garcilaso, this one Quintana.&quot; I ask him for the noble man Gracián, for Teresa of Ávila, for the brave Góngora and the strongest of all, Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas. Then I say: &quot;Shakespeare! Dante! Hugo...! (and in my head: Verlaine...!)&quot; Then, when saying goodbye: &quot;-Old man, it is important to say: my wife is from my land; my mistress is from Paris.&quot;

&quot;Los raros&quot; is an illustrative volume regarding literary tastes, which he published on the same year as &quot;Prosas profanas&quot;, and dedicated to briefly glossing some of the writers and intellectuals towards whom he felt profound admiration. Amongst those in the book we find Edgar Allan Poe, Villiers de l&#x27;Isle Adam, Léon Bloy, Paul Verlaine, Lautréamont, Eugénio de Castro and José Martí (the latter being the only one mentioned who wrote their literary work in Spanish.) The predominance of French culture is more than evident. Darío wrote: &quot;Modernism is nothing more than Spanish verse and prose passed through the fine sieve of the good French verse and the good French prose.&quot; Setting aside his initial stage, before &quot;Azul...&quot;, in which his poetry owes a great deal to the great names of 19th-century Spanish poetry, such as Núñez de Arce and Campoamor, Darío was a great admirer of Bécquer. Spanish themes are well represented in his work, already in &quot;Prosas profanas&quot; and, specially, after his second trip to Spain, in 1899. Conscious of contemporaneous Spanish decadence in politics and the arts (a preoccupation he shared with the so-called Generation of &#x27;98), he frequently was inspired by characters and elements of the past. Regarding authors in other languages, it is worth mentioning that he felt a profound admiration towards three writers from the United States: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman. 

==Assessment==
Roberto González Echevarría considers him the beginning of the modern era in Spanish language poetry: &quot;In Spanish, there is poetry before and after Rubén Darío. ... the first major poet in the language since the 17th century ... He ushered Spanish-language poetry into the modern era by incorporating the aesthetic ideals and modern anxieties of Parnassiens and Symbolism, as Garcilaso had infused Castilian verse with Italianate forms and spirit in the 16th century, transforming it forever. Darío led one of the most profound poetic revolutions in Spanish according to Latin American poets Octavio Paz, who wrote a prologue to a translation of Darío&#x27;s selected poems.

===Evolution===
The evolution of Darío&#x27;s poetry is marked by the publication of the books in which scholars have recognized his fundamental works: &quot;Azul...&quot; (1888), &quot;Prosas profanas y otros poemas&quot; (1896) y &quot;Cantos de vida y esperanza&quot; (1905). Before &quot;Azul...&quot; Darío wrote three books and a great number of loose poems which make up what is known as his &quot;literary prehistory&quot; (&quot;prehistoria literaria&quot;.) The books are &quot;Epístolas y poemas&quot; (written in 1885, but published until 1888, under the title &quot;Primeras notas&quot;), &quot;Rimas&quot; (1887) and &quot;Abrojos&quot; (1887). In the first of these works his readings of Spanish classics is patent, as is the stamp of Victor Hugo. The metric is classic and the tone is predominantly romantic.

In &quot;Abrojos&quot;, published in Chile, the most acknowledged influence is that from the Spaniard Ramón de Campoamor. &quot;Rimas&quot;, also published in Chile in the same year, was written for a contest to imitate the Bécquer&#x27;s &quot;Rimas&quot;, hence, it is not strange that the intimate tone adopted in this book is very similar to the one present in the writings of the Sevillian poet. It consists of only fourteen poems, of amorous tone, whose expressive means are characteristically bécquerian.

&quot;Azul...&quot; (1888) has as many tales in prose as poems, which caught the critics&#x27; attention through their metric variety. It presents us some of the preoccupations characteristic of Darío, such as his expression of dissatisfaction towards the bourgeoisie. A new edition of the text was published in 1890, this one was augmented with several new texts, amongst which were sonnets in Alexandrine verses. Modernism&#x27;s stage of plenitude and of the Darian poetry is marked by the book &quot;Prosas profanas y otros poemas&quot;, a collection of poems in which the presence of the erotic is more important, and which contains some esoteric themes (such as in the poem &quot;Coloquio de los centauros&quot;). In this book, we can also find Darío&#x27;s own eclectic imagery. In 1905, he published &quot;Cantos de vida y esperanza&quot;, which announces a more intimate and reflexive trend in his works, without renouncing to the themes that have become linked to the identity of Modernism. At the same time, civic poetry appears in his work, with poems like &quot;A Roosevelt&quot;, a trend that would be accentuated in &quot;El canto errante&quot; (1907) and in &quot;Canto a la Argentina y otros poemas&quot; (1914).

<text>The TC Energy Center is a highrise that represents one of the first significant examples of postmodern architecture construction in downtown Houston, Texas. The building has been formerly known as the [[First RepublicBank Corporation|RepublicBank Center]], the [[North Carolina National Bank|NCNB Center]], the [[NationsBank|NationsBank Center]], and the [[Bank of America|Bank of America Center]]. The building was completed in October 1983 and designed by award-winning architect Johnson/Burgee Architects, and is reminiscent of the Dutch Gothic architecture of canal houses in The Netherlands. It has three segmented tower setbacks, each with &quot;a steeply pitched gabled roofline that is topped off with spires&quot;. The tower was developed by Hines Interests and is owned by a joint venture of M-M Properties and an affiliate of the General Electric Pension Trust.

The banking center is housed in a separate building, due to construction problems, and has a three-story lobby. There are 32 passenger elevators each finished with wood panels that include Birdseye Maple, Macassar Ebony, Italian Willow, Tamo, and Kevazingo. The building contains an art gallery in the lobby and plans to host curated exhibitions.

The building was renamed for TC Energy in 2019, which serves as the company&#x27;s US headquarters, and is the largest tenant in the building.

==Background==
At 56 stories the TC Energy Center is the 101st tallest building in the United States and is the eighth tallest building in Texas.

The northeast corner of the structure houses a building within a building. On the site is the main Western Union building and when relocation of the telegraph cables proved unfeasible, a new structure was built over the site and the existing structure was incorporated into the new building intact. The stone used for the exterior is red Swedish granite, giving the building a &quot;dark pink&quot; appearance.

==Accident==
On June 9, 2001, the building was the site of an accident that took place during Tropical Storm Allison. Building security warned individuals that the below-grade parking levels were in danger of flooding and instructed persons working late in the building to move vehicles to upper levels of the garage. Kristie Tautenhahn, an employee of the law firm Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt, went to move her vehicle parked on sub-level 3 at 10:30 UTC (05:30 CDT) which by that time was completely submerged. She drowned in an elevator car trying to escape water that had erupted out when a cinderblock wall that separated the parking garage from the tunnel system broke.

<doc id="467523" wikidata="Q312814" url="?curid=467523" title="Frank Marshall (chess player)">
<text>Frank James Marshall (August 10, 1877 – November 9, 1944) was the U.S. Chess Champion from 1909 to 1936, and one of the world&#x27;s strongest chess players in the early part of the 20th century.

==Chess career==
Marshall was born in New York City, and lived in Montreal, Canada, from age 8 to 19. He began playing chess at the age of 10, and by 1890 (aged 13) was one of the leading players in Montreal.
He won the 1904 Cambridge Springs International Chess Congress (scoring 13/15, ahead of World Champion Emanuel Lasker) and the U.S. Congress in 1904, but did not get the national title because the U.S. champion at that time, Harry Nelson Pillsbury, did not compete. In 1906 Pillsbury died and Marshall again refused the championship title until he won it in competition in 1909.

In 1907 he played a match against World Champion Emanuel Lasker for the title and lost eight games, winning none and drawing seven. They played their match in New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Chicago, and Memphis from January 26 to April 8, 1907.

In 1909, he agreed to play a match with then young Cuban chess player José Capablanca and, to most people&#x27;s surprise, lost eight games, drew fourteen, and won only one. After this defeat, Marshall did not resent Capablanca; instead, he realized the young man had immense talent and deserved recognition. The American champion worked hard to ensure Capablanca had the chance to play at the highest levels of competition. Marshall insisted that Capablanca be permitted to enter the San Sebastián tournament in 1911, an exclusive championship promising to be one of the strongest yet in history. Despite much protest at his inclusion, Capablanca won the tournament.

Marshall finished fifth at the St. Petersburg tournament in 1914, behind World Champion Lasker, future World Champions Capablanca and Alekhine, and former World Championship challenger Tarrasch, but ahead of the players who did not qualify for the final: Ossip Bernstein, Rubinstein, Nimzowitsch, Blackburne, Janowski, and Gunsberg. According to Marshall&#x27;s 1942 autobiography, which was reportedly ghostwritten by Fred Reinfeld, Tsar Nicholas II conferred the title of &quot;Grandmaster&quot; on Marshall and the other four finalists. Chess historian Edward Winter has questioned this, stating that the earliest known sources that support this story are Marshall&#x27;s autobiography and an article by Robert Lewis Taylor in the June 15, 1940, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

In 1915, Marshall opened the Marshall Chess Club in New York City. In 1925 Marshall appeared in the short Soviet film &quot;Chess Fever&quot; in a cameo appearance along with Capablanca.

In 1920, he won the American Chess Congress.

In 1922, Marshall played 155 games simultaneously at the National Club in Montreal, Canada, a world record. He scored 126 wins, 21 draws, and 8 losses in just over 7 hours. One week later, when Marshall returned to New York, he replayed every single move of each game, he was able to remember 154 of the 155 games.

In the 1930s, Marshall captained the U.S. team to four gold medals at four Chess Olympiads. During one round, he returned to the board and found that his teammates had agreed to three draws. After he finished his own game, he gave each of them a stern talk individually on how draws do not win matches.

In 1936, after holding the U.S. championship title for 27 years, he relinquished it to the winner of a championship tournament. The first such tournament was sponsored by the National Chess Federation and held in New York. The Marshall Chess Club donated the trophy, and the first winner was Samuel Reshevsky.

==Assessment==
Marshall was best known for his great tactical skill. One aspect of this was the &quot;Marshall swindle&quot;, where a trick would turn a lost game around. Andrew Soltis writes that, &quot;In later years his prowess at rescuing the irretrievable took on magical proportions&quot;. Not so well known now, but appreciated in his day, was his endgame skill.

==Opening theory==

Frank Marshall has a number of chess opening variations named after him. Two gambit variations that are still theoretically important today are named after him. One is the &quot;Marshall Attack&quot; in the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d5). Marshall&#x27;s first well-known game with this opening was against José Capablanca in 1918, although Marshall had previously played it in other games that did not gain widespread attention. Even though Capablanca won in a game widely regarded as a typical example of his defensive genius, Marshall&#x27;s opening idea became quite popular. Black gets good attacking chances and scores close to 50 percent with the Marshall, an excellent result for Black. The Marshall Attack is so respected that many top players often choose to avoid it with &quot;Anti-Marshall&quot; variations such as 8.a4.

During his early career, Marshall was primarily known as a colorful tactical player in the Morphy tradition. When playing the White pieces, he normally used e4 openings such as King&#x27;s Gambit and Vienna Game. As Black, he favored the Albin Countergambit as an answer to the Queen&#x27;s Gambit. By the 1920s, most elite chess players had switched entirely to d4 openings and a more positional style of play, and Marshall changed his playing style to adapt to the times. In his later years, he often used the Caro–Kann Defense and Indian Defenses.

An important gambit in the Semi-Slav Defense is also named after Marshall. That &quot;Marshall Gambit&quot; begins 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 e6 4.e4 The main line runs 4...dxe4 5.Nxe4 Bb4+ 6.Bd2 (6.Nc3 saves the pawn but is not considered dangerous) Qxd4 7.Bxb4 Qxe4+ 8.Be2 with and unclear play.

Another opening named after Marshall is the Marshall Defense to the Queen&#x27;s Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4 Nf6). It is generally considered inferior to the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined (2...e6), Slav Defense (2...c6), and Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted (2...dxc4).

==Notable games==
===Marshall&#x27;s famous 23...Qg3===
In his famous game against Stepan Levitsky, Marshall concluded with a of his queen, allowing it to be captured three different ways, all of which would lead to imminent checkmate or an endgame with a losing disadvantage for white.
:Levitsky vs. Marshall, Breslau 1912: 1.d4 e6 2.e4 d5 3.Nc3 c5 4.Nf3 Nc6 5.exd5 exd5 6.Be2 Nf6 7.0-0 Be7 8.Bg5 0-0 9.dxc5 Be6 10.Nd4 Bxc5 11.Nxe6 fxe6 12.Bg4 Qd6 13.Bh3 Rae8 14.Qd2 Bb4 15.Bxf6 Rxf6 16.Rad1 Qc5 17.Qe2 Bxc3 18.bxc3 Qxc3 19.Rxd5 Nd4 20.Qh5 Ref8 21.Re5 Rh6 22.Qg5 Rxh3 23.Rc5 (see diagram) Qg3 (This move is considered one of the most brilliant moves ever played; Tim Krabbé ranked it third. Legend has it that the spectators showered the board with gold pieces after Marshall&#x27;s last move. Chess historian Edward Winter discusses the differing accounts here.) 

===Win over Capablanca with black===
Although Marshall lost to Capablanca far more often than he won (+2−20=28), they had many draws and Marshall was one of only a few players ever to beat Capablanca with the black pieces.

:Capablanca vs. Marshall, Havana 1913: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Bg4 7.0-0 Nc6 8.c3 Be7 9.Nbd2 Nxd2 10.Bxd2 0-0 11.h3 Bh5 12.Re1 Qd7 13.Bb5 Bd6 14.Ne5 Bxe5 15.Qxh5 Bf6 16.Bf4 Rae8 17.Re3 Rxe3 18.fxe3 a6 19.Ba4 b5 20.Bc2 g6 21.Qf3 Bg7 22.Bb3 Ne7 23.e4 dxe4 24.Qxe4 c6 25.Re1 Nd5 26.Bxd5 cxd5 27.Qe7 Qc8 28.Bd6 h6 29.Rf1 f6 30.Re1 Rd8 31.Bc5 Kh7 32.Qf7 Qf5 33.Be7 Qd7 34.Kf1 Rf8 35.Qe6 Qxe6 36.Rxe6 Re8 37.Re2 Kg8 38.b3 Kf7 39.Bc5 Rxe2 40.Kxe2 f5 41.Kd3 Ke6 42.c4 bxc4+ 43.bxc4 g5 44.g4 f4 45.Bb4 Bf6 46.Bf8 dxc4+ 47.Kxc4 f3 48.d5+ Ke5 49.Kd3 Kf4 50.Bd6+ Be5 51.Bc5 Kg3 52.Ke4 Bf4 53.d6 f2 0–1

Capablanca rarely lost in the endgame.

<doc id="467534" wikidata="Q733942" url="?curid=467534" title="Grafton Elliot Smith">
<text>Sir Grafton Elliot Smith (15 August 1871 – 1 January 1937) was an Australian-British anatomist, Egyptologist and a proponent of the hyperdiffusionist view of prehistory. He believed in the idea that cultural innovations occur only once and that they spread geographically. Based on this, he traced the origins of many cultural and traditional practices across the world, including the New World, to ideas that he believed came from Egypt and in some instances from Asia. An expert on brain anatomy, he was one of the first to study Egyptian mummies using radiological techniques. He took an interest in extinct humanoids and was embroiled in controversy over the authenticity of the Piltdown Man.

==Professional career==
Smith was born in Grafton, New South Wales to Stephen Sheldrick Smith who had moved to Australia from London in 1860 and Mary Jane, née Evans. He received his early education from Grafton Public School where his father was headmaster. When the family moved to Sydney in 1883 he went to Darlington Public School before joining Sydney Boys High School. He attended evening classes on physiology by Thomas Anderson Stuart and took an early interest in biology. In an autobiographical note Smith noted that Stuart had shown them the convolutions of the human brain and declared that nobody understood them fully. Smith decided at that point that he would work towards understanding them. Accordingly, he went to study medicine at the University of Sydney in 1888 and received a Doctor of Medicine in 1895, with a dissertation on the fore-brain of the monotremes) and developed an interest in the anatomy of the human brain. He received a James King travelling scholarship and went to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1896. Afterwards he catalogued the human brain-collection of the British Museum.

Smith obtained an appointment at the Cairo School of Medicine in 1900 on the suggestion of his anthropologist friend Alexander Macalister. Smith became archaeological advisor to the archaeological survey of Nubia in the wake of plans to construct the Aswan Dam which threatened to drown numerous archaeological sites. Smith conducted investigations on the brains of Egyptian mummies. He was one of the first to non-destructively use x-rays to study mummies. Smith took a special interest in the pathologies indicated in ancient skeletal remains. He noted for instance that many Egyptian skulls had biparietal thinning which had been common in European aristocrats in the past. Smith hypothesized this was the result of wearing heavy wigs or headgear. From 1909 to 1919 he was Professor in anatomy in Manchester, 1919–1937 he held the chair of Anatomy at the University College London. He was elected President of the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland for 1924 to 1927. During World War I he took an interest in the neurology of shell shock, visiting military hospitals and serving on the British General Medical Council.

Smith was the leading specialist on the evolution of the brain of his day. Many of his ideas on the evolution of the primate brain still form the core of present scholarship. He proposed the following stages of development:
# a smell-dominated insectivore of the jumping shrew-type
# vision-dominated animals with an expanded cortex of tree-shrew-type
# acutely visioned, manually dexterous mammals of tarsius-type
# monkeys
# anthropoids using their hands to use and produce tools

==Honours and awards==
Smith was decorated by the Khedive of Egypt, Abbas Hilmy in 1909 with an Insignia of the Third Class of the Imperial Ottoman Order of the Osmaniah. He became Fellow of the Royal Society in 1907, FRCP, cross of the French Legion of Honour, and was knighted in the 1934 Birthday Honours. In 1912 he received the Royal Medal of the Royal Society, in 1930 the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons, in 1936 the Huxley Memorial Medal from the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland.

==European hypothesis==

British anthropologists Arthur Keith and Grafton Elliot Smith both supported the European origin of humankind as opposed to models of Asian and African origin. In several of his works, Smith argued that Europe was the cradle of humanity, identifying a European Mediterranean race as the occupants of the original home of modern humans. His cradle was large, as he claimed the Mediterranean race had occupied the Levant, Egypt and western Europe, including the British Isles. He especially linked the Mediterranean race to the civilisation of Egypt. Smith&#x27;s arguments later became known as his theory of diffusionism. According to Smith and William James Perry, Egypt was the source of all cultural innovations and the ultimate source of human civilisation.

According to Smith, &quot;Man did not become truly erect until his brain had developed in a very particular way to make it possible for him to use his hands&quot;. That line of reasoning reinforced the European origin of human, which Smith and Keith supported, as the mostly large brained specimens such as the Cro-Magnon had been found in Europe.

===Hyperdiffusionism===
The term &#x27;hyperdiffusionism&#x27; seems to have been coined by the British archaeologist Glyn Daniel in his book &quot;The Idea of Prehistory&quot; (1962) with a somewhat derogatory intention. It was intended to represent extremes of diffusionism, a theme popular in early 20th century archaeology that itself has been subject to criticism. Smith believed that all megalithic phenomena, whether in Northwestern Europe, India, Japan or Mesoamerica, had originated in Ancient Egypt. &quot;Small groups of people, moving mainly by sea, settled at certain places and there made rude imitations of the Egyptian monuments of the Pyramid Age.&quot; (Smith 1911, ix). Smith believed in a direct diffusion to Syria, Crete, East Africa, Southern Arabia and Sumer, and other areas were influenced by secondary diffusion. The Neolithic culture of Europe was derived from Egypt as well, according to Smith. He even interpreted a mummy from a Torres Strait island as definitely being indicative of an Egyptian influence. The concept of hyperdiffusionism is now referred to by more neutral terms (when referring to the Americas) such as Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact.

Smith interpreted a small carving detail in Copán stela B as an elephant, an animal unknown in the New World. Alfred Maudslay had described the detail as being a stylised tapir. Smith argued that the carving shows an elephant with a mahout atop it. He went on to point out many Asian features in the sculpture in his book &quot;Elephants and ethnologists&quot; (1924).

====Egypt====
Egypt held a fortunate geographical position that made contacts to western Asia and the Mediterranean possible, while being safe from invasions. The fertile soil led to ample leisure, in art and the crafts could be cultivated. Smith believed that agriculture had originated in Egypt and only later spread to Mesopotamia. &quot;The earliest cultivators of the soil in Egypt were in fact laying the foundations not merely of agriculture and irrigation but of all the arts and craft, the social organization and religious beliefs which became an integral part of the civilization that was being built up sixty centuries ago and in later ages was diffused throughout the world.&quot; (Smith 1911, 6)

Artificial irrigation led to cooperation and the development of a central government that was based on professional knowledge, a rule of hydraulic engineers. The prosperity of everybody depended on a successful administration and a strong central government (cf. Karl Wittfogel&#x27;s hydraulic hypothesis). Later on, the leading engineer became a sacred king (cf. Henri Frankfort) and a god (Osiris) after death. Ritual and magic formed the germs of the first sciences, of biology and physics. The building of tombs initiated the development of architecture.

Other inventions of the Egyptians were:
*Weaving
*Metal working (gold and copper)
*Calendar
*Seagoing ships
*&quot;Art of shaving&quot;
*Wigs
*Hats
*Pillows

The invention of metallurgy was the most important, as it quickened the pace of invention, widened the scope of human endeavour, stimulated the advancement of arts and crafts, and awakened courage and the spirit of great adventure. The search for copper was to become the most important factor in the universal spread of civilisation. Prospectors settled in foreign countries and introduced agriculture, burial customs, and their religion as well.

At first, Smith remained vague on the reasons for the spread of Egyptian influence to places without mineral deposits like Polynesia. However, in 1915 William James Perry, a professor of comparative religion at the University of Manchester, advanced the view that the &quot;megalith-builders&quot; were looking for pearls and precious stones, which Smith adopted as well.

Smith did not believe that the spread of culture was necessarily connected to a certain race, in contrast to other diffusionists, like the German prehistorian Gustaf Kossinna. While he saw a racial affinity between the Egyptians and the first agriculturalists of southern Europe, both being of the &quot;brown race,&quot; the spread of civilisation was mainly a spread of ideas, not of tribes or people.

However, in &quot;The Ancient Egyptians and their Influence Upon the Civilization of Europe&quot;, written in 1911, he clearly demonstrates a steep rise in &quot;Asiatic traits (Armenoid, Alpine, Celtic),&quot; within the Egyptian aristocracy, to Dynastic Egypt itself (among other pre-historical phenomena).

In early 1923, Smith wrote a series of articles for The Daily Telegraph regarding the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Those articles deal with the condition of royal and other mummies that were found before 1922. Smith stated that Tutankhamen &quot;narrowly escaped&quot; the fate of being &quot;hacked to pieces&quot; by robbers, as was the case with the mummy of Amenhotep II.

====History====
In the age of Colonialism, hyperdiffusionism proved attractive, as it showed how missionaries, engineers and prospectors had spread civilisation all over the earth, as the colonial nations believed that they were doing themselves.

Later on, hyperdiffusionism supplied a single simple explanation of the complex process of neolithisation that made it attractive to amateur archaeologists worldwide. It could be used to retain a Eurocentric view on history in the face of increasing evidence for impressive autochthonous development, such as in Zimbabwe (Great Zimbabwe), Polynesia (Easter Island), and Micronesia (Nan Madol on the island of Pohnpei).

Now, it is widely believed that the megalithic graves of Britain, Ireland, France, Portugal, the Netherlands, Denmark, northern Germany, and Poland are much older than the Egyptian pyramids, and the Mesoamerican pyramids are more recent and considered to be local cultural innovations.

== Private life ==
His father had migrated to New South Wales from London. He had attended a working men&#x27;s college under John Ruskin and later became a teacher and headmaster in Grafton, New South Wales. His older brother (Stephen H. Smith) was later Director of Education in New South Wales; his younger brother (Stewart Arthur Smith) was Acting Professor of Anatomy at the University of Sydney.

He married Kathleen Macreadie in 1902 just before moving to Cairo. During his time in London, he lived variously in Hampstead, Gower Street, and at Regent&#x27;s Park. During his London years, he became a friend of W. H. R. Rivers.

Smith&#x27;s youngest son, Stephen Smith, died in an accident in 1936. Smith spent his final year in a nursing home in London.

Grafton Smith died on New Year&#x27;s Day 1 January 1937 at Broadstairs in Kent.

<text>The [[Wells Fargo]] Plaza, formerly the Allied Bank Plaza and First Interstate Bank Plaza, is a skyscraper located at 1000 Louisiana Street in Downtown Houston, Texas in the United States.

This building is currently the 20th-tallest Building in the United States, the second tallest building in Texas and Houston, after Houston&#x27;s JPMorgan Chase Tower, and the tallest all-glass building in the Western Hemisphere. It is the tallest building named for Wells Fargo.

From street level, the building is tall and contains 71 floors. It extends four more stories below street level. Only the Wells Fargo Plaza offers direct access from the street to the Houston tunnel system (a series of underground walkways connecting many of downtown Houston&#x27;s office towers); otherwise, entry points are from street-level stairs, escalators, and elevators located inside buildings that are connected to the tunnel.

Wells Fargo Plaza features a wide variety of fine amenities for its tenants including The Houstonian Lite Health Club located on the 14th floor.

Sky lobbies on the 34/35th and 58/59th floors are publicly accessible and offer views of Downtown Houston. These sky lobbies are served by double-decker elevators and primarily serve as transfer floors to local elevators.

The entrance of the skyscraper appears in the final scene of 1989 American thriller film Cohen and Tate (also known as &quot;Cohen &amp; Tate&quot;)

==History==

It was designed by Richard Keating, FAIA, while a partner of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. In 1983, the building lost a large number of windows during Hurricane Alicia. Originally named the Allied Bank Plaza, it was renamed to the First Interstate Bank Plaza in 1988. First Interstate Bancorp was then taken over in 1996 by Wells Fargo, therefore transferring ownership of the building.

In 1993, the Consulate-General of the United Kingdom in Houston leased in the First Interstate Plaza. In 1995 Koll Real Estate lost the management contract for the First Interstate Plaza. In 1996, NGC Corp. (now Dynegy) leased in the First Interstate Plaza. The company moved over 700 jobs from a suburban office building along U.S. Route 290 (Northwest Freeway) to the Wells Fargo Plaza. In 2012, the company moved out of the building as part of downsizing initiatives while undergoing bankruptcy procedures.

In 2006, Targa Resources signed an 11-year lease to occupy of space in the Wells Fargo Plaza. Targa expanded from its subleased space and began to occupy floors 43 through 46. With the expiration of the lease, Targa has since moved to 811 Louisiana. In 2007, CB Richard Ellis became the exclusive leasing agent for Wells Fargo Plaza. As of October of that year the building was 91% leased. The leased space consists mostly of large tenants, with some mid-sized tenants occupying space.

In December 2014, PwC moved into the offices formerly occupied by Dynegy.

==Tenants==
The Houston office of PwC is primarily located in Suite 5800.

The Houstonian Lite club is located in a area on the 14th floor. It includes group exercise studio space, locker rooms, a private Pilates studio, and exercise equipment. The club, operated by The Redstone Cos., operators of The Houstonian Hotel, was the third &quot;Houstonian Lite&quot; club in Greater Houston, and it was scheduled to open in mid-to-late March 2006. It had been under construction since December 2005. The owner of the Wells Fargo building, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and Metropolitan Tower Realty Company Inc., and the building manager and lessor, Lincoln Property Co., developed the health club.

The Consulate-General of the United Kingdom in Houston was formerly located in Suite 1900. At one point the Consulate-General of Japan in Houston was located in Suite 5300 and later Suite 2300; as of 2008 the consulate now resides in 2 Houston Center. At one point the Consulate-General of Switzerland in Houston resided in Suite 5670; the mission, which at a later point moved to Two Allen Center, no longer exists.

The office of the US Attorney for the Southern District of Texas is located in Suite 2300.

When Hit Video USA existed, its studios were in the building.

Greenberg Trauig (one of the top ten largest law firms in the USA) is also a tenant of Wells Fargo Plaza.

The headquarters of Susman Godfrey is located in Wells Fargo Plaza.

<doc id="467546" wikidata="Q3990180" url="?curid=467546" title="Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth">
<text>Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, abbreviated as TOPY, was a British magical organization, fellowship and chaos magic network founded in 1981 by Genesis P-Orridge, lead member of multimedia group Psychic TV. The network, including later members of Coil and Current 93, was a loosely federated organization of members and initiates operating as an order of ceremonial magic and sex magic, as well as an experimental artistic collective.

==Creation and influence==
Their early network consisted of a number of &quot;stations&quot; worldwide including TOPY-CHAOS for Australia, TOPYNA for North America and TOPY Station 23 for the United Kingdom and Europe. Smaller, &quot;grass-roots&quot;-level sub-stations called &quot;Access Points&quot; were located throughout America and Europe. Throughout its existence, TOPY has been an influential group in the underground chaos magic scene.

==Theory and praxis==

Potential TOPY members were encouraged to make magical sigils of a certain prescribed nature. These acts were to be performed on the 23rd hour (11:00pm) of the 23rd day of each month. If an individual chose to do so, they were invited to mail their sigils to a central location where the magical energy in them could be used to enhance others.

==Schisms==
In the early 1990s, a rift occurred within the network when Genesis P-Orridge of Psychic TV, one of the few founding members still involved at that time, and probably the best known public face of TOPY during the 1980s, announced their departure from the organization. This was later exacerbated with Genesis P-Orridge later claiming to have shut down the network upon leaving and requesting that the group no longer use the registered trademark of the Psychick Cross. Some of the remaining members of the network chose not to go along with this and carried on with their activities. TOPY continued to grow and evolve throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century while Genesis P-Orridge moved on to other projects such as The Process, as well as a similar project to TOPY called Topi.

Genesis P-Orridge&#x27;s TOPY has been criticized by Dan Siepmann as being a front for abuses of power and developing an actual cult of personality.

==Key texts==
There have been a number of texts produced by &quot;Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth&quot; to expound its philosophies. Some of the key texts produced over the years have been:

* &quot;Axiom 23&quot;
* &quot;Thee Sigilizers Handbook&quot;
* &quot;Thee Grey Book&quot; (which was important during the 1980s but is no longer distributed by TOPY)
* &quot;Thee Black Book&quot;
*&quot;Broadcast&quot; (the journal of TOPY)
*&quot;Thee Psychick Bible&quot; is a compilation of TOPY literature, with updates and personal additions by Genesis P-Orridge, edited by Jason Louv with foreward by Carl Abrahamsson (author).

<text>Mike Carey (born 1959), also known by his pen name M. R. Carey, is a British writer of comic books, novels and films, whose credits include the long-running &quot;The Sandman&quot; spin-off series &quot;Lucifer&quot;, a three-year stint on &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, as well as his creator-owned titles &quot;Crossing Midnight&quot; and &quot;The Unwritten&quot; for DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo imprint, a lengthy run on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot;, the 2014 novel &quot;The Girl with All the Gifts&quot; and its 2016 film adaptation.

==Early life and career==
Carey was born in Liverpool, England, in 1959. He describes his young self as &quot;one of those ominously quiet kids... [who] lived so much inside my own head I only had vestigial limbs&quot;. As a child, he maintained an interest in comics, writing and drawing primitive stories to entertain his younger brother. He studied English at St Peter&#x27;s College, Oxford and, upon graduation, became a teacher. He taught for 15 years before moving on to writing comics.

==Writing career==
After a series of one-off jobs for independent comics companies, including a biographical Ozzy Osbourne comic and a fantasy tale starring the band Pantera, Carey became a contributor to the British comics anthology &quot;2000 AD&quot;, where he co-created the original series &quot;Thirteen&quot; and &quot;Carver Hale&quot;, and wrote two series for &quot;The Sandman Presents&quot; line published by DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo imprint, &quot;Lucifer&quot; and &quot;Petrefax&quot;. &quot;Lucifer&quot; was subsequently extended into an ongoing series, which Carey wrote for its entire 75-issue run. Further work for Vertigo includes a 40-issue run on the imprint&#x27;s flagship title &quot;Hellblazer&quot; as well as the spin-off graphic novel &quot;All His Engines&quot;, several creator-owned endeavors, such as the six-part mini-series &quot;Faker&quot; with art by Jock and the ongoing series &quot;Crossing Midnight&quot; with artist Jim Fern, and two more &quot;The Sandman&quot; spin-offs in the form of graphic novels, &quot;The Sandman Presents: The Furies&quot; and &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, both created with artist John Bolton. In 2009, Carey launched his longest creator-owned series to date, &quot;The Unwritten&quot;, co-created with the &quot;Lucifer&quot; collaborator Peter Gross and featuring covers by Yuko Shimizu.

Other work for DC Comics includes the long-delayed reboot of Wildstorm&#x27;s &quot;Wetworks&quot; and two graphic novels for the Minx imprint aimed at the teenage female audience, one of which was co-written by Carey with his daughter Louise. In 2003, Carey was announced as the new writer of the &quot;Firestorm&quot; ongoing series, however, he left the project few months after the announcement as the editors wanted to take it in a different direction. The series was launched in 2004 with Dan Jolley as the writer.

In 2006, Carey took over the writing duties of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; series, which was soon rebranded into &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;. He saw the title through a number of inter-title crossovers between the various X-Men books such as &quot;Endangered Species&quot;, &quot;Messiah Complex&quot;, &quot;Original Sin&quot; (a crossover between &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot; and &quot;&quot; that was tentatively titled &quot;Dark Deception&quot;) and &quot;Age of X&quot;. Carey wrote &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot; for six years and contributed a number of X-Men stories to other publications, such as two tie-ins to the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; crossover storyline, the four-issue mini-series &quot;Secret Invasion: X-Men&quot; and an eight-page story in the one-shot anthology &quot;Secret Invasion: Who Do You Trust?&quot; featuring Abigail Brand of S.W.O.R.D., a retelling of Beast&#x27;s origin story as part of the &quot;X-Men: Origins&quot; line and an Iceman serial in the &quot;X-Men: Manifest Destiny&quot; anthology series. Other work for Marvel includes the comic book adaptation of Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot;.

Carey&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, was released in the UK by Orbit books in April 2006, and as a hardcover in the US in July 2007. Its sequel, &quot;Vicious Circle&quot;, was published in October 2006, and the following three novels in the series, &quot;Dead Men&#x27;s Boots&quot;, &quot;Thicker Than Water&quot;, and &quot;The Naming of the Beasts&quot;, followed in September 2007, March 2009 and September 2009, respectively. What would have been Carey&#x27;s first feature film, the erotic ghost story &quot;Frost Flowers&quot;, was reported to be in pre-production in June 2006, with filming to begin that September under the direction of Andrea Vecchiato. Carey was also reported to work on the TV adaptation of his comic book series &quot;The Stranded&quot;, a co-production between Virgin Comics and the Syfy network. Also for Virgin, Carey took part in the short-lived Coalition Comix project created in association with Myspace, where users could suggest ideas for a comic which then would be used during its production.

In 2014, Carey published another novel, &quot;The Girl with All the Gifts&quot;. That same year, the screenplay of the same name, written by Carey concurrently with the novel, appeared on the Brit List. Filming began in May 2015, with Colm McCarthy directing and Gemma Arterton, Paddy Considine, Glenn Close and Sennia Nanua starring. The story, depicting a dystopian future where most of humanity is wiped out by a fungal infection, focuses on the struggle of a scientist, a teacher and two soldiers who embark on a journey of survival with a special young girl named Melanie.

<text>The Tambov Rebellion of 1920–1922 was one of the largest and best-organized peasant rebellions challenging the Bolshevik government during the Russian Civil War. The uprising took place in the territories of the modern Tambov Oblast and part of the Voronezh Oblast, less than southeast of Moscow.

In Soviet historiography, the rebellion was referred to as the Antonovschina (&quot;Antonov&#x27;s mutiny&quot;), so named after Alexander Antonov, a former official of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, who opposed the government of the Bolsheviks. It began in August 1920 with resistance to the forced confiscation of grain and developed into a guerrilla war against the Red Army, Cheka units and the Soviet Russian authorities. The bulk of the peasant army was destroyed by large Red Army reinforcements using chemical weapons in the summer of 1921; smaller groups continued resistance until the following year. It is estimated that around 100,000 people were arrested and around 15,000 killed during the suppression of the uprising.

The movement was later portrayed by the Soviets as anarchical banditry, similar to other left-wing anti-Bolshevik movements that opposed them during this period.

== Background ==
In 1904, Alexander Antonov was sentenced to twenty years in prison for blowing up a train, but received an amnesty from the Russian Provisional Government following the February Revolution and returned to his native Tambov, where he served in the local militia in Kirsanov. As the Provisional Government refused to discuss agrarian reform, he joined the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries.

The peasants of Tambov largely supported the October Revolution, since Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Decree on Land legalized the expropriation of property. Nevertheless, the Bolsheviks had problems in maintaining control of the governorate. Unlike in the cities, the Bolsheviks had hardly any supporters in the rural regions, where in the elections of 1917 the Socialist Revolutionary Party had won large majorities. In March 1918, the Bolshevik delegates in Tambov were even thrown out of the local soviets, following the ratification of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

Following the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, the newly established Russian Soviet Republic adopted the policy of war communism, in which food for the cities was obtained by compulsory requisition from the villages, without financial compensation. This was met with the resistance of the peasant population, especially as the requisitions were often violent in nature. Likewise, the amount of grain to be requisitioned were not measured according to production. Instead, commissions gave a rough estimate based on pre-war production, so that devastation, crop failures, and population decline were not included. Before the revolution, the peasants in Tambov produced around one million tonnes of grain. Of these, one-third was exported. On the basis of these figures, which did not include the dislocations of the civil war in the countryside, a high target for the procurement of grain was set. The peasants often responded by reducing their acreage, as they no longer had the economic incentive to produce surpluses, which made the confiscations ordered from above hit them even harder.

For the most part, the peasants had been indifferent to Bolshevik ideology, but they came to hate the Bolsheviks for their forced requisitions, which had put them at the limit of survival, and for the forced levies that had created numerous fugitives. In the summer of 1919, Antonov fled to the forest and formed a gang that murdered several Bolshevik activists. This is how the first anti-Bolshevik guerrilla movements arose, made up of Red Army deserters, Socialist-Revolutionaries and peasants who resisted the searches in the forests. Their first acts were assassinating unpopular state officials and raiding state farms. They killed more than 200 government grain collectors and over the next year their forces grew steadily, growing from an initial 150 to 6,000 by early summer 1920, but that would have to wait until after the defeat of Anton Denikin&#x27;s White movement for there to be a real mass uprising. The other leaders of this force were Alexander Antonov&#x27;s younger brother, , and the SR .

==Outbreak==
On 19 August 1920, a revolt broke out in the small town of Khitrovo, where a military requisitioning detachment of the Red Army had appropriated everything they could and &quot;beat up elderly men of seventy in full view of the public&quot;. In anticipation of an attack by the Red Army to enforce the procurement of grain, the farmers of the village armed themselves. Since only a few rifles were available, this was partly done with pitchforks and clubs. Other villages soon joined in the uprising against the Soviet authorities, and succeeded in repelling the Red Army.

The peasants rebels, after their first success, attempted to capture Tambov, the capital of the governorate. There, however, they were scattered by Red machine guns barely ten kilometers from their target. It was here that Alexander Antonov, a radical Left Socialist-Revolutionary, led the movement into a guerilla war against the Reds. Before the uprising, Antonov and a few comrades had fought an underground insurrection against the Bolsheviks and had been sentenced to death. Since he was able to escape capture by the Soviet authorities, he was a kind of folk hero to the peasants. He demanded that the free trade and movement of goods should be allowed, that the grain requisitions should be ended and the Soviet administration and the Cheka dissolved. His troops carried out surprise raids on railway junctions, &quot;kolkhoz&quot; and the Soviet authorities. They were supported by the population and used the villages for cover and rest. Likewise, they often disguised themselves as Red Army soldiers to move about the countryside or to exaggerate the element of surprise.

The insurgent peasants organized themselves through the Union of Working Peasants (, STK), which functioned as the political organization of the insurgents and with which Antonov worked. Having their own political program gave them a strength and coherence that other peasant uprisings lacked. However, this movement was still based on the weariness of the population but without having a clear idea of how to replace the government. Instead, Antonov dreamed of marching on Moscow and ending Bolshevik rule. In May 1921, the Union proclaimed the which would rule until the holding of a democratically elected constituent assembly. The Republic used the pre-revolutionary flag of Russia, and the slogan &quot;Long live the &quot;, one of the slogans of the White movement, became one of the mottos of the rebels and the Republic.

Antonov organized the farmers on the model of the Red Army in 18–20 regiments with their own political commissars, reconnaissance departments and communication departments. Likewise, he introduced a strict discipline. The farmers used the Red flag as their standard and thus claimed the central symbol of the revolution. They had 14,000 or 18,000 men, mostly consisting of deserters from the Red Army. Of these, five to seven thousand had firearms. By the end of the month, the rebels numbered six groups, each totaling 4,000 men with a dozen machine guns and several artillery pieces. As the Bolshevik authorities were busy with the Polish-Soviet War and Pyotr Wrangel&#x27;s offensive in northern Tavria, they only had 3,000 unreliable troops in Tambov province. These soldiers had been drafted from the local villages and often had little motivation to fight members of their own class.

The rebels were able to control large parts of the region and managed to capture railway trains transporting requisitioned grain. The grain intended to supply Red Army units was instead re-distributed by Antonov&#x27;s men to local farmers. The rebellion also spread to parts of other provinces: Voronezh, Saratov and Penza. This territory was populated by more than three million people, 90% farmers and artisans. The region was densely populated, with rich, forested land that offered many jobs, especially as the land had been appropriated in 1917 and the owners expelled. But the demands of the Bolshevik government and the Russian Civil War prevented them from profiting, which only encouraged the insurrection.

In the areas controlled by the rebels, all Soviet institutions were abolished. Around 1,000 members of the Russian Communist Party were killed by the insurgents. By October 1920, the Bolsheviks had completely lost control of the rural territory of the governorate, dominating only the city of Tambov itself and a number of smaller urban settlements. After numerous deserters from the Red Army joined it, the peasant army numbered over 50,000 fighters. The rebel militia proved highly effective and even infiltrated the Tambov Cheka.

Towards the end of October, the head of the in the Tambov Governorate, , engaged in a series of battles with the rebels. According to his letters, he killed 3,000, wounded 300, and captured 1,000 along with copious amounts of weapons, ammunition, and supplies (such as a telephone and a field kitchen). His casualties were 90 dead and less than 200 wounded. However, he was blamed for the rebellion and removed. Some sources say the rebels numbered just 8,000 horsemen in November.

== Climax of the rebellion ==
On 5 November, two to six thousand rebels, mostly on horseback, attacked the railway station at Sampur in two coordinated groups, capturing an artillery cannon, some machine guns, and numerous revolvers and rifles. However, they failed in their attempt to sabotage the railway lines and quickly withdrew. At the time, Bolshevik reports said that two thousand partisans were still in the woods of Novokhopyorsk, near the station. The main source of information that the peasants had about what happened on other fronts were the red prisoners. In that month, there were barely 5,000 Bolsheviks in the region.

At the height of his power, thanks to their strong popular support, between October 1920 and January 1921, the rebels mobilized 50,000 partisans. By February 1921, they were between 20,000 and 40,000-strong, with half of them acting as full-time combatants and the other half part-time. Around 6,000 were mounted, hindering the government troops, whose lack of mobility undermined their effectiveness.

But they never formed an &quot;organized guerrilla army&quot;. Because of this, most of their actions were impulsive assaults orchestrated by each band against the Bolshevik detachments in charge of requisitioning grain or repressing the villagers. This lack of coordination was, in addition to their poor weapons and training, ultimately decisive in their defeat.

They were organized in two armies divided into a total of 21 regiments. Their use of guerrilla warfare was based on the old tactic of launching surprise attacks and fleeing immediately afterwards, thanks to their superior knowledge of the terrain and the mobility of their cavalry. Each village was in charge of equipping and maintaining a group of these combatants, which was easy since many were locals defending their own communities. That localism also played into their hands. On the contrary, being too closed in on themselves prevented them from seeking allies in other peasant movements or marching against the big cities, the control of which was what the Bolsheviks worried about because their source of support was the industrial proletariat.

By the end of the year the greens had achieved one of the main objectives, the reds had stopped sending units to their territories to requisition grain. The officials in the south of Tambov were incapable of such action, as their resources were destined only to garrison the villages under their control. But the north was at peace, not being a large food-producing region, it never lived through the requisitions that had sparked the revolt. The lack of heavy weapons prevented the rebels from taking over the cities, which became havens for communists and government officials. During that December, reinforcements from the Cheka began to arrive, numbering 3,500 combatants in the area. Two months later its leader, Felix Dzerzhinski, would arrive to direct its operations.

During this time garrison officers and local Bolshevik militants complained of their ever-increasing abandonment by Moscow, from where fewer and fewer supplies and reinforcements were sent to them. In fact the military circles of the Red command had decided to concentrate on a great campaign of pacification of Tambov: as soon as their troops flooded the province the movement would soon be finished. In addition, it was increasingly difficult to help them because their main communication links, the armored trains, were continuously attacked in the area. During the winter of 1920–1921, food reserves in many towns were exhausted, as in Kozlov and Morshank, towns located on the edge of the rebel zone and whose communist garrison saw most of its inhabitants leave or turn to the black market to survive.

On 23 January 1921, 250 mounted cadets of the 6th Volche-Karachan regiment managed to defend the town of Borisoglebsk from a large rebel contingent. For the Bolsheviks, it was key to keep Borisoglebsk and Kirsanov in their hands, since these were their bastions in the middle of the fields controlled by the rebels. During that month, the Bolshevik authorities demobilized 4,000 locals who served in their garrisons because they were not trusted. They immediately joined the partisans.

By this time, only half of the desired grain had been collected by the Bolshevik requisition squads. Antonov-Ovseyenko noticed from his own experience that every other farmer in Tambov was starving. To win over the population, Nikolai Bukharin was commissioned to draw up &quot;non-coercive measures&quot;, in which he recommended that the required grain quotas be lowered. In response, on 2 February 1921, the Soviet leadership announced the end of the &quot;&quot;prodrazvyorstka&quot;, and issued a special decree directed at peasants from the region implementing the &quot;prodnalog&quot;&quot; policy. The new policy was essentially a tax on grain and other foodstuffs. This was done before the 10th Congress of the Bolsheviks, when the measure was officially adopted. The announcement began circulating in the Tambov area on 9 February 1921.

On 20 March, a general amnesty was also announced for anyone who surrendered. During the two weeks that the amnesty was in place, about 3,000 rebels capitulated, but very few with weapons in hand. By then, Bolshevik power had disappeared almost entirely from the region despite having 32,500 foot soldiers and 8,000 cavalry plus machine guns and cannons in the area.

By this time, the rebels were able to mobilize large field armies. On 11 April, Antonov gathered 5,000 partisans and launched a pincer attack on Rasskazovo (an hour prior he launched a diversionary attack on Nizhne-Spasskoe with a small force). The garrison consisted of a company of infantrymen, a unit of Bolshevik militants, a machine gun platoon, the Volga Infantry Brigade (which had arrived in January from Saratov), and the 2nd Cheka regiment, and it quickly collapsed. The rebels&#x27; goal was achieved: an artillery cannon with two or three hundred rounds, eleven machine guns, four hundred rifles, one hundred thousand ammunition, eighty telephones and 50 versts of cable. On 24 April, they gathered in the village of five to ten thousand fighters under the command of &quot;Vaska Karas&quot; (identified as ) and Vasili F. Selianski. Not everyone participated in the battle. They intended to take the town of Kirsanov, garrisoned by a Moscow infantry brigade led by cavalry commander V. I. Dmitrenko. A day later they launched two equally unsuccessful assaults, abandoning 22 machine guns, small arms and ammunition of the victors. Pursued by the enemy cavalry, the rebels had 2,000 dead in the following days according to estimates by the communist government.

==Suppression==
By January 1921, peasant revolts had spread to Samara, Saratov, Tsaritsyn, Astrakhan and Siberia. But with the end of the Polish–Soviet War and the defeat of General Wrangel, the Red Army could divert its regular troops into the area. In May 1921, Mikhail Tukhachevsky was ordered by Lenin as military commander-in-chief to suppress the uprising in Tambov. Assigned to him were tanks, heavy artillery and 100,000 soldiers, mostly special units of the Cheka, with additional Red Army units. As many members as possible of the communist youth organization Komsomol were assigned to him because they were considered politically loyal. The Red Army used armoured trains and engaged in the summary execution of &quot;civilians&quot;. The rebels responded with assassination attempts on Tukhachevsky and Ovseyenko, and the kidnapping and shooting of family members of members of the Party and Red Army.

On 6 May, Tukhachevsky announced his pacification campaign. That month a large army of between 50,000 and 100,000 Red soldiers reached the southern part of the oblast. The plan was to &quot;flood the rebellion area with troops&quot;. They included regular forces, Chinese and Hungarian internationalists and detachments of the Cheka, the and the , although the decisive contingents were the numerous cadets and horsemen who arrived. They were supported by 70 heavy artillery pieces, hundreds of machine guns, 3 armored units, a plane, armored trains and chemical weapons left over from World War I stockpiles.

On 31 May, seven armored vehicles commanded by General Ivan Fedko surprised 3,000 rebels in the village of Dve Sestritsy and dispersed them with heavy casualties. Two infantry brigades and one veteran cavalry brigade under General Grigori Kotovski were assigned to the Tambov sector. During the first two weeks of May, 15,000 Red Army officers concentrated in Tambov to prepare for the campaign. On the dawn of 1 June, Fedko with three vehicles armed with machine guns, Kotovski&#x27;s horsemen and the brigade of Siberian cavalry of M. D. Kovalev launched a surprise attack against Antonov and the 3,000 partisans with whom he occupied . Although the rebels managed to repulse the armored vehicles with their rifles, they fled before Kovalyov&#x27;s cavalry. On 6 June, the armored vehicles commanded by Fedko achieved another victory near Chernyshovo. Between 1 and 9 June, three Bolshevik forces led by Uborevich launched a coordinated attack with seven armored vehicles against the rebel stronghold, near the town of , and faced 2,000 rebels led by Antonov and Boguslavski in six battles, during which 800 partisans died. The region between Tambov and Kirsanov was pacified. These three forces intended to converge on Rzhaksa: Dmitrenko&#x27;s cavalry brigade (2,000 men from the Sampur in the Tambov uyezd), Kotovski&#x27;s cavalry brigade (1,000 soldiers from the Lomovis station in the Kirsanov uyezd) and the 14th cavalry brigade (1,000 cavalry up the Vorona River from Karai-Pushkino in Kirsanov&#x27;s uyezd). Two weeks later rebel commander Aleksandr Boguslavski was killed in combat. The same fate befell Tokmakov, Karas and Selianski.

On 12 June 1921, Tukhachevsky received permission from Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko to begin the use of chemical weapons against the remaining rebels. They ordered their troops to clear the forests with poison gas, stipulating that it &quot;must be carefully calculated, so that the layer of gas penetrates the forests and kills everyone hiding there.&quot; Publications in local Communist newspapers openly glorified liquidations of &quot;bandits&quot; with the poison gas. Antonov&#x27;s army was encircled and destroyed, leaving the rebellion practically defeated by the end of June. By the month of September, the rebels had been reduced to a thousand due to the massive arrival of red troops. By the end of that year, there were no more than 4,000 rebels left on the warpath. With almost all their leaders dead, the last parties took refuge in swamps and forests under constant persecution.

It took until the middle of 1922 for the province to be pacified completely. The Antonov brothers and several of their last followers were killed in combat against a Red detachment on 24 June 1922 in the village of , where they hid their few personal possessions. The Cheka wanted to arrest them and set fire to the house where they took refuge. When they tried to flee, they were shot down. By then, their movement was reduced to only a few groups.

== Consequences ==
As a result of the military operations against the rebels, around 6,000 of their fighters surrendered and were either shot or deported. The deportees were transferred from the local camps to special camps in the northern regions of Russia after the suppression of the uprising. These camps were otherwise reserved for officers of the White movement and captured insurgents from Kronstadt. In these camps there was a particularly high mortality of prisoners compared to the rest of the camp system. The devastation of the fighting and punitive measures, together with the Bolshevik agricultural policy, led to a famine in the areas of the insurgents. In addition to Tambov, large parts of Russia were affected in the following two years.

Family members of the rebels were usually used as hostages, others were held at random and in some cases entire villages were interned. Between 50,000 and 100,000 villagers including some 1,000 children, were interned in dedicated concentration camps in July 1921. There they suffered severely from cholera and typhus epidemics. The death rate is estimated to be around 15–20% per month for the fall of 1921. Relatively few were released or executed, &quot;barely&quot; 15,000 were shot. However, mass executions of suspected villagers and prisoners were frequent in the villages.

Some villages were burned to the ground. The properties confiscated from the arrested and exiled families were given to supporters or collaborators of the regime. The activities of the Cheka, the incorporation of thousands of locals into the Communist Party (with the benefits that it implied) and the concessions of the New Economic Policy helped the Bolsheviks in the spring of 1921 to defuse the situation, especially the end of grain requisitions.

The uprising made the Soviet leadership aware of its failure to manage relations with the peasants and is seen as one of the factors that prompted Lenin to initiate the New Economic Policy. The Russian sociologist and contemporary witness Pitirim Sorokin even concluded that the insurgents had forced the NEP by their actions. The new policy relied more on a natural tax on actual production instead of on compulsory collection of agricultural products. In the military field it is mentioned that the Soviet Army Commander Mikhail Frunze was impressed by the guerillas&#x27; resistance to regular forces. He therefore began studying guerrilla tactics as a commander in the Red Army. This is regarded as a precondition of the Soviet partisans&#x27; strategy in their World War II campaign against the Nazi invasion.

==Union of Working Peasants==
The Union of Working Peasants () was a local political organization that emerged from the rebellion in 1920. The organization was led by the former Social-Revolutionary politician Aleksandr Antonov. The goal of the organization was the &#x27;overthrow of the government of Communist-Bolsheviks&#x27;.

In December 1920, the Union of Working Peasants released a manifesto, stating their intention to overthrow the Bolshevik government and their aims in doing so:
==In popular culture==
* Some scenes of the rebellion are depicted in 2011 movie &quot;Once Upon a Time There Lived a Simple Woman&quot; by Andrei Smirnov.
* &quot;Apricot Jam and Other Stories&quot; (2010) by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. In a short story about Marshal Georgy Zhukov&#x27;s futile attempts at writing his memoirs, the retired Marshal reminisces about being a young officer fighting against the Union of Working Peasants. He recalls Mikhail Tukhachevsky&#x27;s arrival to take command of the campaign and his first address to his men. He announced that total war and scorched earth tactics are to be used against civilians who assist or even sympathize with the Union. Zhukov recalls how Tukhachevsky&#x27;s tactics were adopted and succeeded in breaking the uprising. In the process, however, they virtually depopulated the surrounding countryside.

<text>Mariangelo Accorso or Accursio (; 1489 or 14901544 or 1546) was an Italian writer and critic.

==Biography==
He was born at L&#x27;Aquila (Abruzzo), then part of the Kingdom of Naples.

He was a great favourite with Charles V, at whose court he resided for thirty-three years, and by whom he was employed on various foreign missions. To a perfect knowledge of Greek and Latin he added an intimate acquaintance with several modern languages. In discovering and collating ancient manuscripts, for which his travels abroad gave him special opportunities, he displayed uncommon diligence. His work entitled &quot;Diatribae in Ausonium, Solinum et Ovidium&quot; (1524) is a monument of erudition and critical skill. He was the first editor of the &quot;Letters&quot; of Cassiodorus, with his &quot;Treatise on the Soul&quot; (1538); and his edition of Ammianus Marcellinus (1533) contains five books more than any former one. The affected use of antiquated terms, introduced by some of the Latin writers of that age, is humorously ridiculed by him, in a dialogue in which an Oscan, a Volscian and a Roman are introduced as interlocutors (1531). Accorso was accused of plagiarism in his notes on Ausonius, a charge which he most solemnly and energetically repudiated.

<text>The Mansion House is the official residence of the Lord Mayor of London. It is a Grade I listed building. Designed by George Dance in the Palladian style, it was built primarily in the 1740s.

The Mansion House is used for some of the City of London&#x27;s most formal official functions, including two annual white tie dinners. At the Easter banquet, the main speaker is the Foreign Secretary, who then receives a reply from the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, i.e. the longest-serving ambassador. In early June, it is the turn of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give his or her &quot;Mansion House Speech&quot; about the state of the British economy. The most famous was the Mansion House Speech of 1911 by David Lloyd George, which warned the German Empire against opposing British influence during the period leading up to the First World War.

==History==


The Mansion House was built between 1739 and 1752, in the Palladian style, by the surveyor and architect George Dance the Elder. The Master Mason was John Deval.

The site, at the east end of Poultry, London, had previously been occupied by the Stocks Market, which by the time of its closure was mostly used for the sale of herbs. The construction was prompted by a wish to put an end to the inconvenient practice of lodging the Lord Mayor in one of the City livery company halls. Dance won a competition over designs solicited from James Gibbs and Giacomo Leoni, and uninvited submissions by Batty Langley and Isaac Ware. Construction was slowed down by the discovery of springs on the site, which meant piles had to be sunk to lay adequate foundations.

The original building had two clerestory roof extensions, nicknamed the &quot;Mayor&#x27;s Nest&quot; (a pun on &quot;mare&#x27;s nest&quot;) and &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;. In 1795 George Dance the Younger re-roofed the central courtyard, and had the &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; demolished. In the same year, the original grand staircase was removed to make way for a further two rooms. In 1835 the entrance steps were reduced to one flight, and in 1842 the &quot;Mayor&#x27;s Nest&quot; was demolished after the ballroom was reconstructed. The Lord Mayor&#x27;s private entrance in Walbrook was created in 1845, and in 1849 the former Swordbearer&#x27;s Room was converted into the Justice Room, effectively the magistrates&#x27; court of the City, until 1999 when the court removed to a building on the opposite side of Walbrook.

From 1873, with the Lord Mayor as its president, committee meetings of the Metropolitan Hospital Sunday Fund met at the Mansion House.

==Funding==
The Mansion House was paid for in an unusual way: the City authorities, all Church of England men, found a way to tax those of other Christian denominations, particularly the Rational Dissenters. A Unitarian named Samuel Sharpe, banker by day and amateur Egyptologist by night, wrote about it in the 1830s, striking a blow against the Test and Corporate Acts. The article was republished in 1872. Sharpe argues that the Mansion House &quot;remains as a monument of the unjust manner in which Dissenters were treated in the last century&quot; (i.e. the 18th, in contrast to his own 19th, century). William Edward Hartpole Lecky in his &quot;History of England during the Eighteenth Century&quot; (1878) describes the funding of the construction of the Mansion House as &quot;a very scandalous form of persecution&quot;.

There are over one hundred livery companies, the senior members of which form a special electorate known as Common Hall. In 1748 the City of London Corporation devised a Catch-22 situation to raise money, passing a by-law levying a heavy fine on any man who refused to stand for election, or who, once elected to office, refused to serve. In order to serve as a Sheriff of the City of London, the individual had to have &quot;taken the sacrament according to the Anglican rite&quot; within the past year. This was exactly what English Dissenters could not, in conscience, do:
&quot;It would appear almost incredible, if the facts were not widely attested, that under these circumstances the City of London systematically elected wealthy Dissenters to the office in order that they should be objected to and fined, and that in this manner it extorted no less than £15,000. The electors appointed these Dissenters with a clear knowledge that they would not serve, and with the sole purpose of extorting money. One of those whom they selected was blind; another was bedridden.&quot; Some tried to appeal, but the process was immensely risky and costly, with the City holding all the cards. Eventually a man named Evans began a challenge which lasted ten years; in 1767, the House of Lords, drawing on the Toleration Act 1688, agreed with Lord Mansfield and ruled to curtail the City&#x27;s abuse of power. In order to avoid civil disabilities such as this financially ruinous persecution, some Dissenters were known to take Communion in their parish church once a year; in the phraseology of the time, &quot;occasional conformity&quot; (see Occasional Conformity Act 1711). Thomas Abney rose to be Lord Mayor in this fashion.

The American author Mark Twain recounts the story in &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; (1889):

It reminded me of something I had read in my youth about the ingenious way in which the aldermen of London raised the money that built the Mansion House. A person who had not taken the Sacrament according to the Anglican rite could not stand as a candidate for sheriff of London. Thus Dissenters were ineligible; they could not run if asked, they could not serve if elected. The aldermen, who without any question were Yankees in disguise, hit upon this neat device: they passed a by-law imposing a fine of £400 upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for sheriff, and a fine of £600 upon any person who, after being elected sheriff, refused to serve. Then they went to work and elected a lot of Dissenters, one after another, and kept it up until they had collected £15,000 in fines; and there stands the stately Mansion House to this day, to keep the blushing citizen in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of Yankees slipped into London and played games of the sort that has given their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good and holy peoples that be in the earth.

==Architecture==

The Mansion House has three main storeys over a rusticated basement. The entrance facade has a portico with six Corinthian columns, supporting a pediment with a tympanum sculpture by Sir Robert Taylor, in the centre of which is a symbolic figure of the City of London trampling on her enemies. The building originally had two prominent and unusual attic structures at either end, which were removed in 1794 and 1843. The building is on a confined site. Sir John Summerson wrote that &quot;it leaves an impression of uneasily constricted bulk&quot;, adding that &quot;on the whole, the building is a striking reminder that good taste was not a universal attribute in the eighteenth century&quot;. The main reception room, the columned &quot;Egyptian Hall&quot;, was so named because Dance used an arrangement of columns deemed to be &quot;Egyptian&quot; by Vitruvius. No Egyptian motifs were employed. It has twenty niches for sculpture. There was originally an open courtyard, later occupied by a saloon.

The residence used to have its own court of law, since the Lord Mayor is the chief magistrate of the City while in office. There were eleven holding cells (ten for men and one, nicknamed &quot;the birdcage&quot;, for women). A famous prisoner here was the early 20th-century suffragette women&#x27;s rights campaigner Sylvia Pankhurst.

==Art collection==
The Mansion House is home to the Harold Samuel Collection of Dutch and Flemish Seventeenth Century Paintings, described as &quot;the finest collection of such works to be formed in Britain this century&quot;. It consists of 84 paintings and includes some outstanding works by artists including Hendrick Avercamp, Gerard Ter Borch, Pieter Claesz, Aelbert Cuyp, Frans Hals, Pieter de Hooch, Jacob van Ruisdael, Jan Steen, David Teniers the Younger and Willem van de Velde. The Mansion House also houses a plate collection, which includes among other treasures, the five ceremonial City of London swords.

==Public access==
The Mansion House is not generally open to the public. However, tours can be arranged through the diary office, and there are public tours most Tuesdays.

==Mansion House Street==
Mansion House Street is the short street at the front of the Mansion House, which connects Poultry, Queen Victoria Street and Bank Junction above Bank Underground station.

==Other==
Guildhall is another venue used for important City functions.

<text>The Amstrad PC1512 was Amstrad&#x27;s mostly IBM PC-compatible computer system, launched in 1986, and advertised with prices from £399 plus VAT. The system was also marketed in the US by Texas-based Vidco Inc. from the start of 1987. Later in 1987, a slightly updated version called the PC1640 was introduced, also marketed as the PC6400 and Sinclair PC500. Schneider branded machines for the German market were also sold.

==Features==
Whereas IBM&#x27;s PC (and almost all PC compatibles) had a power supply in a corner of the main case, the PC1512&#x27;s power supply was integrated with that of its monitor. The monitor had sufficient venting to cool itself by convection, instead of needing a fan. The PC1512 was therefore quieter than other PCs. Rumours circulated that an Amstrad PC would overheat, and while existing owners would note that this did not happen, new buyers were discouraged. As a result, later models had a cooling fan integrated into the main case. Another example of rumour was the suggestion that there were issues with the &#x27;unshielded&#x27; power supply in the monitor affecting an optional hard drive that could be installed at the back of the base unit and further that this would be solved by taping tin foil or aluminum foil over the back of the base unit or the bottom of the monitor to shield the hard drive. 

The PC1512 shipped with one or two 360KB 5¼-inch floppy drives, and optionally a hard drive (10 or 20 MB). The 5¼-inch floppy drive(s) could be replaced with 1.2 MB capacity versions. The machine was also marketed as the Sinclair PC500.

Amstrad licensed both MS-DOS 3.2 and Digital Research DOS Plus, which was largely compatible with MS-DOS and included some features from CP/M and the ability to read CP/M disks. Only one of these operating systems could be used at a time. They also licensed the GEM windowing system, which supported the customized CGA hardware of the 1512.

In 1987 the PC1512 was followed by the PC1640, which had 640 KB of RAM and an EGA-compatible graphics chipset, acquired from Paradise Systems, integrated into the main board of the machine, although only the ECD model could display all EGA modes. The PC1640 also allowed replacing the internal graphics adapter with a 8-bit ISA VGA graphics expansion board, which made it more versatile than the PC1512.

Both the PC1512 and the PC1640 could be upgraded with a NEC V30 CPU, that increased and added 80186 instruction set compatibility, and by adding an Intel 8087 mathematical coprocessor (FPU). Upgraded with the FPU, the PC1512 and PC1640 did outperform later PC architectures (i.e. 80286 w/o FPU) in numerical operations, which was highly useful for CAD and numerical calculations. Lotus 1-2-3 and Matlab supported the 8087. A performance benchmarks as conducted with Checkit compares the different models and configurations of the PC1512 and PC1640, with that of a fast 80286. 

Amstrad also attempted to expand its market share by selling computers in the United States. In the US the PC1640 was marketed as the PC6400 and included a 20 MB hard drive.

==Reception==

The PC1512, and also its successor the PC1640, sold very well. Part of it was explained because the basic model (one floppy drive, no hard disk) launched for £399, which made it one of the first cheap PCs in Europe. This price, which initially increased to £450, was restored in September 1987 amidst adjustments in Amstrad&#x27;s PC range.

Second, its design was compact and visually appealing. With the exception of the fan in the PC1640&#x27;s ECD monitor, both the PC1512 and the PC1640 were silent. This was a significant difference compared to the quite noisy PCs sold at the time. Although the Amstrad PC1512 and PC1640 had to compete against faster AT-type architectures at the time of their release, they were sufficiently powerful to run office software popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including WordPerfect 5.1, WordStar, Microsoft Word 4 and 5 for DOS, the spreadsheet Lotus 1-2-3, Matlab, and the database program dBase III+ as well as Ashton-Tate&#x27;s Framework II integrated office suite. The PC1512 and PC1640 were shipped with Digital Research&#x27;s GEM as a graphical shell, but could run also Geoworks Ensemble (up to Version 2.1), and Microsoft Windows (up to Version 3.0, that did support a &#x27;real mode&#x27;). 
The PC1512 significantly helped open up the European PC market to consumers as well as businesses, and Amstrad&#x27;s advertising of the PC1512 was aimed at homes rather than offices. The 1512&#x27;s influence was such that the UK PC magazine &quot;PC Plus&quot; originally targeted itself at the &quot;Amstrad PC 1512 and compatibles&quot;, since home ownership of other PCs at the time was rare.

The PC1512 shipped with 512 KB of RAM; it could be upgraded to 640 KB of RAM with 16 pieces of 4164-120 Dynamic RAM chips (64KBx1 per chip) and setting a jumper. Video output was compatible with the CGA standard, with an extension allowing all 16 colours to be used in the 640×200 graphics mode. The CPU of both the PC1512 and the later PC1640 was an 8 MHz Intel 8086, which was sufficient for playing &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; and &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;. The power supply was located in the monitor, which made upgrading difficult. 

The input devices supplied with the machine were notable. The mouse was an Amstrad Mouse, which was incompatible with serial mice common at the time. It was supported by some games, including &quot;Elite&quot;, but many DOS programs had problems with it. The keyboard sported an Atari-compatible joystick port for digital joysticks. Joystick movements and buttons were mapped to unused keyboard codes, allowing the joystick to be used in many DOS games that were written for keyboard control.

The series was somewhat unusual for the fact that it had a physical volume control on the internal speaker. This allowed the user to make the machine beep quietly, or silently, from boot time onwards. This innovation is still not present in most modern PCs: the legacy beeper is typically still a fixed-volume device.

<text>William King (1 May 1650 – 8 May 1729) was an Anglican divine in the Church of Ireland, who was Archbishop of Dublin from 1703 to 1729. He was an author and supported the Glorious Revolution. He had considerable political influence in Ireland, including an effective veto on judicial appointments.

==Early life==
King was born in May 1650 in County Antrim, to James King and his wife; his parents were recent immigrants from Aberdeen. He was educated at The Royal School, Dungannon, County Tyrone, and thereafter at Trinity College Dublin, graduating BA on 23 February 1670 and MA in 1673.

==Career==
On 25 October 1671, King was ordained a deacon as chaplain to John Parker, Archbishop of Tuam, and on 14 July 1673 Parker gave him the prebend of Kilmainmore, County Mayo. King, who lived as part of Parker&#x27;s household, was ordained a priest on 12 April 1674.

His support of the Glorious Revolution in 1688 served to advance his position. He became Bishop of Derry in 1691. He was advanced to the position of Archbishop of Dublin in 1703, a post he would hold until his death. He gave £1,000 for the founding of &quot;Archbishop King&#x27;s Professorship of Divinity&quot; at Trinity College in 1718. Much of his correspondence survives and provides a historic resource for the study of the Ireland of his time. He died in May 1729.

King&#x27;s years as a bishop were marked by reform and the building of churches and glebe houses, and by the dispensing of charity. He was generally regarded as a man of sense and good judgment, and his political influence was considerable: he was always consulted on judicial appointments and at times seems to have had an effective veto over candidates he considered unsuitable. His influence declined after the appointment of Hugh Boulter as Archbishop of Armagh in 1724, as Boulter was also consulted on judicial appointments, and the two could rarely agree on a suitable candidate.

Boulter&#x27;s preferment to the See of Armagh, passing over his own more obvious claims, was a bitter disappointment to King. He took petty revenge at their first meeting by refusing to get up from his chair, saying that he was too old to stand; he might reasonably have pointed out instead that he was a martyr to gout, from which he had suffered for forty years and from which he died five 
years later. He was a vocal opponent of Wood&#x27;s halfpence during the 1720s.

After King&#x27;s death, Bishop Theophilus Bolton purchased 6,000 of King&#x27;s books to establish the Bolton Library in Cashel, County Tipperary.

==Philosophical works==
As a man of letters and philosopher, he wrote &quot;The State of the Protestants in Ireland under King James&#x27;s Government&quot; in 1691 and &quot;De Origine Mali&quot; in 1702. The latter book was translated into English with extensive notes by Edmund Law in 1731 as &quot;An Essay on the Origin of Evil&quot;. It was also subject to discussion by Pierre Bayle as well as an influential critical discussion by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, published as an appendix to Leibniz&#x27;s &quot;Théodicée&quot;.

&quot;De Origine Mali&quot; contains a provocative and original philosophical account of free will that has recently started to attract philosophers&#x27; attention. In the context of the debate on free will, King argues that human beings, like God, are endowed with a distinctive faculty of free choice (&quot;electio&quot; in Latin). This faculty, criticized by Leibniz as an unfounded magical power (&quot;puissance magique&quot;), can, for King, generate value in the world. Recently, scholars have been debating the details of the process that leads to the generation of value through choice in King&#x27;s philosophy. While some argue that there is a lacuna in King&#x27;s explanation between election and action, others claim that King gives an account of how desires can provide such a connection.

<doc id="467593" wikidata="Q31292" url="?curid=467593" title="Sam Spiegel">
<text>Samuel P. Spiegel (November 11, 1901December 31, 1985) was an American independent film producer. Financially responsible for some of the most critically acclaimed motion pictures of the 20th century, Spiegel produced films that won the Academy Award for Best Picture three times, a Hollywood first for a sole independent producer.

== Early life ==
Spiegel was born to a German-speaking Jewish family in Jarosław, Galicia, Austria-Hungary (later modern Poland). His parents were Regina and Simon Spiegel, a tobacco wholesaler. He received his education at the University of Vienna. He had an older brother, Shalom Spiegel (1899-c. 1984), who was a professor of medieval Hebrew poetry.

== Career ==
Spiegel worked briefly in Hollywood in 1927 following a stint serving with Hashomer Hatzair in Mandatory Palestine. He then went to Berlin to produce German and French adaptations of Universal films. In 1933 he fled Germany following the election of the Nazi party and increased antisemitism. As an independent producer, Spiegel helped produce a number of European films.

In 1938, he emigrated to Mexico and subsequently the United States.

Between 1935 and 1954, Spiegel billed himself as S. P. Eagle; after that he used his real name. His nickname was the &quot;velvet octopus&quot; after his propensity to entwine himself with women in the back of taxis and manage Hollywood with a velvet touch according to Billy Wilder. He loved London and admired the British, as is reflected in his films &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957) and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), both of which won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture. Starting with the 1951 film &quot;The African Queen&quot;, he produced films through his British-based production company Horizon Pictures.

In a review in &quot;Variety&quot; of Natasha Fraser-Cavassoni&#x27;s biography of Spiegel, Wendy Smith notes: &quot;It&#x27;s all here: the sleazy financial maneuvers and creepy taste for underage girls that make Spiegel a decidedly flawed protagonist, as well as the wit, sophistication, and Old World charm that make him a titanic figure the likes of which the movie industry will not see again.&quot;

== Awards ==
Spiegel won the Academy Award for Best Picture for Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; as well as for &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957) and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), both directed by Briton David Lean. In 1963, he was awarded the Irving Thalberg Memorial Award at that year&#x27;s Academy Awards for his many contributions to cinema.

== Sexual misconduct allegations ==
American actress Theresa Russell alleged that she was sexually propositioned by Spiegel during her first casting session for his 1976 film &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;. In another interview, Russell recalled: &quot;I was 16 years old and still living at home, and he took me to the Bistro and tried to stick his tongue down my throat.&quot; After she refused to sign a contract with Spiegel, Russell &quot;was completely left out of the publicity for &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;, and Spiegel threatened that he would prevent Russell from working again in Hollywood. He also sexually harassed actress Toni Kalem when she worked as his secretary in 1975.

== Personal life ==
Spiegel was married three times: to Rachel Agronovich from 1922 to 1926, with whom he had one daughter; to the actress Lynn Baggett, from 1948 to 1953, and to Betty Benson (1930-2013), from 1957 until his death. He also had a son by Ann Pennington.

Spiegel maintained a connection with Israel throughout his life, particularly with such personalities as Golda Meir, Ariel Sharon, Jerusalem Foundation president Ruth Cheshin (wife of Mishael Cheshin), and his close friend, then Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek. Spiegel also contributed to various Zionist causes. He spoke eight languages fluently: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Hebrew and Yiddish.

== Legacy ==
Spiegel&#x27;s heirs and the administrators of his estate, son Adam Spiegel, daughter Alisa Freedman, niece Judge Raya Dreben, and Adv. David Bottoms, decided to transfer Spiegel&#x27;s impressive art collection to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Since 1996, they have made an annual contribution, through the Jerusalem Foundation, to the film school in Jerusalem bearing his name since that time – the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School, Jerusalem. This annual contribution is the largest in the history of Israeli cinema. 

In 2005, the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School, the Jerusalem Municipality complied with a request from the school&#x27;s founder-director Renen Schorr to mark the occasion by declaring the lane in the Talpiot industrial section where the school is located &quot;The Sam Spiegel Alley.&quot; The street sign&#x27;s inscription: &quot;Sam Spiegel – Jewish-American Film Producer and Oscar-winner. Pioneer. Lover of Zion.&quot;

<doc id="467604" wikidata="Q5101084" url="?curid=467604" title="Chink">
<text>Chink is an English-language ethnic slur usually referring to a person of Chinese descent, but also used to insult people with East Asian features. The use of the term describing eyes with epicanthic folds is considered highly offensive and is regarded as racist by many.

== Etymology ==
Various dictionaries provide different etymologies of the word &quot;chink&quot;; for example, that it originated from the Chinese courtesy &quot;ching-ching&quot;, that it evolved from the word &quot;China&quot;, or that it was an alteration of &quot;Qing&quot; (&quot;Ch&#x27;ing&quot;), as in the Qing dynasty.

Another possible origin is that &quot;chink&quot; evolved from the word for China in an Indo-Iranian language, ultimately deriving from the name of the Qing dynasty. That word is now pronounced similarly in various Indo-European languages.

== History ==
The first recorded use of the word &quot;chink&quot; is from approximately 1880. As far as is ascertainable, its adjective form, &quot;chinky&quot;, first appeared in print in 1878.

Around the turn of the 20th century, many white Americans in the Northern United States perceived Chinese immigration as a threat to their living standards. However, Chinese workers were still desired in the Western United States due to persistent labor shortages. Chinese butcher crews were held in such high esteem that when Edmund A. Smith patented his mechanized fish-butchering machine in 1905, he named it the &quot;Iron Chink&quot; which is seen by some as symbolic of anti-Chinese racism during the era. Usage of the word continued, such as with the story &quot;The Chink and the Child&quot;, by Thomas Burke, which was later adapted to film by D. W. Griffith. Griffith altered the story to be more racially sensitive and renamed it &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot;.

Although &quot;chink&quot; refers to those appearing to be of Chinese descent, the term has also been directed towards people of other East and Southeast Asian ethnicities. Literature and film about the Vietnam war contain examples of this usage, including the film &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986) and the play &quot;Sticks and Bones&quot; (1971, also later filmed).

== Worldwide usage==
=== Australia ===
The terms Chinaman and &quot;chink&quot; became intertwined, as some Australians used both with hostile intent when referring to members of the country&#x27;s Chinese population, which had swelled significantly during the Gold Rush era of the 1850s and 1860s.

Assaults on Chinese miners and racially motivated riots and public disturbances were not infrequent occurrences in Australia&#x27;s mining districts in the second half of the 19th century. There was some resentment, too, of the fact that Chinese miners and laborers tended to send their earnings back home to their families in China rather than spending them in Australia and supporting the local economy.

In the popular Sydney &quot;Bulletin&quot; magazine in 1887, one author wrote: &quot;No nigger, no chink, no lascar, no kanaka (laborer from the South Pacific islands), no purveyor of cheap labour, is an Australian.&quot; Eventually, since-repealed federal government legislation was passed to restrict non-white immigration and thus protect the jobs of Anglo-Celtic Australian workers from &quot;undesirable&quot; competition.

=== India ===
In India, the ethnic slur &quot;chinki&quot; (or &quot;chinky&quot;) is frequently directed against people with East Asian features, including people from Northeast India, and Nepal, who are often mistaken for Chinese, despite being closer to Tibetans and the Burmese than to Han Chinese peoples.

In 2012, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs recognized use of the term &quot;chinki&quot; to refer to a member of the Scheduled Tribes (especially in the North-East) as a criminal offense under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act with a penalty of up to five years in jail. The Ministry further warned that they would very seriously review any failure of the police to enforce this interpretation of the Act.

=== United Kingdom ===
&quot;Chinky&quot; (or &quot;chinky chonky&quot;) is a slur for a Chinese takeaway restaurant or Chinese food and Chinese people which, in parts of northern England, are known as a &quot;chinkies&quot;, always in the plural. 

The 1969 top 3 UK hit single for Blue Mink, &quot;Melting Pot&quot;, has the lyric: &quot;take a pinch of white man/Wrap him up in black skin. [...] Mixed with yellow Chinkees. You know you lump it all together/And you got a recipe for a get-along scene/Oh what a beautiful dream/If it could only come true&quot;. In August 2019, British broadcaster Global permanently deleted the song from its Gold playlist after a complaint about offensive language was lodged with British broadcasting regulator Ofcom. Under the direction of the Communications Act 2003, Ofcom ruled that &quot;the phrase &#x27;yellow Chinkies&#x27; had the potential to be highly offensive&quot; and &quot;that the use of derogatory language to describe ethnic groups carries a widespread potential for offence&quot;. Ofcom considered that the passage of time since the song&#x27;s release and the song&#x27;s positive message of racial harmony did not &quot;mitigate the potential for offence.&quot; Ofcom determined that the &quot;potentially offensive material was not justified by the context&quot; and ruled the case resolved as the licensee Global had removed the song from Gold&#x27;s playlist. In September 2019, Scottish community radio station Black Diamond FM removed &quot;Melting Pot&quot; from its playlist and &quot;planned to carry out refresher training with its staff&quot; after two complaints about the song&#x27;s broadcast were lodged with Ofcom. Ofcom ruled in December 2019 that Black Diamond was in breach of Ofcom&#x27;s Broadcasting Code because &quot;the potentially offensive language in this broadcast was not justified by the context&quot;.

In 1999, an exam given to students in Scotland was criticized for containing a passage that students were told to interpret containing the word &quot;chinky&quot;. This exam was taken by students all over Scotland, and Chinese groups expressed offence at the use of this passage. The examinations body apologized, calling the passage&#x27;s inclusion &quot;an error of judgement.&quot;

In 2002, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, after a complaint about the BBC One programme &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;, held that when used as the name of a type of restaurant or meal, rather than as an adjective applied to a person or group of people, the word still carries extreme racist connotation which causes offence particularly to those of East Asian origin.

In 2004, the commission&#x27;s counterpart, the Radio Authority, apologised for the offence caused by an incident where a DJ on Heart 106.2 used the term.

In a 2005 document commissioned by Ofcom titled &quot;Language and Sexual Imagery in Broadcasting: A Contextual Investigation&quot; their definition of chink was &quot;a term of racial offence/abuse. However, this is polarising. Older and mainly white groups tend to think this is not usually used in an abusive way—e.g., let&#x27;s go to the Chinky—which is not seen as offensive by those who aren&#x27;t of East Asian origin; Chinky usually refers to food not a culture or race however, younger people, East Asians, particularly people of Chinese origin and other non-white ethnic minorities believe the word &#x27;Chinky, Chinkies or Chinkie&#x27; to be as insulting as &#x27;paki&#x27; or &#x27;nigger&#x27;.&quot;

In 2006, after several campaigns by the Scottish Executive, more people in Scotland now acknowledge that this name is indirectly racist. , British broadcasting regulator Ofcom considers the word to be &quot;Strongest language, highly unacceptable without strong contextualisation. Seen as derogatory to Chinese people. More mixed views regarding use of the term to mean &#x27;Chinese takeaway&#x27;&quot;.

In 2014, the term gained renewed attention after a recording emerged of UKIP candidate Kerry Smith referring to a woman of Chinese background as a &quot;chinky bird&quot;.

=== United States ===
The Pekin Community High School District 303 teams in Pekin, Illinois were officially known as the &quot;Pekin Chinks&quot; until 1981, when the school administration changed the name to the &quot;Pekin Dragons&quot;. The event received national attention.

During early 2000, University of California, Davis experienced a string of racial incidents and crimes between Asian and white students, mostly among fraternities. Several incidents included &quot;chink&quot; and other racial epithets being shouted among groups, including the slurs being used during a robbery and assault on an Asian fraternity by 15 white males. The incidents motivated a school-wide review and protest to get professional conflict resolution and culturally sensitive mediators.

Sarah Silverman appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in 2001, stirring up controversy when the word &quot;chink&quot; was used without the usual bleep appearing over ethnic slurs on network television. The controversy led Asian activist and community leader Guy Aoki to appear on the talk show &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; along with Sarah Silverman. Guy Aoki alleged that Silverman did not believe that the term was offensive.

New York City radio station Hot 97 was criticized for airing the &quot;Tsunami Song&quot;. Referring to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, in which over an estimated 200,000 people died, the song used the phrase &quot;screaming chinks&quot; along with other offensive lyrics. The radio station fired a co-host and producer, and indefinitely suspended radio personality Miss Jones, who was later reinstated. Members of the Asian American community said Miss Jones&#x27; reinstatement condoned hate speech.

A Philadelphia eatery, Chink&#x27;s Steaks, created controversy beginning in 2004 with articles appearing in the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; and other newspapers. The restaurant was asked by Asian community groups to change the name. The restaurant was named after the original Jewish-American owner&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Chink&quot;, derived from the ethnic slur due to his &quot;slanty eyes&quot;. The restaurant was renamed Joe&#x27;s in 2013.

In February 2012, ESPN fired one employee and suspended another for using the headline &quot;Chink in the Armor&quot; in reference to Jeremy Lin, an American basketball player of Taiwanese and Chinese descent. While the word &quot;&quot; also refers to a crack or fissure and &quot;chink in the armor&quot; is an idiom and common sports cliché, referring to a vulnerability, the &quot;apparently intentional&quot; double entendre of its use in reference to an Asian athlete was viewed as offensive.

In September 2019, after it was announced that Shane Gillis would be joining &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a featured cast member, clips from Gillis&#x27; podcast in 2018 resurfaced, in which Gillis made anti-Asian jokes, including using the word &quot;chink&quot;. The revelation sparked public outcry, with several outlets noting the disconnect of hiring Gillis along with Bowen Yang, the show&#x27;s first Chinese American cast member. After Gillis issued what was characterized as a non-apology apology, a spokesperson for Lorne Michaels announced Gillis would be let go prior to his first episode due to the controversy.

In May 2021, American comedian Tony Hinchcliffe was videotaped insulting Peng Dang, an Asian American comedian who had introduced Hinchcliffe after performing the previous set at a comedy club in Austin, Texas, by referring to Dang as a &quot;filthy little fucking chink&quot;. Dang posted the video on Twitter, resulting in heavy backlash against Hinchliffe, who was subsequently dropped by his agency and removed from several scheduled shows.

<text>Earl of Wharncliffe, in the West Riding of the County of York, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==History==
The earldom was created in 1876 for Edward Montagu-Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, 3rd Baron Wharncliffe. He was a descendant of Edward Wortley Montagu (grandson of Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich), and his wife, the author Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Their daughter Mary married the future Prime Minister John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute. Their second son, James Stuart, succeeded to the Wortley estates in Yorkshire and Cornwall through his mother and assumed the additional surname of Wortley, becoming James Stuart-Wortley. In 1803, he also inherited the Scottish estates of his uncle James Stuart-Mackenzie and assumed the additional surname of Mackenzie. His second son, James Stuart-Wortley, was a soldier and prominent Tory politician. In 1826, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Wharncliffe, of Wortley in the County of York.

The first baron was succeeded by his eldest son, John. He represented Bossiney, Perth, and the West Riding of Yorkshire in the House of Commons. On his death, the peerage passed to his eldest son, Edward, the third Baron. He was Chairman of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, which under his leadership became the Great Central Railway. In 1876 he was created Viscount Carlton, of Carlton in the West Riding of the County of York, and Earl of Wharncliffe, in the West Riding of the County of York, with remainder to his younger brother the Hon. Francis Dudley Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie (1829–1893). These titles are all in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1880, Lord Wharncliffe assumed the additional surname of Montagu. He was succeeded in the viscountcy and earldom, by virtue of the special remainder, by his nephew Francis, the second Earl, the eldest son of the Hon. Francis Dudley Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie. This line of the family failed on the death of his grandson, the fourth Earl, in 1987. He was succeeded by a second cousin once removed, the fifth and present Earl, Richard Alan Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, of Portland, Maine, the elder son of Alan Ralph Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, only son of Ralph Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, only son of the Hon. Ralph Granville Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, younger brother of the second Earl.

==Other notable family members==
Several other members of this branch of the Stuart family have also gained distinction. John Stuart-Wortley, younger brother of the first Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Bossiney. The Hon. Charles Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, second son of the first Baron, was also Member of Parliament for Bossiney. His daughter Victoria, Lady Welby, was a philosopher of language. Charles Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Stuart of Wortley, was the son of the Hon. James Stuart-Wortley, third son of the first Baron (see the Baron Stuart of Wortley for more information on this branch of the family). The Hon. Edward James Montague-Stuart-Wortley (1857–1934), second son of the Hon. Francis, second son of the second Baron, was a Major-General in the British Army. The Hon. Sir (Alan) Richard Montagu-Stuart-Wortley (1868–1949), younger son of the Hon. Francis, second son of the second Baron, was a Lieutenant-General in the British Army. The Hon. James Stuart-Wortley, third son of the second Baron, was a member of the first Parliament of New Zealand.

==Family seat==

Until the Second World War, the family seat was Wortley Hall. In 1950, it was sold by the third Earl. He kept ownership of the estate and built a new family seat, Wharncliffe House, about a mile south of Wortley, South Yorkshire, considerably smaller than the old one, with only five bedrooms, sitting in woodland on the estate. The fourth Earl continued to live there until his death.

==Present peer==
Richard Alan Montagu Stuart Wortley, 5th Earl of Wharncliffe (born 1953), is an American distant cousin of the fourth Earl, a grandson of Ralph Granville Montagu-Stuart-Wortley (1864–1927), a younger brother of the second earl, and succeeded to the peerages in 1987. At the time, he was a construction foreman from Cumberland, Maine. The fourth Earl separated the peerages from what was left of the estate, leaving it to his immediate family. In July 1987, the new peer arrived in Yorkshire as a tourist, to visit the family seat, which he had never seen. He commented “I am just an ordinary guy.” The estate was ultimately inherited by Lady Rowena Wortley-Hunt, only surviving child of the fourth earl, who took it over on her mother’s death in 2001.

The heir apparent to the peerages is the present holder&#x27;s eldest son, Reed Montagu Stuart Wortley, Viscount Carlton (born 1980).

<doc id="467608" wikidata="Q5326394" url="?curid=467608" title="Earl of Yarborough">
<text>Earl of Yarborough is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1837 for Charles Anderson-Pelham, 2nd Baron Yarborough.

==History==

The Anderson-Pelham family descends from Francis Anderson of Manby, Lincolnshire. He married Mary, daughter of Charles Pelham of Brocklesby, Lincolnshire. Their grandson Charles Anderson assumed the additional surname of Pelham and represented Beverley and Lincolnshire in the House of Commons. In 1794 he was created Baron Yarborough, of Yarborough in the County of Lincoln, in the Peerage of Great Britain.

He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He sat as Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby and for Lincolnshire. Lord Yarborough married Henrietta Anne Maria Charlotte Bridgeman Simpson (d. 1813), daughter of John Simpson and Henrietta Francis Worsley, daughter of Sir Thomas Worsley, 6th Baronet, of Appuldurcombe (a title which became extinct in 1825; see Worsley baronets). Through this marriage Appuldurcombe House on the Isle of Wight, which had previously been in the Worsley family, came into the Anderson-Pelham family
 (however, it was sold in 1855). In 1837 Yarborough was created Baron Worsley, of Appuldurcombe on the Isle of Wight, and Earl of Yarborough, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He represented Newport, Isle of Wight, Lincolnshire and North Lincolnshire in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. Lord Yarborough is also remembered for giving his name to the bridge term the &quot;Yarborough hand&quot;. His son, the third Earl, was Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby.

On his early death the titles passed to his son, the fourth Earl. He held office in the second Conservative administration of Lord Salisbury as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms from 1890 to 1892 and was also Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. In 1905 he assumed by Royal licence for himself and issue the surname and arms of Pelham only in 1905. Lord Yarborough married Marcia Lane-Fox, daughter of Sackville George Lane-Fox, 15th Baron Darcy de Knayth and 12th Baron Conyers. The baronies of Darcy de Knayth and Conyers fell into abeyance on the latter&#x27;s death in 1888. However, in 1892 the barony of Conyers was called out of abeyance in favour of Marcia, who became the thirteenth Baron Conyers in her own right. In 1903 the ancient barony of Fauconberg, which had been in abeyance since 1463, was also called out in her favour and she became the seventh Baroness Fauconberg as well.

Both Lord and Lady Yarborough were succeeded in their respective titles by their second but eldest surviving son, the fifth Earl. He had no sons and on his death in 1948 the baronies of Conyers and Fauconberg fell into abeyance between his two daughters Lady Diana Mary and Lady June Wendy; they remained so until the death of Lady June Wendy in 2012. He was succeeded in the other titles by his younger brother, the sixth Earl. As of 2009 the peerages are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the eighth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1991.

Caistor Yarborough School in Caistor, Lincolnshire was named in memorial to John Edward Pelham, 7th Earl of Yarborough and is located less than a mile away from the Brocklesby House estate. A number of public places, roads and buildings in Lincolnshire are named after the Yarborough title, particularly in Grimsby, where the family were particularly prominent political figures. One of the most well known sites is the Yarborough Hotel, built in 1851 and now a pub owned by J. D. Wetherspoon. There was also an area in Grimsby called Yarborough, until it was absorbed into the conurbation of Grimsby &amp; Cleethorpes and there continues to be a Yarborough Estate in the town, which is currently undergoing extensive re-development.

Another member of this family was Sir Stephen Anderson, 1st Baronet, of Eyworth. He was the brother of Francis Anderson, grandfather of the first Baron Yarborough. Dudley Pelham, younger son of the first Earl, was a naval commander and politician.

The family crest has been adopted by HMS &quot;Brocklesby&quot;, which is named after the Brocklesby Hunt.

The Yarborough Monument on Bembridge Down commissioned by the Royal Yacht Squadron commemorates his life and is both a sea mark and the highest monument on the Isle of Wight at 75 ft.

The family seat is Brocklesby Hall, near Immingham, Lincolnshire.

<doc id="467609" wikidata="Q537498" url="?curid=467609" title="Vito Genovese">
<text>Vito Genovese (; November 21, 1897 – February 14, 1969) was an Italian-born American &quot;mafioso&quot; and the leader of the Genovese crime family in New York City. A childhood friend and criminal associate of Lucky Luciano, Genovese took part in the Castellammarese War and helped Luciano shape the Mafia&#x27;s rise as a major force in organized crime in the United States. He would later lead Luciano&#x27;s crime family, which was renamed by the FBI after Genovese in 1957.

Along with Luciano, Genovese facilitated the expansion of the heroin trade to an international level. He fled to Italy in 1937, and for a brief period during World War II he supported Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist regime for fear of being deported back to the U.S. to face murder charges. After returning to the U.S. in 1945, Genovese served as mentor to Vincent &quot;the Chin&quot; Gigante, the future boss of the Genovese family.

In 1957, Genovese vied for the title of &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; (boss of bosses) by ordering the murder of Albert Anastasia and the botched hit of Frank Costello. Immediately following this, he called a mafia summit to consolidate his power, but the meeting was raided by police. In 1959, Genovese&#x27;s reign was cut short as he was convicted on narcotics conspiracy charges and sentenced to fifteen years in prison. While he and his underling Joe Valachi were in prison together, Valachi killed an inmate he thought to be a hitman sent by Genovese. Valachi then became a government witness. Genovese died in prison on February 14, 1969.

== Early life ==
Vito Genovese was born on November 21, 1897, in Risigliano, a &quot;frazione&quot; in the &quot;comune&quot; of Tufino, in the Province of Naples, Italy. His father was Frances Felice Genovese and his mother Nunziata Aluotto. Vito had a sister, Giovanna Jennie (m. Ricciotto Prisco), along with two brothers, Michael and Carmine, who later joined Genovese&#x27;s crime family. His cousin, Michael, became boss of the Pittsburgh crime family.

As a child in Italy, Genovese completed school only to the American equivalent of the fifth grade. In 1913, when Genovese was aged 15, his family immigrated to the United States onboard the SS &quot;Taormina&quot; and took up residence in New York City&#x27;s Little Italy.

Genovese was Until 1934, Genovese lived in New York City. In 1935, looking for a place where his family could be &quot;out in the country&quot;, Genovese purchased a mansion in rural Middletown Township, New Jersey. The mansion&#x27;s grounds were extensively landscaped into Italian gardens evoking Genovese&#x27;s homeland, and included a small rock replica of Mount Vesuvius. Today, it is the site a public botanical gardens called Deep Cut Gardens. 

In 1937 while Genovese was in Italy due to the Boccia murder, the mansion burnt down and was never rebuilt. After the mansions&#x27; destruction, he and his family lived a quiet life in a house in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey.

== Criminal career ==
Genovese started his criminal career stealing merchandise from pushcart vendors and running errands for mobsters. He later collected money from people who played illegal lotteries. At 19, Genovese spent a year in prison for illegal possession of a firearm.

By the 1920s, Genovese started working for Giuseppe &quot;Joe the Boss&quot; Masseria, the boss of a powerful Manhattan gang that would evolve into the family he would eventually lead. Charlie Luciano and his close associates started working for gambler Arnold &quot;The Brain&quot; Rothstein, who immediately saw the potential windfall from Prohibition and educated Luciano on running bootleg alcohol as a business. Luciano, Frank Costello, and Genovese started their own bootlegging operation with financing from Rothstein.

In 1930, Genovese was indicted on counterfeiting charges when police found $1 million of counterfeit US currency in a Bath Beach, Brooklyn, workshop. Later in 1930, Genovese allegedly murdered Gaetano Reina, the leader of a Bronx-based gang. Reina had been a Masseria ally, but Masseria decided to kill him after he began to suspect him of secretly helping Masseria&#x27;s archrival, Brooklyn gang leader Salvatore Maranzano. On February 26, 1930, Genovese allegedly ambushed Reina as he was leaving his mistress&#x27;s house in the Bronx and shot him in the back of the head with a shotgun. Masseria then took direct control of the Reina gang.

=== Castellammarese War ===
In early 1930, the Castellammarese War broke out between Masseria and Maranzano. In a secret deal with Maranzano, Luciano agreed to engineer the death of his boss, Masseria, in return for receiving Masseria&#x27;s rackets and becoming Maranzano&#x27;s second-in-command. On April 15, 1931, Luciano had lured Masseria to a meeting where he was murdered at a restaurant called Nuova Villa Tammaro on Coney Island. While they played cards, Luciano allegedly excused himself to the bathroom, with the gunmen reportedly being Genovese, Albert Anastasia, Joe Adonis, and Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel; Ciro &quot;The Artichoke King&quot; Terranova drove the getaway car, but legend has it that he was too shaken up to drive away and had to be shoved out of the driver&#x27;s seat by Siegel. Luciano took over Masseria&#x27;s family, with Genovese as his underboss.

In September 1931, Luciano and Genovese planned the murder of Salvatore Maranzano. Luciano had received word that Maranzano was planning to kill him and Genovese, and prepared a hit team to kill Maranzano first. On September 10, 1931, when Maranzano summoned Luciano, Genovese, and Frank Costello to a meeting at his office, they knew Maranzano would kill them there. Instead, Luciano sent to Maranzano&#x27;s office four Jewish gangsters whose faces were unknown to Maranzano&#x27;s people. They had been secured with the aid of Meyer Lansky and Siegel. Luciano subsequently created The Commission to serve as the governing body for organized crime.

In 1931, Genovese&#x27;s first wife, Donata Ragone, died of tuberculosis and he quickly announced his intention to marry Anna Petillo, who was already married to Gerard Vernotico.

On March 16, 1932, Vernotico was found strangled to death on a Manhattan rooftop, and on March 28, 1932, Genovese married his widow, Anna, who was Genovese&#x27;s cousin via her mother, Concetta y Cassini Genovese.

=== Boccia murder and flight to Italy ===

In 1934, Genovese allegedly ordered the murder of mobster Ferdinand Boccia. Genovese and Boccia had conspired to cheat a wealthy gambler out of $150,000 in a high-stakes card game. After the game, Boccia demanded a share of $35,000 because he had introduced the victim to Genovese. Rather than pay Boccia anything, Genovese decided to have him murdered. On September 19, 1934, Genovese and five associates allegedly shot and killed Boccia in a coffee shop in Brooklyn.

On June 18, 1936, Luciano was sentenced to 30 to 50 years in prison as a result of his conviction on pandering. With Luciano&#x27;s imprisonment, Genovese became acting boss of the Luciano crime family.

On November 25, 1936, Genovese became a naturalized United States citizen in New York City. In 1937, fearing prosecution for the Boccia murder, Genovese fled to Italy with $750,000 cash and settled in the city of Nola, near Naples. With Genovese&#x27;s departure, Costello became acting boss.

After bribing some fascist party members, Genovese became a friend of Galeazzo Ciano, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s son-in-law; it is believed Genovese provided Ciano with cocaine. Genovese donated nearly $4 million to Mussolini&#x27;s fascist party by the end of World War II. He was also awarded the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus and made a &quot;commendatore&quot;, after he participated in helping create a new fascist party headquarters in Nola.

In 1943, Genovese allegedly ordered the murder of Carlo Tresca, the publisher of an anarchist newspaper in New York and an enemy of Mussolini. Genovese allegedly facilitated the murder as a favor to the Italian government. On January 11, 1943, a gunman shot and killed Tresca outside his newspaper office in Manhattan. The shooter was later alleged to be Carmine Galante, a member of the Bonanno crime family. No one was ever charged in the Tresca murder.

=== Return to New York ===
When the Allies invaded Italy in September 1943, Genovese switched sides and quickly offered his services to the U.S. Army. Former New York governor Charles Poletti, then attached to the U.S. Army, accepted a 1938 Packard Sedan as a personal gift from Genovese. Genovese was appointed to a position of interpreter/liaison officer in the U.S. Army headquarters in Naples and quickly became one of Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories&#x27; (AMGOT) most trusted employees. Poletti and the entire AMGOT department were completely unaware of his history.

Genovese established one of the largest black market operations in southern Italy, together with the Cosa Nostra&#x27;s boss Calogero Vizzini. Vizzini sent truck caravans loaded with all the basic food commodities necessary for the Italian diet rolling northward to hungry Naples, where their cargoes were distributed by Genovese&#x27;s organization. All of the trucks were issued passes and export papers by the AMGOT administration in Naples and Sicily, and some corrupt American army officers even made contributions of gasoline and trucks to the operation. According to Luke Monzelli, a lieutenant in the Carabinieri assigned to follow Genovese during his time in Italy: &quot;Truckloads of food supplies were shipped from Vizzini to Genovese — all accompanied by the proper documents which had been certified by men in authority, Mafia members in the service of Vizzini and Genovese.&quot;

In the summer of 1944 in New York, Genovese was implicated in the Boccia murder by mobster Ernest &quot;The Hawk&quot; Rupolo, a former Genovese associate. Facing a murder conviction, Rupolo had decided to become a government witness.

On August 27, 1944, U.S. military police arrested Genovese in Italy during an investigation into his running of a black market ring. It was revealed that Genovese had been stealing trucks, flour, and sugar from the Army. When Agent Orange C. Dickey of the Criminal Investigation Division examined Genovese&#x27;s background, he discovered that Genovese was a fugitive wanted for the 1934 Boccia killing. However, there was seemingly little interest from the Army or the federal government in pursuing Genovese.

After months of frustration, Dickey was finally able to make preparations to ship Genovese back to New York to face trial, but came under increasing pressure. Genovese personally offered Dickey a $250,000 bribe to release him, then threatened Dickey when the offer was refused. Dickey was even instructed by his superiors in the military chain of command to refrain from pursuing Genovese, but refused to be dissuaded.

On June 2, 1945, after arriving in New York by ship the day before, Genovese was arraigned on murder charges for the 1934 Boccia killing. He pleaded not guilty. On June 10, 1946, another prosecution witness, Jerry Esposito, was found shot to death beside a road in Norwood, New Jersey. Earlier, another witness, Peter LaTempa, was found dead in a cell where he had been held in protective custody.

Without anyone to corroborate Rupolo&#x27;s testimony, the government&#x27;s case collapsed, and the charges against Genovese were dismissed on June 10, 1946. In making his decision, Judge Samuel Leibowitz commented:

I cannot speak for the jury, but I believe that if there were even a shred of corroborating evidence, you would have been condemned to the (electric) chair. 

=== Pursuit of power ===
With his release from custody in 1946, Genovese was able to rejoin the Luciano family in New York; however, neither Costello nor his underboss Willie Moretti was willing to return power to him. In 1946, Lansky called a meeting of the heads of the major crime families in Havana that December. The three topics which would come under discussion were the heroin trade, Cuban gambling, and what to do about Bugsy Siegel and the floundering Flamingo Hotel project in Las Vegas. The conference took place at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba and lasted a little more than a week.

On December 20, during the conference, Luciano had a private meeting with Genovese in Luciano&#x27;s hotel suite. Unlike Costello, Luciano had never trusted Genovese. In the meeting, Genovese tried to convince Luciano to become a titular boss of bosses and let Genovese run everything. Luciano calmly rejected Genovese&#x27;s suggestion:

There is no Boss of Bosses. I turned it down in front of everybody. If I ever change my mind, I will take the title. But it won&#x27;t be up to you. Right now you work for me and I ain&#x27;t in the mood to retire. Don&#x27;t you ever let me hear this again, or I&#x27;ll lose my temper.

Genovese was now a capo of his former Greenwich Village Crew. However, on October 4, 1951, Moretti was assassinated by order of the Mafia Commission; the mob bosses were unhappy with his testimony during the Kefauver Hearings, and were worried, with the syphilis now affecting his brain, he might start talking to the press. Costello appointed Genovese as the new underboss.

In December 1952, Anna Genovese sued her husband for financial support, and later divorce in 1953, as well as testifying to Vito&#x27;s involvement in criminal rackets, an unheard-of action by the wife of a mob figure. Two years earlier, she had moved out of the family home in New Jersey. She asked the judge for $350 per week. Vito filed a counter-suit for divorce on the grounds of desertion. According to Anna Genovese, Vito Genovese ruled the Italian lottery in New York and New Jersey, bringing in over $1 million per year, owned four Greenwich Village night clubs, a dog track in Virginia, and other legitimate businesses. Both claims were ultimately dismissed in the New Jersey Superior Court appellate division, in 1954. In 1953, Genovese allegedly ordered the murder of mobster Steven Franse. Genovese had tasked Franse with supervising Anna while he hid in Italy. Outraged over Anna&#x27;s potential love affairs and her lawsuit against him, Genovese ordered Joseph Valachi to set up Franse&#x27;s murder. On June 18, 1953, Valachi lured Franse to his restaurant in the Bronx, where Franse was strangled to death by Pasquale Pagano and Fiore Siano (Valachi&#x27;s nephew).

During the mid-1950s, Genovese decided to move against Costello. However, Genovese needed to also remove Costello&#x27;s strong ally on the Commission, Albert Anastasia, the boss of the Anastasia crime family. Genovese was soon conspiring with Carlo Gambino, Anastasia&#x27;s underboss, to remove Anastasia.

In early 1957, Genovese decided the time to move on Costello had come. Genovese ordered Vincent Gigante to murder Costello, and on May 2, 1957, Gigante shot and wounded Costello outside his apartment building. Although the wound was superficial, it persuaded Costello to relinquish power to Genovese and retire. A doorman identified Gigante as the gunman, however, in 1958, Costello testified that he was unable to recognize his assailant; Gigante was acquitted on charges of attempted murder. Genovese now became boss of what is known as the Genovese crime family and promoted his longtime lieutenant, Anthony Strollo, to underboss.

In late 1957, Genovese and Gambino allegedly ordered Anastasia&#x27;s murder. Genovese had heard rumors that Costello was conspiring with Anastasia to regain power. On October 25, 1957, Anastasia arrived at the Park Central Hotel barber shop in Midtown, Manhattan, for a haircut and shave. As Anastasia relaxed in the barber chair, two men with their faces covered in scarves shot and killed him. Witnesses were unable to identify any of the gunmen, and competing theories exist today as to their identities.

=== Apalachin meeting and prison ===
In November 1957, immediately after the Anastasia murder, after taking control of the Luciano crime family from Costello, Genovese wanted to legitimize his new power by holding a national Cosa Nostra meeting. Genovese selected Buffalo, New York boss and Commission member Stefano &quot;The Undertaker&quot; Magaddino to organize the meeting; he in turn chose northeastern Pennsylvania crime boss Joseph Barbara and his underboss Russell Bufalino to oversee all the arrangements for it. Cuba was one of the topics of discussion, particularly the gambling and narcotics smuggling interests of La Cosa Nostra on the island. The international narcotics trade was also an important topic on the agenda. The New York garment industry interests and rackets, such as loansharking to the business owners and control of garment center trucking, were other important topics on the agenda.

On November 14, 1957, powerful mafiosi from the United States and Italy convened at Barbara&#x27;s estate in Apalachin, New York. The meeting agenda included the resolution of open questions on illegal gambling and narcotics dealing, particularly in the New York City area. State trooper Edgar D. Croswell had become aware that Barbara&#x27;s son was reserving rooms in local hotels along with the delivery of a large quantity of meat from a local butcher to the Barbara home. That made Croswell suspicious, and he therefore decided to keep an eye on Barbara&#x27;s house. When the state police found many luxury cars parked at Barbara&#x27;s home they began taking down license plate numbers. Having found that many of these cars were registered to known criminals, state police reinforcements came to the scene and began to set up a roadblock. When the mobsters discovered the police presence, they started fleeing the gathering by car and by foot. Many Mafiosi escaped through the woods surrounding the Barbara estate. The police stopped a car driven by Bufalino, whose passengers included Genovese and three other men, at a roadblock as they left the estate; Bufalino said that he had come to visit his sick friend, Barbara. Genovese said he was just there for a barbecue and to discuss business with Barbara. The police let him go.

On June 2, 1958, Genovese testified under subpoena in the U.S. Senate McClellan Hearings on organized crime. Genovese refused to answer any questions, citing the Fifth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution 150 separate times.

Luciano allegedly helped pay part of $100,000 to a Puerto Rican drug dealer to falsely implicate Genovese in a drug deal. On July 7, 1958, Genovese was indicted on charges of conspiring to import and sell narcotics. The government&#x27;s star witness was Nelson Cantellops, a Puerto Rican drug dealer who claimed Genovese met with him. On April 4, 1959, Genovese was convicted in New York of conspiracy to violate federal narcotics laws. On April 17, 1959, Genovese was sentenced to 15 years in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta, where he tried to run his crime family from prison. In his book, &quot;Five Families,&quot; longtime &quot;New York Times&quot; organized-crime reporter Selwyn Raab wrote that a number of detectives, lawyers and organized crime experts have questioned the legitimacy of Genovese&#x27;s conviction. For instance, longtime NYPD detective Ralph Salerno argued that &quot;anyone who understands the protocol and insulation procedures&quot; of the Mafia would find it &quot;almost unbelievable&quot; that a crime boss would be directly involved in a drug operation.

In September 1959, Genovese allegedly ordered the murder of mobster Anthony Carfano. Angered at the murder attempt on Costello, Carfano had skipped the Apalachin meeting in protest. In response, Genovese decided to murder him. On September 25, 1959, Carfano and a female companion were found shot to death in his Cadillac automobile on a residential street in Jackson Heights, Queens.

In April 1962, Genovese allegedly ordered the murder of Anthony Strollo after concluding that Strollo was part of the plot that put him in prison. On April 8, Strollo left his house to go for a walk and was never seen again. His body was never recovered.

In 1962, an alleged murder threat from Genovese propelled mobster Joseph Valachi into the public spotlight. In June, Genovese supposedly accused Valachi, also imprisoned in Atlanta, of being an informer and gave Valachi the kiss of death. In July, Valachi supposedly mistook another inmate for a mob hitman and killed him. A $100,000 bounty for Valachi&#x27;s death had been placed by Genovese. After receiving a life sentence for that murder, Valachi decided to become a government witness.

On August 24, 1964, Ernest Rupolo&#x27;s body was recovered from Jamaica Bay, Queens. His killers had attached two concrete blocks to his legs and tied his hands. It was widely assumed that Genovese had ordered Rupolo&#x27;s murder for testifying against him in the 1944 Boccia murder trial.

<doc id="467620" wikidata="Q731953" url="?curid=467620" title="Standard German phonology">
<text>The phonology of Standard German is the standard pronunciation or accent of the German language. It deals with current phonology and phonetics as well as with historical developments thereof as well as the geographical variants and the influence of German dialects.

While the spelling of German is officially standardised by an international organisation (the Council for German Orthography) the pronunciation has no official standard and relies on a &quot;de facto&quot; standard documented in reference works such as (German Pronunciation Dictionary) by Eva-Maria Krech et al., (Duden volume 6, The Pronunciation Dictionary) by Max Mangold and the training materials of radio and television stations such as &quot;Westdeutscher Rundfunk&quot;, &quot;Deutschlandfunk&quot;, or &quot;Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen&quot;. This standardised pronunciation was invented, rather than coming from any particular German-speaking city. But the pronunciation that Germans usually consider to be closest to the standard is that of Hanover. Standard German is sometimes referred to as (stage German), but the latter has its own definition and is slightly different.

==Vowels==
===Monophthongs===
Some scholars treat as an unstressed allophone of . Likewise, some scholars treat as an allophone of the sequence or as a vocalic realization of syllabic . The phonemic status of is also debated – see below.

====Notes====
* Close vowels
** is close front unrounded .
** is close near-front rounded .
** is close back rounded .
** has been variously described as near-close front unrounded and near-close near-front unrounded .
** is near-close near-front rounded .
** is near-close near-back rounded .
* Mid vowels
** is close-mid front unrounded .
*** In non-standard accents of the Low German speaking area, as well as in some Bavarian and Austrian accents it may be pronounced as a narrow closing diphthong .
** has been variously described as close-mid near-front rounded and mid near-front rounded . One source shows it as considerably centralized on the vowel chart (the one shown above), closer to than cardinal .
*** In non-standard accents of the Low German speaking area, as well as in some Austrian accents it may be pronounced as a narrow closing diphthong .
** is close-mid back rounded .
*** In non-standard accents of the Low German speaking area, as well as in some Austrian accents it may be pronounced as a narrow closing diphthong .
** has been variously described as mid central unrounded . and close-mid central unrounded . It occurs only in unstressed syllables, for instance in (&#x27;occupy&#x27;). It is often considered a complementary allophone together with , which only rarely or regionally occurs in unstressed syllables (e.g. ). If a sonorant follows in the syllable coda, the schwa often disappears so that the sonorant becomes syllabic, for instance (&#x27;pillow&#x27;), (&#x27;donkey&#x27;). However, Standard German spoken in Luxembourg often lacks syllabic sonorants under the influence of Luxembourgish, so that e.g. (&#x27;put&#x27;) is pronounced , rather than .

** has been variously described as mid front unrounded and open-mid front unrounded .
** has been variously described as open-mid near-front rounded and somewhat lowered open-mid near-front rounded .

* Open vowels
** is near-open central unrounded . It is a common allophone of the sequence common to all German-speaking areas but Switzerland. As schwa /ə/ is never pronounced here, it also possible to interpret as the vocalic allophone of the syllabic sonorant /r̩/.
** has been variously described as open front unrounded and open central unrounded . Some scholars differentiate two short , namely front and back . The latter occurs only in unstressed open syllables, exactly as .
*** Standard Austrian pronunciation of this vowel is back .
*** Front or even is a common realization of in northern German varieties influenced by Low German.
** has been variously described as open central unrounded and open back unrounded . Because of this, it is sometimes transcribed .
*** Back is the Standard Austrian pronunciation. It is also a common realization of in northern German varieties influenced by Low German (in which it may even be rounded ).
** notes that &quot;there is a tendency to neutralize the distinction between , , and . That is, , , and have final syllables which are perceptually very similar, and are nearly or completely identical in some dialects.&quot; He also says that &quot;outside of a word context, cannot be distinguished from . (As early as 1847, Verdi&#x27;s librettist found it natural, when adapting a play by Schiller into the Italian language, to render the distinctly German name &quot;Roller&quot; as &quot;Rolla&quot;.)
** According to the 7th edition of &quot;Das Aussprachewörterbuch&quot;, the standard pronunciation differentiates from unstressed (which typically belongs to phoneme, see below). The authors claim that the difference is one of height: vs. . However, they tend to be neutralized in the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region towards an open central . Conversely, in southern Germany, is often realized as (in turn, Standard is often closer to ). In Franconia and partially also in the coastal regions of Germany, the vowel is closer to , whereas in west-central Germany it is slightly more open, that is . In each case but the first one, is strongly differentiated from . In regions without r-vocalization, the difference is always present.
** According to a 2020 study, is not distinguished from unstressed in Northern Standard German. Word pairs such as &#x27;opera&#x27; (traditionally transcribed ) and &#x27;grandpa&#x27; (traditionally transcribed ) are thus homophones (as ), rather than minimal pairs. The merged vowel has a centralized quality . The authors of the study advocate for ditching the distinction in transcriptions aimed at foreign learners of German. This neutralization may not apply to all dialects with r-vocalization, particularly the southern ones.

Although there is also a length contrast, vowels are often analyzed according to a tenseness contrast, with long being the tense vowels and short their lax counterparts. Like the English checked vowels, the German lax vowels require a following consonant, with the notable exception of (which is absent in many varieties, as discussed below). is sometimes considered the lax counterpart of tense in order to maintain this tense/lax division. Short occur in unstressed syllables of loanwords, for instance in (&#x27;psychometry&#x27;). They are usually considered allophones of tense vowels (thus ), which cannot occur in unstressed syllables (unless in compounds). is similarly shortened in those positions, with the difference being that it is shortened also in native words, such as aforementioned &#x27;grandpa&#x27; (phonemically ).

In dialects with r-vocalization, historical (phonetically typically a long monophthong ) may undergo a shortening akin to when unstressed, as in one pronunciation of &#x27;radar&#x27; as (phonemically ). An analogous process has taken place in Danish, as in the cognate , meaning the same.

Northern German varieties influenced by Low German could be analyzed as lacking contrasting vowel quantity entirely:
* has a different quality than (see above).
* These varieties also consistently lack , and use only in its place.

====Phonemic status of ====
The existence of a phoneme in German is disputed.
The distinction between the long lax and the long tense does not exist in some varieties of Standard German, and many authors treat the phoneme as peripheral and regard a distinction between it and as a spelling pronunciation. Most commonly, they are merged before an intervocalic , so that potential minimal pairs such as &#x27;ear of grain&#x27; and &#x27;honor&#x27; or &#x27;bears&#x27; and &#x27;berries&#x27; are rendered homophonous, as and . Some authors claim that no distinction between and is possible in this position unless in hypercorrect pronunciation, in which and may be pronounced and , with a tense . Other authors claim that there is regional variation, a distinction occurring especially in southern varieties of Standard German. In contexts other than before intervocalic , the contrast between and is more stable, so that &#x27;bid, conjunctive&#x27;, &#x27;Danes&#x27; and (&#x27;saws, n.&#x27;) may be differentiated from &#x27;to pray&#x27;, &#x27;to stretch&#x27; and &#x27;blessing&#x27;. Even here the vowels can merge, but to a tense : . Scholars who question the existence of a phoneme do so for the following reasons:
# The existence of a phoneme is an irregularity in a vowel system that otherwise has pairs of long and tense vs. short and lax vowels such as vs. . On the other hand, such irregularities are not ruled out by any principle.
# The phoneme has developed out of the spelling of the language rather than from any historical sound change. Most examples of Middle High German /ǣ/ correspond to New High German rather than , indicating that the modern is not a regular development.
# Although some dialects (e.g. Ripuarian and some Alemannic dialects) have an opposition of vs. , their usage does not follow that of the standard. There is also little agreement across dialects as to whether individual lexical items should be pronounced with or with . E.g. South Hessian dialects have in &quot;Käse&quot; but in &quot;Leben&quot;.
# The use of is a spelling pronunciation rather than an original feature of the language. It is an attempt to &quot;speak as printed&quot; () and to differentiate the spellings and (i.e. speakers attempt to justify the appearance of and in writing by making them distinct in the spoken language).

===Diphthongs===

====Phonemic====

* has been variously described as , and .
* has been variously described as , , and .
* has been variously described as , , and .
* is found only in a handful of interjections such as and , and as an alternative to disyllabic in words such as .

====Phonetic====
The following usually are not counted among the German diphthongs as German speakers often feel they are distinct marks of &quot;foreign words&quot; (). These appear only in loanwords:
* , as in , colloquially: .
* Many German speakers use and as adaptations of the English diphthongs and in English loanwords, according to , or they replace them with the native German long vowels and . Thus, the word may be pronounced or . However, and do not recognize these diphthongs as phonemes, and prescribe pronunciations with the long vowels and instead.

In the varieties where speakers vocalize to in the syllable coda, a diphthong ending in may be formed with every stressable vowel:


: notes that the length contrast is not very stable before non-prevocalic and that &quot;, following the pronouncing dictionaries (, ) judge the vowel in , , to be long, while the vowel in , , is supposed to be short. The factual basis of this presumed distinction seems very questionable.&quot; He goes on stating that in his own dialect, there is no length difference in these words, and that judgements on vowel length in front of non-prevocalic which is itself vocalized are problematic, in particular if precedes.

:According to the &quot;lengthless&quot; analysis, the aforementioned &quot;long&quot; diphthongs are analyzed as , , , , , , and . This makes non-prevocalic and homophonous as or . Non-prevocalic and may also merge, but the vowel chart in shows that they have somewhat different starting points – mid-centralized open-mid front for the former, open-mid front for the latter.

: also states that &quot;laxing of the vowel is predicted to take place in shortened vowels; it does indeed seem to go hand in hand with the vowel shortening in many cases.&quot; This leads to , , , , , being pronounced the same as , , , , , . This merger is usual in the Standard Austrian accent, in which e.g. &#x27;bog&#x27; is often pronounced ; this, in contrast with the Standard Northern variety, also happens intervocalically, along with the diphthongization of the laxed vowel to , so that e.g. &#x27;teacher&#x27; is pronounced (the corresponding Standard Northern pronunciation is ). Another feature of the Standard Austrian accent is complete absorption of by the preceding , so that e.g. &#x27;scarce&#x27; is pronounced .

==Consonants==
With around 22 to 26 phonemes, the German consonant system has an average number of consonants in comparison with other languages. One of the more noteworthy ones is the unusual affricate .

* can be uvular, alveolar or even dental, a consonant or a semivowel, see below.
* is bilabial–labiodental , rather than purely labiodental .
* can be apical alveolar , laminal alveolar or laminal denti-alveolar . The other possible pronunciation of that has been reported to occur in unstressed intervocalic positions is retroflex . Austrian German often uses the laminal denti-alveolar articulation.
** is always clear, as in most Irish English accents. A few Austrian accents may use a velarized instead, but that is considered non-standard.
*In the Standard Austrian variety, may be affricated to before front vowels.
* can be laminal alveolar , laminal post-dental (i.e. fronted alveolar, articulated with the blade of the tongue just behind upper front teeth), or even apical alveolar . Austrian German often uses the post-dental articulation. are always strongly fricated.
* are strongly labialized palato-alveolar sibilants . are fricated more weakly than . There are two variants of these sounds:
**Laminal, articulated with the foremost part of the blade of the tongue approaching the foremost part of the hard palate, with the tip of the tongue resting behind either upper or lower front teeth.
**Apico-laminal, articulated with the tip of the tongue approaching the gums and the foremost part of the blade approaching the foremost part of the hard palate. According to , this variant is used more frequently.
* has a number of possible realizations:
** Voiced apical coronal trill , either alveolar (articulated with the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge), or dental (articulated with the tip of the tongue against the back of the upper front teeth).
*** Distribution: Common in the south (Bavaria and many parts of Switzerland and Austria), but it is also found in some speakers in central and northern Germany, especially the elderly. It is also one of possible realizations of in the Standard Austrian accent, but a more common alveolar realization is an approximant . Even more common are uvular realizations, fricatives and a trill .
** Voiced uvular trill , which can be realized as voiceless after voiceless consonants (as in ). According to it is often a flap intervocalically (as in ).
*** Distribution: Occurs in some conservative varieties—most speakers with a uvular realize it as a fricative or an approximant. It is also one of possible realizations of in the Standard Austrian accent, but it is less common than a fricative .
** Dorsal continuant, about the quality of which there is not a complete agreement:
*** describe two fricative variants, namely post-palatal and velar . The post-palatal variant appears before and after front vowels, while the velar variant is used in all other positions.
*** describe it as voiced post-velar fricative . 
*** and describe it as voiced uvular fricative ;
**** states that &quot;with educated professional radio and TV announcers, as with professional actors on the stage and in film, the [voiced uvular] fricative [realization of] clearly predominates.&quot;
***** In the Standard Austrian accent, the uvular fricative is also the most common realization, although its voicing is variable (that is, it can be either voiced or voiceless ).
**** writes that &quot;the place of articulation of the consonant varies from uvular in e.g. (&#x27;red&#x27;) to velar in e.g. (&#x27;kick&#x27;), depending on back or front vowel contexts.&quot; He also notes that is devoiced after voiceless plosives and fricatives, especially those within the same word, giving the word as an example. According to this author, can be reduced to an approximant in an intervocalic position.
*** describe it as a uvular fricative or approximant . The latter is less likely to occur word-initially.
*** Distribution: Almost all areas apart from Bavaria and parts of Switzerland.
** Near-open central unrounded vowel is a post-vocalic allophone of (mostly dorsal) varieties of . The non-syllabic variant of it is not always near-open or central; it is similar to either or , depending on the environment.
*** Distribution: Widespread, but less common in Switzerland.
** Retroflex approximant ɻ⁠] realized like the r in Standard American English.
*** Distribution: Middle Hessian between the Wetterau region and the Westerwald and the Higher Lusatia.
*The voiceless stops , , are aspirated except when preceded by a sibilant. Many southern dialects do not aspirate , and some northern ones do so only in a stressed position. The voiceless affricates , , and are never aspirated, and neither are any other consonants besides the aforementioned .
*The obstruents are voiceless lenis consonants in southern varieties. Voiceless lenis consonants continue to contrast with voiceless fortis consonants . The section covers the issue in more detail.
*In Austria, intervocalic can be lenited to fricatives .
*Before and after front vowels ( and, in varieties that realize them as front, and/or ), the velar consonants are realized as post-palatal . According to , in a parallel process, before and after back vowels ( and, in varieties that realize them as back, and/or ) are retracted to post-velar or even uvular .
*There is no complete agreement about the nature of ; it has been variously described as:
**a fricative ,
**a fricative which can be fricated less strongly than ,
**a sound variable between a weak fricative and an approximant, and
**an approximant , which is the usual realization in the Standard Austrian variety.
*In many varieties of standard German, the glottal stop, , occurs in careful speech before word stems that begin with a vowel and before stressed vowels word-internally, as in &quot;Oase&quot; [ʔo.ʔaː.zə] (twice). It is much more frequent in northern varieties than in the south. It is not usually considered a phoneme. In colloquial and dialectal speech, is often omitted, especially when the word beginning with a vowel is unstressed.
*The phonemic status of affricates is controversial. The majority view accepts and , but not or the non-native ; some accept none, some accept all but , and some accept all.
**Although occurs in native words, it only appears in historic clusters of + (e.g. &quot;deutsch&quot; &lt; OHG &quot;diutisc&quot;) or in words with expressive quality (e.g. &quot;glitschen&quot;, &quot;hutschen&quot;). is, however, well-established in loanwords, including German toponyms of non-Germanic origin (e.g. &quot;Zschopau&quot;).
** and occur only in words of foreign origin. In certain varieties, they are replaced by and altogether.
* is occasionally considered to be an allophone of , especially in southern varieties of German.
* and are traditionally regarded as allophones after front vowels and back vowels, respectively. For a more detailed analysis see below at &quot;ich-Laut&quot; and &quot;ach-Laut&quot;. According to some analyses, is an allophone of after and according to some also after . However, according to , the uvular allophone is used after only in the Standard Austrian variety.
*Some phonologists do not posit a separate phoneme and use instead, along with instead of . The phoneme sequence is realized as when can start a valid onset of the next syllable whose nucleus is a vowel other than unstressed , , or . It becomes otherwise. For example:
** 
** 

===&quot;Ich-Laut&quot; and &quot;ach-Laut&quot;===

&#x27; is the voiceless palatal fricative (which is found in the word &#x27;I&#x27;), and &#x27; is the voiceless velar fricative (which is found in the word the interjection &#x27;oh&#x27;, &#x27;alas&#x27;). is the German word for &#x27;sound, phone&#x27;. In German, these two sounds are allophones occurring in complementary distribution. The allophone occurs after back vowels and (for instance in &#x27;book&#x27;), the allophone after front vowels (for instance in &#x27;me/myself&#x27;) and consonants (for instance in &#x27;fear&#x27;, &#x27;sometimes&#x27;). The allophone also appears after vocalized in superregional variants, e.g. in &#x27;fear&#x27;. In southeastern regiolects, the is commonly used here, yielding .

In loanwords, the pronunciation of potential fricatives in onsets of stressed syllables varies: in the Northern varieties of standard German, it is , while in Southern varieties, it is , and in Western varieties, it is (for instance in : vs. vs. ).

The diminutive suffix is always pronounced with an . Usually, this ending triggers umlaut (compare for instance &#x27;dog&#x27; to &#x27;little dog&#x27;), so theoretically, it could only occur after front vowels. However, in some comparatively recent coinings, there is no longer an umlaut, for instance in the word (a diminutive of &#x27;woman&#x27;), so that a back vowel is followed by a , even though normally it would be followed by a , as in (&#x27;to smoke&#x27;). This exception to the allophonic distribution may be an effect of the morphemic boundary or an example of &quot;phonemicization&quot;, where erstwhile allophones undergo a split into separate phonemes.

The allophonic distribution of after front vowels and after other vowels is also found in other languages, such as Scots, e.g. &quot;licht&quot; &#x27;light&#x27;, &quot;dochter&quot; &#x27;daughter&#x27;, and the same distribution is reconstructed for Middle English. However, it is by no means inevitable: Dutch, Yiddish, and many Southern German dialects retain (which can be realized as instead) in all positions. It is thus reasonable to assume that Old High German &quot;ih&quot;, the ancestor of modern , was pronounced with rather than . While it is impossible to know for certain whether Old English words such as &quot;niht&quot; (modern &quot;night&quot;) were pronounced with or , is likely (see Old English phonology).

Despite the phonetic history, the complementary distribution of and in modern Standard German is better described as backing of after a back vowel, rather than fronting of after a front vowel, because is used in onsets ( &#x27;chemistry&#x27;) and after consonants ( &#x27;newt&#x27;), and is thus the underlying form of the phoneme.

According to Kohler, the German is further differentiated into two allophones, and : occurs after (for instance in &#x27;book&#x27;) and after (for instance in &#x27;brook&#x27;), while either or may occur after , with predominating.

In Western varieties, there is a strong tendency to realize as unrounded or , and the phoneme may be confused or merged with altogether, secondarily leading to hypercorrection effects where is replaced with , for instance in , which may be realized as .

Within German dialects, a large variation exists as to the environments which trigger or prevent one realization or the other.

===Fortis–lenis pairs===
Various German consonants occur in pairs at the same place of articulation and in the same manner of articulation, namely the pairs , , , , . These pairs are often called fortis–lenis pairs, since describing them as voiced–voiceless pairs is inadequate. With certain qualifications, , and are also considered fortis–lenis pairs.

Fortis-lenis distinction for is unimportant.

The fortis stops are aspirated in many varieties. The aspiration is strongest in the onset of a stressed syllable (such as &#x27;thaler&#x27;), weaker in the onset of an unstressed syllable (such as &#x27;father&#x27;), and weakest in the syllable coda (such as in &#x27;seed&#x27;). All fortis consonants, i.e. are fully voiceless.

The lenis consonants range from being weakly voiced to almost voiceless after voiceless consonants: (&#x27;kasbah&#x27;), (&#x27;to resign&#x27;), (&#x27;red-yellow&#x27;), (&#x27;dropping&#x27;), (&#x27;intention&#x27;), (&#x27;wooden jalousie&#x27;), (&#x27;to chase away&#x27;), (&#x27;to drop&#x27;), (&#x27;fruit juice&#x27;). states that they are &quot;to a large extent voiced&quot; in all other environments, but some studies have found the stops to be voiceless word/utterance-initially in most dialects (while still contrasting with due to the aspiration of the latter).

 are voiceless in most southern varieties of German. For clarity, they are often transcribed as .

The nature of the phonetic difference between the voiceless lenis consonants and the similarly voiceless fortis consonants is controversial. It is generally described as a difference in articulatory force, and occasionally as a difference in articulatory length; for the most part, it is assumed that one of these characteristics implies the other.

In various central and southern varieties, the opposition between fortis and lenis is neutralized in the syllable onset; sometimes just in the onset of stressed syllables, sometimes in all cases.

The pair is not considered a fortis–lenis pair, but a simple voiceless–voiced pair, as remains voiced in all varieties, including the Southern varieties that devoice the lenes (with however some exceptions). Generally, the southern is realized as the voiced approximant . However, there are southern varieties which differentiate between a fortis (such as in &#x27;culpable&#x27; from Middle High German stræflich) and a lenis (, such as in &#x27;polite&#x27; from Middle High German &quot;hovelîch&quot;); this is analogous to the opposition of fortis () and lenis .

====Coda devoicing====
In varieties from Northern Germany, lenis stops in the syllable coda are realized as fortis stops. This does not happen in varieties from Southern Germany, Austria or Switzerland.

Since the lenis stops are unvoiced or at most variably voiced (as stated above), this cannot be called devoicing in the strict sense of the word because it does not involve the loss of phonetic voice. More accurately, it can be called coda fortition or a neutralization of fortis and lenis sounds in the coda. Fricatives are truly and contrastively voiced in Northern Germany. Therefore, the fricatives undergo coda devoicing in the strict sense of the word. It is disputed whether coda devoicing is due to a constraint which specifically operates on syllable codas or whether it arises from constraints which &quot;protect voicing in privileged positions&quot;.

==Stress==

In German words there is always one syllable carrying main stress, with all other syllables either being unstressed or carrying a secondary stress. The position of the main stress syllable has been a matter of debate. Traditionally, word stress is seen as falling onto the first stem syllable. In recent analyses, there is agreement that main stress is placed onto one of the last three (stressable) syllables. Within this &quot;three-syllable window&quot;, word stress is put regularly onto the second-to-last syllable, the penultimate syllable. However, syllable quantity may modify this pattern: a heavy final or prefinal syllable, i.e., one with a long vowel or with one or more consonants in the syllable coda, will usually attract main stress.

;Examples:
* final stress: &quot;Eleˈfant&quot;, &quot;Krokoˈdil&quot;, &quot;Kaˈmel&quot;
* penultimate stress: &quot;ˈTurban, ˈKonsul, ˈBison&quot;
* antepenultimate stress: &quot;ˈPinguin&quot;, &quot; ˈRisiko&quot;, &quot;ˈMonitor&quot;

A set of illustrative examples also stems from Japanese loan words, as these cannot be borrowed with their stress patterns (Japanese has a system of pitch accents, completely different from word stress in Germanic languages):

*final stress: &quot;Shoˈgun&quot;, &quot;Samuˈrai&quot;
* penultimate stress: &quot;Mitsuˈbishi&quot;, &quot;Ikeˈbana&quot;
* antepenultimate stress: &quot;Hiˈroshima&quot;, &quot; ˈOsaka&quot;

A list of Japanese words in German reveals that none of the words with four syllables has initial stress, confirming the &quot;three-syllable-window&quot; analysis. 

Secondary stresses precede the main stress if at least two syllables are present, as in &quot;̩Bib-li- ̩o-the-&#x27;ka-rin&quot;. 

Suffixes, if containing a stressable vowel, are either stressed (&quot;-ei, ion, -al&quot;, etc.) or unstressed (&quot;-ung, -heit, -isch&quot;, etc.) 

In addition, German uses different stresses for separable prefixes and inseparable prefixes in verbs and words derived from such verbs:
* Words beginning with , , , , , , and a few other inseparable prefixes are stressed on the root.
* Words beginning with the separable prefixes , , , , and most prepositional adverbs are stressed on the prefix.
* Some prefixes, notably , , , and , can function as separable or inseparable prefixes and are stressed or not accordingly.
* A few homographs with such prefixes exist. They are not perfect homophones. Consider the word . As (separable prefix), it means &#x27;to rewrite&#x27; and is pronounced , with stress on the first syllable. Its associated noun, is also stressed on the first syllable – . On the other hand, (inseparable prefix) is pronounced , with stress on the second syllable. This word means &#x27;to paraphrase&#x27;, and its associated noun, is also stressed on the second syllable – . Another example is the word ; with stress on the root () it means &#x27;to drive around (an obstacle in the street)&#x27;, and with stress on the prefix () it means &#x27;to run down/over&#x27; or &#x27;to knock down&#x27;.

==Acquisition==

===General===
Like all infants, German infants go through a babbling stage in the early phases of phonological acquisition, during which they produce the sounds they will later use in their first words. Phoneme inventories begin with stops, nasals, and vowels; (contrasting) short vowels and liquids appear next, followed by fricatives and affricates, and finally all other consonants and consonant clusters. Children begin to produce protowords near the end of their first year. These words do not approximate adult forms, yet have a specific and consistent meaning. Early word productions are phonetically simple and usually follow the syllable structure CV or CVC, although this generalization has been challenged. The first vowels produced are , , and , followed by , , and , with rounded vowels emerging last. German children often use phonological processes to simplify their early word production. For example, they may delete an unstressed syllable ( &#x27;chocolate&#x27; pronounced ), or replace a fricative with a corresponding stop ( &#x27;roof&#x27; pronounced ). One case study found that a 17-month-old child acquiring German replaced the voiceless velar fricative with the nearest available continuant , or deleted it altogether ( &#x27;book&#x27; pronounced or ). 

Prosodically, children prefer bisyllabic words with the pattern strong – weak over monosyllabic words.

===Vowel space development===
In 2009, Lintfert examined the development of vowel space of German speakers in their first three years of life. During the babbling stage, vowel distribution has no clear pattern. However, stressed and unstressed vowels already show different distributions in the vowel space. Once word production begins, stressed vowels expand in the vowel space, while the F1 – F2 vowel space of unstressed vowels becomes more centralized. The majority of infants are then capable of stable production of F1. The variability of formant frequencies among individuals decreases with age. After 24 months, infants expand their vowel space individually at different rates. However, if the parents&#x27; utterances possess a well-defined vowel space, their children produce clearly distinguished vowel classes earlier. By about three years old, children command the production of all vowels, and they attempt to produce the four cardinal vowels, , , and , at the extreme limits of the F1–F2 vowel space (i.e., the height and backness of the vowels are made extreme by the infants).
===Nasals===
The acquisition of nasals in German differs from that of Dutch, a phonologically closely related language. German children produce proportionately more nasals in onset position (sounds before a vowel in a syllable) than Dutch children do. German children, once they reached 16 months, also produced significantly more nasals in syllables containing schwas, when compared with Dutch-speaking children. This may reflect differences in the languages the children are being exposed to, although the researchers claim that the development of nasals likely cannot be seen apart from the more general phonological system the child is developing.

===Phonotactic constraints and reading===
A 2006 study examined the acquisition of German in phonologically delayed children (specifically, issues with fronting of velars and stopping of fricatives) and whether they applied phonotactic constraints to word-initial consonant clusters containing these modified consonants. In many cases, the subjects (mean age = 5.1) avoided making phonotactic violations, opting instead for other consonants or clusters in their speech. This suggests that phonotactic constraints do apply to the speech of German children with phonological delay, at least in the case of word-initial consonant clusters. Additional research has also shown that spelling consistencies seen in German raise children&#x27;s phonemic awareness as they acquire reading skills.

==Sound changes==

===Sound changes and mergers===
A common merger is that of at the end of a syllable with or , for instance (&#x27;war&#x27;), but (&#x27;wars&#x27;); (&#x27;he lay&#x27;), but (&#x27;we lay&#x27;). This pronunciation is frequent all over central and northern Germany. It is characteristic of regional languages and dialects, particularly Low German in the North, where represents a fricative, becoming voiceless in the syllable coda, as is common in German (final-obstruent devoicing). However common it is, this pronunciation is considered sub-standard. Only in one case, in the grammatical ending (which corresponds to English &quot;-y&quot;), the fricative pronunciation of final is prescribed by the Siebs standard, for instance (&#x27;important&#x27;), (&#x27;importance&#x27;). The merger occurs neither in Austro-Bavarian and Alemannic German nor in the corresponding varieties of Standard German, and therefore in these regions is pronounced .

Many speakers do not distinguish the affricate from the simple fricative in the beginning of a word, in which case the verb (&#x27;[he] travels&#x27;) and the noun (&#x27;horse&#x27;) are both pronounced . This most commonly occurs in northern and western Germany, where the local dialects did not originally have the sound . Some speakers also have peculiar pronunciation for in the middle or end of a word, replacing the in with a voiceless bilabial fricative, i.e. a consonant produced by pressing air flow through the tensed lips. Thereby (&#x27;drop&#x27;) becomes , rather than .

Many speakers who have a vocalization of after merge this combination with long (i.e. &gt; or &gt; or ). Hereby, (&#x27;sheep&#x27;) and (&#x27;sharp&#x27;) can both be pronounced or . This merger does not occur where is a front vowel while is realised as a back vowel. Here the words are kept distinct as (&#x27;sheep&#x27;) and (&#x27;sharp&#x27;).

In umlaut forms, the difference usually reoccurs: or vs. . Speakers with this merger also often use (instead of formally normal ) where it stems from original . The word (&#x27;arks&#x27;) is thus pronounced , which makes a minimal pair with , arguably making the difference between and phonemic, rather than just allophonic, for these speakers.

In the standard pronunciation, the vowel qualities , , , , as well as , , , , are all still distinguished even in unstressed syllables. In this latter case, however, many simplify the system in various degrees. For some speakers, this may go so far as to merge all four into one, hence misspellings by schoolchildren such as (instead of ) or (instead of &quot;Portugal&quot;).

In everyday speech, more mergers occur, some of which are universal and some of which are typical for certain regions or dialect backgrounds. Overall, there is a strong tendency of reduction and contraction. For example, long vowels may be shortened, consonant clusters may be simplified, word-final may be dropped in some cases, and the suffix may be contracted with preceding consonants, e.g. for (&#x27;to have&#x27;).

If the clusters , , , or are followed by another consonant, the stops , and usually lose their phonemic status. Thus while the standard pronunciation distinguishes (&#x27;whole&#x27;) from (&#x27;goose&#x27;), as well as from , the two pairs are homophones for most speakers. The commonest practice is to drop the stop (thus , for both words), but some speakers insert the stop where it is not etymological (, for both words), or they alternate between the two ways. Only a few speakers retain a phonemic distinction.

===Middle High German===
The Middle High German vowels and developed into the modern Standard German diphthong , whereas and developed into . For example, Middle High German and (&#x27;hot&#x27; and &#x27;white&#x27;) became Standard German and . In some dialects, the Middle High German vowels have not changed, e.g. Swiss German and , while in other dialects or languages, the vowels have changed but the distinction is kept, e.g. Bavarian and , Ripuarian and (however the Colognian dialect has kept the original [ei] diphthong in ), Yiddish &#x27; and &#x27; .

The Middle High German diphthongs , and became the modern Standard German long vowels , and after the Middle High German long vowels changed to diphthongs. Most Upper German dialects retain the diphthongs. A remnant of their former diphthong character is shown when continues to be written in German (as in &#x27;love&#x27;).

==Loanwords==

German incorporates a significant number of loanwords from other languages. Loanwords are often adapted to German phonology but to varying degrees, depending on the speaker and the commonness of the word. and do not occur in native German words but are common in a number of French and English loan words. Many speakers replace them with and respectively (especially in Southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland), so that (from English &quot;jungle&quot;) can be pronounced or . Some speakers in Northern and Western Germany merge with , so that (phonemically ) can be pronounced , or . The realization of as , however, is uncommon.

===Loanwords from English===
Many English words are used in German, especially in technology and pop culture. Some speakers pronounce them similarly to their native pronunciation, but many speakers change non-native phonemes to similar German phonemes (even if they pronounce them in a rather English manner in an English-language setting):
* English are usually pronounced as in RP or General American; some speakers replace them with and respectively (th-alveolarization) e.g. .
* English can be pronounced the same as in English, i.e. , or as the corresponding native German e.g. or . German and Austrian speakers tend to be variably rhotic when using English loanwords.
* English is often replaced with German e.g. .
* word-initial is often retained (especially in the South, where word-initial is common), but many speakers replace it with e.g. .
* word-initial and are usually retained, but some speakers (especially in South Western Germany and Western Austria) replace them with and e.g. or , or .
* English is usually retained, but in Northern and Western Germany as well as Luxembourg, it is often replaced with e.g. .
* In Northern Standard German, final-obstruent devoicing is applied to English loan words just as to other words e.g. , or , . However, in Southern Standard German, in Swiss Standard German and Austrian Standard German, final-obstruent devoicing does not occur and so speakers are more likely to retain the original pronunciation of word-final lenes (although realizing them as fortes may occur because of confusing English spelling with pronunciation).
* English and are often replaced with and respectively e.g. .
* English and are pronounced the same, as German (met–mat merger) e.g. .
* English and are pronounced the same, as German (cot–caught merger) e.g. .
* English is usually pronounced as German e.g. .
* English is usually pronounced as German e.g. or .
* English is pronounced as (happy-tensing) e.g. .

===Loanwords from French===
French loanwords, once very numerous, have in part been replaced by native German coinages or more recently English loanwords. Besides , they can also contain the characteristic nasal vowels , , and (always long). However, their status as phonemes is questionable and they are often resolved into sequences either of (short) oral vowel and (in the north), or of (long or short) oral vowel and or sometimes (in the south). For example, (&#x27;balloon&#x27;) may be realized as or , (&#x27;perfume&#x27;) as or and (&#x27;orange&#x27;) as or .

==Sample==
The sample text is a reading of &quot;The North Wind and the Sun&quot;. The phonemic transcription treats every instance of and as and , respectively. The phonetic transcription is a fairly narrow transcription of the educated northern accent. The speaker transcribed in the narrow transcription is 62 years old, and he is reading in a colloquial style. Aspiration, glottal stops and devoicing of the lenes after fortes are not transcribed.

The audio file contains the whole fable and was recorded by a much younger speaker.

<text>Unreal Tournament 2003 is a first-person arena shooter video game developed by Epic Games and Digital Extremes, and published by Infogrames under the Atari brand name. The game is part of the &quot;Unreal&quot; franchise, and is a sequel to 1999&#x27;s &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;. Like its predecessor, the game is designed mainly for multiplayer gaming. 

The game saw a record 1.2 million downloads when the demo was released. In addition, the Unreal Engine has been widely licensed for games such as the &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot; series, &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;, and &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot;. 

An Xbox port, &quot;Unreal Championship&quot; was released on November 12, 2002. &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot; would be updated into &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot;, which was released on March 16 of that year.

== Gameplay ==
The available combat modes are:
* Deathmatch: Frag other players as much as possible to gain the highest score.
* Team Deathmatch: Two teams go head to head to be the best fragger.
* Capture the Flag: Players must invade the enemies&#x27; base, capture their flag and bring it back to their base in order to score.
* Double Domination: Two teams must control two points on the map. Holding both locations for a certain period of time gives points to the controlling team.
* Bombing Run: The player with the ball has to take it into enemy territory and score in the enemy force&#x27;s goal. Players can pass to other teammates. Getting killed causes the ball carrier to fumble the ball. The ball launcher is used to carry the ball; it is not a weapon but heals the carrying player when they are at low health. Three points are awarded for field goals (shooting the ball through the goal), and 7 points are given for touchdowns (carrying the ball through the goal), although the levels are often designed such that this kills the ball carrier.
* Last Man Standing: All players in this gametype spawn with a limited number of lives. The last remaining player to still have lives wins the match.
* Invasion: A co-op gametype in which the players attempt to kill the invading alien AI. Each player has one life.
* Mutant: Mutant is similar to a &quot;Juggernaut&quot; or a &quot;King of the Hill&quot; type of gameplay. The first person to make a kill becomes the mutant, which gives them unlimited ammo, camouflage, and super speed. The mutant then tries to get as many kills as he can until he is killed. The person who kills the mutant then becomes the mutant.

== Reception ==
&quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot; the best computer game of October 2002.

&quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot; won &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Graphics (Technical) on PC&quot; award, and was nominated in the &quot;Best Multiplayer Action Game on PC&quot; category. During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the game received a nomination for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Visual Engineering&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.

===Sales===
In the United States, &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot; sold 360,000 copies and earned $13.6 million by August 2006. At the time, this led &quot;Edge&quot; to declare it the country&#x27;s 45th-best-selling computer game, and best-selling &quot;Unreal&quot; title, released since January 2000. Combined sales of all &quot;Unreal&quot; computer games released between January 2000 and August 2006 had reached 1.8 million units in the United States by the latter date. In December 2002, the game received a &quot;Gold&quot; sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

In its first month, &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot; sold more than 800,000 copies worldwide.

<doc id="467626" wikidata="Q47496" url="?curid=467626" title="Marina Abramović">
<text>Marina Abramović (, ; born November 30, 1946) is a Serbian conceptual and performance artist. Her work explores body art, endurance art, the relationship between the performer and audience, the limits of the body, and the possibilities of the mind. Being active for over four decades, Abramović refers to herself as the &quot;grandmother of performance art&quot;. She pioneered a new notion of identity by bringing in the participation of observers, focusing on &quot;confronting pain, blood, and physical limits of the body&quot;. In 2007, she founded the Marina Abramović Institute (MAI), a non-profit foundation for performance art.

==Early life, education and teaching==
Abramović was born in Belgrade, Serbia, then part of Yugoslavia, on November 30, 1946. In an interview, Abramović described her family as having been &quot;Red bourgeoisie&quot;. Her great-uncle was Varnava, Serbian Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Both of her Montenegrin-born parents, Danica Rosić and Vojin Abramović, were Yugoslav Partisans during World War II. After the war, Abramović&#x27;s parents were awarded Order of the People&#x27;s Heroes and were given positions in the postwar Yugoslavian government.

Abramović was raised by her grandparents until she was six years old. Her grandmother was deeply religious and Abramović &quot;spent [her] childhood in a church following [her] grandmother&#x27;s rituals—candles in the morning, the priest coming for different occasions&quot;. When she was six, her brother was born, and she began living with her parents while also taking piano, French, and English lessons. Although she did not take art lessons, she took an early interest in art and enjoyed painting as a child.

Life in Abramović&#x27;s parental home under her mother&#x27;s strict supervision was difficult. When Abramović was a child, her mother beat her for &quot;supposedly showing off&quot;. In an interview published in 1998, Abramović described how her &quot;mother took complete military-style control of me and my brother. I was not allowed to leave the house after 10 o&#x27;clock at night until I was 29 years old. ... [A]ll the performances in Yugoslavia I did before 10 o&#x27;clock in the evening because I had to be home then. It&#x27;s completely insane, but all of my cutting myself, whipping myself, burning myself, almost losing my life in &#x27;The Firestar&#x27;—everything was done before 10 in the evening.&quot;

In an interview published in 2013, Abramović said, &quot;My mother and father had a terrible marriage.&quot; Describing an incident when her father smashed 12 champagne glasses and left the house, she said, &quot;It was the most horrible moment of my childhood.&quot;

== Education and teaching career ==
She was a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade from 1965 to 1970. She completed her post-graduate studies in the art class of Krsto Hegedušić at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb, SR Croatia, in 1972. Then she returned to SR Serbia and, from 1973 to 1975, taught at the Academy of Fine Arts at Novi Sad while launching her first solo performances. &quot;See also: Role Exchange&quot; (1975 performative artwork)

In 1976, following her marriage to Neša Paripović (between 1970 and 1976), Abramović went to Amsterdam to perform a piece and then decided to move there permanently.

From 1990 to 1995, Abramović was a visiting professor at the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris and at the Berlin University of the Arts. From 1992 to 1996 she also served as a visiting professor at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg and from 1997 to 2004 she was a professor for performance-art at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Braunschweig.

==Career==

===&quot;Rhythm 10&quot;, 1973===
In her first performance in Edinburgh in 1973, Abramović explored elements of ritual and gesture. Making use of ten knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the Russian game, in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one&#x27;s hand, the title of the piece getting its name from the number of knives used. Each time she cut herself, she would pick up a new knife from the row of ten she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself ten times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body – the pain and the sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramović began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. &quot;Once you enter into the performance state you can push your body to do things you absolutely could never normally do.&quot;

===&quot;Rhythm 5&quot;, 1974===
In this performance, Abramović sought to re-evoke the energy of extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire at the start of the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramović cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When finished with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star or pentagram represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramović leapt across the flames into the center of the large pentagram. At first, due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen inside the star. However, when the flames came very near to her body and she still remained inert, a doctor and others intervened and extricated her from the star.

Abramović later commented upon this experience: &quot;I was very angry because I understood there is a physical limit. When you lose consciousness you can&#x27;t be present, you can&#x27;t perform.&quot;

===&quot;Rhythm 2&quot;, 1974===
Prompted by her loss of consciousness during &quot;Rhythm 5&quot;, Abramović devised the two-part &quot;Rhythm 2&quot; to incorporate a state of unconsciousness in a performance. She performed the work at the Gallery of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, in 1974. In Part I, which had a duration of 50 minutes, she ingested a medication she describes as &#x27;given to patients who suffer from catatonia, to force them to change the positions of their bodies.&#x27; The medication caused her muscles to contract violently, and she lost complete control over her body while remaining aware of what was going on. After a ten-minute break, she took a second medication &#x27;given to schizophrenic patients with violent behavior disorders to calm them down.&#x27; The performance ended after five hours when the medication wore off.

===&quot;Rhythm 4&quot;, 1974===
&quot;Rhythm 4&quot; was performed at the Galleria Diagramma in Milan. In this piece, Abramović knelt alone and naked in a room with a high-power industrial fan. She approached the fan slowly, attempting to breathe in as much air as possible to push the limits of her lungs. Soon after she lost consciousness.

Abramović&#x27;s previous experience in &quot;Rhythm 5&quot;, when the audience interfered in the performance, led to her devising specific plans so that her loss of consciousness would not interrupt the performance before it was complete. Before the beginning of her performance, Abramović asked the cameraman to focus only on her face, disregarding the fan. This was so the audience would be oblivious to her unconscious state, and therefore unlikely to interfere. Ironically, after several minutes of Abramović&#x27;s unconsciousness, the cameraman refused to continue and sent for help.

===&quot;Rhythm 0&quot;, 1974===

To test the limits of the relationship between performer and audience, Abramović developed one of her most challenging and best-known performances. She assigned a passive role to herself, with the public being the force that would act on her. Abramović placed on a table 72 objects that people were allowed to use in any way that they chose; a sign informed them that they held no responsibility for any of their actions. Some of the objects could give pleasure, while others could be wielded to inflict pain, or to harm her. Among them were a rose, a feather, honey, a whip, olive oil, scissors, a scalpel, a gun and a single bullet. For six hours the artist allowed audience members to manipulate her body and actions without consequences. This tested how vulnerable and aggressive human subjects could be when actions have no social consequences. At first the audience did not do much and was extremely passive. However, as the realization began to set in that there was no limit to their actions, the piece became brutal. By the end of the performance, her body was stripped, attacked, and devalued into an image that Abramović described as the &quot;Madonna, mother, and whore.&quot; As Abramović described it later: &quot;What I learned was that ... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you. ... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.&quot; 

In her works, Abramović defines her identity in contradistinction to that of spectators; however, more importantly, by blurring the roles of each party, the identity and nature of humans individually and collectively also become less clear. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and truths are revealed. Abramović&#x27;s art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains passive and allows spectators to do as they please to her; the audience pushes the limits of what might be considered acceptable. By presenting her body as an object, she explores the limits of danger and exhaustion a human can endure.

===Works with Ulay (Uwe Laysiepen)===
In 1976, after moving to Amsterdam, Abramović met the West German performance artist Uwe Laysiepen, who went by the single name Ulay. They began living and performing together that year. When Abramović and Ulay began their collaboration, the main concepts they explored were the ego and artistic identity. They created &quot;relation works&quot; characterized by constant movement, change, process and &quot;art vital&quot;. This was the beginning of a decade of influential collaborative work. Each performer was interested in the traditions of their cultural heritage and the individual&#x27;s desire for ritual. Consequently, they decided to form a collective being called &quot;The Other&quot;, and spoke of themselves as parts of a &quot;two-headed body&quot;. They dressed and behaved like twins and created a relationship of complete trust. As they defined this phantom identity, their individual identities became less defined. In an analysis of phantom artistic identities, Charles Green has noted that this allowed a deeper understanding of the artist as performer, since it revealed a way of &quot;having the artistic self made available for self-scrutiny&quot;.

The work of Abramović and Ulay tested the physical limits of the body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, transcendental meditation, and nonverbal communication. While some critics have explored the idea of a hermaphroditic state of being as a feminist statement, Abramović herself rejects this analysis. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents&#x27; military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with gender ideologies, Abramović/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: &quot;The main problem in this relationship was what to do with the two artists&#x27; egos. I had to find out how to put my ego down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that we called the death self.&quot;
* In &quot;Relation in Space&quot; (1976) they ran into each other repeatedly for an hour – mixing male and female energy into the third component called &quot;that self&quot;.
* &quot;Relation in Movement&quot; (1977) had the pair driving their car inside of a museum for 365 laps; a black liquid oozed from the car, forming a kind of sculpture, each lap representing a year. (After 365 laps the idea was that they entered the New Millennium.)
* In &quot;Relation in Time&quot; (1977) they sat back to back, tied together by their ponytails for sixteen hours. They then allowed the public to enter the room to see if they could use the energy of the public to push their limits even further.
* To create &quot;Breathing In/Breathing Out&quot; the two artists devised a piece in which they connected their mouths and took in each other&#x27;s exhaled breaths until they had used up all of the available oxygen. Nineteen minutes after the beginning of the performance they pulled away from each other, their lungs having filled with carbon dioxide. This personal piece explored the idea of an individual&#x27;s ability to absorb the life of another person, exchanging and destroying it.
* In &quot;Imponderabilia&quot; (1977, reenacted in 2010) two performers of opposite sexes, both completely nude, stand in a narrow doorway. The public must squeeze between them in order to pass, and in doing so choose which one of them to face.
* In &quot;AAA-AAA&quot; (1978) the two artists stood opposite each other and made long sounds with their mouths open. They gradually moved closer and closer, until they were eventually yelling directly into each other&#x27;s mouths. This piece demonstrated their interest in endurance and duration.
* In 1980, they performed &quot;Rest Energy,&quot; in an art exhibition in Amsterdam, where both balanced each other on opposite sides of a drawn bow and arrow, with the arrow pointed at Abramović&#x27;s heart. With almost no effort, Ulay could easily kill Abramović with one finger. This was intended to represent the power advantage men have over women in society. In addition, the handle of the bow is held by Abramović and is pointed at herself. The handle of the bow is the most significant part of a bow. This would be a whole different piece if it were Ulay aiming a bow at Abramović, but by having her hold the bow, even while her life is subject to his will, she supports him.

Between 1981 and 1987, the pair performed &quot;Nightsea Crossing&quot; in twenty-two performances. They sat silently across from each other in chairs for seven hours a day.

In 1988, after several years of tense relations, Abramović and Ulay decided to make a spiritual journey that would end their relationship. They each walked the Great Wall of China, in a piece called &quot;Lovers&quot;, starting from the two opposite ends and meeting in the middle. As Abramović described it: &quot;That walk became a complete personal drama. Ulay started from the Gobi Desert and I from the Yellow Sea. After each of us walked 2500 km, we met in the middle and said good-bye.&quot; She has said that she conceived this walk in a dream, and it provided what she thought was an appropriate, romantic ending to a relationship full of mysticism, energy, and attraction. She later described the process: &quot;We needed a certain form of ending, after this huge distance walking towards each other. It is very human. It is in a way more dramatic, more like a film ending ... Because in the end, you are really alone, whatever you do.&quot; She reported that during her walk she was reinterpreting her connection to the physical world and to nature. She felt that the metals in the ground influenced her mood and state of being; she also pondered the Chinese myths in which the Great Wall has been described as a &quot;dragon of energy&quot;. It took the couple eight years to acquire permission from the Chinese government to perform the work, by which time their relationship had completely dissolved.

At her 2010 MoMA retrospective, Abramović performed &quot;The Artist Is Present&quot;, in which she shared a period of silence with each stranger who sat in front of her. Although &quot;they met and talked the morning of the opening&quot;, Abramović had a deeply emotional reaction to Ulay when he arrived at her performance, reaching out to him across the table between them; the video of the event went viral.

In November 2015, Ulay took Abramović to court, claiming she had paid him insufficient royalties according to the terms of a 1999 contract covering sales of their joint works and a year later, in September 2016, Abramović was ordered to pay Ulay €250,000. In its ruling, the court in Amsterdam found that Ulay was entitled to royalties of 20% net on the sales of their works, as specified in the original 1999 contract, and ordered Abramović to backdate royalties of more than €250,000, as well as more than €23,000 in legal costs. Additionally, she was ordered to credit all works created between 1976 and 1980 as &quot;Ulay/Abramović&quot; and all works created between 1981 and 1988 as &quot;Abramović/Ulay&quot;.

===&quot;Cleaning the Mirror&quot;, 1995===

&quot;Cleaning the Mirror&quot; consisted of five monitors playing footage in which Abramović scrubs a grimy human skeleton in her lap. She vigorously brushes the different parts of the skeleton with soapy water. Each monitor is dedicated to one part of the skeleton: the head, the pelvis, the ribs, the hands, and the feet. Each video is filmed with its own sound, creating an overlap. As the skeleton becomes cleaner, Abramović becomes covered in the grayish dirt that was once covering the skeleton. This three-hour performance is filled with metaphors of the Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality. The piece was composed of three parts. &quot;Cleaning the Mirror&quot; #1, lasting three hours, was performed at the Museum of Modern Art. &quot;Cleaning the Mirror&quot; #2 lasts 90 minutes and was performed at Oxford University. &quot;Cleaning the Mirror&quot; #3 was performed at Pitt Rivers Museum over five hours.

===&quot;Spirit Cooking&quot;, 1996===
Abramović worked with Jacob Samuel to produce a cookbook of &quot;aphrodisiac recipes&quot; called &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot; in 1996. These &quot;recipes&quot; were meant to be &quot;evocative instructions for actions or for thoughts&quot;. For example, one of the recipes calls for &quot;13,000 grams of jealousy&quot;, while another says to &quot;mix fresh breast milk with fresh sperm milk.&quot; The work was inspired by the popular belief that ghosts feed off intangible things like light, sound, and emotions.

In 1997, Abramović created a multimedia &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot; installation. This was originally installed in the Zerynthia Associazione per l&#x27;Arte Contemporanea in Rome, Italy, and included white gallery walls with &quot;enigmatically violent recipe instructions&quot; painted in pig&#x27;s blood. According to Alexxa Gotthardt, the work is &quot;a comment on humanity&#x27;s reliance on ritual to organize and legitimize our lives and contain our bodies&quot;.

Abramovic also published a &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot; cookbook, containing comico-mystical, self-help instructions that are meant to be poetry. &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot; later evolved into a form of dinner party entertainment that Abramovic occasionally lays on for collectors, donors, and friends.

===&quot;Balkan Baroque&quot;, 1997===
In this piece, Abramović vigorously scrubbed thousands of bloody cow bones over a period of four days, a reference to the ethnic cleansing that had taken place in the Balkans during the 1990s. This performance piece earned Abramović the Golden Lion award at the Venice Biennale.

Abramović created &quot;Balkan Baroque&quot; as a response to the war in Bosnia. She remembers other artists reacting immediately, creating work and protesting about the effects and horrors of the war. Abramović could not bring herself to create work on the matter so soon, as it hit too close to home for her. Eventually, Abramović returned to Belgrade, where she interviewed her mother, her father, and a rat-catcher. She then incorporated these interviews into her piece, as well as clips of the hands of her father holding a pistol and her mother&#x27;s empty hands and later, her crossed hands. Abramović is dressed as a doctor recounting the story of the rat-catcher. While the clips are playing, Abramović sits among a large pile of bones and tries to wash them.

The performance occurred in Venice in 1997. Abramović remembered the horrible smell – for it was extremely hot in Venice that summer – and that worms emerged from the bones. She has explained that the idea of scrubbing the bones clean and trying to remove the blood, is impossible. The point Abramović was trying to make is that blood can&#x27;t be washed from bones and hands, just as the war couldn&#x27;t be cleansed of shame. She wanted to allow the images from the performance to speak for not only the war in Bosnia, but for any war, anywhere in the world.

===&quot;Seven Easy Pieces&quot;, 2005===
Beginning on November 9, 2005, Abramović presented &quot;Seven Easy Pieces&quot; commissioned by Performa, at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. On seven consecutive nights for seven hours she recreated the works of five artists first performed in the 1960s and 1970s, in addition to re-performing her own &quot;Thomas Lips&quot; and introducing a new performance on the last night. The performances were arduous, requiring both the physical and the mental concentration of the artist. Included in Abramović&#x27;s performances were recreations of Gina Pane&#x27;s &quot;The Conditioning&quot;, which required lying on a bed frame suspended over a grid of lit candles, and of Vito Acconci&#x27;s 1972 performance in which the artist masturbated under the floorboards of a gallery as visitors walked overhead. It is argued that Abramović re-performed these works as a series of homages to the past, though many of the performances were altered from the originals. All seven performances were dedicated to Abramović&#x27;s late friend Susan Sontag.

A full list of the works performed is as follows:
* Bruce Nauman&#x27;s &quot;Body Pressure&quot; (1974)
* Vito Acconci&#x27;s &quot;Seedbed&quot; (1972)
* Valie Export&#x27;s &quot;Action Pants: Genital Panic&quot; (1969)
* Gina Pane&#x27;s &quot;The Conditioning&quot; (1973)
* Joseph Beuys&#x27;s &quot;How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare&quot; (1965)
* Abramović&#x27;s own &quot;Thomas Lips&quot; (1975)
* Abramović&#x27;s own &quot;Entering the Other Side&quot; (2005)

===&quot;The Artist Is Present&quot;: March–May 2010===

From March 14 to May 31, 2010, the Museum of Modern Art held a major retrospective and performance recreation of Abramović&#x27;s work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA&#x27;s history, curated by Klaus Biesenbach. Biesenbach also provided the title for the performance, which referred to the fact that during the entire performance &quot;the artist would be &quot;right there&quot; in the gallery or the museum.&quot;

During the run of the exhibition, Abramović performed &quot;The Artist Is Present&quot;, a 736-hour and 30-minute static, silent piece, in which she sat immobile in the museum&#x27;s atrium while spectators were invited to take turns sitting opposite her. Ulay made a surprise appearance at the opening night of the show.

Abramović sat in a rectangle marked with tape on the floor of the second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to get a better place in line. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less, while a few sat with her for an entire day. The line attracted no attention from museum security until the last day of the exhibition, when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from the realization that the longer the earlier visitors spent with Abramović, the less chance that those further back in line would be able to sit with her. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have wondered whether Abramović wore an adult diaper in order to eliminate the need for bathroom breaks. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramović sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed, Alan Rickman, Jemima Kirke, Jennifer Carpenter, and Björk; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to her. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramović concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.

A support group for the &quot;sitters&quot;, &quot;Sitting with Marina&quot;, was established on Facebook, as was the blog &quot;Marina Abramović made me cry&quot;. The Italian photographer Marco Anelli took portraits of every person who sat opposite Abramović, which were published on Flickr, compiled in a book and featured in an exhibition at the Danziger Gallery in New York.

Abramović said the show changed her life &quot;completely – every possible element, every physical emotion&quot;. After Lady Gaga saw the show and publicized it, Abramović found a new audience: &quot;So the kids from 12 and 14 years old to about 18, the public who normally don&#x27;t go to the museum, who don&#x27;t give a shit about performance art or don&#x27;t even know what it is, started coming because of Lady Gaga. And they saw the show and then they started coming back. And that&#x27;s how I get a whole new audience.&quot; In September 2011, a video game version of Abramović&#x27;s performance was released by Pippin Barr. In 2013, Dale Eisinger of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked &quot;The Artist Is Present&quot; ninth (along with &quot;Rhythm 0&quot;) in his list of the greatest performance art works.

Her performance inspired Australian novelist Heather Rose to write &quot;The Museum of Modern Love&quot; and she subsequently launched the US edition of the book at the Museum of Modern Art in 2018.

===Other===

In 2009, Abramović was featured in Chiara Clemente&#x27;s documentary &quot;Our City Dreams&quot; and a book of the same name. The five featured artists – also including Swoon, Ghada Amer, Kiki Smith, and Nancy Spero – &quot;each possess a passion for making work that is inseparable from their devotion to New York&quot;, according to the publisher. Abramović is also the subject of an independent documentary film entitled &quot;Marina Abramović: The Artist Is Present&quot;, which is based on her life and performance at her retrospective &quot;The Artist Is Present&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art in 2010. The film was broadcast in the United States on HBO and won a Peabody Award in 2012. In January 2011, Abramović was on the cover of Serbian &quot;ELLE&quot;, photographed by Dušan Reljin. Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;2312&quot; mentions a style of performance art pieces known as &quot;abramovics&quot;.

A world premiere installation by Abramović was featured at Toronto&#x27;s Trinity Bellwoods Park as part of the Luminato Festival in June 2013. Abramović is also co-creator, along with Robert Wilson of the theatrical production &quot;The Life and Death of Marina Abramović&quot;, which had its North American premiere at the festival, and at the Park Avenue Armory in December.

In 2007 Abramović created the Marina Abramović Institute (MAI), a nonprofit foundation for performance art, in a 33,000 square-foot space in Hudson, New York. She also founded a performance institute in San Francisco. She is a patron of the London-based Live Art Development Agency.

In June 2014 she presented a new piece at London&#x27;s Serpentine Gallery called &quot;512 Hours&quot;. In the Sean Kelly Gallery-hosted &quot;Generator&quot;, (December 6, 2014) participants are blindfolded and wear noise-canceling headphones in an exploration of nothingness.

In celebration of her 70th birthday on November 30, 2016, Abramović took over the Guggenheim museum (eleven years after her previous installation there) for her birthday party entitled &quot;Marina 70&quot;. Part one of the evening, titled &quot;Silence,&quot; lasted 70 minutes, ending with the crash of a gong struck by the artist. Then came the more conventional part two: &quot;Entertainment&quot;, during which Abramović took to the stage to make a speech before watching English singer and visual artist ANOHNI perform the song &quot;My Way&quot; while wearing a large black hood.

In March 2015, Abramović presented a TED talk titled, &quot;An art made of trust, vulnerability and connection&quot;.

In 2019, IFC&#x27;s mockumentary show &quot;Documentary Now!&quot; parodied Abramović&#x27;s work and the documentary film &quot;Marina Abramović: The Artist Is Present.&quot; The show&#x27;s episode, entitled &quot;Waiting for the Artist&quot;, starred Cate Blanchett as Isabella Barta (Abramović) and Fred Armisen as Dimo (Ulay).

Originally set to open on September 26, 2020, her first major exhibition in the UK at the Royal Academy of Arts was rescheduled for autumn 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Academy, the exhibition would &quot;bring together works spanning her 50-year career, along with new works conceived especially for these galleries. As Abramović approaches her mid-70s, her new work reflects on changes to the artist&#x27;s body, and explores her perception of the transition between life and death.&quot; On reviewing this exhibition Tabish Khan, writing for Culture Whisper, described it thus: “It’s intense, it’s discomfiting, it’s memorable, and it’s performance art at its finest&quot;.

In 2021, she dedicated a monument, entitled, &quot;Crystal wall of crying&quot;, at the site of a Holocaust massacre in Ukraine and which is memorialized through the Babi Yar memorials.

In 2022, she condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In 2023, she was the first woman in 255 years to be invited to give a solo show in the main galleries of the Royal Academy.

===Unfulfilled proposals===

Abramović had proposed some solo performances during her career that never were performed. One such proposal was titled &quot;Come to Wash with Me&quot;. This performance would take place in a gallery space that was to be transformed into a laundry with sinks placed all around the walls of the gallery. The public would enter the space and be asked to take off all of their clothes and give them to Abramović. The individuals would then wait around as she would wash, dry and iron their clothes for them, and once she was done, she would give them back their clothing, and they could get dressed and then leave. She proposed this in 1969 for the Galerija Doma Omladine in Belgrade. The proposal was refused.

In 1970 she proposed a similar idea to the same gallery that was also refused. The piece was untitled. Abramović would stand in front of the public dressed in her regular clothing. Present on the side of the stage was a clothes rack adorned with clothing that her mother wanted her to wear. She would take the clothing one by one and change into them, then stand to face the public for a while. &quot;From the right pocket of my skirt I take a gun. From the left pocket of my skirt I take a bullet. I put the bullet into the chamber and turn it. I place the gun to my temple. I pull the trigger.&quot; The performance had two possible outcomes.

The list of Mother&#x27;s clothes included:
# Heavy brown pin for the hair
# White cotton blouse with red dots
# Light pink bra – 2 sizes too big
# Dark pink heavy flannel slip – three sizes too big
# Dark blue skirt – mid-calf
# Skin color heavy synthetic stockings
# Heavy orthopedic shoes with laces

==Films==
Abramović directed a segment, &quot;Balkan Erotic Epic&quot;, in &quot;Destricted&quot;, a compilation of erotic films made in 2006. In 2008 she directed a segment &quot;Dangerous Games&quot; in another film compilation &quot;&quot;. She also acted in a five-minute short film &quot;Antony and the Johnsons: Cut the World&quot;.

==Marina Abramović Institute==
The Marina Abramović Institute (MAI) is a performance art organization with a focus on performance, works of long duration, and the use of the &quot;Abramovic Method&quot;.

In its early phases, it was a proposed multi-functional museum space in Hudson, New York. Abramović purchased the site for the institute in 2007. Located in Hudson, New York, the building was built in 1933 and has been used as a theater and community tennis center. The building was to be renovated according to a design by Rem Koolhaas and Shohei Shigematsu of OMA. The early design phase of this project was funded by a Kickstarter campaign. It was funded by more than 4,000 contributors, including Lady Gaga and Jay-Z. The building project was canceled in October 2017 due to its excessive cost.

The institute continues to operate as a traveling organization. To date, MAI has partnered with many institutions and artists internationally, traveling to Brazil, Greece, and Turkey.

==Collaborations==
In her youth, she was a performer in one of Hermann Nitsch&#x27;s performances which were part of the Viennese actionism.

Abramović maintains a friendship with actor James Franco, who interviewed her for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2009. Franco visited her during &quot;The Artist Is Present&quot; in 2010, and the two also attended the 2012 Met Gala together.

In July 2013, Abramović worked with Lady Gaga on the pop singer&#x27;s third album &quot;Artpop&quot;. Gaga&#x27;s work with Abramović, as well as artists Jeff Koons and Robert Wilson, was displayed at an event titled &quot;ArtRave&quot; on November 10. Furthermore, both have collaborated on projects supporting the Marina Abramović Institute, including Gaga&#x27;s participation in an &#x27;Abramović Method&#x27; video and a nonstop reading of Stanisław Lem&#x27;s sci-fi novel &quot;Solaris&quot;.

Also that month, Jay-Z showcased an Abramović-inspired piece at Pace Gallery in New York City. He performed his art-inspired track &quot;Picasso Baby&quot; for six straight hours. During the performance, Abramović and several figures in the art world were invited to dance with him standing face to face. The footage was later turned into the music video for the aforementioned song. She allowed Jay-Z to adapt &quot;The Artist Is Present&quot; under the condition that he would donate to her institute. Abramović stated that Jay-Z did not live up to his end of the deal, describing the performance as a &quot;one-way transaction&quot;. However, two years later in 2015, Abramović publicly issued an apology stating she was never informed of Jay-Z&#x27;s sizable donation.

==Controversies==
Abramović sparked controversy in August 2016 when passages from an early draft of her memoir were released, in which—based on notes from her 1979 initial encounter with Aboriginal Australians—she compared them to dinosaurs and observed that &quot;they have big torsos (just one bad result of their encounter with Western civilization is a high sugar diet that bloats their bodies) and sticklike legs&quot;. She responded to the controversy on Facebook, writing, &quot;I have the greatest respect for the Aborigine people, to whom I owe everything.&quot;

Among the Podesta emails was a message from Abramović to Podesta&#x27;s brother discussing an invitation to a spirit cooking, which was interpreted by conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones as an invitation to a satanic ritual, and was presented by Jones and others as proof that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had links to the occult. In a 2013 Reddit Q&amp;A, in response to a question about occult in contemporary art, she said: &quot;Everything depends on which context you are doing what you are doing. If you are doing the occult magic in the context of art or in a gallery, then it is the art. If you are doing it in different context, in spiritual circles or private house or on TV shows, it is not art. The intention, the context for what is made, and where it is made defines what art is or not&quot;. 

On April 10, 2020, Microsoft released a promotional video for HoloLens 2 which featured Abramović. However, due to accusations by right-wing conspiracy theorists of her having ties to Satanism, Microsoft eventually pulled the advertisement. Abramović responded to the criticism, appealing to people to stop harassing her, arguing that her performances are just the art that she has been doing for the last 50 years.

== Personal life ==
Abramović claims she feels &quot;neither like a Serb, nor a Montenegrin&quot;, but an ex-Yugoslav. &quot;When people ask me where I am from,&quot; she says, &quot;I never say Serbia. I always say I come from a country that no longer exists.&quot; In February 2025, Abramović endorsed the 2024–2025 Serbian anti-corruption protests.

Abramović has had three abortions during her life, and has said that having children would have been a &quot;disaster&quot; for her work.

Sculptor Nikola Pešić says that Abramović has a lifelong interest in esotericism and Spiritualism.

<text>Earl of Burlington is a title that has been created twice, the first time in the Peerage of England in 1664 and the second in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1831. Since 1858, Earl of Burlington has been a courtesy title used by the dukes of Devonshire, traditionally borne by the duke&#x27;s grandson, who is the eldest son of the duke&#x27;s eldest son, the marquess of Hartington.

==History==

The first creation was for Richard Boyle, 2nd Earl of Cork, on 20 March 1664 (see the Earl of Cork for earlier history of the family). He had previously been created Baron Clifford of Londesborough , in the County of York, on 4 November 1644, also in the Peerage of England. Lord Burlington was the husband of Elizabeth Clifford, 2nd Baroness Clifford. Their eldest son Charles Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan, succeeded his mother as third Baron Clifford in 1691 but predeceased his father. Lord Burlington was therefore succeeded by his grandson (the son of Viscount Dungarvan), the third Earl of Cork and second Earl of Burlington. He had already succeeded his father as fourth Baron Clifford in 1694. His only son, the 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork, was the famous architect and patron. He had two daughters but no sons and on his death in 1753 the barony of Clifford of Lanesborough and earldom of Burlington became extinct. He was succeeded in the earldom of Cork by his third cousin, the fifth Earl of Orrery (see the Earl of Cork for further history of these titles).

Lord Burlington was succeeded in his Burlington estates and in the barony of Clifford (which could be passed on through female lines) by his daughter Charlotte, the sixth baroness. She was the wife of the 4th duke of Devonshire. On 10 September 1831, the earldom of Burlington was revived when their third and youngest son Lord George Cavendish was created Baron Cavendish of Keighley, in the County of York, and Earl of Burlington, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1858, his grandson, the second Earl, succeeded his first cousin once removed as seventh Duke of Devonshire. Since then, Earl of Burlington has traditionally been used as a courtesy title by the Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s grandson (Marquess of Hartington is the title used by the heir apparent). Bill Burlington has opted to remain known as Earl of Burlington instead of Marquess of Hartington as he could have done following the death of his grandfather in 2004.

<text>Margaret Dumont (born Daisy Juliette Baker; October 20, 1882 – March 6, 1965) was an American stage and film actress. She is best remembered as the comic foil to the Marx Brothers in seven of their films; Groucho Marx called her &quot;practically the fifth Marx brother.&quot;

==Early life==
Dumont was born Daisy Juliette Baker in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of William and Harriet Anna (née Harvey) Baker. Her mother was a music teacher and encouraged Daisy&#x27;s singing career from an early age.

==Career==
Dumont trained as an operatic singer and actress in her teens and began performing on stage in the US and Europe, at first under the name Daisy Dumont and later as Margaret (or Marguerite - French for Daisy) Dumont. Her theatrical debut was in &quot;Sleeping Beauty and the Beast&quot; at the Chestnut Theater in Philadelphia; in August 1902, two months before her 20th birthday, she appeared as a singer/comedian in a vaudeville act in Atlantic City. The dark-haired soubrette, described by a theater reviewer as a &quot;statuesque beauty,&quot; attracted notice later that decade for her vocal and comedic talents in &quot;The Girl Behind the Counter&quot; (1908), &quot;The Belle of Brittany&quot; (1909), and &quot;The Summer Widower&quot; (1910).

In 1910, she married millionaire sugar heir and industrialist John Moller Jr and retired from stage work, although she had a small uncredited role as an aristocrat in a 1917 film adaptation of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. The marriage was childless.

After her husband&#x27;s sudden death during the 1918 influenza pandemic, Dumont reluctantly returned to the Broadway stage, and soon gained a strong reputation in musical comedies. She never remarried. Her Broadway career included roles in the musical comedies and plays &quot;The Fan&quot; (1921), &quot;Go Easy, Mabel&quot; (1922), &quot;The Rise of Rosie O&#x27;Reilly&quot; (1923/24), and &quot;The Fourflusher&quot; (1925); she had an uncredited role in the 1923 film &quot;Enemies of Women&quot;.

===With the Marx Brothers===
In 1925, theatrical producer Sam H. Harris recommended Dumont to the Marx Brothers and writer George S. Kaufman for the role of the stuffy rich widow Mrs. Potter in the Marxes Broadway production of &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot;. In their next Broadway show, &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;, which opened in October 1928, Dumont again was cast as foil and straight woman Mrs. Rittenhouse, another wealthy, high society widow. She appeared with the Marxes in the screen versions of both &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; (1929) and &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; (1930).

In the Marx Brothers films, Dumont invariably portrayed rich widows whom Groucho would alternately insult and romance for their money:

* &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; (1929) as Mrs. Potter
* &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; (1930) as Mrs. Rittenhouse
* &quot;Duck Soup&quot; (1933) as Mrs. Gloria Teasdale
* &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1935) as Mrs. Claypool
* &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937) as Mrs. Emily Upjohn
* &quot;At the Circus&quot; (1939) as Mrs. Susanna Dukesbury
* &quot;The Big Store&quot; (1941) as Martha Phelps

Her role as the excitable, hypochondriacal Mrs. Upjohn in &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; brought her a Best Supporting Actress Award from the Screen Actors Guild; film critic Cecilia Ager suggested that a monument be erected in honor of Dumont&#x27;s courage and steadfastness in the face of the Marx Brothers&#x27; antics. Groucho once said that because of their frequent movie appearances, many people believed they were married in real life.

An exchange from &quot;Duck Soup&quot;:

:Groucho: I suppose you&#x27;ll think me a sentimental old fluff, but would you mind giving me a lock of your hair?
:Dumont: A lock of my hair? Why, I had no idea you ...
:Groucho: I&#x27;m letting you off easy. I was gonna ask for the whole wig.

Dumont also endured dialogue about her characters&#x27; (and thus her own) stout build, as with these lines also from &quot;Duck Soup&quot;:
:Dumont: I&#x27;ve sponsored your appointment because I feel you are the most able statesman in all Freedonia.
:Groucho: Well, that covers a lot of ground. Say, you cover a lot of ground yourself. You&#x27;d better beat it; I hear they&#x27;re going to tear you down and put up an office building where you&#x27;re standing.

and:

:Groucho: Why don&#x27;t you marry me?
:Dumont: Why, marry you?
:Groucho: You take me and I&#x27;ll take a vacation. I&#x27;ll need a vacation if we&#x27;re going to get married. Married! I can see you right now in the kitchen, bending over a hot stove. &quot;But I can&#x27;t see the stove.&quot;

Or her age (in their last film pairing, &quot;The Big Store&quot;):

:Dumont: ...I&#x27;m afraid after we&#x27;re married awhile, a beautiful, young girl will come along and you&#x27;ll forget all about me.
:Groucho: Don&#x27;t be silly. I&#x27;ll write you twice a week.

Dumont&#x27;s character would usually give a short, startled or confused reaction to these insults, but always appeared to forget them quickly.

In his one-man show at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall in 1972, Groucho mentioned Dumont&#x27;s name and got a burst of applause. He falsely informed the audience that she rarely understood the humor of their scenes and would ask him, &quot;Why are they laughing, Julie?&quot; (&quot;Julie&quot; being her nickname for Julius, Groucho&#x27;s birth name). Dumont was so important to the success of the Marx Brothers films, she was one of the few people Groucho mentioned in his short acceptance speech for an honorary Oscar in 1974. (The others were Harpo and Chico, their mother Minnie, and Groucho&#x27;s companion Erin Fleming. Zeppo and Gummo Marx, who were both alive at the time, were not mentioned, though Jack Lemmon, who introduced Groucho, mentioned all four brothers who appeared with Dumont on film.)

In most of her interviews and press profiles, Dumont preserved the myth of her on-screen character: the wealthy, regal woman who never quite understood the jokes. However, in a 1942 interview with the World Wide Features press syndicate, Dumont said, &quot;Scriptwriters build up to a laugh but they don&#x27;t allow any pause for it. That&#x27;s where I come in. I ad lib—it doesn&#x27;t matter what I say—just to kill a few seconds so you can enjoy the gag. I have to sense when the big laughs will come and fill in, or the audience will drown out the next gag with its own laughter. ... I&#x27;m not a stooge, I&#x27;m a straight lady. There&#x27;s an art to playing straight. You must build up your man, but never top him, never steal the laughs from him.&quot;

For decades, film critics and historians have theorized that because Dumont never broke character or smiled at Groucho&#x27;s jokes, she did not &quot;get&quot; the Marxes&#x27; humor. On the contrary, Dumont, a seasoned stage professional, maintained her &quot;straight&quot; appearance to enhance the Marxes&#x27; comedy. In 1965, shortly before Dumont&#x27;s death, &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; featured a recreation of &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding&quot; (from the Marxes&#x27; 1930 film &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;) in which Dumont can be seen laughing at Groucho&#x27;s ad-libs—proving that she got the jokes.

Writing about Dumont&#x27;s importance as a comic foil in 1998, film critic Andrew Sarris wrote &quot;Groucho&#x27;s confrontations with Miss Dumont seem much more the heart of the Marxian matter today than the rather loose rapport among the three brothers themselves.&quot;

Dumont&#x27;s acting style, especially in her early films, reflected the classic theatrical tradition of projecting to the back row (for example, trilling the &quot;r&quot; for emphasis). She had a classical operatic singing voice that screenwriters eagerly used to their advantage.

===Other roles===
Dumont appeared in 57 films, including some minor silent work beginning with &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1917). Her first feature was the Marx Brothers&#x27; &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; (1929), in which she played Mrs. Potter, the role she played in the stage version from which the film was adapted. She also made some television appearances, including a guest-starring role with Estelle Winwood on &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; in the episode &quot;Miss Lovelace Comes to Tea&quot; (1959).

Dumont, usually playing her dignified dowager character, appeared with other film comedians and actors, including Wheeler and Woolsey and George &quot;Spanky&quot; McFarland (&quot;Kentucky Kernels&quot;, 1934); Joe Penner (&quot;Here, Prince&quot; 1932, and &quot;The Life of the Party&quot; 1937); Lupe Vélez (&quot;High Flyers&quot;, 1937); W.C. Fields (&quot;Never Give a Sucker an Even Break&quot;, 1941, and &quot;Tales of Manhattan&quot; 1942); Laurel and Hardy (&quot;The Dancing Masters&quot;, 1943); Red Skelton (&quot;Bathing Beauty&quot;, 1944); Danny Kaye (&quot;Up in Arms&quot;, 1944); Jack Benny (&quot;The Horn Blows at Midnight&quot;, 1945); George &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes (&quot;Sunset in El Dorado&quot;, 1945); Abbott and Costello (&quot;Little Giant&quot;, 1946); and Tom Poston (&quot;Zotz!&quot;, 1962).

Turner Classic Movies’ website says of &quot;High Flyers&quot;: &quot;The surprise... is seeing [Dumont] play a somewhat daffy matron, more Billie Burke than typical Margaret Dumont. As the lady who&#x27;s into crystal gazing and dotes on her kleptomaniac bull terrier, she brings a discreetly screwball touch to the proceedings.&quot;

She also appeared on television with Martin and Lewis in &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; (December 1951).

Dumont played dramatic parts in films including &quot;Youth on Parole&quot; (1937), &quot;Dramatic School&quot; (1938), &quot;Stop, You&#x27;re Killing Me&quot; (1952), &quot;Three for Bedroom C&quot; (1952), and &quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Rock!&quot; (1956).

Her last film role was that of Shirley MacLaine&#x27;s mother, Mrs. Foster, in &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot; (1964).

On February 26, 1965, eight days before her death, Dumont made her final acting appearance on the television program &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, where she was reunited with Groucho, the week&#x27;s guest host. They performed material from Captain Spaulding&#x27;s introductory scene in &quot;Animal Crackers,&quot; including the song &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding.&quot; The taped show was broadcast on April 17, 1965.

==Death==
Margaret Dumont died from a heart attack on March 6, 1965. She was cremated and her ashes were interred at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles. She was 82, although many obituaries erroneously gave her age as 75.

In 2023, her remains were removed from non-public storage in the Chapel of the Pines basement after 58 years to a publicly accessible niche in the chapel columbarium.

<text>William King (17 April 1786 – 19 October 1865) was a British physician and philanthropist from Brighton. He is best known as an early supporter of the co-operative movement through the paper he founded, &quot;The Co-operator&quot;.

William King was the son of Rev. John King, a master at Ipswich School, and Elizabeth Sarah (née Bishop). One brother, John, was a writer of legal books, and another, Richard Henry was a naval officer who served under Philip Broke – a former pupil at Ipswich School – during the capture of USS Chesapeake.

King was born in Lower Brooke Street, Ipswich, Suffolk, but the family subsequently moved nearby to Witnesham when his father retired to the rectory there in 1798. He was educated at Westminster School in London, and then Peterhouse at the University of Cambridge where he obtained a BA and MA. He subsequently studied at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London and then in France in both Paris and Montpellier before returning to Peterhouse where in 1819 he graduated as a Doctor of Medicine. In 1820 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.

In 1821 he married Mary Hooker, with whom he had at least two children, and he moved to Brighton.

By 1827, Robert Owen had taken his ideas of a co-operative movement to the United States. But they were picked up and amplified by King. King founded a co-operative store in Brighton. Then in May 1828 he started a paper, &quot;The Co-operator&quot;, to promote these ideas. &quot;The Co-operator&quot; had a wide circulation and a great influence in the emerging movement. Though only published for slightly over two years, the paper served to educate and unify otherwise scattered groups. King&#x27;s articles in the paper gave the movement some philosophical and practical basis that it had lacked before.

King&#x27;s overriding rationale for the movement is best illustrated by the phrases repeated on the masthead of every issue of &quot;The Co-operator&quot;:
:&quot;Knowledge and union are power. Power, directed by knowledge is happiness. Happiness is the end of creation.&quot;
However he faced some criticism in other co-operative publications for his views on radical Owenism and stopped publishing the paper in August 1830 and distanced himself from the movement, in part because his views, including his support of Catholic emancipation, were affecting his professional reputation. However, he continued to hold his belief in co-operation and supported later co-operative endeavours.

King later worked at the Sussex County Hospital and Brighton Provident Dispensary before retiring in 1861.

King lived at 23 Montpelier Road in the Montpelier area of Brighton where he died on 19 October 1865 due to a heart condition. He was buried at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, the parish church of Hove.

<text>Idol is a television show on the Polish television network Polsat, based on the popular British show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. The show is a contest to determine the best young singer in Poland. It is hosted by Maciej Rock.

In the show, people first audition but eventually the performers are narrowed down to 10 finalists, with each contestant performing live. There are four judges (or five) who provide critiques of each competitor&#x27;s performance.

Viewers have two hours following the broadcast of the show to vote via telephone and SMS for their favorite contestant. On the night&#x27;s results episode, the contestant with the fewest votes is sent home.

The winners of Idol were Alicja Janosz in season one, Krzysztof Zalewski in season two, Monika Brodka in season three &amp; Maciek Silski in season four.

After a hiatus of 12 years, the show returned for its 5th season in 2017. The winner is Mariusz Dyba.

<doc id="467649" wikidata="Q253172" url="?curid=467649" title="HACEK organisms">
<text>The HACEK organisms are a group of fastidious Gram-negative bacteria that are an unusual cause of infective endocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart due to bacterial infection. HACEK is an abbreviation of the initials of the genera of this group of bacteria: &quot;Haemophilus&quot;, &quot;Aggregatibacter&quot; (previously &quot;Actinobacillus&quot;), &quot;Cardiobacterium&quot;, &quot;Eikenella&quot;, &quot;Kingella&quot;. The HACEK organisms are a normal part of the human microbiota, living in the oral-pharyngeal region.

The bacteria were originally grouped because they were thought to be a significant cause of infective endocarditis, but recent research has shown that they are rare and only responsible for 1.4–3.0% of all cases of this disease.

==Organisms==
HACEK originally referred to &quot;Haemophilus parainfluenzae&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus aphrophilus&quot;, &quot;Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans&quot;, &quot;Cardiobacterium hominis&quot;, &quot;Eikenella corrodens&quot;, and &quot;Kingella kingae&quot;. However, taxonomic rearrangements have changed the A to &quot;Aggregatibacter&quot; species and the H to &quot;Haemophilus&quot; species to reflect the recategorization and novel identification of many of the species in these genera. Some reviews of medical literature on HACEK organisms use the older classification, but recent papers are using the new classification.

A list of HACEK organisms:
*&quot;Haemophilus &quot;species
**&quot;Haemophilus haemolyticus&quot;
**&quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;: The incidence of endocarditis due to &quot;H. influenzae&quot; declined after the introduction of the Hib vaccine.
**&quot;Haemophilus parahaemolyticus&quot;
**&quot;Haemophilus parainfluenzae&quot;

*&quot;Aggregatibacter&quot;
**&quot;Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans&quot; (previously &quot;Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans&quot;)
**&quot;Aggregatibacter aphrophilus&quot; (previously &quot;Haemophilus aphrophilus&quot;)
**&quot;Aggregatibacter paraphrophilus&quot; (previously &quot;Haemophilus aphrophilus&quot;)
**&quot;Aggregatibacter segnis&quot;

*&quot;Cardiobacterium&quot;
**&quot;Cardiobacterium hominis&quot;: This is the most common species in the genus &quot;Cardiobacterium&quot;.
**&quot;Cardiobacterium valvarum&quot;

*&quot;Eikenella&quot;
**&quot;Eikenella corrodens&quot;

*&quot;Kingella&quot;
**&quot;Kingella denitrificans&quot;
**&quot;Kingella kingae&quot;: This is the most common species in the genus &quot;Kingella&quot;.

==Presentation==
All of these organisms are part of the normal oropharyngeal flora, which grow slowly (up to 14 days), prefer a carbon dioxide–enriched atmosphere, and share an enhanced capacity to produce endocardial infections, especially in young children. Collectively, they account for 5–10% of cases of infective endocarditis involving native valves and are the most common Gram-negative cause of endocarditis among people who do not use drugs intravenously. They have been a frequent cause of culture-negative endocarditis. Culture-negative refers to an inability to produce a colony on regular agar plates because these bacteria are fastidious (require a specific nutrient).

In addition to valvular infections in the heart, they can also produce other infections, such as bacteremia, abscess, peritonitis, otitis media, conjunctivitis, pneumonia, arthritis, osteomyelitis, and periodontal infections.

==Treatment==
The treatment of choice for HACEK organisms in endocarditis is the third-generation cephalosporin and β-Lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone. Ampicillin (a penicillin), combined with low-dose gentamicin (an aminoglycoside) is another therapeutic option.

<text>Comorian (&quot;Shikomori&quot;, or &quot;Shimasiwa&quot;, the &quot;language of islands&quot;) is the name given to a group of four Bantu languages spoken in the Comoro Islands, an archipelago in the southwestern Indian Ocean between Mozambique and Madagascar. It is named as one of the official languages of the Union of the Comoros in the Comorian constitution. Shimaore, one of the languages, is spoken on the disputed island of Mayotte, a French department claimed by Comoros.

Like Swahili, the Comorian languages are Sabaki languages, part of the Bantu language family. Each island has its own language, and the four are conventionally divided into two groups: the eastern group is composed of &quot;Shindzuani&quot; (spoken on Ndzuani) and &quot;Shimaore&quot; (Mayotte), while the western group is composed of &quot;Shimwali&quot; (Mwali) and &quot;Shingazija&quot; (Ngazidja). Although the languages of different groups are not usually mutually intelligible, only sharing about 80% of their lexicon, there is mutual intelligibility between the languages within each group, suggesting that Shikomori should be considered as two language groups, each including two languages, rather than four distinct languages.

Historically, the language was written in the Arabic-based Ajami script. The French colonial administration introduced the Latin script. In 2009 the current independent government decreed a modified version of the Latin script for official use. Many Comorians now use the Latin script when writing the Comorian language although the Ajami script is still widely used, especially by women. Recently, some scholars have suggested that the language may be on its way to endangerment, citing the unstable code-switching and numerous French words used in daily speech.

It is the language of &quot;Umodja wa Masiwa,&quot; the national anthem.

== History and classification ==
The first Bantu speakers arrived at the Comoros sometime between the 5th and 10th centuries, before the Shirazi Arabs.

=== Shimwali ===
The Shimwali dialect was possibly one of the earliest Bantu languages to be recorded by a European. On July 3, 1613, Walter Payton claimed to have recorded 14 words on the island of Moheli, stating &quot;They speak a kind of Morisco language.&quot; Sir Thomas Roe and Thomas Herbert also claimed to have recorded vocabulary.

Until the 1970s, it was regarded as a dialect or archaic form of Swahili. This was first proposed in 1871, when Kersten suggested it might be a mixture of Shingazija, Swahili, and Malagasy. In 1919 Johnston, referring to it as &#x27;Komoro Islands Swahili - the dialect of &#x27;Mohila&#x27; and &#x27;the &#x27;Mohella&#x27; language&#x27;, suggested that, taken together with the other two dialects in the Comoros, it might be an ancient and corrupt form of Swahili. However, Ottenheimer et al. (1976) found this to not be the case. Instead, they classify Shimwali, as well as the other Comorian languages, as a separate language group from Swahili.

=== Shinzwani ===
Shinzwani was first noted by a South African missionary Reverend William Elliott in 1821 and 1822. During a 13-months&#x27; mission stay on the island of Anjouan he compiled a vocabulary and grammar of the language. Elliott included a 900-word vocabulary and provided 98 sample sentences in Shinzwani. He does not appear to have recognized noun- classes (of which there are at least six in Shinzwani) nor does he appear to have considered Shinzwani a Bantu language, only making a superficial connection to Swahili.

The dialect was noted again in 1841 by Casalis, who placed it within Bantu, and by Peters, who collected a short word list. In 1875 Hildebrandt published a Shinzwani vocabulary and suggested in 1876 that Shinzwani was an older form of Swahili.

The idea of the distinctness of Shingazija and Shinzwani from Swahili finally gained prominence during the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th century. In 1883, an analysis by Gust distinguished Shinzwani from Swahili. He discusses Shinzwani and Swahili as two separate languages which had contributed to the port-language which he referred to as Barracoon.

In 1909 two publications reaffirmed and clarified the distinctiveness of Shinzwani, Shingazija and Swahili. Struck published a word list which appeared to have been recorded by a Frenchman in Anjouan in 1856, identified the words as belonging to Shinzwani and noted some influence from Swahili.

In his Swahili Grammar, Sacleux cautioned that although Swahili was spoken in the Comoros it must not be confused with the native languages of the Comoros, Shinzwani and Shingazija. He said that while Swahili was mostly spoken in cities, the Comorian languages were widely spoken in the countryside.

=== Shingazija ===
Shingazija was not documented until 1869 when Bishop Edward Steere collected a word list and commented that he did not know which language family it belonged to. In 1870 Gevrey characterized both Shingazija and Shinzwani as the &#x27;Souaheli des Comores&#x27; (Swahili of the Comoros) which was only a &#x27;patois de celui de Zanzibar&#x27;. However, Kersten noted in 1871 that Shingazija was not at all like Swahili but was a separate Bantu language.

Torrend was the first to identify the difference between Shingazija and Shinzwani in 1891. He attempted to account for Shingazija by suggesting that it was a mixture of Shinzwani and Swahili.

==Phonology==
The consonants and vowels in the Comorian languages: 
=== Vowels ===
=== Consonants ===
The consonants &quot;mb&quot;, &quot;nd&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot; are phonemically implosives, but may also be phonetically recognized as ranging from implosives to voiced stops as , , , . A glottal stop can also be heard when in between vowels. 

In the Shimaore dialect, if when inserting a prefix the leading consonant becomes intervocalic, becomes , becomes , becomes , becomes , and is deleted.

There is a preference for multi-syllable words and a CV syllable structures. Vowels are frequently deleted and inserted to better fit the CV structure. There is also an alternate strategy of &quot;h&quot;-insertion in scenarios which would otherwise results in VV. 

There is a strong preference for penultimate stress. There was previously a tone system in the language, but it has been mostly phased out and no longer plays an active role in the majority of cases.

== Orthography ==

Comorian is most commonly written in Latin alphabet today. Traditionally and historically, Arabic alphabet is used as well but to a lesser extent. Arabic alphabet has been universally known in Comoros, due to the fact that there was a near universal attendance at Quranic schools on the islands, whereas knowledge and literacy in French was lacking. Since independence from France, the situation has changed, with improvements to infrastructure of secular education, in which French is the language of instruction.

=== Latin alphabet ===


Note: In Shimaore, the digraphs &quot; vh &quot; and &quot; bv &quot; are used for representing the phoneme .
=== Arabic alphabet ===

Comoros being located near the East African coast, the archipelago being connected by deep trade links to the mainland, and Comorian being a Bantu language much like Swahili language, means that historically, the Arabic orthography of Comorian followed the Swahili suit in being part of the tradition of the African Ajami script. Key components of the Ajami tradition are mainly that vowels were always represented with diacritics (thus differing from Persian conventions). The letters &quot;alif&quot; , &quot;wāw&quot; , and &quot;yāʼ&quot; were used for indicating stressed syllable or long vowels. Furthermore, whereas Bantu languages have 5 vowels, while Arabic has 3 vowels and 3 diacritics; until recently, specifically until the early 20th century, there hasn&#x27;t been an agreed upon way of writing the vowels and . Furthermore, sounds unique to Bantu languages were generally shown with the closest matching letter in the Arabic alphabet, avoiding as much as possible the creation of new letters in order not to deviate from the authentic 28-letter base. In addition, prenasalized consonants were shown using digraphs.

The 20th century marked the start of a process of orthographic reform and standardization across the Muslim world. This process included standardizing, unifying, and clarifying the Arabic script in most places, ditching the Arabic script in favour of Latin or Cyrillic in others in places such as Soviet Turkistan and Soviet Caucasus, to Turkey and Kurdistan, to the Eastern African coast (Swahili Ajami) and Comoros.

The mantle of standardization and improvement of Arabic-based orthography in Comoros was carried by the literaturist &quot;Said Kamar-Eddine (1890-1974)&quot; in 1960. Only two decades before, in 1930s and 1940s, Swahili literaturists such as &quot;Sheikh el Amin&quot; and &quot;Sheikh Yahya Ali Omar&quot; had developed the Swahili Arabic alphabet as well.

In Swahili, two new diacritics were added to the 3 original diacritics, namely to represent the phoneme , and to represent the phoneme . Furthermore, the usage of the 3 mater lectionis (or vowel carrier letters) followed the following convention too: Vowels in stressed () syllable of the word are marked with diacritic as well as a carrier letter, namely &quot;alif&quot; for vowel , &quot;yāʼ&quot; for vowels and , and &quot;wāw&quot; for vowels and .

But, in the proposal by &quot;Said Kamar-Eddine&quot; for Comorian, there was a departure from the Ajami tradition and a divergence from what was done by Swahili literaturists. &quot;Kamar-Eddine&quot; had an eye on Iraqi and Iranian Kurdistan, and the orthographic reforms implemented there. In Kurdish, the direction of the reforms of the alphabet favoured elimination of all diacriticts and designating specific letters to each and every vowel sound, thus creating a full &quot;alphabet&quot;. Kurdish orthography wasn&#x27;t unique in this regard. A similar direction was pursued in various Turkic languages such as Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Uyghur, and Kazakh, as well as languages of the Caucasus such as Western and Eastern Circassian languages and Chechen language. This makes &quot;Said Kamar-Eddine&quot; orthography for Comorian, a unique case for Sub-saharan African languages that have been written with the Arabic script.

In the initial position, the vowels are written as a single letter. No preceding &quot;alif&quot; or &quot;hamza&quot; is required. (This is similar to the convention of Kazakh Arabic alphabet)

In Kurdish, new vowel letters were created by adding accents on existing letters. The phonemes and are written with and respectively. In Comorian, new independent letters were assigned instead. The letter &quot;hāʾ&quot; in two of its variants are used for both aforementioned phonemes. A standard Arabic &quot;hāʾ&quot;, in all its 4 positional shapes () is used for the vowel . This is a unique innovation exclusive to this orthography. The letter &quot;hāʾ&quot; in these shapes is not used as vowel in any other Arabic orthography. A letter &quot;hāʾ&quot;, in a fixed &quot;medial&quot; zigzag shape (medial form of what&#x27;s known in Urdu as gol he) () is used for the vowel . The usage of this variant of the letter &quot;hāʾ&quot; as a vowel is not unique to Comorian. In the early 20th century, West and East Circassian Arabic orthography also used this variant of the letter &quot;hāʾ&quot; to represent the vowel (written as &quot;ы&quot; in Cyrillic).

Letters representing consonant phonemes that are not present in Arabic have been formed in either of the two following methods. First method is similar to Persian and Kurdish, where new letters are created by adding or modifying of dots. The second method is to use the Arabic gemination diacritic &quot;Shaddah&quot; on letters that are most similar to the missing consonant phoneme. This is similar to the tradition of Sorabe (Arabo-Malagasy) orthograhpy, where a geminated &quot;r&quot; () is meant to represent or , and where a geminated &quot;f&quot; () is meant to represent or .

There are two types of vowel sequencees in Comorian, a glide or a vowel hiatus. Latin letters &quot;w&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, represented by and , are considered semivowels. When these letters follow another vowel, they are written sequentially.

Other succession of vowels are treated as &quot;vowel hiatus&quot;. In these instances, a &quot;hamza&quot; () is written in between.

Prenasalized consonants are written as digraphs, with either &quot;m&quot; () or &quot;n&quot; ().

&quot;Comorian Arabic (Kamar-Eddine&#x27;s) Alphabet&quot;:

== Grammar ==

=== Noun class ===
As in other Bantu languages, Shikomor displays a noun class/gender system in which classes share a prefix. Classes 1 through 10 generally have singular/plural pairings.

Classes 9 &amp; 10 consists mainly of borrowed words, such as &quot;dipe&quot; (from French &quot;du pain&quot; &#x27;some bread&#x27;) and do not take prefixes. Class 7 &amp; 8 and class 9 &amp; 10 take on the same agreements in adjectives and verbs. Class 10a contains a very small amount of words, generally plurals of Class 11. Class 15 consists of verbal infinitives, much like English gerunds. 

Class 16 contains only two words, &quot;vahana&quot; and &quot;vahali&quot;, both meaning &#x27;place&#x27;. It was probably borrowed from Swahili &quot;pahali&quot;, which was borrowed from Arabic &quot;mahal&quot;. Class 17 consists of locatives with the prefix &quot;ha-&quot;, and Class 18 consists of locatives with the prefix &quot;mwa-.&quot;

=== Numerals ===
Numerals in Comorian follow the noun. If the number is 1 through 5 or 8, it must agree with the class of its noun.
=== Demonstratives ===
There are three demonstratives: One that refers to a proximate object, a non-proximate object, and an object that was previously mentioned in the conversation.

=== Possessives ===
The possessive element -&quot;a&quot; agrees with the possessed noun. The general order of a possessive construction is possessed-&quot;Ca&quot;-possessor.
=== Verbs ===
Comorian languages exhibit a typical Bantu verb structure. 

Although there is only one form of the subject marker for personal plural subjects and for subjects belonging to the classes 3-18.

In Proto-Sabaki, the 2sg and 2sg subject markers were &quot;*ku&quot; and *&quot;ka&quot;, respectively. However, the &quot;*k&quot; was weakened to &quot;h&quot; in Shingazija and further to &quot;Ø&quot; in all other dialects. 

Verbs can be negated by adding the prefix &quot;ka-&quot;. However, occasionally other morphemes of the verb may take on different meanings when the negative prefix is added, such as in the following example, where the suffix &quot;-i&quot;, usually the past tense, takes on the present habitual meaning when it is in a negative construction.
The present progressive uses the prefix si-/su-, the future tense uses tso-, and the conditional uses a-tso-.There are two past tense constructions in Comorian. The first of these is the simple past tense, which uses the structure SM-Root-Suffix 1. 

The second is the compound past, using the structure SM-&quot;ka&quot; SM-Root-Suffix 1.

<doc id="467663" wikidata="Q311467" url="?curid=467663" title="Ronan Keating">
<text>Ronan Patrick John Keating (born 3 March 1977) is an Irish singer, songwriter, actor and television and radio presenter. He debuted in 1993 alongside Keith Duffy, Michael Graham, Shane Lynch, and Stephen Gately, as the co-lead singer (with Gately) of Irish pop group Boyzone. His solo career started in 1999 and he has recorded eleven albums. He gained worldwide attention when his single &quot;When You Say Nothing At All&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Notting Hill&quot; and reached number one in several countries.

As a solo artist, Keating has sold over 20 million records worldwide alongside the 25 million records with Boyzone. In Australia, he is best known as a judge on &quot;All Together Now&quot; (2018), &quot;The X Factor&quot; (2010–14), and as a coach on &quot;The Voice Australia&quot; (2016, 2025). He has also served as a coach on &quot;The Voice Kids UK&quot; (2022–23) and &quot;The Voice of Germany&quot; (2023). He hosted a breakfast show on Magic Radio for seven years, ending in July 2024. Keating is active in charity work and has been a charity campaigner for the Marie Keating Foundation, which raises awareness for breast cancer and is named after his mother, who died from the disease in 1998.

==Early life==
Keating was born on 3 March 1977, the youngest of five children. He grew up in Bayside in Kilbarrack, County Dublin, and in County Meath, attending St. Fintan&#x27;s High School. His father, Gerry Keating, was a lorry driver; his mother Marie was a mobile hairdresser. He has one sister: Linda, and three brothers: Ciarán, Gerard and Gary. He competed in track and field, winning the All Ireland under-13 200 m title.

==Career==
===1993–1999: Boyzone===
In 1993, the then 16-year-old Ronan Keating was the youngest member to join Boyzone. Keating, Keith Duffy, Richard Rock, Shane Lynch, Mark Walton and Stephen Gately were chosen as Boyzone members. Walton and Rock would later leave the group before being replaced by Michael Graham. The group performed in various clubs and pubs before being signed by PolyGram in 1994 and released a cover version of &quot;Working My Way Back to You&quot; by The Four Seasons. The group also released a cover version of &quot;Love Me for a Reason&quot; which would peak on several charts. In 1998, his mother died at the age of 51 from breast cancer, resulting in the establishment of the Marie Keating Foundation.

At the age of 21 years, Keating married Yvonne Connolly in April 1998 and together, the couple have three children: Jack (born 15 March 1999), Marie (born 18 February 2001) and Ali (born 7 September 2005). The couple divorced after Keating had an affair.

From 1994 to 1999, Boyzone released 17 singles, 3 studio albums and 1 compilation album before disbanding in 2000 selling 27 million records and 3 million records from 4 singles, 1 compilation and studio album since their reformation.

=== 1999–2006: &quot;Ronan&quot;, &quot;Destination&quot;, &quot;Turn It On&quot; and &quot;Bring You Home&quot; ===

In 1999, while still a member of Boyzone, Keating recorded a version of &quot;When You Say Nothing at All&quot; for the motion picture &quot;Notting Hill&quot;. The single peaked at number one in the UK charts, leading to a successful solo career. Keating released his debut solo album, titled &quot;Ronan&quot;, in 2000, which peaked at number one in the UK Albums Chart. The album was given several negative reviews, although it sold over 750,000 copies and became one of the top selling albums of the year in the United Kingdom. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, and has been certified four-times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry for sales of 1.2 million copies. In the singer&#x27;s native Ireland, the album debuted at number two. The album also became a commercial success in other European countries, where it charted within the top ten of eight countries. In 2001, &quot;Ronan&quot; was certified two-times platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry for shipments of two million copies inside Europe.

The album produced four UK and Irish top-ten singles: &quot;When You Say Nothing at All&quot; (originally recorded for the soundtrack of the 1999 film &quot;Notting Hill&quot;), &quot;Life Is a Rollercoaster&quot;, &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;, and &quot;Lovin&#x27; Each Day&quot;, the latter of which was featured on the re-release edition of the album, and later on Keating&#x27;s second album, &quot;Destination&quot; (2002). Also the song &quot;Lovin each day&quot; is from a movie &quot;Summer catch&quot;.

After the successful debut album &quot;Ronan&quot; Keating continued on with his solo career and has since released four more studio albums: &quot;Destination&quot; (2002), &quot;Turn It On&quot; (2003), &quot;10 Years of Hits&quot; (2004) and &quot;Bring You Home&quot; (2006), four of which peaked at number one in the UK Albums Chart. Keating collaborated with several major stars, including Elton John, Lulu, LeAnn Rimes and the Bee Gees, for these albums.

Keating and Paul Brady co-wrote the 2001 hit single &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;, one of Keating&#x27;s most loved hits amongst fans and a huge hit for Brooks &amp; Dunn in the United States. Keating and Brady won the &quot;BMI European song-writing award&quot; for the single. In 2003, Keating was named Rear of the Year – an award given to celebrities with a notable posterior. In October 2007, Keating was listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; for being the only artist ever to have 30 consecutive top 10 singles in the UK chart, beating the likes of Elvis Presley. Keating also embarked on two world tours, won the Ivor Novello and BMI songwriting awards, released an autobiography, had a role as ambassador for Christian Aid and had sales in excess of 22 million albums worldwide. In 2007 he released two fragrances, based on Sicilian lemon, lavender and Clary sage smells. All proceeds go to the Marie Keating foundation.

Keating performed at the 2006 FIFA World Cup opening party at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany, in front of an audience of nearly 250,000 people, and posed nude for Cosmopolitan magazine&#x27;s 10 Years of Naked Centrefolds. On 9 May 2007, Keating became the first international number-one selling foreign artist to perform a concert in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Keating also performed at the Olympic Stadium Indoor Arena. Keating has performed duets with Elton John at Madison Garden in New York and has sung for the Pope twice and performed for Prince Charles at the Prince&#x27;s Trust 30th birthday, which took place at the Tower of London. He performed on stage for the Swedish Royal family at Crown Princess Victoria&#x27;s birthday celebrations, and at the opening ceremony of the 19th European Athletics Championships in Gothenburg.

===2007–2010: Boyzone reformation, &quot;Songs for My Mother&quot; and &quot;Winter Songs&quot; ===

On 5 November 2007, Keating confirmed that Boyzone would reunite for a special appearance on the BBC&#x27;s annual fundraiser, Children in Need, performing a medley of hits, although had not yet commented on the possibility of a new tour or album. Soon, they went on a 29-date tour, taking in cities such as Cardiff, Newcastle, Liverpool, London at the O2 Arena and Wembley, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Sheffield, Newcastle, Nottingham, Edinburgh Castle and the RDS in Dublin. A greatest hits collection was released and two new singles in 2008 selling 700,000 copies. Stephen Gately, a close friend and bandmate of Keating, died on 10 October 2009 of a pulmonary edema.

In 2009, Keating co-wrote the song &quot;Believe Again&quot; sung by Niels Brinck, who won the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix and represented Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow where it qualified for the final from the second semi-final and finished in 13th place with 74 points. Following the success of the album &quot;Songs for My Mother&quot;, he has recorded another entitled &quot;Winter Songs&quot;. Teaming up again with &quot;Songs for My Mother&quot; producer Steve Lipson, Keating pulled together eleven songs that evoked memories of winter and Christmas for him. &quot;Winter Songs&quot; is a mix of traditional and modern festive classics, including tracks from artists such as Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Joni Mitchell and Sugarland along with perennials &quot;Silent Night&quot; and &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;. The album also includes two new songs, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Christmas&quot; and &quot;Scars&quot;.

In March 2010, the new Boyzone album &quot;Brother&quot; was released and went to number one in the UK and Ireland selling 500,000 copies with very little promotion to add to the singles which sold 175,000 copies. On 12 November 2010, Keating released his seventh studio album, entitled &quot;Duet&quot;, in Australia and New Zealand. &quot;Believe Again&quot; was released as the lead single from the album and features guest vocals from Australian singer, Paulini.

===2010–2015: &quot;The X Factor&quot;, &quot;Duet&quot;, &quot;When Ronan Met Burt&quot; and &quot;Fires&quot; ===

Keating joined the judging panel of &quot;The X Factor&quot; in 2010, where he remained for five seasons. He was the winning mentor on two occasions; in 2010 with Altiyan Childs and in 2014 with Marlisa Punzalan. He joined Boyzone on their tour of the UK and Ireland during February and March 2011 with a 21 date tour of the Ireland and UK with their arena-based Brother Tour, each of the band members received £1 million from it.

In July 2012 he visited Malta and performed with Maltese tenor Joseph Calleja and Italian pop-singer Gigi D&#x27;Alessio. He later joined his management for dinner at Palazzo Parisio.

His ninth studio album named &quot;Fires&quot; (the fifth to contain original material) was released on 3 September 2012 in the UK and 30 August in Ireland, Germany, Australia and worldwide. It was released through Universal Music and was produced by Greg Wells and co-written by Keating and Gregg Alexander.

Boyzone reunited in 2013 to celebrate their 20th anniversary as a group. Keating said in February 2012, &quot;Next year Boyzone will be 20 years gone, so we&#x27;ll be doing something. We have plans to get various other artists in the mix as well, I know Rizzle Kicks are interested and I have plans to get my nephew Will on a track somewhere in the album&quot; The new Boyzone album, &quot;BZ20&quot;, was released in the summer of 2013. It featured ten new songs and ten re-recorded songs, with two singles. In September 2013, Keating teamed up with &quot;X Factor&quot; judge Dannii Minogue to record a duet of Christmas classic &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming To Town&quot; for department store chain Myer&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of Christmas 2013&quot; compilation.

In April 2011, Keating began working on &quot;Goddess&quot;, a 2013 romantic comedy film co-starring British actress Laura Michelle Kelly.

Keating ran in the London Marathon on 13 April 2008 to raise money for Cancer Research, with a personal best time of 3hr 59min. He has also walked the length of Ireland twice, each time raising money for the Marie Keating Foundation, now linked to Cancer Research in the UK. Each year the foundation holds charity balls and various events, raising funds to keep their mobile units on the road.

==Feud with Louis Walsh==
When Keating announced he wanted to take a break from Boyzone, Louis Walsh continued to manage his career. Keating achieved a number one hit with &quot;Life is a Rollercoaster&quot; in 2000 while his album sold 4.4 million copies. Keating and Walsh later agreed to part company and then had a bitter falling out.
Walsh told the press: &quot;[Keating] wasn&#x27;t the most talented one – he&#x27;s not a great singer and he&#x27;s got no personality.&quot;
Keating later told &quot;Closer&quot; magazine: &quot;That man absolutely tried to ruin me and if he thinks we can ever hug and make up he can forget it. I haven&#x27;t heard from him in three years and I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem if I never saw him again. He&#x27;s not a nice character.&quot;

The feud between the two men had apparently ended by March 2008, after which Keating helped in selecting the finalists in the groups category in &quot;The X Factor&quot;. However, by the time Boyzone celebrated their 20th anniversary in 2013, Walsh had stopped managing the group, claiming his tenure as manager had ended &quot;badly&quot;.

==Personal life==

<text>Idols was a television show on the Dutch television network RTL 4, which is part of the Idols series based on the popular British show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. The show is a contest to determine the best young singer in the Netherlands.

The show is divided in two sections, the first being the audition round, an open audition where everyone who wants to try is allowed to sing. The first couple of shows usually show the worst and the best contenders in these auditions. Once the best are selected, the theater round starts. Here the singers who survived the auditions have to prove they really have what it takes to become an idol. In a couple of shows these performers are narrowed down to just 10 finalists, with each contestant performing live.

In the first 2 seasons there were four judges, but starting with season 3 there are just three. The judges provide critiques of each competitor&#x27;s performance and determine nine of the ten people who enter the final shows. In the final shows they just comment, but don&#x27;t have any power anymore. After the first part of the show viewers have around one hour to vote by telephone and text messages to vote for their favorite contestant, later in the night the results of &#x27;Idols&#x27; starts in which the results are presented and the contestant with the fewest votes is sent home.

On 5 November the Dutch broadcaster RTL announced a fifth season which will be broadcast on RTL 5 in 2016.

==Season 1==
Auditions began in 2002 and were held Zeist, Eindhoven, Hoofddorp, Rotterdam and Assen. 7,626 people auditioned in the debut season.

94 successful auditionees progressed to the next stage at the TheaterHotel De Oranjerie in Roermond, Limburg. In a chorus line of ten, contestants re-audition with a self-chosen song. 50 contestants made the second day of the theatre round where groups based on gender were formed to sing one pre-determined song: &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Lovely?&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m So Excited&quot; , for the males and females respectively.

===Semi Final Qualifyings===
From this stage, all shows are broadcast live from Studio 22 in Hilversum.

==Season 5==
Auditions began in January 2016 and were held Novotel Schiphol Airport in Hoofddorp. The first audition show attracted a record-breaking 1.5 million viewers.

93 contestants progressed to the next stage at Theater de Kom in Nieuwegein, Utrecht. In a chorus line of ten, contestants re-audition with a pre-selected song. The songs were &quot;Stay with Me&quot; by Sam Smith, &quot;Chandelier&quot; by Sia, &quot;Stitches&quot; by Shawn Mendes, and &quot;Hello&quot; by Adele. 35 contestants advanced to the second theatre round where groups of three or four had to perform a pre-determined song, either &quot;Marvin Gaye&quot; by Charlie Puth ft. Meghan Trainor, &quot;Never Forget You&quot; by MNEK &amp; Zara Larsson or &quot;Sexy als ik dans&quot; by Nielson. Twenty contestants progressed to the next stage.

The next round took place on Bali. First, the contestants had to perform a duet. Half of the contestants were eliminated. The remaining ten entered an acoustic piano round in which they performed a song of their choice. Two more contestants were sent home, narrowing the number of contestants down to eight that will enter the live shows.

During each live show, two contestants were sent home until two finalists remained. These two finalists faced off in a final during which viewers at home could cast their vote.

<doc id="467668" wikidata="Q295218" url="?curid=467668" title="Satoshi Tajiri">
<text>is a Japanese video game designer and director who is the creator of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise and the co-founder and president of video game developer Game Freak.

A fan of arcade games in his youth, Tajiri wrote for and edited his own video gaming fanzine &quot;Game Freak&quot; with Ken Sugimori, before evolving it into a development company of the same name. Tajiri claims that the joining of two Game Boys via a link cable inspired him to create a game which embodied the collection and companionship of his childhood hobby, insect collecting. The game, which became &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Green&quot;, took six years to complete and went on to spark a multibillion-dollar franchise which reinvigorated Nintendo&#x27;s handheld gaming scene. Tajiri continued to work as director for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series until the development of &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, when he changed his role to executive producer, which he holds to this day.

Tajiri has also worked for other Game Freak projects. He was also an executive producer on the live-action film &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot;.

== Early life ==

Satoshi Tajiri was born on August 28, 1965, in Setagaya, Tokyo. Tajiri grew up in Machida, Tokyo, which at the time still maintained a rural atmosphere and was rapidly growing. As a child, Tajiri enjoyed insect collecting as a hobby, which would be an inspiration for his later video game work. Other children called him &quot;Dr. Bug&quot;, and he wanted to become an entomologist. As urban areas of Japan spread and more land was paved over, habitats for hunting bugs were lost. Tajiri wanted his games to allow children to have the feeling of catching and collecting creatures as he had.

He became fascinated with arcade games as a teenager, though his parents thought he was a delinquent for this pastime. He particularly enjoyed playing Taito&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978), which drew him into other video games. &quot;Space Invaders&quot; got him interested in video games; after playing &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and its video game clones, he wanted to make his own sequel to &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. He was also inspired by Namco games designed around a single specific action, notably &quot;Dig Dug&quot; (1982). His interest eventually evolved into attempting to plan his own games. He took his Famicom apart to see how it worked, and won a contest for a video game idea sponsored by Sega.

Because of his fascination with video games, Tajiri frequently cut classes. He took make-up classes and eventually earned his high school diploma. Tajiri did not attend university, but instead attended a two-year technical degree program at the National Institute of Technology, Tokyo College, where he majored in electronics and computer science.

==Career==
Tajiri wrote and edited a fanzine called &quot;Game Freak&quot; from 1981 to 1986, focusing on the arcade game scene. It was handwritten and stapled together. Satoshi created the &quot;Game Freak&quot; fanzine to help gamers with winning strategies and lists of easter eggs. The highest selling issue, at more than 10,000 copies, details how to get a high score in &quot;Xevious&quot;. Ken Sugimori, who later illustrated the first 151 Pokémon, saw the magazine at a dōjinshi shop, and became its illustrator. As more contributors came to &quot;Game Freak&quot;, Tajiri began to realize that most games were lacking in quality, and he and Sugimori decided the solution was to make their own games. Tajiri studied the &quot;Family BASIC&quot; game programming package, to better grasp the concepts of Famicom game design. He then purchased the requisite hardware for game development. Tajiri and Sugimori evolved the magazine into the video game development company Game Freak in 1989. Soon after, the two pitched their first game, an arcade-style game called &quot;Quinty&quot;, to Namco, who published the game. Tajiri also wrote as a freelance writer for the magazine &quot;Famicom Hisshōbon&quot;, later called &quot;Hippon&quot;, and reviewed arcade games for &quot;Family Computer Magazine&quot; and &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot;.

Tajiri first conceived the idea of &quot;Pokémon&quot; in 1990. The idea came together after he saw a Game Boy and the ability to communicate between Game Boys, and Tajiri decided &quot;Pokémon&quot; made the most sense on the handheld console. When he thought about the link cable being able to interact with two Game Boys, he envisioned bugs crawling back and forth, recalling his childhood love of bug collecting. Tajiri advanced the connectivity between handheld game consoles beyond &quot;Tetris&quot; style competition, by suggesting that Game Boys could use their link cables to trade collectibles.

When he first pitched the idea of &quot;Pokémon&quot; to Nintendo staff, they could not quite grasp the concept, but were impressed enough with Tajiri&#x27;s game design reputation that they decided to explore it. Shigeru Miyamoto began to mentor Tajiri, guiding him during the creation process. &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; took six years to produce, and nearly bankrupted Game Freak in the process; often, there was barely enough money to pay the employees. Five employees quit, and Tajiri did not take a salary, instead living off of his father&#x27;s income. Investment from Creatures Inc. allowed Game Freak to complete the games, and in return, Creatures received one-third of the franchise rights.

Between the approval and completion stages of the project, Tajiri assisted in the design of two &quot;Mario&quot; spin-off games for Nintendo: &quot;Yoshi&quot; and the Japanese-only release &quot;Mario &amp; Wario&quot;. He also worked on 1994&#x27;s &quot;Pulseman&quot; for Sega.

Once the games were completed, very few media outlets gave it attention, believing the Game Boy was a dead console; a general lack of interest of merchandising convinced Tajiri that Nintendo would reject the games. The &quot;Pokémon&quot; games were not expected to do well, but sales steadily increased until the series found itself among Nintendo&#x27;s top franchises. Rumors of a hidden Pokémon creature named Mew, which could only be obtained by exploiting programming errors, increased interest in the game. Tajiri had included Mew in the game in order to promote trading and interaction between players, but Nintendo was not aware of the creature upon release. The franchise helped Nintendo&#x27;s waning sales. Tajiri deliberately toned down violence in his games. In this vein, he designed Pokémon creatures to faint rather than die upon their defeat, as he believed it was unhealthy for children to equate the concept of death with losing a game. After the completion and release of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; in Japan, Tajiri later worked on 1997&#x27;s &quot;Bushi Seiryūden: Futari no Yūsha.&quot; Tajiri continues to be involved in the more modern &quot;Pokémon&quot; games as well. For &quot;Pokémon FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot;, he supervised the process from start to finish and approved all the text. While developing games, Tajiri works irregular hours, often laboring 24 hours at a time and resting 12 hours.

===Inspirations===
Tajiri cites Shigeru Miyamoto as a major influence, thinking of him as a sort of mentor. For this reason, his developmental style closely matches that of Miyamoto. In the Japanese version of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime, the main character is named Satoshi (Ash Ketchum in the English version), and his rival is Shigeru (Gary Oak in the English version).

Tajiri drew much of his inspiration from old Japanese shows and anime, including Godzilla and Ultraman. He has stated that if he did not design video games, he would most likely be in the anime field.

=== Awards and recognition ===
&quot;IGN&quot; named Tajiri one of the top 100 game creators of all time, mainly for his ability to have built &quot;Pokémon&quot; into a &quot;worldwide phenomenon&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; credited Tajiri as one of the 10 most influential people who made the modern video game market. Video game magazine &quot;Edge&quot; placed Tajiri on their list of the &quot;Hot 100 Game Developers of 2008&quot;. Tajiri, alongside Tsunekazu Ishihara, received the Special Award from the Computer Entertainment Developers Conference in 2011. &quot;The Economist&quot; has described &quot;Pokémon&quot; as &quot;Japan&#x27;s most successful export.&quot;

<doc id="467670" wikidata="Q926441" url="?curid=467670" title="Hiram Fong">
<text>Hiram Leong Fong (born Yau Leong Fong; October 15, 1906 – August 18, 2004) was an American businessman, lawyer, and politician from Hawaii. Born to a Cantonese immigrant sugar plantation worker, Fong was one of the first two senators for Hawaii after it became the 50th US state in 1959. He was the first Chinese American and first Asian American United States Senator, serving from 1959 to 1977, and to date he remains the only Republican U.S. senator from Hawaii.

At the 1964 Republican National Convention, Fong became the first Asian American to receive delegate votes for his party&#x27;s nomination for President of the United States. In the Senate, Fong supported civil rights legislation and eliminating ethnic barriers to immigration.

== Early life and education ==
Fong was born in the Honolulu neighborhood of Kalihi on the island of Oahu as the seventh of 11 children. His father, Fong Sau Howe, was of Cantonese origin (from modern day Zhuhai) and immigrated to Hawaii in 1872, along with nearly 45,000 other immigrants who would work on sugar plantations. Fong began working at age four picking beans for cattle feed, and by the age of seven was working as a shoeshiner.

Fong attended local public schools and graduated from McKinley High School in 1924. Masaji Marumoto, who went on to become the first Japanese-American Justice on the Supreme Court of Hawaii, was a classmate. In 1930, Fong obtained a degree from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and in 1935 obtained a law degree from Harvard Law School.

== Early career ==

=== Legal and military career ===
After returning to Hawaii, Fong worked in the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney of Honolulu. In 1938, Fong went into private legal practice and founded the firm of Fong, Miho, Choy, and Robinson. In 1942, he changed his name to &quot;Hiram&quot;, reportedly in honor of Hiram Bingham I, an early Protestant missionary in Hawaii.

During World War II, he served as a Major in the United States Army Air Forces as a Judge Advocate, later retiring as a colonel from the United States Air Force Reserve.

=== Territorial politics ===
The same year he founded his law office, Fong entered elected political life as a member of the Hawaii Territorial House of Representatives where he became Speaker of the House from 1948 to 1954. During this time, he was one of the foremost leaders in the fight to make Hawaii a state. As a territorial legislator, Fong was a delegate to the 1952 Republican National Convention.

Fong was forced into retirement when the Democratic Party of Hawaii successfully ended a Hawaii Republican Party stronghold over the Hawaii Territorial Legislature by voting most Republican incumbents out of office. Fong founded several businesses after leaving the legislature.

=== Early business ventures ===
In 1952, along with five other island families, Hiram Fong started Finance Factors, one of the first industrial and consumer loan companies, to service the growing numbers of minorities who were seeking to start new businesses and buy homes.

== United States Senate ==

After Hawaii achieved statehood in 1959, Fong became one of the state&#x27;s first two U.S. Senators, serving alongside popular former Governor Oren E. Long, a Democrat.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Fong&#x27;s political success can be partially attributed to the support he received from the powerful International Longshore and Warehouse Union. In office, Fong was generally regarded as a moderate Republican, voting in favor of many of President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Great Society&quot; initiatives, such as the establishment of Medicare in 1965.

In the 1959 election, Fong won against Democrat Frank Fasi by a margin of 52.9 to 47.1%. In 1964, Fong was reelected with 53% of the vote against Democrat Thomas Gill, who received 46.4%. Fong was reelected again in 1970 by an even closer margin of 51.6 to 48.4% versus Democrat Cecil Heftel. In 1976, Fong chose to retire rather than seek reelection, and was succeeded by Democrat Spark Matsunaga.
=== Party politics ===
Fong was twice honored as Hawaii&#x27;s favorite son at the Republican National Convention in 1964 and 1968. In 1964, he became the first Asian American to receive votes for president at a major party convention, receiving the votes of the Hawaii and Alaska delegations. Fong is to date the only Republican to ever serve as a Hawaii U.S. Senator.

Fong was booed by an audience for defending George W. Romney, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in the wake of a real-estate industry scandal.

In 1960, Richard Nixon remarked that &quot;the American dream is not just a dream, it does come true – Hiram Fong&#x27;s life proves it&quot; during a visit to Hawaii.

=== Civil rights and immigration ===
Fong voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution Fong supported the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and wrote an amendment to have poll watchers safeguard the election process. Additionally, Fong voted in favor the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In 1965, during debate on Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, Fong answered questions concerning the possible change in U.S. cultural patterns by an influx of Asians: 
&quot;Asians represent six-tenths of 1 percent of the population of the United States ... concerning Japan, we estimate that there will be a total for the first 5 years of some 5,391 ... the people from that part of the world will never reach 1 percent of the population ...Our cultural pattern will never be changed as far as America is concerned.&quot; (U.S. Senate, Subcommittee on Immigration and Naturalization of the Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, D.C., February 10, 1965, pp.71, 119.)

=== Foreign policy ===
During Nixon&#x27;s presidency, Fong was a vocal supporter of the Vietnam War, which reportedly left many Asian-American constituents displeased. According to the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Fong&#x27;s support for the Vietnam War led to him losing votes in the 1970 election, his last reelection campaign.

== Personal life and legacy ==
Fong married Ellyn Lo in 1938; they had four children. After retiring from the Senate, Fong faced financial and legal difficulties, including several lawsuits with a son over the family&#x27;s businesses that forced him and his wife to declare bankruptcy in 2003. They managed a botanical garden of that was opened to the public in 1988.

On August 18, 2004, Hiram Fong died of kidney failure at his home in Honolulu; he was the last living former U.S. senator born in the 1900s decade.

Fong was a Congregationalist and was buried in Nuuanu Memorial Park and Mortuary.

=== Papers ===
Fong&#x27;s papers were donated to the University of Hawaii at Manoa Library in August 1998. Fong also provided financial support to the preservation and inventorying of over a thousand boxes, crates, and trunks of documents. Within them included papers, photos, videos, and memorabilia from Fong&#x27;s congressional tenure and pre-political life, including law-school notes. Included in the collection are series of Washington, D.C., and Hawaii office files, Post Office and Civil Service Committee (POCS) materials, and political souvenirs.

Approximately 80 boxes of books accompanied Fong&#x27;s papers, several dedicated his work on Senate committees such as the POCS. A few of the books were kept with the congressional collection, though the majority were added to the university library. A gift book plate was designed for these incorporating the senator&#x27;s noted signature. The papers were processed in 2003 by archivist Dee Hazelrigg, and are available to researchers by appointment.

<doc id="467678" wikidata="Q1053176" url="?curid=467678" title="Naas Botha">
<text>Hendrik Egnatius &#x27;Naas&#x27; Botha (born 27 February 1958) is a South African former rugby union player who played as a Fly-half for Northern Transvaal, Rugby Rovigo and South Africa (the Springboks).

He was voted SA Rugby Player of the Year in 1979, 1981, 1985 and 1987. Botha mostly played in the fly-half position and is now a rugby commentator for the South African M-Net and Supersport TV channels. He is also the Director of Rugby at Hoërskool Eldoraigne.

== Family and early career ==

Botha was born in the town of Breyten in the Eastern Transvaal (now Mpumalanga), South Africa and went to school at the Hoërskool Hendrik Verwoerd in Pretoria. As a child, Botha aspired to playing professional baseball and applied for a sport scholarship in the United States. Botha was also an excellent schools cricket and tennis player and also a hurdles athlete.

However, Botha was selected to play for the South African under-20 rugby team, where he caught the eye of the selectors while still a student at the University of Pretoria.

As a result, Botha played his first Test for the Springboks on 26 April 1980 at the age of 22 in the flyhalf position against South America at Wanderers, Johannesburg.

== Rugby union ==

Botha was best known for extremely accurate (both left- and right-footed) kicking, which earned him the nickname &quot;Nasty Booter&quot; from the British press when the British Lions toured South Africa in 1980. He is best remembered for his abilities as a very successful drop-kicker in high pressure situations and is also considered to have had an outstanding tactical understanding of rugby.

While Botha was sometimes criticised for avoiding physical contact and not running with the ball, his handling of the ball was very deft and he could get his backline moving very quickly with accurate short- and long-range passing. As a result, he scored many tries and contributed to many more. However, some consider that he was somewhat weak in defence. Nevertheless, Danie Craven once said, &quot;Give me Naas, and I&#x27;ll conquer the world!&quot;

Botha remained the highest points scorer in Springbok rugby history for a number of years, with a points total of 312. His tally was passed by Percy Montgomery on 17 July 2004. However, Montgomery passed him in his 50th match, while Botha had only played in 28.

In addition to his Springbok rugby-playing duties, Botha also played for the Northern Transvaal province (nicknamed the &quot;Blou Bulle&quot;, which means &quot;Blue Bulls&quot;, now their official name) from 1977 to 1995. During this period they won the Currie Cup nine times (sharing it twice with Western Province in 1979 and 1989). He was also captain of the province a record 128 times and scored a record 2,511 points (including 1,699 points in the Currie Cup).

== The 1981 tour and sporting bans ==

In 1980, Botha traveled with the Springboks to South America.

The &#x27;boks beat France at Loftus Versveld in Pretoria; in 1981 they subsequently beat Ireland in their warm-up to their tour of New Zealand. Public opinion was deeply divided over the New Zealand tour. Botha and his fellow Springboks&#x27; focus on playing rugby was made difficult by actions such as pitch invasions and aircraft fly-bys from protesters opposed to South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policies. South Africa lost the series 2-1, although the implications of the tour went far beyond rugby.

As an indirect result of this tour, South Africa was banned by the International Rugby Board from international competition until 1992. This meant that, apart from hosting the rebel New Zealand Cavaliers tour in 1986, Botha played few international games, including two tests in 1989 against a World 15 made up by players from England, Wales and France. Domestically he continued to excel: in 15 seasons playing for Northern Transvaal he played in 11 Currie Cup finals, winning nine (two shared) and scoring a record 2,511 points.

== International career ==

In the pre-professional era that Botha played in, being paid to play rugby was always a controversial subject. Despite being handsomely paid &quot;under the table&quot;, Botha was of the opinion that he could earn more in professional sport, and was invited by the American football team the Dallas Cowboys in 1983 to travel to the United States to try out as a placekicker. While in the United States, Naas also played rugby with the Dallas Harlequins, where he helped them to the 1984 USA National Club Championships. The Dallas try-out was ultimately not successful, and he returned to South Africa to continue his rugby career.

In 1987, once again primarily for monetary considerations, Botha moved to the Italian club Rugby Rovigo, where he was coached by the former Springboks coach Nelie Smith and played alongside fellow South Africans Tito Lupini and Gert Smal. During the course of 6 seasons, Botha played 119 games for Rovigo and helped the team winning two National Championships (in 1988 and 1990), ending a 9 years drought, also reaching the final twice (1989 and 1992), in addition to a semifinal (1991) and a quarter final (1993). The Botha-era is still vividly remembered in Rovigo, the most rugby-addicted city in Italy, where the former player enjoys a sort of Maradona/Napoli aura.

== Return to the Springboks ==

Botha&#x27;s career lasted long enough for him to see South Africa let back into the international rugby fold and to play in one-off Tests against World Cup holders Australia and New Zealand. Both games ended in defeat. Botha then toured France with the Springboks, before bowing out, age 34, as flyhalf against England at Twickenham, London, in a 33–16 defeat on 14 November 1992.

Botha had set countless Springbok records during his rugby career and is still considered to be one of the Springbok &quot;greats&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Botha is now married to Karen, a former Springbok athlete and long jump record-holder; the couple have three daughters, Kyla (1991) Gaeby (1998) and Lee-gre (2003).

== Career stats ==

<text>Montana Management is a trust fund once owned by Saddam Hussein. It has a 2% holding in the Lagardère Group; however all its holdings are frozen.

The name was lifted from the money-laundering front company controlled by fictional drug lord Tony Montana (Al Pacino) in the 1983 film &quot;Scarface&quot;. Saddam and his sons Uday Hussein and Qusay Hussein were allegedly big fans of the film.

<doc id="467682" wikidata="Q3372915" url="?curid=467682" title="Idol (Norwegian TV series)">
<text>Idol - Jakten på en superstjerne is a television show on the Norwegian television channel TV 2, based on the popular British show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. The show describes itself as a &quot;Search For A SuperStar&quot;. The contestants are first narrowed down to 100 contestants, and then down to 24-50 through several auditions and tests by a panel of judges. From this point on, the viewers decide who are in and who are out, and the judges limit themselves to commenting. TV viewers being what they are, the votes are based not solely on the singers vocal performance, but also on his or her looks, clothes, entertainment value, and other factors. In the first four seasons the agelimit for participation was 16–28 years old. In season five it was changed to 16–35.

Idol in Norway is unique in that contestants have been allowed to perform self composed songs since the first season in 2003.

==Season synopsis==

===Season 1===

In the first season (2003), 50 people were narrowed down to 10, with each contestant performing live. However, the official number of legal contestants was narrowed down to nine when Idol-finalist Jeanette Vik was disqualified for being underage. Tone Anette Eidsheim Elde who had been eliminated in the very first finalshow got a second chance. Four judges provided critiques of each competitor&#x27;s performance. Viewers had several hours following the broadcast of the show to phone in their votes for their favorite contestant. Later the same night, the contestant with the fewest votes was sent home.

Kurt Nilsen won season one, with Gaute Ormåsen coming in second. Kurt got 53% of the votes. Nilsen went on to win World Idol in the beginning of 2004.

===Season 2===

In the second season (2004) they changed the procedures a bit. First the contestants were narrowed down to 40 instead of 50. Then, after four shows where 2 of 10 were voted forward in each show, a fifth show was aired, where eight &quot;wildcards&quot; selected by the judges from all of the earlier contestants competed for the two last places. In addition to these 10 finalists, the judges picked a final 11th contestant, Håkon Njøten.

Kjartan Salvesen won season two, with Margaret Berger coming in second. Kjartan got 59% of the votes.

===Season 3===
The third season (2005) was a bit different as well. First the contestants were narrowed down to 50. Then, after five shows where 2 of 10 were voted forward in each show. But the judges were not pleased and got to take two more straight to final, Erik Flaa and David Bakke, making the total of finalists to 12.

Jorun Stiansen won season three, with Tone Damli Aaberge coming in second. Jorun got 55% of the votes.

===Season 4===

The fourth season (2006) was, yet again, a bit different. First the contestants were narrowed down to 40. Then after five shows where 2 of 8 were voted forward in each show, a sixth show was aired, where eight &quot;wildcards&quot; selected by the judges from all the earlier contestants competed for the two last places, making the total of finalists to 12. Before the third finalshow Iselin Andresen withdrew from the competition, and the last person to be eliminated, Audun Rensel, was given a second chance. But as he declined and Siri Helene Erland, who was originally eliminated in the very first finalshow returned instead.

Aleksander Denstad With won season four, with Jonas Thomassen coming in second. Aleksander got 55% of the votes.

===Season 5===

The fifth season finished airing in December 2007 on TV2. This season the age limit was changed from 16–28 to 16–35.

The fifth season of Idol in Norway saw contestants able to perform with an instrument at any stage of the competition whereas other adaptations of Idol that have introduced live instrumentation only allow the concept at certain times during the show.

Glenn Lyse won season five, with Bjørn Johan Muri coming in second. Glenn got 57% of the votes.

===Season 6===

In 2011 a sixth season was announced making the show return after being off-air for nearly four years. The age limit is again 16-35 and auditions are currently held in Oslo (18 April), Trondheim (9 May), Stavanger (16 May) and Bergen.

Jenny Langlo won season six, with Vegard Leite coming in second. Jenny got 52% of the votes.

===Season 7===

In 2013, a seventh season was commissioned after a two-year break. The age limit was set to 16–35, and the show was hosted by Stian Blipp.

Siri Vølstad Jensen won season seven, with Eirik Søfteland coming in second. Astrid S placed fifth. Siri won with 55% of the received votes and became the youngest winner of Idol in Norway ever, beating previous winner Jenny Langlo by a year.

===Season 8===

===Season 9===

=== Season 10 ===
The tenth season of Idol took place in the fall of 2018. The show was hosted by Katarina Flatland, who is also known as a TV-show hostess from shows like &quot;Jakten på kjærligheten&quot; and &quot;Sommeråpent&quot;.

The judges were Gunnar Greve (founder of MER Music), Tshawe Baqwa (from the urban pop-duo Madcon) and Silje Larsen Borgan (co-founder of Little Big Sister and Nora Collective).

The winner of the tenth season of Norwegian Idol 2018 was Øystein Hegvik, who performed the original song &quot;Before I Go&quot; in the final episode. The song was written by Kristin Marie Skolem, Thomas Alexander Strandskogen and Victor Karlsen Klæbo - all students at Lillehammer Institute of Music Production and Industries, also known as LIMPI. After being released, the song made it directly into Spotify&#x27;s Norway Top 50 list, were it peaked at 23rd place.

<doc id="467685" wikidata="Q986786" url="?curid=467685" title="Transactional interpretation">
<text>The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics (TIQM) takes the wave function of the standard quantum formalism, and its complex conjugate, to be retarded (forward in time) and advanced (backward in time) waves that form a quantum interaction as a Wheeler–Feynman handshake or transaction. It was first proposed in 1986 by John G. Cramer, who argues that it helps in developing intuition for quantum processes. He also suggests that it avoids the philosophical problems with the Copenhagen interpretation and the role of the observer, and also resolves various quantum paradoxes. TIQM formed a minor plot point in his science fiction novel &quot;Einstein&#x27;s Bridge&quot;.

More recently, he has also argued TIQM to be consistent with the Afshar experiment, while claiming that the Copenhagen interpretation and the many-worlds interpretation are not.

The existence of both advanced and retarded waves as admissible solutions to Maxwell&#x27;s equations was explored in the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory. Cramer revived their idea of two waves for his transactional interpretation of quantum theory. While the ordinary Schrödinger equation does not admit advanced solutions, its relativistic version does, and these advanced solutions are the ones used by TIQM.

In TIQM, the source emits a usual (retarded) wave forward in time, but it also emits an advanced wave backward in time; furthermore, the receiver, who is later in time, also emits an advanced wave backward in time and a retarded wave forward in time. A quantum event occurs when a &quot;handshake&quot; exchange of advanced and retarded waves triggers the formation of a transaction in which energy, momentum, angular momentum, etc. are transferred. The quantum mechanism behind transaction formation has been demonstrated explicitly for the case of a photon transfer between atoms in Sect. 5.4 of Carver Mead&#x27;s book &quot;Collective Electrodynamics&quot;. In this interpretation, the collapse of the wavefunction does not happen at any specific point in time, but is &quot;atemporal&quot; and occurs along the whole transaction, and the emission/absorption process is time-symmetric. The waves are seen as physically real, rather than a mere mathematical device to record the observer&#x27;s knowledge as in some other interpretations of quantum mechanics. Philosopher and writer Ruth Kastner argues that the waves exist as possibilities outside of physical spacetime and that therefore it is necessary to accept such possibilities as part of reality.

Cramer has used TIQM in teaching quantum mechanics at the University of Washington in Seattle.

==Advances over previous interpretations==
TIQM is explicitly non-local and, as a consequence, logically consistent with counterfactual definiteness (CFD), the minimum realist assumption. As such it incorporates the non-locality demonstrated by the Bell test experiments and eliminates the observer-dependent reality that has been criticized as part of the Copenhagen interpretation. Cramer states that the key advances over Everett&#x27;s Relative State Interpretation are that the transactional interpretation has a physical collapse and is time-symmetric. Cramer also states that the TI is consistent with but not dependent upon the notion of an Einsteinian block universe. Kastner claims that by considering the product of the advanced and retarded wavefunctions, the Born rule can be explained ontologically.

The transactional interpretation is superficially similar to the two-state vector formalism (TSVF) which has its origin in work by Yakir Aharonov, Peter Bergmann and Joel Lebowitz of 1964. However, it has important differences—the TSVF is lacking the confirmation and therefore cannot provide a physical referent for the Born Rule (as TI does). Kastner has criticized some other time-symmetric interpretations, including TSVF, as making ontologically inconsistent claims.

Kastner has developed a new &quot;Relativistic Transactional Interpretation&quot; (RTI) also called &quot;Possibilist Transactional Interpretation&quot; (PTI) in which space-time itself emerges by a way of transactions. It has been argued that this relativistic transactional interpretation can provide the quantum dynamics for the causal sets program.

==Debate==
In 1996, Tim Maudlin proposed a thought experiment involving Wheeler&#x27;s delayed choice experiment that is generally taken as a refutation of TIQM. However Kastner showed Maudlin&#x27;s argument is not fatal for TIQM.

In his book, &quot;The Quantum Handshake&quot;, Cramer has added a hierarchy to the description of pseudo-time to deal with Maudlin&#x27;s objection and has pointed out that some of Maudlin&#x27;s arguments are based on the inappropriate application of Heisenberg&#x27;s knowledge interpretation to the transactional description.

<doc id="467690" wikidata="Q6815291" url="?curid=467690" title="Memoirs v. Massachusetts">
<text>Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413 (1966), was the United States Supreme Court decision that attempted to clarify a holding regarding obscenity made a decade earlier in &quot;Roth v. United States&quot; (1957).

The &quot;Roth&quot; ruling established that for a work of literature to be considered obscene, it had to be proven by censors to: 1) appeal to interest, 2) be patently offensive, and 3) have no redeeming social value. The literature in &quot;Roth v. United States&quot; was &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; (or &quot;Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure&quot;, 1749) by John Cleland and the Court held in &quot;Memoirs v. Massachusetts&quot; that, while it might fit the first two criteria (it appealed to prurient interest and was patently offensive), it could not be proven that &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; had no redeeming social value. The judgment favoring the plaintiff continued that it could still be held obscene under certain circumstances for instance, if it were marketed solely for its prurient appeal.

&quot;Memoirs v. Massachusetts&quot; led to more years of debate about what is and is not obscene, eventually conferring more power in these matters to proposers of local community standards.

<doc id="467693" wikidata="Q2915459" url="?curid=467693" title="Lords Spiritual">
<text>The Lords Spiritual are the bishops of the Church of England who sit in the House of Lords of the United Kingdom. Up to 26 of the 42 diocesan bishops and archbishops of the Church of England serve as Lords Spiritual (not including retired bishops who sit by right of a peerage). The Church of Scotland, which is Presbyterian, and the Anglican churches in Wales and in Northern Ireland, which are no longer established churches, are not represented. The Lords Spiritual are distinct from the Lords Temporal, their secular counterparts who also sit in the House of Lords.

==Ranks and titles==
There are 42 dioceses in the Church of England, each led by a diocesan bishop. The archbishop of Canterbury and the archbishop of York, as Primate of All England and Primate of England, respectively, have oversight over their corresponding ecclesiastical provinces. The occupants of the five &quot;great sees&quot; – Canterbury, York, London, Durham and Winchester – are always Lords Spiritual.

Of the remaining 37 bishops, the 21 most senior usually sit in the House of Lords. Following the first ordinations of female bishops in the Church of England, the normal operation of this rule was suspended by the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015, which provides that until 2025 every woman appointed as a diocesan bishop will automatically become a Lord Spiritual when a vacancy next arises, regardless of seniority, so as to increase the representation of female bishops in the House. Otherwise, seniority is determined by total length of service as an English diocesan bishop (that is to say, it is not lost by translation to another see). The Bishop of Sodor and Man and the Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe do not sit in the House of Lords regardless of seniority, as their dioceses lie outside both England and the United Kingdom.

Theoretically, the power to elect archbishops and bishops is vested in the diocesan cathedral&#x27;s college of canons. Practically, however, the choice of the archbishop or bishop is made prior to the election. The prime minister chooses from among a set of nominees proposed by the Crown Nominations Commission, and the sovereign then instructs the college of canons to elect the nominated individual as a bishop or archbishop.

One of the Lords Spiritual is appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury to be the &quot;convenor&quot; of the bench; he or she coordinates the work of the bishops in the House. Alan Smith, Bishop of St Albans, was appointed the current convenor on 23 September 2022.

==Status as peers==
Even during the early years of the Peerage, the position of bishops was unclear. During the reign of King Richard II, the Archbishop of Canterbury declared, &quot;of right and by the custom of the realm of England it belongeth to the Archbishop of Canterbury for the time being as well as others his suffragans, brethren and fellow Bishops, Abbots and Priors and other prelates whatsoever,—to be present in person in all the King&#x27;s Parliaments whatsoever as Peers of the Realm&quot;. The claim was neither agreed nor disagreed to, however, by Parliament.

The Lords Spiritual at first declared themselves entirely outside the jurisdiction of secular authorities; the question of trial in the House of Lords did not arise. When papal authority was great, the King could do little but admit a lack of jurisdiction over the prelates. Later, however, when the power of the Pope in England was reduced, the Lords Spiritual came under the authority of the secular courts. The jurisdiction of the common courts was clearly established by the time of Henry VIII, who declared himself head of the Church of England in place of the Pope, ending the constitutional power of the Roman Catholic Church in England.

Despite their failure to be tried as temporal peers in the House of Lords, it remained unclear whether the Lords Spiritual were indeed peers. In 1688, the issue arose during the trial of the Seven Bishops—William Sancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury; Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet, Bishop of Winchester; Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells; John Lake, Bishop of Chester; William Lloyd, Bishop of Worcester; Francis Turner, Bishop of Ely; and Thomas White, Bishop of Peterborough—by a common jury. The charge was that a petition sent by the Bishops constituted seditious libel; the Bishops argued that they had the right to petition the Sovereign at any time, while the prosecution charged that such a right was only permissible when Parliament was in session (which, at the time of the delivery of the petition, it was not). If the bishops were only Lords of Parliament, and not peers, their right to petition would be vitiated while Parliament was dissolved. Peers, however, were and still are counsellors of the Sovereign whether Parliament is in session or not; therefore, if the bishops were indeed peers, they would be free to send petitions. Since there was no doubt that the petition was actually sent, while the Court still ruled the bishops not guilty, it appears that it was taken for granted that the bishops were counsellors of the Crown.

Nevertheless, the &quot;Standing Orders of the House of Lords&quot; provide, &quot;Bishops to whom a writ of summons has been issued are not Peers but are Lords of Parliament.&quot;

==Number==
In the early history of the Parliament of England, the Lords Spiritual—including the abbots—outnumbered the Lords Temporal. Between 1536 and 1540, however, King Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries, thereby removing the seats of the abbots. For the first time, and from then on, the Lords Spiritual formed a minority in the House of Lords.

In addition to the 21 older dioceses (including four in Wales), Henry VIII created six new ones, of which five survived (see Historical development of Church of England dioceses); the Bishops of the Church of England were excluded in 1642 but regained their seats following the Stuart Restoration; from then until the early 19th century no new sees were created, and the number of Lords Spiritual remained at 26.

Bishops, abbots, and priors of the Church of Scotland historically sat in the Parliament of Scotland. Laymen acquired the monasteries in 1560, following the Scottish Reformation, and therefore those sitting as &quot;abbots&quot; and &quot;priors&quot; were all laymen after that time. Bishops of the Church of Scotland continued to sit, regardless of their religious conformity. Roman Catholic clergy were excluded in 1567, but Episcopal bishops continued to sit until they too were excluded in 1638. The bishops regained their seats following the Restoration, but were again excluded in 1689, following the final abolition of diocesan bishops and the permanent establishment of the Church of Scotland as Presbyterian. There are no longer bishops in the Church of Scotland, and that church has never sent any clergy to sit in the House of Lords at Westminster.

Bishops and archbishops of the Church of Ireland were entitled to sit in the Irish House of Lords as Lords Spiritual. They obtained representation in the Westminster House of Lords after the union of Ireland and Great Britain in 1801. Of the Church of Ireland&#x27;s ecclesiastics, four (one archbishop and three bishops) were to sit at any one time, with the members rotating at the end of every parliamentary session (which normally lasted about one year). The Church of Ireland, however, was disestablished in 1871, and thereafter ceased to be represented by Lords Spiritual.

The Bishop of Sodor and Man, although a Bishop of the Church of England, has never been included among the English Lords Spiritual, as the Isle of Man has never been part of the Kingdom of England or of the United Kingdom. The Lord Bishop is the holder of the oldest office in Tynwald (the oldest continuous parliament in the world) and remains an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of Tynwald Court and of the island&#x27;s Legislative Council, although this has recently (2020s) been the subject of some controversy.

In the early 19th century, as the population of industrial cities grew, the Church of England proposed two new bishoprics for Leeds and Manchester, but the government refused to increase the number of Lords Spiritual. The Church was reluctant to have two classes of diocesan bishops, and decided to combine other dioceses to allow for the new dioceses. In 1836, the first new bishopric was founded, that of Ripon; but it was balanced out by the merger of the Bishoprics of Bristol and Gloucester. (They were later separated again.) The creation of the Bishopric of Manchester was also planned but delayed until the dioceses of St Asaph and Bangor could be merged. They never were, but the Bishopric of Manchester Act 1847 went ahead anyway with an alternative way to maintain the 26-bishop limit in the House of Lords: the seniority-based proviso which has been maintained to this day. However, the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015 gives any woman appointed a diocesan bishop in England during the next decade priority in succeeding those among the current 21 who retire during that period. Rachel Treweek became Bishop of Gloucester and the first woman Lord Spiritual under the Act in 2015; Christine Hardman became the second later that year.

In 1920, with the independence of the Church in Wales from the Church of England and its disestablishment, the Welsh bishops stopped being eligible for inclusion.

The 26 seats for the Lords Spiritual make up per cent of the total membership of the House of Lords ( seats, ).

==Politics==
Although the Lords Spiritual have no party affiliation, they do not sit on the crossbenches; their seats are on the Government side of the Lords chamber, also known as the &quot;spiritual side&quot;, on the right-hand side of and nearest to the throne. Though in a full sitting the Bishops occupy almost three rows, their front bench is subtly distinguished by being the only one in the House with a single armrest at either end; it is on the front row, close to the throne end of the chamber, indicating their unique status.

By custom, at least one of the Bishops reads prayers in each legislative day (a role taken by the Chaplain to the Speaker in the Commons). They often speak in debates; in 2004 Rowan Williams, then Archbishop of Canterbury, opened a debate into sentencing legislation. Measures (proposed laws of the Church of England) must be put before the Lords, and the Lords Spiritual have a role in ensuring that this takes place.

==Retired bishops as Lords Temporal==
Since 1928, retiring Archbishops of Canterbury have been created peers, enabling them to continue to sit in the House as Lords Temporal after their term as Lords Spiritual ended. Archbishops Davidson (1928) and Lang (1942) were created hereditary peers (though both were without male heirs and their titles became extinct on their deaths). Archbishops Fisher (1961), Ramsey (1974), Coggan (1980), Runcie (1991), Carey (2002) and Williams (2013) were created life peers. 

Archbishops Lang, Ramsey and Coggan each served as Archbishop of York before translation to Canterbury. Successive retiring Archbishops of York after them have been created life peers:- Archbishops Blanch (1983), Habgood (1995) Hope (2005) and Sentamu (2021). 

Robin Eames, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh, was created a life peer in 1995 in recognition of his work for reconciliation and in the Northern Ireland peace process. 

Less commonly, other retired diocesans have been created life peers:- Bishops David Sheppard of Liverpool (1997), Richard Harries of Oxford (2006) and Richard Chartres of London (2017).

==Other religious figures as Lords Temporal== 

Other Christian clergy have been appointed to the House of Lords:

* Anglican priests Lord Beaumont of Whitley (1967), Lord Pilkington of Oxenford (1995), Lord Rook (2025), and Lord Biggar (2025).
* Church of Scotland minister and Moderator of the General Assembly Lord MacLeod of Fuinary (1967)
* Methodist ministers Lord Soper (1965), Baroness Richardson of Calow (1998), and Lord Griffiths of Burry Port (2004), each of whom served as  President of the Methodist Conference. 
* Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster ministers Lord Bannside (2010) and Lord McCrea of Magherafelt and Cookstown (2018). 

There have been no Roman Catholic clergy appointed since the Reformation. However, it was rumoured that Basil Cardinal Hume, the Archbishop of Westminster, and his successor, Cardinal Cormac Murphy O&#x27;Connor, were offered peerages by James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair respectively, but declined. Cardinal Hume later accepted the Order of Merit, a personal appointment of the Queen, shortly before his death. Cardinal Murphy O&#x27;Connor said he had his maiden speech ready, but under Canon 285 of the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;, ordained Catholic clergy of the Latin Church (by far the largest Catholic denomination in Britain) are discouraged from holding public office of any state other than the Holy See, and secular priests and bishops are completely prohibited from &quot;public offices which entail a participation in the exercise of civil power&quot;.

Jewish rabbis have also been appointed to the House of Lords:

*Chief Rabbis of the United Hebrew Congregations Lord Jakobovits (1988) and Lord Sacks (2009) 
*Reform rabbi Baroness Neuberger (2004)

==Reforms==

===2011 proposed House of Lords reform===
Under the House of Lords Reform Bill 2012, proposed by the Coalition Government, the Lords would be either 80% elected and 20% appointed, or 100% elected. In the former case, there would be 12 Church of England bishops in the reformed upper house. The total of 12 bishops would include the five &quot;named Lords Spiritual&quot; (the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and the Bishops of Durham, London and Winchester, entitled as they are to sit &quot;ex officio&quot;) plus seven other &quot;ordinary Lords Spiritual&quot; (diocesan bishops chosen by the church itself through whatever device it deems appropriate). The reduction from 26 to 12 bishops would be achieved in a stepped fashion: up to 21 bishops would remain for the 2015–2020 period and up to 16 for the 2020–2025 period. The ordinary Lords Spirituals&#x27; terms would coincide with each &quot;electoral period&quot; (i.e., the period from one election to the next), with the church able to name up to seven to serve during each electoral period. These reforms were later dropped.

=== 2015 change temporarily giving preference to women===
Under the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015 whenever a vacancy arises among the Lords Spiritual during the ten years following the Act coming into force (18 May 2015 – 18 May 2025), the vacancy has to be filled by a woman, if one is eligible. The Act does not apply to the sees of Canterbury, York, London, Durham and Winchester, the holders of which automatically have a seat in the House of Lords. Six women have subsequently become Lords Spiritual as a result (one of whom has since retired), as of September 2023. (Additionally, Sarah Mullally entered the Lords &quot;ex officio&quot; when appointed Bishop of London in 2018.) Further legislation was announced in July 2024 which is intended to extend this provision until May 2030.

==Criticism==
The presence of the Lords Spiritual in the House of Lords has been criticised, with some media commentators and organisations arguing that the system is outdated and undemocratic. Humanists UK has described it as &quot;unacceptable&quot; that &quot;the UK is the only Western democracy to give religious representatives the automatic right to sit in the legislature&quot;. There has also been criticism of the &quot;anomaly of having religious representation from one of the four nations of the United Kingdom but not from the other three&quot;; while the appointment procedures have been described as &quot;secretive and flawed&quot;.

Richard Chartres, then Bishop of London, defended the bishops in 2007, saying they are &quot;in touch with a great range of opinions and institutions&quot;, and suggesting the inclusion of &quot;leading members in Britain&#x27;s [other] faith communities&quot;.

== Experience ==
From 1971 to 1973 Budarin was serving the Soviet Army in Czechoslovakia. Budarin occupied various engineering positions at NPO Energia where he was involved in experimental investigations and testing of space technology. From 1976 he was employed as an electrician, from 1978 as an electrical foreman, from 1982 as a test engineer, from 1986 as the head of a group, from 1988 until joining the cosmonauts corps as the lead specialist, head of a group at the NPO Energia check-out and testing facility.

== Cosmonaut career ==

In February 1989 he was enrolled in the Energia cosmonaut detachment as a candidate test cosmonaut. From September 1989 to January 1991, he underwent a complete basic space training course at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center and passed a State examination and was qualified as a Test Cosmonaut. From February 1991 to December 1993, he took an advanced training course for the Soyuz-TM transport vehicle and the Mir Station flight. From May 1994 till February 1995 he completed training as the flight engineer of the backup crew of Soyuz TM-21 under Expedition-18/NASA-1 program, and, simultaneously, as the flight engineer of the main crew of Mir under Expedition-19 (Mir EO-19) program. From 27 March till May 1995, Budarin was trained for a mission under Mir EO-19 program as the flight engineer of the first crew, and from 15 May to 26 June, he trained for the STS-71 mission in the United States.

=== Mir EO-19 ===
From 27 June to 11 September 1995, Budarin participated in a space mission as a board engineer of the 19th long-term Mir expedition. He was launched into space by on the STS-71 mission. &quot;Atlantis&quot; lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center at 19:32:19 UTC on 27 June 1995. After 2 days of solo flight the space shuttle docked with the Mir station on 29 June 1995, at 13:00:16 UTC. Budarin spent 75 days, 11 hours and 20minutes in space and landed on the Soyuz TM-21 spacecraft. The Soyuz capsule carrying Budarin and cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev landed on 11 September 1995 at 06:52:40 UTC, 108 km north east of Arkalyk.

=== Mir EO-25 ===
From 28 January to 25 August 1998, he participated in a space mission as a board engineer of the 25th long-term expedition aboard the Mir orbital station. The Soyuz TM-27 spacecraft with Budarin, cosmonaut Talgat Musabayev and ESA astronaut Léopold Eyharts lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on 29 January 1998, at 16:33:42 UTC. Following a two-day autonomous flight the Soyuz spacecraft docked with the Mir station on 31 January 1998. Musabayev and Budarin together with NASA astronaut Andy Thomas became the 25th resident crew of Mir. First in the focus of the crew was the French mission PEGASE which was mainly dedicated to the life sciences, physical sciences physiques and space technology. They also worked on common scientific experiments. Soyuz TM-27 carrying Budarin, Musabayev and Yuri Baturin landed near Dzhezkazgan on 25 August 1998 at 05:24:44 UTC. During the Soyuz and Mir missions Budarin spent 207 days, 12 hours and 51 minutes in space.

=== Expedition 6 ===
From 23 November 2002 to 3 May 2003, Budarin logged 161 days, 1 hour and 14 minutes in space as an Expedition 6 flight engineer aboard the International Space Station. The Expedition 6 crew was launched by Space Shuttle on the STS-113 mission. &quot;Endeavour&quot; launched into space from the KSC LC-39A on 24 November 2002, at 00:49:47 UTC and docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on 25 November 2002 at 21:59 UTC. During the stay aboard the ISS, Budrain spent time between several Russian science and medical experiments. One experiment called Diatomeya involved observation of ocean surface in order to determine regions best suited for fishing. Another was to monitor glacier dynamics from space to better understand the effects of global warming. The medical research he conducted studied the effects of microgravity on the human body. Budarin returned to Earth onboard the Soyuz TMA-1 spacecraft with NASA astronauts Kenneth Bowersox and Donald Pettit. The capsule landed on 4 May 2003 at 02:04:25 UTC and following a ballistic trajectory. A technical commission was established to find the cause of the problem. It revealed that the cause of switching to the ballistic descent mode was an inadequate reaction of the descent control unit within the descent control system to the signals from gyroscope and the angular rate meter.

=== Spacewalks ===
During his two visits to the Mir orbital station, Budarin performed eight spacewalks totaling 44 hours.

On 14 July 1995, Budarin conducted his first career spacewalk joined by fellow cosmonaut, Anatoly Solovyev. The two spacewalkers deployed the &quot;Spektr&quot; solar array and inspected the docking port. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 34 minutes.

On 19 July 1995, Budarin conducted his second career spacewalk along with Anatoly Solovyev. The two prepared for MIRAS spectrometer deployment and retrieved the TREK experiment and changed exposure materials. The spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 8 minutes.

Two days later on 21 July, Budarin conducted his third career spacewalk, again with Solovyev. During the 5 hour 35 minute EVA, the two installed the MIRAS spectrometer.

On 1 April 1998, Budarin conducted his fourth career spacewalk. He and fellow cosmonaut Talgat Musabayev started repairing a solar panel damaged in the collision between Mir and the Progress M-34 supply ship. The spacewalk started at 13:35 UTC and ended at 20:15 UTC, lasting 6 hours and 40 minutes.

On 6 April 1998, Budarin conducted his fifth career spacewalk, with Talgat Musabayev. The two completed the repair work on the broken &quot;Spektr&quot; solar panel. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 15 minutes. While the two spacewalkers were struggling with installing a brace on the solar panel, Mir suddenly went to free drift and began turning away from the sun. The two were ordered to rush through the final bracing procedure and then perform an expedited entry. The spacewalk was originally planned for 3 March, but the crew was unable to open the EVA hatch leading to space, which necessitated the rescheduling of the spacewalk. Budarin failed to open the last of the 10 locks that was closed so tightly and in the process he broke three wrenches.

On 11 April 1998, Budarin conducted his sixth career spacewalk. Along with Talgat Musabayev, the two removed Mir&#x27;s VDU. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 25 minutes.

On 17 April 1998, Budarin conducted his seventh career spacewalk. During a 6-hour 33 minute spacewalk, Budarin and Talgat Musabayev installed a new VDU which was delivered by Progress M-38. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 33 minutes.

Five days later on 22 April, Budarin completed his eighth career spacewalk. He and Musabayev completed the new VDU installation. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 21 minutes.

During Expedition 6, on 15 January 2003, Budarin was supposed to join NASA astronaut Kenneth Bowersox in a six-hour spacewalk outside the ISS. However, after failing to meet U.S standards in tests on a stationary bicycle in December 2002, NASA barred him from making a spacewalk citing medical reasons. The claim was rejected by the Russian authorities, which pronounced Budarin was healthy despite NASA concerns about cardiovascular &quot;peculiarities&quot;. They said that the peculiarities of Budarin&#x27;s cardiovascular system were known to the authorities and that Budarin had them on previous flights as well. The spacewalk was eventually carried out by NASA astronauts Bowersox and Donald Pettit.

<text>Kenneth Dwane &quot;Sox&quot; Bowersox (born November 14, 1956) is a United States Navy officer and former NASA astronaut. He is a veteran of five Space Shuttle launches and an extended stay aboard the International Space Station. When he launched on STS-73 at the age of 38 years and 11 months, he became the youngest person to command a Space Shuttle.

== Early life and education ==
Bowersox was born November 14, 1956, in Portsmouth, Virginia, but considers Bedford, Indiana his home town. As a young boy, his family lived in Oxnard, California for seven years and he attended Rio Real Elementary School. Bowersox was active in the Boy Scouts of America, and is an Eagle Scout. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, before receiving his commission in 1978. A year later, in 1979, he received a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Columbia University in New York City, New York. Bowersox attended the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School and graduated with Class 85A. He served as a test pilot on A-7E and F/A-18 aircraft, and was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1987. Bowersox holds the rank of Captain in the United States Navy.

== NASA career ==
He was selected as an Astronaut Pilot by NASA in 1987.

=== STS-50 ===
Bowersox&#x27;s first mission was STS-50 aboard the &quot;Columbia&quot;, where he served as the pilot. The mission launched on June 25, 1992, from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida at 16:12:23 UTC. Its primary objective was to conduct experiments in the U.S. Microgravity Laboratory 1 (USML-1), a Spacelab module dedicated to the study of microgravity. This module housed experiments related to fluid dynamics, crystal growth, combustion, and biological processes.

The mission concluded with a landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility, Florida on July 9, 1992, at 11:42:27 UTC.

=== STS-61 ===
Bowersox&#x27;s second mission was STS-61 aboard the &quot;Endeavour&quot;, in which he served as the pilot. The mission was launched on December 2, 1993, from Launch Complex 39B at 09:27:00 UTC. The mission&#x27;s primary objective was the first servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope, during which astronauts performed a series of spacewalks to repair and upgrade the telescope&#x27;s systems, thereby restoring its optical performance and extending its operational lifespan. STS-61 concluded with the &quot;Endeavour&quot; landing successfully at the Shuttle Landing Facility on December 13, 1993, at 05:25:37 UTC.

=== STS-73 ===
Bowersox&#x27;s third mission was STS-73 aboard the &quot;Columbia&quot;, where he served for the first time as the mission commander. The mission was launched on October 20, 1995, from Launch Complex 39B at 13:53:00 UTC. STS-73&#x27;s primary objective was to conduct a series of experiments in the U.S. Microgravity Laboratory-2 (USML-2), focusing on materials science, biotechnology, combustion science, and fluid mechanics in the unique microgravity environment of space. The mission concluded with &quot;Columbia&quot; landing successfully at the Shuttle Landing Facility on November 5, 1995, at 11:45:21 UTC.

=== STS-82 ===

Bowersox&#x27;s fourth mission in space was STS-82 aboard the &quot;Discovery&quot;, where he served as the mission commander. The mission launched on February 11, 1997, from Launch Complex 39A at 08:55:17 UTC. STS-82 was the second servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. During the mission, astronauts performed a series of spacewalks to install new instruments and conduct repairs on the telescope.

The tasks undertaken aimed to enhance the telescope&#x27;s operational capabilities. Following the completion of its objectives, STS-82 concluded with &quot;Discovery&quot; landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility on February 21, 1997, at 08:32:00 UTC.

=== ISS Expedition 6 ===
Bowersox served as the commander of Expedition 6 to the International Space Station (ISS). Alongside him were crewmates Nikolai Budarin and Donald Pettit. As commander, Bowersox was responsible for the overall success of the mission and the safety of his crew.

The expedition commenced with the crew&#x27;s launch aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; from Launch Complex 39A on November 23, 2002, at 00:49 UTC. They docked with the ISS on November 25, 2002, at 21:59 UTC. During their stay, the crew conducted several scientific experiments in the microgravity of space and performed two spacewalks to continue outfitting and maintenance on the ISS. Originally set to return aboard STS-114, the Expedition 6 crew&#x27;s descent was shifted to the Russian Soyuz TMA-1 spacecraft due to the &quot;Columbia&quot; tragedy. They landed near Arkalyk, Kazakhstan, on May 4, 2003, at 02:04 UTC.

== After NASA ==
Bowersox retired from NASA on September 30, 2006. On June 16, 2009 he was appointed vice president of Astronaut Safety and Mission Assurance at SpaceX. He was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame on June 8, 2010, four days after the first successful launch of SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon 9 rocket.

It was reported on January 17, 2012, that Bowersox resigned from SpaceX in late December 2011.

Bowersox appeared on three episodes of the American TV show &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. Series 3, Episode 24, titled &quot;Reality Bytes&quot;, aired 18 May 1994.

== NASA administration ==

In July 2019, Bowersox became NASA&#x27;s Acting Associate Administrator for the Human Exploration Operations Mission Directorate, replacing William Gerstenmaier. In May 2020, Bowersox again became NASA&#x27;s Acting Associate Administrator for the Human Exploration Operations Mission Directorate, replacing Douglas Loverro.

In May 2023, Bowersox was named the associate administrator of the Space Operations Mission Directorate.

== Awards and decorations ==
Bowersox is a recipient of the National Defense Service Medal with award star, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon and NASA Space Flight Medal with four award stars.

On October 26, 1995, Bowersox threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Game 5 of the 1995 World Series.

<doc id="467708" wikidata="Q495953" url="?curid=467708" title="Korean Air Flight 858">
<text>Korean Air Flight 858 was a scheduled international passenger flight between Baghdad, Iraq, and Seoul, South Korea. On 29 November 1987, the aircraft flying that route exploded in mid-air upon the detonation of a bomb planted inside an overhead storage bin in the airplane&#x27;s passenger cabin by two North Korean agents.

The agents, acting upon orders from the North Korean government, planted the device before disembarking from the aircraft during the first stop-over, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. While the aircraft was flying over the Andaman Sea to its second stop-over, in Bangkok, Thailand, the bomb detonated and destroyed the Korean Air Boeing 707-3B5C. Everyone aboard the airliner was killed, a total of 104 passengers and 11 crew members (almost all were South Koreans). The attack occurred 34 years after the Korean Armistice Agreement that ended the hostilities of the Korean War on 27 July 1953.The two bombers were traced to Bahrain, where they both took ampules of cyanide hidden in cigarettes when they realized they were about to be taken into custody. The man died, but the woman, Kim Hyon-hui, survived and later confessed to the bombing. She was sentenced to death after being put on trial for the attack, but was later pardoned by the President of South Korea, Roh Tae-woo because it was deemed that she had been brainwashed in North Korea. Kim&#x27;s testimony implicated Kim Jong Il, who at that time was the future leader of North Korea, as the person ultimately responsible for the incident. The United States Department of State specifically refers to the bombing of KAL 858 as a &quot;terrorist act&quot; and, except between 2008 and 2017, has included North Korea on its State Sponsors of Terrorism list.

Since the attack, diplomatic relations between North Korea and South Korea have not significantly improved, although some progress has been made in the form of four Inter-Korean summits. Kim Hyon-hui later released a book, &quot;The Tears of My Soul&quot;, in which she recalled being trained in an espionage school run by the North Korean army, and being told by her superiors that Kim Jong Il personally gave the order for the attack. She was branded a traitor by North Korea and became a critic of North Korea after seeing South Korea. Kim now resides in exile, and under constant tight security, fearing that the North Korean government wants to kill her. &quot;Being a culprit, I do have a sense of agony with which I must fight&quot;, she said at a press conference in 1990. &quot;In that sense I must still be a prisoner or a captive—of a sense of guilt.&quot;

== Background ==
On 12 November 1987, two North Korean agents, Kim Sung-Il (김승일, 金勝一) and Kim Hyon-hui, traveled from Pyongyang, North Korea, on an airliner to Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union. From there, the agents left for Budapest, Hungary, the following morning, where they stayed in the house of a North Korean agent for six days. On 18 November, the pair traveled to Vienna, Austria, by car. After crossing the Austrian border, the guidance officer with whom they had stayed in Budapest gave the pair two forged Japanese passports, posing as tourists, father Hachiya Shinichi (蜂谷眞一) and daughter Hachiya Mayumi (蜂谷眞由美) staying in the Am Parkring Hotel in Vienna, the two purchased tickets from Austrian Airlines for flights that would take them from Vienna to Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia), then on to Baghdad, Abu Dhabi, and finally Bahrain. They also purchased tickets from Abu Dhabi to Rome, Italy, for use in escaping after planting the bomb on the KAL flight.

On 27 November, two guidance officers who had arrived in Yugoslavia by train from Vienna gave them the time bomb, a Panasonic transistor radio made in Japan, which contained explosives, a detonator, and a bottle of liquid explosive intended to intensify the blast, disguised as a liquor bottle. The next day, they left Belgrade for Saddam International Airport, Baghdad, Iraq, on an Iraqi Airways flight. At the airport, they waited three hours and 30 minutes for the arrival of KAL 858—the target of their operation—which took off at around 11:30 p.m. The two bombers planted the improvised explosive device above their seats, 7B and 7C, and disembarked the aircraft at Abu Dhabi International Airport.

After the attack, the bombers attempted to fly from Abu Dhabi to Amman, Jordan—the first leg of their planned escape route—but there were complications with airport authorities regarding their travel visas; therefore, they were forced to fly to Bahrain, where they agreed they would travel to Rome. However, the authorities there became suspicious about their travel movements and the bombers&#x27; passports were identified as forgeries at the airport in Bahrain. Realising that they were about to be taken into custody, they both attempted suicide by ingesting cyanide hidden inside cigarettes. Kim Sung-il (as Hachiya Shinichi (蜂谷眞一)) was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead, but the female, 25-year-old Kim Hyon-hui (as Hachiya Mayumi (蜂谷眞由美)), survived. The body of Kim Sung-il was sent to South Korea and subsequently buried in the Cemetery for North Korean and Chinese Soldiers.

==Aircraft==
The aircraft operating Korean Air Flight 858 was a Boeing 707-3B5C, registered . It made its first flight in 1971 , and at the time of its destruction, the aircraft was 16 years old and had accumulated 36,000 flying hours. Around a month before the attack, it had been recently repainted in the new Korean Air livery with an official airline sticker for the upcoming 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.

==Flight and explosion==
The aircraft took off from Saddam International Airport (later renamed Baghdad International Airport) in Baghdad, Iraq around 11:30 p.m. (20:30 UTC), flying to Gimpo International Airport in Gangseo-gu, Seoul, South Korea, with stops at Abu Dhabi International Airport in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok, Thailand.

On the second leg of the flight, from Abu Dhabi to Thailand, KAL 858 was carrying 104 passengers and 11 crew members. At around 2:05 p.m. Korean Standard Time (05:05 UTC), nine hours after the bomb had been planted and near the end of the flight, the bomb detonated and the aircraft crashed into the Andaman Sea () west of the Burmese coast, killing all 115 on board. The pilot transmitted his final radio message shortly before the explosion: &quot;We expect to arrive in Bangkok on time. Time and location normal.&quot;

One hundred thirteen of the people aboard were South Korean nationals, along with an Indian national and a Lebanese national. Many of the 113 South Korean nationals were young workers who were returning to their home country after working for several years in the construction industry in the Middle East. A South Korean diplomat, who worked at the embassy in Baghdad, and his wife, were also aboard the flight, though it is not known if they were the prime targets of the attack. Wreckage from the flight was found inland in Thailand around from where the detonation is thought to have occurred. The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were not located.

==Investigation==
According to testimony at a United Nations Security Council meeting, on 15 December 1987, Kim was transferred to Seoul, South Korea, where she recovered from the poison and, initially, said she was a Chinese orphan who grew up in Japan and said that she was not connected to the attack. Authorities grew more suspicious when, while being questioned in Bahrain, she attacked a police officer and attempted to grab his firearm, before being apprehended. At the hearing, the main evidence against Kim was the cigarettes, which, analysis showed, were the type used by a number of other North Korean agents apprehended in South Korea. Another notable evidence against Kim was the teeth of her comrade Kim Sung Il, who had cavities which had been filled with soldered lead, a common method of cavity treatment in dentistry in North Korea.
Speaking at the United Nations Security Council, Choi Young-jin, representing South Korea, said that after eight days of interrogation in South Korea, she was permitted to see a film of life in the country on a television screen, and realized that &quot;life ... on the streets of Seoul was entirely different from what she had been led to believe.&quot; She had been taught that South Korea was an American puppet state that was fraught with poverty and corruption. However, when she saw how South Koreans actually lived, Choi said, &quot;she began to realize that what she had been told while living in the North was totally untrue.&quot; Kim then &quot;threw herself into the arms of a female investigator&quot; and confessed to the bombing. In Korean, she said, &quot;Forgive me. I am sorry. I will tell you everything,&quot; and said that she had been &quot;exploited as a tool for North Korean terrorist activities&quot;, and made a detailed and voluntary confession.

The escape route, she said, was to be from Abu Dhabi via Amman to Rome, but the pair were diverted to Bahrain due to visa complications. She added that she had been travelling undercover for three years, preparing for the attack. Kim told investigators that when she was sixteen, she was chosen by the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea and trained in a number of languages. Three years later, she was educated at a secret and elite espionage school run by the North Korean Army, where she was trained to kill with her hands and feet and to use rifles and grenades. Training at the school involved enduring several years of gruelling physical and psychological conditioning. In 1987, aged 25, Kim was ordered to detonate a bomb aboard a South Korean jetliner, an attack that she was told would reunify her divided country forever.

In January 1988, Kim announced at a press conference held by the Agency for National Security Planning, the South Korean secret services agency, that both she and her partner were North Korean operatives. She said that they had left a radio containing 350 grams of C-4 explosive and a liquor bottle containing approximately 700 ml of PLX explosive, with a timer set to go off for nine hours after departure from Baghdad, in an overhead rack in the passenger cabin of the aircraft. Kim expressed remorse for her actions and asked for the forgiveness of the families of those who had died. She also said that the order for the bombing had been &quot;personally penned&quot; by Kim Jong Il, the son of North Korean supreme leader Kim Il Sung, who had wanted to destabilize the South Korean government, disrupt its upcoming 1988 parliamentary elections, and frighten international teams from attending the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul later that year. &quot;It is natural that I should be punished and killed a hundred times for my sin,&quot; she said. Writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on 15 January 1988, journalist Peter Maass stated that it was not clear to him if Kim was coerced in her remarks or was motivated by remorse for her actions. Kim was subsequently sentenced to execution for the bombing of KAL 858, but she was later pardoned by the President of South Korea, Roh Tae-woo. &quot;The persons who ought to be on trial here are the leaders of North Korea,&quot; he said. &quot;This child is as much a victim of this evil regime as the passengers aboard KAL 858.&quot;

=== Possible discovery of aircraft wreckage ===
In January 2020, a South Korean television news team from Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation reported that they may have found the main wreckage at a depth of under the Andaman Sea. Tipped off by local fishing crews, they conducted sonar scans which found a wing-shaped object long and a long section believed to be fuselage. Grainy images from underwater cameras were shown on South Korean TV and, although there was no official confirmation that this was KAL 858 or its location, some families of the victims held a news conference demanding the fuselage be salvaged.

==Aftermath==
===North Korea===

The United States State Department specifically refers to the bombing of KAL 858 as a &quot;terrorist act&quot; and, except between 2008 and 2017, has included North Korea on its State Sponsors of Terrorism list based on the results of the South Korean investigation. Charles E. Redman, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, said in January 1988 that the incident was an &quot;act of mass murder,&quot; adding that the administration had &quot;concluded that the evidence of North Korean culpability is compelling. We call on all nations to condemn North Korea for this terrorist act.&quot; The action was discussed at length in at least two United Nations Security Council meetings, where the allegations and evidence was aired by all sides, but no resolution was passed. North Korea continues to deny involvement in the attack on KAL 858, saying that the incident was a &quot;fabrication&quot; by South Korea and other countries.

Kim Jong Il became the leader of North Korea in 1994, succeeding his father. In 2001, right-wing activists and relatives of the victims killed in the attack demanded that Kim Jong Il be arrested for terrorism offences when he visited Seoul later in the year. Two petitions were filed against him, with the activists and relatives stating that there was strong evidence—namely Kim&#x27;s testimony—to suggest he was ultimately responsible for the bombing. They also called for him to make a public apology for the incident and formally compensate the victims&#x27; families. The leader of a right-wing South Korean group, lawyer Lee Chul-sung, said, &quot;Kim Jong Il must be arrested and punished if he comes to Seoul without admitting his criminal acts and offering an apology and compensation.&quot; Kim Jong Il was not arrested, however. He died in December 2011, and was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong Un.

===Kim Hyon-hui===
In 1993, William Morrow and Company published &quot;The Tears of My Soul,&quot; Kim&#x27;s account of how she was trained as a North Korean espionage agent and carried out the bombing of KAL 858. As a gesture of contrition for her crime, she donated all of the proceeds from this book to the families of the victims of KAL 858. The book details her early training and life in China, Macao, and across Europe, carrying out the bombing, her consequent trial, reprieve, and integration into South Korea. In the book, Kim states that Kim Jong Il masterminded the bombing, and gave the order to carry out the attack. It is also believed that Kim Jong Il masterminded the Rangoon bombing of 1983, in which North Korea attempted to assassinate South Korean president, Chun Doo-hwan. Her story has also been turned into a motion picture, &quot;Mayumi&quot;, directed by Shin Sang-ok in 1990.

In 2010, Kim Hyon-hui visited Japan, where she met the families of Japanese people abducted by North Korea during the 1970s and 1980s who were forced to teach North Korean spies to disguise themselves as Japanese—whom, it was reported, may have trained Kim Hyon-hui. The Japanese government waived immigration rules in order for the visit to take place since Kim is regarded as a criminal in the country for her use of the false Japanese passport in the attack. The Japanese press, however, criticized the visit, for which security was tight over fears that she might be attacked. Kim arrived in the country on a private jet chartered by the Japanese government and was ushered into a car shielded by large umbrellas. During the visit, she stayed in a holiday home owned by Yukio Hatoyama, prime Minister of Japan. Kim today resides in an undisclosed location and remains under constant protection for fear of reprisals, from either victims&#x27; families or the North Korean government, which has described her as a traitor to their cause.

===In South Korean politics===
In 2007, an association of families of victims released their suspicions on the official version of the events. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission investigated the matter and found out that the bombing was &quot;not a manipulation&quot; by the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS). In 2016, Kim Kwang-jin, a member of the National Assembly raised the suspicion that the bombing was done by the NIS during the unsuccessful filibuster of the anti-terrorism bill.

===Continuing tension===

The tension between North Korea and South Korea has not subsided since the signing of the armistice in 1953, and no formal peace treaty permanently ending the conflict has been signed. In 2000, however, both countries held the first Inter-Korean summit, in which the leaders of both countries signed a joint declaration, stating that they would hold a second summit, in 2007. Furthermore, both countries were involved in military and ministerial discussions in Pyongyang, Seoul and Jeju Island in that year. On 2 October 2007, South Korean president, Roh Moo-hyun, walked across the Korean Demilitarized Zone in travelling to Pyongyang for talks with Kim Jong Il. Both leaders reaffirmed the spirit of the 2000 joint declaration and had discussions on various issues related to realizing the advancement of south–north relations, peace on the Korean Peninsula, common prosperity of the Korean people, and the reunification of Korea. On 4 October 2007, South Korean president, Roh Moo-hyun, and North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, signed the peace declaration. The document called for international talks to replace the armistice, which ended the Korean War, with a permanent peace treaty.
