<text>Katrina and the Waves were a British rock band formed in Cambridge in 1981, widely known for their 1985 hit &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot;. They won the 1997 Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot;.

==History==
===Pre-history (1975–1980)===
The band&#x27;s earliest incarnation was as the Waves, a group that played in and around Cambridge, from 1975 to 1977. The Waves featured guitarist Kimberley Rew and drummer Alex Cooper. This incarnation of the Waves did not issue any recordings, and broke up when Rew left to join The Soft Boys.

A more direct ancestor of Katrina and the Waves was the band Mama&#x27;s Cookin&#x27;, a pop cover band from Feltwell. This band, founded in 1978, featured American Katrina Leskanich on vocals and keyboards, and fellow American, Vince de la Cruz on vocals and lead guitar. During a school production at RAF Lakenheath, Vince had noticed Katrina, and asked her to join his band.

By late 1980, Alex Cooper had joined the band on drums, with Bob Jakins on bass. Mama&#x27;s Cookin&#x27; proceeded to gig steadily in England over the next two years, specialising in covers of songs by American acts such as Heart, Foreigner, Linda Ronstadt and ZZ Top.

===Early days as The Waves (1981–1982)===
When The Soft Boys broke up in 1981, Rew contacted his old Wave-mate Cooper to see about renewing their musical partnership. Cooper convinced Rew to join Mama&#x27;s Cookin&#x27;, and the five-piece group (Leskanich/Rew/Cooper/de la Cruz/Jakins) was quickly renamed the Waves after the band Rew and Cooper had been in together in the mid-1970s.

The Waves were initially fronted by singer/songwriter/guitarist Rew, who brought a wealth of original material to the band. Leskanich, meanwhile, originally only sang lead vocals on the cover tunes in the band&#x27;s repertoire. However, over the first year of the Waves&#x27; existence, Rew began to write material for Leskanich to sing, and she was soon the primary vocalist.

The Waves made their initial recorded appearances on a 1982 single (&quot;The Nightmare&quot;/&quot;Hey, War Pig!&quot;); both tracks were included on the 1982 Rew solo album called &quot;The Bible of Bop&quot;. The Waves then issued their debut EP &quot;Shock Horror!&quot; later in 1982; Rew and Leskanich both sang lead, about 50/50. Around this time, bassist Jakins left the band, and de la Cruz took over on bass. Now a quartet, the Waves issued the single &quot;Brown Eyed Son&quot; in the UK in August 1982 before permanently renaming themselves Katrina and the Waves.

===Early Canadian success (1983–1984)===
In early 1983, the fledgling band recorded, at their own expense, an album of their original material designed to be sold at gigs. Rew wrote all the songs on this album, and Leskanich sang eight of the album&#x27;s 10 tracks. (Rew sang lead on the other two.)

The album was shopped around to various labels, but only Attic Records in Canada responded with an offer. Consequently, although they were based in England, Katrina and the Waves&#x27; first album &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; was released only in Canada.

The album garnered enough critical attention and radio play (especially for the title track) to merit a Canadian tour. In 1984, the group released a follow-up album in Canada (&quot;Katrina and the Waves 2&quot;), with Leskanich now handling all the lead vocals. Rew was still the primary songwriter, but de la Cruz was also responsible for a few songs, including the Canadian airplay hit &quot;Mexico&quot;.

Also in 1984, the band received their first ever airplay on BBC Radio 1 when DJ Richard Skinner played the track &quot;Que te quiero&quot;, whilst their song &quot;Going Down to Liverpool&quot; was covered by the Bangles, which added to their profile. With the group building a fan base with their recordings and extensive touring, major label interest began to build, and Katrina and the Waves eventually signed an international deal with Capitol Records in 1985.

===&quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; and international success (1985–1989)===
For the first Capitol album, the band re-recorded, remixed, or overdubbed 10 songs from their earlier Canadian releases to create their self-titled international debut album in 1985.

The &quot;Katrina and the Waves&quot; album was a substantial critical and commercial success, and the group had a worldwide hit with the song &quot;Walking on Sunshine,&quot; (no. 9 US, no. 8 UK, a completely re-recorded, and substantially rearranged version of the song when compared to its initial 1983 Canada-only release). A Grammy Award nomination for Best New Artist followed, as did constant touring, both of which helped to spur moderate sales of new releases.

A follow-up single to &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; called &quot;Do You Want Crying&quot; (written by de la Cruz) also became a top 40 US hit, reaching no. 37 in the late summer of 1985.

However, the band&#x27;s follow-up album to &quot;Katrina and the Waves&quot; (simply entitled &quot;Waves&quot;) did not meet with the same measure of success, either critically or commercially. Rew wrote only two of the 10 songs on the album; de la Cruz and Leskanich wrote the rest. Drummer Cooper, interviewed some years later, claimed &quot;It was (a) mistake when we started taking over from Kimberley in the musical contribution side. The second Capitol album was awful&quot;.
The album did spin off a minor UK and US hit in the form of the Rew-penned &quot;Is That It?&quot; (no. 70 US, no. 82 UK), and &quot;Sun Street&quot; (a de la Cruz composition) was a UK top 30 hit in 1986. However, Capitol dropped the band after the &quot;Waves&quot; album.

The band subsequently recorded a 1989 album for Capitol-distributed SBK Records called &quot;Break of Hearts&quot;, a harder, more rock-oriented effort than their previous releases. The album included &quot;That&#x27;s the Way&quot; which reached no. 16 in the US (credited to Leskanich/Rew), but subsequent singles, including &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Girl&quot;, failed to chart, and the band once again were dropped from their label.

===Downturn and surprise comeback winning Eurovision (1990–1997)===
Throughout the 1990s, Katrina and the Waves recorded fairly steadily, though most releases were available only in continental Europe and/or Canada, and they issued no charting singles. They also recorded the song &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot; with Eric Burdon for the TV series &quot;China Beach&quot; in 1990.

On 3 May 1997, the band won the Eurovision Song Contest 1997 for the United Kingdom with the song &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot;. The song was written years earlier to celebrate an anniversary of a local branch of Samaritans; one of the members of the charity organization suggested the song be submitted. Although the band had nearly forgotten about the song, never releasing it on an album because it &quot;felt too Eurovision-y&quot;, the band eventually submitted it last-minute. The song won the contest by a then-record margin of 70 points over the Irish runner-up. &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; became Katrina and the Waves&#x27; biggest-ever UK hit, peaking at no. 3 in the UK Singles Chart.

In a 2020 interview, Katrina Leskanich revealed that, as an American national winning the Eurovision Song Contest for the UK, she was the target of criticism, with some people arguing that UK should have instead sent an English singer to the contest; she also claimed she was asked if she could &quot;try and talk like an English person&quot;. Leskanich had moved to the UK in 1976, at the age of 16.

===Dissolution (1998–1999)===
Despite their return to the public eye in the UK, Katrina and the Waves were not able to follow up &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; with another hit, and Leskanich left the group in 1998 after several disagreements within the band. Legal wrangling followed, preventing Leskanich from using the band name. Though attempts were made by the Waves to find a new &quot;Katrina&quot; to front the group, the three remaining group members eventually dissolved the band to pursue individual careers in 1999.

===Impact of Hurricane &quot;Katrina&quot; (2005)===
When Hurricane Katrina and its storm surge devastated much of the U.S. Gulf Coast on 29 August 2005, the MSNBC news program &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; dubbed its coverage of the storm &quot;Katrina and the Waves&quot;; the name also appeared in numerous headlines and blog postings. A &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter contacted Katrina Leskanich, who said: &quot;The first time I opened the paper and saw &#x27;Katrina kills 9,&#x27; it was a bit of a shock...I hope that the true spirit of &#x27;Walking on Sunshine&#x27; will prevail. I would hate for the title to be tinged with sadness, and I will have to do my own part to help turn that around.&quot; She also stated that she hoped that &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; would become an anthem for the Gulf Coast&#x27;s recovery.

===Later years (2010–2013)===
2010 marked the 25th anniversary of the release of &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; and a series of back-catalogue reissues and a re-recorded version of the track were released. A free download of one of the tracks from Kimberley Rew&#x27;s solo album &quot;The Bible of Bop&quot; was given away in March 2010 from the band&#x27;s website. Katrina Leskanich released &quot;The Live Album&quot; in July 2010 – a mix of Katrina and the Waves hits and new songs recorded in London and Germany.

In June 2011, the group threatened legal action against U.S. presidential candidate Michele Bachmann for playing their music on her campaign trail. A statement on the group&#x27;s official website reads: &quot;Katrina and the Waves would like it to be known that they do not endorse the use of &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; by Michele Bachmann and have instructed their lawyers accordingly.&quot; Leskanich stated that she wants to ban the Republican party from using the track because she does not agree with their politics.

In July 2013, Leskanich performed at the San Fermín festival in Spain for the penultimate gig of the season on Plaza del Castillo.

<doc id="472897" wikidata="Q7699999" url="?curid=472897" title="Tennessee's Partner">
<text>Tennessee&#x27;s Partner is a 1955 American Western film, directed by Allan Dwan, written by: Graham Baker, D.D. Beauchamp, Milton Krims and Teddi Sherman, with uncredited rewrites by Dwan, and starring: John Payne, Ronald Reagan, Rhonda Fleming and Coleen Gray.

The film was released by RKO Radio Pictures, which was then owned by industrialist Howard Hughes. While the film is based upon one of Bret Harte&#x27;s most popular short stories, &quot;Tennessee’s Pardner&quot;, it departs significantly from the original storyline. The 1869 Harte story has also been filmed as &quot;Tennessee&#x27;s Pardner&quot; (1916), &quot;The Flaming Forties&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Golden Princess&quot; (1925).

==Plot==
Tennessee is a gambler and partners with Duchesse Elizabeth Farnham. Tennessee has few friends and makes enemies by winning most of the time. One night Tennessee is ambushed by Clifford, who lost a lot of money to Tennessee. A stranger who calls himself Cowpoke sees this and saves Tennessee. Cowpoke is in love with Goldie, who arrives on a riverboat. Tennessee recognizes Goldie from his past. Cowpoke gives Goldie $5,000 in gold. Tennessee is torn between telling Cowpoke about her past or keeping quiet. 

Reynolds, also a gambler, arrives on the same boat as Goldie, planning to kill Tennessee. He gambles with Tennessee. A crowd assembles to watch them play. Reynolds accuses Tennessee of cheating. Reynolds draws a gun and Tennessee shoots him, in self defence. 

Tennessee visits Goldie and kisses her. He tries to persuade her to go to San Francisco with him, showing her the $50,000 he made at the card table. She agrees. He tells her he’ll meet her at the riverboat. When Cowpoke arrives to meet Goldie, Duchesse tells him she left with her luggage and Tennessee. The town is aware and Cowpoke is humiliated and feels betrayed. Tennessee escorts her onto the boat, then leaves her there. 

Cowpoke plans to follow Tennessee and kill him. He goes to work his claim to get money to travel after Tennessee. Cowpoke meets up with Grubstake, who has made his strike. Grubstake goes to Duchesse, who tells her girls to give him a bath. Tennessee returns to Duchesse and explains that he sent Goldie away to protect Cowpoke. He has Cowpoke’s $5,000. 

Tennessee takes Grubstake away from the crowd and puts him to bed. Since Tennessee staked him, he’s entitled to a share of the strike. He hides Grubstake’s map, and goes to see Cowpoke. He yells Cowpoke the truth about Goldie. Cowpoke hits Tennessee but he refuses to hit him. He gives Cowpoke his $5,000 and explains he sent her away to protect him. 

Grubstakes is killed and Tennessee is suspected. The sheriff goes looking for Tennessee with a posse. Duchesse warns Tennessee to leave. Cowpoke stays behind to hold off the posse, which is really the gold hungry mines. Cowpoke holds them off with a gun, giving Tennessee a chance to explain. The sheriff takes Tennessee back to his place, but the map has been stolen. Cowpoke provides Tennessee with an alibi but the sheriff is skeptical and arrests Tennessee. Cowpoke, who drew the map, knows where the gold is. He and Tennessee disarm the deputy and escape. They go to Duchesse to ensure she and the girls are OK, then go to the mine. They find a horse there and think that whoever is there killed Grubstake. It’s Turner and a gunfight ensues. The sheriff and deputy arrive. Turner surrenders, then pulls another gun, aiming for Tennessee. Cowpoke blocks the bullet, and dies. Tennessee chases after Turner. The sheriff stops Tennessee from killing him. Tennessee looks at Cowpoke and says “I never even knew his name”.

Tennessee marries Duchesse and they leave on the riverboat.
==Cast==

==Legacy==
This film inspired one of the greatest hits of The Four Seasons. As the character based on Bob Gaudio explains in the musical &quot;Jersey Boys:&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m watching the million dollar movie. Some cheesy John Payne western. He hauls off and smacks Rhonda Fleming across the mouth and says: &#x27;What do you think of that ?&#x27;. She looks up at him defiant, proud, eyes glistening – and she says: &#x27;Big girls don&#x27;t cry&#x27;.&quot;

LCV says that it &quot;advocates for sound environmental laws and policies, holds elected officials accountable for their votes and actions, and elects pro-environment candidates.&quot; The organization pursues its goals through voter education, voter mobilization, and direct contributions to political candidates. LCV includes 29 state affiliates. LCV was founded in 1970 by environmentalist Marion Edey, with support from David Brower. The group&#x27;s current president is Gene Karpinski. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and has over two million members.

== History ==
The League of Conservation Voters was founded by Marion Edey, then a young congressional staffer, who proposed a non-partisan, national pressure group for environmentalists &quot;analogous to a political party&quot; but endorsing Democrats and Republicans in a 1969 letter to David Brower, soon after he resigned from the Sierra Club. Brower strongly endorsed Edey&#x27;s idea and came up with the name League of Conservation Voters, insisting that Edey run the new organization. The plan to form LCV as an arm of Brower&#x27;s new environmental organization, Friends of the Earth, was announced in September 1969. However, as it would have violated the Federal Corrupt Practices Act for LCV to be a subsidiary of a non-profit corporation like Friends of the Earth, Edey launched the organization as an independent political committee in 1970.

That fall, she hired as her first employee Research Director James Rathlesberger to cover presidential politics beginning in 1971 while she concentrated on congressional. In 1972, they published environmental policy profiles of the leading presidential candidates and Rathlesberger edited an LCV Report, &quot;Nixon and the Environment&quot; (Village Voice Books, 1972). The profiles were widely covered in the news as was the book by reviews, raising the level of these issues in presidential politics. Not a factor given the controversies of the 1972 campaign, they were by 1976 with Jimmy Carter’s rise.

==Activities==
The organization&#x27;s main activities include voter education, voter mobilization, tracking voting records, endorsing or opposing candidates for political office, and financially contributing to political campaigns.

The related League of Conservation Voters Action Fund (LCVAF) financially supports political candidates, most of whom are members of the Democratic Party. According to OpenSecrets, LCVAF was the top-spending, non-disclosing liberal group in the 2012 election cycle, investing about $11 million in political advertisements. LCV spent a total of $36 million in 2012.

LCV annually names a &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot;, a list of politicians whom the group aims to defeat because of their voting records on conservation issues. The original &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; list was developed in partnership with Environmental Action in 1970.

LCV strongly opposed many of President George W. Bush&#x27;s environmental policies.

In 2014, LCV and the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund launched LeadingGreen, a joint initiative to address climate change. In 2015, LeadingGreen was added to the Democracy Alliance&#x27;s funding portfolio.

LCV strongly opposed the administration of President Donald J. Trump and its environmental policies. In September 2018, the pac pledged $60 million to help green candidates. Ultimately, in the mid-term elections of 2018, the pac spent $80 million to support &quot;green&quot; candidates through its Victory Fund. They &quot;had enormous success electing its endorsed candidates in suburban districts last fall,&quot; wrote &quot;The Atlantic&quot; on January 3, 2019.

===National Environmental Scorecard===

LCV tracks the voting records of members of Congress on environmental issues in its National Environmental Scorecard, a legislative scorecard.

The average scores for members of the Democratic Party are historically higher than the scores for members of the Republican Party. According to &quot;ThinkProgress&quot;, a very low score on the Scorecard means a member of Congress has not &quot;used their time in Congress to vote with the environment in mind.&quot; In 2002, Kimberley Strassel of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial board wrote that &quot;Democratic politics...is what really drives the league&#x27;s scorecard.&quot;

In a 2012 report, the non-profit Rachel&#x27;s Network examined the Scorecard scores for male and female members of Congress in the 107th through the 111th Congresses (2001 to 2010). The group found that &quot;women in Congress vote for legislation supporting clean air, clean water, renewable energy, climate action, and public health much more often than their male counterparts.&quot; The report found that some of the difference was attributable to the fact that there were &quot;more women Democrats in both houses of Congress than there are women Republicans,&quot; and Democrats favor more pro-environmental policies, but also found that &quot;the difference in voting patterns still persists when gender is isolated within each political party.&quot; The report also found that &quot;the gap between Republican men and women narrowed after the 2004 election cycle, which could be attributable to increased partisan pressures.&quot;

The Scorecard has been cited by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Bloomberg News, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, &quot;HuffPost&quot;, and &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine.

In 1998, scholar Anne Y. Ilinitch and collaborators used the Scorecard &quot;to identify Senators and Representatives with unsupportive environmental voting records&quot; in evaluated corporate political contributions as a measure of corporate environmental performance. In 2004, researchers at the School of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences at Auburn University averaged Scorecard scores across a state&#x27;s congressional delegation as a proxy variable for the &quot;green-ness&quot; of constituents, and found no significant relationship with the number of Endangered Species Act listings in a state. In 2012, Robert Brulle and his collaborators investigated factors affecting U.S. public concern about the threat of climate change and found that &quot;the message sent to the public by the Republican voting record on environmental bills is very influential...This result provides strong confirmation of the role of elite cues and their influence on public concern about climate change. In an extremely partisan environment, Republican votes against environmental bills legitimate public opinion opposed to action on climate change.&quot;

<text>HMS &quot;Intrepid&quot; was one of nine s built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s.

==Description==
The I-class ships were improved versions of the preceding H-class. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and were intended to give a maximum speed of . &quot;Intrepid&quot; only reached a speed of from during her sea trials. The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . Their crew numbered 145 officers and ratings.

The ships mounted four 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The I class was fitted with two above-water quintuple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 16 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. &quot;Intrepid&quot; was one of the four I-class destroyers fitted with minelaying equipment in late 1938 – January 1939 at Malta. This consisted of mounts for rails on the deck on which to carry the mines and an electric winch to move the mines down the rails. A pair of sponsons were added to the stern to allow the mines to clear the propellers when dropped into the sea. &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; guns and both sets of torpedo tubes were modified to allow them to be removed to compensate for the weight of the mines. The ships could carry a maximum of 72 mines. The I-class ships were fitted with the ASDIC sound detection system to locate submarines underwater.

==Construction and career==

In the Second World War, &quot;Intrepid&quot; attacked and sank the south-west of Ireland on 14 October 1939 in company with the destroyers and . During naval manoeuvres on the 17 March 1940 &quot;Intrepid&quot; collided with the Leith-based fishing trawler MV &quot;Ocean Drift&quot;, sinking the smaller ship and killing two of her crew but rescuing the other eight &quot;Intrepid&quot; participated in the pursuit and destruction of the in May 1941, and in Operation Pedestal, the escorting of a convoy to Malta in August 1942. &quot;Intrepid&quot; was adopted by the town of Uxbridge in 1942 to raise funds for the ship&#x27;s costs. &quot;Intrepid&quot; was attacked by German Junkers Ju 88 aircraft and sank in Leros harbour in the Aegean Sea on 26 September 1943.

<text>The Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences is the heart of the undergraduate program and grants the majority of Stanford University&#x27;s degrees. The School has 27 departments and 20 interdisciplinary degree-granting programs. The School was officially created in 1948, from the merger of the Schools of Biological Sciences, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Those schools date from the mid-1920s when the university first organized individual departments into schools.

==Departments==

The school is divided into three divisions: Humanities and Arts, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences.

=== Humanities and Arts ===
* Art &amp; Art History—One of the original University departments under the name Drawing (1891), Drawing and Painting (1892-1900), back to Drawing (1901–1907), Graphic Arts (1908–1910), Graphic Art (1911–1913, 1927–1947), then Art and Architecture (1948–1969), Art (1970–?) and finally its current name.
* Classics—Stanford started with separate departments for Latin and Greek but these were merged in 1921
* Drama—Started as Public Speaking in 1927 became Speech and Drama in 1937 and Drama in 1971
* East Asian Languages and Cultures
* English—one of the original departments but under the name English Language and Literature
* History—one of the original departments
* Linguistics—established in 1971
* Music—established in 1936
* Philosophy—established sometime in the 1890s
* Religious Studies—started in 1941 as the department of Religion

Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages
* Comparative Literature
* French and Italian—one of the original departments under the name Romance Languages which became Romanic Languages. Became French and Italian in 1963.
* German Studies—one of the original departments under the name Germanic Languages
* Iberian &amp; Latin American Cultures
* Slavic Languages and Literature—established in 1926

=== Natural Sciences ===

* Applied Physics—established in 1969
* Biology
* Chemistry—one of the original departments
* Mathematics—one of the original departments
* Physics—one of the original departments
* Statistics—established in 1936

The current Biology department was formed by merging Botany, Zoology, Entomology, and Physiology to form Biological Sciences. The name of this department was changed to Biology in 2009.

=== Social Sciences ===

* Anthropology
* Communication—established in 1927 as Journalism
* Economics—established in 1892 as Economics and Social Sciences
* Political Science
* Psychology—one of the original departments with Frank Angell serving as its first chair. From 1922 to 1942, Lewis Terman served as its chair. In 2015, it was ranked as #1 in the country among all psychology graduate programs in the United States.
* Science, Technology, and Society—interdisciplinary, with both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science programs
* Sociology

Stanford was set up with a Political Science department but that was almost immediately renamed Economics and Social Science. The forerunner of the current Political Science department was established in 1918.

Sociology and Anthropology were originally one department established in 1948. They split in 1957. Anthropology itself was split into Anthropological Sciences and Cultural and Social Anthropology from
1999 to 2007 but merged again.

Notable faculty in these departments other than those mentioned above include:
*Albert Bandura (1925–2021), David Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social Science 
*Carol Dweck (born 1946), Lewis and Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology (2004–)
*Phillip Zimbardo (born 1933), professor of psychology (1968-200), known for the Stanford Prison Experiment
*Joseph Greenberg (1915–2001), Ray Lyman Wilbur Professor of Social Science, known for his classification of the Niger–Congo languages

==Core courses==
At times Stanford has required undergraduate students to take core courses in various subjects in the humanities and sciences. Some of the core courses include
* Western Civilization (&quot;Western Civ&#x27;) taken by all freshmen—first established in 1935 and continued until the mid-1960s.
* Western Culture (1980–1988)—freshmen took courses in both European and non-European cultures with “a substantial historical dimension” and include works by women and minorities. 
* Cultures, Ideas and Values (CIV) (1988–2000)
* Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) (2000–2012), a core freshman course sequence which consisted of one fall-quarter course followed by a 2-quarter pair of courses during the winter and spring quarters. Fall quarter courses were interdisciplinary while winter-spring focused on a specific disciplinary area.
* Thinking Matters (2012–2016)
* Ways of Thinking / Ways of Doing (2016–present)

<text>Ross Friedman (born January 3, 1954), also known as Ross the Boss, is an American guitarist, best known as a founding member of both the punk band the Dictators and the heavy metal band Manowar.

==History==
Friedman was born in the Bronx, New York City, and formed the punk rock band the Dictators with Andy Shernoff in New Paltz, New York, in 1973. Prior to this, Friedman had played in a local band, Total Crudd. After recording three albums with the Dictators, Friedman went to France and worked for one year in Fabienne Shine&#x27;s band Shakin&#x27; Street. On Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; tour in 1980 (on which Shakin&#x27; Street were the support act), Friedman was introduced to bass player Joey DeMaio by Ronnie James Dio. Later in 1980, Friedman and DeMaio formed Manowar, with whom he recorded six albums before DeMaio asked him to leave the band after the 1988 album &quot;Kings of Metal&quot;.

===Timeline===
In 1990, Friedman joined Manitoba&#x27;s Wild Kingdom with fellow Dictators Andy Shernoff and Handsome Dick Manitoba. With drummer J. P. Patterson the band released the album &quot;...And You?&quot; to critical acclaim. The album was in heavy rotation on MTV.

In 1994, Friedman had a blues rock band called &quot;Heyday&quot; and in 1999 CMC records released the Spinatras album &quot;@Midnight.com&quot;, a band whom Friedman has described as &quot;The Dictators meet Cheap Trick&quot;.

The Dictators started playing again in 1996, touring heavily. In 2001, with original rhythm guitar player Scott Kempner now back in the fold, the band released their album &quot;D.F.F.D.&quot; which they then toured to support in the US and Europe. A resulting live album was released from the European tour, entitled &quot;Viva Dictators&quot;.

In 2004, Friedman joined Albert Bouchard, the original drummer for Blue Öyster Cult, in his band Brain Surgeons. He also recorded an instrumental album with Dictators drummer JP Thunderbolt Patterson, called &quot;Thunderboss&quot;

In July 2005, Friedman joined Manowar onstage at the Earthshaker Festival; performing &quot;Metal Daze&quot; and &quot;Dark Avenger&quot; with them. At the end of the concert, he also performed &quot;Battle Hymn&quot;, with other past and present members of Manowar.

In April 2006, he played one night of early Manowar music at the Keep It True VI Festival in Germany, backed by German Manowar cover band Men of War, featuring members of German groups Ivory Night and Divinus. That band (later changed name to Ross the Boss or &quot;The RTB Band&quot;) went on to play some more festivals in Germany, Italy and Greece and then began working on new original material.

In August 2006, Thunderboss was released on Poptown Records. Thunderboss was written and arranged by J.P. Thunderbolt Patterson and featured Friedman on all 11 tracks. The CD met with some critical acclaim, but was not successful enough to keep Friedman interested in the project, so there was no supporting tour.

In October 2006, Friedman and The Dictators played Friday and Saturday nights of the closing weekend at punk rock venue CBGBs, one of the clubs where they got their start.

2007 started off with an eleven city tour of Spain with JP Patterson and their Spanish super-band &quot;The Thunderbolts&quot; which also includes members of Bummer and Sex Museum.

Friedman guested on former band-mate Fabienne Shine&#x27;s 2007 LP, Wotan&#x27;s LP &quot;Epos&quot; where he played Grand Piano on one track, and Atlantean Kodex&#x27;s 2007 EP.

Friedman&#x27;s 2008 included an appearance with Manitoba&#x27;s Wild Kingdom at the 2008 Joey Ramone Birthday Bash, performances with Shakin&#x27; Street at the Sweden Rock Festival, and a few tour dates in Spain with The Dictators. He released a new album in August with his German Metal Band under the name &quot;Ross the Boss&quot; called &quot;New Metal Leader&quot; which debuted at #99 in the German Album charts. The following month he appeared on &quot;Inner Demons&quot;, the 2nd CD by New Jersey metallers Skullshifter, playing lead guitar on the track &quot;Etched in Sand&quot;.

In August 2009, Friedman debuted his &quot;Ross the Boss&quot; band in the US at the Brooklyn, New York venue Europa, to favorable reviews.

In November 2010, Friedman and his German Metal Band released the followup to &quot;New Metal Leader&quot;, &quot;Hailstorm&quot;, which received 4.5 out of 5 stars on AllMusic.com.

In May 2011, Friedman was a special guest at the 11th Annual Joey Ramone Birthday Bash in New York city, performing, among other songs, &quot;Stop Thinking About It&quot; with fellow Dictator Andy Shernoff. In June, Friedman was invited to co-headline Venezuela&#x27;s Gillmanfest. In the coming months with the Ross the Boss band he performed at several festivals in Europe, including Masters of Rock in the Czech Republic.

Friedman also owns and manages a small business called &quot;The Cage Baseball NYC.&quot; He runs &quot;The Cage&quot; with his wife and son. His son teaches classes at &quot;The Cage,&quot; while his wife runs the clinics and manages the business when Friedman is on tour.

In early 2012, vocalist Sean Peck of Cage, guitarists Friedman and Stu Marshall, bassist Mike Davis and drummer Rhino formed a metal supergroup, Death Dealer. Death Dealer began as an online collaboration between Marshall and Peck. All they needed to tell Friedman about the project to get him on board was that Rhino was on drums. Although Friedman and Rhino are both former members of Manowar, they&#x27;d only ever played together for one song at the Earthshaker Festival in 2005. They both had always meant to do something together. In June 2013, Death Dealer released a full-length studio album called War Master. The 2015 follow up release &quot;Hallowed Ground&quot; featured drummer Steve Bolognese from Into Eternity.

He brought down the house as the surprise guest star at the 2016 Keep It True Festival with a new all-Manowar-songs &quot;Ross The Boss Band&quot; that hails from his hometown of New York City. The band includes bass player Kevin Bolembach, his nephew Lance Barnewold on drums, and singer Mike Cotoia of Fate Breaks Dawn who has a six octave range. 

On January 18, 2017, Ross was inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History for his contributions to speed metal while in Manowar.

In 2022, Ross was featured in the song &quot;Armpits of Immortals&quot; by Italian comedy heavy metal band Nanowar of Steel.

<text>Donnie Hamzik (born October 18, 1956) is an American musician and a former drummer for heavy metal band Manowar.

== Career ==
Hamzik was born in Binghamton, New York. He was discovered by Joey DeMaio in the rock club Agora Ballroom in Hollywood, FL when a mutual friend brought DeMaio down to see Hamzik play. It was not until a year later, when Manowar had secured their record deal with Liberty Records, that DeMaio and Ross the Boss went to Florida and played together with Hamzik and recorded their debut album Battle Hymns. At that point, Hamzik was officially a member of Manowar.

Hamzik left the band in 1983 and was replaced by Scott Columbus. He again appeared with Manowar on stage during &quot;Earthshaker&quot; Fest 2005 in Germany along with all other Manowar members past and present.

In 2009, Hamzik reunited with Manowar, due to personal differences between Columbus and the rest of the band. He took part in Magic Circle Festival 2009 and also recorded the EP Thunder in the Sky.

On October 15, 2010, DeMaio announced on Facebook that Hamzik was officially a member of Manowar again after a 26-year absence.

For 2017&#x27;s The Final Battle tour, Manowar replaced Hamzik with Brazilian drummer Marcus Castellani.

As a result of Marcus Castellani filling in for Hamzik, the guitarist from Castellani&#x27;s Official MANOWAR Tribute EV Martel became the next guitarist for MANOWAR.

<doc id="472924" wikidata="Q1472830" url="?curid=472924" title="HMS Imogen (D44)">
<text>HMS &quot;Imogen&quot; was a built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides as part of the Mediterranean Fleet. After the start of the Second World War the ship was transferred to Home Fleet and participated in the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940. &quot;Imogen&quot; sank two German submarines before her own sinking following an accidental collision in July 1940.

==Description==
The I-class ships were improved versions of the preceding H-class. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and were intended to give a maximum speed of . &quot;Imogen&quot; only reached a speed of from during her sea trials. The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . Their crew numbered 145 officers and ratings.

The ships mounted four 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The I class was fitted with two above-water quintuple torpedo tube mounts amidships for  torpedoes. One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 16 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. The I-class ships were fitted with the ASDIC sound detection system to locate submarines underwater.

==Construction==
The ship was ordered on 30 October 1935 from Hawthorn Leslie at Hebburn under the 1935 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 18 January 1936, launched on 30 December 1936, as the seventh Royal Navy ship to carry this name, and completed on 2 June 1937, at a contract price of £256,917, excluding items supplied by Admiralty such as armaments and communications equipment.

==Career==
&quot;Imogen&quot; was assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning and was initially based in Malta. Transferred to Gibraltar, she patrolled Spanish waters enforcing the policies of the Non-Intervention Committee during 1938. The ship was given a brief refit in Malta from 17 October–28 November 1938 and another at Sheerness Dockyard in August 1939.

At the beginning of the Second World War &quot;Imogen&quot; returned to the Mediterranean on 3 September, but she was transferred to the Western Approaches Command for convoy escort duties two days later when Italy did not enter the war.

Together with the entire 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, the ship was transferred to the Home Fleet in October. 
* With her sister ship , she sank the on 13 October after the submarine attempted to sink the freighter . 
* Whilst escorting merchant ships to Barry, &quot;Imogen&quot; rescued survivors from the ships &quot;Louisiane&quot; and &quot;Bretagne&quot;.

<text>Bella Abzug (née Savitzky; July 24, 1920 – March 31, 1998), nicknamed &quot;Battling Bella&quot;, was an American lawyer, politician, social activist, and a leader in the women&#x27;s movement. In 1971, Abzug joined other leading feminists such as Gloria Steinem, Shirley Chisholm, and Betty Friedan to found the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus. She was a leading figure in what came to be known as ecofeminism.

In 1970, Abzug&#x27;s first campaign slogan was, &quot;This woman&#x27;s place is in the House—the House of Representatives.&quot; She was later appointed to co-chair the National Commission on the Observance of International Women&#x27;s Year created by President Gerald Ford&#x27;s executive order, presided over the 1977 National Women&#x27;s Conference, and led President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s National Advisory Commission for Women. Abzug was a founder of the Commission for Women&#x27;s Equality of the American Jewish Congress.

==Early life==
Bella Savitzky was born on July 24, 1920, in New York City. Both of her parents were Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants from Chernihiv, Russian Empire (now Ukraine). Her mother, Esther (&quot;née&quot; Tanklevsky or Tanklefsky), was a homemaker who immigrated from Kozelets in 1902. Her father, Emanuel Savitzky, was a butcher who emigrated in 1906. He ran the Live and Let Live Meat Market on Ninth Avenue. Even in her youth, she was competitive and would beat other children in all sorts of competitions. She ran the cash register at her father&#x27;s deli as a young girl.

Her religious upbringing influenced her development into a feminist. According to Abzug, &quot;It was during these visits to the synagogue that I think I had my first thoughts as a feminist rebel. I didn&#x27;t like the fact that women were consigned to the back rows of the balcony.&quot; When her father died, Abzug, then 13, was told that her Orthodox synagogue did not permit women to say the (mourners&#x27;) Kaddish, since that rite was reserved for sons of the deceased. However, because her father had no sons, she went to the synagogue every morning for a year to recite the prayer, defying the tradition of her congregation&#x27;s practice of Orthodox Judaism.

Abzug graduated from Walton High School in The Bronx, where she was class president. Through high school she took violin lessons and went to Florence Marshall Hebrew High School after classes at Walton. She went on to major in political science at Hunter College of the City University of New York and simultaneously attended the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. At Hunter College, she was student council president and active in the American Student Union. Abzug first met Mim Kelber, who would go on to co-found WEDO with her, at Walton High School and they went on to attend Hunter College with one another. She later earned a law degree from Columbia University in 1944.

==Legal and political career==
Abzug was admitted to the New York Bar in 1945, at a time when very few women practiced law, and started her career in New York City at the firm of Pressman, Witt &amp; Cammer, frequently working cases in matters of labor law.

As a lawyer, she specialized in labor rights, tenants&#x27; rights, and civil liberties cases. Early on, she took on civil rights cases in the Southern United States. She appealed the case of Willie McGee, a black man convicted in 1945 of raping a white woman in Laurel, Mississippi, and sentenced to death by an all-white jury who deliberated for only two-and-a-half minutes. Abzug lost the appeal and the man was executed. Abzug was an outspoken advocate of liberal causes, including the Equal Rights Amendment, and opposition to the Vietnam War as well as the military draft. She worked for the American Civil Liberties Union and the Civil Rights Congress.

Years before she was elected to the House of Representatives, she was an early participant in Women Strike for Peace. Her political stance placed her on the master list of Nixon&#x27;s political opponents.
During the McCarthy era, she was one of the few legal attorneys willing to openly combat the House Un-American Activities Committee.

==Congressional career==

===Elections===
Nicknamed &quot;Battling Bella&quot;, in 1970 she challenged the 14-year incumbent Leonard Farbstein in the Democratic primary for a congressional district on Manhattan&#x27;s West Side. She defeated Farbstein in a considerable upset and then defeated talk show host Barry Farber in the general election. In 1972, her district was eliminated via redistricting and she chose to run against William Fitts Ryan, who also represented part of the West Side, in the Democratic primary. Ryan, although seriously ill, defeated Abzug. However, Ryan died before the general election and Abzug defeated his widow, Priscilla, at the party&#x27;s convention to choose the new Democratic nominee. In the general election Priscilla Ryan challenged Abzug on the Liberal Party line, but was unsuccessful. She was reelected easily in 1974. For her last two terms, she represented part of the Bronx as well.

===Tenure===

She was one of the first members of Congress to support gay rights, introducing the first federal gay rights bill, known as the Equality Act of 1974, with fellow Democratic New York City representative Ed Koch, who later became mayor of New York. She also chaired historic hearings on government secrecy, being the chair for the Subcommittee on Government Information and Individual Rights. She was voted by her colleagues as the third most influential member of the House as reported in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

She was the sponsor for the Equality Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) that made it unlawful to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age. She was a cosponsor of H.R.13157 that established the Clara Barton National Historic Site, the first National Parks Site dedicated to the achievements of a woman.

She was frequently verbally abusive toward staff members, including referring to Doug Ireland as a &quot;fat cocksucker.&quot;

Although hats were banned on the House floor, Abzug was known for her colorful and vibrant hats and was seldom seen without one. After being forced to remove her iconic hat before entering the House floor, Abzug once remarked that she felt &quot;naked and unrecognizable.&quot; She famously reminded all who admired them: &quot;It&#x27;s what&#x27;s under the hat that counts!&quot;
In February 1975, Abzug was part of a bipartisan delegation sent to Saigon by President Gerald Ford to assess the situation on the ground in South Vietnam near the end of the Vietnam War.

Abzug was a supporter of Zionism. As a young woman she was a member of the Socialist-Zionist youth movement of Hashomer Hatzair. In 1975, she challenged the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 (revoked in 1991 by resolution 46/86), which &quot;determine[d] that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination.&quot; Abzug said about the topic, &quot;Zionism is a liberation movement.&quot;

===Campaign for U.S. Senate===

Abzug&#x27;s career in Congress ended with an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1976, which she lost by less than one percent to the more moderate Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who had served in both the Nixon and Ford Republican presidential administrations as White House Urban Affairs Advisor, Counselor to the President, United States Ambassador to India, and United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Moynihan would go on to serve four terms in that office.

==Later life and death==

Abzug never held elected office again after leaving the House, although she remained a high-profile figure and was again a candidate on multiple occasions. She was unsuccessful in her bid to be mayor of New York City in 1977, as well as in attempts to return to the US House from the East Side of Manhattan in 1978 against Republican Bill Green, and from Westchester County, New York, in 1986 against Joe DioGuardi.

She authored two books, &quot;Bella: Ms. Abzug Goes to Washington&quot; and &quot;The Gender Gap&quot;, the latter co-authored with friend and colleague Mim Kelber.

In early 1977, President Jimmy Carter chose a new National Commission on the Observance of International Women&#x27;s Year and appointed Abzug to head it. Numerous events were held over the next two years, culminating in the 1977 National Women&#x27;s Conference in November. She would continue this work as one of the two co-chairpersons for the National Advisory Committee for Women until her dismissal in January 1979, which would create a flash point of tension between the Carter administration and feminist organizations in the United States.

Abzug founded and ran several women&#x27;s advocacy organizations. She founded a grassroots organization called Women USA, and continued to lead feminist advocacy events, for example serving as grand marshal of the Women&#x27;s Equality Day New York March on August 26, 1980.

In the last decade of her life, in the early 1990s, with Kelber, she co-founded the Women&#x27;s Environment and Development Organization (WEDO), in their own words &quot;a global women&#x27;s advocacy organization working towards a just world that promotes and protects human rights, gender equality, and the integrity of the environment.&quot; In 1991, WEDO held the World Women&#x27;s Congress for a Healthy Planet in Miami, where 1,500 women from 83 countries produced the Women&#x27;s Action Agenda 21.

At the UN, Abzug developed the Women&#x27;s Caucus, which analyzed documents, proposed gender-sensitive policies and language, and lobbied to advance the Women&#x27;s Agenda for the 21st Century at the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, as well as women&#x27;s issues at other events including the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.

During her last years, Bella kept up her busy schedule of travel and work, even though she traveled in a wheelchair. Bella led WEDO until her death, giving her final public speech before the UN in March 1998.

After battling breast cancer for a number of years, she developed heart disease and died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center on March 31, 1998, from complications following open heart surgery. She was 77. Abzug was interred at Mount Carmel Cemetery, Glendale, Queens County, New York.

==Personal life==
In 1944, Bella married Martin Abzug, a novelist and stockbroker. They met on a bus in Miami, Florida while heading to a Yehudi Menuhin concert, and they remained married until his death in 1986. They had two daughters.

Abzug was a cousin of Arlene Stringer-Cuevas and her son Scott Stringer, who were also involved in politics in New York City.

Abzug used to comment that if male lawmakers were going to swim naked in the Congressional swimming pool as was the tradition, that that would be fine with her.

==Honors and legacy==
In 1974, Jeff London created a sculptural &quot;People Furniture&quot; of Abzug having a good idea. 
In 1991, Abzug received the &quot;Maggie&quot; Award, the highest honor of the Planned Parenthood Federation, in tribute to their founder, Margaret Sanger.

In 1994, Abzug was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls. The same year, she received a medal from the Veteran Feminists of America.

Abzug was honored on March 6, 1997, at the United Nations as a leading female environmentalist. She received the highest civilian recognition and honor at the U.N., the Blue Beret Peacekeepers Award.

In 2004, her daughter Liz Abzug, an adjunct Urban Studies Professor at Barnard College and a political consultant, founded the Bella Abzug Leadership Institute (BALI) to mentor and train high school and college women to become effective leaders in civic, political, corporate and community life. To commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the first National Women&#x27;s Conference held in Houston in 1977, over which Bella Abzug had presided, BALI hosted a National Women&#x27;s Conference on the weekend of November 10–11, 2007, at Hunter College (NYC). Over 600 people from around the world attended. Besides celebrating the 1977 Conference, the 2007 agenda was to address significant women&#x27;s issues for the 21st century.

In 2017, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Abzug one of its 50 Women Who Made American Political History.

In 2024, as part of Women&#x27;s History Month, NYC Mayor Eric Adams issued a proclamation for her work as a pioneering Congresswoman and feminist Leader, leading the fight for women&#x27;s and civil rights.

Various landmarks in New York City bear Abzug&#x27;s name. On March 1, 2019, the recently built Hudson Yards Park was renamed Bella Abzug Park as a tribute to women&#x27;s history month and its location in her former Congressional district. In New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village, a portion of Bank Street is named for Abzug.

== In popular culture ==
She appeared in the WLIW video &quot;A Laugh, A Tear, A Mitzvah&quot;, as well as in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Manhattan&quot; as herself, a 1977 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and the documentary &quot;New York: A Documentary Film&quot;.

In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Abzug&#x27;s name and picture.

Abzug appeared in Shirley MacLaine&#x27;s autobiographical book &quot;Out on a Limb&quot; (1983). In the 1987 ABC Television mini-series of the same name, Abzug was played by Anne Jackson.

In the 1989 Beastie Boys music video for “Hey Ladies” someone can be seen holding a sign saying “Vote For Bella Abzug”.

In 2019 Manhattan Theater Club, in New York City, produced &quot;Bella Bella,&quot; a one-character show written and performed by Harvey Fierstein. In the show, Fierstein portrayed Abzug and created dialogue &quot;from the words of Bella Abzug.&quot;

In the 2020 FX limited series, &quot;Mrs. America&quot;, Margo Martindale portrays Abzug. The program examines the unsuccessful multi-year battle to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. That same year, Bette Midler portrayed Abzug in the film &quot;The Glorias&quot;.

Abzug was featured in a segment in the 2007 documentary &quot;NY77: The Coolest Year in Hell&quot;, which explores in depth what life was like during the year 1977 in Manhattan. An excerpt from a press conference of Bella Abzug is used when discussing the differences in political views between Abzug and fellow mayoral candidate Ed Koch. Geraldo Rivera gave detailed commentary on Bella&#x27;s personality and political style.

Jeff L. Lieberman produced the 2023 documentary Bella! about Abzug&#x27;s life and political achievements. The film includes interviews with Barbra Streisand, Shirley MacLaine, Hillary Clinton, Lily Tomlin, Nancy Pelosi, Gloria Steinem, Maxine Waters, Phil Donahue, Marlo Thomas, Charles Rangel, David Dinkins, and Renée Taylor.

<text>HMS &quot;Imperial&quot; was one of nine s built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. She was scuttled by in 1941 after she had been crippled by Italian bombers.

==Description==
The I-class ships were improved versions of the preceding H-class. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and were intended to give a maximum speed of . &quot;Icarus&quot; reached a speed of from during her sea trials. The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . Their crew numbered 145 officers and ratings.

The ships mounted four 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The I class was fitted with two above-water quintuple torpedo tube mounts amidships for  torpedoes. One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 16 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. The I-class ships were fitted with the ASDIC sound detection system to locate submarines underwater.

==Construction and career==
The ship was ordered under the 1935 Build Programme from Hawthorn Leslie, Hebburn, on 30 October 1935 with a delivery date of 30 April 1937. The ship was laid down on 26 January 1936 and launched on 11 December the same year, and was the first RN warship to carry the name. &quot;Imperial&quot; was completed late, on 30 June 1937, after a delay in the delivery of the gun mountings. The contract price was £257,117 excluding items supplied by Admiralty such as guns and communication equipment.

&quot;Imperial&quot; took part in the Norwegian Campaign and in August 1940 was redeployed to escort convoys to Malta. On 28 May 1941, Italian bombers from &quot;41 Gruppo&quot; attacked &quot;Imperial&quot; and inflicted severe damage. Once it was ascertained that the vessel was damaged beyond repair, she was scuttled east of Kassos.

<text>In mathematics, specifically real analysis and functional analysis, the Kirszbraun theorem states that if is a subset of some Hilbert space , and is another Hilbert space, and 

:formula_1

is a Lipschitz-continuous map, then there is a Lipschitz-continuous map 

:formula_2

that extends and has the same Lipschitz constant as .

Note that this result in particular applies to Euclidean spaces and , and it was in this form that Kirszbraun originally formulated and proved the theorem. The version for Hilbert spaces can for example be found in (Schwartz 1969, p. 21). If is a separable space (in particular, if it is a Euclidean space) the result is true in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory; for the fully general case, it appears to need some form of the axiom of choice; the Boolean prime ideal theorem is known to be sufficient.

The proof of the theorem uses geometric features of Hilbert spaces; the corresponding statement for Banach spaces is not true in general, not even for finite-dimensional Banach spaces. It is for instance possible to construct counterexamples where the domain is a subset of formula_3 with the maximum norm and formula_4 carries the Euclidean norm. More generally, the theorem fails for formula_5 equipped with any formula_6 norm (formula_7) (Schwartz 1969, p. 20).

== Explicit formulas ==
For an formula_8-valued function the extension is provided by formula_9 where formula_10 is the Lipschitz constant of formula_11 on . 

In general, an extension can also be written for formula_12-valued functions as formula_13 where formula_14 and conv(&quot;g&quot;) is the lower convex envelope of &quot;g&quot;.

==History==

The theorem was proved by Mojżesz David Kirszbraun, and later it was reproved by Frederick Valentine, who first proved it for the Euclidean plane. Sometimes this theorem is also called Kirszbraun–Valentine theorem.

<text>HMS &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; was an built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides as part of the Mediterranean Fleet. Before the start of World War II, the ship was modified so that she could be used to lay mines by removing some of her armament. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; was transferred to Western Approaches Command shortly after the war began and helped to sink one German submarine in October 1939. She was converted to a minelayer while undergoing a refit in November–December and laid minefields in German coastal waters as well as anti-submarine minefields off the British coast until she was reconverted back to her destroyer configuration in February 1940. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; reverted to her minelaying role during the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940 and then laid a number of minefields off the Dutch coast during the Battle of the Netherlands in May. The ship participated in the Dunkirk evacuation until she was badly damaged by German aircraft on 1 June. On her first minelaying mission after her repairs were completed, she struck a German mine and had to be scuttled on 1 September 1940 during the Texel Disaster.

==Description==
The I-class ships were improved versions of the preceding H-class. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and were intended to give a maximum speed of . &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; only reached a speed of from during her sea trials. The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . Their crew numbered 145 officers and ratings.

The ships mounted four 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The I class was fitted with two above-water quintuple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 16 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; was one of the four I-class destroyers fitted with minelaying equipment in late 1938 – January 1939 at Malta. This consisted of mounts for rails on the deck on which to carry the mines and an electric winch to move the mines down the rails. A pair of sponsons were added to the stern to allow the mines to clear the propellers when dropped into the sea. &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; guns and both sets of torpedo tubes were modified to allow them to be removed to compensate for the weight of the mines. The ships could carry a maximum of 72 mines. The I-class ships were fitted with the ASDIC sound detection system to locate submarines underwater.

==Construction and career==
The ship was ordered from Yarrow Shipbuilders at Scotstoun on 30 October 1935 under the 1935 Naval Programme. The ship was laid down on 12 February 1936 and launched on 11 February 1937 as the second Royal Navy warship to carry the name. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; was completed on 24 August 1937 and cost £259,371 excluding items supplied by the Admiralty such as guns and communications equipment. She was assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning and participated in training exercises with the French Navy from December to January 1938. The ship was forced to leave these exercises prematurely as she had problems with the tubes in her superheaters, that were replaced at Malta from 15 January – 19 March. Afterwards, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; was transferred to Gibraltar where she patrolled Spanish waters enforcing the policies of the Non-Intervention Committee until the end of the war. She was in Cartagena from February to March 1939 to protect British citizens and interests as foreigners, Republican troops and their supporters evacuated the city.

&quot;Ivanhoe&quot; was in transit between Alexandria and Malta when the Second World War began in September 1939 but she was in Plymouth on 14 September as the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla had been transferred to the Western Approaches Command for escort duties. Together with her sisters, , , and , the ship sank the on 14 October. She was refitted at Sheerness Dockyard and converted to a minelayer from 14 November to 13 December. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; was transferred to the specialist minelaying 20th Destroyer Flotilla on 12 December and laid her first minefield, along with the other three ships of the flotilla, at the mouth of the Ems estuary on the night of 17/18 December. Another minefield was laid on the night of 2/3 January 1940 by &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; and &quot;Intrepid&quot; and they then laid a series of anti-submarine minefields later in the month. The ship replaced her guns and torpedo tubes at Portland from 27 January to 3 February and resumed her former duties.

In early April, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; and three other destroyer minelayers were escorted by the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla as they laid mines as part of Operation Wilfred, an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the shipment of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany. The mines were laid on the early morning of 8 April, before the Germans began their invasion, and the destroyers joined the battlecruiser and her escorts after they each laid their 60 mines. The ship was present during, but played no significant part in, &quot;Renown&quot;″s brief Action off Lofoten with the German battleships and on 9 April. Later in the month, the ship carried troops of the 15th Infantry Brigade to Åndalsnes. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; then loaded mines and laid a minefield in the approaches to Trondheim, together with &quot;Icarus&quot; and , on the night of 29/30 April.

After a boiler cleaning (7–15 May) &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, , and , laid 164 mines off the Hook of Holland on the night of 15/16 May. Three German minesweepers were sunk by this minefield on 26 July. Three nights later, the same three ships, reinforced by &quot;Intrepid&quot;, &quot;Impulsive&quot;, and the auxiliary minelayer laid a minefield off the Dutch coast. &quot;Princess Victoria&quot; struck a German mine on the voyage home and was sunk; the destroyers rescued the ship&#x27;s survivors. They laid five more minefields off the Dutch coast before the end of the month. On 29 May, the ship was transferred to the Dunkirk evacuation effort and ferried 930 troops to Dover that day. She also took aboard the crew of the badly damaged destroyer and then scuttled &quot;Grafton&quot;. She was withdrawn from the evacuation on 30 May as too valuable to risk, but this decision was reversed the following day and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; evacuated 1,290 men to Dover. On the morning of 1 June, already having loaded troops, the ship was attacked off Dunkirk harbour by German aircraft. Two bombs missed to port and starboard, but the third detonated above the upper deck and flooded the two forward boiler rooms. The bomb killed 26, including five soldiers, and wounded many others. Most of the troops and wounded were taken off by the minesweeper and the destroyer . No. 3 boiler room was still operable and the ship reached Dover under her own power.

Repairs at Sheerness lasted until 28 August and she was converted back into a minelayer at Immingham from 28 to 31 August as she was transferred back to the 20th Destroyer Flotilla. That night, she sailed with &quot;Intrepid&quot;, &quot;Icarus&quot;, &quot;Esk&quot; and &quot;Express&quot; to lay a minefield off the Dutch coast, north of Texel. &quot;Express&quot; hit a mine in a new German field that night and had her bow blown off. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; closed to assist her and struck another mine shortly afterwards. The explosion knocked out her power for several hours, but the ship was able to raise steam by 01:45 on 1 September. She reached a speed of while steaming backwards to lessen the stress on her damaged bow. However, about 04:00, either her propellers fell off or her propeller shafts fractured, and she lost all speed. Around 08:00, four motor torpedo boats arrived; three of these loaded all but 37 men of the ship&#x27;s crew while the fourth stayed with the destroyer to recover the remaining crewmen. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; continued to take on water and started to list. Early in the afternoon, she lost all power to her pumps and the captain ordered the ship abandoned after opening her valves to speed her sinking. Shortly afterwards, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; was discovered and damaged by a German aircraft, but still did not sink. She had to be scuttled by a torpedo fired by the destroyer later in the afternoon. The ship quickly sank afterwards at position .

<doc id="472939" wikidata="Q3480437" url="?curid=472939" title="United States Foreign Service">
<text>The United States Foreign Service is the primary personnel system used by the diplomatic service of the United States federal government, under the aegis of the United States Department of State. It consists of over 13,000 professionals carrying out the foreign policy of the United States and aiding U.S. citizens abroad. Its current acting director general is Catherine Rodriguez.

Created in 1924 by the Rogers Act, the Foreign Service combined all consular and diplomatic services of the U.S. government into one administrative unit. In addition to the unit&#x27;s function, the Rogers Act defined a personnel system under which the United States secretary of state is authorized to assign diplomats abroad.

Members of the Foreign Service are selected through a series of written and oral examinations. They serve at any of the United States diplomatic missions around the world, including embassies, consulates, and other facilities. Members of the Foreign Service also staff the headquarters of the four foreign affairs agencies: the Department of State, headquartered at the Harry S Truman Building in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C.; the Department of Agriculture; the Department of Commerce; and the United States Agency for International Development.

The Foreign Service is managed by a director general who is appointed by the president of the United States, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The director general is traditionally a current or former Foreign Service officer (FSO). Congress created the position of director general through the Foreign Service Act of 1946.

Between 1946 and 1980, the director general was designated by the secretary of state. The first director general, Selden Chapin, held the position for less than six months before being replaced by Christian M. Ravndal, who held the position until June 1949. Both men were career FSOs.

Beginning on November 23, 1975, under a departmental administrative action, the director general has concurrently held the title of director of the Bureau of Global Talent Management. As the head of the bureau, the director general held a rank equivalent to an assistant secretary of state. Three of the last four directors general have been women.

==Historical background==
On September 15, 1789, the 1st United States Congress passed an act creating the Department of State and appointing duties to it, including the keeping of the Great Seal of the United States. Initially there were two services devoted to diplomatic and consular activity. The Diplomatic Service provided ambassadors and ministers to staff embassies overseas, while the Consular Service provided consuls to assist United States sailors and promote international trade and commerce.

Throughout the nineteenth century, ambassadors, or ministers, as they were known prior to the 1890s, and consuls were appointed by the president, and until 1856, earned no salary. Many had commercial ties to the countries in which they would serve, and were expected to earn a living through private business or by collecting fees. This was an arrangement challenged in the first professional survey of the service, David Baillie Warden&#x27;s pioneering work &quot;On the Origin, Nature, Progress and Influence of Consular Establishments&quot; (1813). As acting consul in Paris, Warden had found himself being treated by American merchants as no more than a hireling agent.

In 1856, Congress provided a salary for consuls serving at certain posts; those who received a salary could not engage in private business, but could continue to collect fees for services performed.

===Lucile Atcherson Curtis===
Lucile Atcherson Curtis was the first woman in what became the U.S. Foreign Service. Specifically, she was the first woman appointed as a United States Diplomatic Officer or Consular Officer, in 1923 (the U.S. did not establish the unified Foreign Service until 1924, at which time diplomatic and consular Officers became Foreign Service officers).

==Rogers Act==
The Rogers Act of 1924 merged the diplomatic and consular services of the government into the Foreign Service. An extremely difficult Foreign Service examination was also implemented to recruit the most outstanding Americans, along with a merit-based system of promotions. The Rogers Act also created the Board of the Foreign Service and the Board of Examiners of the Foreign Service, the former to advise the secretary of state on managing the Foreign Service, and the latter to manage the examination process.

In 1927, Congress passed legislation affording diplomatic status to representatives abroad of the Department of Commerce (until then known as &quot;trade commissioners&quot;), creating the Foreign Commerce Service. In 1930 Congress passed similar legislation for the Department of Agriculture, creating the Foreign Agricultural Service. Though formally accorded diplomatic status, however, commercial and agricultural attachés were civil servants (not officers of the Foreign Service). In addition, the agricultural legislation stipulated that agricultural attachés would not be construed as public ministers. On July 1, 1939, however, both the commercial and agricultural attachés were transferred to the Department of State under Reorganization Plan No. II. The agricultural attachés remained in the Department of State until 1954, when they were returned by Act of Congress to the Department of Agriculture. Commercial attachés remained with State until 1980, when Reorganization Plan Number 3 of 1979 was implemented under terms of the Foreign Service Act of 1980.

==Foreign Service Act of 1946==
In 1946 Congress at the request of the Department of State passed a new Foreign Service Act creating six classes of employees: chiefs of mission, Foreign Service officers, Foreign Service reservists, Foreign Service staff, &quot;alien personnel&quot; (subsequently renamed Foreign Service nationals and later locally employed staff), and consular agents. Officers were expected to spend the bulk of their careers abroad and were commissioned officers of the United States, available for worldwide service. Reserve officers often spent the bulk of their careers in Washington but were available for overseas service. Foreign Service staff personnel included clerical and support positions. The intent of this system was to remove the distinction between Foreign Service and civil service staff, which had been a source of friction. The Foreign Service Act of 1946 also repealed as redundant the 1927 and 1930 laws granting USDA and Commerce representatives abroad diplomatic status, since at that point agricultural and commercial attachés were appointed by the Department of State.

The 1946 Act replaced the Board of Foreign Service Personnel, a body concerned solely with administering the system of promotions, with the Board of the Foreign Service, which was responsible more broadly for the personnel system as a whole, and created the position of director general of the Foreign Service. It also introduced the &quot;up-or-out&quot; system under which failure to gain promotion to higher rank within a specified time in class would lead to mandatory retirement, essentially borrowing the concept from the U.S. Navy. The 1946 Act also created the rank of Career Minister, accorded to the most senior officers of the service, and established mandatory retirement ages.

==Foreign Service Act of 1980==
The new personnel management approach was not wholly successful, which led to an effort in the late 1970s to overhaul the 1946 act. During drafting of this act, Congress chose to move the commercial attachés back to Commerce while preserving their status as Foreign Service officers, and to include agricultural attachés of the Department of Agriculture in addition to the existing FSOs of the Department of State, U.S. Information Agency, and U.S. Agency for International Development.

The Foreign Service Act of 1980 is the most recent major legislative reform to the Foreign Service. It abolished the Foreign Service reserve category of officers, and reformed the personnel system for non-diplomatic locally employed staff of overseas missions (Foreign Service Nationals). It created a Senior Foreign Service with a rank structure equivalent to general and flag officers of the armed forces and to the Senior Executive Service. It enacted danger pay for those diplomats who serve in dangerous and hostile surroundings along with other administrative changes. The 1980 Act also reauthorized the Board of the Foreign Service, which &quot;shall include one or more representatives of the Department of State, the United States Information Agency, the United States Agency for International Development, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Labor, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Management and Budget, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and such other agencies as the President may designate.&quot;

This board is charged with advising &quot;the Secretary of State on matters relating to the Service, including furtherance of the objectives of maximum compatibility among agencies authorized by law to utilize the Foreign Service personnel system and compatibility between the Foreign Service personnel system and the other personnel systems of the Government.&quot;

==Members of the Foreign Service==

The Foreign Service Act, &quot;et seq.&quot;, defines the following members of the Foreign Service:
*Chiefs of mission are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.
*Ambassadors at large are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.
*Senior Foreign Service (SFS) members are the senior leaders and experts for the management of the Foreign Service and the performance of its functions. They are appointed by the president, with the advice and consent of the Senate. SFS may come from the FSO or specialist ranks and are the equivalent to flag or general officers in the military.
*Foreign Service officers (known informally as &quot;generalists&quot;) are appointed by the president, with the advice and consent of the Senate. These are mostly diplomat &quot;generalists&quot; who, along with some subject area experts, have primary responsibility for carrying out the functions of the Foreign Service.
*Foreign Service specialists provide special skills and services required for effective performance by the service (including, but not limited to facilities managers, IT specialists, nurse practitioners, office managers, and special agents in the Diplomatic Security Service). They are appointed by the secretary of state.
*Foreign Service nationals (FSNs) are personnel who provide clerical, administrative, technical, fiscal, and other support at posts abroad. They may be native citizens of the host country or third-country citizens (the latter referred to in the past as third-country nationals or TCNs). They are &quot;members of the Service&quot; as defined in the Foreign Service Act unlike other locally employed staff, (also known as LE staff) who in some cases are U.S. citizens living abroad.
*Consular agents provide consular and related services as authorized by the secretary of state at specified locations abroad where no Foreign Service posts are situated.

Additionally, diplomats in residence are senior Foreign Service officers who act as recruiters for the United States Foreign Service. They operate in designated regions and hold honorary positions in local universities.

==Foreign affairs agencies==
While employees of the Department of State make up the largest portion of the Foreign Service, the Foreign Service Act of 1980 authorizes other U.S. government agencies to use the personnel system for positions that require service abroad. These include the Department of Commerce (Foreign Commercial Service), the Department of Agriculture (specifically the Foreign Agricultural Service, though the secretary of agriculture has also authorized the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to use the system as well), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). USAID, Commerce, and Agriculture senior career FSOs can be appointed to ambassadorships, although the ranks of career ambassadors are in the vast majority of cases drawn from the Department of State, with a far smaller sub-set drawn from the ranks of USAID mission directors.

==Foreign Service size==
The total number of Foreign Service members, excluding Foreign Service nationals, from all Foreign Service agencies (State, USAID, etc.) is about 15,600. This includes:
*7,999 Foreign Service officers, called &quot;generalist&quot; diplomats
*5,791 Foreign Service specialists (consular fellows are counted by State Human Resources as specialists)
*1,700 (with plans to hire 150 more) USAID FSOs
*229 Foreign Commercial Service officers
*150 to 165 Foreign Agricultural Service officers
*40 APHIS FSOs
*20 to 25 U.S. Agency for Global Media FSOs

==Employment==
The process of being employed in the Foreign Service is different for each of the five categories as defined in the Foreign Service Act.

The evaluation process for all Department of State Foreign Service officers and specialists can be broadly summarized as: Initial application, Qualifications Evaluation Panel (QEP), oral assessment/Foreign Service Officer Assessment, clearances and final suitability review, and the register.

All evaluation steps for generalist and specialist candidates are anchored using 11 personality characteristics, known as dimensions. Familiarity with these characteristics dramatically improves a candidate&#x27;s probability of success.

=== Initial application ===

Step 1 for a generalist is the Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT). For a specialist, it is an application on USAJobs.

==== FSOT ====

Before taking the FSOT, applicants must submit six personal narratives. The FSOT itself is a written exam consisting of four sections: job knowledge, English expression, situational judgement, and a written essay. 

==== USAJobs ====

Specialists fill out applications tailored to their particular knowledge areas. Given how varied the specialties are, applications vary. Candidates are asked to rate their own levels of experience, citing examples and references who can verify these claims.

=== QEP ===

The applicant&#x27;s entire package (including their personal narratives) is then reviewed by the Qualifications Evaluation Panel (QEP). In July 2022, the State Department eliminated the minimum passing score for the FSOT; the QEP now uses a holistic approach to candidate evaluation, scoring &quot;each candidate based on educational and work background, responses to personal narrative questions, and the FSOT score.&quot; The most qualified candidates are invited to participate in the Foreign Service Officer Assessment (FSOA). Formerly known as the oral exam and administered in person in Washington, D.C. and other major cities throughout the United States, the FSOA is now conducted entirely online.

Specialists also undergo a QEP, but their essays are collected as part of the initial application on USAJobs. Foreign Service specialist (FSS) candidates are evaluated by subject matter experts for proven skills and recommended to the Board of Examiners for an oral assessment based on those skills.

=== FSOA and oral assessments ===

This stage of the assessment process also varies for generalists and specialists. For specialists, there is a structured oral interview, written assessment, and usually an online, objective exam. For generalists, the FSOA consists of a case-management exercise, group exercise, and structured interview, 

The various parts of the oral assessment/FSOA are scored on a seven-point scale; these individual scores are then aggregated. At the end of the day, a candidate will be informed if their score met the 5.25 cutoff score necessary to continue their candidacy. This score becomes relevant again after the final suitability review. Successfully passing the oral assessment/FSOA earns a candidate a conditional offer of employment.

=== Clearances and final suitability review ===

Candidates must then obtain a Class 1 (worldwide available) medical clearance, top secret security clearance, and suitability clearance. Depending upon the candidate&#x27;s specific career track, they may also require eligibility for a top secret sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI) clearance. Once a candidate&#x27;s clearance information has been obtained, a final suitability review decides if this candidate is appropriate for employment in the Foreign Service. If so, the candidate&#x27;s name is moved to the register.

Failure to obtain any of these clearances can result in a candidate&#x27;s eligibility being terminated. It can be difficult for a candidate to receive a top-secret clearance if they have extensive foreign travel, dual citizenship, non-United States citizen family members, foreign spouses, drug use, financial problems or a poor record of financial practices, frequent gambling, and allegiance or de facto allegiance to a foreign state. Additionally, it can be difficult for anyone who has had a significant health problem to receive a Class 1 medical clearance.

The Foreign Service rejected all candidates with HIV until 2008 when it decided to consider candidates on a case-by-case basis. The State Department said it was responding to changes in HIV treatment, but the policy change came after a decision by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in &quot;Taylor v. Rice&quot; that suggested the ban on HIV-positive applicants would not survive a lawsuit challenging it.

=== Register ===

Once an applicant passes the security and medical clearances, as well as the Final Review Panel, they are placed on the register of eligible hires, ranked according to the score that they received in the oral assessment/FSOA. There are factors that can increase a candidate&#x27;s score, such as foreign language proficiency or veteran&#x27;s preference. Once a candidate is put on the register, they can remain for 18 months. If they are not hired from the register within 18 months, their candidacy is terminated. Separate registers are maintained for each of the five generalist career cones as well as the 23 specialist career tracks.

Technically, there are many registers (one for each Foreign Service specialty and then one for each generalist cone). The rank-order competitiveness of the register is only relevant within each candidate&#x27;s career field. Successful candidates from the register will receive offers of employment to join a Foreign Service class. Generalists and specialists attend separate orientation classes.

Generalist candidates who receive official offers of employment must attend a six-week training/orientation course known as A-100 at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) in Arlington, Virginia. Specialist orientation at FSI is three weeks long. Depending upon the specialty, employees will then undergo several months of training before departing for their first assignment.

==Service terms and conditions==
Members of the Foreign Service are expected to serve much of their career abroad, working at embassies and consulates around the world. By internal regulation, the maximum stretch of domestic assignments should last no more than six years (extensions are possible at the six-year limit for medical reasons, to enable children to complete high school, etc.; the eight year limit is difficult to pierce and is reserved for those who are deemed &quot;critical to the service&quot; and for those persons at the deputy assistant secretary level). By law, however, Foreign Service personnel must go abroad after ten years of domestic service. The difficulties and the benefits associated with working abroad are many, especially in relation to family life.

Dependent family members generally accompany Foreign Service employees overseas. This has become more difficult in regions marked by conflict and upheaval (currently many posts in the Middle East) where assignments are unaccompanied. The children of Foreign Service members, sometimes called Foreign Service brats, grow up in a unique world, one that separates them, willingly or unwillingly, from their counterparts living continuously in the United States of America.

While many children of Foreign Service members become very well developed, are able to form friendships easily, are skilled at moving frequently, and enjoy international travel, other children have extreme difficulty adapting to the Foreign Service lifestyle. For both employees and their families, the opportunity to see the world, experience foreign cultures firsthand for a prolonged period, and the camaraderie amongst the Foreign Service and expatriate communities in general are considered some of the benefits of Foreign Service life.

Some of the downsides of Foreign Service work include exposure to tropical diseases and the assignment to countries with inadequate health care systems, and potential exposure to violence, civil unrest and warfare. Attacks on US embassies and consulates around the world—Beirut, Islamabad, Belgrade, Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Baghdad, Kabul, and Benghazi, among others—underscore the dangers faced.

Foreign Service personnel stationed in nations with inadequate public infrastructure also face greater risk of injury or death due to fire, traffic accidents, and natural disasters. For instance, an FSO was one of the first identified victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

For members of the Foreign Service, maintaining a personal life outside of work can be exceptionally difficult. In addition to espionage, there is also the danger of personnel using their position illegally for financial gain. The most frequent kind of illegal abuse of an official position concerns consular officers. There have been a handful of cases of FSOs on consular assignments selling visas for a price.

Members of the Foreign Service must agree to worldwide availability, that is, they must be willing to be deployed anywhere in the world based on the needs of the service. In practice, they generally have significant input as to where they will work, although issues such as rank, language ability, and previous assignments will affect one&#x27;s possible onward assignments. All assignments are based on the needs of the service, and historically it has occasionally been necessary for the department to make directed assignments to a particular post in order to fulfill the government&#x27;s diplomatic requirements. This is not the norm, however, as many Foreign Service employees have volunteered to serve even at extreme hardship posts, including, most recently, Iraq and Afghanistan. FSOs must also agree to publicly support the policies of the United States government. 

The State Department maintains a Family Liaison Office to assist diplomats, including members of the Foreign Service and their families, in dealing with the unique issues of life as a U.S. diplomat, including the extended family separations that are usually required when an employee is sent to a danger post.

== Issues ==

=== Clientitis ===
Clientitis (also called clientism or localitis) is the tendency of the resident in-country staff of an organization to regard the officials and people of the host country as &quot;clients.&quot; This condition can be found in business or government. 

A hypothetical example of clientitis would be a Foreign Service officer (FSO), serving overseas at a U.S. embassy, who drifts into a mode of routinely and automatically defending the actions of the host country government. In such an example, the officer has come to view the officials and government workers of the host country government as the persons he is serving. Former USUN ambassador and White House national security advisor John Bolton has used this term repeatedly to describe the mindset within the culture of the US State Department.

The State Department&#x27;s training for newly appointed ambassadors warns of the danger of clientitis, and the department rotates FSOs every two to three years to avoid it. During the Nixon administration, the State Department&#x27;s Global Outlook Program (GLOP) attempted to combat clientitis by transferring FSOs to regions outside their area of specialization.

Robert D. Kaplan writes that the problem &quot;became particularly prevalent&quot; among American diplomats in the Middle East because the investment of time needed to learn Arabic and the large number of diplomatic postings where it was spoken meant diplomats could spend their entire career in a single region.

==Foreign Service career system==
The Foreign Service personnel system is part of the excepted service and both generalist and specialist positions are competitively promoted through comparison of performance in annual sessions of selection boards. Each foreign affairs agency establishes time-in-class (TIC) and time-in-service (TIS) rules for certain categories of personnel in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Service Act. This may include a maximum of 27 years of commissioned service if a member is not promoted into the Senior Foreign Service, and a maximum of 15 years of service in any single grade prior to promotion into the Senior Foreign Service. Furthermore, Selection Boards may recommend members not only for promotions, but for selection out of the service due to failure to perform at the standard set by those members&#x27; peers in the same grade. The TIC rules do not apply to office management specialists, medical specialists, and several other categories but most members of the Foreign Service are subject to an &quot;up or out&quot; system similar to that of military officers.

This system stimulates members to perform well, and to accept difficult and hazardous assignments.

<doc id="472943" wikidata="Q2739335" url="?curid=472943" title="Fairmount Park">
<text>Fairmount Park is the largest municipal park in Philadelphia and the historic name for a group of parks located throughout the city. Fairmount Park consists of two park sections named East Park and West Park, divided by the Schuylkill River, with the two sections together totalling . Management of Fairmount Park and the entire citywide park system is overseen by Philadelphia Parks &amp; Recreation, a city department created in 2010 from the merger of the Fairmount Park Commission and the Department of Recreation.

Many of the city&#x27;s other parks had historically also been included in the Fairmount Park system prior to 2010, including Wissahickon Valley Park in Northwest Philadelphia, Pennypack Park in Northeast Philadelphia, Cobbs Creek Park in West Philadelphia, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park in South Philadelphia, and 58 additional parks, parkways, plazas, squares, and public golf courses spread throughout the city. Since the 2010 merger, however, the term &quot;Fairmount Park system&quot; is no longer used by the Parks &amp; Recreation department, and the adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park and all other park areas are considered completely separate entities.

==History==

Fairmount Park, Philadelphia&#x27;s first park, occupies adjacent to the banks of the Schuylkill River. Since 2010, Philadelphia Parks &amp; Recreation divides the original park into East and West Fairmount parks. The original domain of Fairmount Park consisted of three areas: South Park or the South Garden immediately below the Fairmount Water Works extending to the Callowhill Street Bridge; Old Park, which encompassed the former estates of Lemon Hill and Sedgeley; and West Park, the area including the Philadelphia Zoo, and the Centennial Exposition grounds. The South Garden predated the establishment of the Park Commission in 1867, while Lemon Hill and Sedgeley were added in 1855–56. After the American Civil War, work progressed on acquiring and laying out West Park. In the 1870s, the Fairmount Park Commission expropriated properties along the Wissahickon Creek to extend Fairmount Park. The Schuylkill River Trail is a modern paved multi-use trail by Kelly Drive in the East Park.

The Belmont Plateau Cross Country Course is located in Fairmount Park. The 1923 and 1976 USA Cross Country Championships were held in the park.

===Growth===

The park grew out of the Lemon Hill estate of Henry Pratt, whose land was originally owned by Robert Morris, signer of the Declaration of Independence. Purchased by the city in 1844, the estate was dedicated to the public by city council&#x27;s ordinance on September 15, 1855. A series of state and local legislative acts over the next three years increased the holdings of the city. In 1858, the city held a design competition to re-landscape Lemon Hill and Sedgeley for public use as the best way to better protect the city&#x27;s water supply.(Ironically the land the Sedgeley mansion was built on had originally been owned by Robert Morris although after his bankruptcy it had been sold to a different purchaser then Henry Pratt).

The park was the site of the 1876 Centennial Exposition and the first zoo in the United States, the Philadelphia Zoo, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Wissahickon Valley Park, located adjacent to the park&#x27;s immediate northwest, was included in the Fairmount Park NRHP registration document.

==In popular culture==
The outdoor scenes of the 2000 period art-horror film &quot;A Chronicle of Corpses&quot; were shot in Carpenter&#x27;s Woods in the Wissahickon Valley Park part of Fairmount Park.

==Properties==
Park properties include the Centennial Arboretum, a Horticulture Center, Fairmount Water Works, Memorial Hall (home of the Please Touch Museum), Shofuso Japanese House and Garden, Boathouse Row, Smith Memorial Arch, Smith Memorial Playground and Playhouse, recreation centers, reservoirs, statues and other pieces of art.

===Public art===
Fairmount Park is home to a large collection of public art, largely attributable to efforts of the Association for Public Art, known previously as the Fairmount Park Art Association, a non-profit organization founded in 1872 to embellish Fairmount Park with outdoor sculpture, including the Medici lions known as the &quot;Florentine Lions&quot; installed in 1887. The Art Association continues to commission and care for a large number of sculptures, in coordination with the park and city. In 2007, the Art Association installed &quot;Iroquois&quot; by Mark di Suvero near the Philadelphia Museum of Art on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.

=== Historic houses===
Mount Pleasant, built in 1762–65 for a Scottish ship captain named John Macpherson, is administered by the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The Art Museum also administers Cedar Grove Mansion, a house built in 1748–50 in what later became the Frankford neighborhood of the city. Cedar Grove was relocated to the park in 1926–1928.

Other historic houses in the park, listed by year of construction, include Boelson Cottage (1678–84), The Lilacs (c. 1711), Letitia Street House (c. 1713), Ridgeland Mansion (1719), Belmont Mansion (1745), The Cliffs (1753; ruins since a fire in 1986), Woodford Mansion (1756), Hatfield House (1760), Randolph House (c. 1767; renamed &quot;Laurel Hill Mansion&quot; in 1976), Strawberry Mansion (c. 1783–89), The Solitude (1784–85; located within the zoo), Sweetbriar Mansion (1797), Ormiston Mansion (1798), Lemon Hill Mansion (1800), Chamounix Mansion (1802), Rockland Mansion (c. 1810), and the Ohio House which was built for the Centennial Exposition of 1876.

Sedgeley Mansion was built in 1799 on Lemon Hill, then abandoned and later demolished after being acquired through eminent domain by the city in 1857. The Sedgeley property also included a servant&#x27;s cottage constructed of stone which still exists. The cottage was designed by Benjamin Henry Latrobe and is presently known as the Sedgeley Porter&#x27;s House.

<text>HMS &quot;Impulsive&quot; was an built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. She saw service in World War II before being scrapped in 1946. She has been the only ship of the Navy to bear this name.

==Description==
The I-class ships were improved versions of the preceding H-class. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and were intended to give a maximum speed of . &quot;Impulsive&quot; only reached a speed of from during her sea trials. The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . Their crew numbered 145 officers and ratings.

The ships mounted four 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The I class was fitted with two above-water quintuple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 16 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. &quot;Impulsive&quot; was one of the four I-class destroyers fitted with minelaying equipment in late 1938 – January 1939 at Malta. This consisted of mounts for rails on the deck on which to carry the mines and an electric winch to move the mines down the rails. A pair of sponsons were added to the stern to allow the mines to clear the propellers when dropped into the sea. &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; guns and both sets of torpedo tubes were modified to allow them to be removed to compensate for the weight of the mines. The ships could carry a maximum of 72 mines. The I-class ships were fitted with the ASDIC sound detection system to locate submarines underwater.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Impulsive&quot; was laid down on 9 March 1936 by J. Samuel White and Company at their Cowes shipyard, launched on 1 March 1937 and completed on 29 January 1938. 28 and 29 May 1940 she made four trips to Dunkirk and rescued 2,919 troops. After that, she laid mines and escorted Arctic convoys. On 13 May 1941 she rescued 278 survivors from the armed merchant cruiser . &quot;Impulsive&quot; attacked and sank the in the Barents Sea north-east of Murmansk in Russia on 16 September 1942. The destroyer&#x27;s commander was William Scott Thomas, grandfather of actress Kristin Scott Thomas and the father of Admiral Sir Richard Thomas (a former Black Rod).

&quot;Impulsive&quot; was sold for scrap to W. H. Arnott, Young and Company, Limited on 22 January 1946 and broken up at Sunderland.

<doc id="472947" wikidata="Q6679177" url="?curid=472947" title="Lord Dingwall">
<text>Lord Dingwall is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1584 for Andrew Keith, and in 1609 for Sir Richard Preston, with remainder to his heirs whatsoever. In 1619 he was further honoured when he was made Baron Dunmore and Earl of Desmond in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to heirs male. On his death in 1628 the Irish titles became extinct while he was succeeded in the Scottish lordship by his daughter Elizabeth, the second Lady Dingwall. She was the wife of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde. Their eldest son Thomas Butler, Earl of Ossory, was summoned by writ to the English Parliament as Baron Butler, of Moore Park, in 1666. However, he predeceased his parents who were both succeeded by their grandson, the second Duke and third Lord Dingwall. He had already succeeded his father as second Baron Butler. However, the Duke was attainted in 1715 and his titles forfeited. In 1871, Francis Cowper, 7th Earl Cowper, managed to obtain a reversal of the attainder of the lordship of Dingwall and barony of Butler and became the fourth Lord Dingwall and third Baron Butler. He was the great-great-great-grandson of Henrietta d&#x27;Auverquerque, Countess of Grantham (wife of Henry de Nassau d&#x27;Auverquerque, 1st Earl of Grantham), second daughter of Thomas Butler, Earl of Ossory and 1st Baron Butler, whose second daughter Lady Henrietta de Nassau d&#x27;Auverquerque married William Clavering-Cowper, 2nd Earl Cowper. In 1880 he also succeeded his mother as eighth Baron Lucas of Crudwell. For later history of the lordship of Dingwall and barony of Butler, see the Baron Lucas of Crudwell.

<doc id="472948" wikidata="Q1948053" url="?curid=472948" title="History of the United States (1991–2016)">
<text>The history of the United States from 1991 to 2016 began following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The dissolution signaled the end of the Cold War and left the U.S. unchallenged as the world&#x27;s sole superpower. The U.S. took a leading role in military involvement in the Middle East. The U.S. expelled an Iraqi invasion force from Kuwait, a Middle Eastern ally of the U.S., in the Persian Gulf War. On the domestic front, the Democrats won a return to the White House with the election of Bill Clinton in 1992. In the 1994 midterm election, the Republicans won control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Strife between Clinton and the Republicans in Congress initially resulted in a federal government shutdown following a budget crisis, but later they worked together to pass welfare reform, the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program, and a balanced budget. Charges from the Lewinsky scandal led to the 1998 impeachment of Clinton by the House of Representatives but he was later acquitted by the Senate. The U.S. economy boomed in the enthusiasm for high-technology industries in the 1990s until the Nasdaq crashed as the dot-com bubble burst and the early 2000s recession marked the end of the sustained economic growth.

In 2000, Republican George W. Bush was elected president in one of the closest elections in U.S. history. Early in his term, his administration approved education reform and a large across-the-board tax cut aimed at stimulating the economy. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the U.S. embarked on the Global War on Terrorism, starting with the 2001 war in Afghanistan to depose the Taliban and eliminate Al-Qaeda. In 2003, the U.S. invaded Iraq, deposing Saddam Hussein and setting up the Republic of Iraq resulting in a prolonged conflict that would continue over the course of the decade. The Homeland Security Department was formed and the controversial Patriot Act was passed to bolster domestic efforts against terrorism. In 2006, criticism over the handling of the disastrous Hurricane Katrina (which struck the Gulf Coast region in 2005), political scandals, and the growing unpopularity of the Iraq War helped the Democrats gain control of Congress. Saddam Hussein was later tried, charged for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and executed by hanging. In 2007, President Bush ordered a troop surge in Iraq, which ultimately led to reduced casualties.

The collapse of the housing bubble in 2007 led to the Great Recession. The resulting economic downturn and general discontent led Barack Obama to win the presidential election in 2008, becoming the country&#x27;s first African-American president. Obama&#x27;s domestic agenda notably included economic stimulus packages and the Affordable Care Act. The year 2011 saw the formal end to the Iraq War as well as the killing of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The War on Terror continued with a shift in attention toward the Islamic State in the 2010s.

==Globalization and the new economy==
During Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency American political discourse focused mostly on domestic issues. While the early 1990s saw the US economy mired in recession, a recovery began starting in 1994 and began accelerating thanks to a boom created by technology. The Internet and related technologies made their first broad penetrations into the economy, prompting a Wall Street technology-driven bubble, which Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan described in 1996 as &quot;irrational exuberance&quot;. By 1998, the economy was booming and unemployment below 5%.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States was the world&#x27;s dominant military power and Japan, sometimes seen as the largest economic rival to the U.S., was caught in a period of stagnation. China was emerging as the U.S.&#x27;s foremost trading competitor in more and more areas, with China&#x27;s exports growing exceedingly during the 1990s and well into the 2000s. Localized conflicts such as those in Haiti and the Balkans prompted President Bill Clinton to send in U.S. troops as peacekeepers, reviving the Cold-War-era controversy about whether policing the rest of the world was a proper U.S. role. Islamic radicals overseas loudly threatened assaults against the U.S. for its ongoing military presence in the Middle East, and even staged the first World Trade Center attack, a truck bombing in New York&#x27;s twin towers, in 1993, as well as a number of deadly attacks on U.S. interests abroad.

Immigration, mainly from Latin America and Asia, swelled during the 1990s, laying the groundwork for great changes in the demographic makeup of the U.S. population in coming decades, such as Hispanics replacing African-Americans as the largest minority. Despite tougher border scrutiny after the September 11 attacks, nearly 8 million immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2005—more than in any other five-year period in the nation&#x27;s history—with almost half entering illegally.

The 1990s saw the US becoming more involved in free trade with the NAFTA agreement involving the US, Canada and Mexico being signed in 1992 before coming into effect in 1994 along with joining the World Trade Organization in 1995. During this period, inflation remained low despite recessions happening making it different from previous times in US history when inflation would increase when the economy grew. Deflation was only reported in one year which was 2009 with the inflation rate being -0.4%.

===Dot-com bubble===

Early 2000 to 2001 saw the dramatic bursting of the dot-com bubble. Excitement over the prospects of Internet stocks had led to huge increases in the major indexes. However, dozens of start-up Internet companies failed as many of the lofty promises heralded by the new world of the Web failed to materialize. On March 10, 2000, the Nasdaq peaked at 5,048.62, more than double its value just a year before. The downturn began on March 13, 2000, triggering a chain reaction of selling that fed on itself as investors, funds, and institutions liquidated positions. In just six days, the NASDAQ had lost nearly nine percent, falling to 4,580 on March 15. By 2001, the bubble was deflating at full speed. A majority of the dot-coms ceased trading after burning through their venture capital, many having never made a profit.

In 2002, the GDP growth rate rose to 2.8%. A major short-term problem in the first half of 2002 was a sharp decline in the stock market, fueled in part by the exposure of dubious accounting practices in some major corporations. Another was unemployment, which experienced the longest period of monthly increase since the Great Depression. The United States began to recover from the post-9/11 recession in 2003, but the robustness of the market (7% GDP growth), combined with the unemployment rate (above 6%), led some economists and politicians to refer to the situation as a &quot;jobless recovery&quot;. Despite this, economic growth continued apace through early 2008 and unemployment dropped below 5%.

==Conflicts==

===Persian Gulf War===
The considerable dependence of the industrialized world on oil starting in the 1930s, with much of the proved oil reserves situated in Middle Eastern countries, became evident to the U.S., first in the aftermath of the 1973 world oil shock and later in the second energy crisis of 1979. Although in real terms oil prices fell back to pre-1973 levels through the 1980s, resulting in a windfall for the oil-consuming nations (especially North America, Western Europe, and Japan), the vast reserves of the leading Middle East producers guaranteed the region its strategic importance. By the early 1990s the politics of oil still proved as hazardous as it did in the early 1970s.

Conflict in the Middle East triggered yet another international crisis on August 2, 1990, when Iraq invaded and attempted to annex neighboring Kuwait. U.S. officials feared that Hussein was then on the verge of armed conflict with oil-rich Saudi Arabia, a close ally of Washington&#x27;s since the 1940s. The United Nations condemned the invasion as an act of aggression; President Bush compared Hussein to Adolf Hitler and declared that if the United States and international community did not act, aggression would be encouraged elsewhere in the world. The Security Council gave Iraq a deadline to leave Kuwait, but Saddam Hussein ignored it, and the Security Council authorized a military response. The war began in January 1991, with U.S. troops forming the majority of the coalition which participated in Operation Desert Storm. By the time Iraqi troops withdrew from Kuwait in late February, Iraq had lost approximately 20,000 troops, with some sources citing as many as 100,000 casualties on the Iraqi side.

===Conflicts in Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and the Middle East===
In December 1992, President Bush sent troops to join the UN Operation Restore Hope, a multi-national effort to restore order and provide humanitarian aid in Somalia, which was torn by civil war, famine, and warlords. By the summer of 1993, the situation had deteriorated. After 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed in June 1993, the UN passed a resolution calling for the arrest and trial of those responsible for the attack. Under the leadership of newly elected President Bill Clinton, U.S. forces launched a concentrated attack on Aidid&#x27;s stronghold in Mogadishu in Operation Gothic Serpent. In October 1993, 18 soldiers were killed and 84 were wounded in the Battle of Mogadishu. Following the attack, Clinton ordered U.S. forces withdrawn from the region, with the last being withdrawn by 1995, and fired his Secretary of Defense Les Aspin who had not sent adequate forces.

In the mid-1990s, the United States was involved in the Bosnian War through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), most notably the 1995 bombing campaign, which finally led to the Dayton Peace Agreement which ended the war by the end of 1995. In early 1998, the region became volatile again as war erupted between the army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Liberation Army, a guerrilla group. A 1999 NATO bombing campaign struck Yugoslavia, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Yugoslavian soldiers and civilians. As a result, Yugoslavia withdrew from Kosovo and Kosovo became an independent state.

President Clinton also ordered cruise missile strikes on Iraq in 1996 and bombing attacks on Iraq in 1998, which were launched in response to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s violation of several UN resolutions, including repression of ethnic minorities (Kurds) and removing UN weapons inspectors. The 1998 campaign, in particular, was meant to de-stabilize the Iraqi government and degrade the power of Hussein. Clinton also signed the Iraq Liberation Act to appropriate funds to Iraqi opposition groups in the hopes of overthrowing Hussein&#x27;s regime and establishing democracy.

Throughout the 1990s, the United States also played an active role in peace efforts in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. President Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and Palestinian Prime Minister Yasser Arafat met and signed the Oslo Accords in 1993, which called for the gradual ceding of control of Palestinian areas to the Palestinians in exchange for peace. However, Rabin was assassinated in 1995 and by 2000, the Camp David Summit failed to yield a new agreement.

===Early Islamist terrorist attacks===
The 1990s also featured a series of increasingly violent attacks associated with Islamist terrorists, including al-Qaeda, a radical Islamist militant organization led by Osama bin Laden. On February 26, 1993, a truck bomb was detonated at the World Trade Center in New York City, killing six civilians and injuring 919 others, 88 firefighters, and 35 police officers. The attack was intended to destroy the foundation of the North Tower, knocking the tower into the South Tower, which would destroy both buildings and kill thousands of people. While this did not happen, the bomb caused considerable damage to the lower levels of the North Tower. In 1994, four men were convicted of carrying out the bombing and in 1997, two men were convicted for their roles, including the truck driver and the mastermind, Ramzi Yousef.

On June 25, 1996, members of Hezbollah Al-Hejaz bombed the Khobar Towers, a complex in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, where members of the United States Air Force were being housed, killing 19 American airmen and injuring over 300 other people.

On August 7, 1998, Al-Qaeda bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people, including 12 Americans. The U.S. launched cruise missile strikes on a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, yet this failed to destroy al-Qaeda&#x27;s vast network.

On October 12, 2000, al-Qaeda militants bombed the USS &quot;Cole&quot; off the coast of Yemen, killing 17 U.S. sailors and severely damaging the ship.

===Attacks of September 11, 2001===

On the morning of September 11, 2001, four airliners were hijacked by 19 members of the terrorist organization al-Qaeda. The first hijacked airliner, American Airlines Flight 11, struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 A.M. (EST) in New York City; with a second, United Airlines Flight 175, striking the South Tower less than twenty minutes later at 9:03 A.M. (EST), resulting in the collapse of both 110 story skyscrapers, and the destruction of the World Trade Center. The third hijacked plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was crashed into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense) in Arlington County, Virginia, demolishing a section of the outer southwest facing wall. After passengers discovered that their plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was going to be used as a missile, they attempted to regain control of the aircraft which had been redirected towards Washington, D.C. However, the hijackers crashed the plane close to a rural community near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. It is believed that the target of Flight 93 was either the White House or the Capitol. In total, the attacks killed 2,996 people—2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel, and the 19 terrorists. The 9/11 attack was the single deadliest international terrorist incident and the most devastating foreign attack on American soil since the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. It refocused American attention to a long war on terrorism, beginning with an attack on al-Qaeda and its Taliban supporters in Afghanistan.

===War in Afghanistan===
Following the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, authorizing the president &quot;all necessary and appropriate force against the nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.&quot; This act resulted in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, in President George W. Bush&#x27;s broader Global War on Terrorism. The objective of the 2001 invasion, known as Operation Enduring Freedom, was to remove the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban lead government from power in Afghanistan, and to capture top level al-Qaeda leaders, including its founder Osama bin Laden. The invasion, fought in conjunction with the U.S.&#x27;s NATO allies, began on October 7, 2001, quickly leading to the overthrow of the Taliban government and implementation of Hamid Karzai as Afghanistan&#x27;s interim president. In early 2002, after the Battle of Tora Bora and success with Operation Anaconda, the United States began focusing on military intervention in Iraq, shifting military and intelligence resources away from Afghanistan in War on Terror, with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stating in May 2003 that the &quot;major combat&quot; in the conflict was over. With the approval of the new Afghan Constitution by the Loya jirga and election of President Karzai in 2004, Afghanistan later held its first parliamentary elections in over 30 years in 2005.

With a total of 22,000 U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan by May 2006, the U.S. joined in the ISAF lead Operation Mountain Thrust. In the attempt to quell the Taliban insurgency in southern Afghanistan, more than 1,000 insurgents and 150 ISAF troops were killed in the two-month operation, being the bloodiest period since the start of the war in 2001. With ISAF assuming complete command of security forces in Afghanistan in October 2006, the U.S. saw mounting skepticism from European allies over the war at the 2006 Riga summit. U.S.-Afghan diplomatic relations began to flare after the August 2008 Azizabad airstrike in Herat Province, which killed 91 civilians, including 60 children and 15 women. The attack sparked protest over &quot;collateral damage&quot;; with a 40% increase in civilian deaths in 2008.

In September 2008, President Bush announced he would shift 4,500 US Armed Forces troops from Iraq to the conflict in Afghanistan. This was followed with recently elected President Barack Obama announcing in February 2009 that the United States would deploy an additional 17,000 troops to Afghanistan. The Obama administration also later announced a &quot;troop surge&quot; of an additional 30,000 US military forces to be deployed in the summer of 2010, and to begin withdrawals of the 100,000 total US troops in July 2011. With the surge in effect, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) launched Operation Moshtarak, an offensive determined to eliminate Taliban insurgents from Helmand Province. At 15,000 troops, it was the largest joint operation of the war.

After a 2010 profile on US Army general and ISAF Commander Stanley McChrystal was published in the magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, McChrystal was forced to resign from his position after making controversial remarks about Obama administration officials. President Obama then announced ISAF to be commanded by General David Petraeus.

On May 1, 2011, President Barack Obama announced that the US conducted an operation that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The announcement drew worldwide praise, with spontaneous celebrations at Ground Zero, Times Square, and outside of the White House. The raid on bin Laden&#x27;s compound in Abbottabad led to a rise in diplomatic tensions between the US and Pakistan. With civilian deaths from the United States&#x27; drone program in so-called &quot;signature strikes&quot;, the 2011 NATO attack in Pakistan, which led to the deaths of 24 Pakistani military officers, and the closure of NATO supply lines to neighboring Afghanistan, Pakistan–United States relations remain fractured as a result of the War on Terror.

In mid-2011 Obama announced the start of the withdrawal of the additional 33,000 troops deployed from the 2010 troop surge. By December 2011, the first round of 10,000 troops were withdrawn, with the second round of 23,000 troops later withdrawn in September 2012.

As of February 2014, a total of 2,307 US troops were killed and 19,656 injured due to the Afghanistan War. Estimates from the Costs of Wars Project based at Brown University&#x27;s Watson Institute for International Studies also suggest that between 16,725 and 19,013 Afghan civilians died as a result of the war.

The International Security Assistance Force ceased combat operations and was disbanded in December 2014, with a small number of troops remaining behind in an advisory role as part of ISAF&#x27;s successor organization, the Resolute Support Mission. Unable to eliminate the Taliban through military means, coalition forces (and separately, the Afghan government led by Ashraf Ghani) turned to diplomacy to end the conflict.

===Iraq War===

In his State of the Union address in January 2002, President George W. Bush called Iran, Iraq, and North Korea an &quot;axis of evil&quot;. The Bush administration later began making a public case for an invasion of Iraq, accusing them of violating the 1991 UN-imposed ceasefire, supporting terrorism and being in possession of weapons of mass destruction (later, the latter of these accusations were proved to be false, and the first two are considered very dubious by most historians).

Some important allies of the U.S., including India, Japan, Turkey, New Zealand, France, Germany, and Canada, did not believe that the evidence for the President&#x27;s accusations was well-founded enough to justify a full-scale invasion, especially as military personnel were still needed in Afghanistan. The UN Security Council did not approve of the invasion, and the U.S. therefore provided most of the forces in the invasion of Iraq. With the support of a coalition whose major partners included the United Kingdom, Australia, Poland, Spain, and Italy, Iraq was invaded on March 20, 2003.

After six weeks of combat between the coalition and the Iraqi army, the invading forces had secured control of many key regions; Hussein had fled his palace, his regime clearly over; on May 1, President Bush declared, under a sign reading &quot;mission accomplished&quot;, that major ground operations were at an end. Saddam Hussein&#x27;s sons Qusay and Uday were killed by U.S. forces; Saddam himself was captured in December 2003 and taken into custody. Nevertheless, fighting with the Iraqi insurgency continued and escalated through the 2004 U.S. national elections and beyond.

With casualties increasing and the cost of the invasion and reconstruction of Iraq estimated at over $200 billion, the war has lost about one-third of its supporters in the U.S. since the end of major operations was announced. Contemporary polls suggested that international displeasure with the United States was at an all-time high, with a majority of people in Europe believing that the country was too powerful and acted mainly in self-interest, and a vast majority in predominantly Muslim nations believing that the United States was arrogant, belligerent, or hateful to Islam.

As the situation in Iraq became increasingly difficult and deadly, policymakers began looking for new options. This led to the formation of the Iraq Study Group, a nonpartisan commission chaired by James Baker and Lee H. Hamilton. This produced a variety of proposals; some of the more notable ones were to seek decreased US presence in Iraq, increased engagement with neighboring countries, and greater attention to resolving other local conflicts, such as the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The recommendations were generally ignored, and instead, President Bush ordered a surge of troops to Iraq in 2007 and 2008. Violence in the country declined in 2008 and 2009, and the US combat role ended in August 2010. US forces were withdrawn in large numbers in 2009 and 2010, and the war was declared formally over in December 2011.

==Domestic terrorism==

The 1990s and 2000s (decade) became known for several incidents of domestic terrorism, usually perpetrated by those dissatisfied with actions of the federal government, big business, or other aspects of American society.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a mysterious man known in the media as the &quot;Unabomber&quot; sent mail bombs to figures in the academic and airline industries for various reasons. After a lull, he began another mail bombing campaign in earnest, beginning in 1993. Two people were killed in the mid-1990s and an exhaustive and expensive investigation by the FBI coupled with intense national media interest in the story resulted in the identification and arrest of the perpetrator Theodore Kaczynski, who was sentenced to life in prison.

On April 19, 1995, a truck bomb was detonated outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, killing 168 people and injuring over 600. The bombing became the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in the United States and led to sweeping reforms in United States federal building security. The attack&#x27;s perpetrator, Timothy McVeigh, was an anti-government extremist who used the Waco Siege and Ruby Ridge incidents as justification for his retaliation against the federal government. While McVeigh wanted to specifically target the federal agencies involved in the Waco siege, such as the ATF and DEA, the bombing killed many innocent civilians, including 19 children. McVeigh was executed in 2001 and his accomplice Terry Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.

In July 1996, in the midst of the 1996 Summer Olympics at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, Georgia, a homemade bomb was detonated, resulting in the deaths of 2 people and injuring over 100. This was followed by similar attacks at two abortion clinics and a lesbian nightclub. In 2003, suspect Eric Robert Rudolph was arrested and sentenced in 2005 to five life sentences for these attacks.

In 2001, only days after the September 11 attacks, letters laced with anthrax were sent to several individuals, including prominent news personalities and government officials. The letters killed 5 people and infected a further 17. This incident of bioterrorism was initially blamed on international terrorist organization al-Qaeda, but in 2008, was determined to stem from a Maryland scientist by the name of Bruce Edward Ivins, who committed suicide before he could be prosecuted.

==Societal trends==
=== Crime and violence ===
The crime epidemic that had begun during the late 1960s finally reached its climax in the early 1990s before starting a steady decline during the Clinton administration. Nevertheless, ongoing addiction (involving sales of marijuana and cocaine) continued to be a major factor in crime in the United States. The overall rate of major crimes fell during the period. In 2009, the FBI estimated 1,318,000 violent crimes occurred nationwide, 1,425,000 in 2000, down from the 1991 level of 1,912,000. Measured per capita, this was a 43% drop in violent crime rates. At the time, it was believed that crime had declined because of stricter judicial sentencing practices, the implementation of Three Strikes laws, improving law enforcement technology that made it easier to catch felons, and the end of the crack epidemic. But later statistical assessments ruled out most of these explanations, and tended to find that factors such as greater prosperity, lower alcohol consumption, generation-specific cultural effects, improved security technology, and decreases in leaded petrol had probably caused most of the decline, while public policy conversation began to regret the incarcerative policies of the preceding decades.

In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), a number of highly publicized assaults against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people occurred in the United States. The most well known of these was the murder of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming after two young men kidnapped, tortured, and murdered him in 1998. In 2009, Congress passed the Matthew Shepard Act, which extended the hate crime law to women, the disabled, and gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transsexuals.

A spate of school shootings rocked the country in the late 1990s and the 2000s, the most notable being the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, that left 15 people dead, including both perpetrators Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. The actions of Harris and Klebold would go on to influence many future mass killers. Others include the Westside Middle School shooting (1998), the Red Lake shootings (2005), the West Nickel Mines School shooting (2006), the Virginia Tech shooting (2007), and the Northern Illinois University shooting (2008). Those shootings led to increased debate over gun politics and media violence, as well as an increased focus on mental health, school safety, and anti-bullying.

The Capital Region was struck by the Beltway sniper attacks, a series of sniper attacks on civilians and federal workers by two gunmen over a month-long period in October 2002. The attackers killed 10 people and injured three. Two men were arrested and convicted.

During the 2000s, a series of high-profile child abduction cases occurred, including Danielle van Dam (2002), Samantha Runnion (2002), Elizabeth Smart (2002), Carlie Brucia (2004), and Jessica Lunsford (2005). These incidents led to a public outcry and demands for stricter laws against sex offenders, the most notable of which was Jessica&#x27;s Law.

In 1992, riots occurred in Los Angeles after four police officers were acquitted in the beating of black motorist Rodney King. The riots occurred primarily in South Central Los Angeles, a predominantly black and Hispanic area. Fifty-five people were killed and more than 2000 were injured. 3,600 fires were set, destroying over 1,000 buildings and widespread looting occurred, especially of businesses owned by Korean Americans. In all, nearly $1 billion in damage was caused.

In November 2009, US Army major Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 fellow soldiers and injured 30 in the Fort Hood shooting in Killeen, Texas. While the act was called terrorism by some due to Hasan&#x27;s Muslim heritage, the attack was ruled out by the FBI to have been perpetrated by a terrorist organization. On September 16, 2013, another mass murder on a US military base surpassed the incident when a former navy reservist fired a shotgun at the Washington Navy Yard Shooting, killing 12 civilian contractors and injured four more at the headquarters of the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) in Southeast Washington, D.C.

On January 8, 2011, U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords was the target of an assassination attempt, when a gunman went on a shooting spree, critically injuring Giffords, killing federal judge John Roll and five other people, and wounding 14 others.

On July 20, 2012, a man shot 70 people (up to that time, the highest number of victims of any mass shooting in American history) at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 and injuring 58 others.

On April 15, 2013, two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon in Boston, Massachusetts, killing three people and injuring over 280. Three days later, suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev led the Boston Police Department on a high speed chase, after killing one officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police and a seriously injured Dzhokhar was taken into custody in nearby Watertown the following day.

On December 2, 2015, in the 2015 San Bernardino attack, 14 people were killed and 22 were injured in a mass shooting at a workplace Christmas party at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California. Both a workplace shooting and a terrorist attack, the incident was perpetrated by Rizwan Farook, a healthcare worker who was employed at the facility, and his wife Tashfeen Malik. The pair were US citizens of Pakistani descent who had become radicalized and had expressed a commitment to jihadism prior to the attack. The attack also included an attempted bombing. Four hours after the attack, the perpetrators were killed by police in a shootout that left two officers injured.

=== Technology ===
From the early 1990s to the mid 2010s vast technology changes would be seen in the United States such as: the number of wireless phones surpassing the number of landline phones, Internet usage becoming common among the population along with a large expansion in the number of actual internet users. 

The usage of landline phones would decline while that of wireless phones would increase. The percentage of American adults having wireless instead of landline would be surpassed in December 2008 and the percent of homes being solely wireless would surpass those having both wireless and landline in June 2015.

==== Internet usage ====
According to Our World in Data the usage of the internet grew during this time period going from 2.98 million internet users in 1991 to 281.59 million by 2016. 2008 would mark the first time that the country with the most internet users (the number of people who use the internet) was not the United States as China surpassed the country that year. Dial up internet was initially the most common way to connect to the internet but was later surpassed by broadband internet.

Internet based services that had their debuts were such as: Uber (originally known as UberCab until rebranding in October 2010) in June 2010 which initially operated in San Francisco, and Airbnb in 2008. Social media platforms from or based in the United States that launched included Instagram in October 2010, and Snapchat in 2011 by 3 Stanford University students.

==== Space exploration ====

A number of different events would happen pertaining to the United States relating to space exploration during this period. The United States would participate in the now Russian Mir space station sending 7 astronauts to the station between 1994 and 1998 in 10 separate Space Shuttle missions. However Mir was later deorbited in 2001 and replaced with the International Space Station.

The Space Shuttle program would be continued. In 2003, Space Shuttle Columbia burned up in the atmosphere upon its reentry to Earth. After the shuttle burned up killing all 7 crew members an official governmental investigation was carried out and President Bush addressed the country about the shuttle. The Space Shuttle program was retired in 2011 doing its final flight that year.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot;, launched in 1977 by NASA became the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space in 2012. While &quot;Voyager 2&quot; (also launched in 1977 by NASA) entered interstellar space in 2018 becoming the second spacecraft to do so. The first flyby of Pluto ever was done by NASA&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons&quot; probe in 2015. The &quot;Dawn&quot; space probe launched by NASA in 2007 visited the asteroid Vesta in 2011 being the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid before later leaving next year to visit the dwarf planet Ceres entering its orbit in 2015. &quot;Dawn&quot; would be the first space craft to visit and orbit a dwarf planet.

=== Family ===
The divorce rate which was previously much higher in the 1980s and 1990s after divorce became much easier to do, started to lower in the early 21st century with it declining. Starting in 2004 the percentage of adults who were from 18 to 29 and happened to be single or never married grew while the number of those who were &quot;currently married&quot; declined.

=== Recreation and leisure ===

The United States hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. During the 1996 Summer Olympics, the United States won the most amount of medals in total. The United States also hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. However compared to the 1996 Summer Olympics, the United States won the 2nd highest amount of medals overall.

==Disasters==

===Natural disasters===
On August 24, 1992, the category-five Hurricane Andrew made landfall in South Florida, devastating the southern suburbs of Miami, including Homestead, Kendall, and Cutler Ridge. Two days later, the storm made landfall again in a sparsely populated part of Louisiana, with relatively less damage than in Florida. The storm killed 26 people directly, 39 indirectly. With $26 billion in damage, it became the costliest storm in history at that time. The storm was known for many controversies including the sluggish federal response, which may have impacted President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s image on domestic issues, as well as poor housing construction which may have led to such high levels of destruction.
In March 1993, a massive storm, known as the &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; or &quot;Superstorm&quot; struck the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. The storm set low pressure records; produced hurricane-force winds, storm surge, and killer tornadoes in Florida; and produced snowfall up to across many portions of the Eastern United States. The storm was particularly crippling to the Southern United States, where places like Birmingham, Alabama received one-and-a-half feet of snow and record low temperatures, highly unusual for the region. In all, 300 deaths were attributed to the storm and $6 billion in damage was caused.

The Great Flood of 1993 affected the Midwestern United States in the spring and summer of that year, devastating large portions of the Mississippi and Missouri River Valleys and their tributaries. Many small towns were devastated and agricultural losses were significant. 10,000 homes were destroyed and of agricultural lands were inundated. 50 people perished in the floods and $15 billion in damage was done.

In the early morning hours of January 17, 1994, the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles was hit by a 6.7 magnitude earthquake, known as the &quot;Northridge earthquake&quot;. The quake killed more than 70 people and injured 9,000. Most of the fatalities were attributed to collapsed buildings, parking structures, or freeways. Striking an urban area, it was very destructive, causing $20 billion in damage.

In July 1995, the city of Chicago was hit by a heat wave that had severe repercussions. During a five-day spell from July 12 to 16, the high temperature hovered from the mid 90s to the mid 100s. The heat index pushed 120 degrees on many days. The heat wave resulted in the deaths of over 700 people, many of whom were black, elderly, or poor. The event brought increased attention to these segments of the population and the importance of reaching out to them during heat waves, as well as the concept of the urban heat island effect, in which urban environments exacerbate heat and humidity levels. Additionally, power failures and lack of adequate warning and general preparedness aggravated the situation and may have contributed to such high fatalities.

In January 1996, the Blizzard of 1996 affected the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States, dumping up to of snow on many areas, crippling major American cities like Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston. The storm killed 150 people and caused $3 billion in damages.

On May 3, 1999, a violent tornado outbreak struck the Southern Great Plains, predominantly Oklahoma. The most destructive tornado was an F5 tornado that struck Oklahoma City and the suburb of Moore. The tornado is one of the most prominent examples of a tornado striking a major urban area and became the first tornado to incur over $1 billion in damages. In all, the outbreak resulted in 50 deaths and over 600 injuries.

In 2004, four hurricanes—Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne—struck the state of Florida in a one-month timespan, resulting in over 100 U.S. deaths and nearly $50 billion in damage combined. Out of the four hurricanes, Ivan was the deadliest in the U.S., while Charley was the most destructive.
2005 brought the second-most active Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history, only beaten by 2020. In August 2005, the powerful Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast region. Katrina broke the levees of New Orleans, Louisiana and flooded 80% of the low-lying city. Extensive devastation and flooding also occurred from Mobile, Alabama west to Beaumont, Texas, with the Mississippi coastline especially hard hit. At least 1,800 people died in the worst domestic calamity since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. Port facilities, oil rigs and refineries in the Gulf region were damaged, further increasing already high U.S. fuel prices. Residents of New Orleans, many of whom were impoverished and unable (or unwilling) to evacuate before the storm, were trapped for days by the flood waters. Tens of thousands had to be rescued by the U.S. military from their rooftops or from unsanitary and dangerous shelters in public buildings. State and local authorities were overwhelmed by the scale of the events. Their response to the disaster, as well the federal government&#x27;s, were harshly criticized by legislators and citizens who saw in the confusion a dangerous lack of readiness and inability to preserve public safety. President Bush promised that the federal government would underwrite the rebuilding of New Orleans and other storm-damaged areas, the cost of which was estimated to run as high as $200 billion. Only weeks after Katrina, Hurricane Rita struck the Texas/Louisiana border in September. Rita caused the largest evacuation in U.S. history, as millions of people fled the Houston area, as well as portions of Louisiana. Rita resulted in over 100 fatalities, the vast majority of which were indirect, occurring during the evacuation or in the aftermath of the storm. Additionally, $10 billion in damage was attributed to Rita. Later in the season, Hurricane Wilma struck the state of Florida in October 2005, killing 35 people and doing $20 billion worth of damage. The storm yielded the lowest pressure value ever recorded in history before making landfall in Florida, making it the most intense storm on record.

On Super Tuesday in February 2008, in the midst of heated primary elections in multiple states, a destructive tornado outbreak hit the Mid-South region, spawning dangerous nighttime twisters across the region. A total of 87 tornadoes were reported. Over 60 people were killed across Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Alabama and hundreds were injured. Losses exceeded $1 billion. The outbreak was the deadliest outbreak in the US in 23 years, and brought renewed attention to the dangers of nighttime tornadoes, winter tornadoes, and the vulnerability of populations in the Southern United States.

In September 2008, after two straight years of not being affected by a serious hurricane, Hurricane Gustav caused $18 billion in damage in Louisiana, and a few weeks later, the Galveston, Texas and Houston, Texas areas were devastated by Hurricane Ike with over $31 billion in damage, making Ike the third most destructive hurricane ever to hit the United States behind Hurricanes Andrew and Katrina. Over 100 people were killed. The hurricanes also caused gas prices to spike to around $4 per gallon.

In the spring of 2011, several major tornado outbreaks affected the Central and Southern United States. Forty-three people were killed in a tornado outbreak from April 14–16. Approximately 350+ people were killed in a tornado outbreak from April 25–28, the deadliest US tornado outbreak in 75 years (since the 1936 Tupelo-Gainesville tornado outbreak). States particularly hit hard by the outbreaks included Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and most especially, Alabama, which sustained over 250 fatalities alone. The latter outbreak produced $10 billion in damage, making it the costliest tornado outbreak in history. On May 22, an EF5 tornado devastated Joplin, Missouri, killing 154, injuring over 1,000 people, and causing $1–3 billion in damage, making it the deadliest single US tornado in 64 years and the costliest single tornado of all time.

In August 2011, Hurricane Irene was the first hurricane to make landfall since Ike in 2008, striking the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, making landfalls in North Carolina, New Jersey, and New York. The storm killed at least 45 people and caused $10 billion in damage. The storm was particularly notable for its extensive flooding in the Northeast, and a couple days later, Tropical Storm Lee made landfall in Louisiana, its remnants tracking to the Northeast for even more devastating floods.

In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast of the United States, making landfall near Atlantic City, New Jersey. The storm knocked out power to millions of people and caused flooding in parts of New York City along with devastation to the Jersey Shore and portions of Long Island and Staten Island. The storm has been blamed for 121 fatalities and is estimated to have caused at least $50 billion in damage.

In May 2013, at least 24 people were killed, 377 people were injured, and $1.5 to $3 billion in damage was caused when an EF5 tornado struck the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, which was hit by a deadly and destructive F5 tornado only 14 years prior.

===Other disasters===
Notable aviation disasters in the 1990s included TWA Flight 800 crashing off the coast of Long Island, en route to Paris, France, on July 17, 1996, due to an explosion of the fuel tank, killing 230 and EgyptAir Flight 990 crashing south of Nantucket, Massachusetts, en route to Cairo, Egypt, on October 31, 1999, due to deliberate crashing by the first officer, killing 217. Shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the second-deadliest U.S. aviation incident occurred when American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in Queens, New York, en route to the Dominican Republic, on November 12, 2001, due to overuse of rudder controls by the pilot to counteract turbulence, killing 265 (including 5 on the ground).

On February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disintegrated upon re-entry to the Earth over parts of Texas and Louisiana during STS-107, resulting in the deaths of all seven astronauts. The incident resulted from a piece of foam insulation that fell off during launch, which struck the shuttle, creating a hole that allowed hot gases to penetrate the shuttle during re-entry. In the aftermath of the disaster, the Space Shuttle program was suspended for 29 months as NASA investigated the incident and made plans to prevent future tragedies.

On February 17, 2003, a stampede occurred at the E2 nightclub in Chicago, after an incident involving pepper spray, resulting in the deaths of 21 people. Three days later, on February 20, 100 people perished and over 200 were injured in The Station nightclub fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island, when pyrotechnics ignited flammable sound-proofing during a performance by the band Great White. Both incidents brought attention to the need to crack down on building, fire, and safety code violations to prevent future tragedies. A porch collapse that killed 13 and seriously injured 57 in June 2003 in Chicago further emphasized the problems with building code violations in the United States.

On August 1, 2007, the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River, killing 13 people and injuring over 50. The bridge was under construction at the time. The incident brought to attention the need to inspect and rehabilitate the aging infrastructure system in the United States.

===Other disasters===

On April 20, 2010, an offshore oil drilling rig, the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot;, exploded and burned off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. Dozens of workers fled the flames and were rescued by lifeboats and helicopters, however 11 were killed and 17 were injured in the incident. The rig burned for 36 hours before sinking. On April 24, it was discovered that a damaged wellhead was leaking oil into the Gulf of Mexico at a rapid rate. For approximately 90 days, tens of thousands of barrels of oil leaked into the ocean every day, resulting in the largest oil spill in United States history. The wellhead was successfully contained in mid-July, stopping the flow, and the well was completely sealed on September 18. Despite significant efforts to protect coastlines, the spill had devastating impacts on the environment and the economies of the Gulf Coast states. The Obama administration, and civil settlements with the Justice Department and Gulf Coast states, ordered well operator BP responsible for the $15 billion cleanup costs. The spill resulted in negative public approval ratings of the US government, the Obama administration, and BP, for their handling of the spill, with BP suffering the worst ratings.

==Energy issues==

After 1970 the U.S. began importing oil, as consumption kept rising and the nation&#x27;s oil fields became less productive. Throughout the 1990s the world price of crude oil ranged between $10 and $40, and the average price at the pump did not exceed $1.40. Oil prices tripled after 2002, peaking at $147 in July 2008, about $4 a gallon; the price has continued to fluctuate widely. The theme of &quot;energy independence&quot; led to legislation mandating more fuel efficient autos—even electric vehicles—and more efficient use of energy, ranging from insulation to new light bulbs. Even worse than the high price, was the fear of shortages. Many proposals and pilot projects for replacement energy sources, from ethanol to wind power and solar power were discussed and, indeed, funded by Congress after 2000. In the economic stimulus package signed by President Obama in early 2009, billions of dollars were allocated for research and development of new energy sources.

While public attention focused on supplies from the Middle East, the main source was Canada. After 2007, new methods of extraction opened up vast new deposits of oil in the Bakken Formation in North Dakota and Montana. As much as two trillion dollars worth of natural gas is potentially available in the Marcellus Formation deposits located in the historic 19th-century oil fields in Appalachia, stretching from West Virginia through Pennsylvania into western New York. However, there is sharp debate underway regarding the environmental impact on the region&#x27;s fresh water supply. The question of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) was highly controversial, as Republican proposals were blocked by the Democrats in Congress. Republicans in 2008 were campaigning for more offshore drilling, with the slogan &quot;drill, baby, drill&quot;, but the 2010 Gulf oil spill put all new drilling on hold.

==Politics==

===Clinton administration===

Following the success of the First Gulf War, George H. W. Bush enjoyed very high approval ratings as president. However, economic recession and a reneged campaign pledge dogged Bush, sinking his formerly high approval ratings from the high 80s to the lower 40s and upper 30s. In the wake of Bush&#x27;s political problems, Bill Clinton won the 1992 contest with 43% of the vote in a three-way race against Bush&#x27;s 38%. Independent candidate Ross Perot tapped the discontent of the electorate with both parties, drawing roughly evenly from both candidates to receive a record 19% of the popular vote, but no electoral votes. Perot&#x27;s result qualified his Reform Party to receive Federal Election Commission matching funds for campaign contributions in the 1996 election, thus laying the groundwork for another three-way race during the 1996 presidential election.

Aged 46 when he took office in January 1993, Clinton was one of the youngest presidents in US history and the first born after WWII. Historians and political analysts immediately referred to him as marking a &quot;generational shift&quot; in American politics similar to when John F. Kennedy had become the first president born in the 20th century. His promising to focus on and resolve some of the United States&#x27; many domestic issues, he entered office with high expectations. Immediately, however, he was hurt when he had to withdraw major nominees (over nonpayment of taxes). Clinton&#x27;s surgeon general, Joycelyn Elders, attracted controversy over public remarks that &quot;it would be good for parents to teach their children about masturbation&quot;. Much of his planned activity was overwhelmed by the intense debate over his proposal to permit gays to serve in the military. In addition, the president had a difficult time gaining the respect of the US military establishment due to having been painted as a Vietnam War draft dodger. The outcome was a new &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; compromise policy and loss of initiative in other areas.

One early domestic victory of the Clinton administration was the enactment of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. The ban was widely decried by the Republicans, who allowed it to lapse in 2004 while they controlled both Congress and the presidency. Bill Clinton&#x27;s proposal of a national health care system, championed by his wife Hillary Clinton, ignited a political firestorm on the right, which vigorously opposed it on the general principle that government size should be reduced, not expanded. The proposed system did not survive the debate. However Hillary Clinton did succeed, along with a bipartisan coalition of members of congress, in establishing the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program.

===Republican Congress===

The New Deal, the Great Society, and Watergate helped solidify Democratic control of Congress, but the 1980s and early 1990s were a period of fragmentation of their coalition, when the popularity of Democratic incumbents as constituent servants masked growing disenchantment with Congress&#x27; governing capacities. The strongly liberal policies of Clinton&#x27;s first two years in office were also a cause of controversy, and the Democrats suddenly lost control of the House and the Senate for the first time in four decades in the 1994 midterm elections. Once in power, House Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich, faced the difficulty of learning to govern after 40 years as the minority party while simultaneously pursuing their &quot;Contract with America&quot;, which they unveiled on the steps of Congress on September 27, 1994.
Along with strong backing from traditional Democrats and liberals, Clinton was able to garner the support of moderates who appreciated his centrist &quot;New Democrat&quot; policies, which steered away from the expansion of government services of the New Deal and Great Society and allowed him to &quot;triangulate&quot;, taking away many of the Republicans&#x27; top issues. One example of such compromises was welfare reform legislation signed into law in 1996. The new law required welfare recipients to work as a condition of benefits and imposed limits on how long individuals may receive payments, but did allow states to exempt 20% of their caseloads from the time limits. Clinton also pursued tough federal anti-crime measures, steering more federal dollars toward the War on drugs, and calling for the hiring of 100,000 new police officers. Compromise came with difficulty, though, as the parties failed to agree on a budget, causing the federal government to shut down in late 1995 into early 1996. By the end of his administration, the federal government had experienced the country&#x27;s longest economic expansion and produced a budget surplus. The first year of the budget surplus was also the first year since 1969 in which the federal government did not borrow from the Social Security Trust Fund.

The 1996 Democratic National Convention in late August that nominated Clinton sparked protests, such as the one whereby Civil Rights Movement historian Randy Kryn and 10 others were arrested by the Federal Protective Service; later on, in November&#x27;s 1996 presidential election, Clinton faced Bob Dole, Republican Senator from Kansas. An uninspired insider, Dole failed to attract the support of the GOP base and the incumbent president pulled to victory in the November election. Ross Perot ran for a second time, but was not allowed at the debate between Clinton and Dole and failed to attract as much support as he had in 1992. As a sign of the general cynicism and voter apathy during this period, turnout for the election was only 49%.

Many voters in 1992 and 1996 had been willing to overlook long-standing rumors of extramarital affairs by Clinton, deeming them irrelevant. These matters came to a head, however, in February 1998 when reports surfaced of ongoing sexual relations between Clinton and a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Clinton initially and vigorously denied the relationship; &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.&quot; His wife Hillary described the allegations as fraudulent smears dredged up by a &quot;vast right-wing conspiracy.&quot; Clinton was forced to retract his assertions in August 1998 after the Lewinsky matter came under investigation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Clinton was impeached in the United States House of Representatives, but acquitted at his trial by the U.S. Senate. A public backlash forced Speaker Gingrich to resign after a poor showing in the 1998 midterm elections. In 1999, Republican Dennis Hastert of Illinois became Speaker of the House, a position he would hold until 2007, making him the longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House.

===George W. Bush administration===
Though his 2000 election had been the focus of intense controversy which led eventually to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; where the court ruled 5–4 in the former&#x27;s favor by siding with the State of Florida&#x27;s official vote count, Governor George W. Bush was sworn in as president on January 20, 2001. This made the 2000 election the third presidential election in which the electoral vote winner did not receive at least a plurality of the popular vote. Early in his term, Bush signed a $1.3 trillion federal tax cut aimed at revitalizing the economy, but the wars in the Middle East as well as assorted domestic spending packages passed by the Republican Congress led to ballooning Federal deficits. Other laws enacted in his first term included the No Child Left Behind Act education reform bill in 2002, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003 and the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act in 2004. The first eight months of his term in office were relatively uneventful; however, it had become clear by that time that the economic boom of the late 1990s was at an end. The year 2001 was plagued by a nine-month recession, witnessing the end of the boom psychology and performance, with output increasing only 0.3% and unemployment and business failures rising.

On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners and attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the September 11 attacks, killing nearly 3,000 and injuring over 6,000 people. Osama bin Laden claimed responsibility for the attacks. President Bush ordered all flights grounded and U.S. airspace remained closed for the rest of the week. An emergency bailout package for the airline industry was passed, and stocks fell dramatically when markets re-opened the following week. In response to the attacks, the Bush administration and Congress passed the controversial PATRIOT Act, aimed at enhancing security, and established the Department of Homeland Security, a mass consolidation of many federal agencies charged with investigation, intelligence, and emergency management. A new Terrorist Finance Tracking Program monitored the movements of terrorists&#x27; financial resources but was discontinued after being revealed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Telecommunication usage by known and suspected terrorists was studied through the NSA electronic surveillance program. On October 7, 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan as part of a global War on Terrorism, aimed at rooting out al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and other terrorist organizations.

In mid-2002, President Bush announced that Iraq possessed chemical and nuclear weapons and posed a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; to stability in the Middle East. Plans for a full-scale military invasion of the country began amid widespread controversy. Antiwar protests occurred around the US and numerous other countries, mostly carried out by left-wing organizations, but some on the right and various military and diplomatic figures also doubted the wisdom of this venture. Regardless, the invasion of Iraq commenced on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi Army disintegrated without much resistance and within three weeks, US troops entered Baghdad to an overjoyed mob of Iraqi civilians who proceeded to tear down the giant statue of Saddam Hussein in the middle of the city. Bush announced on May 1, 2003, from an aircraft carrier that major combat operations in Iraq were completed, with a &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; banner serving as a backdrop. Although the war was initially popular, a guerrilla insurgency quickly began mostly by Al Qaeda operatives who had entered the country. Led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a wave of bombings and beheadings of captives occurred, including the highly publicized killing of government contractor Nick Berg. Zarqawi was killed by US troops in 2005. Ineffective policing strategies led to a mounting death toll among soldiers, but eventually in 2007 a campaign known as &quot;The Surge&quot; began where the US Army launched a large-scale anti-terrorism offensive. Along with the help of Iraqi locals unhappy with the destruction caused by (largely foreigner) Al Qaeda agents, the surge resulted in the end of most major violence in the country. Late in 2003, Hussein was captured, and was subsequently put to trial before the Iraqi people and executed in 2006.

Meanwhile, the economy recovered from the early 2000s economic recession, with GDP growth rising to 7% in the middle of 2003, with continued growth through the mid-2000s. The unemployment rate peaked at 6% in 2003, before falling in 2004 and 2005, and dropping below 5% in 2006 and 2007.

President George W. Bush was re-elected in November 2004, defeating Democratic contender Senator John Kerry in the electoral vote, and receiving 50.7% of the popular vote against John Kerry&#x27;s 48.3%. Republicans also made gains in both houses of Congress. President Bush&#x27;s reelection was assured by public support for the War On Terror, the dour Senator Kerry&#x27;s lack of appeal to his voter base, and the excessive attacks made on the president by the left, which helped turn public opinion against them. In addition, it came out that Kerry, a Vietnam War veteran, had participated in antiwar protests after returning home in 1970, including throwing away his medals.

Some major acts in President Bush&#x27;s second term included the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act, and the Troubled Asset Relief Program. After seeing high approval ratings for much of his first term, Bush&#x27;s popularity plummeted to record lows in his second term, due to his handling of the prolonged Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, and the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

Democrats swept to victory in the 2006 elections, making Representative Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the first woman in that position, and electing record numbers of women and minorities. Upon winning the elections, the Democrats drew up a 100-Hour Plan of policy proposals upon assuming power in Congress. Major components of the plan included a pay-as-you-go plan for reducing the deficit; enacting the 9/11 Commission recommendations; increasing the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour; allowing the government to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to secure lower drug prices for Medicare patients; and ending large tax subsidies for big oil companies to help foster energy independence.

The 110th Congress did little to influence the war in Iraq besides passing a non-binding resolution against the Bush administration&#x27;s troop surge. In addition, the House of Representatives passed a $124 billion emergency spending measure for war funding with the stipulation of a phased troop withdrawal. President Bush vetoed the bill because of the proposal of scaling down forces, making this the second veto of his term.

During the months of May–June 2007, Senator Ted Kennedy and other senators co-sponsored the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007. The purpose of this bill called for immigration reform under the intent of bringing amnesty and citizenship. On June 28 the Senate voted 53–45 for cloture, with 60 votes needed, spelling the end to the 2007 Immigration Bill.

=== Great Recession ===
In 2007, while US unemployment dropped to its lowest level since the year 2000, the housing bubble reached its peak and economic growth slowed down, and by December 2007, the United States entered the severe long-lasting Great Recession. By mid-2008, property values and the values of other assets plummeted, and the stock market crashed in October 2008, spurred by a lack of investor confidence as the liquidity of assets began to evaporate. With the decline in wealth and the lack of investor and consumer confidence, growth and economic activity came to a screeching halt and the job growth of previous years was soon wiped out, with mass layoffs and unemployment rising rapidly in late 2008, and continuing into 2009.

Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke told a federal commission in November 2009, &quot;As a scholar of the Great Depression, I honestly believe that September and October of 2008 was the worst financial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression.&quot; Of the 13 most important US financial institutions, &quot;12 were at risk of failure within a period of a week or two&quot;.

The Federal Reserve and the Treasury cooperated by pouring trillions into a financial system that had frozen up worldwide. They rescued many of the large financial corporations from bankruptcy – with the exception of Lehman Brothers, which went bankrupt – and took government control of insurance giant AIG, mortgage banks Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and both General Motors and Chrysler.

In October 2008, Bush sought, and Congress passed, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (commonly referred to as the &quot;bank bailout&quot;) with the goal of protecting the US financial system from complete collapse in the wake of the recession, which brought significant declines in the stock market. The bill provided federal government guarantees of up to $700 billion to troubled financial institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). By 2010, only a fraction of that money was ever spent, as banks were able to quickly repay loans from the federal government or ended up never needing the money.

Meanwhile, unemployment doubled to nearly 10%, with states such as California and Michigan especially hard hit. While the stock market rebounded by 2011, and corporate profits had recovered, unemployment remained over 9% into 2011. The recession was worldwide, with Europe and Japan hard hit, while China, India and Canada fared much better.

=== Obama administration ===
The nation went into the 2008 election cycle having a Republican president and Democratic Congress both with extremely low approval ratings. New York Senator Hillary Clinton had the inside track for the nomination but faced an unexpected challenge from Barack Obama, the nearly unknown junior Senator from Illinois. The GOP nominated Arizona Senator John McCain. During the general election, Obama&#x27;s youthfulness, charisma, and widespread media support proved effective against McCain, seen as a stodgy Washington insider. In addition, his relatively advanced age (72) and injuries from captivity in the Vietnam War drew doubts over his health and stamina. Overall disillusionment with the Republican Party and George Bush&#x27;s administration did not help McCain&#x27;s cause, and his choice of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate also drew some controversy. Obama also drew some doubts over his inexperience and controversial associations with Weather Underground founder William Ayers and Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the pastor of an African-American church Obama had attended for years who was discovered to have made anti-white sermons. The decisive event was the collapse of the national financial system over the summer, launching a severe worldwide depression. On November 4, 2008, Obama defeated McCain 365 to 173 in the electoral vote and 52.9% to 45.7% in the popular vote to become the 44th president of the United States, making history in becoming the first African American to be elected to the highest executive office. Part of the strong showing came from a surge of support from younger voters, African Americans, Hispanics and independents. Democrats made further gains in Congress, adding to the majorities they had won in 2006.

Obama&#x27;s early policy decisions addressed the Great Recession and have included changes in tax policies, foreign policy initiatives and the phasing out of detention of prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. Within a few weeks of taking office, the new president and Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was ostensibly aimed at recovering from the economic collapse. This entailed a $700 billion stimulus package for the economy, although there were considerable questions over the amount of money spent or its actual effectiveness.

A domestic initiative passed by the 111th Congress and signed into law by President Obama was the Affordable Care Act, an important statute guaranteeing comprehensive medical coverage to all Americans, regardless of age, sex, pre-existing health conditions or ability to pay. The Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act, which allowed openly gay people to serve in the military, was enacted in 2010.

In foreign policy, President Obama withdrew US troops from Iraq in large numbers, bringing the Iraq War to an end in December 2011. At the same time, he also increased troop levels in the Afghanistan War. Early in his presidency, he successfully negotiated the New START treaty with the Russian Federation, which made significant reductions in their nuclear arsenals. The US also maintained ongoing talks, led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program, as well as with Israel and the Palestinian Authority over a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In May 2011, President Obama announced in a televised speech to the nation that al-Qaeda leader and culprit behind many deadly acts of terrorism (including the September 11 attacks) Osama bin Laden was killed by US forces at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

Although the recession reached its bottom in June 2009 and began to move up again, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. In the spring of 2009, large protests erupted in Washington, DC from conservative groups who began calling themselves the &quot;Tea Party&quot; and who were particularly opposed to the controversial stimulus act. The Tea Party would end up in a few years as a springboard for a large-scale Republican revival. In the 2010 midterms, the GOP retook control of the House, although the Senate remained in Democratic hands.

Under the new Congress, which had a Republican House and a Democratic Senate, President Obama and Congress clashed for months over whether or not to raise the debt ceiling and whether or not to extend the payroll tax cuts for middle-income citizens that Obama signed into law. After months of heated debate, the debt ceiling was ultimately raised and the tax cuts extended. However, Obama&#x27;s approval ratings continued to hover at around 46%, while Congress had an even lower approval rating of 11%.

In the 2012 presidential election, the GOP nominated former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. Much like John McCain four years earlier, Romney was largely seen as a tepid moderate and a Beltway insider who did not inspire the conservative base of the Republican Party, nor independents. He also drew controversy for his stand on Obamacare, which had been based on the system he implemented as Governor of Massachusetts. Obama defeated his opponent to win a second term, with a tally in the Electoral College by 332 to 206 and in the popular vote by 51.06% to 47.21%. The electoral map remained the same as 2008, with the exception of North Carolina and Indiana flipping back as red states, and the party balance in Congress remained largely unchanged.

In the November 2014 midterm elections, the Republican Party took control of the Senate and expanded its majority in the House of Representatives, an event that portended an ill omen for the Democrats.

On December 17, 2014, President Barack Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time since 1961. A deal between the United States and Cuba was brokered during 18 months of secret talks hosted by Canada, with a final meeting hosted by Pope Francis at the Vatican. Although the US embargo remains in effect and ordinary tourism by Americans is still prohibited, the United States will ease travel restrictions, release three Cuban spies, and open an embassy in Havana.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in January 2015:In short: The state of union, while far stronger than when Mr. Obama took office, remains troubled. The financial crisis has ended, with job growth picking up and the American economy among the world&#x27;s strongest right now. Yet the great 21st-century wage slowdown continues, with pay raises for most workers still meager. In other positive news, the deficit has fallen sharply, thanks to a combination of slower health-cost growth and budget cuts (the latter championed by Republicans). Many more people have health insurance, thanks to Mr. Obama&#x27;s health law. More people are graduating from college—although Mr. Obama is likely to fall short of his vow to have the United States lead the world in college graduates by 2020.
On the negative side, climate change appears to be accelerating, creating serious health and economic risks. The fall in gasoline prices, though welcome for many struggling families, won&#x27;t help the climate. And with Mr. Obama delivering his address the day after Martin Luther King&#x27;s Birthday, it&#x27;s also worth remembering that the country&#x27;s racial divides remain deep, with African-Americans still far behind other Americans by many measures.

On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled, 5–4, in the case of &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; that same-sex marriage was a constitutionally protected right under the 14th Amendment. Shortly before the ruling, polling showed the majority of Americans approving of same-sex marriage. The ruling was celebrated by many, and President Obama advertised his support for the ruling by coloring the White House in gay pride colors using lights. This ruling was not achieved without controversy, as it did little to change the minds of those that disapproved of homosexuality in general.

In regards to the Supreme Court, President Obama faced three vacancies during his administration. Justice David Souter retired in June 2009 and the president nominated as his replacement Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice in US history. Justice John Paul Stevens retired exactly one year later and Obama replaced him with Elena Kagan. Justice Antonin Scalia died on February 13, 2016. President Obama nominated Merrick Garland as his replacement, but the United States Senate, led by Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to give Garland a hearing, instead arguing that the winner of the ongoing presidential election be given the opportunity to nominate Scalia&#x27;s replacement instead. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was pressured by liberal groups to retire while the Democrats remained in control of the White House, but declined to do so.

On September 25, 2015, John Boehner announced that he would step down as Speaker and resign from Congress at the end of October 2015. Boehner&#x27;s resignation took place after Pope Francis&#x27; address to Congress the day before, an event considered by Boehner as a high point in his legislative career. Boehner was replaced by Republican Paul Ryan, the U.S. representative for Wisconsin&#x27;s 1st congressional district and former candidate for vice president along with Mitt Romney. Sources in Boehner&#x27;s office indicated he was stepping aside in the face of increasing discord while trying to manage passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government. Conservative opposition to funding Planned Parenthood as part of the resolution, and stronger threats to Boehner&#x27;s leadership on account of the controversy, prompted the abrupt announcement. Members of the caucus indicated that the resignation opened the way for a &quot;clean bill&quot; for government funding to pass, and &quot;a commitment [was] made that there [would] be no shutdown.&quot;

== Social change ==

=== &quot;A Post-Racial Nation&quot; ===

Some Americans saw the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama, and his election in 2008 as the first black president of the United States, as a sign that the nation had, in fact, become post-racial. The conservative radio host Lou Dobbs, for example, said in November 2009, &quot;We are now in a 21st-century post-partisan, post-racial society.&quot; Two months later, Chris Matthews, an MSNBC host, said of President Obama, &quot;He is post-racial by all appearances. You know, I forgot he was black tonight for an hour.&quot;

However, public opinion on whether the United States is post-racial is itself divided starkly by race. In a Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted in December 2014, about 50% of white respondents said they believed that the justice system treats Americans of all races equally, but only 10% of African Americans said the same. In the spring of 2015, according to a Gallup poll, 13 percent of black Americans surveyed identified race relations as the most important problem the United States faces, compared with 4 percent of white Americans.

Arguments that the United States is &quot;not&quot; post-racial frequently emphasize the treatment of African Americans and other racial minorities in the criminal justice system and in interactions with the police. Killings of unarmed African Americans, often by police officers, have been widely publicized. In 2015, according to a study by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, police officers in the United States killed 7.13 black Americans per million, compared with 2.91 white Americans per million. Additionally:

Such killings had a marked effect on public perceptions of race relations in America. The 13 percent of black Americans who called race relations the most pressing problem in the United States in the spring 2015 Gallup poll dwarfed the 3 percent that Gallup reported at the beginning of 2014. And the percentage of white Americans who said race relations were the most important issue rose to 4 percent in 2015 from 1 percent in 2014.

In response to high-profile incidents such as the fatal shootings of Michael Brown, Aiyana Jones, Trayvon Martin, Laquan McDonald, Tamir Rice, and Walter Scott, and the death of Freddie Gray from a spinal-cord injury sustained in police custody, academics and journalists have denounced claims that America is post-racial. Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 2015 that the phrase &quot;post-racial&quot; was &quot;usually employed by talk-show hosts and news anchors looking to measure progress in the Obama era.&quot; And Anna Holmes wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Chattel slavery and the legacies it left behind continue to shape American society. Sometimes it seems as if the desire for a &#x27;post-racial&#x27; America is an attempt by white people to liberate themselves from the burden of having to deal with that legacy.&quot;

The divide in public opinion on the status of race in America was reflected in reactions to the Black Lives Matter movement. In response to the &quot;black lives matter&quot; rallying cry, some people, including politicians, began using the phrase &quot;all lives matter&quot;. In August 2015, after a sheriff&#x27;s deputy in Harris County, Texas, was fatally shot while pumping gas, Sheriff Ron Hickman claimed that the rhetoric of Black Lives Matter activists had contributed to the killing and said, &quot;We’ve heard &#x27;black lives matter&#x27;. All lives matter. Well, cops’ lives matter, too. So why don&#x27;t we just drop the qualifier and just say &#x27;lives matter&#x27;, and take that to the bank.&#x27; Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement criticized the &quot;all lives matter&quot; phrase, arguing that it minimized the systemic threats faced by African Americans. President Obama said in October, &quot;There is a specific problem that is happening in the African-American community that&#x27;s not happening in other communities.&quot; Andrew Rosenthal wrote, similarly, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The point of &#x27;Black Lives Matter&#x27; is that the lives of African-Americans have come under special and deadly threat since before the birth of this country.&quot;

Evidence of continued racial divisions in the United States can also be found in demographics. For instance, African Americans account for less than 15 percent of the total population of Michigan, but more than 82 percent of the population of the state&#x27;s largest city, Detroit — and Detroit, like many cities whose residents are predominantly black, has &quot;self-segregated schools, dwindling tax bases and decaying public services&quot;.

=== African Americans and law enforcement ===
Even after the end of the crack epidemic, there remained a large disparity in crime rates between black people and whites, with black people accounting for 28% of arrests in 2013; over 50% of homicides and robberies where the race of the offender was known were committed by black suspects. As most crime is intraracial, most of their victims were black as well, and crime remained concentrated within black communities. Due to high crime rates, many inner city areas were heavily policed, often by police forces drawn from the population of the greater urban area rather than the local, primarily black, population, resulting in many black people feeling that they were being discriminated against by law enforcement. By 2009, black people accounted for 39.4% of the prison population in the United States. The incarceration rate of black males was over six times higher than that of white males, with a rate of 4,749 per 100,000 US residents.

In August 2014, Darren Wilson, a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri shot and killed Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black man who had robbed a nearby convenience store fifteen minutes earlier. While a grand jury investigation found that Wilson had acted in self-defense after Brown attacked him on two separate occasions, locals hostile to the police claimed that Brown had been gunned down while surrendering. Racial tensions in Ferguson between the mainly black population and mainly white police force led to both peaceful protests and riots, and several buildings were looted and set on fire. In response, the Ferguson Police Department deployed military-grade riot gear and riot control weaponry to disperse crowds and maintain order. Further protests erupted after the death of Eric Garner, a 43-year-old black resident of Staten Island, New York who died after being put in a nineteen-second long chokehold by New York City Police Department officer Daniel Pantaleo while resisting arrest. Garner was being investigated by the NYPD under suspicion of illegally selling cigarettes. Pantaleo&#x27;s acquittal by a grand jury in December led to nationwide protests by a movement which came to call itself Black Lives Matter.

<text>A surrogate key (or synthetic key, pseudokey, entity identifier, factless key, or technical key) in a database is a unique identifier for either an &quot;entity&quot; in the modeled world or an &quot;object&quot; in the database. The surrogate key is &quot;not&quot; derived from application data, unlike a &quot;natural&quot; (or &quot;business&quot;) key.

== Definition ==

There are at least two definitions of a surrogate:

; Surrogate (1) – Hall, Owlett and Todd (1976): A surrogate represents an &quot;entity&quot; in the outside world. The surrogate is internally generated by the system but is nevertheless visible to the user or application.
; Surrogate (2) – Wieringa and De Jonge (1991): A surrogate represents an &quot;object&quot; in the database itself. The surrogate is internally generated by the system and is invisible to the user or application.

The &quot;Surrogate (1)&quot; definition relates to a data model rather than a storage model and is used throughout this article. See Date (1998).

An important distinction between a surrogate and a primary key depends on whether the database is a current database or a temporal database. Since a &quot;current database&quot; stores only &quot;currently&quot; valid data, there is a one-to-one correspondence between a surrogate in the modeled world and the primary key of the database. In this case the surrogate may be used as a primary key, resulting in the term &quot;surrogate key&quot;. In a temporal database, however, there is a many-to-one relationship between primary keys and the surrogate. Since there may be several objects in the database corresponding to a single surrogate, we cannot use the surrogate as a primary key; another attribute is required, in addition to the surrogate, to uniquely identify each object.

Although Hall &quot;et al.&quot; (1976) say nothing about this, others have argued that a surrogate should have the following characteristics:

* the value is never reused
* the value is system generated
* the value is not manipulable by the user or application
* the value contains no semantic meaning
* the value is not visible to the user or application
* the value is not composed of several values from different domains.

== Surrogates in practice ==

In a current database, the surrogate key can be the primary key, generated by the database management system and &quot;not&quot; derived from any application data in the database. The only significance of the surrogate key is to act as the primary key. It is also possible that the surrogate key exists in addition to the database-generated UUID (for example, an HR number for each employee other than the UUID of each employee).

A surrogate key is frequently a sequential number (e.g. a Sybase or SQL Server &quot;identity column&quot;, a PostgreSQL or Informix codice_1, an Oracle or SQL Server codice_2 or a column defined with codice_3 in MySQL). Some databases provide UUID/GUID as a possible data type for surrogate keys (e.g. PostgreSQL codice_4 or SQL Server codice_5).

Having the key independent of all other columns insulates the database relationships from changes in data values or database design (making the database more agile) and guarantees uniqueness.

In a temporal database, it is necessary to distinguish between the surrogate key and the business key. Every row would have both a business key and a surrogate key. The surrogate key identifies one unique row in the database, the business key identifies one unique entity of the modeled world. One table row represents a slice of time holding all the entity&#x27;s attributes for a defined timespan. Those slices depict the whole lifespan of one business entity. For example, a table &quot;EmployeeContracts&quot; may hold temporal information to keep track of contracted working hours. The business key for one contract will be identical (non-unique) in both rows however the surrogate key for each row is unique.

Some database designers use surrogate keys systematically regardless of the suitability of other candidate keys, while others will use a key already present in the data, if there is one.

Some of the alternate names (&quot;system-generated key&quot;) describe the way of &quot;generating&quot; new surrogate values rather than the &quot;nature&quot; of the surrogate concept.

Approaches to generating surrogates include:

* Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs)
* Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs)
* Object Identifiers (OIDs)
* Sybase or SQL Server identity column codice_6 OR codice_7
* Oracle codice_2, or codice_9 (starting from version 12.1)
* SQL Server codice_2 (starting from SQL Server 2012) 
* PostgreSQL or IBM Informix serial
* MySQL codice_3
* SQLite codice_12 (if codice_13 is used it will prevent the reuse of numbers that have already been used but are available)
* AutoNumber data type in Microsoft Access
* codice_14 in IBM Db2 and PostgreSQL.
* Identity column (implemented in DDL) in Teradata
* Table Sequence when the sequence is calculated by a procedure and a sequence table with fields: id, sequenceName, sequenceValue and incrementValue

==Advantages==

===Stability===

Surrogate keys typically do not change while the row exists. This has the following advantages:

* Applications cannot lose their reference to a row in the database (since the identifier does not change).
* The primary or natural key data can always be modified, even with databases that do not support cascading updates across related foreign keys.

===Requirement changes===
Attributes that uniquely identify an entity might change, which might invalidate the suitability of natural keys. Consider the following example:

:An employee&#x27;s network user name is chosen as a natural key. Upon merging with another company, new employees must be inserted. Some of the new network user names create conflicts because their user names were generated independently (when the companies were separate).

In these cases, generally a new attribute must be added to the natural key (for example, an &quot;original_company&quot; column).
With a surrogate key, only the table that defines the surrogate key must be changed. With natural keys, all tables (and possibly other, related software) that use the natural key will have to change.

Some problem domains do not clearly identify a suitable natural key. Surrogate keys avoid choosing a natural key that might be incorrect.

===Performance===

Surrogate keys tend to be a compact data type, such as a four-byte integer. This allows the database to query the single key column faster than it could multiple columns (which are often text - which is even further slower). Furthermore, a non-redundant distribution of keys causes the resulting b-tree index to be completely balanced. Surrogate keys are also less expensive to join (fewer columns to compare) than compound key.

===Compatibility===

While using several database application development systems, drivers, and object–relational mapping systems, such as Ruby on Rails or Hibernate, it is much easier to use an integer or GUID surrogate keys for every table instead of natural keys in order to support database-system-agnostic operations and object-to-row mapping.

===Uniformity===

When every table has a uniform surrogate key, some tasks can be easily automated by writing the code in a table-independent way.

===Validation===

It is possible to design key-values that follow a well-known pattern or structure which can be automatically verified. For instance, the keys that are intended to be used in some column of some table might be designed to &quot;look differently from&quot; those that are intended to be used in another column or table, thereby simplifying the detection of application errors in which the keys have been misplaced. However, this characteristic of the surrogate keys should never be used to drive any of the logic of the applications themselves, as this would violate the principles of database normalization.

===Simplicity of Relationships===

Surrogate keys simplify the creation of foreign key relationships because they only require a single column (as opposed to composite keys - which require multiple columns). When creating a query on the database, forgetting to include all the columns in a composite foreign key when joining tables can lead to unexpected results in the form of an undesired cartesian product.

==Disadvantages==

===Disassociation===
The values of generated surrogate keys have no relationship to the real-world &quot;meaning&quot; of the data held in a row. When inspecting a row holding a foreign key reference to another table using a surrogate key, the meaning of the surrogate key&#x27;s row cannot be discerned from the key itself. Every foreign key must be joined to see the related data item. If appropriate database constraints have not been set, or data imported from a legacy system where referential integrity was not employed, it is possible to have a foreign-key value that does not correspond to a primary-key value and is therefore invalid. (In this regard, C.J. Date regards the meaninglessness of surrogate keys as an advantage.)

To discover such errors, one must perform a query that uses a left outer join between the table with the foreign key and the table with the primary key, showing both key fields in addition to any fields required to distinguish the record; all invalid foreign-key values will have the primary-key column as NULL. The need to perform such a check is so common that Microsoft Access actually provides a &quot;Find Unmatched Query&quot; wizard that generates the appropriate SQL after walking the user through a dialog. (It is, however, not too difficult to compose such queries manually.) &quot;Find Unmatched&quot; queries are typically employed as part of a data cleansing process when inheriting legacy data.

Surrogate keys are unnatural for data that is exported and shared. A particular difficulty is that tables from two otherwise identical schemas (for example, a test schema and a development schema) can hold records that are equivalent in a business sense, but have different keys. This can be mitigated by not exporting surrogate keys, except as transient data (most obviously, in executing applications that have a &quot;live&quot; connection to the database).

When surrogate keys supplant natural keys, then domain specific referential integrity will be compromised. For example, in a customer master table, the same customer may have multiple records under separate customer IDs, even though the natural key (a combination of customer name, date of birth, and e-mail address) would be unique. To prevent compromise, the natural key of the table must not be supplanted: it must be preserved as a unique constraint, which is implemented as a unique index on the combination of natural-key fields.

===Query optimization===
Relational databases assume a unique index is applied to a table&#x27;s primary key. The unique index serves two purposes: (i) to enforce entity integrity, since primary key data must be unique across rows and (ii) to quickly search for rows when queried. Since surrogate keys replace a table&#x27;s identifying attributes—the natural key—and since the identifying attributes are likely to be those queried, then the query optimizer is forced to perform a full table scan when fulfilling likely queries. The remedy to the full table scan is to apply indexes on the identifying attributes, or sets of them. Where such sets are themselves a candidate key, the index can be a unique index.

These additional indexes, however, will take up disk space and slow down inserts and deletes.

===Normalization===
Surrogate keys can result in duplicate values in any natural keys. To prevent duplication, one must preserve the role of the natural keys as unique constraints when defining the table using either SQL&#x27;s codice_15 statement or codice_16 statement, if the constraints are added as an afterthought.

===Business process modeling===
Because surrogate keys are unnatural, flaws can appear when modeling the business requirements. Business requirements, relying on the natural key, then need to be translated to the surrogate key. A strategy is to draw a clear distinction between the logical model (in which surrogate keys do not appear) and the physical implementation of that model, to ensure that the logical model is correct and reasonably well normalised, and to ensure that the physical model is a correct implementation of the logical model.

===Inadvertent disclosure===
Proprietary information can be leaked if surrogate keys are generated sequentially. By subtracting a previously generated sequential key from a recently generated sequential key, one could learn the number of rows inserted during that time period. This could expose, for example, the number of transactions or new accounts per period. For example see German tank problem.

There are a few ways to overcome this problem:

* increase the sequential number by a random amount;
* generate a random key such as a UUID.

===Inadvertent assumptions===
Sequentially generated surrogate keys can imply that events with a higher key value occurred after events with a lower value. This is not necessarily true, because such values do not guarantee time sequence as it is possible for inserts to fail and leave gaps which may be filled at a later time. If chronology is important then date and time must be separately recorded.

<text>The Philadelphia Zoo is a zoo located in the Centennial District of Philadelphia on the west bank of the Schuylkill River. It was the first true zoo in the United States; it was chartered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on March 21, 1859, but its opening was delayed by the Civil War until July 1, 1874. The zoo opened with 1,000 animals and an admission price of 25 cents. For a brief time, the zoo also housed animals brought to U.S. from safaris by the Smithsonian Institution, which had not yet built its National Zoo.

The Philadelphia Zoo is one of the premier zoos in the world for breeding animals that are difficult to breed in captivity. The zoo also works with many groups around the world to protect the natural habitats of the animals in their care.

The zoo is and the home of nearly 1,300 animals, many of which are rare and endangered. Special features include a children&#x27;s petting zoo, a rainforest themed carousel, a climbing structure, chats with keepers, behind the scenes tours available for purchase, and many interactive and educational exhibits.

==History==

The opening of the London Zoo to the public in 1847 inspired America&#x27;s intellectual class to show interest in building a zoo in the U.S. Dr. William Camac of Philadelphia had traveled throughout Europe in the 1850&#x27;s and visited the London Zoo. Upon returning to the U.S. he advocated to build a Zoo in Philadelphia. On March 21, 1859, the Pennsylvania legislature incorporated the Zoological Society of Philadelphia. The incorporation paper reads: &quot;The purpose of this corporation shall be the purchase and collection of living wild and other animals, for the purpose of public exhibition at some suitable place in the City of Philadelphia, for the instruction and recreation of the people.&quot; Camac worked with other Zoological Society members to raise funds and secured 33 acres on the West Philadelphia side of the Schuylkill River previously owned by John Penn, grandson of William Penn. The opening of the Zoo was delayed by the Civil War which lasted from 1861 to 1865.

When the Philadelphia Zoological Garden first opened its Victorian gates on July 1, 1874, to over 3,000 visitors, it was the only institution of its kind in the New World. The zoo began with varied exhibits containing 200 mammals, including buffalo, deer, wolves, foxes, bears, and monkeys, and 67 bird species and 15 reptiles. Reptiles and small mammals were housed in The Solitude, a mansion built by John Penn in 1785. A carriage house was located at the entrance for horses that had transported visitors to the zoo. The landscaping and architecture mimicked a Victorian garden atmosphere that is still represented in the present zoo grounds.

The 1876 Centennial Exposition was held in Fairmount Park, a few blocks from the zoo. U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant had officiated at the Exposition and visited the zoo on April 23. Zoo attendance increased to nearly 680,000 visitors in 1876, a 36 percent increase over the preceding year, and set a record that would remain unmatched until nearly 858,000 visited in 1951.

The Penrose Research Laboratory was established in 1901. The first of its kind in any zoo, the Penrose Research Lab contributed to a reduced rate of disease, increased vigor, and longevity among zoo animals. In 1901, the lab began performing necropsies on every zoo animal that became ill and died. The lab&#x27;s history of preventive medicine reflected the foresight of Dr. Charles B. Penrose and Dr. Cortland Y. White, professors at the Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania.

The zoo received railroad visitors at the Zoological Garden station on 34th Street and Girard Avenue from its opening in 1874 until the station was closed in 1902. Since 2013, zoo officials have been working to get the station restored and reopened, to potentially increase attendance and alleviate parking issues on their busiest days.

Philadelphia Zoo has developed a distinguished breeding program over the years and is credited with many &quot;firsts&quot; including: the first successful birth of an orangutan and a chimpanzee in a U.S. zoo in 1928, the first cheetahs born in a zoo in 1956, the first successful birth of an echidna in North America in 1983, and the first successful birth of a giant river otter in North America in 2004. The first recorded parent-reared Guam kingfisher was bred at the zoo in 1985.

Philadelphia Zoo also pioneered the first captive management of flamingos under the direction of curator emeritus John A. Griswold. Through innovative feeding techniques, the zoo was the first to gain the pink and red pigmentation of these birds. The zoo was the first to successfully breed Chilean and greater flamingos in captivity.

The brown tree snake was introduced to the island of Guam in the 1940s, and as a result, bird species endemic to the island were driven to extinction in the wild by the invasive serpent. In 1983, the Guam Bird Rescue Project was spearheaded by the Philadelphia Zoo in an attempt to save the Guam kingfisher and the Guam rail, two native species still present in large enough numbers to benefit from intervention. The rescue plan called for the capture of all kingfishers and rails on Guam, along with the development of a captive management program. The captive breeding was carried out in U.S. zoos in an effort to save the two species from extinction until reintroduction became feasible.

In the early morning of December 24, 1995, a fire in the &quot;World of Primates&quot; building killed 23 animals, including a family group of six western lowland gorillas, a family group of three orangutans, four white-handed gibbons, and 10 lemurs (two ruffed lemurs, six ring-tailed lemurs, and two mongoose lemurs). All were members of endangered species. The animals died in their sleep from smoke inhalation (carbon monoxide poisoning); none were burned. 10 primates housed in an adjoining building, the Discovery House, survived. At the time of the fire, detection equipment existed in only 20 percent of the zoo buildings; the primates building, which had been constructed in 1985, was not one of them. In the 10 months following the fire, the zoo installed fire detection equipment in all animal buildings.

On July 1, 1999, the zoo opened a new primate exhibit featuring of indoor and outdoor areas with 10 species of primates, including Sumatran orangutans, western lowland gorillas, lemurs, langurs, and gibbons. In 2006, the zoo opened a new big cat exhibit showcasing lions, Siberian tigers, Amur leopards, snow leopards, cougars, and jaguars in exhibit spaces reminiscent of their natural habitats. On May 30, 2009, the zoo opened a new aviary featuring two birds that are extinct in the wild: the Guam rail and the Guam kingfisher. In July 2009, the last two elephants, both African bush, were relocated to a sanctuary.

In 2010, a special exhibit called &quot;Creatures of Habitat&quot; was unveiled featuring 10 animal stations throughout the zoo, with endangered animals represented by more than 30 life-size Lego brick statues. The statues were created by Lego-certified professional artist Sean Kenney.

Philadelphia Zoo opened Treetop Trail in 2011, the first component of its Zoo360 animal exploration trail system. Zoo360 is a network of see-through mesh trails, consisting of elevated and ground-level structures, along which animals can explore the zoo away from their enclosures. Subsequent additions to the system include the Great Ape Trail, Big Cat Crossing, Gorilla Treeway, and Meerkat Maze.

On April 13, 2013, the zoo opened KidZooU on the site of the old Pachyderm House. Also known as the Hamilton Family Children&#x27;s Zoo and Faris Family Education Center, it is one of the largest projects undertaken by the zoo and replaces the old Children&#x27;s Zoo open for over 50 years prior. KidZooU is notable for many ecologically conscious features, such as rain gardens and cisterns, geothermal wells, and green roofs, making it the first LEED-certified exhibit at the zoo.

On December 29, 2016, Zenda, the oldest African lion in the U.S. zoo population, was euthanized following a sudden loss of appetite and failing health. Zenda was 25. On February 20, 2018, Coldilocks, a 37-year-old polar bear was euthanized after declining health including potential liver and spinal problems. The average age for a polar bear in the wild is 23 years.

A snake mascot, Phang, was introduced at Philadelphia Zoo on September 10, 2018.
In 2019, the zoo opened WildWorks, a high ropes course with bridges, ropes, and obstacles. Participants wear climbing harnesses. Two courses are available, each designed for a different age group and skill level. A smaller system for children under is also available.

During the Holiday Season (Late November to Early January), the Philadelphia Zoo hosts a walking nighttime light show called Luminature. Luminature includes holiday music and over 1 million lights throughout 16 illuminated zones around the Zoo. There are also numerous shopping, food and drink outlets. The experience also includes actors dressed as illuminated animals and the chance to sit in a fire pit area and make s&#x27;mores. 

==Features==
* Zoo360: a first-of-its-kind animal trail system, consisting of five trails—Big Cat Crossing, Gorilla Treeway, Treetop Trail, Great Ape Trail, and Meerkat Maze—which allow the animals to travel along suspended and ground-level mesh structures throughout parts of the zoo.

<text>HMS &quot;Ilex&quot; was one of nine s built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. She is the only ship of the Royal Navy ever to have been named after &quot;Ilex&quot;, the genus of flowering plants commonly known as holly.

==Description==
The I-class ships were improved versions of the preceding H-class. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and were intended to give a maximum speed of . &quot;Ilex&quot; only reached a speed of from during her sea trials. The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . Their crew numbered 145 officers and ratings.

The ships mounted four 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The I class was fitted with two above-water quintuple torpedo tube mounts amidships for  torpedoes. One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 16 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. The I-class ships were fitted with the ASDIC sound detection system to locate submarines underwater.

==Construction and career==
===1939===
On the outbreak of war &quot;Ilex&quot; was deployed in the Mediterranean with the Third Destroyer Flotilla. She was immediately transferred to the Western Approaches for convoy escort duty with her flotilla. On 13 October under the command of Lieutenant Commander Philip Lionel Saumarez she attacked and sank south-west of Ireland in company with the destroyer .

===1940===

The first half of 1940 saw &quot;Ilex&quot; conducting Fleet screening duties in and around the North Sea. In May she transferred to the Second Destroyer Flotilla for service in the Mediterranean. On 27 June 1940, in company with , , and the Australian destroyer she depth-charged the off Crete. The submarine was forced to the surface and scuttled by her crew. Two days later, on 29 June, the ships attacked and probably sank the at around 0615, although submarine might have been sunk by an RAF Sunderland later that day. Also on 29 June &quot;Dainty&quot; and &quot;Ilex&quot; shared in the sinking of the south-west of Crete. &quot;Ilex&quot; participated in the Battle of Calabria and on 19 June escorted during the sinking of the off Cape Spada, rescuing 230 survivors. Service with the Mediterranean Fleet continued through 1940 and on 11 November she was deployed as a screening destroyer for during the Battle of Taranto the air attack on the Italian Fleet.

===1941===
On 20 March she formed part of the destroyer screen for the fleet at the Battle of Cape Matapan. On 14 June she suffered major structural damage from dive-bombing near misses during an operation to prevent interference by Vichy French warships. She was towed to Haifa and underwent a series of temporary repairs there, and at Suez, Aden, Mombassa and Durban, in order to reach the United States of America for a refit and full repair.

===1942===
It was not until September 1942 that &quot;Ilex&quot; was re-commissioned. She spent the rest of the year at Freetown, Sierra Leone, conducting convoy duties.

===1943===
In February 1943 &quot;Ilex&quot; returned to the Mediterranean, and in July and August she participated in the Sicily and Salerno landings. On 13 July, she sank, with assistance from , the south east of the Straits of Messina. In December she was withdrawn from operational service because of a high defect load and poor availability.

===1944===
&quot;Ilex&quot; was laid up at Bizerte in Tunisia, then transferred to Ferryville in June, and laid up there.

===1945===
In March 1945 the destroyer was towed to Malta for repair, and in April reduced to &quot;reserve category C&quot;, the survey declaring her &quot;not required for further operational service&quot;. She was placed on the disposal list in August.

==Disposal==
&quot;Ilex&quot; was sold for scrap at Malta on 22 January 1946 and broken up in Sicily in 1948.

==Sea Cadet Corps==
Salford Sea Cadets are affiliated with the ship and are named TS &quot;Ilex&quot;. Salford sea cadets are located in Worsley and provide youth services to young people aged 10–18 across the City of Salford.

The unit was incorporated in 1936 during Eccles warship week and is one of the oldest continuously operating youth groups in the city. The current City of Salford Sea Cadets is an amalgamation of Eccles and District Sea Cadets (TS Ilex) and Salford Sea Cadets (TS Irwell). The unit moved to its present home in Worsley in the late 1980s.

City of Salford Sea Cadets while an independent charity in its own right is also part of the larger Sea Cadet Corps

<doc id="472959" wikidata="Q3022185" url="?curid=472959" title="HMS Inglefield">
<text>HMS &quot;Inglefield&quot; was an leader built for the Royal Navy that served during World War II. She was the navy&#x27;s last purpose-built flotilla leader. She was named after the 19th century Admiral Sir Edward Augustus Inglefield (1820–1894), and is so far the only warship to carry the name of that seafaring family. In May 1940, her pennant number was changed to I02.

==Description==
The I-class ships were improved versions of the preceding H-class. &quot;Inglefield&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and were intended to give a maximum speed of . &quot;Inglefield&quot; reached a speed of from during her sea trials. The ship carried enough fuel oil to give her a range of at . Her crew numbered 175 officers and ratings.

The ship mounted five 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, &quot;Inglefield&quot; was fitted with two quadruple mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The I class was fitted with two above-water quintuple torpedo tube mounts amidships for  torpedoes. One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 16 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. The I-class ships were fitted with the ASDIC sound detection system to locate submarines underwater.

==Anti-submarine action==
On the outbreak of war, &quot;Inglefield&quot; was deployed as the leader of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, Mediterranean Fleet, and was based at Malta. However, she was transferred to the Home Fleet before the end of September 1939 to patrol the Western Approaches. In this rôle, she escorted the aircraft carrier , but was answering a distress signal from when &quot;Courageous&quot; was attacked and sunk. &quot;Inglefield&quot; searched in vain for the U-boat that sank the carrier. One month later, &quot;Inglefield&quot;, along with her sister ships and , sank U-boat off the southwest coast of Ireland. She again came under attack from Nazi U-boats when fired numerous torpedoes at her; they all missed. A few days after that last attack, the ship was required to tow the submarine back to Stavanger, after she was damaged while on patrol in the North Sea. Inglefield sank another German U-boat, , in early 1940 with the help of her sister and the submarine ; 24 Germans were rescued.

==Operation Weserübung==
In May 1940, after the failure of British forces in Norway, &quot;Inglefield&quot; was called upon to evacuate British troops from the Norwegian town of Åndalsnes. In June, she escorted the damaged destroyers and (which had collided with each other whilst escorting the aircraft carrier during air attacks on Trondheim) back to port. It was a slow trip as &quot;Electra&quot;″s bow was damaged. Things were not helped by a violent storm which lasted for half of the journey time, during which, an ammunition locker on &quot;Electra&quot;″s forecastle broke loose and started sliding around the deck.

==Pursuing German battleships==
&quot;Inglefield&quot; was deployed to the North Sea with the destroyer to escort the battlecruisers and in an unsuccessful operation to seek and destroy the . It was believed that she was the heavy cruiser , and a massive naval effort by the Royal Navy failed to stop her from returning to a German port.
Perhaps her most famous role was in May 1941 when she served as part of the escort for the battleships and in the pursuit and destruction of the German battleship .

In August, she was present at Scapa Flow for a visit by King George VI, and even embarked the King for the review of the fleet and then for return passage to the mainland on 9 August.

==Convoy defence==
She was part of the escort for the first convoy to the USSR, along with the aircraft carriers , and then . She would regularly return to escort duties in the Arctic, as she was often deployed with the Home Fleet. But occasionally she was sent elsewhere on a particular mission. One example was in early 1942 when she supported commando raids on the Norwegian coast and bombarded Florø with her sister ship , an action which sank three ships and damaged on-shore factories. Another example was in April 1942 when she was also deployed to the Mediterranean to escort the American carrier to Malta in April 1942. On 3 July 1942, she was detached from an Arctic convoy to search for the German battleship , which was reported to have left her normal anchorage. In 1943, she was transferred from Arctic convoy duty to Atlantic convoy defence, but she still spent much of her time in home waters.

==Italian invasion==

Her next major deployment was in July 1943, when she took part in the invasion of Sicily. She was one of 18 British, Greek and Polish destroyers which, along with four Royal Navy cruisers, made up the escort for the battleships , , and , the aircraft carriers and in the Ionian Sea. &quot;Inglefield&quot;″s main role was to search for U-boats and to bombard enemy positions ashore. Throughout the operations on Sicily, she was based at Malta. When the invasion of Italy took place, &quot;Inglefield&quot; supported the landings at Salerno in a similar way. After the beachhead was established, she formed the escort back to home waters, but was soon sent back to the Mediterranean Sea for operations in Italy. One task was to escort , with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on board, from Algiers to Alexandria.

During Operation Shingle in early 1944, &quot;Inglefield&quot; carried out a diversionary bombardment of Civitavecchia to draw Axis forces away from Anzio. She then bombarded the coastal road at Formia for two days before supporting forces on the ground at Anzio. The ship operated out of Naples, ferrying supplies and troops to the battle, as well as continuing to provide covering fire and bombardment of coastal roads.

==Last action==
On 15 February 1944, she escorted an ammunition ship from Naples to Anzio. She then took up a defensive position to protect the anchorage in Anzio. She was in this capacity for ten days before sustaining a direct hit by a Henschel Hs 293 glider bomb launched by II./KG 100 during a dusk attack and was sunk with the loss of 35 lives. 157 survivors were rescued and returned to the United Kingdom. Among the survivors was Jack Rumbold, the last officer to abandon ship and who was mentioned in dispatches for his actions during the sinking.

<text>National Chi Nan University (NCNU; ) is a public university located in Puli Township, Nantou County, Taiwan.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
The National Chi Nan University Planning Committee was established on 1 March 1991 in order to establish a university with the following missions:
# To provide more higher education opportunities.
# To improve the education of Overseas Taiwanese.
# To assist in developing industries as a part of Six-Year National Construction Plan of Taiwan.
# To balance cultural and educational development between regions.

Land which had been the property of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation was selected as the campus of the new university in January 1992. The initial phase of construction of the university was completed in July 1995. The first classes of graduate students were enrolled at the University in September 1995. The first classes of undergraduates registered in September 1996, along with the official opening of the campus.

===921 earthquake===
When the devastating 1999 Jiji earthquake struck Nantou County on 21 September 1999 (921), all major buildings and dormitories in campus were critically damaged, and the University suffered a great loss of equipment and basic infrastructure. President Ricard Lee had led the three-day evacuation of the entire student body and the provisional relocation to the campus of National Taiwan University in Taipei City for one semester. The restoration of the campus was mostly completed in the following six months. The student body and all the Colleges went back to the campus in the next semester.

The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . Their crew numbered 145 officers and ratings.

The ships mounted four 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern. While under construction, their anti-aircraft (AA) armament was augmented by a single 12-pounder () AA gun that replaced the planned aft set of torpedo tubes. In addition the intended pair of quadruple mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun were replaced by a pair of Oerlikon light AA guns. The Turkish ships were fitted with a single above-water quadruple torpedo tube mount amidships for  torpedoes. One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted for 35 depth charges. The Turkish ships were fitted with the ASDIC sound detection system to locate submarines underwater and a Type 286 search radar.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Ithuriel&quot; was laid down as &quot;Gayret&quot; for the Turkish Navy by Vickers Armstrong at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard on 24 May 1939, but it was taken over by the Royal Navy at the outbreak of the Second World War whilst still under construction. She was launched on 15 December 1940 and commissioned on 3 March 1942. In the Second World War, she took part in Operation Harpoon &amp; Operation Pedestal, the escorting of convoys to Malta in June &amp; August 1942. During Operation Pedestal, she depth charged &amp; rammed the , causing the submarine to sink.

&quot;Ithuriel&quot; was attacked by German aircraft at Bone in Algeria on the night of 27–28 November 1942 and damaged beyond repair. On 29 November, she was beached &amp;temporary repairs were started. In January 1943, repairs proceeded enough to allow for towing. On 27 February, the destroyer was towed to Algiers for survey. In March, &quot;Ithuriel&quot; was declared beyond local repair and laid up at Algiers.

In August, she was prepared for tow to Gibraltar. On 18 August, she sailed under tow from Algiers to Gibraltar. That September &quot;Ithuriel&quot; was placed in care and maintenance for use at Gibraltar. In October, she was deployed at Gibraltar for accommodation &amp; training duties.

In July 1944, the vessel was prepared for tow to the United Kingdom. On 1 August, &quot;Ithuriel&quot; began her passage to Plymouth under tow by the tug &quot;Prosperous&quot;. On 8 August, she was paid off on arrival at Plymouth and placed on the Disposal List. The destroyer was sold to the British Iron &amp; Steel Corporation for demolition by P &amp; W McLellan. On 11 August, &quot;Ithuriel&quot; made her final voyage to Bo&#x27;ness, near Edinburgh. She arrived on 13 August at the breaker&#x27;s yard. (Discrepancy in records as to whether she was sold for scrap in 1944 or 1945.)

<text>The sapsuckers are species of North American woodpeckers in the genus Sphyrapicus.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genus &quot;Sphyrapicus&quot; was introduced in 1858 by the American naturalist Spencer Baird with the yellow-bellied sapsucker (&quot;Sphyrapicus varius&quot;) as the type species. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;sphura&quot; meaning &quot;hammer&quot; and &quot;pikos&quot; meaning &quot;woodpecker&quot;. The genus is sister to the genus &quot;Melanerpes&quot;; both genera are members of the tribe Melanerpini in the woodpecker subfamily Picinae.

There are four currently recognized species in the genus:





==Description==
The members of this genus are slender birds with stiff tails and relatively long wings. Their typical pattern in flight is undulating, alternating between quick bursts of wing beats and short dips with wings tucked against the body.

==Behavior==

As their name implies, sapsuckers feed primarily on the sap of trees, moving among different tree and shrub species on a seasonal basis. Insects, especially those attracted to the sweet sap exuding from sap holes, are often captured and fed to the young during the breeding season. The most easily recognized sap holes are found in birch trees during the breeding season.

Because sapsuckers attack living trees, they are often considered a pest species. Intensive feeding by sapsuckers is a cause of severe tree damage and mortality, with certain tree species more adversely affected by feeding than others. A USDA Forest Service study found that 67 percent of gray birch (&quot;Betula populifolia&quot;) trees damaged by yellow-bellied sapsuckers later died of their injuries. This compares to a mortality of 51 percent for paper birch (&quot;Betula papyrifera&quot;), 40 percent for red maple (&quot;Acer rubrum&quot;), 3 percent for red spruce (&quot;Picea rubens&quot;), and 1 percent for hemlock (&quot;Tsuga canadensis&quot;).

<text>Heqin, also known as marriage alliance, refers to the historical practice of Chinese monarchs marrying princesses—usually members of minor branches of the ruling family—to rulers of neighboring states. It was often adopted as an appeasement strategy with an enemy state that was too powerful to defeat on the battlefield. The policy was not always effective. It implied an equal diplomatic status between the two monarchs. As a result, it was controversial and had many critics.

Lou Jing (, later granted the imperial surname Liu 劉), the architect of the policy, proposed granting the eldest daughter of Emperor Gaozu of Han to Modu Chanyu of the Xiongnu. His proposal was adopted and implemented with a treaty in 198BC, following the Battle of Baideng two years prior. Wang Zhaojun, of the Han dynasty, and Princess Wencheng, of the Tang dynasty, are among the most famous heqin princesses.

The 20th-century scholar Wang Tonglin praised heqin for facilitating the &quot;melting of races&quot; in China.

==Han dynasty==
There were a total of fifteen instances of &quot;heqin&quot; marriage alliances during the Han dynasty.

The Han dynasty sent random unrelated commoner women falsely labeled as &quot;princesses&quot; and members of the Han imperial family multiple times when they were practicing Heqin marriage alliances with the Xiongnu in order to avoid sending the emperor&#x27;s daughters.
*200BC: Emperor Gaozu of Han marries a Han &quot;princess&quot; to Xiongnu chieftain Modu Chanyu. This is the first recorded incidence of heqin in Chinese history.
*192BC: Emperor Hui of Han marries another Han &quot;princess&quot; to Xiongnu chieftain Modu Chanyu.
*176BC: Emperor Wen of Han marries a third Han &quot;princess&quot; to Xiongnu chieftain Modu Chanyu.
*174BC: Emperor Wen of Han marries a Han &quot;princess&quot; to Xiongnu chieftain Laoshang Chanyu. She brings a Yan eunuch named Zhonghang Yue with her to be her tutor.
*162BC: Emperor Wen of Han marries another Han &quot;princess&quot; to Xiongnu chieftain Laoshang Chanyu.
*160BC: Emperor Wen of Han marries a Han &quot;princess&quot; to Xiongnu chieftain Gunchen Chanyu.
*156BC: Emperor Jing of Han marries another Han &quot;princess&quot; to Xiongnu chieftain Gunchen Chanyu.
*155BC: Emperor Jing of Han marries a third Han &quot;princess&quot; to Xiongnu chieftain Gunchen Chanyu.
*152BC: Emperor Jing of Han marries a fourth Han &quot;princess&quot; to Xiongnu chieftain Gunchen Chanyu.
*140BC: Emperor Wu of Han marries a Han &quot;princess&quot; to Xiongnu chieftain Gunchen Chanyu.
*108BC: Emperor Wu of Han marries Liu Xijun (刘细君 130–101 BC), daughter of Liu Jian (刘建), Prince of Jiangdu (江都王 d. 121 BC), granddaughter of Prince Yi of Jiangdu, to Liejiaomi, King of Wusun.
*103BC: Emperor Wu of Han marries Liu Jieyou (刘解忧 121–49 BC) to King Junxumi of Wusun (Liejiaomi&#x27;s grandson). After Junxumi&#x27;s death in 93BC, Princess Jieyou, in accordance with Wusun tradition, married his successor (and younger brother), King Wengguimi. After Wengguimi&#x27;s death in 60BC, Princess Jieyou again remarried his successor King Nimi (son of Junximi and a Xiongnu princess).
*33BC: Emperor Yuan of Han marries Wang Zhaojun (王昭君 52 BC – 15), a lady of the imperial harem, to Xiongnu chieftain Huhanye. After Huhanye&#x27;s death in 31BC, she remarried Huhanye&#x27;s successor (his son by his first wife and thus her stepson) Fuzhuleiruodi Chanyu.

===Xiongnu===
The Xiongnu practiced marriage alliances with Han dynasty officers and officials by marrying off daughters of the Chanyu (the Xiongnu ruler) to Han people who joined the Xiongnu and Xiongnu in Han service. The daughter of the Laoshang Chanyu (and older sister of Junchen Chanyu and Yizhixie Chanyu) was married to the Xiongnu General Zhao Xin, the Marquis of Xi who was serving the Han dynasty. The daughter of the Qiedihou Chanyu was married to the Han general Li Ling after he surrendered and defected. The Yenisei Kirghiz Khagans claimed descent from Li Ling. Another Han general who defected to the Xiongnu was Li Guangli who also married a daughter of the Hulugu Chanyu. The Han diplomat Su Wu married a Xiongnu woman given by Li Ling when he was arrested and taken captive. The Han explorer Zhang Qian married a Xiongnu woman and had a child with her when he was taken captive by the Xiongnu. The Emperor Wu of Han dispatched Zhang Qian to explore the Western Regions and to form an alliance with the Yuezhi people in order to combat the Xiongnu. During this time Zhang married a Xiongnu wife, who bore him a son, and gained the trust of the Xiongnu leader.

The Yenisei Kyrgyz khagans of the Yenisei Kyrgyz Khaganate claimed descent from the Han general Li Ling, grandson of the famous general Li Guang. Li Ling was captured by the Xiongnu and defected in the first century BCE. And since the Tang imperial Li family also claimed descent from Li Guang, the Kirghiz Khagan was therefore recognized as a member of the Tang imperial family. This relationship soothed the relationship when Kyrgyz khagan Are (阿熱) invaded Uyghur Khaganate and put Qasar Qaghan to the sword. The news brought to Chang&#x27;an by Kyrgyz ambassador Zhuwu Hesu (註吾合素).
Ban Zhi married a Xiongnu Jin royal woman from the Xiutu royal family 

==Kingdom of Khotan==
The Cao family of ethnic Han descent that ruled the Guiyi Circuit established marriage alliances with the Saka Kingdom of Khotan, with both the Cao rulers marrying Khotanese princesses and with Cao princesses marrying Khotan rulers. A Khotan princess who was the daughter of the King of Khotan married Cao Yanlu.

==Sixteen Kingdoms==
During the Sixteen Kingdoms period, there were a total of six recorded instances of &quot;heqin&quot; marriage. &quot;Heqin&quot; marriage alliances during the Sixteen Kingdoms period differed from those practiced during the Han dynasty in two main ways. First, they involved &quot;real&quot; princesses (i.e. daughters of emperors or rulers). Second, unlike during the Han dynasty, when most &quot;heqin&quot; marriages were aimed at establishing peace with foreign nations, &quot;heqin&quot; marriages during the Sixteen Kingdoms period were made primarily to settle rivalries and maintain a balance of power between the various states in China at the time.

*Fu Jian (337–385), Emperor Xuanzhao of Former Qin, married one of his daughters to Yang Ding, ruler of the state of Chouchi.
*Fu Deng, Emperor Gao of Former Qin, married his younger sister, Princess Dongping (东平公主) to Qifu Gangui, Prince of Western Qi.

*415: Yao Xing, Emperor Wenhuan of Later Qin, married his daughter, Princess Xiping (西平公主), to Emperor Mingyuan of Northern Wei. Because she was unable to forge a golden statue with her own hands, she was never formally empress, but was nevertheless recognized and respected as Emperor Mingyuan&#x27;s wife, Consort Yao.
*Qifu Chipan, Prince Wenzhao of Western Qin, married his daughter, Princess Xingping (兴平公主), to Juqu Mengxun, Prince of Northern Liang&#x27;s son Juqu Xingguo.
*433: Juqu Mengxun, Prince of Northern Liang, marries his daughter, Princess Xingping (兴平公主), to Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei. She became Emperor Taiwu&#x27;s concubine.

==Northern and Southern dynasties==
During the Northern and Southern dynasties period, China was divided into many rival states. A complicated system of rivalries and vassalage existed. &quot;Heqin&quot; marriage was employed as a method to maintain a balance of power or to solidify alliances between states.

During the Northern and Southern dynasties, there were five instances of &quot;heqin&quot; marriage.
*428: Emperor Mingyuan of Northern Wei marries his daughter, Princess Shiping (始平公主), to Helian Chang, Emperor of Xia.

*Princess Qianjin (千金公主), daughter of Yuwen Zhao, Prince of Zhao (赵王宇文招) and a member of the imperial family of Northern Zhou, married Ishbara, Khagan of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate.
*582: Emperor Ming of Western Liang marries his daughter, Princess Xiao, to Yang Guang, Prince of Jin, the second son Emperor Ming&#x27;s overlord, Emperor Wen of Sui. She is known as Empress Xiao of Sui after his accession to the throne as Emperor Yang of Sui.

===Northern Wei===
The Tuoba imperial family of the Xianbei-led Northern Wei dynasty started to arrange for ethnic Han elites to marry daughters of the imperial family in the 480s. More than fifty percent of Tuoba Xianbei princesses of the Northern Wei were married to southern Han men from the imperial families and aristocrats from southern China of the Southern dynasties who defected and moved north to join the Northern Wei. Some exiled royalty of Han descent fled from southern China and defected to the Northern Wei. Several daughters of the Xianbei Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei were married to ethnic Han elites, the Liu Song royal Liu Hui 刘辉, married Princess Lanling 蘭陵公主 of the Northern Wei, Princess Huayang 華陽公主 to Sima Fei 司馬朏, a descendant of Jin dynasty (266–420) royalty, Princess Jinan 濟南公主 to Lu Daoqian 盧道虔, Princess Nanyang 南阳长公主 to Xiao Baoyin 萧宝夤, a member of Southern Qi royalty. Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei&#x27;s sisters, the Shouyang Princess was wedded to the Liang dynasty ruler Emperor Wu of Liang&#x27;s son Xiao Zong . One of Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei&#x27;s sister was married to Zhang Huan, an ethnic Han, according to the Book of Zhou. His name is given as Zhang Xin in the Book of Northern Qi and History of the Northern Dynasties which mention his marriage to a Xianbei princess of Wei. His personal name was changed due to a naming taboo on the emperor&#x27;s name. He was the son of Zhang Qiong.

When the Eastern Jin dynasty ended Northern Wei received the Jin prince Sima Chuzhi () as a refugee. A Northern Wei Princess married Sima Chuzhi, giving birth to Sima Jinlong. Northern Liang Lushuihu King Juqu Mujian&#x27;s daughter married Sima Jinlong.

===Rouran===
The Rouran Khaganate arranged for one of their princesses, Khagan Yujiulü Anagui&#x27;s daughter Princess Ruru 蠕蠕公主 to be married to the ethnic Han regent Gao Huan of the Eastern Wei.

==Gaochang==
The Kingdom of Gaochang was made out of ethnic Han colonists and ruled by the Han people Qu family, which originated from Gansu. Jincheng commandery (金城 in Lanzhou), district of Yuzhong (榆中) was the home of the Qu Jia. The Qu family was linked by marriage alliances to the Turks, with a Turk being the grandmother of King Qu Boya&#x27;s.

==Sui dynasty==
With the establishment of the Sui dynasty in 581, much of China proper was once again unified under one dynasty. &quot;Heqin&quot; marriage during the Sui dynasty therefore returned to its original purpose of trying to appease barbarian tribes surrounding the Sui. There were a total of seven instances of &quot;heqin&quot; marriage during the Sui dynasty.
*597: Emperor Wen of Sui marries Princess Anyi (安义公主), a Sui &quot;princess&quot;, to Yami Qaghan, Khagan of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate. She was assassinated by Yung Yu- lu in 599
*599: Emperor Wen of Sui marries another Sui princess, Princess Yicheng (义成公主), the daughter of a Sui imperial clansman, to Yami, Khagan of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate. After his death in 609, Princess Yicheng, in accordance with the Göktürk custom of levirate marriage, remarried to Yami Qaghan&#x27;s successor and son (by another wife), Shibi Qaghan. After Shibi Qaghan&#x27;s death in 619, Princess Yicheng again remarried to Shibi Qaghan&#x27;s successor and younger brother, Chuluo. After the khagan&#x27;s death in 621, Princess Yicheng remarried for the fourth and final time to his successor and younger brother, Illig Qaghan, who revolted against Tang China and was captured and killed in 630
*Emperor Yang of Sui married Princess Xinyi (信义公主), a Sui &quot;princess&quot;, to Heshana Khan, Khagan of the Western Turkish Khaganate.

*Emperor Yang of Sui married a Sui &quot;princess&quot; to Qu Boya, ruler of the oasis city of Gaochang in the Taklamakan Desert.

==Tang dynasty==
During the Tang dynasty, &quot;heqin&quot; marriage alliances were primarily aimed at the Tuyuhun, the Tibetan Empire, the Khitans and the allied Kumo Xi, the Uyghur Khaganate, and Nanzhao.

There were a total of twenty-one instances of &quot;heqin&quot; marriage alliances during the Tang dynasty, including:

==Liao, Song, Jin dynasties==

=== Song dynasty ===
The Khitan-led Liao dynasty asked for a Song princess to marry the Liao emperor in the negotiations leading up to the Chanyuan Treaty but the Song dynasty refused to give a princess. The Jurchen-led Jin dynasty later rebelled against the Liao dynasty, sacked and destroyed the Liao supreme capital and burned the ancestral tombs of the Liao emperors. The Emperor Tianzuo of Liao was executed by the Jurchens during a polo match. Liao imperial princesses from the Yelü family and Xiao family were also distributed to Jin princes as concubine. Wanyan Liang married the Khitan women Lady Xiao (蕭氏), Consort Chen (宸妃), Lady Yelü (耶律氏), Consort Li (麗妃), Lady Yelü (耶律氏), Consort Rou (柔妃) and Lady Yelü (耶律氏), Zhaoyuan (昭媛).

The Jin dynasty then attacked the Northern Song dynasty in the Jingkang incident and seized a large number of the Song imperial family. Song princesses were married off to Jin princes such as Emperor Xizong of Jin. The Song male princes who were captured were given ethnic Khitan women to marry from the Liao dynasty palace by the Jin, who had also defeated and conquered the Liao. The original Han wives of the Song princes were confiscated and replaced with Khitan ones. One of the Emperor Huizong of Song&#x27;s sons was given a Khitan consort from the Liao palace, and another one of his sons was given a Khitan princess by the Jin at the Jin supreme capital. The Jurchens continued to give new wives to the captured Song royals, the grandsons and sons of the Emperor Huizong of Song after they took away their original ethnic Han wives. The Jin told the Song royals that they were fortunate because the Liao royals were being treated much worse by the Jin than the Song royals, Jin soldiers were given the children of the Emperor Tianzuo of Liao as gifts while the Song emperor was allowed to keep his children while he was in captivity.

===Liao dynasty===
The Liao dynasty arranged for women from the consort Xiao clan to marry members of the Han 韓 clan of ethnic Han descent, which originated in Jizhou 冀州 before being abducted by the Liao and becoming part of the ethnic Han elites of the Liao.

The Geng family of Han descent intermarried with the Khitans and the Han 韓 clan provided two of their women as wives to Geng Yanyi and the second one was the mother of Geng Zhixin. Empress Rende&#x27;s sister, a member of the Xiao clan, was the mother of Han Chinese General Geng Yanyi.

Han Derang (Yelü Longyun) was the father of Queen dowager of the State of Chen, who was the wife of General Geng Yanyi and buried with him in his tomb in Zhaoyang in Liaoning. His wife was also known as &quot;Madame Han&quot;. The Geng&#x27;s tomb is located in Liaoning at Guyingzi in Chaoying.

===Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom===
The Cao family of ethnic Han descent that ruled the Guiyi Circuit established marriage alliances with the Uighurs of the Ganzhou Kingdom, with both the Cao rulers marrying Uighur princesses and with Cao princesses marrying Uighur rulers. The Ganzhou Uighur Khagan&#x27;s daughter was married to Cao Yijin in 916.

==Yuan dynasty==
The Jin emperor Wanyan Yongji&#x27;s daughter Princess Qiguo was married to Genghis Khan in exchange for relieving the Mongol siege upon Zhongdu (Beijing) in the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty.

The Emperor Gong of Song surrendered to the Yuan dynasty in 1276 and was married off to an ethnic Mongol princess of the imperial Borjigin family of the Yuan dynasty. Zhao Xian had one son with the Borjigin woman, Zhao Wanpu. Zhao Xian&#x27;s son Zhao Wanpu was kept alive by the Yuan because of his mother&#x27;s Borjigin ancestry even after Zhao Xian was ordered killed by the Emperor Yingzong of Yuan. Instead Zhao Wanpu was only moved and exiled. The outbreak of the Song loyalist Red Turban Rebellion in Henan led to a recommendation that Zhao Wanpu should be transferred somewhere else by an Imperial Censor in 1352. The Yuan did not want the ethnic Han rebels to get their hands on Zhao Wanpu so no one was permitted to see him and Zhao Wanpu&#x27;s family and himself were exiled to Shazhou near the border by the Yuan emperor. Paul Pelliot and John Andrew Boyle commented on Rashid-al-Din Hamadani&#x27;s chapter &quot;The Successors of Genghis Khan&quot; in his work &quot;Jami&#x27; al-tawarikh&quot;, identified references by Rashid al-Din to Zhao Xian in his book where he mentions a Chinese ruler who was an &quot;emir&quot; and son-in-law to the Qan (Khan) after being removed from his throne by the Mongols and he is also called &quot;Monarch of Song&quot;, or &quot;Suju&quot; (宋主; Songzhu) in the book.

The King of Dali Duan Gong was married to the Borjigin princess Agai, daughter of the Yuan dynasty Prince of Liang, Basalawarmi. They had a son and a daughter, Duan Sengnu. their children were also called Duan Qiangna and Duan Bao. Duan Sengnu raised Duan Bao to take revenge against Basalawarmi for the killing of Duan Gong. A play was made based on these events. According to Yuan documents, the Duan family were originally ethnic Han from Wuwei commandery, Gansu. Other Duan families also originated from Wuwei.

==Ming dynasty==
The Oirat leader Esen Taishi captured the Zhengtong Emperor of the Ming dynasty. Esen Taishi tried to force the Zhengtong Emperor to marry Esen&#x27;s sister in a &quot;heqin&quot; marriage and then placing him back in Beijing with his new wife. The emperor rejected the marriage proposal.

A Mongol account in the &quot;Altan Tobchi&quot; said that Zhengtong Emperor had a son with an ethnic Mongol woman he married while he was prisoner.

A Mongol girl was given in marriage by the Gün-bilig-mergen Mongol Ordos leader Rinong (Jinong) to the ethnic Han officer of the Datong Army Wang Duo&#x27;s (王鐸) son Wang San (王三) because Rinong wanted to hold on to Wang San and make him stay with the Mongols. The Ming arrested and executed Wang San in 1544 because Mongol soldiers were being guided by Wang San. Builders, carpenters, officers, and important prisoners such as the Ming Zhengtong Emperor often ethnic received Mongol wives.

==Qing dynasty==
In the total span of the Qing dynasty, the number of ethnic Mongol grooms of Qing princesses was the largest. More than 58 percent of imperial sons-in-law were Mongols. A total of 32 princesses married Mongols but the majority of these were in the early Qing like Emperor Hong Taiji who married off 12 of his daughters to ethnic Mongol elites, when the Qing needed military support. In the early period of Qing, a large amount of intermarriage between the two groups happened, and the Qing rulers used this tie to gain the military support from the Mongol tribes. The marriage also benefited the Qing dynasty in expanding its empire into the Mongolian Plateau and further west into Inner Asia. The marriage between ethnic Manchu princesses and ethnic Mongol princes continued to the end of Qing dynasty, although becoming less prominent after the 18th century due to the decline of the Mongols&#x27; political and military influence within the empire and the Qing after 1770 totally ceased marrying princesses off to Northern and Western Mongols, only marrying them off to princes from the southern Mongols who voluntarily surrendered to them before the establishment of the Qing, who numbered 7 tribes and 13 banners since the locations they inhabited were vital to Qing security unlike the steppes of the Northern and Western Mongols since the wars between the Zunghars and Khalkhas was over. During the Qianlong reign in 1751 and Jiaqing reign in 1801, the Qing emperors deliberately issued decrees eliminating Mongols from potential grooms of Qing princesses and started replacing them with majority Manchu grooms. The Qing at this time no longer needed the support of Mongols and started marrying off their daughters to majority Manchu grooms instead of Mongols.

Ethnic Han generals who defected to the Qing early on were sometimes married to Qing princesses due to the desperate need of the Qing for military allies at that time and their use of marrying their women off to get them, although this is less frequent than the case where Aisin Gioro women married to ethnic Mongol aristocrats or other Manchu elites. Unlike the marriage between Manchus and southern Mongols that lasted throughout the Qing dynasty, the marriages between Qing princesses and ethnic Han generals ceased before 1750 as Qing rule was consolidated by then.

The Manchu imperial Aisin Gioro clan practiced marriage alliances with Ming generals of Han descent and Mongol princes. Aisin Gioro women were married to ethnic Han generals who defected to the Qing side during the Transition from Ming to Qing. The Later Jin leader Nurhaci married one of his granddaughters, a daughter of Abatai, to the Ming general Li Yongfang, the ancestor of Li Shiyao (). The offspring of Li received the &quot;Third Class Viscount&quot; () title after he surrendered Fushun in Liaoning to the Manchu in 1618. A mass marriage of Han officers and officials to Manchu women numbering 1,000 couples was arranged by Prince Yoto (Prince Keqin) and Hong Taiji in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups. Aisin Gioro women were married to the sons of the Han generals Sun Sike (), Geng Jimao, Shang Kexi, and Wu Sangui.

The &quot;Dolo efu&quot; 和碩額駙 rank was given to husbands of Qing princesses. Geng Zhongming, a Han bannerman, was awarded the title of Prince Jingnan, and his son Geng Jingmao managed to have both his sons Geng Jingzhong and Geng Zhaozhong 耿昭忠 become court attendants under the Shunzhi Emperor and marry Aisin Gioro women, with Prince Abatai&#x27;s granddaughter marrying Geng Zhaozhong 耿昭忠 and Haoge&#x27;s (a son of Hong Taiji) daughter marrying Geng Jingzhong. A daughter of the Manchu Aisin Gioro Prince Yolo (Prince An) was wedded to Geng Juzhong who was another son of Geng Jingmao.

The 4th daughter of Kangxi () was wedded to the son () of Sun Sike (), an ethnic Han.

Imperial Duke Who Assists the State (宗室輔國公) Aisin Gioro Suyan&#x27;s (蘇燕) daughter was married to Han Banner general Nian Gengyao. She was Manchu Prince Ajige&#x27;s great-great-granddaughter.

Manchu Prince Aisin Gioro Yuntang&#x27;s fourth daughter married the Han Bannerman Zhao Shiyang (趙世揚) in 1721. Manchu Prince Aisin Gioro Yunsi&#x27;s first daughter married the Han Bannerman Sun Wufu (孫五福) in July/August 1724. Manchu Prince Aisin Gioro Yunzhi, Prince Zhi&#x27;s second daughter married the Han Bannerman Li Shu&#x27;ao (李淑鰲) in September/October 1707 and his fourth daughter married the Han Bannerman Sun Cheng&#x27;en (孫承恩) in February/March 1710.

== Vietnam ==
The Lý, Trần, Hồ dynasties ruled Dai Viet (Vietnam) in a succession of heqin alliances.

=== Lý, Trần, Hồ dynasties ===
The Lý dynasty married its princesses off to chieftains of the local clans in the northern mountains and regional rivals to establish alliances with them. The Lý family married one of their princesses (Lý Chiêu Hoàng) to a member of the Trần (Chen 陈) clan, Trần Thái Tông. This then enabled the Trần to topple the Lý and establish their own Trần dynasty.

The Tran dynasty engaged in a similar practice, marrying Tran princesses to regional allies. Later, the Hồ family, which was also of Chinese origin, established the Hồ dynasty, taking power after having a Tran princess marry one of their members, Hồ Quý Ly. A Lý princess also married into the Ho family.

===Nguyen lords===
The Cambodian King Chey Chettha II married the Vietnamese Nguyễn lord Princess Nguyễn Thị Ngọc Vạn, a daughter of Lord Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên, in 1618. In return, the king granted the Vietnamese the right to establish settlements in Mô Xoài (now Bà Rịa), in the region of Prey Nokor—which they colloquially referred to as &quot;Sài Gòn&quot;, and which later became Ho Chi Minh City.

==Joseon==
After the Qing invasion of Joseon, Joseon Korea was forced to give several of their princesses as concubines to the Qing Prince Regent Dorgon, an ethnic Manchu. In 1650, Dorgon married Princess Uisun (義順). She came from a collateral branch of the royal family, and was the daughter of Yi Gae-yun (李愷胤). Dorgon is said to have married two Korean princesses at Lianshan.

<text>Vera Florence Cooper Rubin (; July 23, 1928 – December 25, 2016) was an American astronomer who pioneered work on galaxy rotation rates. She uncovered the discrepancy between the predicted and observed angular motion of galaxies by studying galactic rotation curves. These results were later confirmed over subsequent decades. Her work on the galaxy rotation problem was cited by others as evidence for the existence of dark matter. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile is named in her honor. 

Beginning her academic career as the sole undergraduate in astronomy at Vassar College, Rubin went on to graduate studies at Cornell University and Georgetown University, where she observed deviations from Hubble flow in galaxies and provided evidence for the existence of galactic superclusters. She was honored throughout her career for her work, receiving the Bruce Medal, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, and the National Medal of Science, among others.

Rubin spent her life advocating for women in science, and she was known for her mentorship of aspiring female astronomers. Her legacy was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;ushering in a Copernican-scale change&quot; in cosmological theory.

== Early life ==
Vera Cooper was born on July 23, 1928, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was the younger of two sisters. Her parents were Philip Cooper, an electrical engineer at Bell Telephone and Rose Cooper who worked at Bell Telephone until they married.
The Coopers moved to Washington, D.C., in 1938, where ten-year-old Vera developed an interest in astronomy while watching the stars from her window. &quot;Even then I was more interested in the question than in the answer,&quot; she remembered. &quot;I decided at an early age that we inhabit a very curious world.&quot; She built a crude telescope out of cardboard with her father, and began to observe and track meteors. She attended Coolidge Senior High School, graduating in 1944.

Rubin&#x27;s older sister, Ruth Cooper Burg, was an attorney who later worked as an administrative law judge in the United States Department of Defense.

== Education ==
Rubin was inspired to pursue an undergraduate education at Vassar College (then an all-women&#x27;s school), and she was also inspired by Maria Mitchell, who had been a professor in that same college in 1865. She ignored advice she had received from a high school science teacher to avoid a scientific career and become an artist. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa and earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree in astronomy in 1948, the only graduate in astronomy that year. She attempted to enroll in a graduate program at Princeton, but was barred due to her gender. Princeton would not accept women as astronomy graduate students for 27 more years. Rubin also turned down an offer from Harvard University.

She married in 1948, and her husband, Robert Joshua Rubin, was a graduate student at Cornell University.

Rubin then enrolled at Cornell University, and earned a master&#x27;s degree in 1951. During her graduate studies, she studied the motions of 109 galaxies and made one of the first observations of deviations from Hubble flow (how the galaxies move apart from one another). She worked with astronomer Martha Carpenter on galactic dynamics, and studied under Philip Morrison, Hans Bethe, and Richard Feynman. Though the conclusion she came to – that there was an orbital motion of galaxies around a particular pole – was disproven, the idea that galaxies were moving held true and sparked further research. Her research also provided early evidence of the supergalactic plane. This information and the data she discovered was immensely controversial. She struggled to be allowed to present her work at the American Astronomical Society as she was visibly pregnant and not a member of the society, the talk received - to her recollection - universally negative feedback and the paper was not published.

Rubin studied for her Ph.D. at Georgetown University, the only university in Washington, D.C., that offered a graduate degree in astronomy.

She was 23 years old and pregnant when she began her doctoral studies, and the Rubins had one young child at home. She began to take classes with Francis Heyden, who recommended her to George Gamow of the neighboring George Washington University, her eventual doctoral advisor. Her dissertation, completed in 1954, concluded that galaxies clumped together, rather than being randomly distributed through the universe, a controversial idea not pursued by others for two decades. Throughout her graduate studies, she encountered discouraging sexism; in one incident she was not allowed to meet with her advisor in his office, because women were not allowed in that area of the Catholic university.

== Career ==
For the next eleven years, Rubin held various academic positions. She served for a year as an instructor of Mathematics and Physics at Montgomery College. From 1955 to 1965 she worked at Georgetown University as a research associate astronomer, lecturer (1959–1962), and finally, assistant professor of astronomy (1962–1965). She joined the Carnegie Institution of Washington (later called Carnegie Institution of Science) in 1965 as a staff member in the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. There she met her long-time collaborator, instrument-maker Kent Ford. Because she had young children, she did much of her work from home.

In 1963, Rubin began a year-long collaboration with Geoffrey and Margaret Burbidge, during which she made her first observations of the rotation of galaxies while using the McDonald Observatory&#x27;s 82-inch telescope. During her work at the Carnegie Institution, Rubin applied to observe at the Palomar Observatory in 1965, despite the fact that the building did not have facilities for women. She created her own women&#x27;s restroom, sidestepping the lack of facilities available for her. She became the first female astronomer to observe there.

At the Carnegie Institution, Rubin began work related to her controversial thesis regarding galaxy clusters with Ford, making hundreds of observations using Ford&#x27;s image-tube spectrograph. This image intensifier allowed resolving the spectra of astronomical objects that were previously too dim for spectral analysis. The Rubin–Ford effect, an apparent anisotropy in the expansion of the Universe on the scale of 100 million light years, was discovered through studies of spiral galaxies, particularly the Andromeda Galaxy, chosen for its brightness and proximity to Earth. The idea of peculiar motion on this scale in the universe was a highly controversial proposition, which was first published in journals in 1976. It was dismissed by leading astronomers but ultimately shown to be valid. The effect is now known as large scale streaming. The pair also briefly studied quasars, which had been discovered in 1963 and were a popular topic of research.

Wishing to avoid controversial areas of astronomy, including quasars and galactic motion, Rubin began to study the rotation and outer reaches of galaxies, an interest sparked by her collaboration with the Burbidges. She investigated the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, again beginning with Andromeda, by looking at their outermost material. She observed flat rotation curves: the outermost components of the galaxy were moving as quickly as those close to the center. She further uncovered the discrepancy between the predicted angular motion of galaxies based on the visible light and the observed motion. Her research showed that spiral galaxies rotate quickly enough that they should fly apart, if the gravity of their constituent stars was all that was holding them together; because they stay intact, a large amount of unseen mass must be holding them together, a conundrum that became known as the galaxy rotation problem.

Rubin&#x27;s results came to be cited as evidence that spiral galaxies were surrounded by dark matter haloes. 
Rubin&#x27;s calculations showed that galaxies must contain at least five to ten times more mass than can be observed directly based on the light emitted by ordinary matter. Rubin&#x27;s results were confirmed over subsequent decades, and became the first persuasive results supporting the theory of dark matter, initially proposed by Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s. This data was confirmed by radio astronomers, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background, and images of gravitational lensing. However, Rubin did not rule out alternative models to dark matter also inspired by her measurements. She and her research were discussed in the 1991 PBS series, &quot;The Astronomers&quot;. 

Another area of interest for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved in the opposite direction to the rotation of the rest of the galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.

Rubin&#x27;s perspective on the history of the work on galaxy movements was presented in a review, &quot;One Hundred Years of Rotating Galaxies,&quot; for the &quot;Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific&quot; in 2000. This was an adaptation of the lecture she gave in 1996 upon receiving the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, the second woman to be so honored, 168 years after Caroline Herschel received the Medal in 1828.
In 2002, &quot;Discover&quot; magazine recognized Rubin as one of the 50 most important women in science. She continued her research and mentorship until her death in 2016.

=== Vera C. Rubin Observatory === 

On December 20, 2019, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope was renamed the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in recognition of Rubin&#x27;s contributions to the study of dark matter and her outspoken advocacy for the equal treatment and representation of women in science. The observatory is located a mountain in Cerro Pachón, Chile and observations will focus on the study of dark matter and dark energy. As of 2024, the extremely agile telescope is in place and full operation is expected within the next year

== Legacy ==

When Rubin was elected to the National Academy of Science, she became the second woman astronomer in its ranks, after her colleague Margaret Burbidge. Rubin never won the Nobel Prize, though physicists such as Lisa Randall and Emily Levesque have argued that this was an oversight. She was described by Sandra Faber and Neta Bahcall as one of the astronomers who paved the way for other women in the field, as a &quot;guiding light&quot; for those who wished to have families and careers in astronomy. Rebecca Oppenheimer also recalled Rubin&#x27;s mentorship as important to her early career.

Rubin died on the night of December 25, 2016, of complications associated with dementia. The president of the Carnegie Institution, where she performed the bulk of her work and research, called her a &quot;national treasure.&quot;

The Carnegie Institution has created a postdoctoral research fund in Rubin&#x27;s honor, and the Division on Dynamical Astronomy of the American Astronomical Society has named the Vera Rubin Early Career Prize in her honor.

Rubin was featured in an animated segment of the 13th and final episode of &quot;&quot;. An area on Mars, Vera Rubin Ridge, is named after her and Asteroid 5726 Rubin was named in her honor.

On 6 November 2020, a satellite named after her (ÑuSat 18 or &quot;Vera&quot;, COSPAR 2020-079K) was launched into space.

Rubin will be honored on a U.S. quarter in 2025 as part of the final year of the American Women quarters program.

On June 2, 2024, Nvidia announced that their next generation of data center accelerators would be named after her, with the CPU named Vera and GPU named Rubin.
=== In media ===
The Verubin Nebula which appears in Season Three of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; is named after Rubin.

&quot;The Stuff Between the Stars: How Vera Rubin Discovered Most of the Universe&quot; is a children&#x27;s book by Sandra Nickel and Aimee Sicuro.

== Personal life ==
Vera Cooper Rubin was married to Robert Joshua Rubin from 1948 until his death in 2008. She had children while undertaking her graduate studies at Cornell, and she continued to work on her research while raising their young children. All four of their children earned PhDs in the natural sciences or mathematics: David (born 1950), is a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey; Judith Young (1952–2014), was an astronomer at the University of Massachusetts; Karl (born 1956), is a mathematician at the University of California at Irvine; and Allan (born 1960), is a geologist at Princeton University. Rubin&#x27;s children recalled later in life that their mother made a life of science appear desirable and fun, which inspired them to become scientists themselves.

Motivated by her own battle to gain credibility as a woman in a field that was dominated by male astronomers, Rubin encouraged girls interested in investigating the universe to pursue their dreams. Throughout her life, she faced discouraging comments on her choice of study but persevered, as she was supported by family and colleagues. In addition to encouraging women in astronomy, Rubin was a force for greater recognition of women in the sciences and for scientific literacy.

She, alongside Burbidge, advocated for more women to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), selected for review panels, and represented in academic searches. She said that despite her struggles with the NAS, she continued to be dissatisfied with the low number of women who were elected each year, and she further said it was &quot;the saddest part of [her] life&quot;.

Rubin was Jewish, and she shared that she saw no conflict between science and religion. In an interview, she said: &quot;In my own life, my science and my religion are separate. I&#x27;m Jewish, and so religion to me is a kind of moral code and a kind of history. I try to do my science in a moral way, and, I believe that, ideally, science should be looked upon as something that helps us understand our role in the universe.&quot;

<text>HMS &quot;Hostile&quot; (H55) was an H-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the 1930s. She was the first and so far only Royal Navy ship to bear the name &quot;Hostile&quot;. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. She was transferred to Freetown, Sierra Leone, in October 1939 to hunt for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic with Force K. &quot;Hostile&quot; participated in the First Battle of Narvik in April 1940 and the Battle of Calabria in July 1940. The ship was damaged by a mine off Cape Bon in the Strait of Sicily while on passage from Malta to Gibraltar on 23 August 1940. She was then scuttled by .

==Description==
&quot;Hostile&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. &quot;Hostile&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime.

The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft defence &quot;Hostile&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.

==Service==
&quot;Hostile&quot; was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company at Greenock, Scotland, on 27 February 1935, launched on 24 January 1936, and completed on 10 September 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £253,382. She was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. &quot;Hostile&quot; patrolled Spanish waters in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the edicts of the Non-Intervention Committee. The ship received an overhaul at Gibraltar between 17 November and 15 December 1937. She resumed patrolling Spanish waters in 1938 and 1939. After the end of the Spanish Civil War, &quot;Hostile&quot; was refitted in Sheerness Dockyard between 31 May and 26 July 1939. She returned to the Mediterranean and was in Malta when World War II began.

In October the ship was transferred to Freetown to hunt for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic with Force K. The ship and her half-sisters, , , and , rendezvoused with the battlecruiser , the aircraft carrier , and the light cruiser on 17 December. They refuelled in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before proceeding to the estuary of the River Plate in case the damaged German pocket battleship attempted to escape from Montevideo, Uruguay, where she had taken refuge after losing the Battle of the River Plate. &quot;Hostile&quot; was overhauled at Chatham Dockyard between 26 January and 29 March 1940 and then rejoined the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, now assigned to the Home Fleet. On 7 April, &quot;Hostile&quot; captured the German fishing trawler off the Lofoten Islands (). During the First Battle of Narvik on 10 April the ship torpedoed merchant ships moored there (eleven German and collaterally one British, two Norwegian and two Swedish). and engaged the and badly damaged her, hitting her at least five times. &quot;Hostile&quot; was only hit once, but the shell did little damage. She escorted her badly damaged sister ship, , to the repair base set up at Flakstadøya in the Lofoten Islands. &quot;Hostile&quot; briefly escorted the battleship before she returned to Rosyth for repairs between 27 April and 4 May. The ship briefly returned to Norwegian waters, where she again escorted &quot;Warspite&quot;, before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in mid-May.

On 9 July &quot;Hostile&quot; participated in the Battle of Calabria as an escort for the heavy ships of Force C and unsuccessfully engaged Italian destroyers, suffering no damage. The ship, together with her sister, , and the destroyers and , were ordered to Gibraltar on 22 August where they were to temporarily join Force H. &quot;Hostile&quot; struck an Italian mine en route on the early morning of 23 August off Cap Bon that broke her back. The explosion killed five men and wounded three others. &quot;Mohawk&quot; took off the survivors while &quot;Hero&quot; fired two torpedoes to scuttle her.

<text>HMS &quot;Glowworm&quot; was a G-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War the ship spent part of 1936 and 1937 in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. &quot;Glowworm&quot; was transferred from the Mediterranean Fleet shortly after the beginning of Second World War to the British Isles, to escort shipping in local waters.

In March 1940, she was transferred to the Home Fleet and participated in the opening stages of the Norwegian Campaign. On 8 April 1940 &quot;Glowworm&quot; encountered German destroyers transporting troops to invade Norway in Operation Weserübung. The German destroyers tried to disengage and called for help from the heavy cruiser . In the battle, &quot;Glowworm&quot;, severely damaged, rammed &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;, losing its bow and sinking shortly afterwards.

 (Captain) Hellmuth Heye, the commander of &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;, recommended that the captain of &quot;Glowworm&quot; be awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. There were only two other occasions when a VC was awarded at the recommendation of the opponent in the Second World War.

==Description==
&quot;Glowworm&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of .

For anti-aircraft defence &quot;Glowworm&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was the test ship for the new quintuple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.

==Operational history==

===Early career===
&quot;Glowworm&quot; was ordered from the yards of John I. Thornycroft and Company, at Woolston, Hampshire on 5 March 1934 under the 1933 Construction Programme. She was laid down on 15 August 1934 and launched on 22 July 1935. She was completed on 22 January 1936 at a total cost of £248,785, excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament. Upon commissioning she was assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet. Between 10 August and 9 September 1936, together with , she escorted the yacht &quot;Nahlin&quot; as King Edward VIII cruised the eastern Mediterranean. 

&quot;Glowworm&quot; patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War, enforcing the edicts of the Non-Intervention Committee until she had a refit at Portsmouth between 27 May and 8 June 1937. The ship returned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean after her brief refit. &quot;Glowworm&quot; returned to Portsmouth for a longer overhaul between 7 June and 25 July 1938 and escorted the ocean liner SS &quot;Strathnaver&quot; between Malta and Alexandria during the Munich Crisis in September 1938. She then escorted the light cruiser on her voyage to Aden later that month. During night exercises on 16 May 1939, &quot;Glowworm&quot; collided with her sister, and was forced to put into Alexandria for temporary repairs. She received permanent repairs in Malta between 23 May and 24 June.

&quot;Glowworm&quot; was in Alexandria when the Second World War began in September 1939. In October the flotilla was transferred to the Western Approaches Command and &quot;Glowworm&quot; sailed for the UK on 19 October with her sisters , &quot;Grafton&quot;, and . They arrived at Plymouth on 22 October and were deployed in the South Western Approaches. &quot;Glowworm&quot; carried out convoy escort duties and anti-submarine patrols until 12 November when she was transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla, based at Harwich, for North Sea patrol and escort duties. On 22 February 1940 she was hit by the Swedish ship &quot;Rex&quot; in fog whilst at anchor off Outer Dowsing. &quot;Glowworm&quot; suffered significant structural damage and was under repair at a commercial dockyard in Hull until late March. On completion of the repairs, she was transferred back to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, rejoining the flotilla at its base at Scapa Flow on 20 March.

On 5 April &quot;Glowworm&quot; was part of the escort of the battlecruiser , along with her sisters &quot;Greyhound&quot;, , and . The ships covered the mine laying operation in Norwegian waters, Operation Wilfred. On 7 April, &quot;Glowworm&quot; was detached from the task force to search for a man lost overboard.

===&quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;===

On the morning of 8 April 1940 &quot;Glowworm&quot; was on her way to rejoin &quot;Renown&quot; when she encountered the German destroyers and in the thick fog before 8:00 a.m. The destroyers were part of a German naval detachment, led by the heavy cruiser , on its way to land troops at Trondheim as part of Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Norway. &quot;Glowworm&quot; opened fire and the German destroyers attempted to disengage, signalling for help. The request was soon answered by &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; and &quot;Glowworm&quot; was spotted at 09:50. &quot;Hipper&quot; had difficulty in distinguishing &quot;Glowworm&quot; from &quot;von Arnim&quot; but opened fire eight minutes later at a range of with the main armament.

&quot;Glowworm&quot; was hit by &quot;Hipper&quot;″s fourth salvo and she made smoke and turned into it but the cruiser&#x27;s radar-directed guns were not affected by the smoke. When the destroyer emerged from the smoke the range was short enough for the cruiser&#x27;s guns to open fire. &quot;Glowworm&quot;″s radio room, bridge, and forward 4.7-inch gun were destroyed and she received more hits in the engine room, the captain&#x27;s day cabin and the mast. As the mast fell it caused a short circuit of the wiring and the ship&#x27;s siren turned on.
At 10:10, Lieutenant Commander Gerard Roope fired five torpedoes from one mounting at a range of . The torpedoes missed because Captain Hellmuth Heye had kept &quot;Hipper&quot;″s bow pointed at &quot;Glowworm&quot; to minimize the risk from torpedoes. The destroyer fell back through her smokescreen to buy time to get her second torpedo mount working but Heye followed &quot;Glowworm&quot; to finish her off before she could fire the rest of her torpedoes. The two ships were very close when &quot;Hipper&quot; emerged from the smoke and Roope ordered a hard turn to starboard to ram the cruiser. &quot;Hipper&quot; was slow to answer her helm and &quot;Glowworm&quot; struck the cruiser just the anchor.

The collision broke off &quot;Glowworm&quot;″s bow and the rest of the ship scraped along &quot;Hipper&quot;″s side, gouging several holes in its hull, destroying her forward starboard torpedo mounting and sailor was lost overboard by the collision. &quot;Hipper&quot; took on some of water before the leaks could be isolated but was not seriously damaged. &quot;Glowworm&quot; was on fire when she drifted clear and her boilers exploded at 10:24, taking 109 of her crew with her.

===Rescue===
&quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; hove to and began to rescue survivors. The German sailor was not found but forty British sailors were recovered, although at least six later died of their wounds. The senior surviving officer, Lieutenant Ramsay, told his rescuers that neither the helm nor the emergency steering was manned when the ships collided. German accounts only mention four torpedoes fired by &quot;Glowworm&quot; but British accounts say all ten were fired. This was confirmed by photographic evidence taken after the collision showing empty torpedo tubes. Roope drowned when he could no longer hang on to a rope whilst being pulled up the side of the cruiser.

==Victoria cross==
Roope posthumously was awarded the Victoria Cross, becoming the first VC recipient of the Second World War. The award was justified, in part, by the recommendation of Heye, who wrote to the British authorities via the Red Cross, stating the dauntless courage Roope had shown when engaging a much superior ship at short range. Ramsay was awarded the DSO; the awards were made after the end of the war.

<text>HMS &quot;Garland, also known by her Polish designationORP &quot;Garland, was a G-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. Shortly after World War II began, she was badly damaged by the premature explosion of her own depth charges and required over six months of repairs. Before these were completed, &quot;Garland&quot; was loaned to the Polish Navy in May 1940. The ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet afterwards and escorted convoys there before being assigned to the Western Approaches Command in September for escort duties. She escorted a convoy from Gibraltar to Malta during Operation Halberd in September 1941 and escorted Convoy PQ 16 from Iceland to Murmansk in May 1942. She was badly damaged by a near miss from a German bomber during that operation and required three months of repairs.

&quot;Garland&quot; was then assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force in the North Atlantic until December 1943, when she was transferred to Freetown, Sierra Leone, to escort convoys off West Africa. In April 1944, the ship was transferred to back to the Mediterranean Fleet where she escorted convoys. She sank one German submarine in September before returning to the UK for a lengthy refit that lasted until March 1945. &quot;Garland&quot; was then assigned to the Western Approaches Command, but carried emergency supplies to coastal towns in Belgium and the Netherlands immediately after the war ended in May. She was paid off and reclaimed from the Polish Navy in July 1946. In mid-November that same year, she was sold to the Royal Netherlands Navy for use as a school ship. &quot;Garland&quot; was refitted as an anti-submarine training ship in 1948 and renamed &quot;Marnix&quot; in 1950. Reclassified as a frigate in 1952, the ship was not decommissioned until 1964 and scrapped afterwards.

==Description==
&quot;Garland&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum boilers. &quot;Garland&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime, but in increased to 146 in wartime.

The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mk IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, &quot;Garland&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mk III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. By mid-1940, this had increased to 44 depth charges.

===Wartime modifications===
Most ships of &quot;Garland&quot;″s class had the rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun after the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, but it is not known exactly when this modification was made. By 1942, the ship&#x27;s short range AA armament had been augmented by two Oerlikon 20 mm cannons on her searchlight platform and another pair on the wings of the ship&#x27;s bridge. &#x27;Y&#x27; gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased. The .50-calibre machine gun mounts were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons later. The ship&#x27;s director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge were removed in exchange for a Type 271 target indication radar, after 1942, and &#x27;B&#x27; gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar was probably also fitted mid-way through the war. The ship also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast.

==History==

===HMS &quot;Garland&quot;, 1936–1940===
Ordered on 5 March 1934 from Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering, &quot;Garland&quot; was laid down at Govan, Scotland, on 22 August 1934. She was launched on 24 October 1935 and completed on 3 March 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £250,664. She was assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. &quot;Garland&quot; took part in the evacuation of British and foreign nationals from Barcelona and other Spanish coastal ports at the start of the Spanish Civil War, and patrolled Spanish waters during the war, enforcing the edicts of the Non-Intervention Committee in 1937 and 1938. The ship was overhauled at Sheerness between 24 May and 5 July 1937 and 31 May to 28 July 1938 during which her low-pressure turbines were repaired. &quot;Garland&quot; patrolled off Cyprus in July 1939.

When World War II began, the ship was en route to Alexandria from Aden and arrived there on 6 September. Whilst escorting a convoy to Malta, some of her depth charges detonated prematurely on 17 September and badly damaged the aft end of the ship. &quot;Garland&quot; had to be towed back to Alexandria where temporary repairs were made. She was towed to Malta for permanent repairs which lasted from 11 October to 8 May 1940. Shortly before the completion of the repairs, she was loaned to the Polish Navy on 3 May 1940, the anniversary of the 1791 Polish Constitution of 3 May.

===ORP &quot;Garland&quot;, 1940–1946===
After working up, the ship escorted a convoy to and from Greece in late June 1940. During Operation Hats, &quot;Garland&quot; was lightly damaged by Italian aircraft on 31 August whilst escorting a convoy to Malta. She was transferred to the Western Approaches Command in mid-September and was assigned to the 10th Escort Group. On 13 November, &quot;Garland&quot; was badly damaged by storm whilst escorting the battleship and required over a month to make repairs. Two men were lost overboard during the storm. In early January 1941, the ship was fitted with a new ASDIC system. She was transferred to the 14th Escort Group in April and was then briefly attached to the Home Fleet, escorting a tanker, during the Allied landing on Spitsbergen in July. Upon her return, &quot;Garland&quot; was assigned to Escort Group B3 for escort duties in the North Atlantic.

In late September, she joined the Polish-manned destroyer in Operation Halberd, escorting a large convoy to Malta. The two ships escorted the battleship back to Gibraltar after she had been torpedoed during the operation. &quot;Garland&quot; then rejoined Escort Group B3. The ship was refitted between 28 February and 5 May 1942 in Middlesbrough and was assigned to escort Convoy PQ 16 in late May after working up. On 27 May, a bomb was dropped by a Junkers Ju 88 bomber off the starboard side of the ship, that decimated the crews of &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; guns and the starboard Oerlikon and .50-calibre machine guns (22 killed and 37 wounded). The ship&#x27;s fire-control director and rangefinder were destroyed and she was ordered to proceed independently to Murmansk for temporary repairs. These took over a month to complete and &quot;Garland&quot; sailed on 4 July for Troon, as part of the escort for Convoy QP 13, for permanent repairs that were not completed until 21 September.

The ship rejoined Escort Group B3 until she began a lengthy refit in May 1943 that lasted until 8 September. &quot;Garland&quot; was assigned to the 8th Support Group after working up and escorted several small convoys transporting Allied troops to the Azores to build airbases after the Portuguese gave their consent in late September. From November to April 1944, the ship was based in Freetown to escort convoys between Freetown and Gibraltar. In May she was assigned to the 14th Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet where she escorted convoys and supported Allied operations in the Aegean. On 19 September 1944, together with two other British destroyers, she sank the off Santorini. The following month &quot;Garland&quot; supported the Allied liberation of Greece after the German withdrawal.

On 20 November, the ship sailed for the UK to begin a lengthy refit at Devonport that lasted until 31 March 1945. She was assigned to the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in the Western Approaches Command, but had barely finished working up when the war ended in May. The ship transported emergency supplies to Belgium and the Netherlands immediately afterwards. At the end of 1945, &quot;Garland&quot; took part in Operation Deadlight, the scuttling of captured German U-boats. In early 1946, the ship patrolled Norwegian waters and then was assigned to the Polish Squadron at Rosyth through June. In late July she was ordered to be paid off and the loan terminated. The ship was disarmed in late August before entering Category C reserve.

===HNLMS &quot;Marnix&quot;, 1946–1964===
On 14 November 1946, &quot;Garland&quot; was sold &quot;as is&quot; to the Royal Netherlands Navy for £9,000 and was initially used as a school ship. She was refurbished in 1948 as an anti-submarine training ship. This is probably when &quot;Garland&quot; was rearmed with two anti-aircraft guns in &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; positions, a Hedgehog in &#x27;B&#x27; position and six 20-millimetre Oerlikons. She carried four depth charge throwers and two depth charge rails. The ship was renamed HNLMS &quot;Marnix&quot; on 16 January 1950 and made port visits in southern British ports the following March. &quot;Marnix&quot; was reclassified as a frigate in 1952 and received a thorough overhaul in 1955–56. She was decommissioned on 31 January 1964 and later scrapped.

<doc id="472987" wikidata="Q83189" url="?curid=472987" title="Goiânia">
<text>Goiânia ( , ) is the capital and largest city of the Brazilian state of Goiás. With a population of 1,536,097, it is the second-largest city in the Central-West Region and the 10th-largest in the country. Its metropolitan area has a population of 2,890,418, making it the 12th-largest in Brazil. With an area of approximately , it has a continuous geography with few hills and lowlands, with flat lands in most of its territory, especially the Meia Ponte River, in addition to Botafogo and Capim Puba streams.

Goiânia has its origins as a planned city, founded on October 24, 1933, by then Governor Pedro Ludovico to serve as the new state capital and administrative center. Before this, the state capital was the town of Goiás.

It is the second most populous city in the Central-West Region, only surpassed by the country&#x27;s capital Brasília, located about from Goiânia. The city is an important economic hub of the region and is considered a strategic center for such areas as industry, medicine, fashion and agriculture. Goiânia has previously been described as having the largest green area per inhabitant in Brazil and the second-most in the world, after Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. With rapid population growth and urban expansion, satellite imagery shows the majority of the green area is now at the periphery of its sprawling city limits, and the per-capita green area claim may need to be reviewed.
==History==
The idea of creating a new state capital had been bounced around from early on in the state of Goiás. The first plan came from D. Marcos de Noronha who in 1753 wanted to establish the state capital in the municipality of Pirenópolis; again in 1863 José Vieira Couto de Magalhães put forward a plan to move the capital to the edge of the Araguaia river.

The impetus behind the efforts to move the state capital was the need to locate it in accordance with the economic interests of the state. The first state capital, Vila Boa (today City of Goiás), had been chosen when the economy was based on gold extraction. Later, when cattle-raising and agriculture came to dominate the state&#x27;s development, the old capital was considered remote.

Legislators kept the idea of change alive for a long time. In 1891, the constitutional delegates officially included the idea of transferring the capital in the constitution, which was ratified in 1898 and again in 1918.

Vaguely remembered until 1930, the idea became a reality during the government of Pedro Ludovico, who was the new governor appointed for the state of Goiás after the military revolt of 1930. In 1932, a commission was created to choose where the new capital would be built. The choice was the municipality of Campinas. The mayor at the time, Andrelino Rodrigues de Moraes, accepted the plan and donated about 242 acres of his land to build the new state capital. In 1933 the commission decided on the present location and the foundation stone was laid.

The plan was for a city of 50,000 with the shape of a concentric radius — streets in the form of a spoke, with the Praça Cívica as the center, with the seats of the state and municipal government — the Palace of Emeralds and the Palace of Campinas.

In 1937, a decree was signed transferring the state capital from the Cidade de Goiás to Goiânia. The official inauguration occurred in 1942 with the presence of the president of the republic, governors, and ministers.

The name, Goiânia, came about in 1933 after a contest was held by a local newspaper. Readers from all over the state contributed, with some of the most popular names being Petrônia, Americana, Petrolândia, Goianópolis, Goiânia, Bartolomeu Bueno, Campanha, Eldorado, Anhanguera, Liberdade, Goianésia, and Pátria Nova, among others. In 1935 Pedro Ludovico used the name Goiânia for the first time, signing a decree creating the municipality.

===Art deco===

The first buildings in this planned city, designed by Attilio Correia Lima, were inspired by art deco. The collection of buildings is still representative, with 22 of them listed as National Heritage. Mostly built in the 1940s and 1950s, they have been recognized by the National Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage. The 22 buildings and monuments are in the original center of Goiânia, as in the pioneering nucleus of Campinas, a town existing before Goiânia. Due to lack of maintenance, several of these buildings are in a state of disrepair.

===Radiation incident===

On September 13, 1987, a medical radiation source containing radioactive caesium-137 was stolen from an abandoned hospital in the city, causing four deaths and many non-fatal cases of radiation poisoning. The incident was catalyzed by the Caesium salt giving off Cherenkov radiation once exposed to open air. The soft bluish glow attracted many curious citizens who would take grains of the salt for themselves and family members in the form of jewelry. Those who had not taken any of the salt but were in close contact with it also helped the spread of radiation sickness that set in within hours to days of exposure. Several city blocks had to be demolished due to the contamination. The International Atomic Energy Agency report noted that city and state officials acted with remarkable speed to prevent further injury to the population. The former owner of the health clinic where the container was taken from was barred from retrieving some equipment from the building by court appointed guards. The owner then ominously warned that the guards would be responsible for what happened with &quot;the Caesium bomb&quot;, referring to the radiotherapy machine that would be responsible for the incident.

==Geography==
===Climate===
The city has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen: Aw) with an average temperature of . It has a wet season, from October to April, and a dry one, from May to September. Annual rainfall is around .

The lowest temperature ever recorded was on July 18, 2000, in the suburbs. was the lowest recorded downtown, on July 9, 1938. However, such lows are very rare. Temperatures may fall below every winter, mainly in the suburbs. The highest temperature ever recorded was on October 7, 2020.

===Flora and fauna===

The &quot;cerrado&quot; landscape is characterized by extensive savanna formations crossed by gallery forests and stream valleys and includes various types of vegetation. Humid fields and &quot;buriti&quot; palm paths are found where the water table is near the surface. Alpine pastures occur at higher altitudes and mesophytic forests on more fertile soils.

More than 1600 species of mammals, birds and reptiles have been identified in the cerrado, including 180 reptile species, 113 amphibians, 837 birds and 195 mammals (WWF). Among the invertebrates, the most notable are the termites and the leaf-cutter ants (&quot;saúvas&quot;). They are the main herbivores of the cerrado, important to consuming and decomposing of organic matter, as well as constituting an important food source to many other animal species.

==Economy==
While Goiânia&#x27;s economy today is based on a variety of industries, the local economy&#x27;s roots are found in the agricultural industry thriving in and around the city. The supply of agricultural equipment, tools, fertilizer and other products make up a large portion of the economic activity.

Second to agriculture are vehicle sales and service industry. Repairs, sales and reconditioning of vehicles are widespread and visible in all areas of the city.

The third largest contributor to the economy is the government sector. As Goiânia is the state capital of Goiás, it is home to many federal and state government agencies that provide a large number of jobs.

In recent years, modern telecommunications, with its supporting industry, has begun to expand into Goiânia. Many large Brazilian companies have established offices in the city.

In addition, due to Goiânia being the state capital, it is home to countless private medical centers/clinics of all kinds.

In 2005, the GDP of the city was R$13,354,065.00.

In the same year, the per capita income for the city was R$11,119.

==Demographics==
The population of the municipality in 2011, according to the IBGE, was 1,302,001 inhabitants, being the most populous municipality in the state and 12th in Brazil. The main reason for the large population in the vicinity of Goiânia and Brasília — that spurred the growth of the city and the region between it and the federal capital — making the axis Brasília-Goiânia&#x27;s third largest agglomeration in the country, bringing together about nine million people. The metropolitan area of Goiânia is the tenth largest agglomeration urban Brazil, with a population of 2,173,141, presents a population density of 782.5 inhabitants per , the largest of its state.

The Human Development Index Municipal (HDI) of Goiânia is considered high by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), at 0.832, the second largest of any state of Goiás (in 242 municipalities); third of all Midwest Region of Brazil (in 446) and 111 from all over Brazil (in 5507). Considering only the education, the index value is 0.933 (classified as very high), while Brazil&#x27;s is 0.849. The longevity index is 0.751 (0.638 is Brazilian) and income is 0.813 (that of Brazil is 0.723). The city has most of the indicators high and similar to the national average according to UNDP. The literacy rate is 96.78% of adults. The incidence of poverty, measured by the IBGE, is 3.64%; the lower the incidence of poverty is 2.92%; the top is 4.35%; and subjective poverty incidence is 4.35%.

===Social inequality===

Among Brazil&#x27;s metropolises, Goiânia has the lowest number of &quot;favelas&quot; (Portuguese for slums) according to data extracted from the 2010 census by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, the IBGE. The IBGE named seven areas in Goiânia as being &quot;subnormal agglomerations&quot;, a government term for irregular housing. In these locales, however, most of the households do have electricity, water, and trash collection.

While perhaps not fitting the criteria of favelas, Goiânia has several sectors, particularly on the outskirts, that are low income.

===Ethnicity and immigration===
Goiânia is a multiracial city as the result of intense migration. The populace has intimate connection with the settlement of the interior of the Brazilian center-west, gradually attracted mainly by migrants from the interior of Goiás and other regions in other states of Brazil. According to a survey in 2010, most migrants are from Minas Gerais, Bahia, Tocantins, Maranhão, São Paulo and Pará. According to the census of the IBGE 2022, in search of self-declaration, the population of Goiânia is composed of Multiracial (48.0%), White (43.6%), Black (7.9%), Asian (0.3%) and Amerindian (0.1%).

Initially, Goiânia was populated by migrants from the interior of Goiás. Its creation was crucial to the population growth in the state, since Vila Boa, the ancient capital showed signs of declining population, is considered a setback for the state. The founding of Goiânia is now considered a successful settlement of the Brazilian interior. Today, the population coming from Goiânia is predominantly Minas Gerais, Bahia, Tocantins, Maranhão, São Paulo and Pará, respectively.

===Religion===
Like the cultural variety verifiable in Goiânia, there are religious manifestations present in the city. According to the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), the population of Goiânia is composed mostly of Catholics (50.8%), evangelicals (32.4%), and spiritists (4.2%). Approximately 10% of the population has no religion. It is also home to a number of practitioners of other religions (2.3%).

==Education==
Notable institutes include:

* Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG)
* Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Goiás (PUC-GO)
* Universidade Estadual de Goiás (UEG)
* Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia de Goiás (IFG)
*Faculdade Unida de Campinas (FacUnicamps)

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Road====

Goiânia is connected to the federal capital, Brasília, via a four-lane tolled highway (BR-060) and to São Paulo via another four-lane tolled highway (BR-153). The state of Goiás maintains the main artery roads (marked GO-xxx) in and out of the capital: four-lane roads GO-403, GO–020, GO–080, GO–070, and GO–060.

As Goiânia was a planned city, the downtown cores (Setores Central/Oeste/Sul) are relatively easy to navigate. Along the years, the planned urban development was replaced by the typical Brazilian way of urban growth, i.e., pure laissez-faire. Social and urban demands were neglected.

Due to this lack of planning and reliable public transportation, Goiânia is the metropolis with the highest number of cars per capita in the country; there are 1,000,000 registered motor vehicles in the city. The many vehicles on the roads cause major congestion during peak times.

====Rail====
The Railway line was closed in the 1970s, though the art deco station remains open to the public. Nowadays transportation of goods is carried out via the connecting highways.

====Public transportation====
All public transportation is via bus. Bus service in Goiânia is provided by several transportation companies working under the municipality.

There is a bus system map the can be founded in RMTC site. Buses run on a predictable time schedule. Goiânia is the only city of South America that has the ITS technology of bus transport, but the buses are usually full. Unlike most Brazilian cities, there are no ticket collectors on the buses in Goiânia; all the fares are collected using magnetic paper cards and turnstiles. Passes are provided by SitPASS and can be purchased from street vendors or in small shops throughout the city.

Anhanguera Avenue is one of the largest/longest avenues in the city. It underwent major work in the late 1990s that created a dedicated bus lane for its entire length, with stations every 0.5 kilometer. The bus lanes are in the center of the avenue, giving it a distinct look. The fare to travel on the Anhanguera bus route is half of normal fare, and all buses on this route are articulated buses.

=====The new contract=====
Under the new contract, firmed in 2009, many aspects of the public transportation are being changed:

*The terminal stations are now placed under administration of the companies that are refurbishing them;
*The buses are being equipped with GPS modules to solve the schedule problem and many other benefits, adapted to give accessibility to disabled people, radios to give fast response on reroutes and other events, and other minor changes;
*The introduction of the CityBus, a service of microbuses focused on giving a choice to people of higher wealth to use the public transit system instead of their cars and to tourists who are visiting the city.
*Changes on &quot;Eixo Anhanguera&quot; (Anhanguera axis) and its terminals. It is unclear what changes that will be made, but one of the main issues under discussion is the much criticized change in fares; in future, a person that gets on a terminal from the axis to integrate with an inter-municipal metropolitan line will have to pay a complete fare.
*A North-South axis is part of the project, but as of August/09 it has not been implemented yet
*An Operational Control Center that will monitor the bus traffic through GPS.
*A free number for users to call to know how much time is left before the next bus arrives is another part of project that has not yet been implemented.

===Airports===
Santa Genoveva Airport is on the northeast side Goiânia. Six airlines fly out of this airport to destinations in Brazil. The new Santa Genoveva International Airport started operating in May, 2016. In total, the new airport has 34,100 m2, 4 gates, 23 check-in counters, 11 elevators, 4 escalators, 3 baggage carousels and 3 inspection lines with X-ray and metal detectors. According to Infraero, with this structure, the new airport can receive up to 6,5 million passengers a year.

Aeródromo Nacional de Aviação handles general aviation operations.

===Security===
Goiânia is considered a safe city compared to most state capitals within Brazil. The average murder rate per year is under 450 persons per year according to the Goiás State Police. It was, however, found in a study in 2011 performed by a Mexican think tank — the Citizens&#x27; Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice — that Goiânia ranks as the 40th most dangerous city in the world.

The city is patrolled and under the watch of the Goias Military Police, which is responsible for responding to crime and maintaining check points in the city and state. The Military Police are normally dressed in light tan military uniforms while patrolling. The prosecution and investigations of crime and all administration issues are handled by the Civil police (&quot;Policia Civil&quot;).

Within Goiânia traffic rules are enforced by the &quot;AMT&quot;, whose members are traffic wardens with some minor police powers. This unit falls under the ownership of the city. Their responsibilities are to ensure road rules are enforced and attend to all accidents on the city streets.

==Green areas==

Goiânia is home to a large number of skyscrapers dominating the center and one-floor family homes spreading out across the verdant tree-covered plain. Many of the streets are lined with tropical fruit trees, and there are many parks with remnants of the original tropical vegetation. Thirty percent of the city area is planted in trees — of the .

The most important of these parks are the Parque Zoológico, Parque Vaca Brava, Parque Ecológico, Bosque dos Buritis and Parque Areião. One of the biggest parks is the Bosque dos Buritís with an area of 140,000 square m and containing many buriti palm trees, which have a yellow fruit. Parque Areião is home to monkeys native to the area. Almost all of the parks are surrounded by walking paths.

Goiânia is known for being the ‘spring capital’ and was planned as a modern city, growing outside from the center. In the starting years this building plan worked well, but through the quick growth the plan was not followed to the letter, with the exception of the green areas, causing severe infrastructure problems in some areas, in particular with the public transport and healthcare systems.

In the Bosque dos Buritis is the Monument for World Peace, designed by Siron Franco. Another attraction is the Chico Mendes Botanic Garden, housing trees and flowers like bromelias, orchids, fruit trees and a lake.

The municipality contains part of the Altamiro de Moura Pacheco State Park, created in 1992.

===Parque Zoológico===

Created in 1946, the zoo contains over 1,000 animals, including mammals, birds, and reptiles. Five streams have their source in the park, which, besides the zoo, contains the Horto Florestal and the Lago das Rosas (&quot;Lake of Roses&quot;). The park is in the Setor Oeste, one of the richest residential areas of Goiânia.

===Buriti Park===
In the center of the city this is Goiânia&#x27;s oldest green area. It has an area of . There is a running track and exercise area, that has pull-up bars and sit-up benches with various inclines. There are three artificial lakes created by Buriti Stream. It is home to the Goiânia Art Museum and the Free Center of Arts. It houses a group of marmosets and many turtles.

===Vaca Brava Park===

Vaca Brava Park, renamed Parque Sulivan Silvestre after Dr. Sulivan Silvestre de Oliveira. Every day at dawn hundreds of people begin their daily activities by walking or jogging along the sidewalk that encloses Parque Vaca Brava. It has an area of and contains a lake, a forest with native species and places for exercise.

Vaca Brava (which could be roughly translated as Angry Cow) has become a symbol of the new thriving area of the Setor Bueno, which has flourished in recent decades and is now one of the most important zones of Goiânia.

===Areião Park===
The Areião is one of the largest green areas of Goiânia. In a wealthy area, it is known for its dense vegetation, where monkeys are spotted very often. Besides the many trails, there is a lake, a jogging route and many wooden buildings, including a small theater, consisting of a stage and many seats in the middle of a bamboo forest.

===Cobra Veiga center for snake research===
Located in an area of , it has an infrastructure for 750 serpents of different species, in addition to a laboratory and a rodent house. Its main activities are the extraction of poison for medicinal purposes, research on behavior of serpents in captivity and the recuperation of degraded areas and the preservation of springs and their forest.

==Leisure==
The leisure options are diverse. There are many shopping malls. There are numerous gyms, public and private. The city has a 45,000 capacity stadium: the Serra Dourada Stadium. Goiânia has a racetrack (Ayrton Senna International Racetrack), a kart track and a horse racing track.

===Sports===
Goiânia has five association football clubs: Goiás Esporte Clube, Atlético Clube Goianiense, Vila Nova Futebol Clube, Goiânia Esporte Clube, Monte Cristo Esporte Clube. Goiás compete in the Série A, while Atlético Goianiense compete in the Série B, and Vila Nova in the Série B.

Goiânia has two main sport stadiums that are used by the teams. Both stadiums are property of the State of Goias. The biggest one is the Serra Dourada Stadium. The stadium has the capacity of 50,049 spectators and it is used especially by Goiás Esporte Clube and Vila Nova Futebol Clube. Other important stadium in Goiânia is the Pedro Ludovico Teixeira Stadium, also known as Olímpico Stadium. The current capacity is 12,055 spectators and it is most used by Atlético Clube Goianiense.
===Museums===
The most important museums are the Museu Antropológico da Universidade Federal de Goiás, Instituto Goiano de Pré-História e Antropologia, Fundação Museu de Ornitologia, Museu de Arte Contemporânea and Museu Zoroastro Artiaga. One interesting place is the so-called Memorial do Cerrado.
=== Music ===
With several double success, Goiás itself is the cradle of the sertanejo (country music) genre. Two types of sertanejo predominate: is identified as the old sertanejo music and sertanejo universitário as the new sertanejo music.

Goiânia, as the capital of a state that was rural until the 1980s, has been traditionally influenced by the sertanejo style, strongly connected with the countryside lifestyle. Though the sertanejo is still an icon of Goiás&#x27; culture, the rock scene is seen by some as a response to it and as the creator center of a Goianiense legitimately culture, independent of the countryside culture. Goiânia is a leading center in the underground rock movement in Brazil.

Goiânia is home to one of the most important rock scenes from Brazil. It started in the early 1990s, with the creation of the first independent rock festivals in the city. Independent labels like Monstro Discos, Two Beers or Not Two Beers and Insetus flourished and have been crucial to support and broadcast the scene, which, being completely independent from the mainstream media, sometimes is not known even to native Goianienses.

The main styles are alternative or indie rock represented by bands like MQN, Black Drawing Chalks, Violins, Torn Birds, Hang The Superstars, Valentina, NEM, Fantasma de Agnes and Flores Indecentes; punk and hardcore by bands like Desastre, Vacilo, , Descarga Negativa, Senhores, Umbral and HC-137; and metal with bands like Ressonância Mórfica (unlike most metal bands they sing in archaic Portuguese), Spiritual Carnage, Eternal Devastation and Hellphoria. There are two major independent festivals held in the city: Bananada (usually held in May) and Goiânia Noise (usually in December).

The DJ &quot;Alok&quot; was born in the city.

<text>USS Gridley (DLG-21/CG-21), a guided missile cruiser, was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named after Charles Vernon Gridley, who distinguished himself with Admiral George Dewey&#x27;s force at the Battle of Manila Bay on 1 May 1898.

Her keel was laid down by the Puget Sound Bridge and Drydock Company of Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 31 July 1961 sponsored by Mrs. Stuart D. Rose, great-granddaughter of Captain Gridley, and commissioned on 25 May 1963.

==1960s==
After outfitting at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, &quot;Gridley&quot; made a goodwill visit to British Columbia and then conducted acceptance trials out of her homeport, Long Beach, California. The new cruiser returned to Puget Sound Shipyard from 8 November to 9 December 1963, after which she joined the Pacific Fleet as &quot;planned&quot; flagship of Destroyer Squadron 19.

Following shakedown out of San Diego, California, early in 1964, &quot;Gridley&quot; departed Long Beach 8 April and steamed via Pearl Harbor to Australia for commemoration of the Battle of the Coral Sea, arriving Adelaide, South Australia, on 5 May. &quot;Gridley&quot; also visited Perth and Geraldton on the western coast of Australia. The frigate next headed for the Philippines, stopping at Subic Bay on 29 May through 31 May, before proceeding to Okinawa on 2 June and Sasebo, Japan, on 8 June.

Heading south once more, she returned to Subic Bay and visited Hong Kong. On 4 August, she got underway for the South China Sea escorting the aircraft carrier to strengthen American naval forces off Vietnam after Communist motor torpedo boats had attacked destroyers and (companion members of DESRON-19) in the Gulf of Tonkin. But for a brief visit to Subic Bay, she remained on station serving screening and picket duty, coordinating antiaircraft warfare efforts, and relaying communications. Before she left the fighting zone 6 September, the ship&#x27;s competent and dedicated service won her the Navy Unit Commendation. She departed Subic Bay on 7 November and reached Long Beach on 21 November.

&quot;Gridley&quot; operated along the West Coast until heading back to the Western Pacific 10 July 1965. Stopping at Pearl Harbor and Yokosuka en route, she steamed to the South China Sea to support aircraft carriers of the Seventh Fleet as the flattops attacked targets in Vietnam. On four occasions in the next four months, she rescued pilots who ditched at sea. She returned to Yokosuka on 7 December but resumed station in the South China Sea on 22 December to serve as &quot;Tomcat,&quot; responsible for checking-in planes returning to their carriers. Early in 1966 she headed for home and reached Long Beach 1 February.

In 1965 &quot;Gridley&quot; was runner up of the Capt. Edward F. Ney Memorial Award, for the best feeding food ship in the Navy.(Medium afloat class) In 1966, the destroyer leader won the Capt. Edward F. Ney Memorial Award, for the best feeding food ship in the navy (Medium afloat class).
In that same time period, a letter of Commendation from the Commander Cruiser Destroyer Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, to the Gridley Commanding Officer A. M. Sackett, stated, the Gridley won the Battle Efficiency Competition within Destroyer Squadron NINETEEN for the period ending 30 June 1966. The Gridley had also won the Supply Efficiency Award.
&quot;Gridley&quot; operated along the California coast until sailing for the Orient 18 November. She left Subic Bay 2 January 1967 for plane guard duty in the China Sea and the Gulf of Tonkin. After varied duties in the fighting zone, she sailed for Australia en route to the West Coast and arrived Long Beach 8 June to prepare for future action.

On 8 June 1967 Ensign John Kerry reported on board for his first tour of sea duty. His tour ended a year later, on 6 June 1968, when &quot;Gridley&quot; returned from her deployment.

==1970s==
On 20 November 1970, after being re-commissioned having received a major overhaul of radar, sonar and anti-air and anti-submarine warfare weapons systems making &quot;Gridley&quot; the first ship of her class to be outfitted with NTDS. With stops at Pearl Harbor, Subic Bay, Yokohama, Yokosuka and Sasebo. Served as &quot;shotgun&quot; for the aircraft carriers , USS &quot;Constellation&quot; and in the Gulf of Tonkin.

In 1972, &quot;Gridley&quot; was the first ship of the class to be fitted with digital missile fire control systems providing her with the capability to fire Standard Missile Type 2. Several years later, the 3 in/50s were replaced by 8 AGM-84 Harpoon missiles and 2 Phalanx CIWS were added.

&quot;Gridley&quot; was reclassified as a guided missile cruiser with hull classification symbol CG-21 on 30 June 1975. That year, she provided air traffic control and on-station support during &quot;Operation Frequent Wind&quot;, the evacuation during the collapse of South Vietnam. &quot;Gridley&quot; was also on-station air traffic controller during the &quot;Mayagüez&quot; incident. &quot;Gridley&quot; was based in Subic Bay, Philippines, during the 1975 Westpac. During the 1975 year, &quot;Gridley&quot; appears to have been part of Cruiser-Destroyer Group 3.

In 1976, &quot;Gridley&quot; made a Westpac tour. During her trip across the Pacific, &quot;Gridley&quot; transited the 180th parallel (the International Date Line) at midnight 3 July. &quot;Gridley&quot; went directly from 3 to 5 July, resulting in her crew being the few Americans to miss the 200th anniversary of Independence Day. (&quot;Gridley&quot; celebrated the missing 4 July upon crossing the dateline in December, when an extra day is gained.)

During the 1976 Westpac, &quot;Gridley&quot; was based in Yokosuka, Japan.

On 21 August 1976, &quot;Gridley&quot; was involved in the fallout of Axe Murder Incident. This involved the murder of two U.S. Army officers by North Korean soldiers. &quot;Gridley&quot; was in-port in Yokosuka, Japan when this event happened; by the next morning the entire battle group was underway and stood off the coast of Korea for nearly a month.

==1980s==
In early 1980 &quot;Gridley&quot; and the frigate escorted the Battle Group/ 31st MEU from Pearl Harbor as a reserve in what culminated as Operation Eagle Claw, the effort to rescue the Iranian Embassy hostages. These 31st MEU deployments routinely included the Indian Ocean with port calls from Busan to Mombasa to include Diego Garcia.

In 1981 the ship deployed with Battle Group Charlie to the Middle East.

Upon returning to San Diego, California, in March 1982, &quot;Gridley&quot; was once again operating in Southern California waters, until October when she returned to Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an extensive upgrade and an overhaul of all engineering machinery. More upgrades were made to the ship&#x27;s fire control and air search radars, sonar system was upgraded from the AN/SQS-23 to the AN/SQQ-23 PAIR, and the Phalanx close-in weapon system was installed during 1982. &quot;Gridley&quot; returned to the operational fleet in October 1983.

In July 1987 &quot;Gridley&quot; was part of the USS &quot;Ranger&quot; battle group, conducting strikes against Iranian oil platforms during Operation Nimble Archer, returning to San Diego in January 1988. The ship then departed San Diego, California for the Persian Gulf on 15 December 1988, operating with the &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer to escort reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers through the Strait of Hormuz during Operation Earnest Will. While homeward bound, transiting the South China Sea, &quot;Gridley&quot; rescued Vietnamese refugees sighted in a small boat off of the coast of Vietnam. A Vietnamese-speaking crewman aboard &quot;Gridley&quot; was able to translate for those rescued, facilitating the process. The crew was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for their rescue efforts.

&quot;Gridley&quot; returned to San Diego in June 1989. On 17 October of that year, the ship&#x27;s visit to Naval Station, Treasure Island, San Francisco, was interrupted by the 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area. &quot;Gridley&quot;″s crew provided assistance to victims in San Francisco&#x27;s severely damaged Marina district, and was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for disaster recovery efforts.

==1990s==
From February 1990 until March 1991, &quot;Gridley&quot; received the New Threat Upgrade at Southwest Marine Shipyard in San Diego, California. During the US$55 million overhaul, all engineering, berthing and food service areas were upgraded, and the ship&#x27;s combat systems were dramatically enhanced. Improvements to the air search radars and Combat Direction System improved the ship&#x27;s ability to detect and engage multiple air threats with its SM-1ER and SM-2ER surface-to-air missiles.

Following an extensive operational evaluation and qualification phase, &quot;Gridley&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf, the ship operated in support of the aircraft carrier . &quot;Gridley&quot; rescued the disabled merchant vessel &quot;Adel 11&quot; in the North Arabian Sea in June 1992. When Operation Southern Watch, the enforcement of a &quot;no-fly&quot; zone over southern Iraq, commenced in August, &quot;Gridley&quot; was the first ship on station off the coast of Kuwait. She provided coastal radar coverage and air-defense protection for ships in the northern Persian Gulf.

&quot;Gridley&quot; returned to San Diego in October 1992 and was overhauled at the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company from January through April 1993. During that time, the ship was back fitted to accommodate the new SM-2ER block III missile. The modification gave the ship the capability to defeat the sea-skimming cruise missiles which have proliferated worldwide in the 1990s. In July 1993, &quot;Gridley&quot; fired several of the new missiles on the Pacific Missile Test Center range, scoring three successful hits. That same month, the ship rendezvoused with USS &quot;Constellation&quot; in Acapulco, Mexico, escorting her back to San Diego, after the carrier&#x27;s three-year Service Life Extension Program overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.

After a final port visit to San Francisco, in October 1993 &quot;Gridley&quot; returned to San Diego, where she was decommissioned, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, and transferred to the Maritime Administration for temporary lay-up on 21 January 1994. She was laid up in the Suisun Bay, California, reserve to await disposal. She was scrapped in 2005.

<text>The Melbourne railway network comprises 17 railway lines organised into six groups and is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. The first section of the network opened in 1854, making the Melbourne metropolitan rail network the oldest rail system in Australia. Most of the network is above ground, with the main underground section being the City Loop.

These 17 lines consist of 16 electrified lines and 1 diesel shuttle service. The electrified 16 lines are the Alamein, Belgrave, Glen Waverley and Lilydale lines which are part of the Burnley Group, the Cranbourne and East Pakenham lines which are part of the Caulfield Group, the Hurstbridge and Mernda lines which are part of the Clifton Hill Group, the Frankston, Werribee and Williamstown lines which are part of the Cross City Group, the Craigieburn, Sunbury and Upfield lines which are part of the Northern Group, the Sandringham line and the Flemington Racecourse line. In addition to these 16 electrified lines, there is also the Stony Point line which operates as a shuttle service between Frankston and Stony Point. 

There are 222 suburban railway stations that are currently operational in Melbourne. In addition to the stations currently opened, there are an additional 73 closed to passengers and 9 stations expected to open in the near future.

The network is broken up into two Myki ticketing zones. These zones determine how much it would cost to travel from one station to another, with cross zone travel costing more than travelling within the same zone.

<text>HMS &quot;Gipsy&quot; was a G-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. She spent most of the pre-war period as part of the Mediterranean Fleet. The ship was transferred to the British Isles to escort shipping in local waters shortly after the beginning of World War II. Less than a month after her arrival she struck a mine outside Harwich and sank with the loss of 30 of her crew. Her wreck was salvaged and slowly scrapped over the course of the war.

==Description==
&quot;Gipsy&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. &quot;Gipsy&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime.

The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft defence &quot;Gipsy&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. One rail and two depth charge throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Gipsy&quot; was laid down by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, at Govan, Scotland, on 4 September 1934, launched on 7 November 1935 and completed on 22 February 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £250,364. Aside from a brief period assigned to the 20th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet after her commissioning, &quot;Gipsy&quot; spent the pre-war period assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet. 

On the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, the ships of the Mediterranean Fleet were used to evacuate British subjects, and later and other foreign nationals from Spanish Mediterranean ports, while the Home fleet operated off the northern coast of Spain. &quot;Gipsy&quot; was deployed to the Barcelona area to assist in the evacuation. In total, the Royal Navy evacuated about 6000 refugees (of which about 2000 were British) from Spanish ports in July–August 1936. On 13 February 1937, &quot;Gipsy&quot; and the destroyer were on passage between Gibraltar and Malta when they were attacked by an aircraft carrying Spanish Nationalist markings. several bombs were dropped by the aircraft, all of which missed the two destroyers, while the two destroyers opened fire on the aircraft. Neither the destroyers or the aircraft was damaged during the engagement. &quot;Gipsy&quot; was refitted at Devonport Dockyard between 2 June and 30 July 1938.

On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, &quot;Gipsy&quot; was deployed with the 1st Destroyer Flotilla for patrols and contraband control in the Eastern Mediterranean, based at Alexandria. &quot;Gipsy&quot; and her entire flotilla were transferred to the Western Approaches Command at Plymouth in October. On 12 November she collided with her sister ship, , en route to Harwich, and her new assignment with the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla, but she was only slightly damaged. The ship rescued three German airmen outside Harwich harbour on 21 November and returned to port to turn them over the army.

Later that evening, &quot;Gipsy&quot; set out with the destroyers , , , and to hunt for U-Boats thought to be minelaying in the North Sea. Just outside the harbour boom she triggered one of the two magnetic mines dropped about two hours earlier by two German seaplanes, and, almost broken in half, sank on the edge of the deepwater channel at . 31 of her crew, including the captain, Lt-Cdr Crossley, were killed or fatally injured, 115 were rescued by the other destroyers and by harbour launches. The inquiry determined that, though the harbour defences had been on alert (UK National Archive 248 Heavy AA Battery War Diary WO 166/2529), and had actually seen and plotted both the seaplanes and their mines, their reporting had been inaccurate. Though the Harwich admiral had told the destroyers to hug the side of the channel opposite to where the mines fell, he had not stipulated why, nor that the ships were in any particular danger. Apart from those on the bridge, Gipsy&#x27;s crew were unaware of any danger at all as a result some had gone to sleep below decks, and no contingency plan had been made to ready lifeboats.
(sources—Admiralty Board of Inquiry Minutes and Report—UK National Archive ADM 1/22793, logs of &quot;Keith&quot; and &quot;Boadicea&quot; ADM 53/109431 and 107799; correspondence with Captain R D Franks, Gipsy&#x27;s 1st Lieutenant, and his article in &quot;Highlight&quot; Harwich Society magazine).

There was controversy at the time, and later, about this lack of warning, and also about the failure of the local defences to fire on the German seaplanes (Nore Command War Diary ADM 199/375; 6 Anti-Aircraft Division War Diary WO 166/2168l Captain R D Franks; Highlight). It turned out that their failure to fire had been due to an Army Anti-Aircraft Command order that unidentified aircraft should not be engaged, though the defenders &quot;had&quot;, at the time, recognised their nationality, if not their type—and seen their mines. (ADM 1/22793, 515 Coast Artillery Regiment War Diary WO 166/1718).

The wreck remained upright on the seabed with only the bridge and forward gun visible at high tide. Only buckled plating amidships held the two main sections of the wreck together and they were cut by explosives when salvage began shortly after her sinking. The two halves were raised by pontoons, and were subsequently broken up separately. of ferrous scrap and of non-ferrous metals were recovered between June 1940 and February 1944.

<doc id="472994" wikidata="Q113505" url="?curid=472994" title="If I See You in My Dreams">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Noriyuki Yamahana. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Business Jump&quot; from 1994 to 1999, with its chapters collected in seventeen volumes. It was adapted by J.C.Staff into a three-episode original video animation (OVA) series released from April to December 1998, followed by a sixteen-episode anime television series broadcast on TBS in December 1999.

==Plot==
The story follows a Japanese salaryman in a big city, who falls in love with , a kindergarten teacher. Masuo tries repeatedly to court Nagisa, but every time he seems to make progress, something inevitably goes wrong. Nagisa, in fact, likes Masuo, but due to a previous heartbreak, she constantly pushes him away.

As the series progresses, it becomes more thoughtful and mature, with many of the problems evolving out of the characters&#x27; personalities rather than being imposed artificially by circumstances. Many of the coincidental misunderstandings have to do with Masuo interacting with coworker , the daughter of the company president, who has fallen in love with Masuo, but Masuo lacks the confidence to believe it to be true.

Initially, Masuo has to face two other comical suitors for Nagisa&#x27;s love. One being Kaizuka, a tall muscular physical education high school teacher, and Kujira, a short rich and perverted real estate agent. Later on he has to face much more serious competition from Nagisa&#x27;s first love, Minato.

At one point later on, Masuo takes in a pregnant woman out of compassion. This information makes its way to Nagisa, but in a different form; she is told that the girl is pregnant with his child, but she eventually determines the truth for herself. The series ends with Nagisa having their child named Yuka in her arm smiling happily.

The TV series takes a more comedic tone than the OVA and involves much of the early unlucky coincidences from the manga. In the TV series, Masuo faces no competition from other suitors but merely must face Nagisa&#x27;s difficulty with men while Kaizuka and Kujira appear in the OVA to try to win Nagisa&#x27;s love.

==Reception==
===Original video animation===
Hannah Stanton of THEM Anime Reviews gave the OVA 2 out of 5 stars. Stanton wrote that the series &quot;lacks some of the charm&quot; of other similar works like &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;, calling the characters &quot;amazingly bland&quot; and stating that every romantic drama stereotype is expected. Patrick King of Animefringe called the OVA &quot;predictable&quot; and that due to its brevity it does not have time to drag out various potential conflicts, introducing instead problems only long enough to solve them and move on; however, King said that he enjoyed that aspect of the show. Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network wrote that while the OVA episodes are &quot;somewhat funny at times&quot;, they are &quot;too short to really accomplish anything&quot;, stating that the &quot;sweet and caring&quot; emotional moments of the series are &quot;the aspects that keep the OVA enjoyable.&quot; Chris Beveridge of AnimeOnDVD also called the OVA &quot;predictable&quot;, but adding that he had no problem with that because it &quot;so nicely done&quot;, calling it a &quot;nice decent romance without the real bad stuff&quot;.

===Anime===
In comparing the OVA to TV series, King said that in the latter there in more time for character development, more comedy and sight gags and &quot;multiple counts of outright nudity&quot;. Beveridge, making the same comparison, said that the TV series is &quot;just more of the same – sometimes exactly the same – but with more filler added to it&quot;, adding that &quot;the charm from the OVA series is really lacking here&quot;. Dong gave the TV series a B grade. Dong called the series &quot;awful&quot;, &quot;extremely repetitive&quot; and &quot;highly predictable&quot;, adding that the &quot;one-dimensionality&quot; of the characters is &quot;just disappointing&quot;. Dong praised the &quot;comical use of figurative animation&quot;, which draws the line between regular imagery and an exaggerated portrayal of reality. Enoch Lau of THEM Anime reviews gave the TV series 1 out of 5 stars. Lau compared the series negatively to &quot;Love Hina&quot;, also criticizing the repetition of its &quot;plot cycle&quot; in its sixteen episodes and calling the animation and art quality &quot;obviously dated&quot;.

<doc id="472996" wikidata="Q313213" url="?curid=472996" title="Ahaziah of Israel">
<text>Ahaziah (, &quot;Yah has grasped&quot;; also , &quot;Ochozias&quot; in the Septuagint and the Douai-Rheims translation) was the eighth king of the northern Kingdom of Israel and the son of Ahab and Jezebel. Like his father, he reigned from Samaria. William F. Albright has dated his reign to 850–849 BC, while E. R. Thiele offers the dates 853–852 BC.

The author of the &quot;Books of Kings&quot; criticized him for following the ways of his father Ahab and his mother Jezebel, and for making Israel sin &quot;in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat&quot;. Biblical commentator Albert Barnes notes that the phrase &quot;in the way of his mother&quot; does not occur anywhere else in the Hebrew Bible, and demonstrates the strong feeling of the writer of the Books of Kings as to the influence of Jezebel.

==Reign==

During his reign the Moabites revolted against his authority (). This event is recorded on the Mesha stele, an extensive inscription written in the Moabite language.

Ahaziah formed a business partnership with Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, in order to construct a fleet of trading ships. However, because Jehoshaphat had made an alliance with Ahaziah (who was doing the same evil as Ahab and Jezebel, his father and mother, in the kingdom of Israel) the ships were wrecked and never set sail.

His messengers, sent to consult Baal-Zebub (the god of prophecy in Ekron) regarding his recovery from the effects of a fall from the roof-gallery of his palace, were met on the way by Elijah, who sent them back to tell the king that, for his deeds and for seeking a god that was not the God of Israel, he would never rise from his bed (; ). According to the Second Book of Kings, he did not recover from his injuries and died.

Having no son, Ahaziah was succeeded as king of Israel by Jehoram, his younger brother.

==Ancestors==
These are ancestors of Ahaziah according to the Bible.

<text>HMS &quot;Gallant&quot; (H59) was a G-class destroyer, built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. &quot;Gallant&quot; was transferred from the Mediterranean Fleet shortly after the beginning of World War II to the British Isles, to escort shipping in local waters. She was slightly damaged by German aircraft during the evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk at the end of May 1940. Following repairs, &quot;Gallant&quot; was transferred to Gibraltar and served with Force H for several months. In November, the ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she escorted several convoys. She struck a mine in January 1941 and was towed to Malta for repairs. These were proved extensive and &quot;Gallant&quot; was further damaged by near-misses during an air raid in April 1942, before they were completed. The additional damage made the ship uneconomical to repair so she was scuttled as a blockship in 1943. Her wreck was broken up in 1953.

==Description==
&quot;Gallant&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. &quot;Gallant&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime, but it increased to 146 in wartime.

The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft defence &quot;Gallant&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One rail and two depth charge throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.

==Service==
&quot;Gallant&quot; was laid down by Alexander Stephen and Sons in Glasgow, Scotland, on 15 September 1934, launched on 26 September 1935 and completed on 25 February 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £252,920. She was assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. &quot;Gallant&quot; patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the edicts of the Non-Intervention Committee. She pulled off a Spanish merchantman that had grounded between Almeria and Málaga on 20 December 1936. The ship was attacked by a Spanish Nationalist aircraft off Cape San Antonio on 6 April 1937, but was not damaged. The next month she returned to Great Britain for an overhaul at Sheerness between 31 May and 21 July 1937.

When World War II began in September 1939, &quot;Gallant&quot; was in the Mediterranean, but she and her entire flotilla were transferred to the Western Approaches Command at Plymouth in October. After a boiler cleaning, the ship was reassigned at the end of the month to the Nore Command in Harwich for patrol and escort duties. On 2 February 1940 &quot;Gallant&quot; and her sister ship, , rescued the crew from the oil tanker &quot;British Councillor&quot; which was sinking after it had struck a mine. &quot;Gallant&quot; took over escorting Convoy HN 12 after the destroyer was sunk on 18 February and she rescued 12 survivors from the Swedish ship &quot;Santos&quot; near Duncansby Head a week later. On 20 March 1940 she escorted the armed merchant cruisers &quot;Cilicia&quot; and after they collided. The ship was refitted at Southampton between 28 March and 30 April and rejoined her flotilla at Harwich the next day. During the evening of 9/10 May, &quot;Gallant&quot; and the destroyer rescued most of the crew of the destroyer after the latter ship was torpedoed by a German E-boat in the North Sea.

While &quot;Gallant&quot; was participating in the Dunkirk evacuation, a near miss by a bomb on 29 May knocked out her steering and caused minor damage to her hull and electrical systems. She was repaired at Hull and encountered a German mine-laying sortie on the evening of 5/6 June off Lowestoft when in company with the destroyer . Later in June the ship was refitted in Chatham Dockyard with a 12-pounder anti-aircraft gun that replaced the rear torpedo tube mount.

After her refit &quot;Gallant&quot; was transferred to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla of the North Atlantic Command, arriving at Gibraltar on 30 July. On her voyage south the ship escorted the aircraft carrier which was loaded with a dozen Hawker Hurricane fighters. During Operation Hurry, &quot;Gallant&quot;, and three other destroyers, escorted &quot;Argus&quot; to a position south-west of Sardinia so the carrier could fly off her Hurricanes to Malta on 2 August. After her return to Gibraltar the ship was transferred to Force H. On 20 October, &quot;Gallant&quot;, her sister &quot;Griffin&quot; and the destroyer sank the east of Gibraltar. The ship escorted the battleship and the cruisers and during Operation Coat in early November as they joined the Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Gallant&quot; herself was transferred to the 14th Destroyer Flotilla at Malta on 10 November. She participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November during Operation Collar.

On 10 January 1941, during Operation Excess, the Italian torpedo boats and attempted an attack on the Allied convoy off Pantellaria. Right after the engagement, in which &quot;Vega&quot; was sunk, &quot;Gallant&quot; struck a mine that detonated her forward magazine, because the Italian action pushed the British convoy too much south of their pre-established route. The explosion blew the bow off the ship, killing 65 and injuring 15 more of her crew. Her sister &quot;Griffin&quot; rescued most of the survivors and the destroyer towed her stern-first to Malta. The ship was slowly repaired and in October 1941 it was estimated that they would be completed in June 1942. However, on 5 April 1942, she was extensively damaged by bomb splinters by an air raid on Valletta and had to be beached at Pinto&#x27;s Wharf to prevent her from sinking. She was judged to be a constructive total loss and any usable equipment was stripped from her hulk. &quot;Gallant&quot; was expended as a blockship at St Paul&#x27;s Island in September 1943, with the wreck being broken up in 1953.

<doc id="472998" wikidata="Q313214" url="?curid=472998" title="Ahaziah of Judah">
<text>Ahaziah of Judah (; &quot;Okhozias&quot;; ) or Jehoahaz I (; ), was the sixth king of Judah, and the son of Jehoram and Athaliah, the daughter (or possibly sister) of king Ahab of Israel. He was also the first Judahite king to be descended from both the House of David and the House of Omri, through his mother and successor, Athaliah.

According to , Ahaziah was 22 years old when he began to reign, and reigned for one year in Jerusalem. gives his age as 42 years when his reign began in Jerusalem.

William F. Albright has dated his reign to 842 BC, while E. R. Thiele offers the date 841/840 BC. As explained in the Rehoboam article, Thiele&#x27;s chronology for the first kings of Judah contained an internal inconsistency that placed Ahaziah&#x27;s reign one year after his mother Athaliah usurped the throne. Later scholars corrected this by dating these kings one year earlier, so that Ahaziah&#x27;s dates are taken as one year earlier than Thiele&#x27;s in the present article.

==Reign==
Ahaziah was the youngest son of king Jehoram of Judah. According to , his older brothers had been carried off in a Philistine and Arab raid.

Under the influence of his mother Athaliah, Ahaziah introduced forms of worship that offended the Yahwistic party.

Members of her family became his advisors and encouraged him to join his uncle Jehoram, king of Israel, in an expedition against Hazael, king of the Arameans. Jehoram was wounded in the battle, and went to recuperate at Jezreel. Ahaziah also left the field of conflict in Gilead, and, after a visit to Jerusalem, came to Jezreel for a conference with Jehoram, and was caught up in the revolt by Jehu. According to the account given in the Second Book of Kings, Ahaziah and Jehoram both went out to meet the rebellious general, with Jehoram learning too late of Jehu&#x27;s murderous intentions. Ahaziah watched as his uncle was shot by Jehu, who was armed with a bow. Ahaziah fled for his life, but was wounded at the pass of Gur in Ibleam and had strength only to reach Megiddo, where he died (). 2 Chronicles, however, gives a somewhat different account of Ahaziah&#x27;s death, which has him hiding in Samaria after Jehu&#x27;s &quot;coup&quot;, only to be found and killed by Jehu&#x27;s henchmen on their king&#x27;s orders.

==Tel Dan Stele==
The author of the inscription on the Tel Dan Stele (fragments of which were found in 1993 and 1994 during archaeological excavations of the site of Tel Dan) claimed to have slain both the king of the House of David in Judah, Ahaziah, and the king of Israel, Jehoram. The most likely author of this monument is Hazael of the Arameans. Although the inscription may be a contemporary witness of this period, kings of this period were inclined to boast and make exaggerated claims; it is not clear whether Jehu killed the two kings (as the Bible reports) or Hazael (as the Tel Dan Stele reports), or if Jehu acted in concert with Hazael. Bryant G. Wood notes that in 1 Kings 19:15 the prophet Elijah was directed by God to go to Damascus and anoint Hazael king of Aram, &quot;an unusual circumstance&quot;. Hazael later resumed his attacks on Israel.

==Chronological notes==
The calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. For Ahaziah, the Scriptural data allow the narrowing of his accession to some time between Nisan 1 of 841 BCE and the day before Tishri 1 of the same year. His death occurred within this six-month period. These dates are one year earlier than those given in the third edition of Thiele&#x27;s &quot;Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings&quot;, thereby correcting an internal consistency that Thiele never resolved, as explained in the Rehoboam article.

Leslie McFall proposed a coregency between Ahaziah and his father Jehoram that was occasioned by the disease Jehoram contracted one year before he died (). McFall&#x27;s conception of a one-year coregency is consistent with the seriousness of the disease contracted by Jehoram, such as would make it a matter of common sense to appoint a coregent. It would explain the apparent discrepancy between and . In the first reference, Ahaziah is said to begin in the 12th year of Jehoram of Israel, whereas the second gives it as Jehoram&#x27;s 11th year. The first reference would be to the start of the sole reign, the second to the start of the coregency, one year earlier. Thiele&#x27;s explanation of the apparent discrepancy between these two verses was that 2 Kings 8:25 was by non-accession reckoning and 2 Kings 9:29 by accession reckoning, reflecting the transition that Thiele said was taking place at this time from non-accession reckoning back to accession reckoning for the kingdom of Judah. Although Thiele&#x27;s suggestion has merit, McFall&#x27;s coregency has been adopted in the infobox below. This begins one-year coregency sometime in the six months on or after Nisan 1 of 842 BCE, which was in the 11th year of Jehoram of Israel (2 Kings 9:29) by Israel&#x27;s Nisan calendar and non-accession reckoning (2 Kings 9:29). By a Judean calendar the year would be 843/842 BCE, i.e. the year starting in Tishri of 843 BCE. The start of his sole reign would be in the six months following Nisan 1 of 841 BCE, in the 12th year of Jehoram of Israel (2 Kings 8:25); his death also occurred in this six-month interval.

<text>Baron Walpole of Walpole in the County of Norfolk is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain.

Since 1797 holders also hold the title of Baron Walpole of Wolterton. Past holders have also held the titles Baron Walpole of Houghton in the County of Norfolk, Viscount Walpole and [[Earl of Orford]] (second creation; 1742 to 1797), and Earl of Orford (third creation; 1806 to 1931). One holder held the title of Baron Clinton from 1781 to 1791.

==History==
===Grants===
The title of Baron Walpole of Walpole in the County of Norfolk was created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1723 for Robert Walpole, in honour of and during the lifetime of his father Sir Robert Walpole, the &quot;de facto&quot; first Prime Minister of Great Britain, with special remainder, failing male issue, to his brothers Edward and Horace, in default of this to the heirs male of his father, and in default of this to the heirs male of his grandfather Sir Thomas Walpole.

On Sir Robert&#x27;s retirement from the House of Commons in 1742, he received the titles Baron Walpole of Houghton in the County of Norfolk, Viscount Walpole and Earl of Orford, with the standard remainder.

The title of Baron Walpole of Wolterton in the County of Norfolk was created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1756 for Horatio Walpole, envoy to Paris and later The Hague, and younger brother of Sir Robert.

===Early holders===
When Sir Robert, the 1st Earl of Orford, died in 1745, he was succeeded by his eldest son, the aforementioned Robert, Lord Walpole of Walpole, who thus became the 2nd Earl of Orford. He had married Devonshire heiress Margaret Rolle in 1724. In 1751, she, by survival, became one of the co-heirs to the ancient Clinton barony, which was in abeyance. That abeyance was terminated in her favour in 1760, and she became the 15th Baroness Clinton.

The 2nd Earl of Orford was succeeded by his eldest son, the 3rd Earl. He notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk from 1757 to 1797. In 1781 he also succeeded his mother as 16th Baron Clinton. Lord Orford never married and on his death the barony of Clinton became dormant (see the Baron Clinton article for later history of this peerage), while the other titles were inherited by his uncle, the 4th Earl, at birth known as Horace Walpole, who was a politician and early expounder of the Neo-Gothic in architecture and the Gothic novel. He never married either and so on his death in 1797, three of his titles of different ranks became extinct, while he was succeeded as Baron Walpole of Walpole according to the special remainder by his cousin Horatio Walpole (known as the younger), who had already inherited his own father&#x27;s title, Baron Walpole of Wolterton.

===Horatio Walpole the Younger===
As said, Horatio Walpole (the Younger) succeeded his father as Baron Walpole of Wolterton in 1757 and eventually as Baron Walpole of Walpole in 1797. He had earlier represented King&#x27;s Lynn in Parliament. In favour with those in power, in 1806 the earldom of Orford was recreated for him.

===Later holders===
Horatio the younger&#x27;s son sat as Member of Parliament for Wigan and King&#x27;s Lynn before coming into his earldom. His grandson, the 4th Earl, briefly represented Wigan in the House of Commons.

The baronies of Walpole of Walpole and Walpole of Wolterton were inherited by the late 5th Earl&#x27;s distant cousin, who was a male-line descendant of the Hon. Thomas Walpole, second son of the 1st Baron Walpole of Wolterton. , the two remaining peerages are held by the 9th/7th Baron&#x27;s grandson, the 11th/9th Baron Walpole. The 10/8th Baron was one of the ninety hereditary peers who remained in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act of 1999, and sat as a cross-bencher, until his retirement on 13 June 2017.

The family seat is Mannington Hall, near Itteringham, Norfolk.

<text>Allegheny College is a private liberal arts college in Meadville, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded in 1815, Allegheny is the oldest college in continuous existence under the same name west of the Allegheny Mountains. It is a member of the Great Lakes Colleges Association and the Presidents&#x27; Athletic Conference and it is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

==History==
=== Pre-colonial history ===
The area where Allegheny College stands was the ancestral land of the Eriechronon people until the Iroquois Confederacy forced them out. Having been displaced from their ancestral lands in what is now Eastern Pennsylvania, the Lenape or Delaware Tribe moved into the now unoccupied region. They formed an alliance with the neighboring Seneca, one of the five tribes that made up the Iroquois Confederacy, and other displaced Lenape. Under the leadership of Chief Custalog, they founded the settlement of Cussewago. This settlement would later be abandoned and claimed by David Mead to become Meadville, Pennsylvania, on May 12, 1788.

===Early history===
Allegheny College was founded in April 1815 by Timothy Alden, a graduate of Harvard&#x27;s School of Divinity. The college has been affiliated with the United Methodist Church since 1833 but does not integrate religion into the classroom or pedagogy.
The first class, consisting of four male students, began their studies on July 4, 1816, without any formal academic buildings. Within six years, Alden accumulated sufficient funds to begin building a campus. The first building erected, the library, was designed by Alden himself, and is a notable example of early American architecture. Bentley Hall is named in honor of William Bentley, who donated his private library to the college, a collection of considerable value and significance. In 1824, Thomas Jefferson wrote to Alden, expressing the hope that his University of Virginia could someday possess the richness of Allegheny&#x27;s library. Alden served as president of the college until 1831 when financial and enrollment difficulties forced his resignation. Ruter Hall was built in 1853.

Allegheny began admitting women in 1870, early for a US college; a woman was valedictorian of the Allegheny class of 1875. By the time Ida Tarbell, future journalist, arrived in 1876, nineteen women had attended Allegheny and only two had graduated. Tarbell described Ruter Hall in her writing, &quot;...looking out on the town in the valley, its roofs and towers half hidden by a wealth of trees, and beyond it to a circle of round-breasted hills. Before I left Allegheny I had found a very precious thing in that severe room--the companionship there is in the silent presence of books.&quot;
In 1905, Allegheny built Alden Hall as a new and improved preparatory school. Over the decades, the college has grown in size and significance while still maintaining ties to the community.

===Recent history===
In 1970, the film &quot;Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me&quot; based on the Richard Fariña novel was filmed on college grounds.

While the word &quot;Allegheny&quot; is a brand for the college, it is also the name of a county, a river, and a mountain range, and the school has tried to prevent other entities from using this word. For example, Allegheny objected in 2006 when Penn State tried to rename one of its campuses &quot;Allegheny&quot;. Allegheny president Richard Cook said &#x27;Allegheny&#x27; was &quot;our brand.&quot; It sued the Philadelphia&#x27;s Allegheny Health and Research Foundation in 1997 to change its name.

Under president Richard J. Cook, Allegheny was reported to have had a &quot;stronger endowment, optimal enrollment, record retention rates, innovative new programs and many physical campus improvements.&quot; These years were marked by significant growth in the endowment, marked by a $115-million fund-raising drive, bringing the endowment to $150 million. In 2008, James H. Mullen Jr. took office as the 21st president of Allegheny.

The college and the town cooperate in many ways. One study suggested the Allegheny College generates approximately $93 million annually into Meadville and the local economy. Since 2002, Allegheny hosts classical music festivals during the summer. In October 2006, the college attracted negative publicity after local enforcement cited over 100 people for underage drinking at a college party. In July 2007, a 1,500-pound wrecking ball demolishing part of Allegheny&#x27;s Pelletier Library broke its chain, rumbled down the hill, careened &quot;back and forth across the street,&quot; hit nine parked cars, wrecked curbs, and crashed into the trunk of an Allegheny student&#x27;s car, pushing his car into two cars in front of him. Eight soccer balls in his car &quot;likely lessened the impact of the wrecking ball,&quot; and possibly spared his life, according to a police officer on the scene.

The college has sponsored panels on unusual topics such as face transplants (2009). Allegheny professors have joined highly visible initiatives; for example, Allegheny professor Michael Maniates, described as the &quot;nation&#x27;s leading authority on the politics of consumption,&quot; joined the board of a project about the twenty-minute film &quot;The Story of Stuff&quot; by filmmaker Annie Leonard, and generated headlines. Maniates said, &quot;We really need to think of ways of making it possible for people to think about working less and getting by on less.&quot; At present, environmental concerns are important at Allegheny, which in 2008 worked with Siemens to devise a &quot;total energy use reduction plan&quot; for the college.

==Campus==
The campus has 40 principal buildings on a central campus located just north of downtown Meadville, a outdoor recreational complex north of campus, called the Robertson Athletic Complex, and the Bousson nature reserve, protected forest, and experimental forest.

===Non-residential buildings===
* The Pelletier Library (in 2008) had 922,540 volumes (491,284 microform titles). Another estimate was that the library had 420,000 bound volumes, 227,000 microform titles, 1,000 periodicals, and 261,000 U.S. government and Pennsylvania state documents. The library has noteworthy Americana and Ida Tarbell collections, as well as materials concerning abolitionist John Brown&#x27;s years in Crawford County. computer lab, audiovisual center, and music listening system are there too. It is named after past president Lawrence L. Pelletier who served from 1955 to 1980. The Learning Commons, which is located in Pelletier Library, assists students with writing, research, public speaking and study skills, and also offers disability services.
* Newton Observatory houses a nine-inch refracting telescope and a computer-interfaced 10-inch Meade LX200 telescope with CCD camera. The Office of Public Safety and Security is also housed in the Newton Observatory.
* The Allegheny College Center for Experiential Learning (ACCEL) coordinates career internships, off-campus study programs, service-learning, pre-professional advising, and leadership development.
* A Counseling Center, which has joined the Winslow Health Center in Schultz Hall, offers guidance for students in adjusting to student life. The center is staffed by registered therapists and provides crisis and walk in hours to students, free of charge.
* Winslow Health Center is staffed by a registered nurse and offers routine diagnosis and treatment. The center also offers free STI testing to students on a monthly basis.
* The main dining facility is in Brooks Hall, and students can also dine at McKinley&#x27;s Food Court in the campus center. There have been efforts by students to support the relationship between food services and local farmers. Allegheny won a $79,545 grant in May 2009 to buy equipment to help with composting food waste, including a shredder mill, screening plant, conveyor, skid-steer loader and leaf collection system.
* The Center for Political Participation was founded at Allegheny in 2002 by political science professor Daniel M. Shea, following concerns about low youth voter turnout in the 2000 presidential election. The CPP conducts scholarly research related to youth political participation; sponsors on-campus events related to politics and the electoral process, such as panel discussions; and conducts community-outreach efforts, including the Model Campaign USA program, a campaign simulation designed to get high school students interested in electoral politics.
* Henderson Campus Center was recently renovated and includes McKinley&#x27;s food court, the bookstore, the game room, Grounds for Change—the student-run coffee house, the post office, and campus offices of college departments as well as student organizations. Also included in the Henderson Campus Center are the Bowman, Penelac &amp; Megahan Art Galleries. Allegheny has auctioned art at times to raise money to renovate other projects, such as the college&#x27;s Doane School of Art.

* Sports facilities include the $13 million David V. Wise Sport &amp; Fitness Center, which opened in 1997.
* A Women&#x27;s Center which is located in the basement of Walker Hall was established in 2003 to be a resource for research on gender issues and women&#x27;s history.
* The college established the Center for Economic and Environmental Development in 1997.

==Academics==
Allegheny College&#x27;s majors and minors fall into three spheres: Humanities, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences. There are some majors, such as Environmental Studies or International Studies, which fall into the interdisciplinary category. The college requires students to choose a minor as well as a major and encourages &quot;unusual combinations&quot; of majors and minors. A student&#x27;s major can be in the humanities, social sciences or natural sciences, but that student&#x27;s minor must be in a different division than their major.

Allegheny is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE).

About 30% of the college&#x27;s 2,100 students graduate in one of the STEM disciplines—science, technology, engineering, and math. Students must take at least two courses (8 semester credit hours) in a discipline other than their major or minor. 

The most popular majors, in terms of 2021 graduates, were Biology/Biological Sciences (35), Psychology (34), and Environmental Science (33).

Total credits for graduation are 128 semester credit hours and no more than 64 credit hours can be from any one department. Almost all courses carry four semester hours of credit.

The college requires all students to take a three-seminar series which &quot;encourages careful listening and reading, thoughtful speaking and writing, and reflective academic planning and self-exploration,&quot; to be completed in their first two years. Sophomores typically meet with faculty advisers eight times a year.

Allegheny requires seniors to complete a &quot;senior project&quot; in their major. Some senior projects can be quite ambitious; in 2007, one senior project involved comprehensive instructions for installing solar panels on the roof of a campus building.

Allegheny divides its academic calendar into two 15-week semesters. The school year typically runs from the last week of August to mid-May, with a short fall break in mid-October, a Wednesday-to-Sunday Thanksgiving break, a month-long winter break from mid-December to mid-January, and a week-long spring break in the third week of March.
It formerly had a Chinese language minor, which was discontinued with the Chinese program itself in 2022.

===Study abroad===
Allegheny offers direct enrollment programs at Lancaster University, England; James Cook University, Australia; University of Natal, South Africa; Capital Normal University, China; and Karl-Eberhard University, Germany. It also offers language and area studies programs in Seville, Spain; Angers, France; Karls-Eberhard University, Germany; and Querétaro, Mexico and internship programs in London, England; Paris, France; and Washington D.C. Programs geared to specific majors are also available, including environmental studies at the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, Israel; and the Center for Sustainable Development, Costa Rica; marine biology at the Duke University Marine Lab in North Carolina; and political science at American University. Allegheny faculty members have led domestic summer-study tours to New York, Yellowstone, Austria, Costa Rica, and South Africa. Individually arranged study abroad has taken students to Argentina, Canada (Nova Scotia), China, Cuba, Greece, Italy, Mexico, and Scotland.

===Cooperative and reciprocal programs===

Allegheny has medical school cooperative programs available with three institutions: Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Drexel University and Jefferson Medical College. Allegheny offers pre-professional programs in law and health. It has an arrangement with Drexel University College of Medicine to admit two Allegheny students who meet specific criteria (grades, MCAT scores). It has an arrangement with the William E. Simon School of Business Administration at the University of Rochester to have preferred admission to selected students by the end of their junior year. Allegheny offers cooperative 3–2 liberal arts/professional programs in engineering with Case Western Reserve University, Columbia University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Washington University in St. Louis. There is also a 3–2 Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) program reciprocal agreement with Carnegie Mellon University.

===Faculty===
Four faculty won Fulbright Awards in March 2001. Faculty sometimes focus on the local area; for example, economics professor Stephen Onyeiwu conducted a study of manufacturing in the northwestern Pennsylvania region. Ninety percent of faculty have terminal degrees in their respective fields. Books by faculty include &quot;Congressional Women&quot; and &quot;Comedy from Shakespeare to Sheridan&quot;. Faculty actively publish on a wide range of subjects from the biology of woodpeckers, to structural features of ribosomal RNA, to freshwater invertebrates. In 2018, Professor Shannan Mattiace won a Fulbright Award to teach and conduct research in Chile.

===Admissions===
There were 5,479 applications for admission to the class of 2022 (enrolling fall 2018): 3,485 were admitted (63.6%) and 474 enrolled (an admissions yield of 13.6%). The average high school GPA of enrolled freshmen was 3.51, and 35% had a high school GPA of 3.75 or higher. The middle 50% range of enrolled freshmen on SAT scores was 560–680 for reading and writing, and 560-660 for math, while the ACT Composite middle 50% range was 24–30.

===Rankings===
&quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; ranked Allegheny 60th among the top 100 U.S. liberal arts colleges for 2022.

==Student life==
===Students===
Students generally are required to live on campus for all four years, and may reside in traditional dormitories, apartment-style housing, or college-owned houses.

The demographics of students as of fall 2015 were: White (non-Hispanic) 75.9%; Hispanic/Latino 7.0%, Black (non-Hispanic) 5.9%; Two or more races 4.7%, Non-resident alien 2.8%, Asian &amp; Pacific Islander 2.4%; American Indian or Alaskan native 0.1%; Unknown 1.2% .

Allegheny students in 2008 come from 33 states and 25 other countries. Allegheny had a &quot;diversity index&quot; of .15 on a scale of .99=extremely diverse to .01=not diverse.

Students participate in volunteer activities: in the fall semester of 2011, the student body contributed 25,000 hours of volunteer service to the community. Some Allegheny students volunteered to help restore businesses in hurricane-ravished New Orleans. Residence halls and classrooms are closed during summers. An Allegheny Student Government has an active role in formulating college policy, curriculum choices, personal conduct, promoting cultural programs, and making decisions about the school&#x27;s calendar.

Information about students is generally kept private in keeping with the 1974 &quot;Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act&quot; which prohibits colleges from releasing information about their students without student permission. Accordingly, parents can not learn about their son&#x27;s or daughter&#x27;s grades unless a waiver is signed permitting release of such information. The privacy policy can sometimes lead to problems, particularly when students have mental health problems but the school is prevented legally from contacting parents. In 2002, one Allegheny student committed suicide, and his parents sued the school; a jury in 2006 found that the school was not liable or negligent. This case helped focus national attention on the competing issues of student privacy and parental rights.

Official college policy is to discourage underage drinking, although there have been incidents of violations at off-campus parties. Incoming students are required to take an online course about the dangers of alcohol abuse. The school punishes transgressions with disciplinary action.
===Media===
Students run a campus radio station WARC 90.3 FM and a publication called &quot;The Allegheny Review&quot; of undergraduate literature. The college hosts outside speakers. Allegheny has numerous student groups and organizations such as an astronomy club, a College Choir, an Outing Club, and a Peace Coalition. There are over 100 clubs and organizations offered at Allegheny. The Allegheny newspaper is called &quot;The Campus.&quot; It is distributed weekly at locations all over the college. It covers campus news, features, opinion and a wrap-up of the college sports. &quot;The Campus&quot; is entirely student-run, with an editorial board of students in charge of making all executive decisions for the publication. The Allegheny alternative magazine is called &quot;Overkill.&quot; It is tri-semester student publication distributed in unconventional locations around campus, such as in vending machines, fireplaces, and chandeliers. It features student editorials, poetry, non-fiction and fiction pieces, art, and photography with a highly distinctive design and attitude.

Allegheny has welcomed a variety of entertainers and guest speakers over the last several years including John Updike, Dave Matthews, Dick Cheney, Bill Clinton, W.D. Snodgrass, Adam Sandler, George Carlin, The Vienna Choir Boys, Rusted Root, Ben Folds, The Roots, Stephen Lynch, The Fray, Jimmy Fallon, and comedian Wayne Brady. There have been &quot;live&quot; art shows in which invited artists, over an eight-hour period, created 10-by-10-foot &quot;drawings&quot; on gallery walls while spectators watched.

===Athletics===

Allegheny, known athletically as the Gators, belongs to the Presidents&#x27; Athletic Conference (PAC) and has NCAA Division III teams. The Gators returned to the PAC in 2022 after a 38-year absence spent in the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC); the field hockey team remains in the NCAC because the PAC does not sponsor that sport. Men&#x27;s sports are baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, and track &amp; field. Women&#x27;s sports are basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball. Sports facilities include the Wise Center and the Robertson Complex. 75 percent of students play intramural sports.

Branch Rickey was Allegheny College Athletic Director from 1904 to 1905, and coached baseball, basketball, and football. Rickey also served as instructor of Shakespeare, English, and History.

The 1990 Allegheny football team, led by first-year head coach Ken O&#x27;Keefe, won the Division III football national championship with a 13–0–1 record and a 21–14 victory over in the Stagg Bowl.

=== Green Initiatives ===
Allegheny College has undertaken several projects to become more a sustainable campus. One such project is the October Energy Challenge, in which students are encouraged to save electricity for a one-month period. The difference in cost between that month and the previous month&#x27;s electrical power is then reinvested back into sustainable campus infrastructure. Previous energy challenge have resulted in the addition of water-bottle stations to encourage use of reusable water bottles and solar panels on the biology building.

Other projects include the Carrden, a student-lead garden that grows organic produce, multiple rain gardens, a green box program for reusable takeout containers, as well as the college itself becoming the first college in Pennsylvania to achieve Carbon Net-Neutrality 

There are multiple student groups dedicated to environmental protection including SEA (Students for Environmental Action), AC Food Rescue, and Creek connections.

===Traditions===
One tradition is that a female student is not a &quot;real co-ed&quot; until she&#x27;s been kissed on the &quot;thirteenth plank&quot; of the Rustic bridge over the stream. Legend states that there is a competition among residence halls during Orientation Week to steal the thirteenth plank and display it, though this rarely happens today; random students take the plank instead, with maintenance keeping a supply of replacement planks on hand.

===Fraternities and sororities===
Allegheny College also has a number of fraternities and sororities on campus. These include Kappa Kappa Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Delta Delta Delta, Alpha Delta Pi, and Alpha Chi Omega for the sororities. In 2009, 34% of Allegheny women belonged to a sorority.

<doc id="473005" wikidata="Q147772" url="?curid=473005" title="Scabiosa">
<text>Scabiosa is a genus in the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) of flowering plants. Many of the species in this genus have common names that include the word scabious, but some plants commonly known as scabious are currently classified in related genera such as &quot;Knautia&quot; and &quot;Succisa&quot;; at least some of these were formerly placed in &quot;Scabiosa&quot;. Another common name for members of this genus is pincushion flowers.

==Etymology==
The common name &#x27;scabious&#x27; comes the Latin word &quot;scabiosus&quot; meaning &#x27;mangy, rough or itchy&#x27; which refers to the herb&#x27;s traditional usage as a folk medicine to treat scabies, an illness that causes a severe itching sensation.

==Description==
Some species of &quot;Scabiosa&quot; are annuals, others perennials. Some are herbaceous plants; others have woody rootstocks. The leaves of most species are somewhat hairy and partly divided into lobes, but a few are smooth and some species have simple leaves. The flowers are borne on inflorescences in the form of heads; each head contains many small florets, each floret cupped in a membranous, saucer-shaped bract. The calyx has five sepals in the form of awns almost as long as the petals. After the flowers have dropped, the calyces together with the bracts form a spiky ball that may be the reason for the &quot;pincushion&quot; common name. The calyx is persistent and remains as a crown on the fruit after it is shed. The corolla has four to five lobes fringing a narrow funnel with a furry throat, the funnel being somewhat longer than the lobes. The florets have four stamens each, set high in the tube, and sticking out. Each fruit has just one seed.

In a few species the heads are sessile but in most species they are borne singly on a tall peduncle.

&quot;Scabiosa&quot; species and varieties differ in the colours of their flowers, but most are soft lavender blue, lilac or creamy white.

==Distribution==
Members of this genus are native to Africa, Europe and Asia. Some species of &quot;Scabiosa&quot;, notably small scabious (&quot;S. columbaria&quot;) and Mediterranean sweet scabious (&quot;S. atropurpurea&quot;) have been developed into cultivars for gardeners.

In 1782, a mysterious pale yellow scabious, called &quot;Scabiosa trenta&quot;, was described by Belsazar Hacquet, an Austrian physician, botanist, and mountaineer, in his work &quot;Plantae alpinae Carniolicae&quot;. It became a great source of inspiration for later botanists and mountaineers discovering the Julian Alps, especially Julius Kugy. The Austrian botanist Anton Kerner von Marilaun later proved Belsazar Hacquet had not found a new species, but a specimen of the already known submediterranean &quot;Cephalaria leucantha&quot;.

They are found in various habitats such as &quot;Scabiosa solymica&quot; (formerly named &quot;Lomelosia solymica&quot;), which is a &quot;chasmophyte&quot; (a plant adapted to growing in crevices or hollows) of montane, sea facing cliffs of the Tahtalı Dağı (mountain) in the western Taurus Mountains, south of Antalya, Turkey.

==Ecology==
Scabious flowers are nectar rich and attractive to many insects including butterflies and moths such as the six-spot burnet. &quot;Scabiosa&quot; species are food plants for the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera such as the grey pug moth.

<text>Uzziah (; &quot;‘Uzzīyyāhū&quot;, meaning &quot;my strength is Yah&quot;; ; ), also known as Azariah (; &quot;‘Azaryā&quot;; ; ), was the tenth king of the ancient Kingdom of Judah, and one of Amaziah&#x27;s sons. () Uzziah was 16 when he became king of Judah and reigned for 52 years. The first 24 years of his reign were as a co-regent with his father, Amaziah.

William F. Albright dates Uzziah&#x27;s reign to 783–742 BC. Edwin R. Thiele&#x27;s chronology has Uzziah becoming coregent with his father Amaziah in 792/791 BCE and sole ruler of Judah after his father&#x27;s death in 768/767 BCE. According to Jewish tradition, Uzziah was struck with tzaraath for disobeying God (, ). Thiele dates Uzziah&#x27;s being struck with tzaraath to 751/750 BCE, at which time his son Jotham took over the government, with Uzziah living on until 740/739 BCE. Pekah became king of Israel in the last year of Uzziah&#x27;s reign.

The Gospel of Matthew lists Uzziah in the genealogy of Jesus.

==Name==
Uzziah is referred to several times in the Hebrew Bible as &quot;Azariah&quot;. According to Catholic theologian James F. Driscoll, the second form of his name is most likely the result of a copyist&#x27;s error.

2 Kings mentions Azariah 8 times and Uzziah 4 times, whereas Chronicles consistently refers to Uzziah. There are many reasons for this use of multiple names for kings, but one of them is that kings used both their royal and secular names. For example, Solomon was his royal name, and his secular name at birth was Jedidiah. Uzziah is also a royal name, and Azariah is likely a personal name. Regnal names were given at the time of anointing and coronation.

==Biblical narrative==

Uzziah took the throne at age 16 and reigned for about 52 years. His reign was &quot;the most prosperous excepting that of Jehoshaphat since the time of Solomon.&quot; In the earlier part of his reign, under the influence of a prophet named Zechariah, he was faithful to God and &quot;did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord&quot; (; ). The Kings record (ib. xv. 2) states that his reign extended through fifty-two years (788–737 B.C.), and that he was righteous as his father had been, though he did not take away the high places, but allowed the people to sacrifice and burn incense at them. II Chron. xxvi. relates how Uzziah conquered the Philistines and the Arabians and received tribute from the Ammonites; how he fortified his country, reorganized and reequipped his army, and personally engaged in agricultural pursuits. His success as king, administrator, and commander-in-chief of the army made him ruler over the largest realm of Judah since the disruption of the kingdom. His power and authority over the peoples of this realm help to explain to a certain extent the political situation in the reign of Judah&#x27;s later kings, and probably also in 739, when Tiglathpileser III conquered nineteen districts in northern Syria which had belonged to Uzziah (Azri-ia-u). In Jerusalem he made machines designed by skillful men for use on the towers and on the corner defenses to shoot arrows and hurl large stones. He was a vigorous and able ruler, and &quot;his name spread abroad, even to the entrance of Egypt.&quot; ().

Uzziah&#x27;s strength became his weakness; for he attempted to usurp the power of the priesthood in burning incense in the Temple of Yhwh. He entered the Temple to burn incense on the altar of incense. Azariah the high priest saw this as an attempt to usurp the prerogatives of the priests and confronted him with a band of eighty priests, saying, &quot;It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense&quot; (). In the meantime a great earthquake shook the ground, and a rent was made in the temple, and the bright rays of the sun shone through it, and fell upon the king&#x27;s face, insomuch that the leprosy (Hebrew: &quot;tzaraath&quot;) seized upon him immediately (Josephus Flavius, &quot;Antiquities&quot; IX 10:4). Uzziah was suddenly struck with leprosy before he had offered the incense (), and he was driven from the Temple and compelled to reside in &quot;a separate house&quot; until his death (, 27; ). The government was turned over to his son Jotham (), a coregency that lasted for the last 11 years of Uzziah&#x27;s life (751/750 to 740/739 BC). The total number of years, fifty-two, attributed to Uzziah&#x27;s reign include the period from his accession to his death.

He was buried in a separate grave &quot;in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings&quot; (; ).

===Biblical references===
* The Book of Isaiah uses &quot;the year that king Uzziah died&quot; as a reference point for describing the vision in which Isaiah sees the Lord of Hosts ().
* The Book of Amos dates its words as being received when &quot;Uzziah was king of Judah&quot; (Amos 1.1).
* Another Uzziah, a Simeonite, son of Micah, is mentioned as the first of the city magistrates in Bethulia, Judith&#x27;s town in the apocryphal Book of Judith.

==Archaeology==
Archaeological findings from Mesopotamia—in the form of Assyrian correspondence and administrative texts discovered at Nimrud and sculptures from the royal palaces of Nineveh—indicate close ties between Assyria and Judah between the reigns of Uzziah and Manasseh and are evidence that Uzziah was contemporary with Tiglath-Pileser III. A highly fragmentary portion attributed to Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s annals mention the king &quot;Azaria&#x27;u&quot; of &quot;Ya&#x27;uda&quot;, seemingly &quot;Azariah of Judah&quot;, which some have stated is a reference to Uzziah; however, Nadav Na&#x27;aman showed the fragment actually belongs to the time of Sennacherib and refers not to Azariah but to Hezekiah. In Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s annals there are two references to an Azariah, but neither of these make any reference to his country being Judah, making an identification with the biblical figure dubious.

Uzziah&#x27;s name appears in two unprovenanced iconic stone seals discovered in 1858 and 1863. The first is inscribed &quot;l’byw ‘bd / ‘zyw&quot;, &quot;[belonging] to ’Abiyah, minister of ‘Uziyah&quot;, and the second (rev.) &quot;lšbnyw ‘ / bd ‘zyw&quot;, &quot;[belonging] to Shubnayah, minister of ‘Uziyah.&quot; Despite being of unprovenanced origin, they are the first authentic contemporary attestations to the ancient king.

===Uzziah Tablet===

In 1931, an archaeological find known as the Uzziah Tablet was discovered by Professor E. L. Sukenik of the Hebrew University. He came across the artifact in the collection of the Russian Convent of the Ascension on the Mount of Olives, put together by the convent&#x27;s founder, Archimandrite Antonin Kapustin. The provenance of the tablet previous to this is unknown and was not documented by the convent. The strongest theory as to its origin comes from a medieval Jewish source that locates the tomb of Uzziah on the modern site of the convent, which suggests that the tablet might have been discovered during the construction of the convent in the 1870s. The inscription on the tablet is written in an Aramaic dialect very similar to Biblical Aramaic. According to its script, it is dated to around 30–70 CE, around 700 years after the supposed death of Uzziah of 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles. Nevertheless, the inscription is translated, &quot;Hither were brought the bones of Uzziah, king of Judah. Not to be opened.&quot; Accordingly, it may be that there was a later reburial of Uzziah during the Second Temple period.

===Earthquake in the days of Uzziah===

A major earthquake is referred to in the book of the prophet Amos. Amos dates his prophecy to &quot;two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam II son of Jehoash was king of Israel&quot; (Amos 1:1, NIV). Over 200 years later, the prophet Zechariah predicted a future earthquake from which the people would flee as they fled in the days of Uzziah (Zechariah 14:5). Geologists believe they have found evidence of this major earthquake in sites throughout Israel and Jordan. The geologists write: Masonry walls best display the earthquake, especially walls with broken ashlars, walls with displaced rows of stones, walls still standing but leaning or bowed, and walls collapsed with large sections still lying course-on-course. Debris at six sites (Hazor, Deir &#x27;Alla, Gezer, Lachish, Tell Judeideh, and &#x27;En Haseva) is tightly confined stratigraphically to the middle of the 8th-century B.C., with dating errors of ~30 years. ... The earthquake was at least magnitude 7.8, but likely was 8.2. ... This severe geologic disaster has been linked historically to a speech delivered at the city of Bethel by a shepherd-farmer named Amos of Tekoa.&quot;

An exact date for this earthquake would be of considerable interest to archaeologists and historians, because it would allow a synchronization of the earthquake at all the sites affected by it in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Currently, the stratigraphic evidence at Gezer dates the earthquake at 760 BC, plus or minus 25 years, while Yadin and Finkelstein date the earthquake level at Hazor to 760 BC based on stratigraphic analysis of the destruction debris. Similarly, Ussishkin dates the &quot;sudden destruction&quot; level at Lachish to approximately 760 BC. A 2019 &quot;Haaretz&quot; report by geologists studying layers of sediment on the floor of the Dead Sea further confirms the occurrence of this particular seismic event.

Amos says that the earthquake was in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and Jeroboam (II), son of Jehoash king of Israel. The reference to Jeroboam II is helpful in restricting the date of Amos&#x27; vision, more so than the reference to Uzziah&#x27;s long reign of 52 years. According to Thiele&#x27;s widely accepted chronology, Jeroboam II began a coregency with his father in 793/792, became sole regent in 782/781, and died in late summer or the fall of 753 BC. Assuming that the prophecy took place after Uzziah became sole regent in 768/767, Amos&#x27; prophecy can be dated to some time after that and some time before Jeroboam&#x27;s death in 753 BC, with the earthquake two years after that. These dates are consistent with the dates given by the archaeologists above for the earthquake. They are inconsistent with the tradition, found in Josephus and the Talmud but not in the Bible, that the earthquake occurred when Uzziah entered the Temple to offer incense, accepting that the beginning of the Uzziah/Jotham coregency began sometime in the six-month period after Nisan 1 of 750 BC.

===Further chronological notes===
The calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. For Uzziah, the Scriptural data allow the narrowing of the beginning of his sole reign to some time between Nisan 1 of 767 BCE and the day before Tishri 1 of the same year.

Some writers object to the use of coregencies in determining the dates of the kings of Judah and Israel, saying that there should be explicit reference to coregencies if they existed. Since there is no word for &quot;coregency&quot; in Biblical Hebrew, an explicit mention using this word is not found. Coregencies are well attested in Egypt, and in giving the year of their reign, the timelines of the pharaohs do not relate whether it is measured from a coregency. Egyptologists must determine the existence of a coregency from a comparison of chronological data, just as Thiele and those who have followed him have done from the chronological data of Scripture.

In the case of Uzziah, however, the statement that after he was stricken with leprosy, his son Jotham had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land () is a fairly straightforward indication of what in modern terms is called a coregency. Also there must have been a coregency in the beginning of Uzziah reign, as the bible states he became king in the 27th year of Jerobeam II, his father Amaziah ruled for 29 years. Amaziah is said to have become king in the second year of Joash from Israel, who ruled for 16 years, so Amaziah&#x27;s death should then have been in de 14 year of Jerobeam II, creating a gap of more than a decade that can only be filled by coregencies, with years counted including coregencies (as done in Egypt).

Not all of the coregencies for the kings of Judah and Israel are as easy to identify as the Uzziah/Jotham coregency indicated by 2 Kings 15:5, but those who ignore coregencies in constructing the history of this time have failed to produce any chronology for the period that has found widespread acceptance. After noting how David set a pattern by setting his son Solomon on the throne before his death, Nadav Na&#x27;aman wrote, &quot;When taking into account the permanent nature of the co-regency in Judah from the time of Joash, one may dare to conclude that dating the co-regencies accurately is indeed the key for solving the problems of biblical chronology in the eighth century BC&quot;.

The dates given in the infobox above are those of Thiele, except the starting date for the Amaziah/Uzziah coregency is taken as one year later than that given by Thiele, following Leslie McFall. This implies that Uzziah&#x27;s 52 years are to be taken in a non-accession sense, which was Thiele&#x27;s general practice for coregencies, but which he did not follow in the case of Uzziah.

<text>Hans Jørgensen Wegner (April 2, 1914 – January 26, 2007) was a Danish furniture designer. His work, along with a concerted effort from several of his manufacturers, contributed to the international popularity of mid-century Danish design. His style is often described as Organic Functionality, a modernist school with emphasis on functionality. This school of thought arose primarily in Scandinavian countries with contributions by Poul Henningsen, Alvar Aalto, and Arne Jacobsen.

Wegner has been referred to as the &quot;King of Chairs&quot; for his proliferated work designing seating. In his lifetime he designed over 500 different chairs, over 100 of which were put into mass production and many of which have become recognizable design icons.

Wegner received several major design prizes in his lifetime, from the Lunning Prize in 1951 and the Grand Prix of the Milan Triennale in the same year, to the Prince Eugen Medal in Sweden and the Danish Eckersberg Medal. In 1969, he was made honorary Royal designer for industry by the Royal Society of Arts in London.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Wegner was born to cobbler Peter Mathiesen Wegner and Nicoline Lausen on Smedegade 12 in Tønder. At an early age, Wegner showed interest in craft and could draw and create paper cuttings before he learned to walk. At home, Wegner was drawn to woodcarving and created wood sculptures based on Royal Copenhagen figurines he saw at the Tønder Museum.
At the age of 14, he worked as a child apprentice to master cabinetmaker H. F. Stahlberg. He soon discovered he had a feeling for wood and developed an affinity towards the material. At the age of 15, he made his first chair. Finishing his apprenticeship at 17, he crafted a lady&#x27;s desk as part of his journeyman&#x27;s test and remained employed in the workshop before joining the army.

During the army, he first saw the exhibition of the Copenhagen Cabinetmakers&#x27; Guild in 1935. The exhibits were a laboratory for experimentation between Master Cabinetmakers (such as Johannes Hansen, L. Pontoppidan, Niels Vodder, Jacob Kjær, and A. J. Iversen) and the best architects of the time (such as Kaare Klint, Vilhelm Lauritzen, and Ole Wanscher). These exhibits gave Wegner a first-hand experience of what the combination of workmanship and design could produce. Wegner decided to become a designer with the aim of producing and selling his furniture.

Wegner realized his skills needed improvement if he wished to fulfill his dream of opening his own workshop. After the military, Wegner took a 2.5 month cabinetmaking course at the Danish Technological Institute. Subsequently, he attended the School of Arts and Crafts&#x27; carpentry program located within the Danish Museum of Art &amp; Design in Copenhagen. Wegner was led by the instruction of Orla Mølgaard-Nielsen, a student from Klint&#x27;s school, and he was strongly influenced by functionalism. Wegner garnered attention at school from his teachers for his developed drawing skills. His painting teacher tried to convince him to pursue a career as a portrait painter.

He participated at his first Cabinetmakers&#x27; Guild exhibition in 1938, where he presented the Stangerup Chair - named after the person who purchased it.

=== Early career in Aarhus ===

In 1938, Wegner took a one-year leave from his studies to work on the Aarhus City Hall project on the recommendation of his teacher. Arne Jacobsen and Erik Møller had won a bid to design the Aarhus City Hall and employed Wegner to create the furniture. However, World War II caused delays in the City Hall project and he was first assigned to work on the under Møller and Flemming Lassen. Today, the library displays early photos of Wegner&#x27;s contributions to the library as well as a website dedicated to the historic design. While the library was well-received and Møller and Lassen were awarded the Eckersberg Medal, Wegner&#x27;s contributions weren&#x27;t as widely publicized at the time. From 1939-1942, Wegner worked on the Aarhus City Hall project and was responsible for all the furnishings. Wegner began working on three lines of modular office furniture for Planmøbler while working on the City Hall. Some of the Planmøbler furniture was used in the office wings of the City Hall. In 1940, Wegner made what could be called the two most pivotal relationships in his life. The first one was a personal relationship. He met Inga Helbo, a secretary in Jacobsen&#x27;s office, and they were married on November 9, 1940. The second relationship was professional. Orla Mølgaard-Nielsen played another vital role in Wegner&#x27;s life by connecting him with master cabinetmaker Johannes Hansen.

After finishing the Aarhus City Hall project, Wegner was unable to return to Copenhagen due to travel restrictions during Nazi occupation. Wegner never did return to school to complete the carpentry program and, as a result, he never received instruction from the &quot;father of Danish modern furniture design&quot; Kaare Klint (who taught the final part of the program). He continued to work for Jacobsen until 1943 when he opened an independent studio in Aarhus. He designed for Mikael Laursen during this time. He was later employed by his classmate Børge Mogensen, who was the head of furniture design for FDB Møbler (a division of the Danish cooperative FDB). 

In 1944, Wegner created the Peter&#x27;s Chair (CH410). Wegner was looking for a christening gift for Børge Mogensen&#x27;s son, Peter, but he was unable to find one because resources were limited under Nazi occupation. Instead, Wegner designed a children&#x27;s chair himself. The chair was composed of four pieces that fit together like a three-dimensional puzzle, without the need for any adhesive or fasteners. Impressed with the design, Mogensen put the chair into production and sold it at FDB. The chair and an accompanying table that Wegner later designed are still in production today under Carl Hansen &amp; Søn.

For Johannes Hansen&#x27;s booth in the 1944 Cabinetmakers&#x27; Guild exhibition, Wegner created what might be considered his most decorative and most laborious piece: the Fish Cabinet. The exterior of the cabinet followed Kaare Klint&#x27;s strict functional style with a rational geometric shape and little decorative elements. The interior, however, is an elaborate display of an underwater scene. Due to its technically demanding intarsia design, Johannes Hansen would not agree to produce the cabinet. Wegner decided to produce it himself using a pocket knife, which took three weeks to assemble all of the roughly 3,000 pieces of wood.

Wegner would only complete a few items for FDB Møbler before he was recruited by one of FDB&#x27;s subcontractors, Fritz Hansen. He created the China Chair series for Fritz Hansen in 1944. While living in Aarhus, Wegner spent much of his time at the library where he learned about different furniture movements and styles. He saw a Chinese chair in a book by Ole Wanscher that served as inspiration for this chair series. Two of the four China Chairs would go into production. 

=== Return to Copenhagen and international success ===
Wegner returned to Copenhagen in 1946 where he accepted a teaching position at the Danish School of Arts and Crafts at Mølgaard-Nielsen&#x27;s suggestion. Wegner also worked for Palle Suenson&#x27;s studio while teaching, where he was primarily responsible for renovating and designing furniture for the M/S Venus, a ship which had been damaged by the Germans during the occupation.

In 1947, Wegner designed the Peacock Chair for Johannes Hansen.Wegner began to experiment with molded plywood in 1948. Plywood had become popularized as a furniture material by the Eames and Alvar Alto and many designers were drawn to use this new lamination technology. That year, he submitted designs for a plywood chair in the MoMA&#x27;s International Competition for Low Cost Furniture Design. His first shell chair (FH1936) as well as a bench version (FH1935) went into production for Fritz Hansen that same year.

Wegner&#x27;s two most notable works, the Round Chair and the Wishbone chair, both came in 1949. That year, Wegner presented three chairs for the annual exhibition of the Copenhagen Cabinetmakers&#x27; Guild while employed by Johannes Hansen: a three-part (tripartite) plywood shell chair, the Folding Chair, and the Round Chair. The Danish press that attended the event initially paid attention to the tripartite chair. While the tripartite chair had captured the attention of the Danish press, American journalists attended the event for the first time and were drawn to the Round Chair. The American journalists shared the news of this chair back home and it became was the subject of much attention internationally. The American magazine &quot;Interiors&quot; featured the chair in their piece on the event and christened it “most beautiful chair in the world.” This was the first coverage of Danish Modern in the American press.

That same year, Wegner also created the Wishbone Chair. Carl Hansen &amp; Søn commissioned Wegner to create a chair that was both high quality and able to be mass produced. Wegner presented 4 chairs designs for Carl Hansen: CH22, CH23, the Wishbone Chair (CH24), and CH25. While all the chairs went into production the following year, the Wishbone Chair became his greatest commercial success and has remained in continuous production. 

In 1951, Ejvind Kold Kristensen created Salesco A/S, a company that exclusively promoted Wegner&#x27;s work both domestically and abroad. Seeing the large potential for commercial success abroad, Salesco was a partnership between five of Wegner&#x27;s preferred manufacturers, each with their own specialty, that would benefit from the shared marketing and sales resources to bring Wegner&#x27;s works to more customers. The five manufacturers were Ry Møbler made bookcases, desks, and bulky items; A.P. Stolen made large upholstered furniture; Getama made furniture with loose cushions; Andreas Tuck made tables; and Carl Hansen &amp; Søn made chairs. The company would allow Wegner to produce works across many factories at mass production and not be dependent on annual exhibits to market his works. With this centralized business, international purchasers only needed to visit a single showroom on Rygårds Alle in Copenhagen to see all of Wegner&#x27;s Salesco collection. This organization made in possible for Wegner&#x27;s work to proliferate without the designer having to worry about the production and export networks.

In 1951, Wegner won the inaugural Lunning Prize along with Finnish designer Tapio Wirkkala. The prize money allowed Wegner and his wife to take a three-month study tour to the United States and Mexico. The couple took the trip in 1953 after their two daughters were old enough to stay with their grandparents. Wegner witnessed the industrialized furniture production of the US but preferred to adhere to Denmark&#x27;s traditional methods and rejected multiple offers, including one from Raymond Loewy, to move his furniture production to the US. Wegner stayed with Edgar Kaufmann Jr. at Fallingwater during the trip.

In 1959, Frederik Lunning hosted a retrospective of Wegner&#x27;s work at Georg Jensen in New York.

Ten years after its initial release, the Round Chair became the subject to even greater attention and more accolades when chosen for the seating of the first televised U.S. presidential debate between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy on September 26, 1960.

From 1962-1963, Wegner works with architects Allan Jessen and Arne Karlsen on designing his family home and design studio in Gentofte.

=== Supplier issues and decline in popularity ===
US imports of Wegner&#x27;s furniture declined in the late 1960s due to an ill-fated deal with Georg Jensen, Inc (the New York agency for Georg Jensen and a premier retailer for Danish home goods). In this agreement, Salesco gave Georg Jensen exclusive distribution rights within the United States. Georg Jensen added a hefty premium on all of Wegner&#x27;s furniture which frustrated interior designers who balked at paying 3-4 times the retail prices in Denmark. When Georg Jensen shuttered in 1968, the US was left without a distributor for Salesco&#x27;s five manufacturers. Johannes Hansen was not a member of the organization and was unaffected by this.

The issues with the Georg Jensen deal were happening in the backdrop of a much larger and looming issue facing Danish furniture imports. In the late 1960s through the 1990s, Danish furniture suffered from an exhausted international market, a surge in low quality furniture from Denmark that lessened its allure, and rampant plagiarism from abroad. The Newer trends like bean bags, Eero Aarnio&#x27;s Ball Chair from Finland, and the Memphis Group&#x27;s colorful furniture from Italy were now seen as more appealing. In addition to changes in style preferences, customers&#x27; shopping habits had changed to favor affordable and lower-cost furniture over a single investment that would last their lifetime.

In 1969, the Knoll furniture company acquired the U.S. distribution rights for the Wegner designs manufactured by Johannes Hansen in Copenhagen. The collection included over a dozen chairs and a cabinet design.

A New York Times article noted &quot;[Danish furniture] went out of style. [...] After being widely acclaimed and acquired, it was copied and cheapened and then replaced by those whose business is marketable novelty and change.&quot; The furniture industry in Denmark suffered greatly. The Cabinetmakers&#x27; Guild Exhibition, which Wegner presented new designed with Johannes Hansen, held its final event in 1966 after too few cabinetmakers remained in Copenhagen to sustain it. Wegner&#x27;s furniture manufacturers fared better than others during this time but many eventually closed down: Andreas Tuck closed in 1972, A.P. Stolen went bankrupt in 1974, and Johannes Hansen would close in the 1990s.The Salesco collaboration with Wegner would collapse in 1969. There are differing opinions on what led to this breaking point. In a book published by Carl Hansen &amp; Søn on their corporate history, the author attributes Wegner&#x27;s dissatisfaction to Salesco managing director Henning Foss-Pedersen&#x27;s attempt to influence what products Wegner designed and dictate which manufacturers got assigned to new designs. In the biography on the founder of PP Møbler, the breakdown is also attributed to rivalries between the five manufacturers and that Salesco started to work with other designers. Wegner gave the Salesco board of directors an ultimatum: choose him or Foss-Pedersen. Salesco chose Foss-Pedersen due to a very large severance package in his contract. Wegner vowed he would never again set foot in any of the Salesco companies; the companies would continue to manufacture any existing designs items but Wegner would not create new furniture for them. Wegner kept his promise and never worked with any of these companies again. To further distance the company from its former collaborator, Salesco updated their logo to feature an &quot;S&quot; instead of Wegner&#x27;s initials.

Getama left Salesco before the falling out. Wegner initially took Salesco&#x27;s side and told a newspaper that it would be difficult to continue to work with Getama. However, Wegner changed course after he parted with Salesco and continued to produce furniture for Getama. Getama and Wegner saw continued success in their residence halls furniture series designed for Denmark&#x27;s growing university population.

=== Later years and revival ===
After the fallout with Salesco, Wegner became more attached to PP Møbler. PP Møbler was a supplier to A.P. Stolen but didn&#x27;t produce furniture under its own name. From 1962 to 1968, Wegner used PP Møbler workshop to create prototypes and experiments; when successful, the designs would go into production with other manufacturers like Getama and A.P. Stolen. In 1969, he urged the company to produce under its own brand name and his first chair especially for PP Møbler (PP201). Wegner also designed their logo. As Wegner&#x27;s other manufacturers closed down, he moved production of many pieces originally designed for Andreas Tuck, A.P. Stolen, and Johannes Hansen to PP Møbler.

Wegner&#x27;s later work under PP Møbler took a distinctive turn from his earlier designs. His chairs began to look more Scandinavian, functionalist, and Apollonian. He started using lighter colored woods as foreign and exotic woods became less appealing to consumers. To appeal to consumers interests, many of Wegner&#x27;s early designs PP inherited were released in lighter woods (like maple) instead of the darker woods (like teak) with which the designs were originally produced. A signature characteristic of many chairs created for PP Møbler is a light wood chair with an inlay of darker wood in the top rail. This can be seen in the PP201, PP62, PP63, and PP701.

Wegner hired his daughter Marianne, who was also a designer, to work at his design studio in 1973. In 1975, they collaborated on creating a streetlamp for a Louis Poulsen design competition. The lamp, informally called the Wegner Lamp (Danish: &quot;Wegner lygten&quot;), won first place in the competition and can be found today around Tønder, Denmark.

In 1978, DFDS commissioned Wegner and PP Møbler to create 800 chairs for the Dana Anglia ferry. The resulting chair (PP52/PP62 or the &quot;Ferry Chair&quot;) has been regarded for its remarkable durability. In 1982, someone contacted PP Møbler for a replacement seat after they found a PP52 chair washed up on the west coast of Denmark. It turned out to be the version made exclusively for the ferry. Even though the chair had fallen off the ferry and traveled through the North Sea, the frame remained intact and only required a new seat.

In the late 1990s, Danish modern and the broader Mid century modern movement experienced a revival in international interest. Wegner, like many designers of the period, saw a surge of renewed interest in their work. Wegner&#x27;s furniture was now in such demand that he was cited as &quot;the man of the hour in a hot collecting market&quot; in a 1998 New York Times article.

=== Retirement and legacy ===
As Wegner got older, his health started declining and he withdrew from work. Wegner retired in 1993 and his daughter Marianne took over his studio. Marianne said of Wegner&#x27;s retirement, &quot;Towards the end of the 1980s, I could feel that my father&#x27;s energy level was faltering...but I was there to help out. I took on more and more tasks along the way. [...] He continued to draw some furniture until 1993, but after that, he couldn&#x27;t really concentrate on the work anymore and he also had trouble walking down the stairs to the drawing room.&quot; He was placed in a nursing home in 2001 and started using a wheelchair.

In August 1995, Museum Sønderjylland opened a permanent exhibit of Wegner&#x27;s work in the . Wegner gifted 36 chairs for display on the exhibit which he felt comprised his best work. 
On January 26, 2007, Wegner passed away at the age of 92. In Wegner&#x27;s own lifetime he was able to witness a surge of renewed interest in his work. PP Møbler and Marianne Wegner worked together to create an engraved oak headstone for his gravesite at Mariebjerg Cemetery in Gentofte.

To mark the 100 year anniversary of Wegner&#x27;s birth in 2014, a series of events took place to commemorate the artist. Designmuseum Danmark opened the &quot;Just One Good Chair&quot; exhibition to showcase a retrospective of Wegner&#x27;s work, as well as published an accompanying book in English, Danish, and German. The Art Museum in Tønder put on the &quot;Hans J Wegner: A Nordic Design Icon from Tønder&quot; exhibition, with an accompanying book of the same name in Danish and English. The Art Museum in Tønder also released &quot;Hans, His Chairs and The World,&quot; a children’s book about Wegner&#x27;s life. Post Danmark issued a commemorative stamp.

A number of Wegner&#x27;s furniture was put into production in 2014 to mark Wegner&#x27;s 100th birthday. PP Møbler released the Upholstered Peacock Chair (PP550) and Hammock Chair (PP135) and put the Tub Chair (PP530) into production for the first time. Carl Hansen &amp; Søn released the CH88 chair and CH825 credenza.

Art Museum in Tønder and Tønder Municipality created the Wegner Prize in 2015 to recognize designers or institutions that have contributed to Wegner&#x27;s memory or the development of Nordic design. Winners of the prize include Noritsugu Oda, Aarhus City Hall, Cabinetmakers’ Autumn Exhibition, and PP Møbler, Getama, and Carl Hansen &amp; Søn.

In February 2020, a group formed the Association for the establishment of a Museum for Hans J. Wegner (Danish: &quot;Foreningen til etablering af et museum for Hans J. Wegners møbelkunst&quot;) to explore creating an entire museum dedicated to Wegner in Tønder. The association plans to spend up to three years investigating the feasibility and seeking grants to bring the idea to life. Wegner&#x27;s family has been supportive and offered up items from his design studio to display at the museum.

== Personal style and design characteristics ==

=== Use of wood ===
Almost all of Wegner&#x27;s creations are made of wood. Having worked with wood from an early age and being trained as a cabinetmaker, the designer was very attached to this material. In addition to wood, Wegner also utilized other traditional construction materials like upholstery, caning, and paper cord. His style is known for taking traditional elements and pushing them to extreme tolerances and distillations. Unlike his contemporaries, Wegner did not focus on materials like fiberglass and plastics (Verner Panton), steel (Poul Kjaerholm), or polyurethane foam (Arne Jacobsen).

While Wegner preferred wood, he occasionally designed chairs that would not be possible with wood. For the Circle Chair (PP130), Wegner originally designed it with a steel ring because such a method for making the large ring from wood wasn&#x27;t available in 1965, however, when it was finally put into production in 1985, PP Møbler was able to make it entirely from wood.

=== Variations on a theme ===

Wegner often drew upon his own designs to create new chairs. Many of Wegner&#x27;s chairs borrow characteristics from his prior works. The danish art critic Henrik Sten Møller named his 1979 book on Wegner &quot;Tema Med Variationer&quot; (English: &quot;Variations on a theme&quot;) after Wegner&#x27;s tendency to return to earlier works and evolve them.

The Chinese Chair was created in 4 different versions. Later, the Wishbone Chair was based on the early Chinese Chair series. The Cow Horn Chair and Swivel Chair can trace their curved back to the Round Chair.

=== Adherence to traditional craftsmanship ===
Wegner said of his work, &quot;I have always wanted to make unexceptional things of an exceptionally high quality.&quot; Many of Wegner&#x27;s wooden chairs are characterized by traditional joinery techniques including mortise and tenons, finger joints, and sculpted elements such as armrests and seat supports. In the early models of the Round Chair, Wegner used a mortise and tenon joint to connect the arms at the middle of the backrest. Wegner was dissatisfied with the way that this looked and wrapped the backrest in cane to hide what he considered to be an unsightly design. Unhappy with this compromise and the deceptive illusion that the arms and backrest were constructed from a single piece of wood, Wegner later updated the design to use a zigzag patterned finger joint to connect the three parts. In the Peacock chair, the connection of the legs to the seat is accentuated by the use of a darker wood wedge in the mortise and tenon joint. These features emphasize the process involved in bringing the furniture together and help inform the user of the craftsmanship employed in his work.

=== Homage to historical works ===
In addition to an adherence to traditional craftsmanship, many of Wegner&#x27;s pieces also paid homage to historical and traditional chairs. This can be seen in Peacock Chair which is based on a classic windsor chair and the Chinese Chair series which was inspired by Ming dynasty chair design. Wegner described his approach as &quot;stripping the old chairs of their outer style and letting them appear in their pure construction.&quot;

<doc id="473019" wikidata="Q270273" url="?curid=473019" title="Lutetia">
<text>Lutetia, ( , ; ) also known as &#x27; and &#x27; ( ; ; ), was a Gallo–Roman town and the predecessor of modern-day Paris. Traces of an earlier Neolithic settlement () have been found nearby, and a larger settlement was established around the middle of the third century BC by the Parisii, a Gallic tribe. The site was an important crossing point of the Seine, the intersection of land and water trade routes.

In the first century BC, the settlement was conquered by Romans and a city began to be built. Remains of the Roman forum, amphitheatre, aqueduct and baths can still be seen. In the fifth century it became the capital of the Merovingian dynasty of French kings, and thereafter was known as Paris.

Many artifacts from Lutetia have been recovered and are on display at the Musée Carnavalet.

==Etymology==

The settlement is attested in Ancient Greek as &quot;Loukotokía&quot; (Λoυκoτοκία) by Strabo and &quot;Leukotekía&quot; (Λευκοτεκία) by Ptolemy. Likely origins are Celtic root &quot;lut-&quot; meaning &quot;a swamp or marsh&quot; + suffix &quot;-ecia&quot;, It survives today in the Scottish Gaelic &quot;lòn&quot; (&quot;pool, meadow&quot;) and the Breton &quot;loudour&quot; (&quot;dirty&quot;).

A less likely origin is the Celtic root , which means &quot;mouse&quot; and &quot;-ek(t)ia&quot;, double collective suffix, meaning &quot;the mice&quot; and which is contained in the Breton word &quot;logod&quot;, the Welsh &quot;llygod&quot; &quot;mice&quot;, and the Irish &quot;luch&quot;, genitive &quot;luchad&quot; &quot;mouse&quot;.

==History==
=== Earliest inhabitants ===
Traces of Neolithic habitations, dating as far back as 4500 BC, have been found along the Seine at Bercy, and close to the Louvre. The earliest inhabitants lived on the river plain, raising animals and farming. In the Bronze Age and Iron Age, they settled in villages, in houses made of wood and clay. Their life was closely attached to the river, which served as a trade route to other parts of Europe.

===The Gallic settlement===

The original location of the early capital of the Parisii is still disputed by historians. They had traditionally placed the main settlement on the Île de la Cité, where the bridges of the major trading routes of the Parisii crossed the Seine. This view was challenged after the discovery between 1994 and 2005 of a large early Gallic settlement in Nanterre, in the suburbs of Paris. This is composed of a large area of several main streets and hundreds of houses over 15 hectares. Critics also point out the lack of archaeological finds from the pre-Roman era on the Ile de la Cité.

Other scholars dispute the idea that the settlement was in Nanterre. They point to the description given by Julius Caesar, who came to Lutetia to negotiate with the leaders of the Gallic tribes. He wrote that the &quot;oppidum&quot; which he visited was on an island. In his account of the war in Gaul Caesar wrote that, when the Romans later laid siege to Lutetia, &quot;the inhabitants had burned their structures and the wooden bridges which served to cross the two branches of the river around their island fortress,&quot; which appears to describe the Île de la Cité.

Proponents of the Ile de Cité as the site of the Gallic settlement also address the issue of the lack of archaeological evidence on the island. The original oppidum and bridges were burned by the Parisii to keep them out of the hands of the Romans. The houses of the Parisii were made of wood and clay. Since then every square metre of the island has been dug up and rebuilt, often using the same materials, multiple times, making it unlikely that traces of the Gallic settlement would remain on the island. They argue that a settlement in Nanterre did not necessarily exclude that the Île-de-la-Cité was the site of the oppidum of Lutetia; both settlements could have existed at the same time. Finally, they argue that, while Gallic settlements sometimes relocated to a new site, the new sites were usually given a new name. It would be very unusual to transfer the name of Lutetia from the Nanterre settlement to a new Roman town on the Île-de-la-Cité. They also argue that if Lutetia had not already existed where Paris is today, the new Roman city would have been given a Latin, not a Gallic name. This seems to support the argument that Lutetia was in fact located at the center of modern Paris.

The Parisii first agreed to submit to Caesar and Rome, but in 52 BC they joined other tribes, led by Vercingetorix, in a revolt near the end of Julius Caesar&#x27;s Gallic Wars, the Battle of Lutetia was fought with the local tribe. The Gallic forces were led by Vercingetorix&#x27;s lieutenant Camulogenus. They burned the oppidum and the bridges to keep the Romans from crossing. The Romans, led by Titus Labienus, one of Caesar&#x27;s generals, marched south to Melun, crossed the river there, marched back toward the city, and decisively defeated the Parisii. The location of the final battle, like the location of the oppidum, is disputed. It was fought near a river, which some historians interpret as the Seine, and others as the Yonne; and near a large marsh; a feature of the countryside near both the Île-de-la-Cité and Narbonne. Whatever its location was, the battle was decisive; Lutetia became a Roman town.

=== Roman Lutetia ===
The first traces of the Roman occupation of Lutetia appeared at the end of the 1st century BC, during the reign of the Emperor Augustus. By the beginning of the 1st century AD, the construction of the Roman city was underway.

The Roman city was laid out along the main Cardo Maximus street, perpendicular to the Seine. It began at the heights of the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève on the left bank, went downhill along the modern Rue Saint-Jacques, across a marshy area to the bridge connecting to the Île de la Cité; across the island, and across a bridge to a smaller enclave on the right bank. The low-lying land along the river was suitable for farming; and since it was easily flooded, the road was raised. The Cardo Maximus met the Decumanus, or main east-west street, located at modern rue Soufflot. Here was the civic basilica, containing a tribunal, and a temple. Gradually the city was furnished with a forum, and baths, all on the upper slope of Mount Sainte-Genevieve.

It was not the capital of the Roman province (Sens had that distinction) and it was to the west of the most important Roman north-south road between Provence and the Rhine. The importance of the city was due in large part to its position as an intersection of land and water trade routes. One of the most striking archeological finds from the early period is the Pillar of the Boatmen which was erected by the corporation of local river merchants and sailors and dedicated to Tiberius.

Other major public works projects and monuments were built in the 2nd century AD including an aqueduct.

In the 3rd century, according to legend, Christianity was brought to the town by St Denis, and his companions Rusticus and Eleuthere. In about 250 he and two companions were said to have been arrested and decapitated on the hill of &quot;Mons Mercurius&quot; thereafter known as &quot;Mons Martyrum&quot; (Martyrs&#x27; Hill, or Montmartre). According to tradition, he carried his head to Saint-Denis, where the Basilica of Saint-Denis was later built.

The mid third century brought a series of invasions of Gaul by two Germanic peoples, the Franks and the Alemanni, which threatened Lutetia. The city at the time had no fortifications. Portions of the left bank settlement, including the baths and amphitheatre, were hurriedly abandoned, and the stones used to construct ramparts around the Île de la Cité. The city was reduced in size from one hundred hectares during the high Roman Empire to ten to fifteen hectares on the left bank, and ten hectares on the Île de la Cité. A new civic basilica and baths were built on the island whose vestiges can be seen in the archeological crypt under the Parvis in front of Notre-Dame Cathedral, Place John Paul II. 

In the 4th century, Lutetia remained an important bulwark defending the Empire against the Germanic invaders. In 357–358 Julian, as &quot;caesar&quot; of the Western empire and general of the Gallic legions, moved the Roman capital of Gaul from Trier to Paris. After defeating the Alemanni in a major battle of Strasbourg in 357, he defended against Germanic invaders coming from the north. He was proclaimed emperor by his troops in 360 in Lutetia. Later Valentinian I resided in Lutetia for a brief period (365–366). The first documented bishop of Paris was Victorinus, in 346. The first council of Bishops in Gaul convened in the city in 360. When Saint Martin visited the city in 360, there was a cathedral, near the site of Notre-Dame de Paris.

The end of the Roman Empire in the west, and the creation of the Merovingian dynasty in the 5th century, with its capital placed in Paris by Clovis I, confirmed the new role and name for the city. The adjective &quot;Parisiacus&quot; had already been used for centuries. Lutetia had gradually become Paris, the city of the Parisii.

==The City==
=== The Forum of Lutetia ===
The Forum of Lutetia was in the centre of the city, between the modern streets of Boulevard Saint-Michel on the west, Rue Saint-Jacques on the east, rue Cujas to the north and Rue G. Lussac and rue Malbranch to the south. It was two Roman blocks wide and one block long, 177.6 x 88.8 m. Only a small part of a wall of the old forum remains above ground today, but the foundations have been extensively excavated since the 19th century.

The forum was surrounded by a wall, with entrances on the north and south. Along the outer walls on the north, south sides and west sides, were arcades sheltering rows of small shops. At the west end was an underground gallery, or cryptoporticus.

The civic basilica, essentially the town hall, occupied the east of the forum, It contained the courts where political, social and financial issues were discussed and decided. It had a central nave, higher than other parts of the building, and two lower collateral aisles, separated from the nave by rows of columns.

At the west end was the temple devoted to the official gods. Its facade with a portico of pillars with triangular pediment faced to the east, the tradition for Roman temples.

=== The Amphitheatre, or Arenes de Lutece ===
The amphitheatre is located near the intersection of Rue Monge and Rue de Navarre. It was about 100 x 130 m in plan, making it one of the largest in Gaul. It could accommodate as many as 17000 spectators.

It had a stage and backdrop used for the presentation of plays, along with a larger space suitable for the combat of gladiators and of animals, and other large-scale festivities. It was probably built near the end of the 1st century AD. In the early 4th century its stone was used in the construction of the fortress on the Île de Ia Cité, at a time when the province was threatened by barbarian invasion.

Much of the remaining building stone was reused in the city wall of Paris constructed by Philippe-Auguste in the 12th century.

The site was discovered in 1867-68 during the construction of Rue Monge by Louis-Napoleon, and excavations were begun in 1870. A bus depot was planned to be built on the same site, but a coalition of notable Parisans, including Victor Hugo, insisted that the vestiges be saved. They were declared a monument, and partially rebuilt beginning in 1915-16.

=== The Theatre ===

The Roman theatre of Lutetia was located where the Lycée Saint-Louis is today, along Boulevard Saint-Michel. It occupied one of the central blocks of the Roman city, three hundred Roman feet on each side. It was probably built in the second part of the 1st century AD, based on coins found; it was renovated in the 2nd century. Like many other buildings on the left bank in the 4th century its stone was used in the building of the wall and new buildings on the Île-de-la-Cité. It was excavated and recreated by Theodore Vacquer between 1861 and 1884.

The slope of Mt. Genevieve was used to provide elevation for the semi-circular seating. The back of the stage faced onto to the Roman road and was decorated with arches and columns. The &quot;pulpitum&quot;, or front stage, and &quot;parascenum&quot;, or back stage, rested on a base of cement. When excavated in the 19th century, the chalk builders&#x27; marks were still visible on the floor. 

The theatre had two groups of seating; the &quot;maenianum&quot;, or general audience seating, higher up and farther back, and the &quot;maenianum&quot; of the podium, for the notables, in front of the orchestra stage. It had a separate entrance, and was accessed by a covered corridor. There were also several &quot;vomitoria&quot;, or underground passageways, to the seats of the spectators. The arena probably had some form of covering over the seats to protect spectators from rain.

=== The Baths ===
The Thermes de Cluny, the grand public baths, now part of the Musée de Cluny, are the largest and best-preserved vestige of Roman Lutetia and date from the late 1st or early 2nd century AD. They were at the junction of the two major Roman roads, between Boulevard Saint-Michel, Boulevard Saint-Germaine, and the Rue des Ecoles. The baths originally occupied a much larger area of about 300 x 400 Roman feet, a standard Roman city block, covering about one hectare.

Clients entered the baths near the modern Rue des Ecoles into a large courtyard lined with shops. They would cross the courtyard to the entrance of the baths, change their clothes, and go first into the caldarium, a hot and steamy room with benches and a pool of heated water. The room was heated by a hypocaust, an under-floor system of tunnels filled with hot air, heated by furnaces tended by slaves. After a period of time there, bathers would move to the frigidarium, which had a cold-water pool and baths, or to the tepidarium, which had the same features at room-temperature. They played an important social and political role in Lutetia as in other Roman cities. They were free of charge, or accessible for a small fee, and contained not only baths but also bars, places to rest, meeting rooms and libraries.

The original baths were probably destroyed during the first invasion by the Franks and Alamans in 275, then rebuilt. The frigidarium, with its vault intact, and the caldarium are the main remaining rooms. They were originally covered on the inside with mosaics, marble or frescoes. The northern side was occupied by two &quot;gymnasia&quot; and at the centre of the facade was a monumental fountain. Beneath there are several lower rooms with vaulted roofs. The drain for emptying the frigidarium pool is still visible that encircled the baths and ran into a main drain located under Boulevard Saint-Michel.

Remains of other baths have been discovered. The best-preserved were found in the 19th century within the present College de France on the &quot;Cardo&quot; or rue Saint-Jacques. They were of about two hectares, even larger than Cluny, and included a &quot;Palaestra&quot;, or large outdoor exercise area. Vestiges of the circular hot water pool and the cold water pool have survived, along with the hypocaust heating system. Traces were also found of marble wall coverings, frescoes and bronze fixtures.

Others were found in rue Gay-Lussac and on the Ile de la Cite.

=== Streets ===
The streets and squares were laid out in blocks (&quot;insulae&quot;) of 300 Roman feet (88.8 m) square. As a result the modern Rue Saint Martin and Rue Saint-Denis, which were both laid out in Roman times, are 600 Roman feet apart. 
Excavations of the streets have uncovered the ruts in the roads from the wheels of chariots and wagons. The roads were regularly repaired with fresh stones, gradually raising their height by as much as a metre.

=== Residences ===

The residential streets of Lutetia, unlike the boulevards, were irregular and not as-well maintained as they were the responsibility of the home-owners, not the city. Traces of several of these early residential neighbourhoods, dating to the beginning of the 1st century AD, particularly on the Rue de l&#x27;Abbé de l&#x27;Épée, rue Pierre-et-Marie-Curie, and the garden of the Êcole des Mines have been discovered.

The houses generally had wood frames covered with clay. The floors were covered with yellow clay or packed earth. Excavations showed that the city had an important plaster industry; plaster was used to simulate stone, as a covering, or in the form of bricks and tiles.

The houses of the wealthy often had an underfloor heating system and their own bath suite. Their interior walls were covered with plaster, and often painted with frescoes, some traces of which have been recovered (see gallery). They frequently had a reception room on the ground floor and bedrooms upstairs, accessed by a stairway, as well as a cellar which sometimes had its own well. Several houses were grouped together with a common courtyard. 

In May 2006, a Roman road was found during expansion of the University of Pierre and Marie Curie campus. Additionally, remains of private houses dating from the reign of Augustus (27 BC – 14 AD) containing heated floors were found. The owners were wealthy enough to own baths which was a status symbol among Roman citizens.

===Aqueduct===
The source of the aqueduct was in the hills outside the city at Rungis and Wissous in the present department of the Essonne where a collection tank was excavated. The aqueduct was built in the second half of the 1st century AD mainly to supply the monumental public baths of Cluny. The aqueduct could deliver an estimated 2000 m3 of water a day. The masonry and cement conduit, about 1/2 metre wide and 3/4 metre deep, was mainly below ground level over the distance of 26 kilometres to the city. The major obstacle it faced was crossing the valley of the river Bièvre where the conduit was raised on arches, some of which still exist in the Valley of Arcueil-Cachan.

Vestiges of the aqueduct have been discovered in several places including under the Institute Curie.
=== The Île de la Cité ===

Beginning in 307 AD, the increasing number of invasions of Gaul by Germanic tribes forced the Lutetians to abandon a large part of the city on the left bank, and to move to the Île de la Cité.

Vestiges of Roman buildings on the island, including baths, were found under the parvis of Notre-Dame in 1965 and can be seen today. The rampart was about two metres tall with a wooden walkway and, like most of the buildings on the island, was built from stone brought from the demolished buildings on the left bank.

A modest headquarters or &quot;Palace&quot; was constructed at the west end of the island, where the Palais de Justice is today. One was the residence and headquarters of the Roman military commander, and the temporary residence of two Emperors during the military campaigns. It was probably here that Julian was proclaimed emperor by his troops in 361.
Another important building on the island was the civic basilica, fulfilling the judicial functions transferred from the Left Bank. It stood between the modern Rue de la Cité and the Tribunal de Commerce, near where the flower market is today. It was discovered in 1906 during the construction of the Paris Metro station. It was 70 x 35 m with a central nave. The entrance was probably on the Rue de la Cité, the Cardo Maximus which crossed the island and connected the bridges.

=== Cemeteries ===

During the early, or High Roman Empire, the major Roman necropolis, or cemetery, was located near the Cardo Maximus (Main Street), close to the exit of the city and some distance from the nearest residences. The Necropolis of Saint-Jacques was close to the modern intersection of Avenue Saint-Michel and Avenue Denfert-Rochereau. It occupied a space of about four hectares, and was in use from the beginning of the first until about the fourth century AD. About four hundred tombs, a fraction of the tombs that were once there, have been excavated. Tombs were often placed one above the other. Some remains were buried in stone sepulchres, others in wooden coffins, others simply in the ground. It was a common practice to bury the dead with some items of their belongings, usually some of their clothing and particularly their shoes, placed in vases. Sometimes items of food and silverware were placed in the burial vessel. 

In the later years of the Empire, when the pressure of invading Germanic tribes led to the abandonment of the old monuments, a new necropolis, named for Saint-Marcel, was established near the modern Avenue des Gobelins and Boulevard du Port Royal, along the Roman main road leading to Italy. In this necropolis the tombs were mostly composed of stone taken from the monuments in the earlier necropolis of Saint-Jacques. One of the tombs there, dating from the Third Century AD, is notable for the first recorded use of the name &quot;Paris&quot; for the city. The tombs at Saint Marcel contain a variety of ceramic and glass objects from the workshops of the city, placed at the foot of the deceased. The first symbols of Christian burials, in the 5th century, were also found here.

=== Art and Decoration ===

Lutetia was both a trading centre for art works, through its access to water and land routes, and, later, the home of workshops ceramics and other decorative works. Sculpture was widely used in monuments, particularly in the several necropoli, or Roman cemeteries, in the outskirts of the city.

The Pillar of the Boatmen was donated to the city in about 14-17 AD (dedicated to the Emperor Tiberius) by the guild of boatmen, the most influential guild in the city, and was found in the Île-de-la-Cité. It depicted both Roman and Gallic deities in a series of blocks stacked into a column.

==Legacy==
Several scientific discoveries have been named after Lutetia. The element lutetium was named in honor of its discovery in a Paris laboratory, and the characteristic building material of the city of Paris, Lutetian Limestone, derives from the ancient name. The &quot;Lutetian&quot; is, in the geologic timescale, a stage or age in the Eocene Epoch. The asteroid 21 Lutetia, discovered in 1852 by Hermann Goldschmidt, is named after the city.

Archaically, it was not unheard of for French people, particularly poets and musicians, to use the name Lutèce as a poetic or literary replacement for Paris as we know it. A famous post-Revolutionary Era French chanson titled &quot;Te souviens-tu?&quot;, French for &quot;Do you remember?&quot;, refers to the city of Paris as such. This is comparable to many English writers poetically using the term Albion to refer to the Isle of Great Britain.

Lutetia is featured in the French comic series &quot;The Adventures of Asterix&quot;, most notably in &quot;Asterix and the Golden Sickle&quot;, &quot;Asterix and the Banquet&quot;, &quot;Asterix and the Laurel Wreath&quot; and &quot;Asterix and the White Iris&quot;.

Renault uses the name Lutecia for the Japanese market Clio subcompact car, and is named after Lutetia.

<text>Baron Monson (pronounced &quot;Munson&quot;), of Burton in the County of Lincoln, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 18th century for Sir John Monson, 5th Baronet. The Monson family descends from Thomas Monson, of Carleton, Lincolnshire. He sat as Member of Parliament for Lincolnshire, Castle Rising and Cricklade. On 29 June 1611 he was created a Baronet, of Carleton in the County of Lincoln, in the Baronetage of England. His eldest son, the second Baronet, fought as a Royalist during the Civil War and also represented Lincoln in the House of Commons.

He married Ursula Oxenbridge, daughter of Sir Robert Oxenbridge of Hurstbourne in Hampshire, through which marriage the manor of Broxbourne came into the Monson family. This was to be the seat of the family for many years. His eldest son, the third Baronet, also represented Lincoln in Parliament. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baronet. He sat as a Member of Parliament for Lincoln, Heytesbury, Hertford and for Aldborough.

His son, the fifth Baronet, represented Lincoln in Parliament. In 1728 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Monson, of Burton in the County of Lincoln. He later served as President of the Board of Trade. Lord Monson married Lady Margaret, youngest daughter of Lewis Watson, 1st Earl of Rockingham. Their second son the Hon. Lewis Monson succeeded to the Watson estates on the death of his cousin Thomas Watson, 3rd Earl of Rockingham, assumed the surname of Watson in lieu of Monson and was created Baron Sondes in 1760 (his great-grandson was created Earl Sondes in 1880; see this title for more information on this branch of the family). Lord Monson was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He declined the offer of an earldom in 1766.

His great-great-grandson, the seventh Baron, was a Liberal politician. In 1886, he was created Viscount Oxenbridge, of Burton in the County of Lincoln, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. However, this title became extinct on his death in 1889, while the barony and baronetcy passed to his brother, the eighth Baron. He held several court positions.
His great-grandson, the eleventh Baron, was a civil liberties campaigner and president of the Society for Individual Freedom who sat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher. He was one of the 90 elected hereditary peers who remained in the House after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. Since 2011, the titles are held by his son Nicolas. The heir presumptive is the present holder&#x27;s younger brother, Hon. Andrew Anthony John Monson (born 1959).

Several other members of the Monson family have gained distinction. Sir William Monson, younger brother of the first Baronet, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. Sir William Monson, second son of the first Baronet, was created Viscount Monson in the Peerage of Ireland in 1628. However, he was a member of the court which tried King Charles I and was deprived of his honours and sentenced to imprisonment for life in 1661. Also, Sir Edmund Monson, younger brother of the first Viscount Oxenbridge and the eighth Baron, was a noted diplomat and served as British Ambassador to France from 1896 to 1904. In 1905 he was created a Baronet in his own right (see Monson baronets for more information).

<text>Knautia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae. It includes 55 species native to Europe, North Africa, Western and Central Asia, and Siberia. The common names are variants of &quot;widow flower&quot;. Others are given the name &quot;scabious&quot;, which properly belongs to the related genus (&quot;Scabiosa&quot;). The name &quot;Knautia&quot; comes from the 17th-century German botanists, Drs. Christoph and Christian Knaut.

<text>Halych (, ; ; ; ; , &quot;Halitsch&quot; or &quot;Galitsch&quot;; ) is a historic city on the Dniester River in western Ukraine. The city gave its name to the Principality of Halych, the historic province of Galicia (Halychyna), and the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, of which it was the capital until the early 14th century, when the seat of the local rulers moved to Lviv.

Nowadays, Halych is a small town located only on one part of the territory of the former Galician capital, although it has preserved its name. It belongs to Ivano-Frankivsk Raion (district) of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (region). It hosts the administration of Halych urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Halych lies north of the oblast capital, Ivano-Frankivsk. Population: 

==Name==

The city&#x27;s name, though spelled identically in modern East Slavic languages (Галич), is pronounced &quot;Halych&quot; in Ukrainian and &quot;Galich&quot; in Russian. The Russian transliteration should not be confused with the Russian town of Galich. In Polish the name is rendered &quot;Halicz&quot;; in the Yiddish language &quot;Helitsh&quot; or &quot;Heylitsh&quot; (העליטש); in Latin, &quot;Galic&quot;; in Hungarian, &quot;Halics&quot;; in Romanian, &quot;Halici&quot;.

Local folk legend would have it that the name &quot;Halych&quot; comes from a legendary &quot;Prince Halychyna&quot;, the first ruler of these lands. In fact, a kurgan referred to by locals as &quot;Halychyna&#x27;s tomb&quot;, excavated in 1996, contained a ritual cremation site and a bronze weapon and gold disc that could have belonged to a noble leader. Max Vasmer and modern Slavists generally agree that &quot;Halych&quot; is an adjective derived from the East Slavic word for &quot;jackdaw&quot; (&quot;halka&quot;). This bird featured in the town&#x27;s old coat of arms.

==History==
The oldest archaeological artifacts from the territory of Halych are classified to Paleolithic period 40,000 years ago. More systematic findings from a wide number of archaeological cultures dated from 5500 BC, indicate continuous occupation of the region for the past 7,000 years, and suggest the population of Halych increased significantly in the 7th and 8th centuries BCE.

Local officials attribute the first written mention of Halych to the year 896. This date is supported by a record found in the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, court chronicles of the Hungarian king Béla III dating from the beginning of the 13th century. The chronicles describe a stay of Hungarian tribes led by Prince Álmos in Halych on their way through Slavic land to Pannonia. The claim is not supported by serious scholars. Similarly, another curious date for the first written mention, 290 AD (with a reference to &quot;Getica&quot; by Goth Jordanes) is not accepted by majority.

===Old Halych (Princely Halych)===

The most comprehensive records about Halych are found in the Hypatian Codex of the Primary Chronicle. The Old Halych is also being referred to as Princely Halych (, Knyazhyi Halych) in some Ukrainian sources in order to distinguish it from the contemporary city. Today Old Halych as a settlement of the Old Ruthenia (Rus) is an archaeological landmark on a territory of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. Located in confluence of Dniester and its tributaries, the Old Halych appeared on the basis of several early settlements and trading sites of White Croats, that in 12–13th centuries merged into a single conurbation. The central part of the human settlement with the Dormition Cathedral and princely chambers, fortified with powerful ramparts and moats, was located over Lukva River (Dniester&#x27;s tributary) at the place of contemporary village of Krylos.


The first dynasty of Halych, descending from Vladimir of Novgorod, a Rurik family branch known as Rostislavichi, culminated in Yaroslav Osmomysl (1153–1187) – after whose rule Béla III of Hungary briefly conquered the Principality in 1188—before going extinct in 1199. The same year Roman the Great founded the new Rurikid dynasty, uniting Halychyna and Volhynia into the more powerful principality of Halych-Volhynia. In 1141 Prince (knyaz) Volodymyrko Volodarovych (1104–1152) who united the competing principalities of Przemyśl, Zvenyhorod and Terebovlya into the state of Halychyna transferred his capital from Zvenyhorod to Halych making it the seat of his Rurikid dynasty and considerably expanding the settlement.

The Mongols under Batu Khan took the capital in 1241, when the famous King Danylo was its ruler. Thereafter the town steadily declined, eventually ceding supremacy to the newly founded Lviv.
The excavations of 1933–42 (Jaroslaw Pasternak), 1951–52 (Karger M.K., Aulikh V.), and 1955 uncovered remains of houses, workshops, fortifications, and ten churches built of white stone. Pasternak&#x27;s excavations established that ancient Halych originated on the spot of today&#x27;s village Krylos (located 5 km south of modern Halych) as early as the 10th century. In 1936 Pasternak also discovered remains of an 11th to 12th century three-apse cathedral with burial tomb of Prince Yaroslav Osmomysl in it. The cathedral is ascribed to the Cathedral of the Dormition previously known only from Chronicles, known to have been a sepulchre of the earliest Halychian princes. The sheer size (37,5 by 32,4 m) of the cathedral (the second largest mediaeval church on the territory of present-day Ukraine, smaller only to St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv), suggests that ancient Halych was the seat of a diocese. Most likely the cathedral was built in 1157 and destroyed in 1241 by hordes of Batu Khan, then rebuilt again and last time mentioned in 1576.

It is believed that the early Halychian architectural style, thoroughly permeated with Romanesque influences from the West, had been transferred further north-east. The builders of temples in Halych are believed to have also been responsible for the extant Pereslavl Cathedral and Church of Intercession upon Nerl. The foundations of the Assumption Cathedral (1157) are still to be seen. The only surviving medieval church is that of Saint Pantaleon, originally constructed at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, but significantly rebuilt in the 17th century and controversially reconstructed in the 1990s. The archaeological excavations (1989–2005 under direction of Yuri Lukomsky) at the terrains of Krylos and Halych continue.

===Halych===

Gradually, old Halych depopulated to the point that its only mid-14th-century inhabitants were the Metropolitan of Halych and his staff. The present-day town is situated about 5 kilometres (3 miles) away from the ancient capital of Halychyna, on the spot where the old town&#x27;s riverport used to be located and where prince Lubart of Lithuania constructed his wooden castle in 1367.

Its main historical monument is the church dedicated to the Nativity of Mary. Originally built at the turn of the 14th and 15th century, it was restored in 1825. Also of interest is an equestrian monument to Danylo of Halych, opened in 2003 to mark the 750th anniversary of that prince&#x27;s coronation as the king of Ruthenia.

In 1349, following the death of Duke Bolesław Jerzy II of Mazovia and the Galicia–Volhynia Wars, Halych was annexed by Polish King Casimir III the Great. In 1367, it was granted Magdeburg rights, and in the same year, a Roman Catholic Diocese was established here. Five years later, Pope Gregory XI created in Avignon the Archdiocese of Halicz, which controlled the Dioceses of Kholm (Chełm), Peremyshl (Przemyśl) and Volodymyr-Volynskyi (Włodzimierz Wołyński). In 1409, the Archdiocese was moved to Lviv.

After King Casimir&#x27;s death (1370), Louis I, King of Poland and Hungary subjected Red Ruthenia to the authority of Hungarian-appointed starostas, overlooked by Duke Vladislaus II of Opole, Palatine of Hungary. Hungarians remained in Halich until 1387, when Queen Jadwiga of Poland removed them and re-annexed the area into Poland. In the Kingdom of Poland, Halich remained one of main administrative centers of the Ruthenian Voivodeship. In 1564, the Sejm in Warsaw created a sejmik in Halicz, which ruled over the Ziemia of Halicz, including the powiats of Halicz, Trembowla and Kolomyja.

During the Polish–Ottoman War (1620–21), Halicz was burned by Crimean Tatars (1621), and in 1624, Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski defeated the Tatars at Martynów, near Halicz. In 1649, Halicz was once again destroyed by Cossacks of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, further destruction took place in 1676, during the Polish–Ottoman War (1672–76). In 1765, Halicz had 110 houses and 3 churches, and Franciszek Ksawery Potocki serving as local starosta. The town was seized by Austrian troops in 1772, and remained part of the Habsburg Empire until late 1918.

In 1870, the population of Halicz was 4142, including 1609 Roman Catholics, 1690 Greek-Catholics, and 839 Jews. On November 1, 1918, until May 1919, the town was administered by Ukrainians. Following the Polish–Ukrainian War, Halicz temporarily returned to Poland, which was confirmed in Paris on June 25, 1919. On September 16, 1920, during the Polish–Soviet War, the Battle of Dytiatyn took place near Halicz, and on March 15, 1923, the Conference of Ambassadors recognized permanent Polish control over eastern part of former Galicia. Until the Soviet invasion of Poland, Halicz belonged to Stanisławów Voivodeship, in which it was the seat of a county.

In the beginning of July 1941, the town was occupied by Germans. The Jewish community was large. Most of the Jews lived in the town center on the right bank of the Dniester River.
In the fall of 1941 or 1942, 1,000 Jews were murdered in a mass execution. Some 20–30 Jews were drowned in the river.

After World War II, its Polish residents were resettled to the so-called Recovered Territories.

On 8 February 1994, Ancient Halych preserve has been created to preserve and promote the architectural sites in Halych of 11th–17th centuries.

Until 18 July 2020, Halych was the administrative center of Halych Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast to six. The area of Halych Raion was merged into Ivano-Frankivsk Raion.

<text>Baron Boston, of Boston in the County of Lincoln, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1761 for the court official and former Member of Parliament, Sir William Irby, 2nd Baronet. He had earlier represented Launceston and Bodmin in the House of Commons. He was the son of Edward Irby, Member of Parliament for Boston, who was created a baronet, of Whaplode and Boston in the County of Lincoln, in the Baronetage of England on 13 April 1704. Lord Boston&#x27;s son, the second Baron, was a Lord of the Bedchamber to both George III and George IV. The title followed the line of his eldest son, the third Baron, until the death of the latter&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the eighth Baron, in 1972. The late Baron was succeeded by his third cousin once removed, the ninth Baron. He was the great-grandson of Rear-Admiral Frederick Paul Irby, second son of the second Baron. Since 2007, the title is held by his grandson, the 11th Baron.

The family seat was Hedsor House, Hedsor, Buckinghamshire. The family also owned Plas Llanidan and land at Lligwy in Moelfre, Anglesey, Wales.

<text>Craig Wireless Systems, Ltd. (initially Western Manitoba Broadcasters Ltd., then Craig Broadcast Systems, Inc., &amp; next Craig Media, Inc. before its current branding) is a Canadian company which offers Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service in Manitoba and British Columbia.

In 2004, the company&#x27;s media assets (its TV stations &amp; A-Channel TV network) were acquired by CHUM Limited.

==History==

The company has its roots in Western Manitoba Broadcasters, a company John Craig founded alongside Dr. H.O. McDiarmid, Alexander Boyd, Edmund, Fotheringham, Harold Smith, James Rust and M.W. Kerr in 1948.

In the mid-1940s, Craig had bought radio station CKX-FM from the Manitoba Government Telephone System upon its relinquishment of its two licenses for CKX-TV &amp; CKY-FM.

By 1955, John&#x27;s son, Stuart Craig, had succeeded his father as President and General Manager of CKX-TV (which brought television to Brandon, Manitoba) &amp; CKX-FM (which followed in 1963). Craig took it upon himself to expand the operations of both CKX stations; those expansion operations resulted in the launch of the broadcast company.

The company was based in Brandon, Manitoba, then later in Calgary, Alberta with Drew Craig, John&#x27;s grandson &amp; Stuart&#x27;s son, as its CEO.

In 1991, Western Manitoba Broadcasters changed its name to Craig Broadcast Systems.

Craig Broadcast Systems was the owner of the original A-Channel system; CKX, a CBC affiliate, in Brandon, Manitoba; and three digital television specialty channels: MTV Canada (now MTV2), MTV2 (now Stingray Juicebox), and TV Land Canada (later replaced by Comedy Gold, now decommissioned).

For a time in the 1980s and 1990s, the company also produced a local newscast in Dauphin, Manitoba; however, the company did not operate a full television station in that city, but had a contract with CBC Television to run the newscast as a local insertion on the city&#x27;s CBWT retransmitter.

Eventually, the company was also operating in the telecommunications industry, offering wireless cable television and high-speed Internet services. The company also operated an American subsidiary in Honolulu, which in early 2003 slashed its staff ahead of merger talks with Oceanic Cable.

In 2003, after securing financing in the area of $145 million ($110 million from Providence Equity Partners &amp; a $35 million line of credit from RBC Capital Markets and BMO Nesbitt Burns), the company reorganized its conventional and specialty television operations, with the conventional TV operations (A-Channel &amp; its stations) under the Craig Media branding, while the specialty television channels were placed within Craig Media under Craig Specialty.

Craig Media was the owner of Toronto 1, a local television station in located in Toronto.

In 2004, the company&#x27;s TV broadcasting operations (A-Channel &amp; its stations) were acquired by CHUM Limited for CA$265 million ($197.8 million) in cash. CHUM did not acquire the company&#x27;s telecommunications operations, which remain in operation under the Craig Wireless name, which the company took on after CHUM&#x27;s acquisition of its television broadcasting assets. Upon the name change, another of John&#x27;s grandsons, Boyd, took over the company.

<text>Baron Vernon, of Kinderton in the County of Chester, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1762 for the former Member of Parliament George Venables-Vernon. He had previously represented Lichfield and Derby in the House of Commons. Born George Vernon, he was the son of Henry Vernon (see Vernon family), of Sudbury in Derbyshire, and Anne Pigott, daughter and heiress of Thomas Pigott by his wife Mary Venables, sister and heiress of Sir Peter Venables, Baron of Kinderton in Cheshire. In 1728, he assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Venables upon inheriting the Venables estate in Cheshire from his childless cousin Anne, widow of the 2nd Earl of Abingdon.

Lord Vernon was married three times. He married, thirdly, Martha Harcourt, granddaughter of Simon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt.

As a prominent son and forefather of the present title-holder, their second son was Edward Harcourt, Archbishop of York who succeeded to the Harcourt family estates on the death of his cousin the William Harcourt, 3rd Earl Harcourt and so assumed by Royal Licence the surname of Harcourt, with his children known as Vernon-Harcourt. Edward was George&#x27;s third son.

Lord Vernon was succeeded by his son from his first marriage to the Hon. Mary Howard and the second Lord Vernon, as Hon. George Venables-Vernon before his accession sat as a Member of Parliament for Weobly, Bramber and Glamorganshire in turn and was appointed as a senior Liberal whip in the House of Lords.

His half-brother succeeded, the third Baron, the eldest son of Martha Harcourt. His son, the fourth Baron, married Frances Maria Warren, daughter of Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, 1st Baronet. His son, the fifth Baron, represented Derbyshire and Derbyshire South in the House of Commons. He assumed in 1837 by sign manual the surname of Warren only for himself and subsequent issue, but this appears to have been repudiated by his son.

His grandson, the seventh Baron, served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard (Deputy Chief Whip in the House of Lords) in the last Liberal administration of William Ewart Gladstone. On the death in 2000 of his grandson, the tenth Baron, this line of the family failed. The late Baron was succeeded by his distant relative (his fifth cousin once removed), the eleventh and present holder of the title. He is the great-great-grandson of Admiral Frederick Edward Vernon-Harcourt, fourth son of Edward Harcourt, Archbishop of York.

The ancestral family seat of the Barons Vernon is Sudbury Hall, near Uttoxeter, Derbyshire, which was given to the National Trust in 1967 in lieu of death duties after the death of the 9th Baron Vernon. The family of the late 10th Baron still keeps a residence in the grounds of the Sudbury Hall estate.

None of the Lords Vernon are among the excepted hereditary peers and none have achieved any votes in by-elections.

For other branches of the family, see Vernon family.

<text>The slaad (pluralized as slaadi, or as slaads in the 4th edition) is a fictional monster in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game. They are extraplanar creatures (outsiders) that resemble giant humanoid toads of various colors (red, blue, grey, white, black), and other types, such as mud, and death slaadi.

==Publication history==

===Development and licensing===
The slaadi were created by Charles Stross and published in the TSR UK book, &quot;Fiend Folio Tome of Creatures Malevolent and Benign&quot; (1981). Stross said of their creation:

For much of their existence, the slaadi were the subject of jokes by D&amp;D players due to their distinctly frog-like appearance, which was emphasized in early artistic depictions of the monsters. With the advent of the Planescape campaign setting, TSR, Inc. made an effort to create a more fearsome image of the slaadi, with their toad qualities toned down in favor of showing more frightening aspects depicting them as beings of pure chaos. This Planescape envisioning of the slaadi carried forth into the 3rd Edition of the D&amp;D game and has persisted ever since.

Because they were created by a D&amp;D player (and their copyrights transferred to TSR and, subsequently, Wizards of the Coast), slaadi are one of only a handful of D&amp;D monsters considered &quot;Product Identity&quot; by Wizards of the Coast and, as such, are not released under its Open Gaming License.

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 1st edition (1977–1988)===
The blue slaad, death slaad (the lesser masters), the green slaad, the grey slaad (the executioners), and the red slaad appear in the first edition &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; (1981), along with Ssendam, Lord of the Insane, and Ygorl, Lord of Entropy. Ed Greenwood, in his review of the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, considered the slaad &quot;worthy additions to any campaign&quot;.

The slaadi and their role in the planes are detailed in this edition&#x27;s &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (1987).

Another slaad lord, Wartle, appeared in the adventure anthology, &quot;Tales of the Outer Planes&quot; (1988).

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition (1989–1999)===
The blue slaad, death slaad, the gray slaad, the green slaad, and the red slaad appear first in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Outer Planes Appendix&quot; (1991), and are reprinted in the Monstrous Manual (1993). The same set of slaadi appear for the Planescape campaign setting in the first &quot;Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix&quot; (1994).

Ygorl and Ssendam appear in &quot;Dragon&quot; #221 (September 1995) in the &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Bestiary&quot; column; the same article also introduced two new slaad lords: Chourst, Lord of Randomness, and Rennbuu, Lord of Colors.

The baby red slaad and the young red slaad appear in &quot;Dungeon&quot; #77 (November 1999).

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.0 edition (2000–2002)===
The blue slaad, death slaad, the gray slaad, the green slaad, and the red slaad appear in the Monster Manual for this edition (2000).

The slaadi and their role in the planes are detailed in this edition&#x27;s &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (2001). The black slaad and the white slaad appeared in the &quot;Epic Level Handbook&quot; (2002).

The appeared in &quot;Dragon&quot; #306 (April 2003).

The mud slaad appears in the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; (2003) for this edition.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.5 edition (2003–2007)===
The blue slaad, death slaad, the gray slaad, the green slaad, and the red slaad appear in the revised &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2003).

Another new slaad lord, Bazim-Gorag the Firebringer, first appeared in &quot;Dungeon&quot; #101 (August 2003). Bazim-Gorag later appeared in the Forgotten Realms book, &quot;Champions of Ruin&quot; (2005).

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition (2008–2014)===
The slaadi, pluralised as slaads, appear in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2008). In 4th edition, the slaads are elemental creatures, native to the Elemental Chaos.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition (2014–present)===
The slaadi appear in this edition of the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, with additional lore about the reproduction of slaadi. It also includes information concerning &quot;The Spawning Stone&quot; that was created by Primus, which ultimately led to the creation of the slaadi.

==Cultural impact==
Charles Stross, creator of the slaadi, used the creatures in his 2007 novel &quot;Halting State&quot;, where they appeared as an enemy in the fictional MMORPG &quot;Avalon Four&quot;.

The word &quot;slaad&quot; has been used to describe frog-like monsters in the comic Yamara and the webcomic &quot;Shadowgirls&quot;, which uses the word &quot;slaad&quot; to describe a race of monsters.

In Rich Burlew&#x27;s &quot;Order of the Stick&quot;, a chaotic evil character expresses surprise at two shoulder devils appearing instead of one devil and one angel; as he has no good or lawful sides whatsoever, the devils explain that the character has only them and the slaad.

Slaadi have appeared in 3rd-party game sourcebooks such as the &quot;Tome of Horrors&quot; from Necromancer Games. It was parodied in the HackMaster &quot;Hacklopedia of Beasts&quot;, published by Kenzer &amp; Company. The plot of the &quot;Downer&quot; series of graphic novels by Kyle Stanley Hunter, published by Paizo Publishing, revolves around a slaad-created artifact.

==Depiction==
In the D&amp;D game slaadi are native to the Outer Plane of Limbo. As such they are of the outsider type, being composed of the essence of their home plane. Encountered on most other planes they also receive the extraplanar subtype. Slaadi are almost always chaotic neutral except for the death slaadi, which are usually chaotic evil, and the gormeel slaadi, which are usually lawful neutral.

In the various D&amp;D products in which they are presented, slaadi are described as frog or toad-like humanoids. Within that rough characterization they have a wide range of forms depending on subtype, and often corresponding to their rank in society. Size also varies between the different subtypes, from human sized to several feet taller than human sized.

&quot;GameSpy&quot; author Allan Rausch described the slaadi as &quot;remorseless reptilian killing machines&quot;. They might have become &quot;popular creatures among players&quot;, but &quot;For many years, slaad were a joke -- because of their artwork&quot;, which showed them as &quot;six-foot tall carnivorous frogs&quot;. With the &quot;Planescape&quot; setting they &quot;were reinterpreted artistically to be less frog-like and much more fearsome&quot;, a development continued into the 3rd edition of the game.

===Society===
In various editions of D&amp;D the slaadi have been depicted as having a complex social system bound up in the relationship and reproductive cycles of the various subtypes. Some subtypes dominate others, though as slaadi are creatures of chaos, such domination occurs not through a regimented hierarchy, but by brute force. In earlier D&amp;D editions a symbol of power was embedded in each slaad&#x27;s forehead, and non-magical tattoos on the forehead represented achievements and status. The latter physical characteristics do not appear in 3rd and later editions of D&amp;D. In earlier editions of D&amp;D the slaad were divided only into red, blue, green, gray and death subtypes. 3rd Edition D&amp;D added the mud, and epic level white and black subtypes. In all editions the slaad have been dominated by the Slaad Lords, Ssendam and Ygorl.

Red and blue slaadi reproduce by infecting living hosts. The red do so by implanting eggs beneath their victim&#x27;s skin which grow into a baby blue slaad that eats the host from within. The blue infect the host with a lycanthropy-like disease that slowly transforms them into a red slaad. Despite being the means of producing the other slaad type, reds and blues despise one another. If either a red slaad or blue slaad infects an arcane spellcaster, the host will spawn a green slaad, superior to its parent in that it may cast spells. A green slaad, upon reaching its hundredth year of life, will retreat into isolation for the duration of about a year. Upon its return it has transformed into a smaller, but more powerful grey slaad, which focus more on spell-casting than most other slaadi. Some grey slaadi undergo an unnamed, mysterious ritual, which transforms them into death slaadi. Death slaadi possess amazing magical and physical might, but eschew focusing on the former, as the greys do, being bent more on perpetuating slaughter and death. As such, death slaad tend more towards an evil alignment than do most other slaadi. If the death slaad survives a century, it turns into the white slaad. If the white slaad survives a century, it turns into a black slaad in the manner of its preceding transformations. The black slaad is the most powerful slaad, excluding the slaad lords. The reproductive cycle of mud slaadi is not detailed.

The Spawning Stone is the primordial home of the slaadi, located in &quot;a realm of their greatest dominion&quot;, and drifting about Limbo. The passage of the stone generates currents in the raw chaos-stuff of the plane, and slaadi are able to follow these currents &quot;upstream&quot; to the Stone&#x27;s location. In the mating season, each race of slaad converges on the Spawning Stone, wresting the Stone away from the previous group, so that they may fertilize each other&#x27;s internal egg sacs, and carry away the seed-like fertilized eggs for later implantation into host bodies. Sometimes, however, young slaadi are produced right there at the stone because the slaadi implant each other in their mating frenzy. Thus, dead adult slaadi routinely float about the stone until destroyed by the chaos of Limbo. True slaadi are described as beings of ultimate chaos who have no set form. Only the Slaad Lords Ssendam and Ygorl are representative of this type. Somehow they affected the &#x27;Spawning Stone&#x27; to prevent the emergence of slaadi more powerful than them, which keeps the slaadi within the aforementioned groups. Although anomalies do slip through in the chaos, they have less variety, and less chance of being more powerful than the Slaad Lords. One such anomaly is the Gormeel Slaad, which is a subtype introduced in an article in &quot;Dragon&quot; as a large, mutant variety &quot;born from the Spawning Stone&quot;, and escaping the notice of Ygorl and Ssendam. They are lawful in alignment, serving as allies and sometimes mounts of the githzerai against other slaadi.

In 5e, the Spawning Stone was revealed to be created by the modron leader Primus in an attempt to tame Limbo, but the plane corrupted its original purpose and produced the slaadi as an immune response. Their reproductive process is an expression of how Limbo turned the Stone, an artifact of pure Law, into a tool of Chaos.

==Slaad Lords==
Slaad Lords are the de facto rulers of the Slaadi race. True to their chaotic nature, they often do not appear anything like other Slaadi.
Known slaad lords include Ygorl, Lord of Entropy; Ssendam, Lord of Madness; Chourst, Lord of Randomness; Rennbuu, Lord of Colors; and Wartle.

*Chourst the Unpredictable is the slaad Lord of Randomness. Chourst appeared in second edition in &quot;Dragon&quot; #221 (September 1995). Chourst has no residence, home base, or even any temporary domicile; he feels at home wherever he goes. Chourst has no particular dogma; he only wishes to indulge himself whenever and wherever possible. One moment he may be tearing a githzerai to pieces, and the next he may stop suddenly to sniff a pretty flower that caught his fancy.
*Ssendam is the Slaad Lord of Insanity. Ssendam was created by Charles Stross, and first appeared in the first edition &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; (1981). Ssendam appears as a gigantic golden amoeba with a humanoid brain as a nucleus. Ssendam has been described alternatively as male and female in different sources. 
*Ygorl is the Slaad Lord of Entropy. He was created by Charles Stross, and first appeared in the first edition &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; (1981). Ygorl is the second oldest slaad lord, after Ssendam, and is considered the de facto ruler of Outer Plane of Limbo. He is said to have created the Spawning Stone that is the focus of the slaad race, forcing them to take froglike forms rather than their original, purely chaotic shapes.

==Famous Slaadi==

===Forgotten Realms, The Erevis Cale trilogy===
In Paul S. Kemp&#x27;s Erevis Cale trilogy, the main antagonist known as the Sojourner has four slaadi henchmen that he refers to as his &quot;children&quot; named Azriim, Dolgan, Eleura and Serrin. In the books they appear to be bound to the Sojourner, and serve as a constant foe to Erevis Cale and his companions as they try to thwart the Sojourner. They are all green slaadi and have been granted various powers by the Sojourner. They can cast magic, shapeshift, heal at a very fast rate, and have telepathy. They all tend to choose a human form that suits their taste and only transform back into their slaad forms at certain occasions, mostly when they feed or fight. Azriim (the leader) chooses a half-drow form with 2 different color eyes, Dolgan chooses a Cormyrean warrior and is the dumb brute of the gang, Serrin is dark and assassin-like and chooses a slender human. Their true slaad forms are green, very large, scaled reptiles, with powerful legs, long claws, and sharp teeth. During the series the Sojourner, with the power to destroy worlds at a whim, transforms Dolgan and Azriim into gray slaadi as a reward. They are portrayed as a mix between a moth and reptile, and have the ability to fly. They are later transformed into death slaadi, which are portrayed as their original reptilian slaad form, with slightly altered physical features. Their most notable trait is that they appear almost see-through and have much stronger abilities. At the end of the trilogy Azriim alone survived and went to his way.

===Xanxost===
Xanxost is a blue slaad with a penchant for exploring the planes, explaining their secrets to everyone interested, and eating whatever he can catch, particularly mephits. He appears as a character in the Planescape accessories &quot;Faces of Evil: The Fiends&quot; and &quot;The Inner Planes&quot;. Both of these books are written in an in-universe style, as if they were created by someone within the Planescape setting, and within that writing style, both books have an &#x27;editor&#x27; who collected the investigations and opinions of various planar creatures on the topic at hand. Xanxost is one such character. &quot;Though his mannerisms are often odd, his information is always reliable&quot;.

In &quot;Faces of Evil&quot; he is one of the &#x27;authors&#x27; of the section on tanar&#x27;ri, and in &quot;The Inner Planes&quot; he &#x27;wrote&#x27; the section on the Quasielemental Plane of Steam. (The editor of the latter book claims that he was recruited to pen the chapter because feedback to his commentary in the former book was overwhelmingly positive.) Xanxost seems less chaotic than other slaadi in that he can write a mostly coherent piece of text, though his nature still shows through in his writing style, with many wanderings off-topic (mostly to the subject of food), repetitions of earlier remarks, and a seeming inability to count. He also refers to himself in third person. He also admits that his conflicts with tanar&#x27;ri have edged him slightly from pure Chaos towards the side of Good, at least for the time being. Xanxost is referred to as &quot;it&quot; in &quot;Faces of Evil&quot;, which makes some sense given the unusual nature of slaadi reproduction, but as &quot;he&quot; in &quot;The Inner Planes&quot;.

===Zgotar===
Zgotar, a death slaad, appears in Scott Bennie&#x27;s &quot;Threshold of Evil&quot; adventure in &quot;Dungeon Magazine&quot; #10. The primary villain of that adventure, Azurax Silverhawk, has been officially placed in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. However, Zgotar also appeared in &quot;Castle Greyhawk&quot; (1987) in an adventure scenario also written by Scott Bennie. In addition, Azurax is called a &quot;plane-wandering archmage&quot; and &quot;Old Empires&quot; said he has only recently purchased his property in the Hills of Maerth.

==Reception==
Ed Greenwood considered the slaadi &quot;worthy additions to any campaign&quot;.

&quot;GameSpy&quot; author Allan Rausch described the slaadi as &quot;remorseless reptilian killing machines&quot;, but &quot;For many years, slaad were a joke -- because of their artwork&quot;, which showed them as &quot;six-foot tall carnivorous frogs&quot;. With the &quot;Planescape&quot; setting they &quot;were reinterpreted artistically to be less frog-like and much more fearsome&quot;.

Shannon Applecline considered the slaad one of the game&#x27;s especially notable monsters.

==In other media==
* The slaad lord Ygorl appeared as the final boss in the video game &quot;Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone&quot;, where he was voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan. In the game, Ygorl was depicted as humanoid in appearance but was covered in tough chitinous armor and had many claw-like mandibles extending from the back of his head.
* Slaadi appear as enemies in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-based MMORPG &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online&quot;, and also in &quot;Neverwinter&quot;.

<text>Loral Corporation was a defense contractor founded in 1948 in New York by William Lorenz and Leon Alpert as Loral Electronics Corporation. The company&#x27;s name was taken from the first syllables of each founder&#x27;s surname.

==History==
Loral Corporation originally developed radar and sonar systems for the US Navy. In 1959 it went public with an initial offering of 250,000 shares at $12 each. Part of the proceeds from this offering were used to build a new headquarters on its site at 825 Bronx River Avenue, in the Soundview section of The Bronx, New York.

In 1959 it began to diversify, buying several smaller companies, through which it won more military contracts. Some purchased companies included Willor Manufacturing Corp., American Beryllium Co., Inc., of Sarasota, Florida, Arco Electronics, and several plastics companies.

In 1961, it formed a division for developing communications, telemetry, and space navigation systems for satellites.

As its expansion increased, it borrowed $15 million from the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1965.

In the late 1960s, it was awarded many military contracts, including a $3.9 million U.S. Navy contract for Doppler navigation radar in 1965, a $14 million contract from General Dynamics for advanced electronics for the U.S. Air Force F-111 airplane in 1969, and a $3.9 million contract for airborne countermeasures for the Phantom RF-4C reconnaissance plane. By the late 1960s, Loral specialized in radar receivers, which identified signatures of enemy radar systems on missiles and anti-aircraft guns.

By the late 1960s, Loral&#x27;s corporate purchases were causing problems for the company. By 1971 it had lost $3 million and was sometimes unable to meet its loan payments. Many acquisitions were not profitable and also not in Loral&#x27;s primary business. The founders, Lorenz and Alpert, were prepared to sell half their interest in the company.

Loral was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1972 before it was acquired by Bernard L. Schwartz. Over the next two decades he built it into a major player in the global aerospace and defense industry, acquiring 16 other defense and aerospace companies. In 1995, Loral had $5.5 billion in revenue. In 1996 Loral sold its defense electronics and system integration businesses to Lockheed Martin; its remaining units became Loral Space &amp; Communications. The following year, several of those former Loral units were spun off by Lockheed Martin to become the core of L-3 Communications.

Loral was accused of transferring technology to China in 1996. The incident arose as a result of an investigation into the launch failure of Intelsat 708, a Space Systems/Loral-built satellite. In a 2002 agreement with the State Department and Department of Justice the company agreed to pay $20 million in fines to settle the matter and to improve its compliance procedures. In the agreement Loral officials neither admitted nor denied the government&#x27;s charges; Loral executives acknowledged &quot;the nature and seriousness of the offenses alleged by the department in the draft charging letter, including the risk of harm to the security and foreign policy interests of the United States&quot;, and stated that they wished to make amends through the payment of restitution. Schwartz subsequently released a statement accepting &quot;full responsibility for the matter&quot; and portrayed the incident as an error by a single Loral employee.
