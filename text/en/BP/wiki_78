<text>Freising () is a university town in Bavaria, Germany, and the capital of the Freising &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district), with a population of about 50,000.

== Location ==

Freising is the oldest town between Regensburg and Bolzano, and is located on the Isar river in Upper Bavaria, north of Munich and near the Munich International Airport. The city is built on and around two prominent hills: the Cathedral Hill with the former Bishop&#x27;s Residence and Freising Cathedral, and Weihenstephan Hill with the former Weihenstephan Abbey, containing the oldest working brewery in the world. It was also the location of the first recorded tornado in Europe. The city is 448 meters above sea level. 

==Cultural significance==
Freising is one of the oldest settlements in Bavaria, becoming a major religious centre in the early Middle Ages. It is the centre of an important diocese. 
Some important historical documents were created between 900 and 1200 in its monastery:
* Freising manuscripts written in Slovenian, being the first Roman-script continuous text in a Slavic language
* Chronicle or history of the two cities by Otto of Freising

The above and other scripts from that time can be found in the &quot;Bayerische Staatsbibliothek&quot; (Bavarian State Library) in Munich.

==History==
Even though archaeological finds show that the area was settled in the late Stone Age and Bronze Age, no proof has been found yet to suggest a continuous settlement until the 8th century AD. 

Around 700 AD the Frankish Agilolfing dukes built a simple palace on the highest hill in Freising as part of its Duchy of Bavaria. 

In 724 AD, the Frankish Saint Corbinian was sent to the Duchy of Bavaria by the Catholic Church to spread Christianity. On the highest hill in Freising, where there was already a simple sanctuary, Corbinian erected a Benedictine monastery and a school, to help preach the Gospel to the local people. 

According to his &quot;Vita&quot; by Bishop Arbeo, Corbinian was on his way to Rome when his packhorse was attacked and killed by a wild bear. By divine power, Corbinian ordered the bear to carry his luggage over the Alps. When he finally arrived in Rome he let the bear free. The saddled bear is still the symbol of the city, displayed in the coat of arms, as well as statues and paintings. After Corbinian&#x27;s death, Saint Boniface established Freising as a Catholic diocese. Between 764–783, Bishop Arbeo founded a library and a &quot;scriptorium&quot; (writing room) at the abbey. The settlement started to become a religious centre.

The earliest recorded tornado in Europe struck Freising in 788.

The mortal remains of Pope Alexander I are said to have been transferred to Freising in 834. In 996, Freising received city rights from Emperor Otto III.

As early as the 10th century, in order to collect additional revenue, monks were sent from Freising down the Isar River to build a toll bridge on the Salt Road between Salzburg and Augsburg. This village would be later known as München (or Munich, which means &#x27;of the monks&#x27;). By 1158, Duke Henry the Lion destroyed the bridge and customs building and built new ones closer to his home further downriver, (near the center of modern downtown Munich), so that he could collect the revenue instead.

The construction of the Freising Cathedral in its current romanesque style started in 1159 and was completed in 1205. The Romanesque wooden ceiling was replaced by a gothic vault in 1481–1483.

Freising went through difficult times during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1632, the Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus came through Freising on his way to Munich. He demanded 30,000 guilders as the sum to protect the city from destruction. Nevertheless, his army sacked the city. Hunger and plague raged when the Swedes invaded the city again in 1646. In 1674, the Church placed a statue of the Virgin Mary in the city square as a sign that war and plague had been overcome.

A wave of witch hunts and trials broke out from 1715–1717 in Freising, and again in 1721–1723. Most of the accused were child beggars. Several children were executed.

In 1802/1803 Bavaria fell under the influence of Napoleonic France in which church controlled lands were secularized. In Freising, the more than thousand-year-old bishopric was abolished. The Roman Catholic Church lost most of its properties and authority over the city.
Though the seat of the diocese was moved to Munich in 1821, including the elevation to an archdiocese, Freising has remained the seat of diocesan administration until today.

In 1858 the Bavarian Eastern Railway Company built the first railway line from Munich to Freising, Landshut and Regensburg for passenger and rail traffic.

Near the end of the Second World War, Allied aircraft bombed Freising on April 18, 1945. By April 30, units of the US Army arrived in Freising.

In 1998, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, also known as Abu Hajir al-Iraqi, a key figure in the founding of al-Qaeda and a trusted associate of Osama Bin Laden, was apprehended in Freising.

In 2006, Pope Benedict XVI visited Freising during a papal visit. He was formerly archbishop of Munich/Freising from 1977 to 1982.

== Education and research ==

=== Schools ===
There are several elementary schools in the city of Freising. The St. Korbinian elementary school is located in the city center, the Neustift elementary school in Neustift, the St. Lantbert elementary school in Lerchenfeld and the Paul-Gerhardt elementary school in the north of the city. Another elementary school is the Vötting Elementary School, to which the schoolhouse in Pulling also belongs.

Secondary schools include the three secondary schools Neustift, Paul-Gerhard and Lerchenfeld. The first two are located at the sites of the elementary schools of the same names. The Karl-Meichelbeck-Realschule is located in the immediate vicinity of the Paul-Gerhard-Schule. At Guten Änger in Lerchenfeld, the new Montessori school building was opened in 2015 and a second Realschule in 2018. The Wippenhauser Straße is home to the Wirtschaftsschule and the Fachoberschule/Berufsoberschule. The oldest of Freising&#x27;s three high schools is the Dom-Gymnasium on the Domberg. The Camerloher-Gymnasium is one of the few artistic grammar schools. The Josef-Hofmiller-Gymnasium, which emerged from the Dom-Gymnasium, is Freising&#x27;s largest grammar school.

The Freising Vocational School and the Vocational School for Child Care are located in the same building. The latter is a full-time school that trains pediatric nurses in two years. The vocational school for nursing is affiliated with the Freising Clinic. The Weihenstephan State Vocational School for Floral Art offers advanced training to become a state-certified designer for floral art.

=== Universities ===
The Freising-Weihenstephan campus is an extensive complex of higher education institutions and research institutes in the western urban area of Freising, in the Weihenstephan and Vötting districts. It has been developed into the so-called &quot;Green Center of Bavaria&quot; for decades and continues to be modernized and designed as a &quot;science and research campus&quot;. It includes not only the &quot;Center of Life Sciences&quot;, the Weihenstephan Science Center for Nutrition, Land Use and Environment of the Technical University of Munich, but also the most important part of the Weihenstephan-Triesdorf University of Applied Sciences.

The Freising Clinic is an academic teaching hospital of the Technical University of Munich. It is located north of the old town.

=== Research and education centers ===
Several research centers have been established in the vicinity of the two universities, i.e. mostly located on campus. The TUM Weihenstephan Research Center for Brewing and Food Quality, the TUM Central Institute for Nutrition and Food Research and the TUM Hans Eisenmann Center for Agricultural Sciences belong to the Technical University of Munich. The Bavarian State Institute of Agriculture and the Bavarian State Institute of Forestry and Forestry are authorities of the Free State of Bavaria. 

Other non-university institutions include the German Research Institute for Food Chemistry, the Fraunhofer Institute for Process Engineering and Packaging, DEULA Bavaria and the IZB Freising-Weihenstephan start-up center for green biotechnology. 

In addition to the natural sciences and technology, there are facilities in the area of religious education. The Institut für Theologische und Pastorale Fortbildung Freising is dedicated to the continuing education of pastoral counselors. The Kardinal-Döpfner-Haus educational center is also located in the former residence on the Domberg. Further offers are provided by the Katholisches Kreisbildungswerk and the Pallotti-Haus, a Christian educational house and therapy center.

=== Libraries ===
The oldest library in Freising is the Freising Cathedral Library, located on the Domberg. This was founded by Bishop Arbeo and is the central library of the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising and one of the largest church libraries in Germany. The city library was founded in 1959. The central library of the Weihenstephan-Triesdorf University of Applied Sciences is located in the Hofgarten in Weihenstephan. Also in Weihenstephan is a branch library of the University Library of the Technical University of Munich. 

=== City archive ===
The Stadtarchiv Freising is a scientific institution of the city of Freising. It holds documents from the 14th century to the present day. It has existed as an institution since 1909. It is a public institution, open to all citizens and offers a reference library with about 4500 volumes in a reading room.

Since 2003, the Freising Municipal Archives have been temporarily located in the &quot;Haus der Vereine&quot; (House of Associations), a barracks building of the Jägerkaserne (Vimy Barracks from 1938), which was built in 1906 and has since been abandoned. It will remain in this listed building until a new building is realized in Fischergasse, east of the former prison.

<text>In mathematics, Gromov–Hausdorff convergence, named after Mikhail Gromov and Felix Hausdorff, is a notion for convergence of metric spaces which is a generalization of Hausdorff distance.

==Gromov–Hausdorff distance==

The Gromov–Hausdorff distance was introduced by David Edwards in 1975, and it was later rediscovered and generalized by Mikhail Gromov in 1981. This distance measures how far two compact metric spaces are from being isometric. If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are two compact metric spaces, then &quot;dGH&quot; (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) is defined to be the infimum of all numbers &quot;d&quot;&quot;H&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), &quot;g&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;)) for all (compact) metric spaces &quot;M&quot; and all isometric embeddings &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;M&quot; and &quot;g&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;M&quot;. Here &quot;d&quot;&quot;H&quot; denotes Hausdorff distance between subsets in &quot;M&quot; and the &quot;isometric embedding&quot; is understood in the global sense, i.e. it must preserve all distances, not only infinitesimally small ones; for example no compact Riemannian manifold admits such an embedding into Euclidean space of the same dimension.

The Gromov–Hausdorff distance turns the set of all isometry classes of compact metric spaces into a metric space, called Gromov–Hausdorff space, and it therefore defines a notion of convergence for sequences of compact metric spaces, called Gromov–Hausdorff convergence. A metric space to which such a sequence converges is called the Gromov–Hausdorff limit of the sequence.

==Some properties of Gromov–Hausdorff space==

The Gromov–Hausdorff space is path-connected, complete, and separable. It is also geodesic, i.e., any two of its points are the endpoints of a minimizing geodesic. In the global sense, the Gromov–Hausdorff space is totally heterogeneous, i.e., its isometry group is trivial, but locally there are many nontrivial isometries.

==Pointed Gromov–Hausdorff convergence==

The pointed Gromov–Hausdorff convergence is an analog of Gromov–Hausdorff convergence appropriate for non-compact spaces. A pointed metric space is a pair (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;p&quot;) consisting of a metric space &quot;X&quot; and point &quot;p&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. A sequence (&quot;Xn, pn&quot;) of pointed metric spaces converges to a pointed metric space (&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;p&quot;) if, for each &quot;R&quot; &gt; 0, the sequence of closed &quot;R&quot;-balls around &quot;pn&quot; in &quot;Xn&quot; converges to the closed &quot;R&quot;-ball around &quot;p&quot; in &quot;Y&quot; in the usual Gromov–Hausdorff sense.

==Applications==

The notion of Gromov–Hausdorff convergence was used by Gromov to prove that
any discrete group with polynomial growth is virtually nilpotent (i.e. it contains a nilpotent subgroup of finite index). See Gromov&#x27;s theorem on groups of polynomial growth. (Also see D. Edwards for an earlier work.)
The key ingredient in the proof was the observation that for the
Cayley graph of a group with polynomial growth a sequence of rescalings converges in the pointed Gromov–Hausdorff sense.

Another simple and very useful result in Riemannian geometry is Gromov&#x27;s compactness theorem, which states that
the set of Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature ≥ &quot;c&quot; and diameter ≤ &quot;D&quot; is relatively compact in the Gromov–Hausdorff metric. The limit spaces are metric spaces. Additional properties on the length spaces have been proven by Cheeger and Colding.

The Gromov–Hausdorff distance metric has been applied in the field of computer graphics and computational geometry to find correspondences between different shapes. It also has been applied in the problem of motion planning in robotics.

The Gromov–Hausdorff distance has been used by Sormani to prove the stability of the Friedmann model in Cosmology. This model of cosmology is not stable with respect to smooth variations of the metric.

In a special case, the concept of Gromov–Hausdorff limits is closely related to large-deviations theory.

<doc id="482369" wikidata="Q136834" url="?curid=482369" title="Zvenigorod">
<text>Zvenigorod () is a town in the Moscow Oblast of western Russia. In 2010 it had a population of about 16,000.

==History==

The town&#x27;s name is based either on a personal name (cf. Zvenislav, Zvenimir) or on a hydronym (cf. the Zvinech, Zvinyaka, Zveniga Rivers); the derivation from &quot;town of ringing (bells)&quot; is a folk etymology.

The community has existed since the 12th century, although its first written mention is dated around 1339, in the last will of Grand Duke of Moscow Ivan I Daniilovich Kalita, in which he says: &quot;Thus, I pass on to my son Ivan: Zvenigorod, Kremchina, Ruza...&quot; In the historical records, or annals (лéтопись [letopis&#x27;] in Russian), Zvenigorod is first mentioned around 1382, soon after khan Tokhtamysh burnt down Moscow, and destroyed a number of towns on the way, including Zvenigorod.

Zvenigorod rose to prominence in the late 14th century after it was bequeathed by Dmitry Donskoy to his second son Yuri, who founded his residence on the steep bank of the Moskva River. The local kremlin, called Gorodok, contains the only fully preserved example of 14th-century Muscovite architecture, the Dormition Cathedral (1399). The cathedral&#x27;s interior features frescoes attributed to Andrei Rublev.

Zvenigorod is primarily remembered for internecine wars waged by Yuri&#x27;s sons for control of Moscow during the reign of their cousin Vasily II (1425–1462). After their party was defeated, the town was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow.

Zvenigorod was granted town rights in 1784. By the late 19th century, the town gained popularity among the intelligentsia as a fashionable banlieue of Moscow. Many extravagant dachas were built in the neighbourhood. Some of these house museums of Sergey Taneyev, Anton Chekhov, and Isaac Levitan.

During World War II Zvenigorod was near, or on the frontline in the 1941-2 Battle of Moscow.

===Savvino-Storozhevsky Monastery===

 The Storozhi Monastery near Zvenigorod was established in 1398 by St. Savva, one of the first disciples of Sergius of Radonezh. The oldest church is the katholikon completed in 1405 and dedicated to the feast of the Nativity of the Theotokos. In 1650, the monastery was chosen by Tsar Alexis as his suburban residence. In five years, they constructed a white-stone royal palace and a festive chamber for tsaritsa. The compound was encircled with stone walls and towers, patterned after those of the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius. Particularly noteworthy is a large belfry, erected in four bays in 1650 and crowned with three tents and a clocktower. A church over the holy gates was consecrated to the Holy Trinity in 1652.

After the death of Feodor III, who spent most of his time there, the monastery declined. In May 1918, when the Bolsheviks tried to seize the relics of St. Savva, several persons were shot dead. In 1985, the cloister was assigned to the Danilov Monastery in Moscow. St. Savva&#x27;s relics were returned to the monastery in 1998.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Zvenigorod Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Zvenigorod Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Zvenigorod Urban Okrug.

<doc id="482371" wikidata="Q15038173" url="?curid=482371" title="Glass cockpit">
<text>A glass cockpit is an aircraft cockpit that features an array of electronic (digital) flight instrument displays, typically large LCD screens, rather than traditional analog dials and gauges. While a traditional cockpit relies on numerous mechanical gauges (nicknamed &quot;steam gauges&quot;) to display information, a glass cockpit uses several multi-function displays and a primary flight display driven by flight management systems, that can be adjusted to show flight information as needed. This simplifies aircraft operation and navigation and allows pilots to focus only on the most pertinent information. They are also popular with airline companies as they usually eliminate the need for a flight engineer, saving costs. In recent years the technology has also become widely available in small aircraft.

As aircraft displays have modernized, the sensors that feed them have modernized as well. Traditional gyroscopic flight instruments have been replaced by electronic attitude and heading reference systems (AHRS) and air data computers (ADCs), improving reliability and reducing cost and maintenance. GPS receivers are usually integrated into glass cockpits.

Early glass cockpits, found in the McDonnell Douglas MD-80, Boeing 737 Classic, ATR 42, ATR 72 and in the Airbus A300-600 and A310, used electronic flight instrument systems (EFIS) to display attitude and navigational information only, with traditional mechanical gauges retained for airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, and engine performance. The Boeing 757 and 767-200/-300 introduced an electronic engine-indicating and crew-alerting system (EICAS) for monitoring engine performance while retaining mechanical gauges for airspeed, altitude and vertical speed.

Later glass cockpits, found in the Boeing 737NG, 747-400, 767-400, 777, Airbus A320, later Airbuses, Ilyushin Il-96 and Tupolev Tu-204 have completely replaced the mechanical gauges and warning lights in previous generations of aircraft. While glass cockpit-equipped aircraft throughout the late 20th century still retained analog altimeters, attitude, and airspeed indicators as standby instruments in case the EFIS displays failed, more modern aircraft have increasingly been using digital standby instruments as well, such as the integrated standby instrument system.

== History ==
Glass cockpits originated in military aircraft in the late 1960s and early 1970s; an early example is the Mark II avionics of the F-111D (first ordered in 1967, delivered from 1970 to 1973), which featured a multi-function display.

Prior to the 1970s, air transport operations were not considered sufficiently demanding to require advanced equipment like electronic flight displays. Also, computer technology was not at a level where sufficiently light and powerful electronics were available. The increasing complexity of transport aircraft, the advent of digital systems and the growing air traffic congestion around airports began to change that.

The Boeing 2707 was one of the earliest commercial aircraft designed with a glass cockpit. Most cockpit instruments were still analog, but cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays were to be used for the attitude indicator and horizontal situation indicator (HSI). However, the 2707 was cancelled in 1971 after insurmountable technical difficulties and ultimately the end of project funding by the US government.

The average transport aircraft in the mid-1970s had more than one hundred cockpit instruments and controls, and the primary flight instruments were already crowded with indicators, crossbars, and symbols, and the growing number of cockpit elements were competing for cockpit space and pilot attention. As a result, NASA conducted research on displays that could process the raw aircraft system and flight data into an integrated, easily understood picture of the flight situation, culminating in a series of flights demonstrating a full glass cockpit system.

The success of the NASA-led glass cockpit work is reflected in the total acceptance of electronic flight displays. The safety and efficiency of flights have been increased with improved pilot understanding of the aircraft&#x27;s situation relative to its environment (or &quot;situational awareness&quot;).

By the end of the 1990s, liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels were increasingly favored among aircraft manufacturers because of their efficiency, reliability and legibility. Earlier LCD panels suffered from poor legibility at some viewing angles and poor response times, making them unsuitable for aviation. Modern aircraft such as the Boeing 737 Next Generation, 777, 717, 747-400ER, 747-8F 767-400ER, 747-8, and 787, Airbus A320 family (later versions), A330 (later versions), A340-500/600, A340-300 (later versions), A380 and A350 are fitted with glass cockpits consisting of LCD units.
The glass cockpit has become standard equipment in airliners, business jets, and military aircraft. It was fitted into NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle orbiters &quot;Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Columbia&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;, and &quot;Endeavour&quot;, and the Russian Soyuz TMA model spacecraft that were launched for the first time in 2002. By the end of the century glass cockpits began appearing in general aviation aircraft as well. In 2003, Cirrus Design&#x27;s SR20 and SR22 became the first light aircraft equipped with glass cockpits, which they made standard on all Cirrus aircraft. By 2005, even basic trainers like the Piper Cherokee and Cessna 172 were shipping with glass cockpits as options (which nearly all customers chose), as well as many modern utility aircraft such as the Diamond DA42. The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II features a &quot;panoramic cockpit display&quot; touchscreen that replaces most of the switches and toggles found in an aircraft cockpit. The civilian Cirrus Vision SF50 has the same, which they call a &quot;Perspective Touch&quot; glass cockpit.

== Uses ==

=== Commercial aviation ===
Unlike the previous era of glass cockpits—where designers merely copied the look and feel of conventional electromechanical instruments onto cathode-ray tubes—the new displays represent a true departure. They look and behave very similarly to other computers, with windows and data that can be manipulated with point-and-click devices. They also add terrain, approach charts, weather, vertical displays, and 3D navigation images.

The improved concepts enable aircraft makers to customize cockpits to a greater degree than previously. All of the manufacturers involved have chosen to do so in one way or another—such as using a trackball, thumb pad or joystick as a pilot-input device in a computer-style environment. Many of the modifications offered by the aircraft manufacturers improve situational awareness and customize the human-machine interface to increase safety.

Modern glass cockpits might include synthetic vision systems (SVS) or enhanced flight vision systems (EFVS). Synthetic vision systems display a realistic 3D depiction of the outside world (similar to a flight simulator), based on a database of terrain and geophysical features in conjunction with the attitude and position information gathered from the aircraft navigational systems. Enhanced flight vision systems add real-time information from external sensors, such as an infrared camera.

All new airliners such as the Airbus A380, Boeing 787 and private jets such as Bombardier Global Express and Learjet use glass cockpits.

=== General aviation ===
Many modern general aviation aircraft are available with glass cockpits. Systems such as the Garmin G1000 are now available on many new GA aircraft, including the classic Cessna 172. Many small aircraft can also be modified post-production to replace analogue instruments.

Glass cockpits are also popular as a retrofit for older private jets and turboprops such as Dassault Falcons, Raytheon Hawkers, Bombardier Challengers, Cessna Citations, Gulfstreams, King Airs, Learjets, Astras, and many others. Aviation service companies work closely with equipment manufacturers to address the needs of the owners of these aircraft.

=== Consumer, research, hobby &amp; recreational aviation ===

Today, smartphones and tablets use mini-applications, or &quot;apps&quot;, to remotely control complex devices, by WiFi radio interface. They demonstrate how the &quot;glass cockpit&quot; idea is being applied to consumer devices. Applications include toy-grade UAVs which use the display and touch screen of a tablet or smartphone to employ every aspect of the &quot;glass cockpit&quot; for instrument display, and fly-by-wire for aircraft control.

=== Spaceflight ===
The glass cockpit idea made news in 1980s trade magazines, like &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot;, when NASA announced that it would be replacing most of the electro-mechanical flight instruments in the space shuttles with glass cockpit components. The articles mentioned how glass cockpit components had the added benefit of being a few hundred pounds lighter than the original flight instruments and support systems used in the Space Shuttles. The was the first orbiter to be retrofitted with a glass cockpit in 2000 with the launch of STS-101. &quot;Columbia&quot; was the second orbiter with a glass cockpit on STS-109 in 2002, followed by &quot;Discovery&quot; in 2005 with STS-114, and &quot;Endeavour&quot; in 2007 with STS-118.

NASA&#x27;s Orion spacecraft will use glass cockpits derived from Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

== Safety ==

As aircraft operation depends on glass cockpit systems, flight crews must be trained to deal with failures. The Airbus A320 family has seen fifty incidents where several flight displays were lost.

On 25 January 2008, United Airlines Flight 731 experienced a serious glass-cockpit blackout, losing half of the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) displays as well as all radios, transponders, Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), and attitude indicators. The pilots were able to land at Newark Airport without radio contact in good weather and daylight conditions.

Airbus has offered an optional fix, which the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has suggested to the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as mandatory, but the FAA has yet to make it a requirement. A preliminary NTSB factsheet is available. Due to the possibility of a blackout, glass cockpit aircraft also have an integrated standby instrument system that includes (at a minimum) an artificial horizon, altimeter and airspeed indicator. It is electronically separate from the main instruments and can run for several hours on a backup battery.

In 2010, the NTSB published a study done on 8,000 general aviation light aircraft. The study found that, although aircraft equipped with glass cockpits had a lower overall accident rate, they also had a larger chance of being involved in a fatal accident. The NTSB Chairman said in response to the study:

<text>Ilam (; ) is a Kurdish city in the Central District of Ilam County, Ilam province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district. The Kabir Kuh mountain range lies east of the city. To the west, it borders Iraq.

==Demographics==
===Language===
Language composition:

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 155,289 in 34,549 households. The following census in 2011 counted 172,213 people in 42,613 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the rural district as 194,030 people in 53,581 households.

==Climate==
Ilam is situated in the cold mountainous region of Iran at a height of above mean sea level. It is located in the west of Iran at a latitude of 33° 38´ north and longitude of 46° 26´ east. Although this city is surrounded by mountains, its climate is also affected by deserts from the west and the south. This region presents a highly variable annual weather profile. Heavy showers or snow in the winter and dusty, brutally hot, dry weather in the summer are normal for this region. Monthly rainfalls have been as high as in March 1974, whilst daily rainfalls have reached on 26 February 1991. Temperatures have ranged from a high of on 20 August 1975 to a low of on 5 February 1974.

Ilam&#x27;s climate is classed under the Köppen climate classification as a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) with continental influences.


==Architecture==
Like many other regions of Iran, architecture in Ilam includis consists of a mix of both traditional and contemporary periods. Although easy access to fossil fuels and electricity may have aided the transition in Iranian architecture in other regions of Iran from its traditional to modern styles, the increasing population of Ilam may have also played a role in this transition.

The Governor Castle, Falahaty Mansion and The Mirgholam Castle are examples of some surviving traditional buildings in Ilam. The courtyard dwelling is the main type of the buildings of this period. This type of building was accepted as the main building type over all Iran for both climatic and cultural reasons. Brick is the main constructional material in these buildings. The &quot;passive thermal techniques&quot; indicated for the Iranian traditional buildings are commonly used in these buildings.

The Governor Castle of Ilam was built in type of courtyard. Adding shade and moisture by using green landscape, high trees and a pond, were the main passive techniques used in this building to reduce the temperature in summer.
The Mirgholam Castle of Ilam presents a classic Iranian courtyard. The garden and the pound were the main elements of this type of buildings. The Falahaty Mansion used a pitched roof as it was regular beside the flat roofs in the traditional buildings in Ilam earlier.

==Colleges and universities==
Ilam contains the following universities:
* Ilam University of Medical Sciences
* University of Ilam
* Islamic Azad University of Ilam
* Safir Danesh
* Farhangian University, &quot;Shahid Modares Campus of Ilam (Men)&quot; and &quot;Imam Jafar -e- Sadiqh Campus of Ilam (Women)&quot;

<text>Gush Etzion (, &quot;&quot; Etzion Bloc) is a cluster of Israeli settlements located in the Judaean Mountains, directly south of Jerusalem and Bethlehem in the West Bank. The core group includes four Jewish agricultural villages that were founded in 1943–1947, and destroyed by the Arab Legion before the outbreak of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, in the Kfar Etzion massacre. The area was left outside of Israel with the 1949 armistice lines. These settlements were rebuilt after the 1967 Six-Day War, along with new communities that have expanded the area of the Etzion Bloc. , Gush Etzion consisted of 22 settlements with a population of 70,000.

The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli and US governments dispute this.

== History ==

The four core original settlements of Gush Etzion were Kfar Etzion (founded in 1943), Massu&#x27;ot Yitzhak (1945), Ein Tzurim (1946) and Revadim (1947); the land area of all four were located within the village boundaries of Khirbet Beit Zakariyyah. From November 29, 1947, Kfar Etzion was under siege and cut off from Jerusalem. On May 13, 1948, when the village surrendered, 127 Jewish inhabitants were massacred by local village irregulars, with the possible involvement of the Arab Legion. The other villages surrendered the next day. The inhabitants were taken prisoner and the homes were plundered and burned.

The establishment, defense and fall of Gush Etzion have been described as &quot;one of the major episodes of the State of Israel-in-the-making&quot;, playing a significant role in Israeli collective memory. The motivation for resettling the region is not so much ideological, political or security-related as symbolic, linked in the Israeli psyche to the massive loss of life (1% of its total population) in the 1947–1949 Palestine war.

=== Settlements in Mandatory Palestine ===


In 1927, a group of religious Yemenite Jews founded an agricultural village they named Migdal Eder (), based on a biblical quotation (). The land had been purchased in 1925 by Zikhron David, a private Jewish land holding company at a site between Bethlehem and Hebron that fell between the zones of influence of the local Arab clans. This early community did not flourish, mainly due to economic hardships and escalating tension with neighboring Arab communities. Two years later, during the 1929 Palestine riots and recurring hostilities, Migdal Eder was attacked and destroyed. Residents of the neighboring Palestinian village of Beit Ummar sheltered the farmers, but they could not return to their land.

In 1932, a Jewish businessman of German extraction, Shmuel Yosef Holtzmann, provided financial backing for another attempt at resettling the area, through a company named El HaHar (&quot;To the Mountain&quot;). The kibbutz established there in 1935 was named Kfar Etzion, in his honor (the German word &quot;Holz&quot; means &quot;wood&quot;, which is &quot;etz&quot; עץ in Hebrew). The 1936–1939 Arab revolt made life intolerable for the residents, who returned to Jerusalem in 1937. The Jewish National Fund organized a third attempt at settlement in 1943 with the refounding of Kfar Etzion by members of a religious group called &quot;Kvutzat Avraham&quot;. Despite the rocky soil, shortage of potable water, harsh winters, and constant threat of attack, this group managed to succeed.

Their isolation was somewhat relieved by the establishment in 1945 of Masu&#x27;ot Yitzhak and Ein Tzurim, populated by members of the religious Bnei Akiva movement and Religious Kibbutz Movement. Against the backdrop of an impending struggle for Israeli independence, the secular Hashomer Hatzair movement founded a fourth kibbutz, Revadim. A religious center, Neve Ovadia, was also founded by the bloc&#x27;s members. By the start of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Etzion bloc numbered 450 residents and stretched over an area of .

=== Civil war and Arab–Israeli War ===


On November 29, 1947, the United Nations approved the Partition Plan. The bloc fell within the area allotted to a proposed Arab state. The Haganah command decided not to leave the bloc. Arab hostilities began almost immediately, and travel to Jerusalem became exceedingly difficult. For five months the bloc was besieged, first by Arab irregulars, and then by the Jordanian Arab Legion. Throughout the winter hostilities intensified and several relief convoys from the Haganah in Jerusalem were destroyed in ambushes. For 47 days the armed conflict was intense. In January, the women and children were evacuated with British assistance. An emergency reinforcement convoy put together by the Haganah and attempting to get to Gush Etzion under cover of darkness was discovered; all 35 members were massacred. Despite some resupply flights by Piper Cubs out of Tel Aviv landing onto an improvised airfield, adequate supplies were not getting in.

On March 27, land communication with the Yishuv was severed completely when the Nabi Daniel Convoy was ambushed on its return journey to Jerusalem. In the following months, Arab irregular forces continued small-scale attacks against the bloc, which the Haganah was able to effectively withstand. At times, the Haganah forces, commanded by Uzi Narkiss, ambushed Arab military convoys—and, according to Morris, also Arab civilian traffic and British military convoys—on the road between Jerusalem and Hebron. The defenders of Gush Etzion and the central command in Jerusalem mulled evacuation, but, although they had very few arms, a decision was made to hold out due to their strategic location as the only Jewish-held position on Jerusalem&#x27;s southern approach from Hebron.

==== Gush Etzion massacre ====
On May 12, the commander of Kfar Etzion requested from the Central Command in Jerusalem permission to evacuate the kibbutz, but was told to stay. Later in the day, the Arabs captured the Russian Orthodox monastery, which the Haganah used as a perimeter fortress for the Kfar Etzion area, killing twenty-four of its thirty-two defenders. On May 13, a massive attack began, involving parts of two Arab Legion infantry companies, light artillery and local irregular support, attacking from four directions. The kibbutz fell within a day; the Arab forces massacred 127 of the 133 surrendering defenders. The total number of dead during the final assault, including those killed in the massacre and those who committed suicide, was estimated to be between 75 and 250. Only three men and one woman survived. The following day, the day Israel declared its independence, the three other kibbutzim surrendered. The Arab Legion took 320 persons as prisoners of war and held them in Jordan for a year before releasing them.

=== Interim period (1949–1967) ===
In May 1948, the women and children evacuated from the bloc before the battle were taken to the Ratisbonne Monastery in Jerusalem. In June 1948, when the road to Jerusalem was opened, they were moved to Petah Tikva for two months. The refugees lived at the Netzah Yisrael school until the school year began, later resettling in Giv&#x27;at Aliyah, a neighborhood in Jaffa organized like a kibbutz.

Four years later, the returning prisoners of war of the bloc founded Nir Etzion in the Mount Carmel area near Haifa. Nir Etzion sought to accept the majority of the bloc&#x27;s children into it, but despite wishing to unite in a new place of residence, the issue of joining Nir Etzion was a matter of debate among the children, many of whom joined the Nahal military unit. The survivors of Masu&#x27;ot Yitzhak, Ein Tzurim, and Revadim founded their communities anew in Israel proper.

The interim period saw the rise of two movements designed to commemorate the fall of Gush Etzion, through songs, poetry, prose and cultural activities. Both the land of the bloc, and the events that transpired there in the war of 1948, became sacred to the descendants of the original participants. Some compared the story of the yearning to return to the bloc to the story of the Jews yearning to return to the Land of Israel. For 19 years, some survivors would gather on the Israel–Jordan frontier and gaze at the giant oak tree there in remembrance of what was. This became an annual gathering following the Independence Day ceremony (independence day was one day after the bloc had fallen). Poems and stories were written that humanized the lone tree. This was criticized by the novelist Haim Be&#x27;er, who called the bloc&#x27;s settlement movements a &quot;fervent cult&quot; and compared them to the Canaanites.

=== Re-establishment ===
As a result of the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel controlled the area of the former Etzion Bloc. A loose organisation of Bnei Akiva activists, who later coalesced into Gush Emunim, led by Hanan Porat, whose parents had been evacuated, petitioned Israeli prime minister Levi Eshkol to allow the reestablishment of Kfar Etzion. Among the supporters were Ra&#x27;anan Weitz, head of the settlement department in the Jewish Agency; minister of internal affairs Haim-Moshe Shapira; and Michael Hazani of the national religious movement. Supporters of the Allon Plan in the government were also in favor of settling the bloc. Eshkol was finally persuaded to give a green light to the plan. He was not decisive however, and the settlement movement did not immediately begin to build in the entire bloc, but only on the location of Kfar Etzion. Construction began in September, 1967. Since the government initially decided not to establish civilian settlements in the captured territories, the settlement was falsely portrayed as a Nahal outpost. According to Ra&#x27;anan Weitz&#x27;s plan, Kfar Etzion was meant to be one of three settlements in the new bloc, which also included Aviezer. A new middle village would be established on Jewish National Fund land purchased in the 1940s.

Weitz&#x27;s plan of creating a line of settlements based on territorial continuity, however, had a number of opponents: the descendants of the original residents of the bloc, the settlers on the ground, the Religious Kibbutz Movement, and the Israel Defense Forces. The IDF surveyed the land and decided that, &quot;Kfar Etzion B should be founded near the existing Kfar Etzion, and not near the former Green Line&quot;. This eventually was supported by defense minister Moshe Dayan, who envisioned five settlement points in the West Bank, one of them being the Etzion bloc. On September 30, 1968, the government gave permission to create a regional center and Hesder Yeshiva in Kfar Etzion, a major demand of the settlers and the final departure from the continuity plan.

In the same decision, the government appointed a committee for planning the settlement of the bloc. In accordance with the committee&#x27;s recommendations, Revadim and the settlement of Rosh Tzurim were founded on the former site of Ein Tzurim in July 1969, and Alon Shvut in June 1970. Many other settlements and two municipalities (Efrat and Beitar Illit) have been founded in the area of the historic Etzion bloc, and its name was taken for the greater Gush Etzion Regional Council.

Today there is a museum about the history of Gush Etzion.

== Today ==
Here is a list of communities in modern Gush Etzion.

=== Gush Etzion Junction ===
The entrance to the Gush Etzion bloc is the Gush Etzion Junction, which is located just west of the intersection of Route 60 and Route 367. The junction is located between Efrat and Alon Shvut and very close to Migdal Oz. It is the site of the Gush Etzion visitors&#x27; center, a gas station, an automotive repair shop, a Rami Levy discount supermarket, an electronics store, the Gush Etzion Winery (one minute towards Alon Shvut on the north side of the road), a bakery, natural foods store, eyeglass shop, clothing store and pizza / felafel / shawarma stands. Across the street are a nursery and car dealership. The junction is a popular hitchhiking post, both south to Hebron / Be&#x27;er Sheva and north to Jerusalem, as well as west towards Bet Shemesh and the coast) which has frequently been the site of attacks by Palestinians against Israeli citizens.

=== 2014 &quot;State land&quot; classifications ===

On 6 April and 25 August 2014, the Israeli Civil Administration declared 1,000 and 3,799 dunums of land respectively in the Bethlehem Governorate within the boundaries of Surif, Nahalin, Husan, Jab&#x27;a and Wadi Fukin villages as &quot;state land&quot;.
According to Peace Now, it was the largest confiscation of Palestinian land in three decades.

The United States responded to the announcement by rebuking Israel for taking measures that were &#x27;counter-productive&#x27; to the two-state solution in peace talks. The expropriation was also condemned by the United Nations, the United Kingdom, Egypt, France, Spain, Russia, the European Union, Turkey, Norway, Japan and Amnesty International.

As of September 2014, eight years after approving the 45 km stretch of barrier enclosing Gush Etzion, no progress had been made on it. The reclassified land would be on the Palestinian side of the barrier. On 21 September 2014, the government voted to not reauthorize the barrier in the Gush Etzion area.

<text>In mathematics, tetration (or hyper-4) is an operation based on iterated, or repeated, exponentiation. There is no standard notation for tetration, though Knuth&#x27;s up arrow notation formula_1 and the left-exponent formula_2 are common.

Under the definition as repeated exponentiation, formula_3 means formula_4, where &#x27; copies of&#x27; are iterated via exponentiation, right-to-left, i.e. the application of exponentiation formula_5 times. &#x27; is called the &quot;height&quot; of the function, while&#x27; is called the &quot;base,&quot; analogous to exponentiation. It would be read as &quot;the th tetration of &quot;. For example, 2 tetrated to 4 (or the fourth tetration of 2) is formula_6.

It is the next hyperoperation after exponentiation, but before pentation. The word was coined by Reuben Louis Goodstein from tetra- (four) and iteration.

Tetration is also defined recursively as
: formula_7
allowing for attempts to extend tetration to non-natural numbers such as real, complex, and ordinal numbers.

The two inverses of tetration are called [[#Super-root|super-root]] and [[#Super-logarithm|super-logarithm]], analogous to the nth root and the logarithmic functions. None of the three functions are elementary.

Tetration is used for the notation of very large numbers.

== Introduction ==
The first four hyperoperations are shown here, with tetration being considered the fourth in the series. The unary operation succession, defined as formula_8, is considered to be the zeroth operation.

#Addition formula_9 copies of 1 added to combined by succession.
#Multiplication formula_10 copies of combined by addition.
#Exponentiation formula_11 copies of combined by multiplication.
#Tetration formula_12 copies of combined by exponentiation, right-to-left.

Importantly, nested exponents are interpreted from the top down: means and not 

Succession, formula_13, is the most basic operation; while addition (formula_14) is a primary operation, for addition of natural numbers it can be thought of as a chained succession of formula_15 successors of formula_16; multiplication (formula_17) is also a primary operation, though for natural numbers it can analogously be thought of as a chained addition involving formula_15 numbers of formula_16. Exponentiation can be thought of as a chained multiplication involving formula_15 numbers of formula_16 and tetration (formula_22) as a chained power involving formula_15 numbers formula_16. Each of the operations above are defined by iterating the previous one; however, unlike the operations before it, tetration is not an elementary function.

The parameter formula_16 is referred to as the base, while the parameter formula_15 may be referred to as the height. In the original definition of tetration, the height parameter must be a natural number; for instance, it would be illogical to say &quot;three raised to itself negative five times&quot; or &quot;four raised to itself one half of a time.&quot; However, just as addition, multiplication, and exponentiation can be defined in ways that allow for extensions to real and complex numbers, several attempts have been made to generalize tetration to negative numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers. One such way for doing so is using a recursive definition for tetration; for any positive real formula_27 and non-negative integer formula_28, we can define formula_29 recursively as:
: formula_30
The recursive definition is equivalent to repeated exponentiation for natural heights; however, this definition allows for extensions to the other heights such as formula_31, formula_32, and formula_33 as well – many of these extensions are areas of active research.

== Terminology ==
There are many terms for tetration, each of which has some logic behind it, but some have not become commonly used for one reason or another. Here is a comparison of each term with its rationale and counter-rationale.

* The term &quot;tetration&quot;, introduced by Goodstein in his 1947 paper &quot;Transfinite Ordinals in Recursive Number Theory&quot; (generalizing the recursive base-representation used in Goodstein&#x27;s theorem to use higher operations), has gained dominance. It was also popularized in Rudy Rucker&#x27;s &quot;Infinity and the Mind&quot;.
* The term &quot;superexponentiation&quot; was published by Bromer in his paper &quot;Superexponentiation&quot; in 1987. It was used earlier by Ed Nelson in his book Predicative Arithmetic, Princeton University Press, 1986.
* The term &quot;hyperpower&quot; is a natural combination of &quot;hyper&quot; and &quot;power&quot;, which aptly describes tetration. The problem lies in the meaning of &quot;hyper&quot; with respect to the hyperoperation sequence. When considering hyperoperations, the term &quot;hyper&quot; refers to all ranks, and the term &quot;super&quot; refers to rank 4, or tetration. So under these considerations &quot;hyperpower&quot; is misleading, since it is only referring to tetration.
* The term &quot;power tower&quot; is occasionally used, in the form &quot;the power tower of order &quot; for formula_34. Exponentiation is easily misconstrued: note that the operation of raising to a power is right-associative (see below). Tetration is iterated &quot;exponentiation&quot; (call this right-associative operation ^), starting from the top right side of the expression with an instance a^a (call this value c). Exponentiating the next leftward a (call this the &#x27;next base&#x27; b), is to work leftward after obtaining the new value b^c. Working to the left, use the next a to the left, as the base b, and evaluate the new b^c. &#x27;Descend down the tower&#x27; in turn, with the new value for c on the next downward step.

Owing in part to some shared terminology and similar notational symbolism, tetration is often confused with closely related functions and expressions. Here are a few related terms:

In the first two expressions is the &quot;base&quot;, and the number of times appears is the &quot;height&quot; (add one for ). In the third expression, is the &quot;height&quot;, but each of the bases is different.

Care must be taken when referring to iterated exponentials, as it is common to call expressions of this form iterated exponentiation, which is ambiguous, as this can either mean iterated powers or iterated exponentials.

== Notation ==
There are many different notation styles that can be used to express tetration. Some notations can also be used to describe other hyperoperations, while some are limited to tetration and have no immediate extension.

One notation above uses iterated exponential notation; this is defined in general as follows:

: formula_35 with s.

There are not as many notations for iterated exponentials, but here are a few:
== Examples ==
Because of the extremely fast growth of tetration, most values in the following table are too large to write in scientific notation. In these cases, iterated exponential notation is used to express them in base 10. The values containing a decimal point are approximate. Usually, the limit that can be calculated in a numerical calculation program such as Wolfram Alpha is 3↑↑4, and the number of digits up to 3↑↑5 can be expressed.
Remark: If does not differ from 10 by orders of magnitude, then for all formula_36. For example, formula_37 in the above table, and the difference is even smaller for the following rows.

== Extensions ==
Tetration can be extended in two different ways; in the equation formula_38, both the base and the height can be generalized using the definition and properties of tetration. Although the base and the height can be extended beyond the non-negative integers to different domains, including formula_39, complex functions such as formula_40, and heights of infinite , the more limited properties of tetration reduce the ability to extend tetration.

=== Extension of domain for bases ===
==== Base zero ====
The exponential formula_41 is not consistently defined. Thus, the tetrations formula_42 are not clearly defined by the formula given earlier. However, formula_43 is well defined, and exists:
:formula_44

Thus we could consistently define formula_45. This is analogous to defining formula_46.

Under this extension, formula_47, so the rule formula_48 from the original definition still holds.

==== Complex bases ====

Since complex numbers can be raised to powers, tetration can be applied to &quot;bases&quot; of the form (where and are real). For example, in with , tetration is achieved by using the principal branch of the natural logarithm; using Euler&#x27;s formula we get the relation:

: formula_49

This suggests a recursive definition for given any :
: formula_50

The following approximate values can be derived:
Solving the inverse relation, as in the previous section, yields the expected and , with negative values of giving infinite results on the imaginary axis. Plotted in the complex plane, the entire sequence spirals to the limit , which could be interpreted as the value where is infinite.

Such tetration sequences have been studied since the time of Euler, but are poorly understood due to their chaotic behavior. Most published research historically has focused on the convergence of the infinitely iterated exponential function. Current research has greatly benefited by the advent of powerful computers with fractal and symbolic mathematics software. Much of what is known about tetration comes from general knowledge of complex dynamics and specific research of the exponential map.

=== Extensions of the domain for different heights ===
==== Infinite heights ====

Tetration can be extended to infinite heights; i.e., for certain and values in formula_51, there exists a well defined result for an infinite . This is because for bases within a certain interval, tetration converges to a finite value as the height tends to infinity. For example, formula_52 converges to 2, and can therefore be said to be equal to 2. The trend towards 2 can be seen by evaluating a small finite tower:

: formula_53

In general, the infinitely iterated exponential formula_54, defined as the limit of formula_55 as goes to infinity, converges for , roughly the interval from 0.066 to 1.44, a result shown by Leonhard Euler. The limit, should it exist, is a positive real solution of the equation . Thus, . The limit defining the infinite exponential of does not exist when because the maximum of is . The limit also fails to exist when .

This may be extended to complex numbers with the definition:
: formula_56
where represents Lambert&#x27;s W function.

As the limit (if existent on the positive real line, i.e. for ) must satisfy we see that is (the lower branch of) the inverse function of .

==== Negative heights ====
We can use the recursive rule for tetration,
: formula_57

to prove formula_58:
: formula_59

Substituting −1 for gives
: formula_60.

Smaller negative values cannot be well defined in this way. Substituting −2 for in the same equation gives
: formula_61

which is not well defined. They can, however, sometimes be considered sets.

For formula_62, any definition of formula_63 is consistent with the rule because
: formula_64 for any formula_65.

==== Linear approximation for real heights ====

A linear approximation (solution to the continuity requirement, approximation to the differentiability requirement) is given by:
: formula_66

hence:
and so on. However, it is only piecewise differentiable; at integer values of the derivative is multiplied by formula_67. It is continuously differentiable for formula_68 if and only if formula_69. For example, using these methods formula_70 and formula_71

A main theorem in Hooshmand&#x27;s paper states: Let formula_72. If formula_73 is continuous and satisfies the conditions:

* formula_74
* formula_75 is differentiable on ,
* formula_76 is a nondecreasing or nonincreasing function on ,
* formula_77

then formula_75 is uniquely determined through the equation
: formula_79

where formula_80 denotes the fractional part of and formula_81 is the formula_82-iterated function of the function formula_83.

The proof is that the second through fourth conditions trivially imply that is a linear function on .

The linear approximation to natural tetration function formula_84 is continuously differentiable, but its second derivative does not exist at integer values of its argument. Hooshmand derived another uniqueness theorem for it which states:

If formula_85 is a continuous function that satisfies:

* formula_86
* formula_75 is convex on ,
* formula_88

then formula_89. [Here formula_89 is Hooshmand&#x27;s name for the linear approximation to the natural tetration function.]

The proof is much the same as before; the recursion equation ensures that formula_91 and then the convexity condition implies that formula_75 is linear on .

Therefore, the linear approximation to natural tetration is the only solution of the equation formula_93 and formula_94 which is convex on . All other sufficiently-differentiable solutions must have an inflection point on the interval .

==== Higher order approximations for real heights ====

Beyond linear approximations, a quadratic approximation (to the differentiability requirement) is given by:
: formula_95

which is differentiable for all formula_96, but not twice differentiable. For example, formula_97 If formula_69 this is the same as the linear approximation.

Because of the way it is calculated, this function does not &quot;cancel out&quot;, contrary to exponents, where formula_99. Namely,
: formula_100.

Just as there is a quadratic approximation, cubic approximations and methods for generalizing to approximations of degree also exist, although they are much more unwieldy.

==== Complex heights ====
In 2017, it was proven that there exists a unique function which is a solution of the equation and satisfies the additional conditions that and approaches the fixed points of the logarithm (roughly ) as approaches and that is holomorphic in the whole complex -plane, except the part of the real axis at . This proof confirms a previous conjecture. The construction of such a function was originally demonstrated by Kneser in 1950. The complex map of this function is shown in the figure at right. The proof also works for other bases besides &quot;e&quot;, as long as the base is greater than formula_101. Subsequent work extended the construction to all complex bases.
The requirement of the tetration being holomorphic is important for its uniqueness. Many functions can be constructed as
: formula_102

where and are real sequences which decay fast enough to provide the convergence of the series, at least at moderate values of .

The function satisfies the tetration equations , , and if and approach 0 fast enough it will be analytic on a neighborhood of the positive real axis. However, if some elements of or are not zero, then function has multitudes of additional singularities and cutlines in the complex plane, due to the exponential growth of sin and cos along the imaginary axis; the smaller the coefficients and are, the further away these singularities are from the real axis.

The extension of tetration into the complex plane is thus essential for the uniqueness; the real-analytic tetration is not unique.

==== Ordinal tetration ====
Tetration can be defined for ordinal numbers via transfinite induction. For all and all :
formula_103
formula_104
We denote the right hand side by formula_105. Suppose on the contrary that tetration is elementary recursive. formula_106 is also elementary recursive. By the above inequality, there is a constant such that formula_107. By letting formula_108, we have that formula_109, a contradiction.
== Inverse operations ==
Exponentiation has two inverse operations; roots and logarithms. Analogously, the inverses of tetration are often called the super-root, and the super-logarithm (In fact, all hyperoperations greater than or equal to 3 have analogous inverses); e.g., in the function formula_110, the two inverses are the cube super-root of and the super-logarithm base  of .

=== Super-root ===

The super-root is the inverse operation of tetration with respect to the base: if formula_111, then is an th super-root of (formula_112 or formula_113).

For example,
: formula_114

so 2 is the 4th super-root of 65,536 formula_115.

==== Square super-root ====

The &quot;2nd-order super-root&quot;, &quot;square super-root&quot;, or &quot;super square root&quot; has two equivalent notations, formula_116 and formula_117. It is the inverse of formula_118 and can be represented with the Lambert W function:

: formula_119 or
: formula_120

The function also illustrates the reflective nature of the root and logarithm functions as the equation below only holds true when formula_121:

: formula_122

Like square roots, the square super-root of may not have a single solution. Unlike square roots, determining the number of square super-roots of may be difficult. In general, if formula_123, then has two positive square super-roots between 0 and 1 calculated using formulas:formula_124; and if formula_125, then has one positive square super-root greater than 1 calculated using formulas: formula_126. If is positive and less than formula_127 it does not have any real square super-roots, but the formula given above yields countably infinitely many complex ones for any finite not equal to 1. The function has been used to determine the size of data clusters.

At formula_128:

==== Other super-roots ====

One of the simpler and faster formulas for a third-degree super-root is the recursive formula. If formula_129 then one can use:
* formula_130
* formula_131

For each integer , the function is defined and increasing for , and , so that the th super-root of , formula_112, exists for .

However, if the linear approximation above is used, then formula_133 if , so formula_134 cannot exist.

In the same way as the square super-root, terminology for other super-roots can be based on the normal roots: &quot;cube super-roots&quot; can be expressed as formula_135; the &quot;4th super-root&quot; can be expressed as formula_113; and the &quot;th super-root&quot; is formula_112. Note that formula_112 may not be uniquely defined, because there may be more than one root. For example, has a single (real) super-root if is &quot;odd&quot;, and up to two if is &quot;even&quot;.

Just as with the extension of tetration to infinite heights, the super-root can be extended to , being well-defined if . Note that formula_139 and thus that formula_140. Therefore, when it is well defined, formula_141 and, unlike normal tetration, is an elementary function. For example, formula_142.

It follows from the Gelfond–Schneider theorem that super-root formula_143 for any positive integer is either integer or transcendental, and formula_144 is either integer or irrational. It is still an open question whether irrational super-roots are transcendental in the latter case.

=== Super-logarithm ===

Once a continuous increasing (in ) definition of tetration, , is selected, the corresponding super-logarithm formula_145 or formula_146 is defined for all real numbers , and .

The function satisfies:
: formula_147

== Open questions ==
Other than the problems with the extensions of tetration, there are several open questions concerning tetration, particularly when concerning the relations between number systems such as integers and irrational numbers:
* It is not known whether there is an integer formula_148 for which is an integer, because we could not calculate precisely enough the numbers of digits after the decimal points of formula_149. It is similar for for formula_150, as we are not aware of any other methods besides some direct computation. In fact, since formula_151, then formula_152. Given formula_153 and formula_154, then formula_155 for formula_150. It is believed that is not an integer for any positive integer , due to the algebraic independence of formula_157, given Schanuel&#x27;s conjecture.
* It is not known whether is rational for any positive integer and positive non-integer rational . For example, it is not known whether the positive root of the equation is a rational number.
* It is not known whether or (defined using Kneser&#x27;s extension) are rationals or not.

== Applications ==

For each graph &quot;H&quot; on &quot;h&quot; vertices and each , define
:formula_158
Then each graph &quot;G&quot; on &quot;n&quot; vertices with at most copies of &quot;H&quot; can be made &quot;H&quot;-free by removing at most edges.

<doc id="482381" wikidata="Q487396" url="?curid=482381" title="Anathema (band)">
<text>Anathema were an English rock band from Liverpool. The group was formed in 1990 by Vincent and Daniel Cavanagh, bassist Jamie Cavanagh, drummer/keyboardist John Douglas, and vocalist Darren White.

The band maintained an active concert schedule throughout their career. They first toured in 1992 with the American death metal band Cannibal Corpse; they since performed throughout Europe, the United States, Central America, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Turkey. In the latter stages of their career, the band performed at notable venues such as London&#x27;s O2 Arena, Wembley Arena, and the London Palladium, as well as appearing on stage with Stephen Hawking at Starmus Festival 3.

Anathema released 11 studio albums, including &quot;Distant Satellites&quot; (2014), which included the song &quot;Anathema&quot;, named the Anthem of the Year at the third annual Progressive Music Awards. Three years later &quot;The Optimist&quot; was named Album of the Year at the Progressive Music Awards.

==History==

===1990–1995: &quot;Serenades&quot; and &quot;The Silent Enigma&quot;===
Anathema formed in 1990 as a doom metal band, initially going by the name Pagan Angel. In November of that year, the band recorded their first demo, entitled &quot;An Iliad of Woes&quot;. This demo caught the attention of several bands and labels from the English metal scene.
At the beginning of 1991, the band gained a lot of attention with the release of their second demo entitled &quot;All Faith Is Lost&quot;, resulting in a four-album deal with Peaceville Records. Their first release under the label was &quot;The Crestfallen&quot; EP in November 1992. They took the material from that album on the road, touring with Cannibal Corpse.

&quot;Serenades&quot;, Anathema&#x27;s debut LP, attracted a lot of mainstream attention, propelling their &quot;Sweet Tears&quot; music video onto the MTV playlist. Anathema&#x27;s first European tour was in 1994, and was closely followed by gigs at the Independent Rock Festival in Brazil.

In May 1995, vocalist Darren White parted with the band, eventually forming The Blood Divine. Rather than recruiting a new vocalist, the band decided that guitarist Vincent Cavanagh should assume White&#x27;s role. This new formation debuted by touring with Cathedral in the United Kingdom, and released &quot;The Silent Enigma&quot; soon after. It also showed the band starting to take a direction akin to gothic metal.

===1996–1999: &quot;Eternity&quot;, &quot;Alternative 4&quot;, and &quot;Judgement&quot;===
The release of &quot;Eternity&quot; came in 1996, relying more on atmospheric sounds, and starting the transition to clean vocals; the album &quot;Judgement&quot; would later consolidate this style. A European tour followed the album&#x27;s release.

The next member to leave the band was drummer John Douglas, who departed in the summer of 1997. He was replaced by Shaun Steels, formerly of Solstice, who would also later play drums for My Dying Bride.

&quot;Alternative 4&quot; was released in 1998. During this time the band underwent many line-up changes. Bassist/keyboardist/songwriter Duncan Patterson quit due to musical differences and was replaced by Dave Pybus of Dreambreed, a band which Duncan had played bass for during a short period, and not long after this Martin Powell (who had played keyboards and violin for My Dying Bride previously) joined the band for live performances. Finally, founding drummer John Douglas returned to the drums in place of Steels.

In June 1999, the album &quot;Judgement&quot; was released, marking Anathema&#x27;s complete shift from the doom metal genre, focusing instead on slower and more experimental songs. This new sound has been likened to artists such as Pink Floyd, Jeff Buckley, and to a lesser extent, Radiohead. Their songs continued to express a feeling of depression and, more often than not, desperation.

===2000–2009: &quot;A Fine Day to Exit&quot; and &quot;A Natural Disaster&quot;===

In 2000, Martin Powell switched positions with Cradle of Filth&#x27;s keyboardist Les Smith, who came to be an integral member of Anathema.

Shortly before the release of &quot;A Fine Day to Exit&quot;, Dave Pybus announced his departure from the band and later joined Cradle of Filth. He was replaced by touring bassist George Roberts, and later by Jamie Cavanagh.

In March 2002, Daniel Cavanagh announced his departure from the band, joining Duncan Patterson&#x27;s band Antimatter. However, later in April 2002 he changed his mind and rejoined Anathema for the release of &quot;A Natural Disaster&quot;, and started their European tour. This accelerated the changes in Anathema&#x27;s tone, towards the atmospheric and progressive, as exhibited in album tracks &quot;Flying&quot; and &quot;Violence&quot;.

Upon the closing of their label Music for Nations after its purchase by Sony BMG, Anathema found itself without a record label, despite having completed an extensive tour of the UK with popular Finnish rock band HIM in April 2006. During their search for a new label, the band adopted a more &#x27;DIY&#x27; approach to music release, embracing the internet and releasing songs via their own website, for which fans may donate a monetary sum of their own choice. Despite the obvious lack of label-based tour support, the band continued to play dates across Europe, and guitarist Danny Cavanagh also playing the odd low-key acoustic concert.

===2010–2013: &quot;We&#x27;re Here Because We&#x27;re Here&quot; and &quot;Weather Systems&quot;===

On 20 March 2010, Anathema announced on their website and Facebook page the release date of their next album. &quot;We&#x27;re Here Because We&#x27;re Here&quot; was released on 31 May 2010 on the Kscope label. John Douglas&#x27; sister Lee Douglas joined the band in the capacity of a vocalist during the recording of this album. She had previously performed on the two previous albums as a guest vocalist. In 2010 the band played the UK rock festival Download, alongside A Day to Remember and Bullet for My Valentine.

On 6 July 2011, it was announced on the band&#x27;s official page that their album of re-interpretations, &quot;Falling Deeper&quot;, would be released on 5 September 2011. The album was a follow-up to &quot;Hindsight&quot; and contained new orchestral versions of songs from the past, as well as a version of &quot;Everwake&quot; featuring the vocals of Anneke van Giersbergen. On 12 September 2011, Les Smith&#x27;s departure due to &quot;creative and musical differences&quot; was announced on the band&#x27;s website.

On 16 April 2012, the band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Weather Systems&quot;, was released via Kscope. The album entered the UK album charts at No. 50 and the German album charts at No. 19.

On 8 November 2012, Daniel Cavanagh announced on Anathema&#x27;s official website that Daniel Cardoso was joining in a full-time permanent basis, as a key element of the band. Cardoso and John Douglas both switch positions of keyboardist and drummer respectively.

On 2 December 2012, Anathema announced their first concert in India. Anathema has performed at IIT Madras as part of the Saarang Rock Show on 12 January 2013.

The band&#x27;s live album, named &quot;Universal&quot;, was released as a double vinyl album on 24 June 2013. The album is a recording of a special one-off gig at the ancient Roman theatre of Philippopolis in 2012, where the band were joined by the Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestra. The set was released on Blu-ray, DVD and CD under the name &quot;Universal&quot;, with an alternate track order, on 17 September 2013.
The band performed on drummer Mike Portnoy&#x27;s Progressive Nation at Sea tour aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line ship &quot;Pearl&quot; that sailed from the Port of Miami on 18 February 2014.

===2014–2020: &quot;Distant Satellites&quot;, &quot;The Optimist&quot;, and indefinite hiatus===
On 28 March 2014, the band announced their upcoming studio album would be called &quot;Distant Satellites&quot;. The album came out on 9 June 2014 on the Kscope label, and was produced by Christer-André Cederberg in Oslo, Norway. Several tracks were mixed by Steven Wilson (of Porcupine Tree). Different from previous albums is the use of more electronica on this album. The album was released in four different versions: CD, vinyl, media book, and a deluxe version. The band toured the album starting 22 May in Istanbul, Turkey, continuing throughout Europe and travelling to Australia for the first time to perform three dates during August 2014.

Following the success of their short Australian tour, an acoustic tour was announced for New Zealand and Australia in 2015. Daniel, Vincent and Lee performed these show without the other band members. Later that year, the band released an acoustic live album and video entitled &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot;, consisting in the record of a concert at the band&#x27;s hometown Liverpool Cathedral.

Anathema went on their Resonance Tour through Europe in April 2015. These concerts served as live retrospective efforts, featuring songs throughout their catalog, including from their debut album &quot;Serenades&quot;. Former vocalist Darren &quot;Daz&quot; White and former bassist/keyboardist Duncan Patterson joined the band on stage for these concerts.

In 2017, the band released &quot;The Optimist&quot;, which won Album of the Year at the Progressive Music Awards.

At the end of August 2019, it was announced that Anathema would be leaving the Kscope record label and had signed a new deal with Mascot Label Group. Anathema planned to release their 12th studio album in 2020. However, Anathema announced an indefinite hiatus on 22 September 2020.

===Daniel&#x27;s solo album &quot;Cellar Door&quot; and post-Anathema side-project Weather Systems===
Daniel Cavanagh has announced he is working on a solo album named &quot;Cellar Door&quot;, and has started a new musical project named Weather Systems. The project takes the name of Anathema&#x27;s 2012 album, and, according to a post on the Anathema Facebook page, &quot;the music will be a continuation of the previous band&#x27;s legacy&quot;.
In December 2021, it was posted on Anathema&#x27;s Facebook page that John Douglas had joined the Weather Systems project.

On 27 September 2024, the project released its debut album titled &quot;Ocean Without A Shore&quot;. Among others, it contains the songs titled &quot;Untouchable Part 3&quot; and &quot;Are You There? Part 2&quot;.

<doc id="482382" wikidata="Q3459517" url="?curid=482382" title="Stuart Hall (presenter)">
<text>James Stuart Hall (born 25 December 1929) is an English former media personality and convicted sex offender.
He presented regional news programmes for the BBC in North West England in the 1960s and 1970s, while becoming known nationally for presenting the game show &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot; (which was part of the international &quot;Jeux sans frontières&quot; franchise). Hall&#x27;s later career mainly involved football reporting on BBC Radio. In June 2013, he was convicted of multiple sexual offences against children, effectively ending his media and broadcasting career.

==Early life==
Stuart Hall was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, the eldest son of baker James Stuart Hall, and his Irish-born wife, Mary (née Hennessey). He was brought up in Hyde, Cheshire, and Glossop, Derbyshire, attending the local grammar school. Hall directed plays when at school and chaired its debating society. While studying at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, he was offered a playing contract with Crystal Palace F.C. but turned it down because of the low wages.

==Career==

===Journalism===
Hall joined the BBC in 1959 as a general reporter on &quot;Radio Newsreel&quot; and a sports journalist on &quot;Sports Report&quot;. Between 1965 and 1990, he presented BBC North West&#x27;s regional news programmes produced in Manchester, originally called &quot;Look North&quot;, then &quot;Look North West&quot; and finally &quot;North West Tonight&quot;, alongside John Mundy. During the run of &quot;Nationwide&quot; (1969–83), Hall became known nationally through live link-ups.

In 1990, Hall moved to ITV Granada&#x27;s &quot;Granada Reports&quot;, where he worked with Bob Greaves in a slot titled &quot;Greaves and Hall&quot;. During the 2000s, he joined Channel M, a local television station in Manchester, presenting &quot;Hall&#x27;s Heroes&quot; on Channel M News.

===Entertainment===
Between 1972 and 1982, Hall became particularly well known as the presenter of &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot; on BBC1 and its European equivalent, &quot;Jeux Sans Frontières&quot;. He would often be overcome by laughter at the slapstick antics of the competitors. This led to his becoming a popular subject for impersonation. After the series was cancelled, Hall presented the one-off &quot;Grand Knockout Tournament&quot; (also known as &quot;It&#x27;s a Royal Knockout&quot;) in 1987, and retained the rights to the programme and some costumes, which enabled him to host similar programmes and events in other parts of the world.

Hall also presented &quot;Quiz Ball&quot; (a BBC football quiz show) between 1971 and 1972; was the original host of the long-running sports quiz &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; (at that time only broadcast in the North of England); presented &quot;Going, Going, Gone&quot; (a BBC antiques quiz show) in the late 1990s; and provided the voice-over for &quot;God&#x27;s Gift&quot; for Granada Television. In 2008, Hall provided his voice for a special segment on &quot;Les Dennis&#x27;s Home Video Heroes&quot;. In a typical episode, he would be shown a series of funny clips and there would be a &#x27;laugh-ometer&#x27; at the bottom of the screen measuring how much he laughed.

===Football===
As a football reporter, Hall is associated with the phrase &quot;The Beautiful Game&quot;, which he popularised, and which he reports he coined in his youth to describe football. As a lifelong Manchester City supporter, he admired prolific goal-scorer Peter Doherty&#x27;s style of playing and consequently used the phrase &quot;The Beautiful Game&quot; to describe Doherty.

The first football match that Hall reported on was Sheffield Wednesday versus Leicester City at Hillsborough in 1958, where the teams shared eight goals. Despite his love of Manchester City, he has affectionately referred to their former home ground Maine Road as the &#x27;Theatre of Base Comedy&#x27;, an allusion to City&#x27;s Manchester rivals Manchester United&#x27;s home ground Old Trafford, which is known as the &#x27;Theatre of Dreams&#x27;.

During the 1970s, Hall developed a relationship with Liverpool manager Bill Shankly and became a regular visitor to the Anfield &#x27;Boot Room&#x27;. His relationship with Bob Paisley enabled him to pull off a coup, capturing the team&#x27;s first European Cup final in 1977 in Rome. Smuggled into the ground as a club employee, Hall spent the match on the substitutes&#x27; bench wearing the No 14 shirt. This enabled him to get inside television footage of the team&#x27;s 3–1 win over Borussia Mönchengladbach. As a television presenter with &quot;Look North&quot;, Hall used to turn out for benefit matches, scoring twice against Gordon Banks in Eddie Hopkinson&#x27;s testimonial at Bolton Wanderers.

Hall worked as a football reporter for BBC Radio 5 Live for some years. On 10 December 2009, Radio 5 Live presented a special programme, &quot;Stuart Hall Night&quot;, broadcast live from the City of Manchester Stadium.

==Controversies==
===Drugged policeman case===
In 1978 Hall was called as a prosecution witness during the trial of a policeman, who was accused of driving &quot;while unfit through drink and drugs&quot;. Prior to his arrest, the officer had stopped Hall on suspicion on speeding and Hall had invited him to his house for a drink. The officer later blamed his intoxicated state on Hall having laced his drink. Hall denied the accusation and was never charged.

===Child sexual abuse prosecution and conviction===
In May 2012, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, a journalist and regular columnist for &quot;The Independent&quot;, received an anonymous three-page letter alleging that Hall had groomed and sexually abused the sender while she was a schoolgirl in the 1970s. The writer stated that she had been motivated to disclose her experiences by the reports of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile after his death and by her anger at Hall&#x27;s appointment as an OBE in the 2012 New Year Honours. Alibhai-Brown passed the letter to the Metropolitan Police at Ealing police station, who in turn sent it on to Lancashire Constabulary, in whose jurisdiction the alleged offences had occurred. Lancashire Constabulary then began an investigation.

On 5 December 2012, police arrested Hall and charged him with three historical counts of indecent assault, involving a 16- or 17-year-old girl in 1974, a 9-year-old girl in 1983, and a 13-year-old girl in 1984. Released on bail, Hall initially denied any wrongdoing, issuing a statement through his solicitor that he was &quot;innocent of these charges&quot;. When he appeared at Preston Magistrates&#x27; Court on 7 January 2013, he pleaded not guilty to all three charges. The case was committed to Crown Court for trial. Hall was released on bail on condition that he remained resident at his home address and had no unsupervised contact with children under the age of 17. Media coverage of the case led to more women coming forward to state that Hall had also sexually abused them.

On 22 January 2013, Hall was charged with raping a 22-year-old woman in 1976 and indecently assaulting ten more girls, then aged from 9 to 17 years old, between 1967 and 1986. Speaking to reporters after an appearance at Preston Magistrates Court on 7 February 2013, Hall again denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges &quot;pernicious, callous, cruel and, above all, spurious&quot;.

However, at a pre-trial hearing at Preston Crown Court on 16 April 2013, Hall pleaded guilty to 14 charges of indecent assault involving 13 girls aged between 9 and 17 years old. He was released on bail pending sentencing on 17 June. Reporting restrictions prevented the media from making the news public until 2 May, when the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) elected not to pursue the rape charge or three other indecent assault charges relating to the same complainant, who had decided not to give evidence. Hall made a statement through his barrister issuing an &quot;unreserved apology&quot; to his victims.

On 15 July 2013, Lancashire Constabulary confirmed that five new allegations of rape and sexual assault had been made against Hall, including the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl. These investigations resulted in a further 16 charges of rape and indecent assault being laid against Hall in October 2013. On 6 November, he appeared in court in relation to the new charges, but did not make any plea. He made a further appearance in court on 29 November; at a preliminary court hearing on 28 February 2014, he pleaded not guilty to raping two young girls. He went on trial at Preston Crown Court on 6 May 2014, where he admitted indecently assaulting a girl under 16 but denied 20 further charges. On 16 May, Hall was found not guilty of 15 charges of rape and four counts of indecent assault but was found guilty on two counts of indecent assault against a 13-year-old girl.

===Sentencing===
At Preston Crown Court on 17 June 2013, Judge Anthony Russell QC sentenced Hall to 15 months in prison. Later the same day, the attorney general&#x27;s office announced that it had received complaints that the sentence was &quot;unduly lenient&quot;. The shadow attorney general and Labour MP Emily Thornberry stated that she believed Hall deserved a longer sentence given the age of his victims and the fact that he had publicly denied the offences at first. The attorney general subsequently referred the sentence to the Court of Appeal for review. On 26 July, Hall&#x27;s sentence was increased to 30 months. Following his additional conviction for indecent assault in May 2014, Mr Justice Turner sentenced Hall to a further two years and six months in prison, to run consecutively to his existing prison sentence of 30 months.

In a later ruling on the case of Max Clifford, the appeal court compared Clifford&#x27;s case with Hall&#x27;s; Clifford had claimed innocence, but did not directly impugn his victims. In contrast, Hall had publicly denounced his victims and accused one of seeking &quot;instant notoriety&quot;. A lawyer commented on the Clifford ruling: &quot;Nothing Clifford did resembled the disastrous approach taken by Stuart Hall who, prior to pleading guilty to abusing them as girls, denounced his accusers as gold-diggers and liars.&quot; Clifford&#x27;s actions were deemed merely to show no remorse, and not to justify an increased penalty on appeal, although ruling out a reduction in sentence due to mitigating factors; in contrast Hall&#x27;s sentence was increased on appeal.

===Civil action===
In July 2013, the media reported that 17 women were preparing to launch civil claims against Hall and the BBC, on whose premises a number of sexual assaults had allegedly taken place. Lawyers for the women confirmed that several of the claims related to alleged offences that were not part of Hall&#x27;s criminal prosecution.

Following Hall&#x27;s arrest for child sexual offences, Land Registry records revealed that on 22 February 2013, he had transferred his home, which he and his wife Hazel had owned jointly since 1981, into his wife&#x27;s sole name. Although Hall claimed that he was getting his financial affairs in order because of a heart condition that left him at risk of sudden death, lawyers acting for his victims said they would seek a court order to nullify the transfer of the property, worth an estimated £1.2 million, on the basis that he had relinquished ownership to avoid compensation claims.

===Release===
Hall was released from HM Prison Wymott near Preston, Lancashire, on 16 December 2015, having served half his sentence. He arrived home in time for Christmas and his birthday on the same day. In a February 2016 interview with &quot;The Sun&quot;, Hall criticised his accusers, &#x27;those who impugned&#x27; him, for bringing him down and says he hopes for &#x27;fairness&#x27;. A woman Hall attacked when she was a teenage girl said, &quot;To me he&#x27;ll always be the lowest of the low, a vile paedophile who&#x27;s ruined so many lives.&quot;

===BBC response===
When the news of Hall&#x27;s guilty plea became public, the BBC immediately terminated his contract and stated: &quot;The BBC is appalled by the disgraceful actions of Stuart Hall and we would like to express our sympathy to his victims.&quot; Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, initially announced that Dame Janet Smith would extend her inquiry into the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal to include Hall&#x27;s sex offences. The BBC subsequently decided to launch a separate inquiry headed by a different individual. As a result of Hall&#x27;s crimes, the BBC no longer uses clips featuring Hall and edits him out of archive footage when they are broadcast on television.

The &quot;Dame Janet Smith Review&quot;, released 25 February 2016, found that Hall had assaulted 21 female victims at the BBC, the youngest of whom was aged 10, between 1967 and 1991. The report found that some BBC staff members were aware he was bringing underage girls into his dressing room for sex, but his &quot;untouchable&quot; celebrity status stopped them from passing complaints to senior management.

==Personal life and honours==
Hall married Hazel Bennett on 1 March 1958 and lived in Wilmslow, Cheshire, until his 2013 conviction. The couple&#x27;s first son, Nicholas, died shortly after birth because of a heart defect. They went on to have a daughter and another son. Hall owns an extensive collection of clocks, including one that belonged to Napoleon Bonaparte. It was reported in February 2014 that Hazel was &quot;filing for divorce&quot; before Hall&#x27;s trial in May 2014 where he was accused, but eventually acquitted, of raping two teenage girls.

===Honours===
In 1999, various Members of Parliament signed a House of Commons Early Day Motion, congratulating Hall on 40 years in broadcasting. Hall was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting and charity, but the honour was formally annulled in October 2013 due to his conviction for sex offences.

<doc id="482383" wikidata="Q1122281" url="?curid=482383" title="The King of Comedy (film)">
<text>The King of Comedy is a 1982 American satirical black comedy film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro (in his fifth collaboration with Scorsese), Jerry Lewis and Sandra Bernhard. Written by Paul D. Zimmerman, the film focuses on themes such as celebrity worship and American media culture. 20th Century-Fox released the film on February 18, 1983, in the United States, though the film was released two months earlier in Iceland.

In the film, an aspiring stand-up comedian is increasingly obsessed with a successful comedian whom he met by chance.

Production began in New York on June 1, 1981, to avoid clashing with a forthcoming writers&#x27; strike, and opened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1983. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics but was a flop at the box office, grossing only $2.5 million against its $19 million budget. It is the first production of Embassy International Pictures, later Regency Enterprises.

== Plot ==
Rupert Pupkin is a mentally-deranged stand-up comedian unsuccessfully trying to launch his career. After meeting Jerry Langford, a successful comedian and talk show host, Rupert believes his &quot;big break&quot; has finally come. He attempts to book a spot on the show but is continually rebuffed by Langford&#x27;s staff and finally by Langford himself. Along the way, Rupert indulges in elaborate and obsessive fantasies in which he and Langford are colleagues and friends. Hoping to impress, Rupert invites a date, Rita, to accompany him when he decides to show up uninvited at Langford&#x27;s country home. When Langford returns to his house from a golfing round, he finds Rupert and Rita settling in. Angered, he launches into a furious tirade against Rupert, telling him that his act is mediocre and that he&#x27;s a lunatic who will never amount to anything. An embarrassed Rita eventually convinces Rupert to leave.

When the straight approach does not work, Rupert carries out a kidnapping plot with the help of Masha, a fellow stalker similarly obsessed with Langford. As ransom, Rupert demands that he be given the opening spot on that evening&#x27;s Jerry Langford Show, and that the show be broadcast as normal (with Tony Randall as guest host). The network brass and the FBI agree to his demands, with the understanding that Langford will be released once the show airs. Between the taping of the show and the broadcast, Masha has her &quot;dream date&quot; with Langford, who is duct-taped to a chair in her parents&#x27; Manhattan townhouse. Jerry convinces her to untie him and he manages to escape.

Rupert&#x27;s stand-up routine is well received by the audience. In his act, he describes his troubled life while simultaneously laughing at his circumstances. Rupert closes by confessing to the studio audience that he kidnapped Jerry Langford in order to break into showbusiness. The audience laughs, believing it to be part of his act. Rupert responds by saying, &quot;Tomorrow you&#x27;ll know I wasn&#x27;t kidding and you&#x27;ll all think I&#x27;m crazy. But I figure it this way: better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime.&quot;

News reports of Rupert&#x27;s phenomenal success at comedy and his prison sentence and release play over a montage of performances of his, then of storefronts stocking his &quot;long awaited&quot; autobiography, &quot;King For a Night&quot;. Reports state that Rupert still considers Jerry Langford his mentor and friend and that he and his agent are currently weighing several &quot;attractive offers&quot;, including comedy tours and a film adaptation of his memoirs. The final scene shows Rupert taking the stage for an apparent TV special with a live audience and an announcer enthusiastically introducing, lavishly praising, and giving him extended applause.

== Production ==
After &quot;Raging Bull&quot; was completed, Scorsese had thought about retiring from feature films to make documentaries instead because he felt &quot;unsatisfied&quot; and had not found his &quot;inner peace&quot; yet. However, he was keen to do a pet project of his, &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;, and wanted De Niro to play Jesus Christ. De Niro was not interested and preferred their next collaboration to be a comedy. He had purchased the rights to a script by film critic Paul D. Zimmerman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baxter pp.219/20&quot;&gt;Baxter, John &quot;De Niro A Biography&quot; pp. 219/20.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Cimino was announced as the director for &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; on March 7, 1979, but was replaced by Martin Scorsese on November 10, due to production being stalled by Cimino&#x27;s focus on the editing process of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;.

Bob Fosse briefly considered directing the film and suggested Andy Kaufman as Rupert Pupkin, Sandra Bernhard as Masha and Sammy Davis Jr. as Jerry Langford. In the original draft that Fosse read, the Langford character was to be a self-absorbed, hypocritical host of 24-hour TV telethons for charity much like Jerry Lewis&#x27;s own yearly telethons. Ultimately, Fosse passed on the film in favor of directing &quot;Star 80&quot; instead, and the Langford character was switched from a telethon host to a late-night talk show host. Scorsese pondered whether he could face shooting another film, particularly with a looming strike by the Writers Guild of America. Producer Arnon Milchan aimed to keep the project away from Hollywood interference by filming entirely on location in New York, and felt he could deliver it on time with the involvement of a smaller film company.

After a strong critical appreciation for the way in which he had shot &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, Scorsese felt that &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; needed a rawer cinematic style which would take its cues from early silent cinema, using more static camera shots and fewer dramatic close-ups. Scorsese has noted that Edwin S. Porter&#x27;s 1903 film &quot;Life of an American Fireman&quot; greatly influenced &quot;The King of Comedy&quot;&#x27;s visual style. Scorsese shot scenes multiple times, spending a fortnight reshooting to perfect one scene, resulting in a large amount of footage which had to be edited down.

De Niro prepared for the role of Rupert Pupkin by developing a &quot;role reversal&quot; technique, consisting of chasing down his own autograph-hunters, stalking them and asking them many questions. As Scorsese remembered, he even agreed to meet and talk with one of his longtime stalkers:The guy was waiting for him with his wife, a shy suburban woman who was rather embarrassed by the situation. He wanted to take him to dinner at their house, a two-hour drive from New York. After he had persuaded him to stay in Manhattan, [De Niro] asked him, &#x27;Why are you stalking me? What do you want?&#x27; He replied, &#x27;To have dinner with you, have a drink, chat. My mom asked me to say hi.&#x27;De Niro also spent months watching stand-up comedians at work to get the rhythm and timing of their performances right. Fully in phase with his character, he went as far as declining an invitation to dinner from Lewis because he was &quot;supposed to be at his throat and ready to kill him for [his] chance&quot;.

In the biography/overview of his work, &quot;Scorsese on Scorsese&quot;, the director had high praise for Jerry Lewis, stating that during their first conversation before shooting, Lewis was extremely professional and assured him before shooting that there would be no ego clashes or difficulties. Scorsese said he felt Lewis&#x27; performance in the film was vastly underrated and deserved more acclaim.
In an interview with &quot;People&quot; magazine, Lewis claimed that Scorsese and De Niro employed method acting tricks during the filming, such as using antisemitic epithets to &quot;pump up Lewis&#x27;s anger&quot;. Lewis described making the film as a pleasurable experience and noted that he got along well with both Scorsese and De Niro. Lewis said he was invited to collaborate on certain aspects of the script dealing with celebrity life. He suggested an ending in which Rupert Pupkin kills Jerry, but was turned down. As a result, Lewis thought that the film, while good, did not have a &quot;finish&quot;.

In an interview for the DVD, Scorsese stated that Lewis proposed the brief scene in which Langford, having acquiesced to an old lady&#x27;s request for an autograph, refuses to speak on the phone to her relative, prompting her to scream at him, &quot;You should only get cancer!&quot; The scene was based on a real incident from Lewis&#x27;s life, and he directed the actress playing the old lady to get the timing right.

=== Writing ===
At the time he wrote his script, Paul D. Zimmerman was inspired by a David Susskind show on autograph hunters and an &quot;Esquire&quot; article on a fanatical Johnny Carson follower. Scorsese first became aware of Zimmerman&#x27;s script after it was brought to him by Robert De Niro in 1974, but declined the project citing that he felt no personal connection with it. Michael Cimino was attached to direct but his involvement with the script fell through when he left the project to direct &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;. Prompted by the alienation he felt from his growing celebrity status, and De Niro&#x27;s insistence that the film could be made &quot;real fast&quot;, and that it would be a &quot;New York movie&quot; Scorsese&#x27;s interest in the project was rekindled.

=== Casting ===
Scorsese&#x27;s first choice for talk show host Jerry Langford was Johnny Carson. Carson refused the role, saying &quot;you know that one take is enough for me&quot;. Joey Bishop, Orson Welles and Dick Cavett were also considered. The entire Rat Pack was also considered—specifically Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin—before a decision was made to select Martin&#x27;s old partner, Jerry Lewis.

=== Principal photography ===
Arnon Milchan suggested shooting begin a month earlier than scheduled to avoid possible work stoppage from the DGA strike. Furthermore, Scorsese was not in good health. The film was shot beginning on June 1, 1981, and lasting over a twenty-week period, with Scorsese shooting from 4 pm to 7 pm every day.

=== Scorsese&#x27;s health ===
Scorsese had suffered from poor health both before and during the film&#x27;s production. He had previously worked on three films close together and not long after, found himself hospitalized due to exhaustion and pneumonia. He had not recovered when shooting began. The intensive filming schedule meant Scorsese could spend the remainder of his time recuperating.

=== Music ===
Robbie Robertson produced the music for the film&#x27;s soundtrack and contributed his first original work after leaving The Band entitled &quot;Between Trains&quot;. This song, a tribute to a member of the production staff who had suddenly died, is on the soundtrack album but not in the movie itself.
&quot;The King of Comedy&quot; soundtrack is a mix of popular music and thematic orchestral scoring by composer Bob James. The soundtrack includes songs from artists such as B.B. King, Van Morrison and Ray Charles. This kind of hybridization of pop and scored music would later be used in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, &quot;The Aviator&quot; and &quot;The Departed&quot;.

==== Soundtrack album ====
A soundtrack album was released on vinyl and cassette by Warner Bros. Records in 1983. The soundtrack was finally released on compact disc by Wounded Bird Records in 2016.

== Home media ==
&quot;The King of Comedy&quot; was released on Region 1 DVD on December 12, 2002, and on Region 2 on April 19, 2004.

A digital restoration of the movie was presented on April 27, 2013, as the closing film of De Niro&#x27;s Tribeca Film Festival. This latest version was produced from the film&#x27;s original camera negatives and features a restored soundtrack. While the restored film was scheduled to be released onto Blu-ray on October 29, 2013, the 30th Anniversary home media release was ultimately delayed for a release date of March 25, 2014.

== Stage musical ==
In 2015, it was announced a stage musical for Broadway was to be made with Stephen Trask writing the music and lyrics, and a book by Chris D&#x27;Arienzo.

== Reception and legacy ==
Although the film was well received by critics, it bombed at the box office. De Niro said that the film &quot;maybe wasn&#x27;t so well received because it gave off an aura of something that people didn&#x27;t want to look at or know&quot;. , 89% of critics have given the film a positive review on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 70 critic reviews, with an average rating of 8.30/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states, &quot;Largely misunderstood upon its release, &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; today looks eerily prescient, and features a fine performance by Robert De Niro as a strangely sympathetic psychopath.&quot; Metacritic gives it a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 based on 13 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;Time Out&quot; called it &quot;Creepiest movie of the year in every sense, and one of the best&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, writing, &quot;&quot;The King of Comedy&quot; is one of the most arid, painful, wounded movies I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s hard to believe Scorsese made it&quot;. He also wrote, &quot;Scorsese doesn&#x27;t want laughs in this movie, and he also doesn&#x27;t want release. The whole movie is about the inability of the characters to get any kind of a positive response to their bids for recognition.&quot; He concluded the film &quot;is not, you may already have guessed, a fun movie. It is also not a bad movie. It is frustrating to watch, unpleasant to remember, and, in its own way, quite effective.&quot; Fellow critic Gene Siskel recommended it on his list as part of their &quot;Buried Treasures&quot; in a 1986 episode of &quot;At the Movies&quot;.

Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; gave the film a favorable review, calling it &quot;clearly an extension of &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and the &quot;uncenteredness of the film is irritating, though it&#x27;s irritating in an ambitious, risk-taking way&quot;. Joyce Millman of &quot;Salon&quot; called it &quot;Martin Scorsese&#x27;s second-least popular movie, after &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;. Which is a shame, because it&#x27;s Scorsese&#x27;s second-greatest film, after &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;&quot;. However, not all critics gave the film positive reviews. Adam Smith of &quot;Empire&quot; called it &quot;Neither funny enough to be an effective black comedy nor scary enough to capitalise on its thriller/horror elements&quot;.

David Ehrenstein, author of &quot;The Scorsese Picture&quot;, noted the mixed response of the film in his 1983 review. He stated that &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; &quot;cuts too close to the bone for either large-scale mass audience approval or unanimous mainstream critical acclaim&quot;. He believed that the film presented a very critical portrayal of the Reagan administration in contrast to other films made during the administration&#x27;s early years (although the script was written well before Reagan&#x27;s election, and shooting began less than five months after Reagan took office). &quot;At a time when the film world piles on simple-minded sentiment in thick gooey gobs, a picture like &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; appears a frontal assault. The triumph of the &#x27;little guy&#x27; is revealed to be nothing more than lumpen neo-Fascist blood lust.&quot;

Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was one of the critics who disliked the film, describing the character of Rupert Pupkin as &quot;Jake LaMotta without fists&quot;. She went on to write that &quot;De Niro in disguise denies his characters a soul. De Niro&#x27;s &#x27;bravura&#x27; acting in &quot;Mean Streets, Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;New York, New York&quot; collapsed into &#x27;anti-acting&#x27; after he started turning himself into repugnant flesh effigies of soulless characters ... Pupkin is a nothing.&quot; Scorsese says that &quot;people were confused with &quot;King of Comedy&quot; and saw Bob as some sort of mannequin&quot;. Scorsese has called De Niro&#x27;s role as Rupert Pupkin his favorite of all their collaborations.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; as one of his favorite films. German director Wim Wenders numbered it among his 15 favorite films. In a 2010 retrospective, Mark Kermode ranked the film among Scorsese&#x27;s finest.

Sandra Bernhard, who plays Masha in the film, indicated in a 2013 interview that Jack Black was interested in a remake. However, she dismissed the idea, saying it was &quot;too late&quot; to do it. Actor Steve Carell and director Bennett Miller, both black comedy fans, cited &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; as a personal favorite and inspiration to shape the sociopath character of John E. du Pont in &quot;Foxcatcher&quot;. The screenplay for the 2019 film &quot;Joker&quot;, which also featured De Niro and written by director Todd Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver, is frequently cited by Phillips as drawing inspiration from both &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; and Scorsese&#x27;s 1976 film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;.

=== Debate about ending ===
The film provides no definitive answer as to whether the ending is reality or fantasy.

In his commentary on The Criterion Collection DVD of &quot;Black Narcissus&quot;, Scorsese stated that Michael Powell&#x27;s films influenced &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; in its conception of fantasy. Scorsese said that Powell always treated fantasy as no different from reality, and so made fantasy sequences as realistic as possible. Scorsese suggests that Rupert Pupkin&#x27;s character fails to differentiate between his fantasies and reality in much the same way. Scorsese sought to achieve the same with the film so that, in his words, the &quot;fantasy is more real than reality&quot;.

=== &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; connection ===
Rupert Pupkin has been compared to Travis Bickle in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;: both characters have serious issues with reality testing that is drawing the line between outer objective and inner subjective reality. In her review, entertainment columnist Marilyn Beck approved Johnny Carson&#x27;s refusal to participate in &quot;The King of Comedy&quot;, supposedly because he feared the film could inspire psychopaths like John Hinckley. Beck considered &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; even more dangerous than &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; due to its lack of blood and gore, as well as the fact that viewers could easily identify with De Niro. In a documentary featured in the first DVD release of the film, Scorsese himself acknowledged the connection between the two characters: &quot;&quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. Travis. Rupert. The isolated person. Is Rupert more violent than Travis? Maybe.&quot;

<text>Tissington is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Tissington and Lea Hall, in the Derbyshire Dales district of Derbyshire, England. In 2001 the parish had a population of 158. The population &quot;Tissington and Lea Hall&quot; at the 2011 census was 159. It is part of the estate of Tissington Hall, owned by the FitzHerbert family since 1465. It is a popular tourist attraction, particularly during its well dressing week. It also gives its name to the Tissington Trail, a walk and cycle path which passes nearby. The Limestone Way, another long-distance path and bridleway, passes through the village itself.

==History==
Tissington (Old English &quot;Tidsige&#x27;s farm/settlement&quot;) is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Tizinctun&quot;, having been given to Henry de Ferrers by the King:

&quot;In Tizinctun Ulchel, Edric, Ganel, Uluiet, Wictric, Leuric, Godwin had 4 of land for . Land for 4 ploughs. Now in the demesne there (are) 3 ploughs: and 12 , and 8 having 4 ploughs, and 1 mill of 3 shillings (value); and of meadow. Underwood in length and 4 furlongs in breadth. In the time of King Edward it was worth £4, now 40 shillings&quot;

During the reign of Henry I the estate passed to the Savage family. After the death of the last male heir, William le Savage in 1259 it was split between the families of the joint heiresses, the Meynells and Edensors. The Meynell&#x27;s part of the estate was acquired in marriage by Nicholas FitzHerbert in the 1460s. During the reign of Elizabeth I, Francis, the great-grandson of Nicholas, purchased the remainder from the heirs of Edensors. From then the village and estate has been wholly in the ownership of the FitzHerbert family.

During the Civil War a redoubt or siegework was constructed on the hill north of the church. The buried and earthwork remains are protected as a Scheduled Monument. Tissington Hall was garrisoned for the King by its owner, Colonel Fitzherbert
in December 1643.

As of March 2021, and since 1989, the owner of the village was Sir Richard FitzHerbert, 9th Baronet who resides at Tissington Hall. In an interview, he said that 45 of the properties were rented out and that tenants farmed the 2,000 acres around the Hall which operates some corporate events and weddings.

On 1 April 2009 the parish was abolished and merged with Lea Hall to form &quot;Tissington &amp; Lea Hall&quot;.

==Notable buildings==

In the centre of the village is Tissington Hall, the seat of the FitzHerberts. A Jacobean building built in 1609 by Francis FitzHerbert, replacing an earlier moated manor house, it is a Grade II* listed building. The owner was awarded the Bledisloe Gold Medal &quot;for estate management by the Royal Agricultural Society&quot; in 2006.

The parish church of St Mary opposite the hall has a Norman tower and font. The font is thought to depict a scene from the legend of Saint Beorhthelm of Stafford.

The majority of the other buildings in the village are built in the local vernacular style, of which around 70% are listed buildings.

==Well dressings==
An estimated 50,000 people visit the village to view its well dressings each year. Six wells (Children&#x27;s Well, Coffin Well, Hall Well, Hands Well, Town Well and Yew Tree Well) are decorated during the week of Ascension Sunday with pictures formed by pressing flower petals and other organic materials into a clay substrate. The pictures are usually on a Biblical theme reflecting current events or anniversaries. This tradition is often cited to date back at least to 1348, following the village’s escape from the Black Death, which the villagers attributed to the purity of the water in its wells.

==Literary connections==
Richard Graves wrote some of his novel &quot;The Spiritual Quixote&quot; whilst staying in Tissington.

<doc id="482388" wikidata="Q3121417" url="?curid=482388" title="Doctor of Psychology">
<text>The Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D. or D.Psych.) is a professional doctoral degree intended to prepare graduates for careers that apply scientific knowledge of psychology and deliver empirically based service to individuals, groups and organizations. Earning the degree was originally completed through one of two established training models for clinical psychology. However, Psy.D. programs are no longer limited to Clinical Psychology as several universities and professional schools have begun to award professional doctorates in Business Psychology, Organizational Development, Forensic Psychology, Counseling Psychology, and School Psychology.

==Background==

The initial guidelines for the education and training of clinical psychologists were established in 1949 at an American Psychological Association (APA)-sponsored Conference on Training in Clinical Psychology in Boulder, Colorado. Students would be prepared both to conduct experimental research and apply knowledge for clinical practice. This approach became known as the scientist–practitioner model, although it is often referred to as the Boulder model since the conference was held in Boulder, Colorado.

The difficulty integrating the education and training for both research and practice within the same degree has been long recognized. While the scientist-practitioner model ostensibly included clinical training, many argued that preparation for practice was often neglected. Some also argued that in trying to train students in both research and practice, not enough emphasis was placed on either. In regard to research, the mode (most common) number of publications by graduates of PhD. programs was zero. In regard to practice, students were not being trained effectively for the needs of people seeking services.

While the scientist-practitioner model “stood intransigent and impervious through the 1950s and 60s”, the APA attempted to respond to pressure for more and better clinical training by forming the Committee on the Scientific and Professional Aims of Psychology in 1963. The Committee concluded that the scientist-practitioner model failed to do either of the jobs for which it was designed and recommended several important changes, including: establishing separate practice-oriented programs, potentially in locations other than university psychology departments; developing a practice-oriented training model; and using the Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D) degree to designate preparation for clinical practice. The Committee&#x27;s conclusions and recommendations met with controversy. In particular, opponents said a different degree would impact the field&#x27;s prestige and ignore science. Proponents, however, argued it would be informed by science and that other practice-oriented healthcare disciplines, such as medicine, had well-respected professional degrees.

In 1973, the APA sponsored the Conference on Levels and Patterns of Training in Vail, Colorado. Conference members concluded that psychological knowledge had matured sufficiently to warrant creating distinct practice-oriented programs. Members also concluded that if the education and training for practice differs from research, then different degrees should reflect that: when emphasis is on preparing students for providing clinical services, the Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D) degree should be awarded; when the focus is on preparing students for conducting experimental research, the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree should be awarded. This approach became known as the practitioner-scholar model, also known as the Vail model. Graduates of both training models would be eligible for licensure in all jurisdictions in the United States, and the licensing exams and renewal requirements would be the same for both degrees.

With the creation of the Doctor of Psychology degree, the APA confirmed that the Psy.D. is a credential that certifies attainment of the knowledge and skill required to establish clinical psychology as a profession. Furthermore, it follows the policies of both the Association of American Universities, and the Council of Graduate Schools: a professional doctorate (e.g., D.D.S., D.V.M., J.D., and M.D.) is awarded in recognition of preparation for professional practice, whereas the PhD. is awarded in recognition of preparation for research.

==Education and clinical training==
The practice of clinical psychology is based on an understanding of the scientific method and behavioral science. The focus of the Doctor of Psychology training model is on the application of this knowledge for direct clinical intervention. This includes the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness, as well as cognitive and emotional impairments in which psychological approaches may be of use. Compared to P.hD., the Psy.D. places less of an emphasis on research. Students from Psy.D. programs receive about the same number of clinical training hours as students from Ph.D. programs prior to internship. 

Doctor of Psychology programs take four to seven years to complete, and are typically slightly shorter than Ph.D. programs (due to the lesser focus on research training and approximately equivalent clinical training requirements). Students in these programs receive a broad and general education in scientific psychology and evidence-based treatment. Coursework includes: Biological bases of behavior; cognitive-affective bases of behavior; social-cultural bases of behavior; lifespan development; assessment and diagnosis; treatment and intervention; research methods and statistics; and ethical and professional standards. Specialized training (e.g., neuropsychology, forensic psychology, psychodynamic psychology) is also available in some programs.

Students in doctoral psychology programs receive extensive clinical training through placements in various settings (e.g., community mental health centers, hospitals, juvenile hall, college counseling centers). These placements provide direct patient contact that is supervised by a licensed psychologist. Clinical training culminates in a 1,750–2,000 hour (1-year full-time or 2-year half-time) supervised internship.

In order to complete the Psy.D. degree, students typically must demonstrate several competencies: 1) knowledge mastery through passing comprehensive exams, and 2) clinical skill through successful completion of a pre-doctoral internship, and 3) scholarship through a doctoral research project.

Regional accreditation is available to doctoral programs in clinical psychology.

The doctoral degree allows for a broader range of career options in schools, private or independent practice, clinics, hospitals, or research/academia. Individuals with doctoral degrees may experience greater eligibility for various credentials.

As stated above, there are three different doctoral degrees for school psychology--Ph.D., Psy.D., and Ed.D. Career options for those with a Ph.D. may include being a school psychologist with a license at any level (preschool, primary, secondary or after), a professor for school psychology graduate students and/or screening for possible recruits for a school psychology program or a postdoctoral resident. Overall, those with a Ph.D. have more opportunities for leadership positions. Those with this degree can work in settings other than schools. Those with a Ph.D. are more likely to create student development workgroups and review proposals for conventions. They have been known to become editors for Best Practices, work with the editors in chief of journals, members of the NASP Communique Editorial Board, reviewers for the National School Psychology Certification Board and part of NASP&#x27;s Social Justice Committee. Some school psychologists choose to continue practicing in a K-12 setting but encourage more trained school staff for professional development i.e for functional behavioral assessments and behavior intervention plans. Those who have obtained a PhD. have a greater opportunity to conduct comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations for educational and forensic purposes, review medical/legal records for forensic evaluations, and see clients for therapy. These individuals may even develop new rating scales to the field. Those with this degree have the opportunity to be recognized as a member of the American Psychological Association.

Career options for those who attain an Ed.D. may include becoming a university professor, creating school policy, focusing on administration, educational technology and district-wide leadership, and assisting in adult education, curriculum and instruction. Overall these areas can be broken up into three subgroups; research and academia, management and influence. If the individual chose to be involved in research and academia they could teach at public/private universities and conduct/publish research. The knowledge and experience gained through the doctorate program is imperative in having a successful career in academia. A doctorate is not required for management in some school districts; however, the degree, experience, and education can help in competitive positions. All of the experience and knowledge acquired helps with understanding education from a different perspective.

For those training in school psychology programs, Psy.D. training usually takes four to six years to complete and is, like in clinical and counseling programs, generally slightly shorter than Ph.D. training. Once the Psy.D. is earned, the school psychologist becomes eligible for licensure as a psychologist from an APA approved program. Psy.D. career options may include private practice, working in university based settings (undergraduate teaching or other practitioner scholar Psy.D programs), working in community based mental health centers (behavioral health, disorders, i.e.), working in outpatient settings- clinics for individual or group therapy, or working for juvenile justice programs (work with incarcerated youth). 
It is recommended to work in the field before pursuing a school psychology doctoral degree.

Doctoral training programs may be approved by NASP and/or accredited by the American Psychological Association. In 2007, approximately 125 programs were approved by NASP, and 58 programs were accredited by APA. Another 11 APA-accredited programs were combined (clinical/counseling/school, clinical/school, or counseling/school) programs.

==Licensing==
A license to practice as a clinical psychologist is required in the United States as well as all over the globe. While specific requirements vary by jurisdiction, every state mandates: 1. Successful completion of either a 1-year full-time or 2-year half-time supervised clinical internship totaling 1,750–2,000 hours; and 2. Passing the national and state licensing exams. Most states require an additional postdoctoral year of supervised training after earning the doctorate, in order to become eligible to take the national and state licensing exams.

Maryland and Washington have removed the one year postdoctoral experience in place of requiring two years of supervised experience, both of which can be completed prior to graduation. In February 2006, the American Psychological Association Council of Representatives adopted a statement recommending that this change also be made to the licensing requirements of other states since the nature of training has changed dramatically in the last 50 years. Previously, doctoral-level students accrued most of their clinical hours during internship and postdoctoral fellowships. Now, students accrue most of their clinical hours in the course of their training and internship. Thus, they are ready to begin practice upon graduation. Next, there are considerably fewer positions available for recent graduates and providing the training before graduation facilitates early career psychologists.

==Licensing Exam [EPPP]==

In the United States, a doctoral degree from a program acceptable to the licensing board is required, including the PhD., Psy.D., and Ed.D. are among the doctorate degrees that make individuals eligible to sit for the Examination for Professional Practice of Psychology (EPPP; CA Board of Psychology). The EPPP is the national licensing examination and its completion is required in order for one to obtain a license to practice psychology.

While there is an increasing number of university-based Psy.D. programs, many Psy.D. programs are at newer professional schools of psychology.

<text>Dieburg () is a small town in southern Hesse, Germany. It was formerly the seat of the district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) of Dieburg, but is now part of the district of Darmstadt-Dieburg.

==History==
Early mentions of Dieburg date back to the early 13th century, with various spellings of its name attested. The city&#x27;s name is derived from the Middle High German words , meaning &quot;people&quot;, and , meaning &quot;castle&quot;. Therefore, Dieburg refers to the castle of the people, located in the centre of the medieval town. The town&#x27;s centre largely consists of historical timber-framed houses from medieval times. The Dieburg Museum, located in the Fechenbach stately home, displays archeological findings. Of special interest is a Roman temple relief of Mithras and a dyer&#x27;s workshop. The coat of arms of the town Dieburg shows Martin of Tours. A cultural highlight is the yearly carnival, including a carnival parade that is completely based on honorary posts.

==Geography==
Dieburg is situated north of mountain range Odenwald in southern Hesse. The Gersprenz (47 km), tributary to the Main, flows through Dieburg. The city of Darmstadt is located 15 kilometres to the West, the city of Frankfurt on the Main is located around 40 kilometres to the North of Dieburg.

<doc id="482397" wikidata="Q4862464" url="?curid=482397" title="Baron Henley">
<text>Baron Henley is a title that has been created twice: first in the Peerage of Great Britain and then in the Peerage of Ireland. The first creation came in 1760 in favour of Sir Robert Henley, Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, when he was created Lord Henley, Baron of Grainge, in the County of Southampton. In 1764 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Northington. On the death of his son, the second Earl, both titles became extinct. Lady Elizabeth Henley, youngest daughter of the first Earl and co-heiress of the second Earl, married the diplomat Morton Eden. In 1799, the Henley title was revived when Eden was created Baron Henley, of Chardstock in the County of Dorset, in the Peerage of Ireland. Their son, the second Baron, assumed the surname of Henley in lieu of Eden and notably published a biography of his maternal grandfather. His son, the third Baron, sat as Liberal Member of Parliament for Northampton. In 1885 the Northington title was also revived when he was created Baron Northington, of Watford in the County of Northampton, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave the Barons an automatic seat in the House of Lords. The fourth baron Frederick Henley was an educated man who served as JP in Northamptonshire and married Augusta, daughter of Herbert Langham 12th baronet.

His younger son, the sixth Baron, resumed the surname of Eden in 1925, the same year he succeeded his half-brother in the titles. the peerages are held by his grandson, the eighth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1977. He is a Conservative politician and served in the Conservative administrations of Margaret Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron. Lord Henley is now one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999.

The Barons Henley are members of the prominent Eden family. The first Baron was the fifth son of Sir Robert Eden, 3rd Baronet, of West Auckland, and the younger brother of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland. Their elder brother Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland (second son of the third Baronet of West Auckland), was the great-great-grandfather of Prime Minister Anthony Eden, 1st Earl of Avon, and the great-great-great-grandfather of the Conservative politician John Benedict Eden, Baron Eden of Winton.

The family seat is Scaleby Castle, near Carlisle, Cumbria.

<text>Ghana Airways Limited was the flag carrier of Ghana, with its main base of operation and hub at Kotoka International Airport in Accra. The airline ceased operations in 2004, although plans were discussed to revive it in 2020 in partnership with Egyptair.

==History==
===Formative years===

Ghana Airways was founded on 4 July 1958 by the government of Ghana with a start-up capital of £400,000, with the government holding a 60 percent stake and BOAC holding the remainder. When the company was founded, a seven-year agreement between the airline and BOAC was signed, which saw BOAC personnel being seconded to Accra, and Ghanaian personnel being trained in order for them to take over management and operation of the airline. Prior to the foundation of the company, BOAC and West African Airways Corporation were responsible for international services from Ghana, operating pool services from West Africa to London. For their initial operations, Ghana Airways joined the pool services, when BOAC began operating the Accra–London route on 16 July 1958 with a Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, with the aircraft being operated with the Ghanaian flag and in a livery minimally adapted from that of the UK carrier. The airline&#x27;s relationship with West African Airways ceased on 30 September, and on 1 October they began operating the domestic and regional flights formerly offered by WAAC. The airline&#x27;s first aircraft, and hence the first aircraft to be registered in Ghana since the nation became independent, was a de Havilland Heron delivered on 30 December. At the end of the airline&#x27;s first year of operation they had made a net profit of US$28,000.

A second Heron was delivered to the airline in 1959, and on 9 March, the first Douglas DC-3 entered service. Flights to London employed Bristol Britannia 102s wet-leased from BOAC from 16 April, leading to a reduction in Stratocruiser services and the retirement of the type after its final departure for London, via Barcelona, on 31 August. (BOAC&#x27;s own Stratocruiser services on the route had ceased on 31 May.) By the end of 1959, an order for two Britannias was placed and a service to Conakry was introduced. In 1960, three Vickers Viscounts were ordered on 20 April. Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah was accused of being too aligned to the West, and hence he entered into agreements with the Soviets and on 18 August, six Ilyushin Il-18s, at a cost of £670,000 each, were ordered. After having initially expected to be delivered on 20 November, the first two of six Il-18s was delivered to Accra on 3 December and were initially crewed and maintained by Soviet personnel while Ghanaian personnel were trained. The aircraft entered service on routes from Accra to Lagos and Dakar, to Addis Ababa via Kano, and Nairobi via Léopoldville. Net profits for the year 1960 totaled US$462,000. In November 1960, the USSR also delivered a single Antonov An-12 to Ghana Airways.

The airline placed an order with Boeing in January 1961 for two Rolls-Royce Conway-powered Boeing 707-420s, and an order was also placed for three Vickers VC10s. The order for the two Boeings, valued at US$17,500,000, saw the airline planning flights to the United States from July 1962, with additional plans to begin flights to Tokyo and Sydney. A weekly Britannia service to Beirut, via Kano and Cairo, was inaugurated on 4 February 1961, making Ghana Airways the first West African airline to serve the Lebanese capital.

It was reported in January 1961 that the Nkrumah administration desired minimal foreign influence in Ghanaian affairs and saw Ghana Airways as a prime symbol of Ghana&#x27;s statehood. On 14 February 1961, the Ghanaian government reached an agreement with BOAC to buy the latter out of their 40% share in the airline for a reported £160,000. The check was presented to Sir Duncan Cumming on 15 February, who at the same time signed a contract renewing the management assistance contract, which dated back to July 1958. On delivery of the second Britannia, in December 1960, the new turboprops took over service from the wet-leased BOAC aircraft on the airline&#x27;s route to London. In June 1961, Ghana Airways commenced the first-ever non-stop Accra-London air connection, also using Britannias, and in July the government announced that the airline would be reorganized. The order for two Boeing 707s, which had been placed in January 1961, was cancelled in August due to difficulties in financing the purchase; in 1961 the airline lost US$800,000. The airline took delivery of the three Viscounts and an additional two Il-18s in 1962, for a total of eight Ilyushins. A weekly flight from Accra to Kumasi, Tamale, Ouagadougou, Mopti, Ségou and Bamako was inaugurated on 4 July 1962 utilising a Douglas DC-3. The pool arrangement with BOAC was terminated in November 1962, three years before its expected July 1965 expiry, after Ghana Airways signed a pool agreement with Alitalia covering flights between Accra and Rome. BOAC saw this arrangement with the Italian airline to be in competition with their agreement with the Ghanaian airline, under which Ghana Airways would be required to sell tickets for both airlines on the Accra-London route, which in the case of the Alitalia would be operated via Rome. By January 1963 the relationship with BOAC was almost nonexistent, as British United Airways took over general sales agent duties for the airline in the United Kingdom and Cunard Eagle was responsible for major maintenance on the airlines&#x27; aircraft. However, BOAC continued to provide passenger ground handling services for the airline at Heathrow Airport. By this time, the airline was operating domestic flights from Accra to Kumasi, Takoradi and Tamale, with regional flights being operated to Abidjan, Bamako, Bathurst, Conakry, Dakar, Freetown, Lagos and Monrovia. The airlines&#x27; international route network saw the airline flying to Addis Ababa, Beirut, Cairo, Khartoum, London, Rabat, Rome and Zürich.

Flights to Asmara were added in early 1963, and the flights with Il-18s continued to Aden in the Aden Protectorate, while in March the airline began flights to Switzerland and Moscow, although those flights were short-lived. In September 1963, the airline joined the International Air Transport Association, becoming its ninety-third member, and they returned four of their eight Il-18s to the Soviet Union after determining that they were surplus to the airline&#x27;s requirements. In 1961, it was reported that in three months of operation on the Accra-Khartoum route, the airline had carried only 12 revenue passengers. It was also reported in 1962 that the airline was only utilising the aircraft collectively for no more than 36 hours of flight time per week. The airline signed a lease agreement with Swissair in October 1963 for the wet-lease operation of Convair 990 jetliners on the Accra-London route.

The Viscounts were put up for sale in November 1964, and the airline began a pool agreement with Nigeria Airways, which saw Ghana Airways being given cabotage rights from Lagos to Cairo and Beirut via Kano and Addis Ababa. Midway through February 1965, the contract with Swissair came to an end, and the Vickers VC10 took its place. In the same month, the Britannias were withdrawn. The first VC10 was delivered to Accra on 18 December 1964 and initially conducted proving and training flights, before entering service on 15 February 1965 on the route to London. The second VC10 was delivered to the airline in June 1965, enabling services to Beirut to commence. Ghana Airways operated the aircraft in a configuration of 20 first class and 87 economy class seats.

Following the February 1966 coup in which Nkrumah&#x27;s regime was overthrown, the new National Liberation Council (NLC) took steps to eliminate loss-making routes from the Ghana Airways network, which Nkrumah had kept open in order to show the Ghanaian flag. However, the NLC continued Nkrumah&#x27;s policy of directing Ghana Airways to operate routes based upon politics but forced the airline to stop operations to Cairo because of the support for Nkrumah given by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.

The remaining Soviet aircraft, one Antonov An-12 and four Il-18s, were retired in 1967. The route to Bamako, suspended since the February 1966 coup, restarted in conjunction with Air Mali operating one of their Il-18s on the route. The airline also started a pool agreement with Nigeria Airways, under which Ghana Airways utilized Nigerian Fokker F27s on domestic routes and Nigeria Airways employed Ghana Airways Viscounts on their Lagos-Accra route.

The first McDonnell Douglas DC-9s were delivered in 1975, and in 1976 the airline added Lagos as a stopover on their route from Accra to Cotonou. The same year the airline placed an order for a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and whilst awaiting delivery took a DC-10 on lease from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The airline&#x27;s DC-10 was delivered on 24 February 1983, and the aircraft leased from the Dutch airline was returned. At this time the airline had added new international destinations to their route network, which included Amsterdam, Douala, Frankfurt, Jeddah, Libreville, and Niamey. The airline&#x27;s DC-10 also visited the West Indies on behalf of Caribbean Airways, thanks to a wet-lease contract, renewed in January 1986, which saw the aircraft operating twice-weekly services to Barbados from London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport in between its regular Accra-London rotations.

Flights to the United States began in September 1994, when the airline began operations to JFK International Airport in New York City with DC-10s leased from Skyjet on a twice-weekly basis. At this time, Düsseldorf and Harare were also featured on the airline&#x27;s route network. For its flights to New York City, the airline would later lease a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 from World Airways. In 1995, Speedwing, the consultancy arm of British Airways, was awarded a two-year contract to manage the airline. Following Ghana&#x27;s receipt of Category One status from the US Federal Aviation Administration, Ghana Airways was able to operate flights to New York City from mid-October 1996 utilising Ghanaian-registered DC-10s.

===Towards its demise===
The airline inked a co-operation agreement with South African Airways on 25 March 1999, which would see the two airlines increasing flights to near daily between Johannesburg and Accra, in addition to offering more services between West and East Africa to the United States. As part of the alliance, South African Airways ceased flights to Dakar in order to route their flights to the United States via Accra. Flights to Baltimore commenced in July 2000, with the Maryland city becoming the second United States destination for the airline. Flights to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates were inaugurated in November 2000, along with the re-introduction of flights to Beirut, after a thirty-year hiatus. Banjul in The Gambia was added to the route network in February 2001 in conjunction with Gambia International Airlines, with flights continuing to Baltimore, marking the first direct service between The Gambia and the United States. Operations to Banjul did not always operate smoothly. In January 2002 a group of disgruntled passengers due to travel to Baltimore threatened to burn the airlines&#x27; DC-10 and offices at Banjul International Airport after being stranded by the airline. The passengers were informed by employees of the airline that their 13 January flight was scheduled to arrive in Banjul at 10:00 am, however, upon arrival at the airport they were informed that their aircraft had arrived at 3:00 am and had already left for the United States. According to the passengers, Ghana Airways had flown a full aircraft into Banjul and had left for Baltimore. An official at the airport confirmed that a similar incident occurred on 6 January, after 40 passengers were stranded by the airline after the flight arrived in Banjul ahead of schedule.

One of the airlines&#x27; DC-10s was seized at Heathrow Airport in June 2002, after a British creditor of the airline got a legal judgement in order to recoup some £4 million in unpaid debts. After the seizure, Sam Jonah, then-airline chairman, stated that Ghana Airways was some US$160 million in debt, and the airline would require a foreign partner if it were to survive. He also noted that the British creditor released the aircraft after the airline paid US$1 million. The Ghanaian government announced in September 2002 that it had signed a deal with Nationwide Airlines which would see the South African airline taking over the management of the airline, which would have been renamed Ghana Nationwide International Airlines. Nationwide, which beat out rival British Midland, as part of the deal would not take on liabilities for the debts of the national airline. In February 2003, Richard Anane, the Minister of Roads and Transport, announced that the government had withdrawn from the deal with Nationwide Airlines.

It was announced in June 2003 that British Midland had entered into an agreement with the Ghanaian government for the creation of Fly Ghana Limited. The company, of which the government would hold a golden share, would operate for an indeterminate period as a separate entity to Ghana Airways, at which time both companies would be merged into a single company to potentially be named &quot;New Ghana Airways&quot;. Under the plan, British Midland would supply to the airline an Airbus A330 for use on flights to London, with an additional A330 being utilised on flights to New York City. Additionally, British Midland would operate a Fokker 100 on the airline&#x27;s regional route network, with the DC-10 being deployed on the airline&#x27;s secondary international routes.

In July 2004, the United States Department of Transportation banned the airline from operating flights into or out of the United States, whilst investigations were underway that the airline had ignored orders relating to the grounding of unsafe aircraft, and that the airline had been operating on an out-of-date licence. As a result, the airline was forced to cancel two weekly flights to JFK International Airport and two weekly flights to Baltimore–Washington International Airport. According to the spokesman of the USDOT, the airline had utilised an aircraft which the Federal Aviation Administration had ordered to be grounded on flights to New York City and Baltimore on 24 and 26 July, respectively. The banning led to the Ghana Airways board being sacked by the government, and the government taking over full control of the airline. Kwadwo Mpiani, the Presidential Chief of Staff, stated that the measures were necessary in order to prevent further damage coming to the national airline. He also stated that the government would insure that the airline would be turned around. The comments followed on from an incident the week previous when angry passengers took a Ghana Airways pilot hostage at Kokota International Airport, after they had waited for some days for their flights on the airline. In the aftermath of the incident, President John Kufuor held emergency meetings with officials from the airline and police.

It was reported in April 2005 that Ethiopian Airlines was negotiating with the government in Accra to help keep Ghana Airways afloat, in a deal which would have seen the government keeping a 25% share in the airline, with 40% being sold off to the Ethiopian national airline and Ghana International Airlines. Unable to keep up with its debt repayments, and due to the government refusal to pump more money into the airline, Ghana Airways was liquidated in June 2005.

In December 2008, the government released some $2.25 million to the liquidator to pay the final instalment in severance claims to ex-employees of Ghana Airways. This tranche brought the total amount paid out to Ghanaian employees of the airline to some $7.8 million. The Nigerian National Union of Air Transport Employees decried the payouts, claiming that Nigerian employees of the airline had only received 14% of their entitlements, whilst Ghanaian employees received their full entitlements. The Union also claimed that funds from the Lagos office of the airline were used to fund the office of the Ghanaian High Commission in Abuja.

=== Restart ===
In 2020, the Government of Ghana announced an MoU with EgyptAir to restart Ghana Airways. The airline will rehire former Ghana Airways staff and take delivery of 3 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Dr. Charles Wereko-Brobbey was appointed as the chairman of the new airline, while technical support will be provided by Egyptair and Boeing.

<text>RAF Ferry Command was the secretive Royal Air Force command formed on 20 July 1941 to ferry urgently needed aircraft from their place of manufacture in the United States and Canada, to the front line operational units in Britain, Europe, North Africa and the Middle East during the Second World War.

It was later subsumed into the new Transport Command on 25 March 1943 by being reduced to Group status.

==History==

The practice of ferrying aircraft from US manufacturers to the UK was begun by the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Its minister, Lord Beaverbrook, a Canadian by origin, reached an agreement with Sir Edward Beatty, a friend and chairman of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, to provide ground facilities and support. MAP would discreetly provide civilian crews and management. Previously, aircraft had been assembled, dismantled and then transported by ship across the Atlantic, and were subject to long delays and frequent attacks by German U-Boats.

Former RAF officer Don Bennett, a specialist in long distance flying and later Air Vice Marshal and commander of the Pathfinder force, led the first test delivery formation flight in November 1940. The mission was so successful that by 1941, MAP took the operation out of the hands of CPR to put it under the Atlantic Ferry Organization (&quot;Atfero&quot;) which was set up by Morris W. Wilson, a banker in Montreal. Wilson hired civilian pilots of widely different backgrounds and nationalities to fly the aircraft to the UK. Because the planes were now being flown on their own, each aircraft required specially trained navigators and radio operators. These crews were then brought back by ships in convoys. &quot;Atfero hired the pilots, planned the routes, selected the airports [and] set up weather and radiocommunication stations.&quot;

Aircraft were first transported to Dorval Airport near Montreal, and then flown to RCAF Station Gander in Newfoundland for the trans-Atlantic flight. The organization was passed to Air Ministry administration, though retaining civilian pilots, some of whom were Americans, alongside RAF and RCAF pilots, navigators and radio operators. The crews were briefed by local meteorologists including R. E. Munn. After completing delivery, crews were eventually flown back to Canada, returning to Dorval for their next run.

Ferry Command was formed on 20 July 1941, by the raising of the RAF Atlantic Ferry Service to Command status. Its commander for its whole existence was Air Chief Marshal Sir Frederick Bowhill. Dorval, near Montreal, continued as its base of operations.

The main function of Ferry Command was the ferrying of new aircraft from factory to operational unit. Ferry Command originally did this over only one northern area of the world, rather than the more general routes that Transport Command later developed, including routes over the jungles of South America and Africa and the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East. Ferry Command&#x27;s operational area was initially the North Atlantic, and its responsibility was to bring the larger aircraft that had the range to do the trip over the ocean, with the addition of extra fuel tanks, from American and Canadian factories to the RAF home commands.

This was pioneering work. Before Ferry Command, only about a hundred aircraft had attempted a North Atlantic crossing in good weather, and only about half had made it. Over the course of the war, more than 9,000 aircraft were individually ferried across the ocean and the aircraft played a significant role in the outcome of the war. This was accomplished without the use of radar by specially trained navigators who primarily used celestial methods.

=== Reduction in status to No. 45 Group ===
Ferry Command was subsumed into the new Transport Command on 25 March 1943 by being reduced to Group status as No 45 (Atlantic Ferry) Group. No. 45 Group RAF&#x27;s main task was the ferrying of U.S. and Canadian built aircraft across the Atlantic. It also administered trans-Atlantic passenger and freight services. The group still retained responsibility for Atlantic aircraft ferrying operations, but Transport Command was a worldwide formation, rather than a single-mission command. Bowhill became the first commander of Transport Command.

On 8 September 1944, No. 231 Squadron RAF reformed at Dorval, Canada, from No. 45 Group Communications Squadron. The squadron&#x27;s Coronado flying boats operated between North America, West Africa and the UK, using Largs on the Firth of Clyde as its British terminal. Other flights were flown with landplanes, using several of the types available to No. 45 Group as required. In September 1945 the squadron moved to Bermuda, where it disbanded on 15 January 1946.

In summer 1945, 45 Group included No. 112 (North Atlantic) Wing at Dorval, with 231 Squadron, 5 Aircraft Preparation Unit, 6 Ferry Unit all at Dorval; 6 APU at Bermuda; 313 Ferry Training Unit at North Bay; and RAF Station Reykjavik with the RAF Hospital there and No. 9 Mechanical Transport Company.

By the end of the war, crossing the Atlantic had become an almost routine operation, presaging the inauguration of scheduled commercial air transport services after the war.

==In media==
&quot;Above and Beyond&quot; (2006), a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) four-hour mini-series, was inspired by the true story of RAF Ferry Command, recounting the delivery of aircraft across the North Atlantic to the Royal Air Force. The film concludes with the departure of Don Bennett and the handover of control to RAF Command. The Lockheed Hudson is the primary aircraft portrayed in the mini-series, in the form of a real-life example alongside numerous CGI Hudsons.

<doc id="482408" wikidata="Q3401855" url="?curid=482408" title="Ici Radio-Canada Première">
<text>Ici Radio-Canada Première (formerly Première Chaîne) is a Canadian French-language radio network, the news and information service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (known as Société Radio-Canada in French), the public broadcaster of Canada. It is the French counterpart of CBC Radio One, the CBC&#x27;s similar English-language radio network.

The service is available across Canada, although not as widely as CBC Radio One. Only the provinces of Quebec and Ontario are served by more than one &quot;Première&quot; originating station. In all other provinces, the whole province is served by a single station with multiple transmitters. It reaches 90 percent of all Canadian francophones.

Each originating station outside Montreal airs a national schedule, taken from flagship station CBF-FM, complete with opted-out local/regional shows at peak times, depending on each market. News bulletins are aired live, irrespective of location.

The network may broadcast on either the AM or FM bands, depending on the market. A national version is available across North America on Sirius XM Canada channel 170. Première was available in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East live via the Hot Bird satellite. The satellite service closed in June 2012 as part of the budget measures affecting Radio Canada International.

==History==

Some French-language programming had aired on the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission&#x27;s CRCM since 1933, but the CBC&#x27;s French radio network traces its formal beginning to December 11, 1937, with the launch of CBF in Montreal.

In 1938, the station was expanded into a fledgling network with the launch of CBV in Quebec City and CBJ in Chicoutimi. Also that year, the long-running soap opera &quot;La Pension Velder&quot;, which ran until 1942 and was then revived in the 1950s as a television series, aired for the first time. The following year, the even more successful and influential &quot;Un Homme et son péché&quot; was launched.

For the first month of World War II, Radio-Canada aired 24 hours a day, broadcasting war news from Europe. Also that year, the network broadcast its first Montreal Canadiens hockey game.

In 1940, another popular radio soap, &quot;Jeunesse dorée&quot;, made its debut. In 1941, the network, which had previously relied on Canadian Press reporters, launched its own news division and two shortwave radio stations in Montreal to serve francophones outside Quebec. Throughout the 1940s, its expansion inside Quebec was primarily through private affiliate stations.

In 1942, the network controversially refused to give airtime to the &quot;No&quot; side in the Conscription Plebiscite. Nonetheless, 72.9 per cent of Quebec voters were opposed.

In 1945, the International Service was launched. In 1946, the network launched an experimental FM station in Montreal (which would become CBFX), and expanded outside Quebec for the first time with the launch of CKSB as a private affiliate in St. Boniface, Manitoba, near Winnipeg.

The network also had seven privately owned affiliates:
*CHGB, Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière, 250 watts
*CHLT, Sherbrooke, 1,000 watts
*CHNC, New Carlisle, 1,000 watts
*CJBR, Rimouski, 1,000 watts (purchased by Radio-Canada in 1977)
*CJFP, Rivière-du-Loup, 250 watts
*CKRN, Rouyn, 250 watts
*CKCH, Hull, 250 watts
*CKCV, Quebec City, 1,000 watts

In 1948, the influential children&#x27;s series &quot;Tante Lucille&quot; and Gérard Pelletier&#x27;s public affairs program &quot;Les Idées en marche&quot; debuted. Also that year, three studios in Montreal&#x27;s King&#x27;s Hall building were destroyed in an explosion, leading Radio-Canada to centralize its operations in a new building on boulevard Dorchester.

In 1952, the network became autonomous from the CBC head office in Toronto. Previously, all programming decisions had to be reviewed by the Toronto staff in advance.

Through the 1960s, the network began to expand across Canada, taking over Toronto&#x27;s CJBC in October 1964, and launching Ottawa&#x27;s CBOF in 1964 and Vancouver&#x27;s CBUF in 1967. As well, influential broadcaster Lise Payette launched her first program, &quot;Place aux femmes&quot;, in 1965.

The network eliminated tobacco advertising in 1969, and eventually dropped all commercial advertising in 1974, except for Montreal Canadiens hockey games (which would move to the Radiomédia network in 1997). The Maison Radio-Canada, which remains the flagship facility for all of Radio-Canada&#x27;s broadcast services, was officially opened by Pierre Trudeau in 1973, and Radio-Canada&#x27;s FM network was launched in 1974. Through the remainder of the 1970s, the network began to directly acquire many of its private affiliate stations, including CHFA in Edmonton, CFRG in Gravelbourg and CFNS in Saskatoon, although with the CBC&#x27;s financial difficulties in the 1980s, this process was slowed down considerably.

The network was rebranded as Première Chaîne in 1997, concurrently with the rebranding of all of the CBC&#x27;s radio networks.

In 1999, Radio-Canada applied to the CRTC for a license to launch a third all-news station in Montreal, on the 690 AM frequency CBF had surrendered in 1997 when it moved to FM. The application was rejected. Radio-Canada filed an appeal of the decision with the Federal Court of Appeal, which denied the request in October of that year.

In 2002, two of the network&#x27;s last three remaining private affiliate stations, CKVM in Ville-Marie and CFLM in La Tuque, disaffiliated from the network, and the final private affiliate, CHLM in Rouyn-Noranda, was directly acquired by the network in 2004. The network now directly owns all of the stations that broadcast its programming.

On June 5, 2013, it was announced that Première Chaîne would be re-branded as Ici Première on August 9, 2013 as part of a wider re-branding of the CBC&#x27;s French-language outlets. This was a nod to the network&#x27;s system cue since the 1930s, &quot;Ici Radio-Canada&quot; (&quot;This is Radio-Canada&quot;). Following highly publicized complaints about the new &quot;Ici&quot; name, prompted primarily by the removal of the historic &quot;Radio-Canada&quot; brand, the new name was changed to Ici Radio-Canada Première instead.

==Programming==

===News===
Première&#x27;s flagship 60-minute news program is &quot;Ça nous regarde&quot;, a national news and discussion program similar to CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;The World at Six&quot; and &quot;As It Happens&quot;.

===Regional differences===
There are various regional adjustments to the national schedule. In the Atlantic provinces the national schedule airs live, with programme trailers announcing the broadcast time as one hour later.

All Première outlets produce a regional program in the morning (Monday to Friday) from their respective studios. For afternoon programs, in some provinces or regions, a program may originate from a studio in the largest station in their area and broadcast to all stations in a given region; for example: stations in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and St. John&#x27;s broadcasts the program produced in Moncton and CBEF Windsor broadcast the show produced in Toronto at CJBC.

In the summer, the morning show for the Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland are produced in turn by the stations of Halifax and of Charlottetown and the afternoon program of the Rimouski, Matane and Sept-Îles stations is produced alternately in each of the stations and broadcast on these three stations.

For Saturday morning shows, they are produced respectively in Moncton (for the Maritimes), Montreal (for the province of Quebec, except the Outaouais region), Ottawa (for Eastern Ontario and the Outaouais region), Sudbury (for Ontario, except Ottawa and Kenora), and Vancouver (for the Western provinces, as well as Kenora, Ontario).

In Northern Canada, CFWY-FM in Whitehorse, Yukon rebroadcasts the programs of CBUF-FM Vancouver. This station is not owned by the CBC, but by the Franco-Yukon Association. Conversely, Ici Nord Québec, anchored by CBFG-FM Chisasibi and transmitted to nine other First Nations communities in the Nord-du-Québec region via FM repeater transmitters, airs the same schedule as CBF-FM, but with four hours of regional programming inserted on weekdays, three of these in the Cree language.

The feed for Sirius XM Canada airs live across North America and simulcasted from CBF-FM in Montreal, meaning programmes are broadcast using the Eastern Time Zone. The entire schedule is aired as of 2016.

Listeners in Europe, Middle East and North Africa were able to receive direct programming from CBF-FM Montreal, with RCI&#x27;s own shows inserted into the schedule in the morning and evening. This ceased in June 2012.

===Holiday programming===
During certain holidays, a single program may be heard on a provincewide or a regionwide basis. In Quebec, stations outside Montreal, Quebec City and Outaouais airs a morning program and an afternoon show produced by different outlets in turn. In Ontario, holiday editions of morning shows are produced at CJBC, CBON or CBEF, and is broadcast on all three stations. In most holidays, the afternoon show is produced at the station that had not produced the morning show of that day. And all Première outlets in Western Canada present special pan-regional programming on holidays replacing local programs - &quot;Les matins de l&#x27;Ouest&quot; and &quot;Le retour de l&#x27;Ouest&quot;.

On Christmas Day and New Year&#x27;s Day, all stations nationwide carry the same schedule from Montreal, live or taped, depending on location. Also, on the weeks of Christmas and New Year&#x27;s, regional morning shows begin at 6:00 in all areas, except Montreal where it could begins at 5:00 or 6:00 one year and another.

==Stations==

In addition to primary production centres listed here, most stations in the network also serve a larger region through rebroadcasters. Due to the significant number of such rebroadcast frequencies, those are listed in each individual station&#x27;s article rather than here.

Historically, Première has broadcast primarily on the AM band, but many stations have moved over to FM. Over the years, a number of CBC radio transmitters with a majority of them on AM have either moved to FM or had shut down completely. &quot;See: List of defunct CBC radio transmitters in Canada&quot;

The first two creations were by writ, but little more is known about them, except that John de Huntingfield, who was created Baron Huntingfield in 1362, married Margery (or Margaret) de Welles, daughter of John de Welles, 4th Baron Welles. John was dead by December 1376, when Margery remarried. Both titles probably became extinct or fell into abeyance on the death of their first holders. The third creation, Baron Huntingfield, of Heveningham Hall in the County of Suffolk, was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1796 for Sir Joshua Vanneck, 3rd Baronet, Member of Parliament for Dunwich. His son, the second Baron, also represented this constituency in the House of Commons. His great-grandson, the fifth Baron (who succeeded his uncle), was Conservative Member of Parliament for Eye and Governor of Victoria. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the seventh Baron, who succeeded his father in 1994.

The Vanneck Baronetcy, of Putney in the County of Surrey, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1751 for Joshua Vanneck, a London merchant of Dutch origin. His eldest son, the second Baronet, represented Dunwich in Parliament. He was succeeded in this seat and the baronetcy by his younger brother, the third Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage as Baron Huntingfield in 1796.

Sir Peter Vanneck, Lord Mayor of London in 1978, was the second son of the fifth Baron.

The former seat of the Vanneck family was Heveningham Hall near Heveningham and Huntingfield in Suffolk. However, the house was sold to the government in 1970.

As of 30 June 2006, the present holder of the barony has not successfully proven his succession to the baronetcy and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant. However, the case is under review by the Registrar of the Baronetage (for more information follow this link).

<text>Assiniboia District refers to two historical districts of Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories. The name is taken from the Assiniboine First Nation.

==Historical usage==
&quot;For more information on the history of the provisional districts, see also Districts of the Northwest Territories&quot;

===(Old) District of Assiniboia===

The District of Assiniboia was a name used to describe the Red River Colony, mainly for official purposes, between 1812 and 1869. Nominally the district included all of the territory granted in the Selkirk Concession. However, much of this was ceded to the United States in 1818 (from the Treaty of 1818) and in 1838 the district was redefined as the circular region within 50 miles of Fort Garry, which was the junction of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. The actual area of settlement, centered at present-day Winnipeg, was limited to the Red River valley between Lower Fort Garry and Pembina, North Dakota, and the Assiniboine River valley between Winnipeg and Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. The District was governed by a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company-appointed Governor of Assiniboia, who was advised by members of the Council of Assiniboia.

In 1869 Rupert&#x27;s Land, including the District of Assiniboia, was transferred to Canada without consultation of the residents of the settlement. This, and the arrival of Canadian surveyors, led to the Red River Rebellion, in which a Provisional Government and Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia was established by Métis leader Louis Riel to negotiate the admission of the District as a province of Canada. The original proposal, which suggested that the new province consist of all of the fertile belt between Winnipeg and British Columbia, was rejected by the Canadian federal government as it conflicted with their plans to manage the settlement of the Northwest Territories directly. As a compromise, a small part of the district, consisting mainly of the settled areas, was admitted to Canada as the Province of Manitoba in 1870 though the federal government retained control of crown land and natural resources until 1930. In some accounts of the history of Manitoba, the term Old Assiniboia is used to describe the pre-1870 settlement, though the terms Red River Colony, Red River Settlement and Selkirk Settlement are more common.

===District of Assiniboia===

The (Second) District of Assiniboia was later created (1882) as a regional administrative district of Canada&#x27;s North-West Territories. Most of it was absorbed into the Province of Saskatchewan in 1905, except for the westernmost quarter, which became part of Alberta.

The east boundary of the district coincided with the modern Manitoba–Saskatchewan boundary, the line between the 29th and 30th ranges west of the First Meridian of the Dominion Land Survey. This boundary has jogs at each correction line. Any roads built on this boundary are now designated Road 174 West under the Manitoba system or Range Road 1300 under the Saskatchewan system.

The north boundary was the 9th Correction Line, approximately 52° north, now also designated Township Road 350.

The west boundary was the line between the 10th and 11th ranges west of the Fourth Meridian. This line, now designated Range Road 110, has jogs at each correction line. The northwest corner of the Assiniboia District is commemorated by a cairn 10 km south of Coronation, Alberta.

Between 1876 and 1883, Battleford (in the District of Saskatchewan) was the territorial capital of the North-West Territories. The territorial capital was moved to Regina, in Assiniboia, in 1883, and on the formation of the province of Saskatchewan in 1905, Regina became the capital of the province. Its location was chosen by Edgar Dewdney, the territorial lieutenant-governor. Dewdney had reserved for himself substantial land adjacent to the Canadian Pacific Railway line on the site of what became the town, and thereby considerably enriched himself. This was the occasion of a considerable scandal in the early days of the Territories.

The District of Assiniboia survived in its original geographical configuration as the Anglican Diocese of Qu&#x27;Appelle until the 1970s when the portion of the diocese (and former District of Assiniboia) lying within the province of Alberta was ceded to the Diocese of Calgary.

<doc id="482413" wikidata="Q659512" url="?curid=482413" title="Ici Musique">
<text>Ici Musique (stylized ICI Musique) is the French-language music radio service of Canada&#x27;s national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (&quot;Société Radio-Canada&quot;). It is the French equivalent of the English CBC Music, although it has a different programming focus.

==History==
The network was originally launched as &quot;Le FM de Radio-Canada&quot; in 1974, with stations in Montreal, Ottawa, Quebec City and Chicoutimi.

The network grew slowly. For a long time, its only full-fledged stations outside of Quebec were in Ottawa and Moncton. It presently covers the majority of Quebec, all provincial capitals (though Regina, Victoria, Edmonton, St. John&#x27;s, Fredericton and Charlottetown are only served by rebroadcasters) and other large cities such as Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver.

The network was rebranded as &quot;La chaîne culturelle&quot; (&quot;The cultural network&quot;) in 1997 and later as &quot;Espace musique&quot; in September 2004, the latter as part of a major repositioning of the CBC&#x27;s French services. Many high-brow cultural programs were moved to &quot;Première Chaîne&quot;, while the new &quot;Espace musique&quot; service adopted a more populist approach focusing on four genres – classical, jazz, world, and folk music – and French-language song.

 For about two weeks in late August / early September 2004 leading up to the Espace musique relaunch, the network did not have any name, at least officially. The network &quot;stunted&quot; with a continuous stream of classical music and jazz, aside from hourly newscasts simulcast from Première Chaîne and regular reminders that la Chaîne culturelle had shut down and (later) that it would relaunch as Espace musique on September 7.

The rebranding was controversial. The network&#x27;s previous format, largely classical music, had been similar to that of CBC Radio Two, and was indeed regarded by some as superior to its English-language counterpart, leading many cultural commentators to criticize the new format. However, Bureau of Broadcast Measurement ratings taken soon after the relaunch suggested that the service has indeed become more popular.
Unlike most CBC broadcast networks, from its inception until fall 2010, all &quot;Ici Musique&quot; transmitters aired the same programming simultaneously on all stations regardless of location, except for (from 2004 to 2010) two weekday evening programs that were interchanged on the British Columbia transmitters.

Since September 2010, the network has adopted the practice of the CBC&#x27;s other French-language networks, whereby network programs are broadcast live in the Eastern, Atlantic, and Newfoundland time zones, then aired on tape delay (at the same local times as in the Eastern time zone) in Western Canada. At the same time the network devolved responsibility for the 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (9:30-1:00 AT; formerly from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. / 10:00-4:00 AT) time slot to regional stations. Separate daytime programs were slated to be produced by each of the network&#x27;s originating stations - the exceptions having been CBAX-FM Halifax, which carried programming produced at CBAL-FM Moncton; and CBCX-FM Calgary / Edmonton, which carried regional programs from CKSB-FM Winnipeg.

On May 4, 2011, the network began transmitting on Sirius XM satellite radio channel 153 across North America. &quot;Ici musique chansons&quot; was later moved to channel 163.

On June 5, 2013, it was announced that Espace musique would be re-branded as ICI Musique as part of a wider re-branding of the CBC&#x27;s French-language outlets around the brand &quot;Ici&quot;. The changes took effect on-air in June 2014, along with the re-branding of the network&#x27;s website espace.mu as icimusique.ca.

On April 10, 2014, further budget cuts were announced for the CBC/Radio-Canada, affecting also Espace Musique, whose regional programming (namely &quot;Beau temps, mauvais temps&quot; on weekday mornings) was cancelled on June 20. Since then, the ICI Musique network feed has essentially been a retransmission of flagship CBFX-FM in Montreal.

<doc id="482418" wikidata="Q5500601" url="?curid=482418" title="Freedom Party of Ontario">
<text>The Freedom Party of Ontario (FPO; ) is a provincial political party in Ontario, Canada. It was founded on January 1, 1984, in London, Ontario by Robert Metz and Marc Emery. The Freedom Party has fielded candidates in every provincial election since 1985, and in several by-elections. It has also participated in numerous public policy debates, often on contentious social issues.

In 1980, a schism occurred in the libertarian movement in Ontario, with several members of the Libertarian Party, unhappy with its direction and democratic structure, left to follow the Objectivist Unparty. In 1984, the Unparty changed its name to the &quot;Freedom Party of Ontario&quot;.

==Ideology==
The Freedom Party&#x27;s founding principle is that &quot;every individual, in the peaceful pursuit of personal fulfillment, has an absolute right to his or her own life, liberty, and property.&quot; The Freedom Party membership&#x27;s stated objectives are four-fold: encouraging voters to vote for FPO candidates in provincial elections and by-elections, influencing government through the election of FPO candidates to the Ontario legislature, protecting every Ontarian&#x27;s right to life, liberty and property, and lastly building and supporting the FPO by becoming a network of individuals dedicated to carrying out the aforementioned principles, described in detail above.

The party has, from its inception in 1984, explained that &quot;the Freedom Party believes that the purpose of government is to protect our freedom of choice, not to restrict it.&quot; The party advocates government that takes into account only claims backed by evidence. It submits that all government laws and decisions must be logical, and must at all times serve the purpose of ensuring that no person&#x27;s life, liberty, or property is taken without his consent.

==History==

===Founding===

The Freedom Party of Ontario was founded by a number of people based in the London, Ontario area, including Robert Metz and Marc Emery of London, who had founded &quot;The London Tribune&quot; (a broadsheet daily newspaper) in London in 1980 and, later published the &quot;London Metrobulletin&quot; (beginning in March 1983). Toward the end of 1983, Metz assumed the registration of the Toronto-based Unparty which folded and closed its Toronto office. Elections Ontario approved the party&#x27;s name change on October 19, 1983. Because Metz and Emery were turning their attention to electoral politics, the final issue of the &quot;London Metrobulletin&quot; was published in December 1983. Freedom Party of Ontario was officially launched on January 1, 1984, with its head office in London. Freedom Party of Ontario&#x27;s founding platform was summarized in the statement: &quot;Freedom Party believes that the purpose of government is to protect our freedom of choice, not to restrict it.&quot;

===1984–2002===
The FPO was best known during the 1980s for its campaigns against censorship and provincial laws that restricted Sunday shopping. Robert Metz, the party&#x27;s first president, spoke for the FPO in 1987 when he argued that the Sunday shopping debate was fundamentally about freedom of choice for the retailer and consumer. Leading FPO members also opposed legal restrictions on pornography that depicts consensual sex between consenting adults, and opposed the prohibition of marijuana, arguing that the state did not have the right to legislate in such matters.

On economic issues, the FPO supported tax reductions and opposed provincial welfare programs. It was also critical of the Ontario Human Rights Commission and of affirmative action programs. Some prominent former members of Voice of Canadians (VOC), a now-defunct group that opposed official multiculturalism and official bilingualism, have affiliated with the FPO since the 1990s.

Metz became the first leader of the party in 1987, and served until 1994 when he was replaced by Jack Plant. Plant stepped down in 1997, and was replaced by Lloyd Walker. All of the party&#x27;s leaders between 1987 and 2002 were from London, and the party&#x27;s activities were organized primarily from that city. The party newsletter, &quot;Freedom Flyer&quot;, was published on an occasional basis, and back copies are available online.

The Freedom Party has opposed government restrictions on free speech and freedom of expression throughout its existence, arguing that the state has no right to intervene except in cases of fraud, defamation, or the commission of crimes such as sex with children. Marc Emery frequently challenged Canada&#x27;s censorship laws during his years as an FPO organizer, via the private bookstore he operated in London. He continued to do so after resigning from FPO in 1990.

The FPO took a civil libertarian stance on hate speech and the rights of individuals to express political opinions, whether those opinions are rational or irrational, unoffensive or offensive, popular or unpopular. In 1999, the London police wrote to Raphael Bergmann and Tyler Chilcott alleging that they were members of the Northern Alliance. The letter stated that, as they belonged to an &quot;extreme right-wing&quot; group they were &quot;required&quot; to report to the police to explain their opinions. The FPO&#x27;s then leader, Lloyd Walker requested that Solicitor-General David Tsubouchi provide a list of &quot;extreme&quot; political beliefs that could result in such police action. No response was provided by the government, and nothing more came of the matter. here. Bergmann and Chilcott were never FPO members and the party did not support their views, simply their right to express them.

===Since 2002 under leadership of Paul McKeever===
The party was partly restructured in 2002, when Oshawa lawyer Paul McKeever replaced Walker as party leader. McKeever argues that the FPO is now targeted toward building an electoral base and that a new organization, Freedom Party International, has taken on its prior advocacy role. FPI now publishes the former FPO journal, &quot;Consent&quot;.

McKeever (born 1966) has been the party&#x27;s leader since 2002. He graduated from Trent University with an Honours Bachelor of Science in 1989 and a Master of Arts from the University of Western Ontario in 1991 and a law degree from the same university in 1995. He currently practises civil litigation and employment law.

McKeever became a member of the Freedom Party of Ontario in 1992, joined its executive in 1999, and became party leader in 2002 following the resignation of Lloyd Walker. He is the party&#x27;s first leader not to reside in London, Ontario. McKeever is also owner and operator of the &quot;Mondo Politico&quot; website, which reviews the political positions of various parties, including his own.

McKeever was a candidate for the Freedom Party of Ontario in the 1999 election in Toronto Centre-Rosedale, where he received 344 votes, or 0.8% of all votes cast. In the 2003 provincial in the riding of Oshawa, he came in fifth out of six candidates with 518 votes or 1.3% of all votes cast. McKeever was the Freedom Party&#x27;s candidate in the March 30, 2006 Whitby—Ajax by-election and received 198 votes, 0.6% of all ballots cast. During the 2007 provincial election McKeever ran in London West where he received 234 votes, 0.5% of all ballots cast. He was a candidate in the September 17, 2009 provincial by-election in the Toronto riding of St. Paul&#x27;s and received 61 votes (0.2%).

Under McKeever&#x27;s leadership, the Freedom Party of Ontario nominated 24 candidates in the 2003 provincial election and 15 candidates in the 2007 provincial election. 56 Freedom Party candidates contested the 2011 provincial election and 42 Freedom Party candidates contested the 2014 provincial election. The Freedom Party of Canada has not nominated any candidates in federal elections.

The FPO promoted an electoral platform entitled &quot;The Right Direction&quot; for the 2003 election, arguing that with the PCs turning away from Mike Harris&#x27;s Common Sense Revolution, the FPO was the only remaining party with &quot;common sense&quot;.

On October 4, 2005, the FPO released its 2007 election platform. It focused on competition in health care and education, repealing price controls on electricity, the replacement of property taxes with consumption taxes, and the elimination of the provincial income tax.

The party failed to win any seats in the 2022 Ontario general election.

===Other Freedom parties===
The FPO is affiliated with the Freedom Party of Canada (FPC), an unregistered political party which was founded by Paul McKeever and Robert Metz on July 20, 2001. It has never run candidates for a federal election since its founding. The FPO is also affiliated with Freedom Party International, which is not a political party but an organization founded to advocate and promote the party&#x27;s philosophy, and to serve as the authority that must be consulted by any persons wishing to form an affiliated political party. FPO, FPC, FPUSA and FPI are not affiliated with the Freedom Party of British Columbia, the Freedom Party of Manitoba or other parties styled as &quot;Freedom Party&quot;.

<doc id="482420" wikidata="Q190884" url="?curid=482420" title="Viktor Chernomyrdin">
<text>Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin (, ; 9 April 19383 November 2010) was a Soviet and Russian politician and businessman. He was the Minister of Gas Industry of the Soviet Union (13 February 1985 – 17 July 1989), after which he became first chairman of Gazprom energy company and the second-longest-serving Prime Minister of Russia (1992–1998) based on consecutive years. He was a key figure in Russian politics in the 1990s and a participant in the transition from a planned to a market economy. From 2001 to 2009, he was Russia&#x27;s ambassador to Ukraine. After that, he was designated as a presidential adviser.

Chernomyrdin was known in Russia and Russian-speaking countries for his language style, which contained numerous malapropisms and syntactic errors. Many of his sayings became aphorisms and idioms in the Russian language, two examples being the expression &quot;We wanted the best, but it turned out like always.&quot; () and &quot;The thing that never happens just happened again&quot; ().

Chernomyrdin died on 3 November 2010 after a long illness. He was buried beside his wife in Novodevichy Cemetery on 5 November, and his funeral was broadcast live on Russian federal TV channels.

==Early life and education==
Chernomyrdin was born in Chernyi Otrog, Orenburg Oblast, Russian SFSR. His father was a labourer and Viktor was one of five children. Chernomyrdin completed school education in 1957 and found employment as a mechanic in an oil refinery in Orsk. He worked there until 1962, except for his military service (which lasted from 1957 to 1960). His other occupations on the plant during this period included machinist, operator and chief of technical installations.

In 1962, he was admitted to Kuybyshev Industrial Institute (which was later renamed Samara Polytechnical Institute). In his entrance exams he performed very poorly. He failed the maths sections of the test and had to take the exam again, getting a C. He got only one B, in Russian language, and Cs in the other tests. He was admitted only because of very poor competition. In 1966, he graduated from the institute. In 1972, he completed further studies at the Department of Economics of the Union-wide Polytechnic Institute by correspondence.

==Soviet political and government career==
In 1961, Chernomyrdin became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). From 1967–73, he served as an industrial administrator for the city party committee in Orsk. From 1973–78, he was served in an appointed position as the deputy chief engineer and director for a natural gas plant in Orenburg. In 1978, he moved to Moscow to work for the Central Committee of the CPSU, becoming an apparatchik. From then until 1982, he worked in the heavy industry arm of the Central Committee.

In 1982, he was appointed deputy minister of the natural gas industries of the Soviet Union. Concurrently, beginning from 1983, he directed Glavtyumengazprom, an industry association for natural gas resource development in Tyumen Oblast. In 1985, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had him appointed to serve as minister of the natural gas industry, a role he held until 1989. 

==Founder of Gazprom==
In August 1989, under the leadership of Chernomyrdin, the Ministry of Gas Industry was transformed into the &quot;State Gas Concern&quot;, Gazprom, which became the country&#x27;s first state-corporate enterprise. Chernomyrdin was elected its first chairman. The company was still controlled by the state, but now the control was exercised through shares of stock, 100% of which were owned by the state.

Chernomyrdin unsuccessfully ran in the 1990 Russian Supreme Soviet election.

When the Soviet Union dissolved in late 1991, assets of the former Soviet state in the gas sector were transferred to newly created national companies such as Ukrgazprom and Turkmengazprom. Gazprom kept assets located in the territory of Russia, and was able to secure a monopoly in the gas sector.

Gazprom&#x27;s political influence increased markedly after Russian President Boris Yeltsin appointed the company&#x27;s chairman Chernomyrdin as his Prime Minister in 1992. Rem Viakhirev took Chernomyrdin&#x27;s place as chairman both of the board of directors and of the managing committee. Gazprom was one of the backbones of the country&#x27;s economy in 1990s, though the company underperformed during that decade. In the 2000s, however, Gazprom became the largest extractor of natural gas in the world and the largest Russian company.

== Deputy prime minister of Russia ==
In May 1992, President Boris Yeltsin appointed Chernomyrdin as deputy prime minister in charge of fuel and energy. Chernomyrdin began his role in June, serving in the Cabinet of Boris Yeltsin and Yegor Gaidar, serving under acting prime minister Yegor Gaidar. Chernomyrdin&#x27;s appointment came at the behest of the Civic Union political union.

Chernomyrdin&#x27;s loyalty to the industrial lobby persisted.

==Prime Minister of Russia==
Gaidar was considered a liberal political reformist, and the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of Russia refused to confirm his nomination to serve as permanent prime minister. This led Yeltsin to instead nominate the Chernomyrdin. Chernomyrdin was not regarded to have established much of a political identity for himself up to that point, making his nomination a surprise. However, the fact that he had staked out no political positions during his brief time in Gaidar&#x27;s cabinet made it easier for Chernomyrdin&#x27;s nomination to win sufficient approval. On 14 December 1992, Yeltsin formallynominated him. He was confirmed the same day by the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies.

According to Felipe Turover Chudínov, who was a senior intelligence officer with the foreign-intelligence directorate of the KGB, Chernomyrdin secretly decreed in the early 1990s that Russia would become an international hub for narcotics trafficking including importing cocaine and heroin from South America and heroin from Central Asia and Southeast Asia and exporting narcotics to Europe, North America including the United States and Canada, and China and the Pacific Rim.

While he had been critical of his predecessor Gaidar, Chernomyrdin largely continued Gaidar&#x27;s policies.

Alongside U.S. vice president Al Gore, he served as co-chair of the Gore–Chernomyrdin Commission. The commission met biannually to discuss U.S.–Russia cooperation, but produced few tangible results. One outcome was U.S.–Russian cooperation in space exploration. In September 1993, he and Gore announced plans for the two nations to build a new space station, which eventually became the International Space Station. They also reached an agreement for the United States to begin participating heavily in the &quot;Mir&quot; programme in advance of the launch of the new space station, setting the ground for the Shuttle–Mir Programme.

In April 1995, he formed a political bloc called Our Home – Russia, which won 10% of the vote and 55 seats to come third in the 1995 Russian legislative election.

In 1995, Chernomyrdin signed a decree calling for the development of a national strategy for tiger conservation

On 18 June 1995, as a result of Shamil Basayev-led terrorists taking over 1500 people hostage in Budyonnovsk, negotiations between Chernomyrdin and Basayev led to a compromise which became a turning point for the First Chechen War. In exchange for the hostages, the Russian government agreed to halt military actions in Chechnya and begin a series of negotiations.

When Boris Yeltsin was undergoing a heart operation on 6 November 1996, Chernomyrdin served as Acting President for 23 hours.

Chernomyrdin remained Prime Minister until his sudden dismissal on 23 March 1998. Following the 1998 Russian financial crisis in August, Yeltsin re-appointed Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister, and attempted to groom him as his successor. However, the Duma twice refused to confirm Chernomyrdin as the head of the government. Rather than risking a third rejection and thus forcing the dissolution of the State Duma and political crisis, Chernomyrdin withdrew his nomination and the president asked the more popular Yevgeny Primakov to form a new cabinet.

==Diplomatic career==

During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 Chernomyrdin was a special envoy of Russia in Yugoslavia. Chernomyrdin also disclosed his intent to run for president of Russia in 2000.

In December 1999 Chernomyrdin was elected a member of the State Duma. In May 2001, Vladimir Putin appointed Chernomyrdin Ambassador of Russia to Ukraine. This action was interpreted by some Russian media agencies as a move to distance Chernomyrdin from the centre of Russian politics. In 2003, he dismissed talk of an apology for the Holodomor Famine made by the Soviet Union.

In February 2009 Chernomyrdin again strained the relations between Ukraine and Russia when he in an interview said &quot;It is impossible to come to an agreement on anything with the Ukrainian leadership. If different people come in, we&#x27;ll see&quot;. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a response it could declare Chernomyrdin &quot;persona non-grata&quot; over the row.

On 11 June 2009, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev relieved Chernomyrdin as Russian Ambassador in Kyiv, and appointed him as &quot;presidential adviser and special presidential representative on economic cooperation with CIS member countries&quot;. In a parting shot at the Ukrainian government, Chernomyrdin stated that Russia should not apologise to Ukraine over voicing its suspicions about Ukraine being unable to pay for its natural gas, and further stated that Russia wants Ukraine to pay for the gas it consumes, and hence Russia is right to be concerned about the solvency of the Ukrainian state.

==Death==

Chernomyrdin died on the morning of 3 November 2010 after a long illness. According to people close to Chernomyrdin, such as singer Lev Leshchenko, the former Prime Minister was deeply affected by the death of his wife Valentina, seven and a half months earlier.

Chernomyrdin was buried beside his wife in Novodevichy Cemetery on 5 November 2010. On 3 November Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed an order to show Chernomyrdin&#x27;s funeral in a live broadcast on Russian federal TV channels (only the funerals of the former President Boris Yeltsin and Patriarch Alexy II were granted the same right in recent years). The head of the Presidential Administration of Russia, Sergey Naryshkin, supervised the funeral ceremony.
Condolences on the death of Chernomyrdin were voiced on 3 November 2010 by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, other state figures in Russia and Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.

== Sayings ==
In Russian-speaking countries, Chernomyrdin is known for his numerous malapropisms and syntactically incorrect speech, somewhat similar to Irish bulls. His idioms received the name &quot;Chernomyrdinki&quot;, and are somewhat comparable to Bushisms in style and effect. One of his expressions &quot;We wanted (to do) it better, but it turned out as always&quot; (&quot;Хотели как лучше, а получилось как всегда&quot; in Russian) about the economic reforms in Russia was widely quoted (sometimes rendered in English as &quot;We wanted the best, you know the rest&quot; or &quot;We tried our best, you know the rest.&quot;) The phrase was uttered after a highly unsuccessful monetary exchange performed by the Russian Central Bank in July 1993.

<doc id="482426" wikidata="Q4862674" url="?curid=482426" title="Baron Newborough">
<text>Baron Newborough is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Ireland; both titles are extant. The first creation came in 1716 in favour of George Cholmondeley, later 2nd Earl of Cholmondeley. See Marquess of Cholmondeley for further history of this creation. 

The second creation came in 1776 in favour of Sir Thomas Wynn, 3rd Baronet. He represented Caernarvonshire, St Ives and Beaumaris in the House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Caernarvonshire. His second wife, Maria Stella, became famous because she asserted to be the daughter of Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans and that she was exchanged at birth with the future King Louis Philippe I. Their son, the second Baron, represented Caernarvonshire in Parliament. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother. 

The third Baron served as High Sheriff of Anglesey in 1847. On his death the titles passed to his grandson, the fourth Baron (the son of the Hon. Thomas John Wynn). He died as a result of an illness contracted on active service during the First World War and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Baron. 

When the fifth Baron died in 1957 the titles were inherited by his first cousin, the sixth Baron. He was the son of the Hon. Charles Henry Wynn, third son of the third Baron. He was succeeded in 1965 by his eldest son as the seventh Baron. the titles are held by the seventh Baron&#x27;s son, the eighth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1998.

The Wynn Baronetcy, of Bodvean in the County of Caernarfon, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 25 October 1742 for the first Baron&#x27;s grandfather Thomas Wynn. He represented Caernarfon in the House of Commons and was also a court official. His son, the second Baronet, represented both Caernarfon and Caernarvonshire in Parliament. He was succeeded by his son, the third Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage in 1776.

The family seat is no longer Peplow Hall, near Hodnet, Shropshire. The family also own the 12,500 acres Rhug Estate near Corwen, Denbighshire (the new family seat) and once owned Glynllifon (Plas Glynlifon), near Llandwrog, Gwynedd, Wales.

<doc id="482427" wikidata="Q7094822" url="?curid=482427" title="Ontario Libertarian Party">
<text>The Ontario Libertarian Party (OLP; ) is a minor libertarian party in the Canadian province of Ontario. Founded in 1975 by Bruce Evoy and Vince Miller, the party was inspired by the 1972 formation of the United States Libertarian Party. The party is guided by a charter of principles, and its own Ontario charter of rights and freedoms.

In the 2018 Ontario general election, the Libertarian Party ran a candidate in a majority of the province&#x27;s electoral districts. Jacques Boudreau was appointed interim party leader in March 2021, replacing the departing leader Keith Komar. In October 2021, Mark Snow was elected leader at the Party&#x27;s convention. Under Snow, the party promotes an Ontario charter of rights which includes a section on immigration restrictions based on the eligibility of obtaining a job at an English speaking workplace. The party fielded only 16 candidate in the 2022 Ontario general election, over 100 fewer candidates than the province&#x27;s previous election held in 2018.

In 2024, its leader Mark Snow ran in a by-election in Bay of Quinte. He placed last out of 7 candidates with 129 votes or 0.35%.

==Election results==
In 1995, under the leadership of John Shadbolt, the party&#x27;s total vote declined to 6,085 votes. Shadbolt resigned one day after the 1995 election, and was replaced by George Dance on an interim basis. Sam Apelbaum was chosen as the party&#x27;s full-time leader at a convention in October 1996.

In the 2007 general election, the party fielded 25 candidates and obtained a total of 9,249 votes.

In the 2011 general election, the party ran 51 candidates and won a total of 19,387 votes, 0.45% of the popular vote, more than double the number of candidates and votes received in 2007.

The party&#x27;s most successful election was in the 2014 general election, with Libertarian candidates receiving 0.81% of the vote.

The party has never won a seat in any Ontario general election.

<doc id="482438" wikidata="Q132040" url="?curid=482438" title="Jack McConnell">
<text>Jack Wilson McConnell, Baron McConnell of Glenscorrodale, (born 30 June 1960) is a Scottish politician who served as First Minister of Scotland and Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland from 2001 to 2007. McConnell served as the Minister for Finance from 1999 to 2000 and Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs from 2000 to 2001. He has been a Labour life peer in the House of Lords since 2010 and previously served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Motherwell and Wishaw from 1999 to 2011. McConnell held the Presidency of the Conference of European Regions with Legislative Power (REGLEG) during November 2003 to November 2004.

Born in Irvine, Ayrshire, McConnell studied at the University of Stirling and worked as a mathematics teacher at Lornshill Academy. His political career began when he was elected to Stirling District Council, while he was still teaching. He served as a member of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, having campaigned in favour of a Scottish Parliament in the 1997 devolution referendum. Elected to serve as an MSP for the Motherwell and Wishaw constituency in the 1999 Scottish Parliament election, McConnell was appointed Minister for Finance under the Donald Dewar government. After Dewar&#x27;s death in 2000, he ran unsuccessfully for the leadership of the Labour Party in Scotland, having been defeated by Henry McLeish. McLeish appointed McConnell as Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs.

In 2001, McLeish resigned in the aftermath of the Officegate scandal and McConnell was elected unopposed as the Scottish Labour leader. He was appointed First Minister on 22 November 2001, becoming the youngest office holder. As first minister, he implemented a ban on smoking in public places, signed a Co-operation Agreement with Malawi, and successfully bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games to be hosted in Glasgow. In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the Labour Party in Scotland became the second largest party, with the SNP having one seat more. This therefore lead to McConnell losing office, becoming the first (and as of 2025, only) First Minister to have been defeated in office, and as of 2025, the last Labour First Minister of Scotland in office. 

After losing office as first minister, McConnell sat as the Leader of the Opposition in Holyrood, until his resignation as leader. He sat as a backbencher and stood down as an MSP in the 2011 election. In 2010, McConnell became a member of the House of Lords of the United Kingdom. He made a commitment to continuing his work to tackle poverty in Africa and to develop the relationship between Scotland and Malawi.
==Early life and education==

Jack Wilson McConnell was born on 30 June 1960 in Irvine, Ayrshire. He is the eldest of four children born to William Wilson McConnell (1937–2018) and Elizabeth McCallum McConnell (née Jack; 1936–2020). McConnell was brought up on Glenscorrodale Farm near Lamlash on the Isle of Arran, where his father was a sheep farmer and a member of the Arran Farmer’s Society. He was educated at Lamlash Primary and Arran High School.

McConnell attended the University of Stirling, where he was President of the Students&#x27; Association from 1980 to 1982 and National Union of Students Scotland Vice-President from 1982 to 1983. He met Margo MacDonald and Richard Leonard at university. In the late 1970s, he occupied the principal&#x27;s office in protest against student homelessness. He also took part in a siege to occupy the administration offices at the university and slept in sleeping bags in the university’s court room. He graduated in 1983 with a B.Sc. Dip.Ed.

==Early career==
After graduating, McConnell worked as a mathematics teacher at Lornshill Academy in Alloa, Clackmannanshire. In 1984, McConnell was elected to Stirling District Council, while still teaching at Lornshill. He served as Treasurer from 1988 until 1992, and was the Leader of the council from 1990 to 1992.

== Early political career ==
McConnell initially joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) when he was 16 years old. After trying to come to terms with Scottish nationalism, he suspended his membership and instead joined the Scottish Labour Party when he was 19.

From 1992 to 1998, McConnell served as the General Secretary of the Labour Party in Scotland. His major breakthrough was in his handling of the 1997 General Election success, where Labour attained a large overall majority victory over the Conservatives. Together the Labour Party in Scotland, the Scottish Liberal Democrats, and the Scottish National Party eliminated every seat the Conservatives held in Scotland. In 1998, he served as a member of the Scottish Constitutional Convention where he pioneered the Scottish devolution referendum success, establishing the Scottish Parliament.

As a strong proponent of Scottish devolution, McConnell helped push for reform. Between 1989 and 1998 he was a member of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, where he was playing an important role in the creation of the Scotland Act, which created a Scottish Parliament for the first time.

== Election to Holyrood (1999)==
As General Secretary, he managed the Labour Party in Scotland&#x27;s successful devolution referendum campaign in 1997. Following the successful devolution campaign and the creation of a Scottish Parliament, McConnell was elected as an MSP, for Motherwell and Wishaw, in the first Scottish Parliament in May 1999.

== In government (1999–2001) ==
===Dewar government===
He was appointed immediately by Donald Dewar, the then First Minister, to the post of Minister of Finance. As Finance Minister one of his primary jobs was to establish the budgeting procedures for the new Scottish government, which included consulting the public on budget priorities. As Minister responsible for External Relations he established Concordats with the UK Government and opened Scotland House in Brussels.

McConnell was elected an MSP in the first Scottish Parliament elections in 1999. He was appointed Minister for Finance in the new Scottish Executive by then First Minister Donald Dewar. One of his first moves as Finance Minister was to establish the budgeting procedures for the new Scottish Executive, including publishing a consultation document asking the public and MSPs how the budget should be spent. His department also passed the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000 through Parliament, which set out the finance and auditing procedures of the Executive.

=== McLeish government ===

On 11 October 2000, Dewar died of a brain haemorrhage. After the Labour leadership intervened to stop the Enterprise Minister Henry McLeish being appointed Dewar&#x27;s successor without a vote, McConnell stood in the leadership contest. The election was held on Saturday 21 October, only 72 hours after Dewar&#x27;s funeral, and the surprise result saw McConnell defeated with 36 votes to McLeish&#x27;s 44 votes.

McLeish appointed him Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs. Some analysts considered this post to be a &quot;poisoned chalice&quot;, as he would be required to resolve both a crisis in the Scottish Qualifications Authority over exam marking, and pay disputes with the teaching unions.

==Leadership of the Scottish Labour Party==
McLeish resigned as first minister on 8 November 2001 over the Officegate scandal, regarding the sub let of his constituency office. McConnell was seen by many political analysts as the likely successor and he later launched his bid for leader. On 13 November, McConnell held a press conference in Edinburgh after reports emerged he had an extra-marital affair seven years prior. He admitted to having an affair and in a statement with his wife, Bridget McConnell, he stated: &quot;If I become first minister, it would be very wrong for my family or anybody else to suffer because my behaviour then is still a secret today. That is why we are now being open about the fact that I did have an affair seven years ago. At the time I made mistakes, including denying the facts publicly and privately&quot;.

McConnell emerged as the only candidate and on 17 November, he was officially elected unopposed as Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland after receiving the support of 97.23% of MSPs. In his acceptance speech, he stated he was &quot;deeply honoured to receive such overwhelming support&quot; and highlighted that much work still needed to be done &quot;to make devolution a success&quot; and achieve &quot;first class public services&quot;.

== First Minister of Scotland (2001–2007) ==

===First term; 2001–2003 ===
====Nomination====

McConnell was nominated for the post of First Minister by a vote of the Scottish Parliament on 22 November, defeating Scottish National Party leader John Swinney, Scottish Conservative leader David McLetchie and Independent MSP Dennis Canavan by 70 votes to 34, 19 and 3 respectively. On 27 November, the Queen issued him a Royal Warrant of Appointment and he was sworn in at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. As a result of him becoming First Minister, he was appointed Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland and to the Privy Council, earning the title &#x27;The Right Honourable&#x27; for life. McConnell continued to lead the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition that had existed under the Dewar and McLeish administrations.

==== Cabinet appointments ====

Shortly after being appointed McConnell began making appointments to his cabinet and announced his cabinet appointments on 27 November 2001. He announced his junior ministers later on the same day. Jim Wallace remained in the post of deputy first minister while Cathy Jamieson took over Mr McConnell&#x27;s education brief and Wendy Alexander and Ross Finnie remained as ministers. Sam Galbraith and Angus MacKay stood down and Jackie Baillie, Sarah Boyack and Tom McCabe reshuffled out of government, while Susan Deacon was offered the post of social justice minister but refused the offer and moved to the backbenches. Cathy Jamieson, Mike Watson, Malcolm Chisholm, Iain Gray, Patricia Ferguson and Andy Kerr were all promoted to cabinet.

Following the appointment of his first government, McConnell used the first meeting of his newly formed cabinet that he intended for his administration to focus on the priorities of both the country and its people, pledging for unnecessary distractions to be avoided. Speaking during the first meeting of his cabinet, McConnell told his ministerial team he wished for them to &quot;get rid of unnecessary paperwork and diversions&quot; in order for ministers to be able to focus on the &quot;key areas&quot;. McConnell also advised his cabinet that he was not seeking a large volume of new initiatives and policies for his administration, but rather that he remained committed to the policy areas of the previous administration. A spokesperson for the Scottish Executive said that McConnell had told his cabinet for the need to &quot;focus on delivering what is already there&quot; as he felt it was important that his administration &quot;makes sure we are delivering on the targets that have been set&quot;.

One of the earliest announcements by the new executive under McConnell was the ability for the Scottish Parliament to raise or lower income tax by up to 3p in the pound would not be invoked under a McConnell administration. McConnell announced that under his premiership, the Scottish Executive would not change its position on issues such as private involvement in public services, proportional representation for local government elections and the financial independence of the Scottish Parliament.

====Education====

In 2002, McConnell pledged that the Scottish Executive would commit to building 100 new schools across Scotland by 2006. In order to achieve this, McConnell advocated for the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPP), stating &quot;we&#x27;ll work together to sort out how we give people maximum return for every one of their pounds we are spending&quot;. 

He was a strong advocate for teachers in Scotland to have the ability to move between primary and secondary schools to aid the transition process of children from primary school to secondary school. One of McConnell&#x27;s spokesperson said that McConnell had been driven to implement policy changes on the backdrop of &quot;children making the transition can have some problems. The first minister will be setting out the first steps towards addressing what is a problem that has been around for as long as we can remember&quot;.

In November 2002, McConnell announced plans that would allow Head Teachers in Scotland to have more authority in regards to setting their own standards and priorities for their respective schools.

==== Sporting event bids ====
In February 2002, Scotland joined forces with the Republic of Ireland in a bid to host the 2008 European Football Championship. Whilst he was initially unconvinced that it was worth spending around £100 million on the tournament, he later put his support behind the joint bid with the Republic of Ireland to host the tournament.

Although the bid lost out to Austrian and Switzerland joint bid, McConnell later supported other attempts to land major supporting events including London&#x27;s successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games and Glasgow&#x27;s bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. In December 2005, Glasgow formally launched its candidacy to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The launch of the bid was attended by McConnell alongside the leader of Glasgow City Council Steven Purcell at Hampden Park. Speaking at the launch, McConnell acknowledged that Scotland was the &quot;first country to declare its interest in hosting the games&quot; and additionally was the &quot;first country to nominate its preferred city&quot;. Glasgow was selected by Commonwealth Games Scotland over Edinburgh, who had previously hosted the 1970 and 1986 edition of the games.

==== Sectarianism ====
In December 2002, McConnell launched his government&#x27;s campaign against sectarianism.

=== Second term; 2003–2007 ===
====Re–election====
McConnell was re elected MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw at the Scottish Parliament elections. The Labour Party in Scotland won 50 seats, the largest number, and formed another coalition government with the Liberal Democrats which won 17 seats. On 15 May, McConnell was re appointed First Minister of Scotland and on the same day the Scottish government published A Partnership for a Better Scotland which set out the government&#x27;s priorities for the four-year term ahead.

This was followed by the “Fresh Talent initiative” which was created and developed to focus at addressing the demographic decline in Scotland and ageing Scottish population by attracting young and skilled immigrants, primarily from other European Union countries (such as Poland and Slovakia primarily) to be attracted to Scotland as a place to live and work.

==== Public smoking ban ====

One of McConnell&#x27;s most significant pieces of legislation to be introduced to the Scottish Parliament under his premiership was the successful campaign to ban smoking in Scottish public places, such as pubs, public transport and restaurants, making Scotland the first country within the United Kingdom to do so, which led to McConnell receiving praise for his leadership on this issue, ultimately leading other countries to follow.

The Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005 was formally ratified in Scots law on 26 March 2006.

====31st G8 summit====

As the United Kingdom, and ultimately Scotland, was scheduled to host the 31st G8 summit at the Gleneagles Hotel, McConnell expressed his wish for the UK Government to pay for any and all associated costs as a result of hosting the summit and claimed that the Scottish Executive was being placed in an &quot;intolerable position&quot;. Under McConnell, the executive warned that it would make the costs of security and policing the event public. 

McConnell&#x27;s demands for the UK Government to pay the costs of policing and security were met with opposition from HM Treasury, and it was later revealed that the treasury provided only £20 million towards the cost. In the months prior to the summit, the Scottish Executive expressed their concerns over the associated costs of hosting the event and a &quot;potentially very serious situation&quot; due to the fact that costs associated with the summit &quot;would inevitably be in the public domain&quot;. It was suggested that the Scottish Executive would launch a formal dispute with the UK Government in response to any perceived lack of progress over funding the summit. 

Despite assurances to the Scottish Parliament in May 2005 that the cost of hosting the G8 summit &quot;would be nowhere near £100 million&quot;, overall cost of hosting the event was estimated to be £90.9 million. In addition to the £20 million contributed by HM Treasury, the Foreign Office contributed £10 million whilst the Scottish Executive was expected to pay the remaining £65 million.

Despite concerns over the cost and disagreement with the UK Government over funding, McConnell attended the summit held between 6–8 July 2005 and welcomed international leaders who were invited to the conference to Glasgow Prestwick Airport on arrival.

==== 2007 Scottish election ====
The Scottish Parliament general election of 3 May 2007 saw McConnell re elected as the MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw with a majority of 5,938 votes, representing 48% of the vote with a turnout of 50.3%. The Labour Party in Scotland was defeated by the SNP with the SNP winning 47 seats to Labour&#x27;s 46, leaving the SNP short of an overall majority in the Parliament.

==Post premiership==

=== Labour in opposition; 2007–2011 ===

==== Leader of the Opposition ====
As Labour was left the second largest party in Holyrood, the SNP was invited first to form a government. The Lib Dems turned down a coalition deal with the SNP and Scottish Greens and ruled out a deal with Labour. On 16 May 2007, the election to nominate a first minister in the Scottish Parliament was held, with Alex Salmond receiving 49 votes to 46, as the Lib Dems and Conservatives abstained. The following day, the SNP officially formed the first nationalist administration of the Scottish Executive and McConnell became Leader of the Opposition. 

On 17 May 2007, McConnell told Salmond he would abstain in a Parliament vote to appoint ministers. In his first speech as opposition leader, McConnell listed a series of &#x27;hypocritical&#x27; remarks that SNP ministers had made about the Labour administration.

As Leader of the Opposition in Holyrood, McConnell took part in First Minister&#x27;s Questions (FMQs). In one session of FMQs, he claimed the new SNP administration was making several U-turns on transport policy and its position on student debt and council taxes.

==== Resignation as leader ====
On 15 August 2007, McConnell announced his intention to resign as Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland. In a statement, he said it was his &quot;honour&quot; to serve as leader and empthasised the need for Labour to learn lessons following its defeat in May. Immediately after his resignation, he was nominated by Prime Minister Gordon Brown to succeed Richard Wildash as British High Commissioner to Malawi. McConnell was succeeded as leader by Wendy Alexander.

==== Backbench MSP ====
After his resignation, McConnell sat in Labour&#x27;s opposition backbenches at Holyrood and continued to represent his Motherwell and Wishaw constituency until the 2011 Scottish Parliament election. On 28 May 2010, it was announced that McConnell would be made a life peer and enter the House of Lords as a working peer on behalf of the Labour Party.

=== House of Lords; 2010–present ===

On 28 June 2010, he was created a life peer as Baron McConnell of Glenscorrodale, of the Isle of Arran in Ayrshire and Arran, and was introduced in the House of Lords the same day. In August 2010 he announced that he would not be seeking re-election to the Scottish Parliament.

===Other positions===
In August 2007, he was appointed an adviser to the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative in Malawi and Rwanda, and in October 2008, he was appointed by Gordon Brown as the Prime Minister&#x27;s Special Representative on Conflict Resolution Mechanisms, a position which ceased following Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 2010 General election.

He is a UK Ambassador for Action for Children; a Fellow of the 48 Group Club, which promotes relationships between the United Kingdom and China and an Ambassador for Pump Aid. On 8 March 2012, Optical Express announced the appointment of Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale joining the Board as non executive director. He was a non executive director at DCM (Optical Holdings) from 2011 to 2015. As of 30 November 2018, McConnell holds the position of Chancellor at the University of Stirling.

On 31 October 2024, it was announced that McConnell would lead a Black Sea regeneration group.

==Personal life==
In 1990, McConnell married Bridget McConnell, a cultural administrator and former chief executive officer of Glasgow Life. They met in the late 1980s, where they both worked at Stirling District Council. On 5 March 1991, a sheriff ruled McConnell could become the legal father of Bridget&#x27;s children, Hannah and Mark; whom she had in her previous marriage with Richard Brown. During McConnell&#x27;s leadership bid for the Scottish Labour Party in November 2001, he revealed in a press conference that he had been involved in an extra marital affair seven years previously. He admitted the affair had been &quot;an open secret for seven years&quot; and &quot;It caused significant hurt to a number of people and I regret that very much to this day&quot;.

In 2016, McConnell refused to bail out his sister, Anne McConnell, who was jailed for stealing £9,000 from a disabled pensioner&#x27;s bank account. She told police she needed money to pay her mortgage and blamed her crime on her menopause and hoped &quot;Jack would help her pay it back&quot;.

<text>Metal Church is an American heavy metal band formed in 1980. Originally based in San Francisco, California, they relocated to Aberdeen, Washington the following year and briefly called themselves Shrapnel. Led by guitarist and songwriter Kurdt Vanderhoof, the band has released thirteen studio albums and is considered to be an integral part of the then-emerging Seattle heavy metal music scene of the 1980s. They achieved considerable popularity that decade, with two of their first three albums entering the Top 100 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The band&#x27;s early lyrical topics, such as conflict and paranoia, later expanded into philosophical, political and social commentary.

Metal Church has had a revolving lineup of vocalists, guitarists, bassists and drummers throughout its -year career, and Vanderhoof remains the group&#x27;s sole consistent creative force, despite reducing his role strictly to composition in 1986 after tiring of performing live. The &quot;classic&quot; lineup of Vanderhoof, vocalist David Wayne, guitarist Craig Wells, bassist Duke Erickson, and drummer Kirk Arrington recorded the band&#x27;s first two studio albums, &quot;Metal Church&quot; (1984) and their major breakthrough &quot;The Dark&quot; (1986). By the end of the 1980s, Vanderhoof and Wayne had parted ways with the band and were replaced by vocalist Mike Howe and guitarist John Marshall, respectively. Metal Church&#x27;s popularity continued with their third album &quot;Blessing in Disguise&quot; (1989), which spawned one of their best-known songs &quot;Badlands&quot;. After releasing two more studio albums with Howe, &quot;The Human Factor&quot; (1991) and &quot;Hanging in the Balance&quot; (1993), the band first broke up in 1996.

Metal Church reformed in 1998 with most of their &quot;classic&quot; lineup, including Vanderhoof&#x27;s return to performance, resulting in the band&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Masterpeace&quot; (1999); however, internal conflicts and Wayne&#x27;s second departure from the band in 2001 resulted in a second hiatus. Metal Church resurfaced in 2003, with Ronny Munroe replacing Wayne, and the band underwent a few lineup changes within the next six years, leaving Vanderhoof as the only remaining original member. Following their third disbandment in July 2009, the group reunited for the third time in October 2012, and released their tenth studio album &quot;Generation Nothing&quot; a year later. Following Munroe&#x27;s departure in the fall of 2014, Metal Church considered disbanding for the third time before Howe was rehired in April 2015 as their lead singer. He recorded two more albums with the band, which had enjoyed a renewed popularity during the mid-to-late 2010s, before his death on July 26, 2021. Howe has since been replaced by Marc Lopes, who debuted on Metal Church&#x27;s thirteenth studio album &quot;Congregation of Annihilation&quot; (2023).

==History==
===Formative years (1980–1984)===
Then-based in San Francisco, guitarist Kurdt Vanderhoof formed the band in 1980 with various musicians. This era included a brief audition period with future Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich. The three-song, instrumental &quot;Red Skies&quot; demo, was released in 1981, and featured Vanderhoof, guitarist Rick Condrin, bassist Steve Hott, and drummer Aaron Zimpel.

Vanderhoof returned to his hometown of Aberdeen in 1981 and began the new group Shrapnel with Craig Wells, Duke Erickson, drummer Tom Weber, and vocalist Mike Murphy. Murphy departed before their next demo, which was recorded without vocals, and Weber departed shortly thereafter. The enlistment of drummer Kirk Arrington and vocalist David Wayne completed the group&#x27;s classic lineup. They released the demo &quot;Four Hymns&quot; and spent following years touring and accruing material, readopting the Metal Church moniker in 1983. The song &quot;Death Wish&quot; is featured on the compilation album &quot;Northwest Metalfest&quot;.

=== First two records and commercial success (1984–1988) ===
In July 1984, Metal Church released its self-titled debut album, which included three songs from the &quot;Four Hymns&quot; demo and a cover version of Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Highway Star&quot;. They sold 70,000 copies of the album independently before signing to Elektra. According to Wayne, Ulrich and Metallica bandmate James Hetfield urged Elektra to sign the band before another label could.

By the time Metal Church released their second studio album, &quot;The Dark&quot;, in October 1986, they were touring with high-profile acts including Metallica. &quot;The Dark&quot; was a commercial success, helped by the fact that the band&#x27;s first music video, &quot;Watch the Children Pray&quot;, received frequent airplay on MTV. As a result, the album managed to enter the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and saw Metal Church support the album with a world tour that lasted from October 1986 to July 1987, playing with bands such as King Diamond, Celtic Frost, Testament, Overkill, D.R.I., Trouble and, individually, with all of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of thrash metal (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax).

Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, however, they were plagued by lineup changes: Vanderhoof ceased performing live with the group in 1986, to be replaced briefly by Mark Baker and more permanently by former Metallica roadie John Marshall. Vanderhoof nonetheless continued to work with the group in composing thereafter, co-writing much of their subsequent material. Wayne also departed shortly thereafter and was replaced by former Heretic singer Mike Howe. Wayne teamed up with the remaining members of Heretic to form Reverend.

===Further albums and first breakup (1989–1996)===
With Howe and Marshall, Metal Church released their third studio album, &quot;Blessing in Disguise&quot;, in 1989. Critics responded favorably to the album, including some assertions that it was the group&#x27;s strongest effort. &quot;Blessing in Disguise&quot; was even more successful than its predecessors, peaking at number 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; this was Metal Church&#x27;s highest chart position, until it was surpassed 27 years later by &quot;XI&quot;. The album&#x27;s success was attributed to the music video for &quot;Badlands&quot; getting airplay on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, and its opening track &quot;Fake Healer&quot; receiving some attention from mainstream radio stations, most notably KNAC and Z Rock; unlike &quot;Badlands&quot;, however, no there was no music video for &quot;Fake Healer&quot;. After spending much of 1989 and 1990 touring heavily behind &quot;Blessing in Disguise&quot; (performing with numerous bands such as Metallica, W.A.S.P., Accept, Annihilator, Saxon, Meliah Rage, Forced Entry and D.B.C.), the band had switched labels from Elektra to Epic.

Metal Church released its fourth studio album, and only album on Epic, &quot;The Human Factor&quot;, in 1991. Critics applauded the group for transitioning to a major label and successfully retaining the vitality of their sound, while also releasing a record with conceptual accessibility beyond the heavy metal genre. While &quot;The Human Factor&quot; failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it was supported by two successful North American tours, one of which saw Metal Church appear on the Operation Rock &amp; Roll tour (alongside Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, Motörhead and Dangerous Toys), and the band also supported Metallica on select dates of their Wherever We May Roam Tour.

The band followed with their fifth studio album, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Hanging in the Balance&quot;, on Mercury Records. After touring almost non-stop in support of that album for about two years, Metal Church officially disbanded for the first time in 1996, citing management problems and poor record sales as factors.

===Reunion of classic lineup and &quot;Masterpeace&quot; (1998–2001)===

The members of Metal Church began compiling their first live album in 1998, &quot;Live&quot;, which featured songs from their first two records performed by their classic lineup. During the production of &quot;Live&quot;, Wayne, Vanderhoof, Wells, Arrington, and Erickson decided to reform the band and began work on a new studio album. Wells was forced to depart the band due to familial obligations, however, and was replaced by the returning Marshall. The live album &quot;Live in Japan&quot; (recorded on the band&#x27;s 1995 Japanese tour) was also released in 1998, only in Japan.

The resulting album, &quot;Masterpeace&quot;, was released in 1999 on Nuclear Blast Records. Critics responded positively, hailing it as a focused product that increased the energy over previous releases, despite it ultimately failing to break new ground. Arrington and Erickson were unable to tour behind the album, so the band enlisted members of Vanderhoof&#x27;s side projects, bassist Brian Lake and drummer Jeff Wade, for live performances later that year.

Wayne expressed regret regarding &quot;Masterpeace&quot;, which influenced his musical output that followed. He departed from the band once again in June 2001, due to personal and creative differences, forming the group Wayne with Wells and releasing the curiously titled debut album &quot;Metal Church&quot; thereafter. Vanderhoof objected to the album&#x27;s name and cover art; according to Wayne, the purpose of the album&#x27;s name was to alert the audience of his involvement. Erickson and Marshall also ceased involvement with Metal Church after Wayne&#x27;s departure, leading to the band&#x27;s second hiatus.

===Munroe-led lineup, Wayne&#x27;s death, and second breakup (2002–2009)===
Vanderhoof&#x27;s eponymous band released &quot;A Blur in Time&quot; in 2002, and he began working on new material for Metal Church&#x27;s next album thereafter. In 2003, he and Arrington recruited singer Ronny Munroe, former Malice guitarist Jay Reynolds, and bassist Steve Unger to form a new lineup of Metal Church. The band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;The Weight of the World&quot;, was released in the following year. Critics generally reacted to the record with a lukewarm response, recognizing its accomplishments while noting its lack of consistency and innovation.

On May 10, 2005, former Metal Church singer David Wayne died of complications from injuries sustained in a car accident that occurred months before. He was 47 years old.

In 2006, Arrington left the band due to health complications with diabetes. His replacement was Jeff Plate, who previously played with Savatage, Chris Caffery and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Later that year, the band released their eighth studio album, &quot;A Light in the Dark&quot;, which featured a re-recording of &quot;Watch the Children Pray&quot; as a tribute to Wayne. Vanderhoof said that the tribute was a way of showing fans that he harbored no ill will towards Wayne despite the contentious situation that existed between them before his death.

Reynolds left the group in 2008 and was replaced by Rick Van Zandt. The band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;This Present Wasteland&quot;, released that September, which was hailed generally as an effective release consistent with their previous material. After subsequent touring, the band took a hiatus from performing due to Vanderhoof&#x27;s back problems. They nonetheless continued studio work, while Munroe and Vanderhoof also completed the former&#x27;s solo album.

After Vanderhoof&#x27;s health improved, they returned to performing and composing new material. On July 7, 2009, however, the group announced unexpectedly that they were disbanding following a final performance at Rocklahoma two days later, cancelling numerous further live dates. They cited industry frustrations as a major factor influencing the decision. Several former members remained musically active, including Munroe and Vanderhoof in Presto Ballet and Plate in Machines of Grace.

===Second reformation, &quot;Generation Nothing&quot; and rotating singers (2012–2015)===

In October 2012, the band announced resumption of activity around a lineup featuring Vanderhoof, Munroe, Unger, Reynolds (soon replaced by Van Zandt), and Plate. Their first performances came the following January during the 70,000 Tons of Metal event, a heavy metal cruise. During one of these two shows, the band performed their debut album, &quot;Metal Church&quot;, in its entirety. Shortly thereafter, Vanderhoof told Music Life Radio that Metal Church had been working on a new album. In order to promote their tenth studio album, the band played festivals in the summer of 2013. The album, &quot;Generation Nothing&quot;, was released in October.

Munroe left the band in September 2014 to &quot;pursue other interests&quot;. The band announced its plans to continue nonetheless. On April 30, 2015, Metal Church announced on their Facebook page that former singer Mike Howe had rejoined the band, nearly two decades after his first departure.

According to Howe, Metal Church was on the verge of disbanding once more before he agreed to rejoin the band. He explained to &quot;Spotlight Report&quot; in May 2016: &quot;Kurdt Vanderhoof got ahold of me in August of 2014, and he proposed [me] coming back to the band. He said Ronny [Munroe] left the band and he didn&#x27;t really wanna carry on with Metal Church unless maybe I would consider coming back. So I said, &#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m open to it. But let&#x27;s see what kind of music we can come up with.&#x27; So Kurdt went back to the studio and started writing songs in the vein of &quot;Hanging in the Balance&quot;, where we left off twenty years ago, and he sent them to me over the Internet. And I was, like, &#x27;Damn! The guy still has it and he&#x27;s doing great work.&#x27; So he sent me another batch, and that batch was just as good [as], if not better than, the other. So, from there, I said, &#x27;Well, I can&#x27;t say no to this. And let&#x27;s just see how it goes.&#x27; And we started writing lyrics and getting together, and it&#x27;s morphed into being back in Aberdeen in the studio making the new Metal Church record.&quot;

===&quot;XI&quot; and &quot;Damned If You Do&quot; (2016–2020)===
Metal Church released their eleventh studio album, &quot;XI&quot;, on March 25, 2016, and it was their first album with Howe on vocals since 1993&#x27;s &quot;Hanging in the Balance&quot;. Hailed by some critics as a comeback album, &quot;XI&quot; received positive reviews from critics, and was Metal Church&#x27;s first album in 27 years (since &quot;Blessing in Disguise&quot;) to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; the album peaked at number 57, making it the band&#x27;s highest chart position in their career. On the album&#x27;s supporting tour, guitarist Rick Van Zandt had to go in for emergency eye surgery to repair a detached retina, and was temporarily replaced by former Firewolfe guitarist Paul Kleff, and Savatage guitarist Chris Caffery. The band co-headlined a West Coast North American tour with Armored Saint in June 2016, and along with Amon Amarth, Suicidal Tendencies and Butcher Babies, they supported Megadeth on the latter&#x27;s U.S. &quot;Dystopia&quot; tour in September–October 2016.

When asked in October 2016 if he had intended write another album with Metal Church, Howe stated, &quot;We have every intention of doing that and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about. If you&#x27;re not putting on new music, then it&#x27;s time to go away for me. In Metal Church... it&#x27;s always been like a two-year cycle band, but we put our album out this year in March. So our album is actually only being out for six months. But we have plans on this fall getting back to writing and try to put something out next year. We&#x27;re also looking at some dates for the spring possibly back in the States and maybe back over here. But our drummer Jeff, he&#x27;s also on the TSO. He leaves from the end of October through December. So we might take that time to start writing new record.&quot;

Metal Church released a live album on April 28, 2017, titled &quot;Classic Live&quot;, which was recorded on the 2016 &quot;XI&quot; tour. This is the band&#x27;s first live album since 1998&#x27;s &quot;Live in Japan&quot;, and their first live album with Howe on vocals.

On March 21, 2017, drummer Jeff Plate announced his departure from Metal Church. As the result of his departure, the band withdrew from a North American tour with Alter Bridge and In Flames that was scheduled to take place in May 2017. Plate was replaced by former W.A.S.P. drummer Stet Howland.

In a May 2017 interview, Vanderhoof stated that Metal Church had begun writing and demoing their twelfth studio album, which was tentatively due for release in early 2018.

On October 1, 2018, Metal Church teased an audio sample of a song from their twelfth studio album. The album, &quot;Damned If You Do&quot;, was announced shortly after and it was released on December 7, 2018. In support of &quot;Damned If You Do&quot;, Metal Church co-headlined a North American tour with Doro in April–May 2019, and performed at Megadeth&#x27;s first-ever Megacruise that October.

In a July 2019 interview with Italy&#x27;s Metalforce, Howe said that Metal Church would likely begin writing new material in 2020. Vanderhoof stated in an interview with Metal Wani in April 2020 that Metal Church would &quot;probably start writing that later in the summer.&quot; He concluded, &quot;We&#x27;re gonna sit and we&#x27;re gonna wait till there&#x27;s a new album, and then we&#x27;ll go out and do the normal promoting it or backing it up by touring and playing shows. But we&#x27;re gonna wait till there&#x27;s a new record.&quot;

Metal Church released their first compilation album &quot;From the Vault&quot; on April 10, 2020. It contains four new studio tracks, five B-side tracks from the &quot;Damned If You Do&quot; sessions, three song covers and two tracks culled from their performance at Club Citta in Kawasaki, Japan. The band stated on their Facebook page in July 2021 that their thirteenth studio album would be released in 2022.

===Howe&#x27;s death, arrival of Marc Lopes, &quot;Congregation of Annihilation&quot; and next album (2021–present)===
On July 26, 2021, Metal Church announced Howe had died that morning at his home in Eureka, California, at the age of 55. His death was ruled to be a suicide by hanging. In October 2021, after announcing the return of his short-lived early 1990s band Hall Aflame, Vanderhoof hinted on his Facebook page that Metal Church would continue on with a yet-to-be-revealed replacement for Howe. A month later, drummer Stet Howland revealed that he and the remaining members of the band had started to &quot;communicate again&quot; following Howe&#x27;s death. Although he did not specify the current state of Metal Church, Howland declared, &quot;We&#x27;re all slowly digesting. We just started talking again a few weeks ago, and we&#x27;re barely talking about anything except making jokes, and we have our banter, we&#x27;re starting to joke and communicated again together. Building on the future will come, but right now... we&#x27;re just like hugging right now, we&#x27;re all like &#x27;I love you, man&#x27;. That&#x27;s kind of where we&#x27;re at. I know everybody wants to know more, when there&#x27;s more you&#x27;ll hear about it.&quot; By mid-2022, rumors had suggested that Ronny Munroe would rejoin the band, but resulted in him joining Vicious Rumors.

In a September 2022 interview with &quot;Metal Rules&quot;, Vanderhoof revealed that the band had found a replacement in Howe, but added that they were &quot;keeping a lid&quot; on the identity of their new singer &quot;for the time being.&quot; He also revealed that a new Metal Church album, which they had begun writing just before Howe&#x27;s death, would be released in 2023. The band played one of their first shows in four years at Belgium&#x27;s Alcatraz Open Air in August 2023.

On February 2, 2023, Metal Church announced Marc Lopes as their new lead vocalist. A month later, the band announced their thirteenth album, &quot;Congregation of Annihilation&quot;, would be released on May 26. Four days prior to the album&#x27;s release, former Metal Church drummer Kirk Arrington died at the age of 61. The band supported &quot;Congregation of Annihilation&quot; with a world tour, including a series of headlining tours in North America and Australia; Metal Church was scheduled to North America again in the spring of 2024, but it was cancelled because of Vanderhoof&#x27;s &quot;ongoing back issue.&quot; A live album featuring Howe&#x27;s final live performances, &quot;The Final Sermon (Live in Japan 2019)&quot;, was released on July 26, 2024 to coincide with the third anniversary of his death.

An authorized book by author James R. Beach and co-author and archivist Brian L. Naron, &quot;Beyond the Black: The Story of Metal Church&quot;, was released in November 2023. In addition to past and present members of Metal Church, the book includes interviews with the band&#x27;s road crew members, record producers and contemporaries, and a foreword by former Grim Reaper guitarist Nick Bowcott.

In a December 2023 interview with Metal Wani, Lopes stated that Metal Church would begin working on new material for their next album in late 2024.

When asked in January 2025 about the current status of Metal Church, Lopes said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know anything about nothing. It was doing amazing, everything was going really good, and then stuff happens. [Laughs] I haven&#x27;t heard from anybody in a long time. That happens. People sometimes, they&#x27;ve gotta go do their thing. So I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know. I have no idea… There&#x27;s nothing to hide. I don&#x27;t know anything. You know what I mean?&quot;

<text>Irbit () is a town in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia, located from Yekaterinburg by train or by car, on the right bank of the Nitsa. Population: 

It was previously known as &quot;Irbeyevskaya Sloboda&quot; (until 1662).

==History==
Founded in 1631 as Irbeyevskaya Sloboda (), its name was changed in 1662 to Irbit. It was granted official town status by Catherine the Great in 1775 for the town&#x27;s loyalty to the Empress during the Pugachev uprising of 1773–1774. In 1776, she awarded the town its official crest.

In the 19th century, the Irbit Fair was an important event for the trade in Siberian fur and Chinese tea.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of the administrative divisions, Irbit serves as the administrative center of Irbitsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the Town of Irbit—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the Town of Irbit is incorporated as Irbit Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
After World War II, various branches of industry, such as engineering, manufacturing of construction materials, pharmaceutical, light, and food-manufacturing industries developed rapidly. During the war a motorcycle-manufacturing plant was moved here from Moscow. For more than fifty years, over three million motorcycles had been produced here. The factory now produces only two thousand motorcycles a year, most of which are for export. In the Soviet times, however, hundreds of thousands were produced. Today it produces different types of motorcycles and spare parts for them, specializing in heavy motorcycles with sidecars. Irbit is also the former world headquarters for Russian motorcycle manufacturer Ural Motorcycles. In 2022, the Ural factory moved to Petropavlovsk, Kazakhstan.

Irbit dairy plant is the largest milk-processing plant in the Urals. In 2004, it processed 66,000 tons of milk. Irbit bakery plant manufactures different types of breads and batons, cakes, croutons, toasts. Irbit chemico-pharmaceutical plant produces drugs, chemical substances, fluids for chemical industry.

===Natural resources===
Water resources are represented by the Nitsa and Irbit Rivers. Mineral resources include diatomaceous earth and glass-making sand deposits.

===Transportation===
The town is crossed by the long distance railway Yekaterinburg–Tavda–Ustye-Akha and by road traffic routes, directed to Kamyshlov, Artyomovsk, Turinsk, and Tyumen.

==Culture==
The Irbit State Museum of Fine Art contains some important works including etchings by famous European artists. At the moment the museum is the only one in Russia specializing in engravings. In its collection there are engravings by Italian, Dutch, Flemish, German, French, English, Spanish, Swiss, Austrian, Polish, Bulgarian, Belgian, and North American artists. The collection includes works from Albrecht Dürer to Francisco Goya. Russian art is represented by the works of A. F. Zubova, I. A. Sokolova, E. P. Chemesova, Mikhail Dobuzhinsky, Alexander Deyneka, and many others. The domestic collection represents the artists of Yekaterinburg and Nizhny Tagil.

There is also a 200-year-old theater in the town.

Although Irbit no longer attracts as many visitors as it once did, the Irbit State Motorcycle Museum is being built in the town with the intention of bringing foreign motorcycle enthusiasts to the IMZ-Ural motorcycle factory. Each summer thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts come to Irbit from around the world to take part in the Irbit bike show and in the Motocross races.

A public park is located in the northern part of the town.

<text>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), rapid breathing (tachypnea), and bluish skin coloration (cyanosis). For those who survive, a decreased quality of life is common.
Causes may include sepsis, pancreatitis, trauma, pneumonia, and aspiration. The underlying mechanism involves diffuse injury to cells which form the barrier of the microscopic air sacs of the lungs, surfactant dysfunction, activation of the immune system, and dysfunction of the body&#x27;s regulation of blood clotting. In effect, ARDS impairs the lungs&#x27; ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. Adult diagnosis is based on a PaO2/FiO2 ratio (ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen) of less than 300 mm Hg despite a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of more than 5 cm H2O. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema, as the cause, must be excluded.
The primary treatment involves mechanical ventilation together with treatments directed at the underlying cause. Ventilation strategies include using low volumes and low pressures. If oxygenation remains insufficient, lung recruitment maneuvers and neuromuscular blockers may be used. If these are insufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be an option. The syndrome is associated with a death rate between 35 and 50%.
Globally, ARDS affects more than 3 million people a year. The condition was first described in 1967. Although the terminology of &quot;adult respiratory distress syndrome&quot; has at times been used to differentiate ARDS from &quot;infant respiratory distress syndrome&quot; in newborns, the international consensus is that &quot;acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot; is the best term because ARDS can affect people of all ages. There are separate diagnostic criteria for children and those in areas of the world with fewer resources.
==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of ARDS often begin within two hours of an inciting event, but have been known to take as long as 1–3 days; diagnostic criteria require a known insult to have happened within 7 days of the syndrome. Signs and symptoms may include shortness of breath, fast breathing, and a low oxygen level in the blood due to abnormal ventilation. Other common symptoms include muscle fatigue and general weakness, low blood pressure, a dry, hacking cough, and fever.

===Complications===
Complications may include the following:
* Lungs: barotrauma (volutrauma), pulmonary embolism (PE), pulmonary fibrosis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Gastrointestinal: bleeding (ulcer), dysmotility, pneumoperitoneum, bacterial translocation
* Neurological: hypoxic brain damage
* Cardiac: abnormal heart rhythms, myocardial dysfunction
* Kidney: acute kidney failure, positive fluid balance
* Mechanical: vascular injury, pneumothorax (by placing pulmonary artery catheter), tracheal injury/stenosis (result of intubation and/or irritation by endotracheal tube)
* Nutritional: malnutrition (catabolic state), electrolyte abnormalities

Other complications that are typically associated with ARDS include:
* Atelectasis: small air pockets within the lung collapse
* Complications that arise from treatment in a hospital: blood clots formed by lying down for long periods of time, weakness in muscles that are used for breathing, stress ulcers, and issues with mental health and depression.
* Failure of multiple organs
* Pulmonary hypertension or increase in blood pressure in the main artery from the heart to the lungs. This complication typically occurs due to the restriction of the blood vessel due to inflammation of the mechanical ventilation

==Causes==
There are &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot; causes of ARDS depending whether the lungs are initially affected. Direct causes include pneumonia (including bacterial and viral), aspiration, inhalational lung injury, lung contusion, chest trauma, and near-drowning. Indirect causes include sepsis, shock, pancreatitis, trauma (e.g. fat embolism), cardiopulmonary bypass, TRALI, burns, increased intracranial pressure. Fewer cases of ARDS are linked to large volumes of fluid used during post-trauma resuscitation.

==Pathophysiology==
ARDS is a form of fluid accumulation in the lungs not explained by heart failure (noncardiogenic pulmonary edema). It is typically provoked by an acute injury to the lungs that results in flooding of the lungs&#x27; microscopic air sacs responsible for the exchange of gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide with capillaries in the lungs. Additional common findings in ARDS include partial collapse of the alveoli (atelectasis) and low levels of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia). The clinical syndrome is associated with pathological findings including pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Of these, the pathology most commonly associated with ARDS is DAD, which is characterized by a diffuse inflammation of lung tissue. The triggering insult to the tissue usually results in an initial release of chemical signals and other inflammatory mediators secreted by local epithelial and endothelial cells.

Neutrophils and some T-lymphocytes quickly migrate into the inflamed lung tissue and contribute in the amplification of the phenomenon. The typical histological presentation involves diffuse alveolar damage and hyaline membrane formation in alveolar walls. Although the triggering mechanisms are not completely understood, recent research has examined the role of inflammation and mechanical stress.

One research group has reported that broncho-alveolar lavage fluid in later-stage ARDS often contains trichomonads, in an amoeboid form (i.e. lacking their characteristic flagellum) which makes them difficult to identify under the microscope.

==Diagnosis==
===Diagnostic criteria===
Diagnostic criteria for ARDS have changed over time as understanding of the pathophysiology has evolved. The international consensus criteria for ARDS were most recently updated in 2012 and are known as the &quot;Berlin definition&quot;. In addition to generally broadening the diagnostic thresholds, other notable changes from the prior 1994 consensus criteria include discouraging the term &quot;acute lung injury&quot;, and defining grades of ARDS severity according to degree of decrease in the oxygen content of the blood.

According to the 2012 Berlin definition, adult ARDS is characterized by the following: 
* lung injury of acute onset, within 1 week of an apparent clinical insult and with the progression of respiratory symptoms
* bilateral opacities on chest imaging (chest radiograph or CT) not explained by other lung pathology (e.g. effusion, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules)
* respiratory failure not explained by heart failure or volume overload
* decreased Pa/Fi ratio (a decreased Pa/Fi ratio indicates reduced arterial oxygenation from the available inhaled gas):
** &quot;mild ARDS&quot;: 201 – 300 mmHg (≤ 39.9 kPa)
** &quot;moderate ARDS&quot;: 101 – 200 mmHg (≤ 26.6 kPa)
** &quot;severe ARDS&quot;: ≤ 100 mmHg (≤ 13.3 kPa)
** The Berlin definition requires a minimum positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm for consideration of the Pa/Fi ratio. This degree of PEEP may be delivered noninvasively with CPAP to diagnose mild ARDS.

The 2012 &quot;Berlin criteria&quot; are a modification of the prior 1994 consensus conference definitions (see &quot;history&quot;).

=== Medical imaging ===
Radiologic imaging has long been a criterion for diagnosis of ARDS. Original definitions of ARDS specified that correlative chest X-ray findings were required for diagnosis, the diagnostic criteria have been expanded over time to accept CT and ultrasound findings as equally contributory. Generally, radiographic findings of fluid accumulation (pulmonary edema) affecting both lungs and unrelated to increased cardiopulmonary vascular pressure (such as in heart failure) may be suggestive of ARDS.
Ultrasound findings suggestive of ARDS include the following:
* Anterior subpleural consolidations
* Absence or reduction of lung sliding
* &quot;Spared areas&quot; of normal parenchyma
* Pleural line abnormalities (irregular thickened fragmented pleural line)
* Nonhomogeneous distribution of B-lines (a characteristic ultrasound finding suggestive of fluid accumulation in the lungs)

==Treatment==
Acute respiratory distress syndrome is usually treated with mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). Mechanical ventilation is usually delivered through a rigid tube which enters the oral cavity and is secured in the airway (endotracheal intubation), or by tracheostomy when prolonged ventilation (≥2 weeks) is necessary. The role of non-invasive ventilation is limited to the very early period of the disease or to prevent worsening respiratory distress in individuals with atypical pneumonias, lung bruising, or major surgery patients, who are at risk of developing ARDS. Treatment of the underlying cause is crucial. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is started as soon as culture results are available, or if infection is suspected (whichever is earlier). Empirical therapy may be appropriate if local microbiological surveillance is efficient. Where possible the origin of the infection is removed. When sepsis is diagnosed, appropriate local protocols are followed.

===Mechanical ventilation===
The overall goal of mechanical ventilation is to maintain acceptable gas exchange to meet the body&#x27;s metabolic demands and to minimize adverse effects in its application. The parameters PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure, to keep alveoli open), mean airway pressure (to promote recruitment (opening) of easily collapsible alveoli and predictor of hemodynamic effects), and plateau pressure (best predictor of alveolar overdistention) are used.

Previously, mechanical ventilation aimed to achieve tidal volumes (&quot;V&quot;t) of 12–15 ml/kg (where the weight is ideal body weight rather than actual weight). Recent studies have shown that high tidal volumes can overstretch alveoli resulting in volutrauma (secondary lung injury). The ARDS Clinical Network, or ARDSNet, completed a clinical trial that showed improved mortality when people with ARDS were ventilated with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg compared to the traditional 12 ml/kg. Low tidal volumes (&quot;V&quot;t) may cause a permitted rise in blood carbon dioxide levels and collapse of alveoli because of their inherent tendency to increase shunting within the lung. Physiologic dead space cannot change as it is ventilation without perfusion. A shunt is a perfusion without ventilation within a lung region.

Low tidal volume ventilation was the primary independent variable associated with reduced mortality in the NIH-sponsored ARDSNet trial of tidal volume in ARDS. Plateau pressure less than 30 cm was a secondary goal, and subsequent analyses of the data from the ARDSNet trial and other experimental data demonstrate that there appears to be no safe upper limit to plateau pressure; regardless of plateau pressure, individuals with ARDS fare better with low tidal volumes.

====Airway pressure release ventilation====
No particular ventilator mode is known to improve mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Some practitioners favor airway pressure release ventilation when treating ARDS. Well documented advantages to APRV ventilation include decreased airway pressures, decreased minute ventilation, decreased dead-space ventilation, promotion of spontaneous breathing, almost 24-hour-a-day alveolar recruitment, decreased use of sedation, near elimination of neuromuscular blockade, optimized arterial blood gas results, mechanical restoration of FRC (functional residual capacity), a positive effect on cardiac output (due to the negative inflection from the elevated baseline with each spontaneous breath), increased organ and tissue perfusion and potential for increased urine output secondary to increased kidney perfusion.

A patient with ARDS, on average, spends between 8 and 11 days on a mechanical ventilator; APRV may reduce this time significantly and thus may conserve valuable resources.

==== Positive end-expiratory pressure ====
Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used in mechanically ventilated people with ARDS to improve oxygenation. In ARDS, three populations of alveoli can be distinguished. There are normal alveoli that are always inflated and engaging in gas exchange, flooded alveoli which can never, under any ventilatory regime, be used for gas exchange, and atelectatic or partially flooded alveoli that can be &quot;recruited&quot; to participate in gas exchange under certain ventilatory regimens. The recruitable alveoli represent a continuous population, some of which can be recruited with minimal PEEP, and others can only be recruited with high levels of PEEP. An additional complication is that some alveoli can only be opened with higher airway pressures than are needed to keep them open, hence the justification for maneuvers where PEEP is increased to very high levels for seconds to minutes before dropping the PEEP to a lower level. PEEP can be harmful; high PEEP necessarily increases mean airway pressure and alveolar pressure, which can damage normal alveoli by overdistension resulting in DAD. A compromise between the beneficial and adverse effects of PEEP is inevitable.

The &#x27;best PEEP&#x27; used to be defined as &#x27;some&#x27; cm above the lower inflection point (LIP) in the sigmoidal pressure-volume relationship curve of the lung. Recent research has shown that the LIP-point pressure is no better than any pressure above it, as recruitment of collapsed alveoliand, more importantly, the overdistension of aerated unitsoccur throughout the whole inflation. Despite the awkwardness of most procedures used to trace the pressure-volume curve, it is still used by some to define the &quot;minimum&quot; PEEP to be applied to their patients. Some new ventilators can automatically plot a pressure-volume curve.

PEEP may also be set empirically. Some authors suggest performing a &#x27;recruiting maneuver&#x27;a short time at a very high continuous positive airway pressure, such as 50 cm (4.9 kPa)to recruit or open collapsed units with a high distending pressure before restoring previous ventilation. The final PEEP level should be the one just before the drop in Pa or peripheral blood oxygen saturation during a step-down trial. A large randomized controlled trial of patients with ARDS found that lung recruitment maneuvers and PEEP titration was associated with high rates of barotrauma and pneumothorax and increased mortality.

Intrinsic PEEP (iPEEP) or auto-PEEPfirst described by John Marini of St. Paul Regions Hospitalis a potentially unrecognized contributor to PEEP in intubated individuals. When ventilating at high frequencies, its contribution can be substantial, particularly in people with obstructive lung disease such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). iPEEP has been measured in very few formal studies on ventilation in ARDS, and its contribution is largely unknown. Its measurement is recommended in the treatment of people who have ARDS, especially when using high-frequency (oscillatory/jet) ventilation.

=== Prone position ===

The position of lung infiltrates in acute respiratory distress syndrome is non-uniform. Repositioning into the prone position (face down) might improve oxygenation by relieving atelectasis and improving perfusion. If this is done early in the treatment of severe ARDS, it confers a mortality benefit of 26% compared to supine ventilation. However, attention should be paid to avoid the SIDS in the management of the respiratory distressed infants by continuous careful monitoring of their cardiovascular system.

=== Fluid management ===
Several studies have shown that pulmonary function and outcome are better in people with ARDS who lost weight or whose pulmonary wedge pressure was lowered by diuresis or fluid restriction.

=== Medications ===
As of 2019, it is uncertain whether or not treatment with corticosteroids improves overall survival. Corticosteroids may increase the number of ventilator-free days during the first 28 days of hospitalization. One study found that dexamethasone may help. The combination of hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine also requires further study as of 2018.

Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) selectively widens the lung&#x27;s arteries which allows for more blood flow to open alveoli for gas exchange. Despite evidence of increased oxygenation status, there is no evidence that inhaled nitric oxide decreases morbidity and mortality in people with ARDS. Furthermore, nitric oxide may cause kidney damage and is not recommended as therapy for ARDS regardless of severity.

Alvelestat (AZD 9668) had been quoted according to one review article.

=== Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ===
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is mechanically applied prolonged cardiopulmonary support. There are two types of ECMO: Venovenous which provides respiratory support and venoarterial which provides respiratory and hemodynamic support. People with ARDS who do not require cardiac support typically undergo venovenous ECMO. Multiple studies have shown the effectiveness of ECMO in acute respiratory failure. Specifically, the CESAR (Conventional ventilatory support versus Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for Severe Acute Respiratory failure) trial demonstrated that a group referred to an ECMO center demonstrated significantly increased survival compared to conventional management (63% to 47%).

===Ineffective treatments===

As of 2019, there is no evidence showing that treatments with exogenous surfactants, statins, beta-blockers or n-acetylcysteine decreases early mortality, late all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or number of ventilator-free days.

== Prognosis ==
The overall prognosis of ARDS is poor, with mortality rates of approximately 40%. Exercise limitation, physical and psychological sequelae, decreased physical quality of life, and increased costs and use of health care services are important sequelae of ARDS.

==Epidemiology==

The annual rate of ARDS is generally 13–23 people per 100,000 in the general population. It is more common in people who are mechanically ventilated with acute lung injury (ALI) occurring in 16% of ventilated people. Rates increased in 2020 due to COVID-19, with some cases also appearing similar to HAPE.

Worldwide, severe sepsis is the most common trigger causing ARDS. Other triggers include mechanical ventilation, sepsis, pneumonia, Gilchrist&#x27;s disease, drowning, circulatory shock, aspiration, traumaespecially pulmonary contusionmajor surgery, massive blood transfusions, smoke inhalation, drug reaction or overdose, fat emboli and reperfusion pulmonary edema after lung transplantation or pulmonary embolectomy. However, the majority of patients with all these conditions mentioned do not develop ARDS. It is unclear why some people with the mentioned factors above do not develop ARDS and others do.

Pneumonia and sepsis are the most common triggers, and pneumonia is present in up to 60% of patients and may be either causes or complications of ARDS. Alcohol excess appears to increase the risk of ARDS. Diabetes was originally thought to decrease the risk of ARDS, but this has shown to be due to an increase in the risk of pulmonary edema. Elevated abdominal pressure of any cause is also probably a risk factor for the development of ARDS, particularly during mechanical ventilation.

==History==
Acute respiratory distress syndrome was first described in 1967 by Ashbaugh &quot;et al.&quot; Initially there was no clearly established definition, which resulted in controversy regarding the incidence and death of ARDS.

In 1988, an expanded definition was proposed, which quantified physiologic respiratory impairment.

=== 1994 American-European Consensus Conference ===

In 1994, a new definition was recommended by the American-European Consensus Conference Committee which recognized the variability in severity of pulmonary injury.

The definition required the following criteria to be met:
* acute onset, persistent dyspnea
* bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph consistent with pulmonary edema
* hypoxemia, defined as Pa:Fi &lt; 200 mmHg (26.7 kPa)
* absence of left atrial (LA) hypertension
** pulmonary artery wedge pressure &lt; 18 mmHg (obtained by pulmonary artery catheterization)
** if no measured LA pressure available, there must be no other clinical evidence to suggest elevated left heart pressure.

If Pa:Fi &lt; 300 mmHg (40 kPa), then the definitions recommended a classification as &quot;acute lung injury&quot; (ALI). Note that according to these criteria, arterial blood gas analysis and chest X-ray were required for formal diagnosis. Limitations of these definitions include lack of precise definition of acuity, nonspecific imaging criteria, lack of precise definition of hypoxemia with regards to PEEP (affects arterial oxygen partial pressure), arbitrary Pa thresholds without systematic data.

=== 2012 Berlin definition ===
In 2012, the Berlin Definition of ARDS was devised by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, and was endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and the Society of Critical Care Medicine. These recommendations were an effort to both update classification criteria in order to improve clinical usefulness and to clarify terminology. Notably, the Berlin guidelines discourage the use of the term &quot;acute lung injury&quot; or ALI, as the term was commonly being misused to characterize a less severe degree of lung injury. Instead, the committee proposes a classification of ARDS severity as mild, moderate, or severe according to arterial oxygen saturation. The Berlin definitions represent the current international consensus guidelines for both clinical and research classification of ARDS.

==Terminology==
ARDS is the severe form of acute lung injury (ALI), and of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), though there are other causes. The Berlin definition included ALI as a mild form of ARDS. However, the criteria for the diagnosis of ARDS in the Berlin definition excludes many children, and a new definition for children was termed &quot;pediatric&quot; acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS); this is known as the PALICC definition (2015).

== Research directions ==
There is ongoing research on the treatment of ARDS by interferon (IFN) beta-1a to aid in preventing leakage of vascular beds. Traumakine (FP-1201-lyo) is a recombinant human IFN beta-1a drug, developed by the Finnish company Faron Pharmaceuticals, which is undergoing international phase-III clinical trials after an open-label, early-phase trial showed an 81% reduction-in-odds of 28-day mortality in ICU patients with ARDS. The drug is known to function by enhancing lung CD73 expression and increasing production of anti-inflammatory adenosine, such that vascular leaking and escalation of inflammation are reduced.

Aspirin has been studied in those who are at high risk and was not found to be useful.

An intravenous ascorbic acid treatment was tested in the 2019 RCT, in people with ARDS due to sepsis and there was no change in primary endpoints.

<doc id="482447" wikidata="Q2408034" url="?curid=482447" title="New Reform Party of Ontario">
<text>The New Reform Party of Ontario (NRP; ) was a minor provincial political party in Ontario, Canada, that promoted a populist, fiscally conservative, socially conservative, libertarian, and localist ideology.

It was formed in Hamilton in 1987 as the Family Coalition Party of Ontario (FCP) through 11,000 signatures fulfilling the Elections Ontario requirements by members from the Liberals for Life (a splinter group of the Liberal Party of Canada) and members of the anti-abortion organization Campaign Life Coalition. It has fielded candidates in every provincial election since then. None of its candidates were ever elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

In late 2015, the FCP renamed itself the &quot;New Reform Party of Ontario&quot;, which maintained the party&#x27;s conservative social values, while also promoting conservative fiscal values. It began to overhaul its principles, policies, and platform, reorganizing the central office, and aiming to reestablish is provincial executive council regionally in time for the next provincial election in Fall 2018.

The last leader of the NRP was James Gault and provincial party president was Lynne Scime.

The party was deregistered by Elections Ontario in January 2016.

==History==
The FCP was founded in 1987, as a political extension of the anti-abortion organization Campaign Life Coalition with anti-abortion Liberal members from the splinter group Liberals for Life. Donald Pennell, who had previously been a candidate for the Ontario Liberal Party in the Burlington South riding during the 1975 provincial election, was chosen as the FCP&#x27;s first leader. In addition to promoting an anti-abortion position, the party developed a platform opposed to divorce, euthanasia, same-sex marriage and adoption of children by same-sex couples, embryonic stem cell research, in vitro fertilization, pornography, and contraception.

The party&#x27;s first election was the 1987 provincial election, where the party ran 36 candidates for 48,110 votes overall and 1.3% of the vote in only four weeks of existence to organize for a fourth place showing ahead of the Libertarians. This solid performance from the upstart party led to expansion into new ridings with bigger membership base. The party&#x27;s strongest showing was in the 1990 provincial election, when it received over 100,000 votes, once again good enough for a fourth place showing ahead of the Confederation of Regions Party. In 1990, several candidates received over 10% of the popular vote (the best was 13%). The party ran 76 candidates.

Its strong support declined dramatically in the 1995 and 1999 elections with fourth placings ahead of Natural Law, followed by a modest recovery in 2003 when the FCP ran in 51 of 103 ridings, but dropped from fourth to fifth place just below the Greens. The minor breakthrough was made, according to FCP leader Giuseppe Gori, through the democratization of the internet beyond the mainstream media and hope for a form of proportional representation ballot electoral reform. The party nominated 83 candidates in the 107 ridings for the 2007 provincial election; in those 83 ridings, it obtained 1.045% of the votes, or 0.82% province-wide. The FCP stayed in fifth place, under the Greens, but above the other minor parties.

The loss of traction in 1995 was blamed on the true blue wave of the Common Sense Revolution by the Mike Harris led Ontario PCs, taking with it a large swatch of anti-abortion socially conservative constituency from the traditional FCP base of support via the &quot;Mulroney Effect&quot; as was coined by the Campaign Life Coalition.

Pennell was succeeded by Giuseppe Gori in 1997, who lead the party into the 1999 election. The party achieved limited media attention by conducting a demonstration at Queen&#x27;s Park featuring three &quot;cloned sheep&quot; to represent Progressive Conservative leader Mike Harris, Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty and New Democratic Party leader Howard Hampton. The FCP&#x27;s intent was both to indicate their opposition to cloning technology, and to suggest that the major parties were identical in ignoring family issues, using the slogan &quot;Liberal, Tory, NDP same old status quo story&quot;.

The FCP supported the 2007 electoral reform referendum for a mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) hybrid voting system.

The FCP set, according to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, a record for the number of family members running as candidates in a single election in 2007. Eight members of the Kidd family and six members of the Carvalho family are running as candidates in the Greater Toronto Area. The newspaper could not find a Guinness Book record for such a feat.

The party nominated 31 candidates in the 107 ridings for the 2007 provincial election; in those 31 ridings, it obtained 0.23% of the votes province-wide. The FCP dropped to sixth place as the Greens and Libertarians surpassed. Gori stepped down in 2009, and Phil Lees was acclaimed leader.

After the 2011 provincial election, the FCP worked on local advocacy campaigns within various communities around the province, most notably involving the challenge of Bill 13, the anti-bullying legislation introduced by the Ontario Liberal government. Lees was a speaker at two Queen&#x27;s Park Bill 13 protest rallies in early 2012. Education soon became the prime issue for the FCP. The FCP stated in early 2014 that it intends to become more active and visible between elections, to better represent what it calls the &quot;traditional-principled&quot; electorate in Ontario, which led it to move closer towards a grassroots participatory democratic political ideology.

After the 2014 election, the Reform Party of Ontario had been deregistered by Elections Ontario for failing to run candidates, and the FCP had finished poorly with its worst showing in a distant seventh place, running only six candidates in 2014 for 0.09% of the votes province-wide for the former fourth party just more than a quarter century previous. The party voted to change its name to the New Reform Party of Ontario (NRP) in a December 2014 membership vote and began the process to overhaul its principles, policies, and platform, reorganizing the central office, and reestablishing provincial executive council regionally in time for the next provincial election. In 2015, Gault stood in the Simcoe North byelection against newly chosen Progressive Conservative leader Patrick Brown; Gault placed fifth out of eight candidates, with 197 votes and 0.50%. The party was deregistered in 2016, shortly after Gault filed to run in the Whitby—Oshawa by-election; Gault was formally included as an independent, though he continued to promote the party. He later withdrew from the race and endorsed Greg Vezina of the None of the Above Party of Ontario, which he stated shared the NRP&#x27;s &quot;3Rs of Democracy&quot; idea of responsible government, referendum, and recall.

===Relationship with the Christian Heritage Party===
The NRP&#x27;s membership overlapped significantly with that of the federal Christian Heritage Party of Canada. The parties shared many socially conservative policies, but had no organizational connection.

==Ideology==
New Reform Ontario&#x27;s principles remained the same as they were with the FCP, which include respect for life, freedom, and ownership of property. The NRP &quot;adheres to principles expressed in the Canadian Constitution that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law, natural law and just human law. The New Reform Party believes in the democratic principle of subsidiarity: Government is an institution created by people, while people’s fundamental rights are inherent in every human being as each one is created by the Creator God. The role of government is restricted to what individuals and private organizations cannot do by themselves. The New Reform Party is committed to restricting its own policies and rule accordingly, were it elected to govern.&quot; The NRP believed all people are equal and should be treated as such under the law.

On familial issues, they emphasized &quot;the family, rather than the individual&quot; as the &quot;basic building block of our society&quot;, and asserted that the promotion of stronger family units will result in reduced social problems and a more robust workforce. On marriage issues, the party emphasised the family unit, favouring heterosexual married couples, as it opposed spousal benefits for same-sex couples and common-law heterosexual couples. The NRP supported increasing personal and spousal tax exemption, and providing assistance to single mothers who choose to carry a pregnancy to term. It also recognized &quot;the work of mothers in the nurturing of children&quot;, and supported increased tax benefits for stay-at-home parents. The party opposed Sunday shopping and supported a housing and taxation policy beneficial to family. On human life issues, the party supported an end to the taxpayer funding and support of abortion by the government, and the &quot;harvesting&quot; and production of &quot;spare parts&quot; by keeping anencephalic babies alive. On education issues, they supported funding of all schools, not just the public and Catholic systems favouring options for families to choose the form of education that best suits their values and needs, and the protection of parental values in the school setting.

The party&#x27;s &quot;Contract with Ontario&quot;, after the 2007 election, incorporated 12 points: &quot;We will not breach your trust and we will uphold the truth; we will govern according to moral principles, defending life, freedom and property; we believe in the value and dignity of the human person over and above material goods, ideologies and corporate entities; we will defend the traditional family as the first government where children are educated in knowledge, wisdom and responsibility; we believe any government above the family is delegated and must be chosen through fair and democratic elections; we will maintain an optimum amount of government and avoid government duplication of what individuals, families, associations, groups and businesses can do; we believe an optimum amount of government can greatly improve the economic environment and thus, the standard of living, employment levels, and wealth creation; we believe people have free will and are called to exercise it; we believe people are dignified by employment; we believe people fully develop their potential by self-employment; we believe competition and high standards drive excellence; we do not believe in government or corporate monopolies.&quot;

The New Reform Ontario&#x27;s ideals on various matters were generally traditional, being fiscal, economic, social, libertarian reformed conservative in tone, although not universally so. For one example, the NRP opposed the privatization and firesale of Hydro One by the Wynne Ontario Liberal government to pay down the debt and balance the budget, as it had no mandate from its recent majority election having not run on the idea and is just a &quot;quick cash grab to pay short term projects and past financial mistakes&quot; which run counter to free market economics. New Reform Ontario supported a reduction in the size of government, and &quot;the long-term removal of all measures that insulate industries, businesses, financial institutions, professions and trade unions from domestic and foreign competition&quot;. The NRP believed that the limited government has a reduced role to play in issues relating to environmental, educational, and health care management, and ensuring access to health services regardless of ability to pay.

<text>Baron Sheffield is a title that has been created four times: once in the Peerage of England, twice in the Peerage of Ireland, and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The first creation, as &quot;Baron Sheffield of Butterwick&quot;, was in the Peerage of England in 1547 for Edmund Sheffield (1521–1549), second cousin of Henry VIII, who was murdered in Norwich during Kett&#x27;s Rebellion. His grandson, the 
3rd Baron Sheffield, was created &quot;Earl of Mulgrave&quot; in 1626, and the 3rd Earl of Mulgrave was finally advanced to the &quot;dukedom of Buckingham and Normanby&quot;. In 1735, at the death of the 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, however, all of the titles became extinct since no heirs to them remained.

The next three creations were all in favour of one person, John Baker-Holroyd (1735–1821). In 1781, on the second creation of the title, he was made &quot;Baron Sheffield, of Dunnamore in the County of Meath&quot; in the Peerage of Ireland. This peerage was created with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. Two years later, in 1783, John Baker-Holroyd obtained the third creation of the title when he was made &quot;Baron Sheffield, of Roscommon in the County of Roscommon&quot;, also in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder, failing heirs male of his body, to the heirs male of his daughters from his first marriage. On the fourth creation of a Sheffield barony in 1802, John Baker-Holroyd was created &quot;Baron Sheffield, of Sheffield in the County of York,&quot; in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1816 the same John Baker-Holroyd was further made &quot;Earl of Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Viscount Pevensey&quot; in the Peerage of Ireland. The latter titles were all created with remainder to the heirs male of his body. He was succeeded by his son from his second marriage.

On the death in 1909 of the 3rd Earl of Sheffield, his earldom, the Pevensey viscountcy and the Sheffield baronies of 1781 and 1802 became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the Sheffield barony of 1783 according to special remainder by Edward Stanley, 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley, who was also 3rd Baron Eddisbury and now became 4th Baron Sheffield as well. The 4th Baron Sheffield was the grandson of Lady Maria Josepha Holroyd, daughter of the 1st Earl of Sheffield. These titles remain extant and united, see Baron Stanley of Alderley for further succession.

<text>Baron Stanley of Alderley, in the County of Chester, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1839 for the politician and landowner Sir John Stanley, 7th Baronet. 

== History ==

When the 1st Baron died in 1850, he was succeeded as 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley and 8th Baronet of Alderley Hall by his son Edward, who was a prominent Liberal politician and notably served as President of the Board of Trade, Postmaster General and had in 1848 been created Baron Eddisbury, of Winnington in the County Palatine of Chester, in his own right. His wife Henrietta was a prominent campaigner for women&#x27;s education. After his death, the Stanley of Alderley and Eddisbury baronies remained united; most holders have since chosen to be known as &quot;Lord Stanley of Alderley&quot;. The 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley had a career in the Diplomatic Service; as he was childless he was succeeded by his younger brother, the 4th Baron. He was liberal member of parliament for Oldham. In 1909, the 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley acquired a further title when he succeeded his first cousin once removed, the Earl of Sheffield, according to a special remainder and thus inherited the title of 4th Baron Sheffield. After his death the titles passed to his son, the 5th Baron Stanley of Alderley. He was Liberal Member of Parliament for Eddisbury and also served as Governor of Victoria. His eldest son, the 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley, sold the family seat of Alderley Hall in 1938. He was married four times, the second time to Sylvia Ashley. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother, who preferred to be known as Lord Sheffield. He only held the titles for three months. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s cousin, the 9th Baron Stanley of Alderley, who succeeded his father in that year. He is the grandson of Oliver Hugh Stanley, youngest son of the 4th Baron.

The Stanley baronetcy, of Alderley Hall in the County of Chester, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1660 for the barrister Thomas Stanley. He was a descendant of Sir John Stanley, third son of Thomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley (whose eldest son was created Earl of Derby in 1485). He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He was High Sheriff of Cheshire in 1678. His great-grandson, the sixth Baronet, was a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber. His eldest son was the seventh Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage in 1839. See above for further succession.

The Right Reverend Edward Stanley, second son of the sixth Baronet, was Bishop of Norwich. Venetia Stanley was the youngest daughter of the fourth Baron.

The traditional burial place of the Lords Stanley of Alderley was the Stanley Mausoleum in the churchyard of St Mary, Nether Alderley, Cheshire, built in 1909. The building now belongs to the parish council. The London house of the Stanley family at 40 Dover Street was purchased by The Arts Club, a club for gentlemen interested in the arts, in 1896. It remains there to this day.

The family seat now is Rectory Farm, near Stanton St. John, Oxfordshire.

<text>Baron Eddisbury, of Winnington in the County Palatine of Chester, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 12 May 1848 for the Whig politician and diplomat Edward Stanley (1802–1869), son of the politician Sir John Stanley, 7th Baronet.

Edward Stanley started his career in 1831 as Whig member of the House of Commons before holding various cabinet posts under Prime Ministers Lord Melbourne, Lord Russell and Lord Palmerston. He became a member of the Privy Council in 1841, was created &quot;Baron Eddisbury&quot; in 1848 and served as Postmaster-General from 1860 to 1866.

In 1839, Lord Eddisbury&#x27;s father Sir John Stanley, 7th Baronet, had been raised to the peerage as &quot;Baron Stanley of Alderley&quot;. Upon his death in 1850, his barony and the Stanley Baronetcy passed to Lord Eddisbury, who thereby became 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley and 8th Baronet of Alderley Hall. These titles have remained united since; most holders have chosen to be known as &quot;Lord Stanley of Alderley&quot;. In 1909, Edward Stanley, the 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley and 3rd Baron Eddisbury, acquired a further title for the Stanley family when he succeeded his first cousin once removed, the 3rd Earl of Sheffield, according to a special remainder and thus inherited the title of 4th &quot;Baron Sheffield&quot;.

==Barons Eddisbury (1848)==
*Edward John Stanley, 1st Baron Eddisbury, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley (1802–1869)
*Henry Edward John Stanley, 2nd Baron Eddisbury, 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley (1827–1903)
*Edward Lyulph Stanley, 3rd Baron Eddisbury, 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley, 4th Baron Sheffield (1839–1925) (known as Lord Stanley of Alderley)
*Arthur Lyulph Stanley, 4th Baron Eddisbury, 5th Baron Stanley of Alderley, 5th Baron Sheffield (1875–1931) (known as Lord Sheffield)
*Edward John Stanley, 5th Baron Eddisbury, 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley, 6th Baron Sheffield (1907–1971) (known as Lord Stanley of Alderley)
*Lyulph Henry Victor Owen Stanley, 6th Baron Eddisbury, 7th Baron Stanley of Alderley, 7th Baron Sheffield (1915–1971) (known as Lord Sheffield)
*Thomas Henry Oliver Stanley, 7th Baron Eddisbury, 8th Baron Stanley of Alderley, 8th Baron Sheffield (1927–2013) (known as Lord Stanley of Alderley)
*Richard Oliver Stanley, 8th Baron Eddisbury, 9th Baron Stanley of Alderley, 9th Baron Sheffield (b. 1956)

The heir presumptive is the present holder&#x27;s brother Hon. Charles Ernest Stanley (b. 1960).

<doc id="482469" wikidata="Q3699481" url="?curid=482469" title="Shielding effect">
<text>In chemistry, the shielding effect sometimes referred to as atomic shielding or 
electron shielding describes the attraction between an electron and the nucleus in any atom with more than one electron. The shielding effect can be defined as a reduction in the effective nuclear charge on the electron cloud, due
to a difference in the attraction forces on the electrons in the atom. It is a special case of electric-field screening.
This effect also has some significance in many projects in material sciences.

==Strength per electron shell or orbital==

The wider the electron shells are in space, the weaker is the electric interaction between the electrons and the nucleus due to screening. Further, because of differences in orbital penetration, we can order the screening strength, &quot;S&quot;, that electrons in a given orbital (s, p, d, or f) provide to the rest of the electrons thus:
formula_1

==Description==

In hydrogen, or any other atom in group 1A of the periodic table (those with only one valence electron), the force on the electron is just as large as the electromagnetic attraction from the nucleus of the atom. However, when more electrons are involved, each electron (in the &quot;n&quot;th-shell) experiences not only the electromagnetic attraction from the positive nucleus, but also repulsion forces from other electrons in shells from 1 to &quot;n&quot;. This causes the net force on electrons in outer shells to be significantly smaller in magnitude; therefore, these electrons are not as strongly bonded to the nucleus as electrons closer to the nucleus. This phenomenon is often referred to as the orbital penetration effect. The shielding theory also contributes to the explanation of why valence-shell electrons are more easily removed from the atom.

Additionally, there is also a shielding effect that occurs between sublevels within the same principal energy level. An electron in the s-sublevel is capable of shielding electrons in the p-sublevel of the same principal energy level.

The size of the shielding effect is difficult to calculate precisely due to effects from quantum mechanics. As an approximation, we can estimate the effective nuclear charge on each electron by the following:

:formula_2

Where &quot;Z&quot; is the number of protons in the nucleus and formula_3 is the average number of electrons between the nucleus and the electron in question. formula_3can be found by using quantum chemistry and the Schrödinger equation, or by using Slater&#x27;s empirical formulas.

In Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, the correction due to electron screening modifies the Coulomb repulsion between the incident ion and the target nucleus at large distances. It is the repulsion effect caused by the inner electron on the outer electron.

<doc id="482471" wikidata="Q1238449" url="?curid=482471" title="Polylogarithm">
<text>In mathematics, the polylogarithm (also known as Jonquière&#x27;s function, for Alfred Jonquière) is a special function of order and argument . Only for special values of does the polylogarithm reduce to an elementary function such as the natural logarithm or a rational function. In quantum statistics, the polylogarithm function appears as the closed form of integrals of the Fermi–Dirac distribution and the Bose–Einstein distribution, and is also known as the Fermi–Dirac integral or the Bose–Einstein integral. In quantum electrodynamics, polylogarithms of positive integer order arise in the calculation of processes represented by higher-order Feynman diagrams.

The polylogarithm function is equivalent to the Hurwitz zeta function — either function can be expressed in terms of the other — and both functions are special cases of the Lerch transcendent. Polylogarithms should not be confused with polylogarithmic functions, nor with the offset logarithmic integral , which has the same notation without the subscript.
The polylogarithm function is defined by a power series in , which is also a Dirichlet series in :
formula_1

This definition is valid for arbitrary complex order and for all complex arguments with ; it can be extended to by the process of analytic continuation. (Here the denominator is understood as ). The special case involves the ordinary natural logarithm, , while the special cases and are called the dilogarithm (also referred to as Spence&#x27;s function) and trilogarithm respectively. The name of the function comes from the fact that it may also be defined as the repeated integral of itself:
formula_2
thus the dilogarithm is an integral of a function involving the logarithm, and so on. For nonpositive integer orders , the polylogarithm is a rational function.

==Properties==
In the case where the order formula_3 is an integer, it will be represented by formula_4 (or formula_5 when negative). It is often convenient to define formula_6 where formula_7 is the principal branch of the complex logarithm formula_8 so that formula_9 Also, all exponentiation will be assumed to be single-valued: formula_10

Depending on the order formula_3, the polylogarithm may be multi-valued. The &quot;principal branch&quot; of formula_12 is taken to be given for formula_13 by the above series definition and taken to be continuous except on the positive real axis, where a cut is made from formula_14 to formula_15 such that the axis is placed on the lower half plane of In terms of this amounts to formula_16. The discontinuity of the polylogarithm in dependence on formula_17 can sometimes be confusing.

For real argument formula_18, the polylogarithm of real order formula_3 is real if and its imaginary part for formula_20 is :

formula_21

Going across the cut, if &quot;ε&quot; is an infinitesimally small positive real number, then:

formula_22

Both can be concluded from the series expansion (see below) of about 

The derivatives of the polylogarithm follow from the defining power series:

formula_23
formula_24

The square relationship is seen from the series definition, and is related to the duplication formula (see also , ):

formula_25

Kummer&#x27;s function obeys a very similar duplication formula. This is a special case of the multiplication formula, for any positive integer &quot;p&quot;:

formula_26

which can be proved using the series definition of the polylogarithm and the orthogonality of the exponential terms (see e.g. discrete Fourier transform).

Another important property, the inversion formula, involves the Hurwitz zeta function or the Bernoulli polynomials and is found under relationship to other functions below.

==Particular values==
For particular cases, the polylogarithm may be expressed in terms of other functions (see below). Particular values for the polylogarithm may thus also be found as particular values of these other functions.

==Relationship to other functions==

* For , the polylogarithm reduces to the Riemann zeta function formula_27
* The polylogarithm is related to Dirichlet eta function and the Dirichlet beta function: formula_28 where is the Dirichlet eta function. For pure imaginary arguments, we have: formula_29 where is the Dirichlet beta function.
* The polylogarithm is related to the complete Fermi–Dirac integral as: formula_30
* The polylogarithm is related to the complete Bose–Einstein integral as: formula_31
* The polylogarithm is a special case of the incomplete polylogarithm function formula_32
* The polylogarithm is a special case of the Lerch transcendent formula_33
* The polylogarithm is related to the Hurwitz zeta function by: formula_34 which relation, however, is invalidated at positive integer &quot;s&quot; by poles of the gamma function , and at by a pole of both zeta functions; a derivation of this formula is given under series representations below. With a little help from a functional equation for the Hurwitz zeta function, the polylogarithm is consequently also related to that function via : formula_35 which relation holds for if , and for if . Equivalently, for all complex &quot;s&quot; and for complex , the inversion formula reads formula_36 and for all complex &quot;s&quot; and for complex formula_37 For , one has , and both expressions agree. These relations furnish the analytic continuation of the polylogarithm beyond the circle of convergence |&quot;z&quot;| = 1 of the defining power series. (The corresponding equation of and is not correct if one assumes that the principal branches of the polylogarithm and the logarithm are used simultaneously.) See the next item for a simplified formula when &quot;s&quot; is an integer.
* For positive integer polylogarithm orders &quot;s&quot;, the Hurwitz zeta function ζ(1−&quot;s&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) reduces to Bernoulli polynomials, , and Jonquière&#x27;s inversion formula for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, … becomes: formula_38 where again 0 ≤ Re(&quot;x&quot;) &lt; 1 if Im(&quot;x&quot;) ≥ 0, and 0 &lt; Re(&quot;x&quot;) ≤ 1 if Im(&quot;x&quot;) &lt; 0. Upon restriction of the polylogarithm argument to the unit circle, Im(&quot;x&quot;) = 0, the left hand side of this formula simplifies to 2 Re(Li&quot;n&quot;(&quot;e&quot;2&quot;πix&quot;)) if &quot;n&quot; is even, and to 2&quot;i&quot; Im(Li&quot;n&quot;(&quot;e&quot;2&quot;πix&quot;)) if &quot;n&quot; is odd. For negative integer orders, on the other hand, the divergence of Γ(&quot;s&quot;) implies for all &quot;z&quot; that : formula_39 More generally, one has for : formula_40 where both expressions agree for . (The corresponding equation of and is again not correct.)
* The polylogarithm with pure imaginary &quot;μ&quot; may be expressed in terms of the Clausen functions &quot;Ci&quot;&quot;s&quot;(θ) and &quot;Si&quot;&quot;s&quot;(θ), and vice versa (; ):formula_41
* The inverse tangent integral can be expressed in terms of polylogarithms: formula_42 The relation in particular implies: formula_43 which explains the function name.
* The Legendre chi function &quot;χ&quot;&quot;s&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) (; ) can be expressed in terms of polylogarithms: formula_44
* The polylogarithm of integer order can be expressed as a generalized hypergeometric function: formula_45
* In terms of the incomplete zeta functions or &quot;Debye functions&quot; : formula_46 the polylogarithm Li&quot;n&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) for positive integer n may be expressed as the finite sum : formula_47 A remarkably similar expression relates the &quot;Debye functions&quot; &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) to the polylogarithm: formula_48
* Using Lambert series, if formula_49 is Jordan&#x27;s totient function, then formula_50

==Integral representations==
Any of the following integral representations furnishes the analytic continuation of the polylogarithm beyond the circle of convergence |&quot;z&quot;| = 1 of the defining power series.
==Series representations==
==Asymptotic expansions==
For |&quot;z&quot;| ≫ 1, the polylogarithm can be expanded into asymptotic series in terms of ln(−&quot;z&quot;):

formula_51
formula_52

where &quot;B&quot;2&quot;k&quot; are the Bernoulli numbers. Both versions hold for all &quot;s&quot; and for any arg(&quot;z&quot;). As usual, the summation should be terminated when the terms start growing in magnitude. For negative integer &quot;s&quot;, the expansions vanish entirely; for non-negative integer &quot;s&quot;, they break off after a finite number of terms. describes a method for obtaining these series from the Bose–Einstein integral representation (his equation 11.2 for Li&quot;s&quot;(&quot;e&quot;&quot;μ&quot;) requires −2&quot;π&quot; &lt; Im(&quot;μ&quot;) ≤ 0).

==Limiting behavior==

The following limits result from the various representations of the polylogarithm :

formula_53 denotes the golden ratio.

==Polylogarithm ladders==

Leonard Lewin discovered a remarkable and broad generalization of a number of classical relationships on the polylogarithm for special values. These are now called &quot;polylogarithm ladders&quot;. Define formula_54 as the reciprocal of the golden ratio. Then two simple examples of dilogarithm ladders are

formula_55

given by and

formula_56

given by Landen. Polylogarithm ladders occur naturally and deeply in K-theory and algebraic geometry. Polylogarithm ladders provide the basis for the rapid computations of various mathematical constants by means of the BBP algorithm .

==Monodromy==
The polylogarithm has two branch points; one at &quot;z&quot; = 1 and another at &quot;z&quot; = 0. The second branch point, at &quot;z&quot; = 0, is not visible on the main sheet of the polylogarithm; it becomes visible only when the function is analytically continued to its other sheets. The monodromy group for the polylogarithm consists of the homotopy classes of loops that wind around the two branch points. Denoting these two by &quot;m&quot;0 and &quot;m&quot;1, the monodromy group has the group presentation

formula_57

For the special case of the dilogarithm, one also has that &quot;wm&quot;0 = &quot;m&quot;0&quot;w&quot;, and the monodromy group becomes the Heisenberg group (identifying &quot;m&quot;0, &quot;m&quot;1 and &quot;w&quot; with &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) .

<text>The Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) is an American progressive think tank, formed in 1963 and based in Washington, D.C. It was directed by John Cavanagh from 1998 to 2021. In 2021, Tope Folarin assumed the position of executive director. IPS focuses on US foreign policy, domestic policy, human rights, international economics, and national security.

IPS has been described as one of the five major independent think tanks in Washington during its first decades. Members of the IPS played key roles in the civil rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s, in the women&#x27;s and environmental movements of the 1970s, and in the peace, anti-apartheid, and anti-intervention movements of the 1980s.

== History ==
The IPS has come to be seen as an institutional outgrowth of the New Left movement of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1981, political scholar Joshua Muravchik wrote that its &quot;genius&quot; lay in how it acted &quot;as a bridge between radicalism and the liberal establishment.&quot; According to Emory University historian Harvey Klehr, writing in 1988, the IPS served &quot;as an intellectual nerve center for the radical movement.&quot; Two decades after its start, co-founder Marcus Raskin commented the IPS &quot;had an extraordinary conceit. We were going to speak truth to power.&quot; A 2022 report by the Capital Research Center, &quot;Institute for Policy Studies: The Left&#x27;s Original Think Tank&quot;, stated that the IPS at present &quot;probably doesn&#x27;t make the shortlist of finalists for most influential left-of-center think tank in the country&quot;, compared to the Center for American Progress, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, or the Urban Institute, but &quot;if one stretches the timeline back far enough&quot;, the IPS can be seen as a member of that group.

=== 1960s ===

The IPS was founded in 1963 by Raskin and Richard Barnet as the think tank for &quot;the most powerful of the powerless&quot;. The founders were officials in the John F. Kennedy administration – Raskin, then in his twenties, was working as a White House aide for McGeorge Bundy, and Barnet served in a similar role to John J. McCloy. They had become disillusioned by priorities based on politics rather than moral issues.

Against the backdrop of the counterculture of the 1960s, the opposition to US involvement in the Vietnam War, and the civil rights movement, the IPS &quot;became a brand name for its unabashedly left-wing tone&quot;, in contrast with RAND and the largely conservative think tanks. Members of these movements came to IPS headquarters in Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Dupont Circle. In a 2009 interview, Raskin said, &quot;Very quickly, with the Vietnam war, the civil rights movement, the women&#x27;s movement, the institute became a place where different people from the movements came. People came in from demonstrations [and] camped out in the offices.&quot;

According to Raskin, &quot;Early on [the IPS] had predicted that Vietnam would be a disaster.&quot; During the presidency of Lyndon Johnson, Raskin was indicted by the federal government for the 1965 publication of &quot;tens of thousands of copies of an IPS anti-war Vietnam Reader&quot;—a kind of textbook for anti-war teach-ins. He was charged with encouraging people to resist the draft. In 1967, Raskin and IPS Fellow Arthur Waskow penned &quot;A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority&quot;, a document signed by dozens of scholars and religious leaders which helped to launch the draft resistance movement.

In 1964, several leading black activists joined the institute&#x27;s staff and made IPS into a base for supporting the civil rights movement. Fellow Bob Moses organized trainings for field organizers of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee on the links between civil rights theory and practice, while Ivanhoe Donaldson initiated an assembly of black government officials. Co-writer of the Port Huron Statement at Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and civil rights veteran, IPS Fellow Robb Burlage launched the critical health care justice movement in 1967 with his &quot;Burlage Report&quot;. The next year, Burlage founded the Health Policy Advisory Center, which began publishing the &quot;Health/Pac Bulletin&quot;. The &quot;Bulletin&quot;&#x27;s broad audience included &quot;radicalized medical students and physicians and neighborhood activists&quot; and &quot;nervous health administrators at powerful medical centers pilloried in each issue&quot;; it became a bimonthly until its closure in 1994.

The IPS was also at the forefront of the feminist movement. Fellow Charlotte Bunch organized a significant women&#x27;s liberation conference in 1966 and later launched &quot;&quot;, a feminist journal. Rita Mae Brown wrote and published her notable lesbian coming-of-age novel, &quot;Rubyfruit Jungle,&quot; while on the staff in the 1970s.

IPS also organized congressional seminars and published numerous books that challenged the national security state, including Gar Alperovitz&#x27;s &quot;Atomic Diplomacy&quot; and Barnet&#x27;s &quot;Intervention and Revolution&quot;. IPS was the object of repeated FBI and Internal Revenue Service probes. The Nixon administration placed Barnet and Raskin on its expanded Enemies List.

===1970s===
In 1971, Raskin received &quot;a mountain of paper&quot; from a source that was later identified as Daniel Ellsberg. These became known as the Pentagon Papers. Raskin played his &quot;customary catalytic role&quot; by putting Ellsberg in touch with &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Neil Sheehan.

In 1974, the institute created an Organizing Committee for the Fifth Estate as part of its Center for National Security Studies which published the magazine &quot;CounterSpy&quot; until 1984. That year, the Transnational Institute (TNI), a progressive think tank based in Amsterdam, was established as the IPS&#x27;s international program, later becoming an independent non-profit.

In 1976, agents of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet assassinated two IPS staff members on Washington&#x27;s Embassy Row. The target of the car bomb attack was Orlando Letelier, a former Chilean government minister and ambassador to the United States, one of Pinochet&#x27;s most outspoken critics and the head of the Transnational Institute. Ronni Karpen Moffitt, a 25-year-old IPS development associate, was also killed. The IPS hosts an annual human rights award in the names of Letelier and Moffitt to honor them while celebrating new heroes of the human rights movement from the US and elsewhere in the Americas. The award recipients receive the Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award.

In 1977, IPS created the Government Accountability Project (GAP), a nonprofit whistleblower protection and advocacy organization. According to GAP, it was formed &quot;in response to several whistleblowers, such as Daniel Ellsberg, who came to IPS about White House, FBI and Pentagon scandals&quot;.

In its attention to the role of multinational corporations, the IPS was an early critic of what has come to be called globalization. Barnet&#x27;s 1974 examination of the power of multinational corporations, &quot;Global Reach: The Power of the Multinational Corporations&quot; (co-written with Ronald E. Muller), appeared even as the concept of multinationals was being academically defined.

===1980s===
In the 1980s, Raskin served as chair of the SANE/Freeze campaign. The IPS also became heavily involved in supporting the movement against US intervention in Central America. IPS Director Robert Borosage and other staff helped draft &quot;Changing Course: Blueprint for Peace in Central America and the Caribbean&quot;, which was used by hundreds of schools, labor unions, churches, and citizen organizations as a challenge to US policy in the region.

In 1985, Fellow Roger Wilkins helped found the Free South Africa Movement, which organized a year-long series of demonstrations that led to the imposition of US sanctions. In 1987, S. Steven Powell published his non-fiction &quot;Covert Cadre: Inside the Institute for Policy Studies,&quot; in which he provided &quot;by far the single most compendious collection of facts about IPS that anyone has yet compiled&quot;, according to a lengthy critical review by Joshua Muravchik.

In 1986, after six years of the Reagan administration, Sidney Blumenthal noted, &quot;Ironically, as IPS has declined in Washington influence, its stature has grown in conservative demonology. In the Reagan era, the institute has loomed as a right-wing obsession and received most of its publicity by serving as a target.&quot; Conservative think tanks American Enterprise Institute and The Heritage Foundation described the IPS as the &quot;far left&quot; or &quot;radical left&quot; of the late 1980s, In a mid-80s essay in the journal &quot;World Affairs&quot;, author Joshua Muravchik coined &quot;communophilism&quot; – an &quot;eclectic and undisciplined&quot; sympathy to communist movements and governments, &quot;virulently anti capitalist and virulently critical of the capitalist democracies of the West&quot; – to describe the IPS.

In his 1988 book &quot;Far Left of Center: The American Radical Left Today,&quot; historian Klehr wrote: &quot;[it provides] sustenance and support for a variety of causes, ranging from nuclear and anti-intervention issues to support for Marxist insurgencies. IPS brings together activists and academics and provides a place where they can mingle with congressmen and other policymakers and public figures&quot;.

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, the IPS began monitoring the environmental impacts of US trade, investment, and drug policies. In 1994, it published the first annual &quot;Executive Excess&quot; report, examining compensation for top level executives and its impacts.

=== 2000s ===
During the 2000s, the IPS strongly opposed the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s actions during the &quot;war on terror&quot;, and argued against the US invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11.

=== 2010 – present ===
In recent years, the IPS has been critical of US foreign policy in the Middle East, particularly in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Currently, its main focus is in five areas: economic inequality, race and gender considerations, climate change, foreign policy, and leadership development.

During the 2020 US election cycle, Bernie Sanders used IPS research in his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. A number of his wealth inequality arguments were based on a 2017 IPS research paper. According to &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Sanders gets some of his sharpest talking points about inequality from the Institute for Policy Studies, a more radical outfit that is usually ignored by the mainstream of the Democratic Party.&quot;

As of 2024, the IPS supports a number of independent projects, among them: Foreign Policy in Focus, a virtual think tank that seeks &quot;to make the United States a more responsible global partner&quot;; the Global Economy Program, aiming to &quot;speed the transition to an equitable and sustainable economy while reversing today&#x27;s extreme levels of economic and racial inequality and excessive corporate and Wall Street power&quot;; the National Priorities Project, focused on the US federal budget and spending &quot;that prioritizes peace, economic opportunity, and shared prosperity for all&quot;; the New Internationalism project, working to &quot;end wars and militarism, with a focus on U.S. policy&quot;; and the Program on Inequality and the Common Good, addressing income inequality and &quot;extreme wealth concentration&quot;.

== Funding ==
IPS operates as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Start-up funding came mostly from the Stern Family Fund (which was in large part endowed by the estate of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. chairman Julius Rosenwald). During the 1960s, significant financial supporters included Sears heir, Philip Stern, the Ford Foundation, the D.J. Bernstein Foundation, the EDO Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, banker James Warburg, and the Field Foundation. During the 1970s and 1980s, much of the funding came from the Samuel Rubin Foundation. In later years, the MacArthur Foundation made significant contributions. In 2018, 59% of revenue came from foundations and 36% from individual donations. In 2022, reported revenue was $5.78 million against $5.37 million in expenses. The IPS bylaws prohibit it from accepting government funding.

==Notable people==
The 14-member IPS board of trustees in 2024 includes actor Danny Glover, Code Pink co-founder Jodie Evans, Ford Foundation vice-president of US Programs Sarita Gupta, and editorial director and publisher of &quot;The Nation&quot; Katrina vanden Heuvel. Past and current IPS associates include:

<doc id="482481" wikidata="Q1758466" url="?curid=482481" title="Stronsay">
<text>Stronsay () is an island in Orkney, Scotland. It is known as Orkney&#x27;s &#x27;Island of Bays&#x27;, owing to an irregular shape with miles of coastline, with three large bays separated by two isthmuses: St Catherine&#x27;s Bay to the west, the Bay of Holland to the south and Mill Bay to the east. Stronsay is in area, and in altitude at its highest point. It has a usually resident population of 349. The main village is Whitehall, home to a heritage centre.

Sights on the island include the Vat of Kirbister, a natural arch described as the &quot;finest in Orkney&quot;, white sand beaches in the three bays, and various seabirds amongst which are Arctic terns.

==Environment==
===Geography and geology===

As with most of Orkney, Stronsay is made up of Old Red Sandstone which has produced a fine soil in many places. It is generally low-lying.

On the eastern coast, spectacular rock formations include the Vat of Kirbister – Stronsay&#x27;s famous natural rock arch, often described as the finest in Orkney. The coast around Odiness Bay features numerous dramatic geos, caves, flagstone rock platforms and sea stacks, including Tam&#x27;s Castle, reputed to have once housed a hermitage on its flat summit.

Stronsay is the seventh largest of the Orkney Islands. Surrounding small islands include Linga Holm, Papa Stronsay, the Holm of Huip (named after a district in north west Stronsay) and the Holms of Spurness. To the north is Sanday, to the north west Eday, to the south west Shapinsay and Mainland Orkney, and the islet of Auskerry due south.

===Wildlife===

While the landscape has few trees, the fertile soil supports a wide variety of wildflowers, including oysterplant, frog orchids, adder&#x27;s tongue, and also a naturalised population of Patagonian ragwort. Seals can also be spotted at many locations, including the Ayre of the Myers, a popular picnic spot near Whitehall, at the twin south-facing bays at Houseby and Sand of Crook or from the seal-hide near Holland Bay.

There is a wide variety of birds on the island, and birdwatchers have recorded many rarities. Common species include whooper swan, various ducks and geese including the greater white-fronted goose, as well as common redshank, common snipe, common quail, great skua, corn bunting and corncrake, the last of which is rare in Scotland. Many seabirds can be seen from Lamb Ness and Lamb Head. The Stronsay Bird Reserve is said to be one of the best sites in Europe to spot rare migrants such as American golden plover, Arctic redpoll, pied wheatear, rustic bunting, scarlet rosefinch, tawny pipit and various warblers, including Radde&#x27;s warbler, marsh warbler and western subalpine warbler.

Both the Rothiesholm Peninsula and coastline of south-eastern Stronsay have been designated Important Bird Areas (IBAs) by BirdLife International because they support breeding seabirds.

==History==
Two flint arrowheads discovered at a site investigated by Orkney College in April 2007 are believed to date from the late Paleolithic or early Mesolithic periods some 10–12,000 years ago. They were found amongst a scattered collection of other tools on a farm. If confirmed, they could be the earliest human artifacts found in Scotland.

The island is now agricultural, but during the 18th and 19th centuries, kelp collection and herring curing employed up to 5000 people. The population was over 1000 for the entire 19th century and until the mid-20th century, with the 1891 census recording a population of 1275, excluding seasonal itinerants involved in the herring industry.

The kelp burning industry was started by James Fea of Whitehall in 1727, and thrived during the remainder of the 18th century, lasting into the early 19th century; some of the kiln ruins can still be seen.

==Demography and economy==
The usual resident population of the island in 2011 was 349, compared to 342 in 2001. The island is mainly agricultural with farming and fishing the main industries. Efforts are being made by the community to develop the economy by improving tourism infrastructure. There is a thriving craft community, with several specialised craft shops.

Much of the settlement is strung out along the island&#x27;s main road, but the main population centre is Whitehall village, in the north of the island, with a row of seafront houses and two piers, a link to the village&#x27;s foundation as a herring fishing station in the 19th century. There is a variety of accommodation in Whitehall, including the Stronsay Hotel, Storehouse B&amp;B and FishMart hostel. The island&#x27;s school is well-resourced and caters for nursery, primary and secondary pupils.

Orkney Ferries sail from Whitehall to Kirkwall on the Orkney Mainland, and planes fly there from the island&#x27;s airstrip (Stronsay Airport), also in the north of the island.

Whitehall overlooks the separate island of Papa Stronsay, across the blue waters of Papa Sound. A prominent feature of the smaller island is the monastery complex of the Transalpine Redemptorist monks who live there. Visitors are welcome and the monks can help arrange boat trips.

Moncur Memorial Church is the Church of Scotland centre of worship on Stronsay and there is a Catholic chapel in Whitehall, which is part of the Diocese of Aberdeen.

<doc id="482493" wikidata="Q1703515" url="?curid=482493" title="Pie and mash">
<text>Pie and mash is a traditional working-class food, originating in the Docks of London. Often accompanied with jellied eels, the dish has been popularised as &quot;a Cockney classic&quot;. It typically consists of a minced beef pie, mashed potato, and a parsley sauce known as liquor. Pie, mash and eel shops have been in London since the 19th century, and are still common in East and South London, and in many parts of Kent and Essex.

==History==
During the Victorian era, industrial air pollution tended to be worse in the east and southeast of London because of the prevailing westerly wind, with the result that the East End was settled more by the working classes, while the western part of the city was home to higher social classes.

The savoury pie had long been a traditional food, and its small handsized form also made it a transportable meal, protected from dirt by its cold pastry crust, and filled with cheap minced meat, usually mutton.

Jellied eels are often associated with pie and mash, as European eels cooked in gelatine also became a common worker&#x27;s meal, since eels were one of the few forms of fish that could survive in the heavily polluted River Thames and London&#x27;s other rivers at that time. Supply was plentiful through the late 19th century, particularly from the Dutch fishing boats landing catches at Billingsgate Fish Market.

During World War II, government food rationing threatened pie and mash shops with closure. However, due to public demand the Ministry of Food was persuaded to allow these traditional eateries to remain open. As a result, pie and mash supplemented family rations amid the widespread national food shortages and along with fish and chips, that other traditional British working-class dish, pie and mash increased in popularity among middle-class families too.

Since 2010, as revealed in a joint study by the Zoological Society of London and the Environment Agency, the number of eels captured in research traps in the River Thames fell from 1,500 in 2005 to 50 in 2010, meaning most eels used in pie and mash shops are now from the Netherlands and Northern Ireland.

While eel consumption continues to go down in the 21st century (in 2000, there was only one stall selling live eels in Billingsgate Market), the number of eel and pie shops has continued to go down: there were 87 eel and pie shops in Greater London in 1995, compared to around 110 at the end of 1800. In 2024 there are just 34 pie shops left. 

==Composition==
The main dish sold is pie and mash, a minced-beef and cold-water-pastry pie served with mashed potato. There should be two types of pastry used; the bottom or base should be suet pastry and the top can be rough puff or short. It is common for the mashed potato to be spread around one side of the plate and for a type of parsley sauce to be present. This is commonly called &quot;liquor sauce&quot; or simply &quot;liquor&quot; (liquor as in a liquid in which something has been steeped or cooked), traditionally made using the water kept from the preparation of the stewed eels. However, many shops no longer use stewed eel water in their parsley liquor. The sauce traditionally has a green colour, from the parsley.

==Shops==
Before shops became common, trading took place from braziers or carts. It was not until late Victorian times that shops began to appear. The first recorded shop was Henry Blanchard’s at 101 Union Street in Southwark in 1844 which was described as an “Eel Pie House”. The shops have become part of the local community and heritage of their area; for example, L. Manze in Walthamstow became Grade II listed by English Heritage in 2013 due to its architectural and cultural significance.

Traditionally, pie and mash shops have white tile walls with mirrors, and marble floors, tables and work tops, all of which are easy to clean. They give the shops, never called restaurants or café, a late Victorian or Art Deco appearance.

Because of the large number of pleasure boat steamer companies offering Sunday trips on the River Thames, many Eastenders used them to explore the more gentrified west of London. The result was that many also wanted their traditional foods of ale and pie and mash, resulting in the renaming of both a hotel that they frequently visited and the island on which it sat in Twickenham to Eel Pie Island in the early 1900s.

== 21st-century decline and current prospect ==
With the gentrification of South and East London as well as the docklands area, there have been significant socio-economic and demographic changes in the London neighbourhoods traditionally most associated with pie and mash. Through the 2020s, industry experts continue to note that affluent new locals are now more interested in &quot;lattes and paninis&quot; than a dish typically associated with working-class Londoners. As a result of the declining customer base, historic and famous pie and mash shops including L. Manze in Walthamstow have been forced to close and their premises taken over by new incumbents. In May 2023, for example, the iconic Grade II listed art-deco building at 9 Broadway Market in Hackney, which had been home to F. Cooke&#x27;s pie and mash shop for the previous 120 years, was taken over by Cubitts, a company that designs and handcrafts bespoke eyewear. W.J. Arments Eel &amp; Pie House at Walworth, founded in 1914, with its glazed tiled walls, marble table tops, opening sash windows and a floor covered with sawdust, is one of the few shops to have thrived in the changing socio-economic climate.

Proposals have been raised in the British Parliament to declare a Traditional speciality guaranteed label for the dish.

<text>Ecgberht II was king of Kent jointly with Heaberht.

Ecgberht II is known from his coins and charters, ranging from 765 to 779, two of which were witnessed or confirmed by Heaberht.

Ecgberht II acceded by 765, when he issued his earliest surviving charter. However, around this time Offa, king of Mercia, appears to have been attempting to rule Kent directly, as he seems to have issued or confirmed a number of charters relating to Kent. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, a battle was fought at Otford in 776, and, although the outcome was not recorded, the fact that Kent seems to have remained independent for several years afterward suggests that Ecgberht was victorious. It is known that he remained king until at least 779, the date of his latest charter.

<doc id="482498" wikidata="Q1282606" url="?curid=482498" title="Eday">
<text>Eday (, ) is one of the islands of Orkney, which are located to the north of the Scottish mainland. One of the North Isles, Eday is about from the Orkney Mainland. With an area of , it is the ninth-largest island of the archipelago. The bedrock of the island is Old Red Sandstone, which is exposed along the sea-cliffs.

There are various well-preserved Neolithic tombs, as well as evidence of Bronze Age settlement and the remains of a Norse-era castle. During the period of Scottish rule the substantial property of Carrick House was developed at Calfsound, which became a burgh for a short period. During the British era many agricultural improvements were introduced, although there has been a substantial decline in the population since the mid-nineteenth century. In the twenty-first century the Eday Partnership has had success in promoting the island&#x27;s economy. Local placenames reflect the diverse linguistic heritage and the landscapes of the island and its surrounding seas attract abundant wildlife.

==Etymology==

&quot;Eday&quot; is a name derived from the Old Norse &quot;eið&quot; and means &quot;isthmus island&quot;. This is a name specifically associated with economic activity used only where the isthmus has been a &quot;route for the movement of goods and/or boats from one coast to another&quot;.

There are numerous other &quot;eið&quot; names in the islands of the North Atlantic and those in Orkney include Hoxa (&quot;Haugeið&quot;) on South Ronaldsay, Aith (found on Walls, Stronsay and the west Mainland) and Scapa in St Ola which is derived from the Norse &quot;Skálpeið&quot;. Bay of Doomy, near the central isthmus on Eday, may also have a name derived from &quot;dómr-eið&quot;, meaning &quot;isthmus of the courthouse&quot;, indicating it could have been an important meeting place during the Norse period of Scottish history. In the 17th century Eday was also known as &quot;Heth Øy&quot;.

In common with elsewhere in the Orkney islands, place names are generally a mixture of Norse, Scots and English influences. Any Pictish names that existed before the arrival of Scandinavian settlers on Eday appear to have been obliterated. The common suffix -quoy is from the Old Norse &quot;kví-ló&quot; and signifies an enclosure in a marshy area. Skaill on the east coast is from the Norse &quot;skáli&quot; and suggests an important farm on good fertile land that was associated with several smaller tunships. The Bay of London also has Norse origins, &quot;lund-inn&quot; meaning &quot;woodland&quot;, although this is no longer an apt description for this largely treeless landscape. Old Norse &quot;lundi&quot; means &quot;puffin&quot;, which creatures may once have nested in sandy land at the back of the bay.

Orkney was Christianised before the arrival of Viking settlers, and there are various local &quot;Papa&quot; names that reflect the activities of the pre-Norse papar monks there. The farm of Papleyhouse near Linkataing may indicate such a link to the past, although the connection is by no means certain. The name &quot;geo&quot;, which occurs frequently around the rocky coast, is from the Norse &quot;gjá&quot; and means a narrow and deep cleft in the face of a cliff.

==Geography and geology==

Eday is long from north to south but only just over 500 metres wide at the narrow neck of land between the Sands of Doomy and Bay of London and has been described as being &quot;nipped at the waist&quot;. The centre of the island is largely moorland covered with heather, and cultivation is confined to the coasts.

The highest points are Flaughton Hill at the island&#x27;s centre, Fersness Hill at West Side, Vinquoy Hill to the north and Ward Hill to the south, which reaches . In Orkney this last name, which derives from the Norse &quot;varði&quot;, is a common one for the highest point on an island as in the past they were used for lighting warning beacons.

The largest body of water is the sea southeast of Vinquoy Hill. Loch of Doomy lies on the western side of the narrow &quot;waist&quot; and the smaller Loch Carrick on the north coast.

The population is dispersed along the coastal farmsteads and nowhere on the island has the status of a village. Calfsound is the most populous of the settled areas, with other concentrations at Millbounds on the east coast, which has a post office and a community facility in a converted chapel, and Backaland in the south where the ferry from the Mainland docks.
Eday is surrounded by other small islands that make up the &quot;seemingly impossible green and russet jigsaw of Orkney&#x27;s North Isles&quot;. Calf of Eday lies north of the settlement of Calfsound. Further east is Sanday across the Eday Sound. Stronsay and Linga Holm are to the south east and Muckle Green Holm to the south west beyond the straits known as the Fall of Warness. Egilsay lies some due west. Rusk Holm, Faray and Holm of Faray lie beyond the Sound of Faray to the northwest, and beyond them is the larger island of Westray.

In common with its neighbouring isles, Eday is largely formed from Middle Devonian Old Red Sandstone deposited in the Orcadian Basin. The Eday Group is the name for a substantial sequence of sandstones that is found at many locations in Orkney, for which Eday and the area around Eday Sound are the type area. In places it is up to thick, and is largely composed of yellow and red sandstones with intervening grey flagstones and marls. The rock is easily quarried and some of the yellow sandstones from Fersness were used in the construction of St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall. The Devonian sequence is deformed into a major fold, the north–south trending Eday Syncline, with the youngest part of the sequence, the Upper Eday Sandstone outcropping in the north of the island from Bay of Cusby to Red Head. The oldest part of the sequence, the Rousay Flagstones are found on the eastern side of the island at Bight of Milldale and from Kirk Taing to War Ness, and to the west from Sealskerry Bay to Fersness. Veness is formed of Upper Eday Sandstone downfaulted against the flagstones.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The very limited archaeological record provides scant evidence of Mesolithic life in Orkney, but the later assemblage of houses and monumental Neolithic structures in the archipelago is without parallel in the United Kingdom.

Vinquoy chambered cairn, located in a commanding position overlooking the Calf Sound, is in diameter and high. The narrow entrance passage of this Maeshowe-type tomb leads to a central chamber with four side-cells. Other sites of interest on Eday include the Stone of Setter standing stone that dominates the col north of Mill Loch, and which at high is one of the tallest monoliths in Orkney. There are two more chambered cairns at Braeside and Huntersquoy and another on the Calf of Eday. Rectangular in shape, it was excavated in 1936–37 and contains a small chamber with two compartments and a larger one with four stalls that has a separate entrance and was probably added at a later date.

Although there are several Bronze Age sites on the island, they provide less dramatic remains. At Warness in the south west there is a burnt mound from this period and there are the ruins of two houses of a similar age on Holm of Faray near the Point of Dogs Bones. The Fold of Setter is an Bronze Age enclosure located to the north of Mill Loch. There is the site of a large Iron Age roundhouse containing a saddle quern at Linkataing in north west Eday. Latterly, Orkney was settled by the Picts although the archaeological evidence is sparse.

===Norse colonisation===
It is not known &quot;when and how the Vikings conquered and occupied the Isles&quot;, and although Norse contacts with Scotland certainly predate the first written records in the 8th century, their nature and frequency are unknown. The place name evidence of a Norse presence on Eday is conclusive and very little is known about the specifics of life on the island at this time. The Norse-era ruins of the Castle of Stackel Brae, which dates from the 12th or 13th century, lie under a green mound to the east of the Bay of Greentoft. The castle may have been the most important building on Eday at this time.

===Scottish rule===
In 1468 Orkney became part of the Kingdom of Scotland and an influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers, fishermen and merchants that called themselves &quot;comunitatis Orcadie&quot; and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords. Nonetheless, the actions of the aristocracy continue to provide much of the information known about affairs on Eday at the time. In 1561, during the Reformation, Edward Sinclair was granted the feu of Eday by Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney. These were turbulent times—Sinclair&#x27;s duties included to defend the reforming Bishop &quot;against whatsoever invaders&quot;—and later that year he was one of the ringleaders of an anti-Catholic riot in Kirkwall.

His son William took over the running of the Eday estate in due course, but it became burdened with debt. In 1601 when Edward was &quot;an auld decrepit man ... aged 100 or thereby&quot; William attempted to sell the family interest to George Sinclair the Earl of Caithness. The new proprietor sent half a dozen boatloads of &quot;vagabondis, broken Highland men of Caithness&quot; to Eday, much to the alarm of the notorious Earl Patrick of Orkney. Earl Patrick was able to use the poor relationship between the elderly father Edward and his son, (the former claiming William fired muskets at him and grabbed him by the neck like a dog) to take action. Acting, so he alleged, on behalf of Edward, Earl Patrick evicted William, took the Eday the rents for himself and profited from the extraction of building stone from Towback quarry.

John Stewart, Earl of Carrick, the brother of Earl Patrick, was granted Eday in 1632 and he constructed Carrick House at Calfsound shortly thereafter. He used peat to manufacture salt from salt pans at both Carrick and on the Calf of Eday. The product was described as &quot;quite fine&quot; in the 17th century when it was undertaken on a substantial scale although of &quot;indifferent quality&quot; in the early 19th century when it was being conducted as a cottage industry. Peat extraction was also an important industry in the past as Sanday and North Ronaldsay obtained most of their fuel from Eday and this material was also exported to whisky distilleries on mainland Scotland.

Stewart&#x27;s ambitions for Calfsound were considerable. Described as the &quot;town and port&quot; of Carrick it became a burgh (the only other one in Orkney being Kirkwall) with the right to appoint baillies and hold markets but it was never likely to flourish in such a location.

===British era===

From the first decade of the 18th century Orkney became part of the new Kingdom of Great Britain. This was a time of great interest in agricultural improvement although the changes this brought about were not of significance in Orkney until the mid-nineteenth century. For example, no potatoes were grown on Eday until around 1780. By comparison to these gradual changes, Carrick House saw drama in 1725. The property was now owned by James Fea who had been a school friend of a &quot;Mr Smith&quot;, a trader of Stromness. When Smith was unmasked as the notorious pirate John Gow he sought to escape the attentions of the authorities by making for Eday via a raid on Hall of Clestrain, in Orphir. When Gow&#x27;s ship &quot;Revenge&quot; ran aground on the Calf of Eday, Fea&#x27;s men took him prisoner and held him at Carrick House, for which Fea was given a £1,700 reward. The bell from the &quot;Revenge&quot; is still in Carrick House.

In the early nineteenth century the kelp industry provided significant employment on some of the Orkney islands, but when the market collapsed between 1830 and 1832 it caused considerable hardship. North Ronaldsay was especially hard-hit and several families were allowed to resettle from there to develop land at Westside on Eday. Rising populations meant increasing land values, especially for small tenancies. In 1843 crofts were valued at on Eday, nearly three times the price for larger farms. However, the 20th century saw decline. Immigration even from mainland Scotland was essentially unknown even in the late 1950s and the population in 2001 was about an eighth of the total 160 years earlier. In the census of 2011, it was found that 50% of the residents of the island were born in England, the most of all Scotland&#x27;s islands.

==Transport and economy==
Eday can be reached by both sea and air from the Orkney Mainland. Orkney Ferries provide daily ferry crossings to Backaland on Eday from Kirkwall. The Orkney inter-island air service, operated by Loganair, connects Kirkwall Airport with Eday London Airport. In 2014 the Orkney Islands Council began consultation to build a number of fixed crossings between seven of the Orkney Islands. This includes the possibility of a 2.6 mile bridge between Eday and Papa Westray.

Farming and crofting are mainstays of the local economy, especially livestock husbandry. Flocks of sheep are also kept on Faray.

The European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) based at Stromness is a Scottish Government-backed research facility. They have installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney mainland and a tidal power testing station, overlooking the Fall of Warness, on Eday. The test site was chosen because of the marine currents that reach almost at spring tides. There are seven offshore testing berths connected to the 33KV North Isles section of the national grid, via an underground cable.

Eday Partnership, the local development trust is active in promoting the island&#x27;s economy and has instigated numerous projects, including Eday Heritage Centre, and the purchase of a new diesel tank for the island. Eday&#x27;s various community projects contributed £380,000 to the island&#x27;s economy from 2005 to 2007 and a 900 kW community-owned wind turbine is planned. The income that this asset will generate is expected to reduce fuel poverty on the island, support new community enterprises and create affordable housing.

In July 2008, the island celebrated the opening of the Eday Heritage and Visitor Centre in the restored former Baptist Church. There is a heritage display area, a permanent archive, a café and a tourist information point. The Eday Oral History Project records life on the island in the past and is also housed within the centre, which has its own 6 kW wind turbine.

The island&#x27;s population was 160 as recorded by the 2011 census an increase of over 30% since 2001 when there were 121 usual residents. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.

==Natural history==

In the early 19th century Patrick Neill wrote of the local flora that &quot;Eda is a mossy island; a great part of it consisting of barren marshy heaths. &quot;Juncus uliginosus&quot; here covers whole acres; and the pretty little plant &quot;Radiola millegran&quot;, or all-seed, is everywhere strewed.&quot; Over 120 species of wild plants have been recorded on the island, including bog myrtle found nowhere else in Orkney.

In the mid-17th century, Eday was described as being &quot;absolutely full of moorland birds&quot;, and today there are red-throated divers on Mill Loch, Arctic skuas and bonxies on the moors and black guillemot offshore. Shore birds include meadow pipit, rock pipit and ringed plover. The woodland at Carrick House attracts a variety of migrants, and otters can be seen around the coasts. There are colonies of harbour and grey seals on Muckle Green Holm, Little Green Holm, Faray and Holm of Faray, and white-beaked dolphin, minke whale and killer whale are occasional visitors to the area. A ranger provides guided walks throughout the year.

<text>Grand Marnier () is a French brand of liqueurs. The brand&#x27;s best-known product is Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge, an orange-flavored liqueur created in 1880 by Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle. It is made from a blend of Cognac brandy, distilled essence of bitter orange, and sugar, containing 40% alcohol (70 British proof/ 80 US proof). It is commonly consumed &quot;neat&quot; as a cordial or a digestif, and can be used in mixed drinks and desserts. Popular examples of the latter include crêpes Suzette and crêpes au Grand Marnier. 

Aside from Cordon Rouge, the Grand Marnier line includes other liqueurs, most of which can be used similarly.

==History==
According to its official website, Grand Marnier&#x27;s first distillery was built in 1827 by Jean Baptiste Lapostolle in the village of Neauphle-le-Château. His granddaughter Julia married Louis-Alexandre Marnier in 1876, and four years later, the Marniers released a signature cognac with Haitian bitter orange.

Swiss hotelier César Ritz (1850–1918) reportedly came up with the name &quot;Grand Marnier&quot; for Marnier-Lapostolle, who in return helped him purchase and establish the Hotel Ritz Paris. During the extravagant Belle Époque, Grand Marnier was served in the Ritz Hotel as well as the Savoy Hotel. The brand has released anniversary editions of its well-known liqueur lines and became popular in the United States in the 1980s.

On 15 March 2016, the Campari Group announced a friendly takeover offer for Société des Produits Marnier Lapostolle S.A., the owner of Grand Marnier.

==Varieties==

===Cordon Rouge===
Cordon Rouge (&quot;Red Ribbon&quot;) is an orange-flavored cognac liqueur and the original Grand Marnier liqueur, created in 1880 by Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle. It is consumed neat and is also used in mixed drinks and desserts.

====Signature Series====
* Natural Cherry – A blend of Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge with wild tropical Haitian and Dominican oranges and European Griotte cherries.
* Raspberry Peach – A blend of European raspberries and rare red peaches from Ardèche, in the South of France, combined with Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge.

===Cordon Jaune===
&quot;Cordon Jaune&quot; (&quot;Yellow Ribbon&quot;) was a triple-sec Curaçao-like liqueur that was made with neutral grain spirit instead of Cognac. The production stopped on 1 January 2017, after the company was taken over by Campari.

===Cuvée du Centenaire===
&quot;Cuvée du Centenaire&quot; (&quot;Centennial Edition&quot;) was first released in limited quantities in 1927 to commemorate the 100th anniversary. It is made with up to 25-year-old fine cognacs and is consumed neat. On average, Cuvée du Centenaire is $145 per bottle.

===Cuvée Spéciale Cent Cinquantenaire===
The &quot;Cuvée Spéciale Cent Cinquantenaire&quot; (&quot;Special Sesquicentennial Edition&quot;) was created in 1977 to honor the 150th anniversary of the brand and is currently the most expensive variety of Grand Marnier. It is made with up to 50-year-old cognacs in frosted glass bottles featuring hand-painted Art Nouveau decorations. In 2005, it was marketed with the slogan &quot;Hard to find, impossible to pronounce, and prohibitively expensive.&quot;

===Cuvée Louis-Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle===
Cuvée Louis-Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle is a special tribute to the founder of Grand Marnier, Louis-Alexandre Marnier Lapostolle. Made from 82% Cognac and 18% orange liqueur, it has a rich intensity of macerated citrus combined with the warming flavors of Cognac, pine, and Earl Grey tea on the finish.

== Use ==
===As a cordial===
Grand Marnier is commonly consumed &quot;neat&quot; as a cordial or a digestif.

=== In mixed drinks ===
Grand Marnier can be used in mixed drinks. It can be used as an alternative to Cointreau or triple sec, orange-flavored liqueurs made from neutral spirits. Some examples of these include the Cosmopolitan, Margarita, Sangria, Sidecar, and the B-52.

=== In food ===
Grand Marnier is used in the preparation of flambé dishes, such as crêpes Suzette, Grand Marnier soufflé and crème brûlée. It can also be used in the sauce of the &quot;Canard à l&#x27;orange&quot; roasted duck dish. It is also an ingredient in several kinds of pastries, such as liquor cream buns and the French Christmas dessert known as &quot;Bûche de Noël&quot; (Yule log). It is frequently used in recipes for cranberry sauce, as sweetness and citrus can be a contrast to the bitterness of cranberries. It can be used in some fruitcake recipes instead of brandy. It can also be drizzled over vanilla ice cream.

== Awards and recognition ==
In 2001, Grand Marnier&#x27;s Cordon Rouge won the Gold Medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. It was also awarded the 4 Star recommendation from F. Paul Pacult&#x27;s Kindred Spirits in the Spirit Journal Guide.

<doc id="482513" wikidata="Q1055869" url="?curid=482513" title="Bleu celeste">
<text>Bleu celeste (, &quot;sky blue&quot;) is a rarely occurring and non-standard tincture in heraldry (not being one of the seven main colours or metals or the three &quot;staynard colours&quot;). This tincture is sometimes also called ciel or simply celeste. It is depicted in a lighter shade than the range of shades of the more traditional tincture azure, which is the standard blue used in heraldry.

Generally considered to be European rather than English or Scottish, after the First World War it started to appear in England in arms and badges relating to the Royal Air Force, though it is still doubtful if any more than a dozen examples could be found in British heraldry, and most British heralds consider it unheraldic. While in the post-World War I period bleu-celeste is depicted as a darker shade, in prior times it was depicted as very light, and has even been treated as a metal, as azure charges have been placed on a bleu celeste field, and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

Regardless, &quot;bleu celeste&quot; is still used by heraldic authorities, such as Britain&#x27;s College of Arms in London, with one example of the arms of Jacob Flamberg being granted in 2016 using bleu celeste in the blazon for the field, mantling and charge, in each case &quot;per pale/party&quot; with sable.

&quot;Per pale Bleu Celeste and Sable on a Fess wavy between three Plum Trees eradicated Argent a Wolf courant per pale Sable and Bleu Celeste langued and armed Gules&quot; and &quot;Party Bleu Celeste and Sable doubled Argent&quot;

Bleu celeste can also be seen in the arms of Israel and Peru and also in the arms of former Canadian Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn. In the arms of the University of Natal Athletic Union the &quot;azure&quot; is defined as &quot;sky blue&quot;.

==Light blue==
In addition to bleu celeste, there is also an apparently unique example in British heraldry of the use of &quot;light blue&quot; in the Municipal Borough of Barnes, through which the Oxford versus Cambridge boat race passes on the Thames. The arms show the respective blades of the teams&#x27; oars, coloured dark Oxford blue and light Cambridge blue, and may be blazoned thus:

:&quot;Azure, on a saltire Or between four ostrich feathers argent, two oars in saltire proper, the blade of that to the dexter dark blue and that to the sinister light blue.&quot;

When in 1965 that borough merged with its neighbours to form the Borough of Richmond upon Thames, the coloured oars were transferred to the supporters in the arms of the new borough.

<doc id="482514" wikidata="Q4749165" url="?curid=482514" title="Amy Dillwyn">
<text>Elizabeth Amy Dillwyn (16 May 1845 – 13 December 1935) was a Welsh novelist, businesswoman, and social benefactor. She was one of the first female industrialists in Britain.

==Biography==
Born in Sketty, Swansea, Dillwyn was a member of a prominent family. Her father was the industrialist and politician Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn, her older sister was the lepidopterist Mary De la Beche Nicholl, her paternal uncle was the botanist and photographer John Dillwyn Llewelyn, her paternal aunt was the photographer Mary Dillwyn, and her paternal first cousin was the astronomer and photographer Thereza Dillwyn Llewelyn. Dillwyn&#x27;s paternal grandfather was the businessman, naturalist, and politician Lewis Weston Dillwyn, while her maternal grandfather was the geologist and palaeontologist Henry De la Beche. Dillwyn&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather was the American abolitionist William Dillwyn, who had migrated to Great Britain.

From the 1870s to the early 1890s, Dillwyn, wrote six novels. Her themes included feminism, social reform, and a favourable view of the Rebecca Riots (1839–1843) in response to unfair taxation. Following her father&#x27;s death in 1892, Dillwyn inherited his spelter works at Llansamlet, and his debts. She personally managed the industry, and by 1899 had fully repaid her father&#x27;s debts. In 1902, she turned her business into a registered company. She joined the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies and campaigned for women&#x27;s suffrage.

Dillwyn never married, but considered herself married to &quot;her wife&quot; Olive Talbot. She was nicknamed &quot;The Pioneer&quot; by friends.

==Family==

Elizabeth Amy Dillwyn was born on 16 May 1845, in Sketty in Swansea, Wales. She was the daughter of Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn and Elizabeth (née De la Beche). She had an older sister and brother, Mary (born 1839) and Henry (born 1843) and a younger sister, Sarah (born 1852).

Her uncle was John Dillwyn Llewelyn of Penllergare who, along with his wife Emma Thomasina Talbot, his sister (Amy&#x27;s aunt) Mary Dillwyn and his daughter (Amy&#x27;s cousin) Theresa Story Maskelyne (née Dillwyn-Llewellyn) were pioneers of early photography. Her paternal grandfather was the naturalist Lewis Weston Dillwyn and her maternal grandfather was the geologist Henry De la Beche. The Dillwyn family were originally Quakers and her great-grandfather was William Dillwyn, the anti-slavery campaigner from Pennsylvania who returned to campaign in Britain.

Her father became a Liberal MP (1855–1892), and was the owner of the Dillwyn Spelter Works at Swansea.

==Biography==
In 1864 her fiancé, Llewelyn Thomas of Llwynmadog, died shortly before their planned wedding. Research into Dillwyn&#x27;s life has also shown a close relationship with Olive Talbot through letters, who she called her &quot;wife&quot; in diaries. From this, some theorise that the unrequited love in her novels was inspired by this real relationship. In 1866 her mother died. Between 1880 and her father&#x27;s death in 1892 she had six novels published.

Following the deaths of her brother in 1890 and her father in 1892 Amy Dillwyn lost the family home at Hendrefoilan due to its being entailed to the male line, but inherited her father&#x27;s debts of over £100,000 (£8 million or more today). She wore a bright purple skirt, with a yellow rose in her belt and flowers in her hat, to her father&#x27;s funeral, in a statement against the Victorian conventions of elaborate funerals, which could cause families to get into debt from buying mourning clothing in haste.

She was able to rescue her father&#x27;s spelter works at Llansamlet, which she managed herself, and thus saved 300 jobs. Dillwyn lived in lodgings until the business was saved, eventually moving into Tŷ Glyn, her home for the rest of her life. It took until 1899 for &quot;Dillwyn &amp; Co&quot;. to pay off the last of its creditors and begin returning a profit. In 1902, Dillwyn registered the business as a registered company.

She was a strong supporter of social justice and gave her support to striking seamstresses. Her unorthodox appearance, her habit of smoking cigars and her lifestyle made her a well-known figure in the local community. When the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies was formed at the turn of the century, Dillwyn joined as one of the earliest supporters in Wales. Although rejecting the militant actions of some members, she was still a staunch member of the movement.

==Death==
Dillwyn died in Swansea on 13 December 1935, at the age of ninety. She was cremated and her ashes buried in the churchyard of St Paul&#x27;s Church, Sketty. Probate was granted to Rice Mansel Dillwyn and her estate was valued at £114,513 7s 9d.

== Legacy ==
Her house, Tŷ Glyn (now Mumbles Nursing Home), still stands at West Cross, Swansea and a Blue plaque has been installed on its boundary wall.

In 2018, Dillwyn (representing women in business) was chosen as one of the top &quot;100 Welsh Women&quot; by Women&#x27;s Equality Network Wales, in their project to mark the centenary of the Representation of the People Act 1918, granting some women the vote.

Amy Dillwyn&#x27;s life has inspired works of art and drama.

== Novels ==
Amy Dillwyn started writing in the 1870s, stating &quot;I&#x27;ve an idea I will try and write one chapter and see how I like it&quot;. &quot;The Rebecca Rioter&quot; (as &quot;The Rebecca Rioter: A Story of Killay Life&quot;) was published by Macmillan in 1880, by &quot;E. A. Dillwyn&quot;. Telling the fictionalised account of a Rebecca rioter, loyal to the cause even when transported to Australia, the novel shows Dillwyn&#x27;s political views, liberal towards the Rebecca rioters and against English rule, despite her father&#x27;s part in squashing the riots. Both &quot;The Rebecca Rioter&quot; and &quot;Chloe Arguelle&quot; were translated as into Russian by members of the liberal intelligentsia. Her novel &quot;Jill&quot; was the most commercially successful, with the original July 1884 print selling out, causing it to be reprinted in September of the same year. She eventually satisfied the reviewers&#x27; calls for a sequel with the 1887 &quot;Jill and Jack&quot;. Bith David Painting and Kirsti Bohata identify recurring themes in her novels of crusading social reform, unrequited love and criticism of the upper classes. Feminist concerns predominate, however, and many of her stories had tomboyish women as protagonists. Dillwyn also anonymously contributed to the &quot;Spectator&quot; regularly in the 1880s.

<text>Guido Molinari L.L. D. (October 12, 1933 – February 21, 2004) was a Canadian artist, known nationally and internationally for his serial abstract paintings and their dynamic interplay of colours and focus on modular shapes. His &quot;Stripe&quot; series is especially celebrated. Molinari himself described their effect - and the effect of all his paintings - as creating a new kind of fictional space &quot;because it happens in the mind and yet also involves the totality of perception&quot;.

== Biography ==
Molinari was born in Montreal, Quebec into a family originally from the Abruzzo region in Italy. He was the son of Charles Molinari (1879–1948), a musician with the Orchestre des concerts symphoniques de Montréal and first
president of the Quebec Musicians&#x27; Association; and of Evelyne Dini (1889–1966),
the daughter of a sculptor so his childhood was culturally rich.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM Foundation/ Chronology&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He began painting at age 13 and later enrolled at the School of the Art Association of Montreal, studying with Marian Dale Scott and Gordon Webber (1948-1951). A year later he contracted tuberculosis. While he was convalescing, he studied existentialism, reading authors such as Sartre, Camus, Piaget and Nietzsche. He did not complete his formal training in art but found his own path.

Early in his career, Molinari read a 1955 article about Jackson Pollock dripping paint onto canvas and went to New York to paint abstractly. He then returned to Montreal where he held his first solo exhibition at L&#x27;Échourie, founded the Galerie L&#x27;Actuelle with Fernande Saint-Martin, his future wife (also in 1955) and was one of the founding members of the Non-Figurative Artists Association in 1956. Between 1963 and 1969, he created hard edge paintings consisting of colour in vertical bands of equal width placed on a flat picture plane called the &quot;Stripe&quot; series. The National Gallery of Canada, acquired a canvas from the series.

Molinari was selected by Lawrence Alloway for the Guggenheim International Award 1964 exhibition. His paintings were seen in New York, Honolulu, Berlin, Ottawa and Buenos Aires. In 1965, his works appeared in &quot;The Responsive Eye&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art in New York along with works by artists such as Frank Stella. They were also seen in &quot;The Deceived Eye&quot; in Fort Worth, Texas; and in a fourth show, a New York solo exhibition at East Hampton Gallery. His work was described by reviewers in glowing terms as &quot;Pop spelled &#x27;Pow!&#x27;— in these handsome paintings the message comes across visually&quot;. 

In 1967, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship and in 1968, the prestigious David Bright Prize at the 34th Biennale di Venezia for which he and Ulysse Comtois had been selected by Brydon Smith. From 1969 to 1970, Molinari created &quot;checkerboard&quot; paintings (he titled them &quot;Structures&quot;) dividing the verticals by the horizontal and in 1971, he began to bisect each stripe, creating a new format of triangles. In the late 1970s, he created the Quantificateur series and, in the years before his death, the Checkerboard paintings (he called them the Continuum series).

Molinari taught for 27 years at Sir George Williams University and Concordia University, retiring in 1997. In 2004, Concordia recognized him with a posthumous honorary doctorate. 

An avid art collector, his extensive private collection included the work of Mondrian and the manuscript pages of Mondrian&#x27;s original defition of Neo-Plasticism (1926), Matisse, John Cage, Jasper Johns, and Quebec artists Denis Juneau, John Lyman, and Ozias Leduc. His obituary in the &quot;National Post&quot; quoted the then director of the Art Gallery of Ontario, Matthew Teitelbaum, as saying he owned Barnett Newman, Richard Serra, Francis Bacon, Piet Mondrian and Ellsworth Kelly.

In 1997, he established the &#x27;Molinari Quartet&#x27; through the Molinari Foundation, a group that has been active now for twenty-five plus years. 

In 2004, Guido Molinari died of pneumonia after having bone cancer which migrated from his lungs. His East Montreal studio at 3290 St. Catherine Street East remains intact and open to the public.

== Selected public exhibitions ==
From 1953, Molinari exhibited his work, primarily in America and Europe. His first solo museum survey was organised by the MacKenzie Art Gallery in Regina in 1964 and toured to the Vancouver Art Gallery. He had exhibitions or was included in group shows in a host of other institutions, including in &quot;Guido Molinari: 1951-1961, Peintures en noir et blanc/ The Black and White Paintings&quot; (1961) curated and catalogue by Gary Dufour which toured Canada; the Guggenheim Museum (Guggenheim International Award show, 1964, and in 1967); the Museum of Modern Art in New York (&quot;The Responsive Eye&quot;, 1965); in &quot;49th Parallels: New Canadian Art&quot; (1971), Ringling Museum of Art curated and catalogue by Dennis Young; at the National Gallery of Canada (retrospective curated and catalogue by Pierre Théberge, 1976); and the Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Montréal (retrospective, 1995).

== Selected works in public collections ==
Molinari&#x27;s work is in national collections and in international collections such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Kunstmuseum Reutlingen concrete.

==Honours and awards==
Molinari won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967, the David Bright Prize at the 34th Venice Biennale (1968), was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1971, received the Victor Martyn Lynch-Staunton Award (1973) and won the Prix Paul-Émile-Borduas in 1980.

<doc id="482516" wikidata="Q375926" url="?curid=482516" title="Rembrandt Peale">
<text>Rembrandt Peale (February 22, 1778 – October 3, 1860) was an American artist and museum keeper. A prolific portrait painter, he was especially acclaimed for his likenesses of presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Peale&#x27;s style was influenced by French neoclassicism after a stay in Paris in his early thirties.

==Early life and education==

Peale was born on February 22, 1778, near present-day Richboro, Pennsylvania, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the third of six surviving children (11 had died) to his mother, Rachel Brewer, and father, Charles Willson Peale, in Bucks County. His father was also a notable artist, and named him after the noted 17th-century Dutch painter and engraver Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn. His father also taught all of his children, including Raphaelle Peale, Rubens Peale, and Titian Peale, to paint scenery and portraiture, and tutored Rembrandt in the arts and sciences.

Rembrandt began drawing at the age of eight. A year after his mother&#x27;s death and the remarriage of his father, Peale left the school of the arts, and completed his first self-portrait at the age of 13. The canvas displays the young artist&#x27;s early mastery. The clothes, however, give the notion that Peale exaggerated what a 13-year-old would look like, and Peale&#x27;s hair curls like the hair of a Renaissance angel. Later in his life, Peale &quot;often showed this painting to young beginners, to encourage them to go from &#x27;bad&#x27; to better...&quot;

==Career==
In July 1787, Charles Willson Peale introduced his son Rembrandt to George Washington, and the young aspirant artist watched his father paint the future president. In 1795, at the age of 17, Rembrandt painted an aging Washington, making him appear far more aged than in reality. The portrait was well received, and Rembrandt had made his debut.

In 1822, Peale moved to New York City, where he embarked on an attempt to paint what he hoped would become the &quot;standard likeness&quot; of Washington. He studied portraits by other artists including John Trumbull, Gilbert Stuart and his own father, as well as his own 1795 picture which had never truly satisfied him. His resulting work &quot;Patriae Pater&quot;, completed in 1824, depicts Washington through an oval window, and is considered by many to be second only to Gilbert Stuart&#x27;s iconic Athenaeum painting of the first president. Peale subsequently attempted to capitalize on the success of what quickly became known as his &quot;Porthole&quot; picture. &quot;Patriae Pater&quot; (Latin for &quot;Father of Our Country&quot;) was purchased by Congress in 1832 for $2,000. It currently hangs in the Old Senate Chamber.

In 1826, he helped found the National Academy of Design in New York City.

Peale went on to create over 70 detailed replicas, including one of Washington in full military uniform that currently hangs in the Oval Office. Peale continued to paint other noted portraits, such as those of the third president Thomas Jefferson while he was in office (1805), and later on a portrait of Chief Justice John Marshall.

===Travels===
Noted for his &quot;itinerant&quot; nature, Peale visited Europe several times to study art (Ward). Throughout his life, Peale traveled across the western hemisphere in search of inspiration and opportunities as an artist. His father helped pay his way to Paris, where he stayed from June to September 1808, and again from October 1809 to November 1810. In Paris, Peale studied the works of Jacques-Louis David, which influenced him to paint in the Neoclassical style. He painted the famous explorer Alexander von Humboldt and several other noted patrons such as Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and François André Michaux. After his successes in France, Peale returned to Philadelphia in 1810.
His efforts to establish his knowledge and mastery of art were displayed in his painting &quot;The Roman Daughter&quot; (1811). The painting depicts a young girl shielding her father, a prisoner in chains, and feeding him from her breast, the emblem of &quot;Roman Charity&quot; reported in the pages of Pliny. It was deemed too &quot;sensational&quot; by the people of Philadelphia, who were unsympathetic to his endeavors toward &quot;improving the state of fine arts in America&quot; in the 19th century. Amid the economic hardship of the War of 1812, President Jefferson—who promised to buy the 1795 portrait of Washington, but could not keep his promise—instead encouraged Peale to go to Europe, as &quot;we have genius among us but no unemployed wealth to reward it&quot;.

===Peale&#x27;s Baltimore Museum===

Motivated by his father&#x27;s establishment of the Philadelphia Museum (1786) and having been unsuccessful in Philadelphia, Rembrandt Peale assumed his father&#x27;s role in another city. On August 15, 1814, Peale launched his first museum as soon as he arrived in the municipality of Baltimore, Maryland on Holliday Street between East Saratoga and Lexington Streets, the first building constructed in America to serve as a museum. It later served as the second Baltimore City Hall, 1830–1875; a &quot;Colored&quot; primary, grammar, and high school, part of Baltimore&#x27;s segregated public school system, 1878–1889; and was restored in 1931 as the Municipal Museum of the City of Baltimore. Renovated and restored again in 1981, it reopened with a groundbreaking interpretive history exhibition, &quot;Rowhouse: A Baltimore Style of Living.&quot; In 1985, the Municipal Museum, which had grown to five sites (Peale Museum, Carroll Mansion, 1840 House, Baltimore Center for Urban Archaeology, and H.L. Mencken House) was renamed Baltimore City Life Museums. It closed in 1997, a year after opening a new 30,000sf exhibition center.

The museum was elaborately illuminated by gas light, following the example of his brother Rubens in Philadelphia. This innovation made a great impression. Peale had acquired an important gas lighting patent, and with some associates founded the successful Gas Light Company of Baltimore. Having poor business sense, though, he did little to manage the company and was forced out after a few years due to the War of 1812.

In 1828, an ambitious Peale raised funds and tried earning money for his previous paintings, in order to travel to Rome. He took along his 15-year-old son, Michael Angelo, a determined young artist who copied his father&#x27;s paintings in admiration. Peale successfully displayed portraits of Horatio Greenough and Washington as &quot;Patriæ Pater&quot; in the Florentine academy.
In the last years of his life, Peale published memories of his life and travels as a series in &quot;The Crayon&quot;, an arts periodical. At the age of 82, Peale died on October 3, 1860, at his house on 1506 Vine St in Philadelphia. He is buried at Woodlands Cemetery in West Philadelphia.

===Works===
Exhibited and discussed in &quot;In Pursuit of Fame: Rembrandt Peale 1778–1860,&quot; Washington D.C., National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian institution, 1992–93, The portrait of Margaret Irvine Miller exemplifies Peale&#x27;s ability to convey a story and capture character through taking liberty with the way in which he portrayed his sitters. Mrs. Miller, by birth working-class, later raised her position in Philadelphia society. Though her clothing is aristocratic, Mrs. Miller&#x27;s pose and gaze are those of a straightforward, working-class woman. The subtle juxtaposition is masterfully captured in the finest of terms.
In 1801, Peale painted a portrait of his brother Rubens, youngest of the six Peale children, who always had an admiration for gardening and tending to natural life. Peale seated his brother next to a geranium. The painting signifies the artist&#x27;s admiration for a sibling&#x27;s love of nature, and may have been inspired by the Dutch 17th-century artist, David Teniers the Younger, who had painted a series of oil-on-copper paintings representing the five senses. His painting, &quot;Smell&quot; is quite similar to Rembrandt Peale&#x27;s. Rembrandt&#x27;s piece captures the essence of a young gardener/artist&#x27;s peace of mind, gracefully looking out, a posture of wonder and calmness.

In 1824, Peale painted the &quot;Patriæ Pater&quot;, in which a rectangle supporting an oval wreath surrounds the eye-catching image of George Washington. The most successful painting of Peale&#x27;s 50-year career, it inspired John Marshall to have his portrait done by Peale in the same fashion. The painting was criticized as lacking authenticity, as it was not completed until after Washington&#x27;s death (1799). Nonetheless, Peale received commendations for his portrait by many noted politicians such as Washington&#x27;s nephew, Judge Bushrod Washington, who was an associate U.S. Supreme Court Justice, and Marshall.

Peale&#x27;s neoclassical painting &quot;The Roman Daughter&quot; demonstrates compassion and graceful defense; his copy of Correggio&#x27;s Angel, and his immense allegorical painting, &quot;Court of Death&quot; (1820), reveal the same artistic style.

==Personal life==
At the age of 20, Peale married 22-year-old Eleanor May Short (1776–1836) at St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church in Philadelphia. During their marriage, Peale and Short had nine children: Rosalba, Eleanor, Michael Angelo, Angelica, and Emma Clara among them. In 1840, he married Harriet Cany (1799–1869), one of his pupils and an artist in her own right.

==Legacy==
Rembrandt Peale completed more than 600 paintings. He painted portraits of many notable people, including American presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, Chief Justice John Marshall, and John C. Calhoun. His paintings are in many public collections.

==A portrait identified==
A painting of a comedian who was an acquaintance of the British painter George Clint—an artist whose style resembled Peale&#x27;s, and who claimed the picture as his own—was examined by the National Portrait Gallery of London in 1914. It was initially confirmed as Clint&#x27;s artwork. Later, the gallery further examined the history behind the painting: the English comedian, Charles Mathews, had arrived in New York in 1822, and left shortly after Peale had welcomed him for a portrait painting.

<doc id="482517" wikidata="Q1506018" url="?curid=482517" title="Westray">
<text>Westray (, ) is one of the Orkney Islands in Scotland, with a usual resident population of just under 600 people. Its main village is Pierowall, with a heritage centre, the 15th-century Lady Kirk church and pedestrian ferry service to nearby Papa Westray island. Westray has a number of archeological sites dating from 3500 BC, and remains of several Norse-Viking settlements. The spectacular sea cliffs around Noup Head are home to thousands of seabirds.

==Geography and geology==
Westray has an area of , making it the sixth largest of the Orkney Islands. The underlying geology is Rousay-type Middle Old Red Sandstone, the flagstones of which make excellent building materials. There is very little peat and the soil is noted for its fertility.

==History==
At the time of the earliest known settlements, c. 3500 BC, in Westray and neighbouring Papa Westray, it is believed that the two islands were joined. A Neolithic and Bronze Age site at the Links of Noltland is in the care of Historic Scotland. The site is threatened by the rapid erosion of the overlying sand dunes. Ongoing excavations have revealed over 30 buildings of Neolithic and Bronze Age date, the earliest of which overlaps in use with the Knap of Howar on the neighbouring island of Papa Westray (known as Papay to the locals), the oldest standing structure in NW Europe. The Westray Wife, 4 cm carved Neolithic figurine was discovered on the Noltland dig in 2009; this is the oldest carving of a human found in the British Isles.

In 2010 some local businesses reported a 45% increase in turnover since the discovery of the figurine. Since then, four further figurines have been found, together with a wealth of other artefacts (carved stone ball, decorated grooved ware pottery, numerous carved bone objects and beads etc.). In 2015, a substantial subterranean building dating from the Bronze Age was uncovered; this was very well preserved and is interpreted as a sauna. The excavations won &#x27;Best Rescue Dig&#x27; of the year in the prestigious 2014 Current Archaeology awards. Several of the figurines and other artefacts from the site can be seen at Westray Heritage Centre and the excavation is open seasonally (free of charge). The Heritage Centre also exhibits the &#x27;Westray Stone&#x27; - a neolithic carved stone from a chambered tomb which closely resembles the art style of the Boyne Valley in Ireland.
Westray constituted a major family estate during the saga period of the 10th - 11th centuries. Largescale excavations of Norse period sites have been undertaken at Tuquoy, Quoygrew and Langskaill in recent years. Each of these was the site of a Viking-Norse settlement. Tuquoy has remains of a longhouse, a large rectangular building, and a midden (refuse dump). Quoygrew (Scheduled Monument SM13504) has the remains of a longhouse dating from 1100AD, used continuously until the early 20th century. Langskaill appears to have been an Iron Age settlement in use from 500 BC to the 14th century. An underground chamber was discovered in Langskaill farm in 1965. The investigation appears to indicate the abrupt disappearance of the pre-Norse culture, indicating an invasion by force by the Vikings. The Norse invaders built a large high-status settlement over the site of the earlier settlement.

It was at Noltland on Westray too, that one of the most impressive castles in Orkney, and indeed the Northern Isles, was built, Noltland Castle. The castle was commissioned in the 1560s by Gilbert Balfour, who probably played the leading role in the murder of Lord Darnley, consort of Mary, Queen of Scots. Balfour married Margaret Bothwell, the sister of Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney who endowed him with Westray, when it was episcopal property. The Castle is situated above the Bay of Pierowall, was built in the 1560s. It is notable for an unusually large spiral staircase, &quot;second only to Fyvie Castle, while its triple tiers of gunloops are without parallel in Scotland, if not Europe&quot;. However, Balfour was executed by the Swedes before he could use it.

Other attractions include the Romanesque Cross Kirk and the Castle O&#x27;Burrian sea stack once used as a hermitage. Noup Head Lighthouse was constructed in 1898.

==Wildlife==

The spectacular sea cliffs around Noup Head are home to thousands of seabirds including 60,000 common guillemot and black-legged kittiwake, 30,000 razorbill and numerous Atlantic puffin and black guillemot. The cliffs along the western and northern coasts of the island, along with adjoining areas of grassland and maritime sedge-heath, have been designated as Important Bird Areas (IBAs) by BirdLife International because they support breeding seabirds and waterbirds, while the sandy bays of the southern coast support wintering waders.

During the 1990s the black rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;) may have been present although they have not been recorded since. Mice and the Orkney vole are present however, as are European otters.

==Economy and infrastructure==
Flights leave the island&#x27;s Westray Airport at Aikerness for Kirkwall on the Orkney Mainland, and to Papa Westray in the world&#x27;s shortest scheduled flight, of two minutes. The main ferry terminal is at Rapness with regular sailings by Orkney Ferries to Kirkwall.

The island&#x27;s main industries are fishing, fish farming and cattle farming. Tourism is also important to the island economy. The local cheese, Westray Wife, is an organic unpasteurised cheese available in mild and mature varieties. It marries well with the local range of Westray chutneys (all Fairtrade) and bakery goods (including oatcakes). Fresh fish, seafood and lobster is available and is of a very high standard.

The Westray Development Trust is well known for its renewable energy and recycling initiatives and plans to make the island self-sufficient in energy by 2012. A 900 kW community-owned wind turbine was erected in October 2009, the third large-scale such project in Scotland. &quot;When the community realised it was their turbine, not someone else’s, there was no objection,&quot; stated Alasdair McVicar of Westray Renewable Energy.

<text>Ayutthaya Historical Park ( (Pronunciation)) covers the ruins of the old city of Ayutthaya, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province, Thailand. The city of Ayutthaya was founded by King Ramathibodi I in 1351, though it is likely to be significantly older, based on evidence showing that the area was already populated during the Mon Dvaravati period. Sources further mention that around 850 AD, the Khmers occupied the area and established a stronghold there, naming it Ayodhya, after one of the holiest Hindu cities in India of the same name. The early history of Ayutthaya is connected to this Khmer settlement. Additionally, Prince Damrong has also attested to the existence of a city named Ayodhya, founded by the Khmers ruling from Lopburi at the point where the three rivers meet. An excavation map shows traces of an ancient baray (water reservoir) close to the southwestern tip of Wat Yai Chai Mongkhon, which could have been built on a former important Khmer temple complex.

The city was captured by the Burmese in 1569. Though not pillaged, it lost &quot;many valuable and artistic objects.&quot; It was the capital of the country until its destruction by the Burmese army in 1767.

In 1969, the Fine Arts Department of Thailand began renovations of the ruins, scaling up the project after the site was declared a historical park in 1976. Part of the park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991.

<doc id="482522" wikidata="Q65205" url="?curid=482522" title="Carl Wilhelm Borchardt">
<text>Carl Wilhelm Borchardt (22 February 1817 – 27 June 1880) was a German mathematician.

Borchardt was born to a Jewish family in Berlin. His father, Moritz, was a respected merchant, and his mother was Emma Heilborn. Borchardt studied under a number of tutors, including Julius Plücker and Jakob Steiner. He studied at the University of Berlin under Lejeune Dirichlet in 1836 and at the University of Königsberg in 1839. In 1848 he began teaching at the University of Berlin.

He did research in the area of the arithmetic-geometric mean, continuing work by Gauss and Lagrange. He generalised the results of Kummer on diagonalising symmetric matrices, using determinants and Sturm functions. He was also an editor of &quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot; from 1856 to 1880, during which time it was known as &quot;Borchardt&#x27;s Journal&quot;.

He died in Rüdersdorf, Germany. His grave is preserved in the Protestant &quot;Friedhof III der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde&quot; (Cemetery No. III of the congregations of Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor.

<text>Nikolay Yakovlevich Sonin (Russian: Никола́й Я́ковлевич Со́нин, February 22, 1849 – February 27, 1915) was a Russian mathematician.

== Biography ==
He was born in Tula and attended Lomonosov University, studying mathematics and physics there from 1865 to 1869. His advisor was Nikolai Bugaev. He obtained a master&#x27;s degree with a thesis submitted in 1871, then he taught at the University of Warsaw where he obtained a doctorate in 1874. He was appointed to a chair in the University of Warsaw in 1876. In 1894, Sonin moved to St. Petersburg, where he taught at the University for Women.

Sonin worked on special functions, in particular cylindrical functions. For instance, the Sonine formula is a formula given by Sonin for the integral of the product of three Bessel functions. He is furthermore credited with the introduction of the associated Laguerre polynomials. He also contributed to the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula.

Other topics Sonin studied include Bernoulli polynomials and approximate computation of definite integrals, continuing Chebyshev&#x27;s work on numerical integration. Together with Andrey Markov, Sonin prepared a two volume edition of Chebyshev&#x27;s works in French and Russian. He died in St. Petersburg.

<doc id="482527" wikidata="Q4668273" url="?curid=482527" title="Abolitionist Party of Canada">
<text>The Abolitionist Party of Canada was a Canadian political party founded by perennial candidate John Turmel. The party ran on a platform of monetary reform, including the abolition of interest rates and the income tax; the use of the local employment trading system of banking; and introducing a form of Social Credit with monthly dividends being paid out to each Canadian.

Unlike many Canadian social credit parties, the Abolitionists were not social conservatives, advocating, for instance, the legalization of marijuana and gambling.

Turmel attempted to run for the leadership of the national Social Credit party after the resignation of Fabien Roy in 1981, but the party chose to appoint Martin Hattersley instead. In 1982, Turmel founded the Christian Credit Party, which he disbanded in 1983.

Turmel founded the Abolitionist Party in 1993 with a similar program to that of the Christian Credit Party. The Abolitionist Party nominated 80 candidates in the 1993 federal election, who collected only 9,141 votes between them. &quot;(See also: Abolitionist Party candidates, 1993 Canadian federal election.)&quot; The Abolitionist Party subsequently reverted to being a personal vehicle for Turmel.

In 2003, Turmel attempted to organize a new party using the name of the defunct Libertarian Party of Canada, but was prevented from doing so by old members of the Libertarian Party who registered the name.

<text>A spirometer is an apparatus for measuring the volume of air inspired and expired by the lungs. A spirometer measures ventilation, the movement of air into and out of the lungs. The spirogram will identify two different types of abnormal ventilation patterns, obstructive and restrictive. There are various types of spirometers that use a number of different methods for measurement (pressure transducers, ultrasonic, water gauge).

==Pulmonary function tests==

A spirometer is the main piece of equipment used for basic Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs). Lung diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema may be ruled out from the tests. In addition, a spirometer often is used for finding the cause of shortness of breath, assessing the effect of contaminants on lung function, the effect of medication, and evaluating progress for disease treatment.

==Reasons for testing==
* Diagnose certain types of lung disease (such as COVID-19, bronchitis, and emphysema)
* Find the cause of shortness of breath
* Measure whether exposure to chemicals at work affects lung function
* Check lung function before someone has surgery
* Assess the effect of medication
* Measure progress in disease treatment

==History==
===Early development===
The earliest attempt to measure lung volume can be dated back to the period A.D. 129–200. Claudius Galen, a Roman physician and philosopher, did a volumetric experiment on human ventilation. He had a child breathe in and out of a bladder and found that the volume did not change. The experiment proved inconclusive.

* 1681, Giovanni Alfonso Borelli tried to measure the volume of air inspired in one breath. He assembled a cylindrical tube partially filled with water, with an open water source entering the bottom of the cylinder. He occluded his nostrils, inhaled through an outlet at the top of the cylinder and measured the volume of air displaced by water. Nowadays, this technique is very important in determining parameters of lung volume.

===Nineteenth century===
* 1813, Edward Kentish used a simple &quot;Pulmometer&quot; to study the effect of diseases on pulmonary lung volume. He used an inverted graduated bell jar standing in water, with an outlet at the top of the bell jar controlled by a tap. The volume of air was measured in units of pints.
* 1831, Charles Thackrah described a &quot;Pulmometer&quot; similar to that of Kentish. He portrayed the device as a bell jar with an opening for the air to enter from below. There was no correction for pressure. Therefore, the spirometer not only measured the respiratory volume, but also the strength of the respiratory muscles.
* 1845, Karl von Vierordt in his book entitled &quot;Physiologie des Athmens mit besonderer Rücksicht auf die Auscheidung der Kohlensäure&quot; discussed his interest in measuring the volume of expiration accurately. He also completed accurate measures of other volume parameters by using his &quot;Expirator&quot;. Some of the parameters he described are used today, including residual volume and vital capacity.
* 1846 The water spirometer measuring vital capacity was developed by a surgeon named John Hutchinson. He invented a calibrated bell inverted in water, which was used to capture the volume of air exhaled by a person. Hutchinson published his paper about his water spirometer and the measurements he had taken from more than 4,000 subjects, describing the direct relationship between vital capacity and height and the inverse relationship between vital capacity and age. He also showed that vital capacity does not relate to weight at any given height. Hutchinson is regarded as the inventor of vital capacity because he found that with every inch of height vital capacity increased by eight cubic inches. He also used his machine for the prediction of premature mortality. He coined the term &#x27;vital capacity&#x27;, which was claimed as a powerful prognosis for heart disease by the Framingham study. He believed that his machine should be used for actuarial predictions for companies selling life insurance.
*1854 Dr. M. Alton Wintrich developed a spirometer, which was easier to use than Hutchinson&#x27;s. He did an experiment with 4,000 subjects and concluded that there are three parameters affecting vital capacity: height, weight, and age. His experiment produced results similar to those of Hutchinson&#x27;s study.
*1859 E. Smith developed a portable spirometer, which he used to measure gas metabolism.
*1866 Henry Hyde Salter (1823-1871) added a kymograph to the spirometer in order to record time while obtaining air volumes.
*1879 Gad J. published a paper entitled &quot;Pneumatograph&quot; that described a machine that allowed the recording of lung volume changes.

===Twentieth century===
*1902, Brodie T. G. was the first to use a dry-bellowed wedge spirometer
*1904 Tissot introduced the closed-circuit spirometer
*1939 Compton S. D. developed the lungometer for use by Nazi Germany
*1959 Wright B. M. and McKerrow C. B. introduced the peak flow meter
*1969 DuBois A. B. and van de Woestijne K. P. experimented on humans using the whole body plethysmograph
*1974 Campbell et al. refined the previous peak flow meter, developing a cheaper and lighter version

===Interpreting Spirometry===
Even with the numerical precision that a spirometer can provide, determining pulmonary function relies on differentiating the abnormal from the normal. Measurements of lung function can vary both within and among groups of people, individuals, and spirometer devices. Lung capacity, for instance, may vary temporally, increasing and then decreasing in one person&#x27;s lifetime. As a result, ideas about what constitutes &quot;normal&quot; are based on one&#x27;s understanding about the sources of variabilities and can be left to interpretation.

Traditionally, sources of variation have been understood in discrete categories, such as age, height, weight, gender, geographical region (altitude), and race or ethnicity. Global efforts were made in the early twentieth century to standardize these sources to enable proper diagnosis and accurate evaluation of pulmonary function. However, rather than further aiming to understand the causes of such variations, the primary approach for dealing with observed differences in lung capacity has been to &quot;correct for&quot; them. Using results from comparative population studies, attributes are empirically factored together into a &quot;correction factor&quot;. This number is then used to form a personalized &#x27;reference value&#x27; that defines what is considered normal for one individual. Practitioners may thereby find the percent deviation from this predicted value, known as &#x27;percent of predicted,’ and determine whether someone’s lung function is abnormally poor or excellent.

In particular, &#x27;race correction&#x27; or &#x27;ethnic adjustment&#x27; effectively has been computer-programmed into the modern-day spirometer. Preconceived notions that &#x27;white&#x27; people have greater pulmonary function are embedded in spirometer measurement interpretation and have only been reinforced through this medical stereotyping. In the United States, spirometers use correction factors of 10-15% for those identified as &#x27;black&#x27; and 4-6% for those identified as &#x27;Asian.&#x27;

====Standard Guidelines====
In 1960, the European Community for Coal and Steel (ECCS) first recommended guidelines for spirometry. The organization then published predicted values for parameters such as spirometric indices, residual volume, total lung capacity, and functional residual capacity in 1971. The American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society also recommends race-specific reference values when available. Even today, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s Spirometry Training Guide that is linked to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website notes the use of race correction and a race-specific reference value in step four of &quot;normal&quot; spirometry.

====Motivations====
The use of reference values and discrete categorizations of sources of variability has been motivated by ideas of anthropometry and vital capacity. Studies have looked specifically at the relationship between anthropometric variables and lung function parameters.

====Implications====
The use of reference values has thus far not accounted for the social labelling of race and ethnicity. Often, determinations are subjective or silently ascribed by a practitioner. Another concern of using reference values is misdiagnosis. This was an important factor in the management and control of compensation for miners in Britain in the interwar period. In this politically loaded context, in which new X-ray technology could not be fully trusted, the spirometer represented secure evidence of respiratory disease in numerical terms that could be used in the complex compensation network.

Evaluation of vital capacity has influenced other sectors of life other than medicine as well, including evaluation of life insurance applicants and diagnosis of tuberculosis.

Regarding gender, some population studies have indicated no difference based on gender. Notably, spirometers have been used to evaluate vital capacity in India since 1929, recording a statistically significant difference between males (21.8 mL/cm) and females (18 mL/cm). Additionally, by 1990, around half of pulmonary training programs in both the United States and Canada adjusted for race and ethnicity.

The spirometer popularized notions of &#x27;race corrections&#x27; and &#x27;ethnic adjustments,&#x27; which suggested that black individuals have weaker lungs than white individuals. For example, Thomas Jefferson noted physical distinctions between different races such as a &#x27;difference in the structure of the pulmonary apparatus,&#x27; which made black individuals &#x27;more tolerant of heat and less so of cold, than the whites.&#x27; Jefferson&#x27;s theories encouraged speculation on the natural conditioning of blacks for agricultural labor on southern plantations in the U.S. Samuel Cartwright, a slavery apologist and plantation owner, used the spirometer to make the claim that black people consumed less oxygen than white people in addition to racial &#x27;peculiarities&#x27; he laid out in the &quot;New Orleans Medical and Surgical Journal&quot; that described racial differences in the respiratory system and the implication of them on labor.

South African studies also used the spirometer to address racial and class differences. Eustace H. Cluver conducted vital capacity measurement research at the University of Witwatersrand and found that poor white people had physical unfitness but that it was attributable to environmental issues rather than genetics. Using these studies, Cluver argued to the South African Association for the Advancement of Science during World War Two that improving both nutrition and physical training programs could help produce wealth and win the war by increasing the working capacity of individuals across all races as their labor was necessary to achieve these ends. Racism and the spirometer intersected again in these studies when further research was conducted on the effects of physical training on poor white recruits; vital capacity studies showed that &#x27;the poor-white is biologically sound and can be turned into a valuable citizen&#x27; but no comment was made on the outcome of black South Africans.

Beyond the United States and South Africa, the spirometer was used in racial studies in India in the 1920s. Researchers found that the vital capacity of Indians was smaller than that of Westerners.

====Altering interpretations====
Many have questioned whether the current standards are sufficient and accurate. As a multiethnic society develops, racial and ethnic origin as a factor becomes more and more problematic to utilize. Ideas connecting ethnicity to lack of nutrition and birthplace in a poor country become invalid as people immigrate to or may be born in richer nations.

==Types of spirometer==

===Whole body plethysmograph===

This type of spirometer gives a more accurate measurement for the components of lung volumes as compared to other conventional spirometers. A person is enclosed in a small space when the measurement is taken.

===Pneumotachometer===
This spirometer measures the flow rate of gases by detecting pressure differences across fine mesh. One advantage of this spirometer is that the subject can breathe fresh air during the experiment.

===Fully electronic spirometer===
Electronic spirometers have been developed that compute airflow rates in a channel without the need for fine meshes or moving parts. They operate by measuring the speed of the airflow with techniques such as ultrasonic transducers, or by measuring pressure difference in the channel. These spirometers have greater accuracy by eliminating the momentum and resistance errors associated with moving parts such as windmills or flow valves for flow measurement. They also allow improved hygiene by allowing fully disposable air flow channels.

===Incentive spirometer===

This spirometer is specially designed to encourage improvement of one&#x27;s lung function.

===Peak flow meter===

This device is useful for measuring how well a person&#x27;s lungs expel air.

===Windmill-type spirometer===
This type of spirometer is used especially for measuring forced vital capacity without using water; it has broad measurements ranging from 1000 ml to 7000 ml. It is more portable and lighter than traditional water-tank type spirometers. This spirometer should be held horizontally while taking measurements because of the presence of a rotating disc.

===Vitalograph ===
This instrument is used to measure vital capacity. It has a double walled metallic cylindrical chamber filled with water between two cylinders.

<text>The Ecologist Greens (, &#x27;,OP) is a Greek green political party. It is a member of the European Green Party.

== History ==
The political party Prasini Politiki (, &quot;Green Politics&quot;), the body that lead to the establishment of the party under the name &quot;Oikologoi Prasinoi&quot;, was founded in 1996 and already registered as the Greek member of the European Green Party, including other local ecological groups and independent ecologists, like the Ecological Forum (Οικολογικό Φόρουμ) and the Ecological Movement of Thessaloniki.

During 7–8 December 2002, the &quot;Prasini Politiki&quot; council called for a conference that convened in the building of the Athens Lawyer Association, and it decided to establish the Ecologist Greens and elected an 18-member council to coordinate the establishment of a new political entity. In the coming months, focus groups were created to shape the constitution and the political positions of the body, which were adopted by the first congress of the party in May 2003 at Panteion University.

In January 2015, the Ecologist Greens decided to collaborate with SYRIZA. Alexis Tsipras&#x27; called for unity against the Memorandum and the Ecologist Greens decided to support SYRIZA&#x27;s electoral list for the upcoming legislative election. One Ecologist Green MP was elected on the SYRIZA ticket, Giorgos Dimaras, and another Ecologist Green, Giannis Tsironis, was appointed Alternate Minister of Environment and Energy in the first Tsipras Cabinet.

Giorgos Dimaras was reelected and Giannis Tsironis was elected for the first time. Tsironis was reappointed as Alternate Minister of Environment in the second Tsipras cabinet on 23 September 2015.

== Aims ==
The basic principles of the Ecologists Greens (Oikologoi Prasinoi), as determined by their constitution are: sustainability, social justice, nonviolence, direct and participatory democracy, respect for diversity, decentralization and subsidiarity, protect and restore natural ecosystems, the quality of life, personal and social responsibility, equity and anti-austerity.

<doc id="482534" wikidata="Q410352" url="?curid=482534" title="Gabapentin">
<text>Gabapentin, sold under the brand name Neurontin among others, is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used to treat neuropathic pain and also for partial seizures of epilepsy. It is a commonly used medication for the treatment of neuropathic pain caused by diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and central pain. It is moderately effective: about 30–40% of those given gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia have a meaningful benefit.
Gabapentin, like other gabapentinoid drugs, acts by decreasing activity of the α2δ-1 protein, coded by the CACNA2D1 gene, first known as an auxiliary subunit of voltage gated calcium channels. However, see Pharmacodynamics, below. By binding to α2δ-1, gabapentin reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters (primarily glutamate) and as a result, reduces excess excitation of neuronal networks in the spinal cord and brain. Sleepiness and dizziness are the most common side effects. Serious side effects include respiratory depression, and allergic reactions. As with all other antiepileptic drugs approved by the FDA, gabapentin is labeled for an increased risk of suicide. Lower doses are recommended in those with kidney disease. 
Gabapentin was first approved for use in the United Kingdom in 1993. It has been available as a generic medication in the United States since 2004. It is the first of several other drugs that are similar in structure and mechanism, called gabapentinoids. In 2022, it was the tenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 40million prescriptions. During the 1990s, Parke-Davis, a subsidiary of Pfizer, used a number of illegal techniques to encourage physicians in the United States to prescribe gabapentin for unapproved uses. They have paid out millions of dollars to settle lawsuits regarding these activities.

==Medical uses==
Gabapentin is recommended for use in focal seizures and neuropathic pain. Gabapentin is prescribed off-label in the US and the UK, for example, for the treatment of non-neuropathic pain, anxiety disorders, sleep problems and bipolar disorder. In recent years, gabapentin has seen increased use, particularly in the elderly. There is concern regarding gabapentin&#x27;s off-label use due to the lack of strong scientific evidence for its efficacy in multiple conditions, its proven side effects and its potential for misuse and physical/psychological dependency. Some harms, including nervous system harms, have been underreported in published trials of gabapentin, potentially resulting in the underestimation of harms in guidelines for the use of gabapentin.

===Seizures===
Gabapentin is approved for the treatment of focal seizures; however, it is not effective for generalized epilepsy.

===Neuropathic pain===
Gabapentin is recommended as a first-line treatment for chronic neuropathic pain by various medical authorities. This is a general recommendation applicable to all neuropathic pain syndromes except for trigeminal neuralgia, where it may be used as a second- or third-line agent.

Regarding the specific diagnoses, a systematic review has found evidence for gabapentin to provide pain relief for some people with postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy. Gabapentin is approved for the former indication in the US. In addition to these two neuropathies, European Federation of Neurological Societies guideline notes gabapentin effectiveness for central pain. A combination of gabapentin with an opioid or nortriptyline may work better than either drug alone.

Gabapentin shows substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or a patient global impression of change (PGIC) &quot;very much improved&quot;) for neuropathic pain (postherpetic neuralgia or peripheral diabetic neuropathy) in 30–40% of subjects treated as compared to those treated with placebo.

Evidence finds little or no benefit and significant risk in those with chronic low back pain or sciatica. Gabapentin is not effective in HIV-associated sensory neuropathy and neuropathic pain due to cancer.

===Anxiety===
There is a small amount of research on the use of gabapentin for the treatment of anxiety disorders.

Gabapentin is effective for the long-term treatment of social anxiety disorder and in reducing preoperative anxiety.

In a controlled trial of breast cancer survivors with anxiety, and a trial for social phobia, gabapentin significantly reduced anxiety levels.

For panic disorder, gabapentin has produced mixed results.

===Sleep===
Gabapentin is effective in treating sleep disorders such as insomnia and restless legs syndrome that are the result of an underlying illness, but comes with some risk of discontinuation and withdrawal symptoms after prolonged use at higher doses.

Gabapentin enhances slow-wave sleep in people with primary insomnia. It also improves sleep quality by elevating sleep efficiency and decreasing spontaneous arousal.

===Drug dependence===
Gabapentin is moderately effective in reducing the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and associated craving. The evidence in favor of gabapentin is weak in the treatment of alcoholism: it does not contribute to the achievement of abstinence, and the data on the relapse of heavy drinking and percent of days abstinent do not robustly favor gabapentin; it only decreases the percent days of heavy drinking.

Gabapentin is ineffective in cocaine dependence and methamphetamine use, and it does not increase the rate of smoking cessation. While some studies indicate that gabapentin does not significantly reduce the symptoms of opiate withdrawal, there is increasing evidence that gabapentinoids are effective in controlling some of the symptoms during opiate detoxification. A clinical study in Iran, where heroin dependence is a significant social and public health problem, showed gabapentin produced positive results during an inpatient therapy program, particularly by reducing opioid-induced hyperalgesia and drug craving. There is insufficient evidence for its use in cannabis dependence.

===Other===
Gabapentin is recommended as a first-line treatment of the acquired pendular nystagmus, torsional nystagmus, and infantile nystagmus; however, it does not work in periodic alternating nystagmus.

Gabapentin decreases the frequency of hot flashes in both menopausal women and people with breast cancer. However, antidepressants have similar efficacy, and treatment with estrogen more effectively prevents hot flashes.

Gabapentin reduces spasticity in multiple sclerosis and is prescribed as one of the first-line options. It is an established treatment of restless legs syndrome. Gabapentin alleviates itching in kidney failure (uremic pruritus) and itching of other causes. It may be an option in essential or orthostatic tremor.

Gabapentin does not appear to provide benefit for bipolar disorder, complex regional pain syndrome, post-surgical pain, or tinnitus, or prevent episodic migraine in adults.

==Contraindications==
Gabapentin should be used carefully and at lower doses in people with kidney problems due to possible accumulation and toxicity. It is unclear if it is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

==Side effects==

Dizziness and somnolence are the most frequent side effects. Fatigue, ataxia, peripheral edema (swelling of extremities), and nystagmus are also common. A 2017 meta-analysis found that gabapentin also increased the risk of difficulties in mentation and visual disturbances as compared to a placebo. Gabapentin is associated with a weight gain of after 1.5 months of use. Case studies indicate that it may cause anorgasmia and erectile dysfunction, as well as myoclonus that disappear after discontinuing gabapentin or replacing it with other medication. Fever, swollen glands that do not go away, eyes or skin turning yellow, unusual bruises or bleeding, unexpected muscle pain or weakness, rash, long-lasting stomach pain which may indicate an inflamed pancreas, hallucinations, anaphylaxis, respiratory depression, and increased suicidal ideation are rare but serious side effects.

===Suicide===
As with all antiepileptic drugs approved in the US, gabapentin label contains a warning of an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. This warning is based on a meta-analysis of all approved antiepileptic drugs in 2008, and not with gabapentin alone. According to an experimental meta-analysis of insurance claims database, gabapentin use is associated with about 40% increased risk of suicide, suicide attempt and violent death as compared with a reference anticonvulsant drug topiramate. The risk is increased for people with bipolar disorder or epilepsy. Another study has shown an approximately doubled rate of suicide attempts and self-harm in people with bipolar disorder who are taking gabapentin versus those taking lithium. A large Swedish study suggests that gabapentinoids are associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses, head/body injuries, and road traffic incidents and offences. On the other hand, a study published by the Harvard Data Science Review found that gabapentin was associated with a significantly reduced rate of suicide.

===Respiratory depression===
Serious breathing suppression, potentially fatal, may occur when gabapentin is taken together with opioids, benzodiazepines, or other depressants, or by people with underlying lung problems such as COPD. Gabapentin and opioids are commonly prescribed or abused together, and research indicates that the breathing suppression they cause is additive. For example, gabapentin use before joint replacement or laparoscopic surgery increased the risk of respiratory depression by 30–60%. A Canadian study showed that use of gabapentin and other gabapentinoids, whether for epilepsy, neuropathic pain or other chronic pain was associated with a 35–58% increased risk for severe exacerbation of pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

===Withdrawal and dependence===
Withdrawal symptoms typically occur 1–2 days after abruptly stopping gabapentin (almost unambiguously due to extended use and during a very short-term rebound phenomenon) similar to, albeit less intense than most benzodiazepines. Agitation, confusion and disorientation are the most frequently reported, followed by gastrointestinal complaints and sweating, and more rare tremor, tachycardia, hypertension and insomnia. In some cases, users experience withdrawal seizures after chronic or semi-chronic use in the absence of periodic cycles or breaks during repeating and consecutive use. All these symptoms subside when gabapentin is re-instated or tapered off gradually at an appropriate rate.

On its own, gabapentin appears to not have a substantial addictive power. In human and animal experiments, it shows limited to no rewarding effects. The vast majority of people abusing gabapentin are current or former abusers of opioids or sedatives. In these persons, gabapentin can boost the opioid &quot;high&quot; as well as decrease commonly experienced opioid-withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety.

==Overdose==
Through excessive ingestion, accidental or otherwise, persons may experience overdose symptoms including drowsiness, sedation, blurred vision, slurred speech, somnolence, uncontrollable jerking motions, and anxiety. A very high amount taken is associated with breathing suppression, coma, and possibly death, particularly if combined with alcohol or opioids.

==Pharmacology==

=== Animal Models ===
Gabapentin, prevents seizures in a dose-related manner in several laboratory animal models. These models include spinal extensor seizures from low-intensity electroshock to the forebrain in mice, maximal electroshock in rats, spinal extensor seizures in DBA/2 mice with a genetic sensitivity to seizures induced by loud noise, and in rats &quot;kindled&quot; to produce focal seizures by repeated prior electrical stimulation of the hippocampus. Gabapentin slightly increased spontaneous absence-like seizures in a genetically susceptible strain recorded with electroencephalography. All of these effects of gabapentin were seen at dosages at or below the threshold for producing ataxia.

Gabapentin also has been tested in a wide variety of animal models that are relevant for analgesic actions. Generally, gabapentin is not active to prevent pain-related behaviors in models of acute nociceptive pain, but it prevents pain-related behaviors when animals are made sensitive by prior peripheral inflammation or peripheral nerve damage (inflammatory or neuropathic conditions). 

===Pharmacodynamics===
Gabapentin is a ligand of the α2δ calcium channel subunit. The α2δ-1 protein is coded by the CACNA2D1 gene. α2δ was first described as an auxiliary protein connected to the main α1 subunit (the channel-forming protein) of high voltage activated voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-type, N-type, P/Q type, and R-type). The same α2δ protein has more recently been shown to interact directly with some NMDA-type and AMPA-type glutamate receptors at presynaptic sites and also with thrombospondin (an extracellular matrix protein secreted by astroglial cells). 

Gabapentin is not a direct calcium channel blocker: it exerts its actions by disrupting the regulatory function of α2δ and its interactions with other proteins. Gabapentin reduces delivery of intracellular calcium channels to the cell membrane, reduces the activation of the channels by the α2δ subunit, decreases signaling leading to neurotransmitters release, and disrupts interactions of α2δ with voltage gated calcium channels but also with NMDA receptors, neurexins, and thrombospondin. These proteins are found as mutually interacting parts of the presynaptic active zone, where numerous protein molecules interact with each other to enable and to regulate the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic vesicles into the synaptic space.

Out of the four known isoforms of α2δ protein, gabapentin binds with similar high affinity to two: α2δ-1 and α2δ-2. All of the pharmacological properties of gabapentin tested to date are explained by its binding to just one isoform – α2δ-1.

The endogenous α-amino acids -leucine and -isoleucine, which resemble gabapentin in chemical structure, bind α2δ with similar affinity to gabapentin and are present in human cerebrospinal fluid at micromolar concentrations. They may be the endogenous ligands of the α2δ subunit, and they competitively antagonize the effects of gabapentin. Accordingly, while gabapentin has nanomolar affinity for the α2δ subunit, its potency &quot;in vivo&quot; is in the low micromolar range, and competition for binding by endogenous -amino acids is likely to be responsible for this discrepancy.

Gabapentin is a potent activator of voltage-gated potassium channels KCNQ3 and KCNQ5, even at low nanomolar concentrations. However, this activation is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism of gabapentin&#x27;s therapeutic effects.

Gabapentin is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter glutamate and competitively inhibits branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT), slowing down the synthesis of glutamate. In particular, it inhibits BCAT-1 at high concentrations (Ki = 1 mM), but not BCAT-2. At very high concentrations gabapentin can suppress the growth of cancer cells, presumably by affecting mitochondrial catabolism, however, the precise mechanism remains elusive.

Even though gabapentin is a structural GABA analogue, and despite its name, it does not bind to the GABA receptors, does not convert into or another GABA receptor agonist &quot;in vivo&quot;, and does not modulate GABA transport or metabolism within the range of clinical dosing. In vitro gabapentin has been found to very weakly inhibit the GABA aminotransferase enzyme (Ki = 17–20 mM), however, this effect is so weak it is not clinically relevant at prescribed doses.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Gabapentin is absorbed from the intestines by an active transport process mediated via an amino acid transporter, presumably, LAT2. As a result, the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin is dose-dependent, with diminished bioavailability and delayed peak levels at higher doses.

The oral bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 80% at 100 mg administered three times daily once every 8 hours, but decreases to 60% at 300 mg, 47% at 400 mg, 34% at 800 mg, 33% at 1,200 mg, and 27% at 1,600 mg, all with the same dosing schedule. Drugs that increase the transit time of gabapentin in the small intestine can increase its oral bioavailability; when gabapentin was co-administered with oral morphine, the oral bioavailability of a 600 mg dose of gabapentin increased by 50%.

Gabapentin at a low dose of 100 mg has a Tmax (time to peak levels) of approximately 1.7 hours, while the Tmax increases to 3 to 4 hours at higher doses. Food does not significantly affect the Tmax of gabapentin and increases the Cmax and area-under-curve levels of gabapentin by approximately 10%.

Gabapentin can cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. Gabapentin concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is approximately 9–14% of its blood plasma concentration. Due to its low lipophilicity, gabapentin requires active transport across the blood–brain barrier. The LAT1 is highly expressed at the blood–brain barrier and transports gabapentin across into the brain. As with intestinal absorption mediated by an amino acid transporter, the transport of gabapentin across the blood–brain barrier by LAT1 is saturable. Gabapentin does not bind to other drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) or OCTN2 (SLC22A5). It is not significantly bound to plasma proteins (&lt;1%).

Gabapentin undergoes little or no metabolism.

Gabapentin is generally safe in people with liver cirrhosis.

Gabapentin is eliminated renally in the urine. It has a relatively short elimination half-life, with the reported average value of 5 to 7 hours. Because of its short elimination half-life, gabapentin must be administered 3 to 4 times per day to maintain therapeutic levels. Gabapentin XR (brand name Gralise) is taken once a day.

==Chemistry==
Gabapentin is a 3,3-disubstituted derivative of GABA. Therefore, it is a GABA analogue, as well as a γ-amino acid. It is similar to several other compounds that collectively are called gabapentinoids. Specifically, it is a derivative of GABA with a pentyl disubstitution at 3 position, hence, the name - gaba&quot;pentin&quot;, in such a way as to form a six-membered ring. After the formation of the ring, the amine and carboxylic groups are not in the same relative positions as they are in the GABA; they are more conformationally constrained.

Although it has been known for some time that gabapentin must bind to the α2δ-1 protein in order to act pharmacologically (see Pharmacodynamics), the three-dimensional structure of the α2δ-1 protein with gabapentin bound (or alternatively, the native amino acid, L-Isoleucine bound) has only recently been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy. A figure of this drug-bound structure is shown in the Chemistry section of the entry on gabapentinoid drugs. This study confirms other findings to show that both compounds alternatively can bind at a single extracellular site (somewhat distant from the calcium conducting pore of the voltage gated calcium channel α1 subunit) on the calcium channel and chemotaxis (Cache1) domain of α2δ-1. 

===Synthesis===
A process for chemical synthesis and isolation of gabapentin with high yield and purity starts with conversion of 1,1-cyclohexanediacetic anhydride to 1,1-cyclohexanediacetic acid monoamide and is followed by a &#x27;Hofmann&#x27; rearrangement in an aqueous solution of sodium hypobromite prepared in situ.

==History==
GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. By the early 1970s, it was appreciated that there are two main classes of GABA receptors, GABAA and GABAB and also that baclofen was an agonist of GABAB receptors. Gabapentin was designed, synthesized and tested in mice by researchers at the pharmaceutical company Goedecke AG in Freiburg, Germany (a subsidiary of Parke-Davis). It was meant to be an analogue of the neurotransmitter GABA that could more easily cross the blood–brain barrier. It was first synthesized in 1974/75 and described in 1975 by Satzinger and Hartenstein. 

The first pharmacology findings published were sedating properties and prevention of seizures in mice evoked by the GABA antagonist, thiosemicarbazide. Shortly after, gabapentin was shown in vitro to reduce the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine from slices of rat caudate nucleus (striatum). This study provided evidence that the action of gabapentin, unlike baclofen, did not arise from the GABAB receptor. Subsequently, more than 2,000 scientific papers have been published that contain the words &quot;gabapentin pharmacology&quot; or &quot;pharmacology of gabapentin&quot; (Google Scholar citation search).

Initial clinical trials utilizing small numbers of subjects were for treatment of spasticity and migraine but neither study had statistical power to allow conclusions. In 1987, the first positive results with gabapentin were obtained in a clinical trial using three dose groups versus pre-treatment seizure frequency for 75 days, as add-on treatment in patients who still had seizures despite taking other medications. This study did not show statistically significant results, but it did show a strong dose-related trend to decreased frequency of seizures.

Under the brand name Neurontin, it was first approved in the United Kingdom in May 1993, for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. Approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration followed in December 1993, also for use as an adjuvant (effective when added to other antiseizure drugs) medication to control partial seizures in adults; that indication was extended to children in 2000. Subsequently, gabapentin was approved in the United States for the treatment of pain from postherpetic neuralgia in 2002. A generic version of gabapentin first became available in the United States in 2004. An extended-release formulation of gabapentin for once-daily administration, under the brand name Gralise, was approved in the United States for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in January 2011.

In recent years, gabapentin has been prescribed for an increasing range of disorders and is one of the more common medications used, particularly in elderly people.

==Society and culture==
===Legal status===

====United Kingdom====
Effective April 2019, the United Kingdom reclassified the drug as a class C controlled substance.

====United States====
Gabapentin is not a controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act. Effective 1 July 2017, Kentucky classified gabapentin as a schedule V controlled substance statewide. Gabapentin is scheduled V drug in other states such as West Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Utah, and Virginia.

===Off-label promotion===
Although some small, non-controlled studies in the 1990s—mostly sponsored by gabapentin&#x27;s manufacturer—suggested that treatment for bipolar disorder with gabapentin may be promising, the preponderance of evidence suggests that it is not effective.

====&quot;Franklin v. Parke-Davis&quot; case====

After the corporate acquisition of the original patent holder, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer admitted that there had been violations of FDA guidelines regarding the promotion of unproven off-label uses for gabapentin in the &quot;Franklin v. Parke-Davis&quot; case.

While off-label prescriptions are common for many drugs, marketing of off-label uses of a drug is not. In 2004, Warner-Lambert (which subsequently was acquired by Pfizer) agreed to plead guilty for activities of its Parke-Davis subsidiary, and to pay $430 million in fines to settle civil and criminal charges regarding the marketing of Neurontin for off-label purposes. The 2004 settlement was one of the largest in U.S. history up to that point, and the first off-label promotion case brought successfully under the False Claims Act.

Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan sued Pfizer Inc., alleging that the pharmaceutical company had misled Kaiser by recommending Neurontin as an off-label treatment for certain conditions (including bipolar disorder, migraines, and neuropathic pain). In 2010, a federal jury in Massachusetts ruled in Kaiser&#x27;s favor, finding that Pfizer violated the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and was liable for in damages, which was automatically trebled to just under $142.1 million. Aetna, Inc. and a group of employer health plans prevailed in their similar Neurontin-related claims against Pfizer. Pfizer appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the verdict, and in 2013, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

====Gabasync====

Gabasync, a treatment consisting of a combination of gabapentin and two other medications (flumazenil and hydroxyzine) as well as therapy, is an ineffective treatment promoted for methamphetamine addiction, though it had also been claimed to be effective for dependence on alcohol or cocaine. It was marketed as PROMETA. While the individual drugs had been approved by the FDA, their off-label use for addiction treatment has not. Gabasync was marketed by Hythiam, Inc. which is owned by Terren Peizer, a former junk bond salesman who has since been convicted of securities fraud relative to another company. Hythiam charges up to $15,000 per patient to license its use (of which half goes to the prescribing physician, and half to Hythiam).

In November 2011, the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (financed by Hythiam and carried out at UCLA) were published in the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Addiction&quot;. It concluded that Gabasync is ineffective: &quot;The PROMETA protocol, consisting of flumazenil, gabapentin and hydroxyzine, appears to be no more effective than placebo in reducing methamphetamine use, retaining patients in treatment or reducing methamphetamine craving.&quot;

&quot;Barrons&quot;, in a November 2005 article entitled &quot;Curb Your Cravings For This Stock&quot;, wrote &quot;If the venture works out for patients and the investing public, it&#x27;ll be a rare success for Peizer, who&#x27;s promoted a series of disappointing small-cap medical or technology stocks ... since his days at Drexel&quot;. Journalist Scott Pelley said to Peizer in 2007: &quot;Depending and who you talk to, you&#x27;re either a revolutionary or a snake oil salesman.&quot; &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;NBC News&quot;, and &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; criticized Peizer after the company bypassed clinical studies and government approval when bringing to market Prometa; the addiction drug proved to be completely ineffective. Journalist Adam Feuerstein opined: &quot;most of what Peizer says is dubious-sounding hype&quot;.

==== Usage trends ====
The period from 2008 to 2018 saw a significant increase in the consumption of gabapentinoids. A study published in Nature Communications in 2023 highlights this trend, demonstrating a notable escalation in sales of gabapentinoids. The study, which analyzed healthcare data across 65 countries/ regions, found that the consumption rate of gabapentinoids had doubled over the decade, driven by their use in a wide range of indications.

===Brand names===
Gabapentin was originally marketed under the brand name Neurontin. Since it became generic, it has been marketed worldwide using over 300 different brand names. An extended-release formulation of gabapentin for once-daily administration was introduced in 2011, for postherpetic neuralgia under the brand name Gralise.

In the US, Neurontin is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer.

===Related drugs===
Parke-Davis developed a drug called pregabalin, which is related in structure to gabapentin, as a successor to gabapentin. Another similar drug atagabalin has been unsuccessfully tried by Pfizer as a treatment for insomnia. A prodrug form (gabapentin enacarbil) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

===Recreational use===

When taken in excess, gabapentin can induce euphoria, a sense of calm, a cannabis-like high, improved sociability, and reduced alcohol or cocaine cravings. Also known on the streets as &quot;Gabbies&quot;, gabapentin was reported in 2017 to be increasingly abused and misused for these euphoric effects. About 1 percent of the responders to an Internet poll and 22 percent of those attending addiction facilities had a history of abuse of gabapentin. Gabapentin misuse, toxicity, and use in suicide attempts among adults in the US increased from 2013 to 2017.

After Kentucky implemented stricter legislation regarding opioid prescriptions in 2012, there was an increase in gabapentin-only and multi-drug use from 2012 to 2015. The majority of these cases were from overdose in suspected suicide attempts. These rates were also accompanied by increases in abuse and recreational use.

Withdrawal symptoms, often resembling those of benzodiazepine withdrawal, play a role in the physical dependence some users experience. Its misuse predominantly coincides with the usage of other CNS depressant drugs, namely opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol.

==Veterinary use==
In cats, gabapentin can be used as an analgesic in multi-modal pain management, anxiety medication to reduce stress during travel or vet visits, and anticonvulsant. 

Veterinarians may prescribe gabapentin as an anticonvulsant and pain reliever in dogs. It has beneficial effects for treating epilepsy, different kinds of pain (chronic, neuropathic, and post-operative pain), and anxiety, lip-licking behaviour, storm phobia, fear-based aggression.

It is also used to treat chronic pain-associated nerve inflammation in horses and dogs. Side effects include tiredness and loss of coordination, but these effects generally go away within 24 hours of starting the medication.

<text>The United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) is an association of Alberta farmers that has served different roles in its 100-year history – as a lobby group, a successful political party, and as a farm-supply retail chain. As a political party, it formed the government of Alberta from 1921 to 1935.

Since 1935, it has primarily been an agricultural supply cooperative headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. , UFA operates 34 farm and ranch supply stores in Alberta and over 110 fuel stations in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan.

== Founding as lobby group ==
UFA was founded in 1909 as a government lobby group following a merger between the Alberta Farmers&#x27; Association and Alberta branches of the Canadian Society for Equity. The UFA began as a non-partisan organization whose aim was to be a lobby group promoting the interest of farmers in the province. In 1913, under president William John Tregillus, the UFA successfully pressured Alberta&#x27;s Liberal government to organize the Alberta Farmers&#x27; Cooperative Elevator Company (AFCEC), which joined with other Prairie elevator companies to eventually become the United Grain Growers.
Tregillus was the first president of the AFCEC.

The UFA was a believer in the co-operative movement and supported women&#x27;s suffrage. In 1912 women founded the parallel United Farm Women of Alberta, and in 1914, women were granted full membership rights in UFA itself.

By 1920, UFA had become the most influential lobby group in Alberta with over 30,000 registered members.

==Political history==
===Entry into politics===
Under pressure of losing influence to the upstart Alberta Non-Partisan League – which ran in four rural constituencies in the 1917 provincial election, winning two – and dissatisfied with the existing political parties, UFA entered the political arena in 1919. Some prominent UFA members (including its president, Henry Wise Wood) at first opposed entering into direct politics, as opposed to lobbying, however, because they thought abandoning the UFA&#x27;s non-partisan policy would cause the UFA to break up.

In 1919, the UFA won a by-election in the Cochrane constituency. In 1921, Robert Gardiner won a seat in a federal by-election, becoming UFA&#x27;s first Member of Parliament. 
Encouraged by this, UFA ran in 45 of Alberta&#x27;s 61 ridings in the 1921 provincial election. To the surprise of nearly everyone, including themselves, UFA took 38 seats in the election, winning a majority government, and sweeping the Liberals out of power after almost 16 years. UFA and Progressive party candidates also captured all but two of the Alberta federal seats in the 1921 federal election (the other two were taken by Labour candidates).

===Majority governments===
As was the case with other United Farmer governments in Manitoba and Ontario, the UFA was elected unexpectedly and without a leader. To form its cabinet it went outside the Legislature to recruit a Premier, as did the other United Farmer governments. The UFA even approached Liberal leader Charles Stewart to remain as premier. Stewart declined, however, not wanting to lead the assembly as a member of the opposition. UFA President Henry Wise Wood also declined, and Vice-President Percival Baker, an elected MLA, died 24 hours after the election. Ultimately, UFA executive member Herbert Greenfield was named the first UFA Premier. Among his cabinet were Irene Parlby, the second female cabinet minister in the British Empire, and Calgary Labour Party MLA Alex Ross as Minister of Public Works.

The United Farmers government initiated several reforms, including improving medical care, broadening labour rights and making the tax system fairer. It made good on its promise of electoral reform, bringing in a measure of proportional representation through the STV. In 1923, the government formed the Alberta Wheat Pool and upset some of its support base by ending Prohibition, replacing it with open sale of alcohol through government-owned liquor stores and carefully regulated beer parlours, and refusing to establish a provincial bank, a bank owned by the provincial government, despite UFA conventions calling for it.

In 1925, John E. Brownlee, who was already widely believed to be the &quot;true&quot; leader of the United Farmers, succeeded Greenfield as Premier. Brownlee led the party to a second majority government in the 1926 election.

In 1929, after years of negotiating, Brownlee gained control over Alberta&#x27;s natural resources. This was a right other provinces were granted at Confederation or upon entry into Confederation, but which Alberta and Saskatchewan were denied when they became provinces in 1905, instead receiving a yearly cash subsidy from the federal government. This deal would later become a critical factor in Alberta&#x27;s economic success as the province&#x27;s oil deposits were exploited.

Riding a wave of popularity resulting from this agreement, Brownlee led the United Farmers to a third majority government in the 1930 election, despite alienating socialists and labour groups as he led the party in a conservative fashion, and despite the quickly deteriorating financial conditions.

===Decline===
The Great Depression had a critical impact on the United Farmers&#x27; fortunes, as the crash in grain prices and simultaneous drought in southern Alberta hurt its support base, farmers. The government, with reduced tax revenue, engaged in cuts in services, staff and wages. The province was in debt after the grandiose spending of the relatively prosperous 1920s. The government also bailed out the hard-pressed Alberta Wheat Pool in 1929. Banks were repossessing the farms of many farmers who were unable to pay off their loans and interest when grain prices were lower than the cost of production. The government&#x27;s Liberal and Conservative opponents grew louder and they hoped to become popular. At the same time, however, the government faced opposition from socialists calling for more interventionist anti-capitalist policies and for radical monetary reform. The latter stance was supported by William Aberhart&#x27;s Social Credit movement, which in 1933–35 grew to a potent force among the province&#x27;s farmers.

Henry Wise Wood retired as president of the UFA, more-radical-minded UFA MP Robert Gardiner, a member of the Ginger Group became president; the UFA conventions passed increased calls for strong government measures to address the province&#x27;s widespread poverty; the UFA joined with the Canadian Labour Party and other political groups to help found the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, the first Canada-wide farmer/labour political party (other than the revolutionary Communist Party of Canada). Premier Brownlee on more than one occasion opposed the UFA&#x27;s leftward slide. The final blow for Brownlee occurred when he was caught up in a sex scandal as he was accused of seducing a young clerk working in the Attorney General&#x27;s office. Brownlee resigned in disgrace in July 1934.

Richard G. Reid succeeded Brownlee as Premier, however with many voters jumping to the new Social Credit Party, the United Farmers&#x27; fall in politics was as rapid as its rise. The party was wiped off the political map in the 1935 election, losing all of its seats and tallying only 11 percent of the vote.

Of the nine UFA MPs elected in the 1930 federal election, eight joined the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation after it was formed in 1932. All eight ran as CCF candidates in the 1935 federal election and were defeated by a Social Credit landslide. The ninth UFA MP, William Thomas Lucas of Camrose, ran as a Conservative and was also defeated by the Socreds.

Two years after the UFA government was defeated, the organization withdrew from electoral politics. In 1938, the CCF committed itself to run candidates in the next provincial and elections, setting up local riding clubs for that purpose. In 1939, UFA officially disbanded its political arm, still continuing as a farmers supply co-operative. Many of the left-wing members of the UFA organization joined the CCF, though that party would not win the support of most former UFA voters. Many right-wing and centrist members of the UFA joined the Alberta Unity Movement, an attempt to form a coalition between United Farmers, Liberals and Conservatives to defeat Social Credit in the 1940 provincial election.

The CCF was folded into the New Democratic Party in 1961. Its Alberta wing claims the Alberta CCF&#x27;s history as its own, thus making it a linear descendant of the UFA.

==Federal politics==
The United Farmers of Alberta ran candidates in several federal elections in alignment with, but usually to the left of, the Progressive Party of Canada with a number of UFA MPs sitting in the House of Commons with the Ginger Group of left wing MPs.

Following Robert Gardiner&#x27;s election in a federal by-election prior to the 1921 election, Alberta farmer ran 14 candidates (some as UFA, some as Progressive Party candidates) in the 1921 federal election, not running in two Calgary ridings where strong Labour candidates carried the farmer-worker banner. All the UFA candidates (and the two Calgary Labour candidates) were elected, the incumbent Liberal MPs and Conservative contenders not getting one seat. In 1926, the province&#x27;s Progressive MPs ran for re-election as UFA candidates. Eight of the UFA&#x27;s 9 remaining MPs joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation when it was formed in 1932. All eight ran as CCF candidates in the 1935 federal election and were defeated. The ninth, William Thomas Lucas, ran as a Conservative in 1935 and was also defeated by the Social Credit landslide that were elections in Alberta that year.

==The modern cooperative==
Following the dissolution of its political wing, UFA focused on its commercial operations. UFA entered into a partnership with Maple Leaf Fuels, a subsidiary of Imperial Oil in 1935 to distribute fuel to its members. The next year it began to open retail stations under the Maple Leaf brand across the province.

The first farm supply store opened in Calgary in 1954, and a second in Edmonton in 1957. That same year, UFA bought the assets of Maple Leaf Fuels, giving the co-op greater control over the business.

In 1984, UFA opened its first cardlock fuel agency in Calgary. Today, UFA has over 110 cardlock facilities across three provinces and was the largest cardlock network in Alberta.

UFA has over 120,000 members; further, with 2007 revenues of over $1.8 billion, UFA is ranked as the 37th largest business in Alberta by revenue according to Alberta Venture magazine.

In March 2009, UFA purchased Wholesale Sports in western Canada, and 15 Sportsman&#x27;s Warehouse locations throughout the Northwest United States, which it then re-branded as Wholesale Sports.

<text>The Blériot SPAD S.510 was a French single-seat, single-engined biplane fighter aircraft. First flying in 1933, 60 were built for the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; (French Air Force), entering service in 1936. The type remained in service as a fighter-trainer at the start of the Second World War. It was the last French biplane fighter to enter production.

==Development==
The Blériot-SPAD S.510 was designed by André Herbemont to meet a 1930 French requirement for a single seat fighter. The new fighter was required to have a speed of at an altitude of (later increased to at the same height), with an armament of either four machine guns, one 20 mm cannon and two machine guns, or two cannon. Herbemont&#x27;s design was based on his earlier S.91, and of the 11 designs submitted to meet the requirement, was the only biplane. 

The SPAD 510 was of all-metal construction, with fabric-covered wings and tail, and a monocoque rear fuselage. The aircraft had a fixed conventional landing gear, which had a reputation for being fragile in service, with faired mainwheels and a tailskid. The aircraft was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Xbrs liquid-cooled V12 engine rated at driving a two-bladed wooden propeller. Armament consisted of four 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns mounted under the lower wing (the prototype carried the same armament, but with two guns in the fuselage). The last two production SPAD 510s were fitted with a Hispano-Suiza 12Xcrs engine, allowing a Hispano-Suiza 20 mm cannon to be mounted between the engine&#x27;s cylinder banks, and firing through the propeller.

The sole prototype first flew on 6 January 1933. Flight testing revealed handling problems which resulted in the aircraft&#x27;s centre fuselage being lengthened by and its vertical tail surfaces being enlarged. During evaluation in 1935 against the already in production Dewoitine D.500 at the Centre d&#x27;expériences aériennes militaires (CEAM), the French military aviation research centre at Reims, the SPAD 510 demonstrated superior manoeuvrability and climb rate. As a result, an order for 60 aircraft was placed on 30 August 1935. 
Performance was similar to the British Gloster Gladiator. The S.510&#x27;s armament generally consisted of 4 machine guns (installed as either a combination of 2 fuselage-mounted guns, plus 2 in under-wing gondolas or with all 4 in under-wing gondolas). This gave it a much heavier attack capability than most earlier biplane fighters and equalled that of the final biplanes used by the British and Italians, the Gladiator and Fiat CR.42 Falco. The S.510 was doomed to obsolescence before it even flew, although when it was designed many pilots and experts strongly believed that biplanes would prove better fighters than monoplanes because of their tighter turning circles. Despite its strengths, the S.510 only enjoyed about a year of usefulness. An adequate fighter for 1936, it was quickly outclassed by the new more modern monoplanes developed by Germany, Britain, and France. It had fixed landing gear as well as a weak fuel system and undercarriage.

In response to a 1934 French competition for a more modern single-seat fighter, Herbemont designed the Blériot-SPAD S.710, based on the 510. The SPAD 710, while still a biplane, had a retractable undercarriage and an enclosed cockpit and was fitted with a V-tail. It was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine, which was estimated to give a speed of . A prototype flew for the first time in April 1937, but crashed on 15 June that year due to tail flutter, killing the pilot. This caused further development to be abandoned.

==Operational history==
Deliveries of the SPAD 510 to the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; (i.e. the French Air Force) began in early 1936, with the new fighters replacing the Morane-Saulnier M.S.225s of &quot;Groupe de Chasse&quot; 1/7 (GC 1/7) from May 1937, and the Nieuport-Delage NiD 62s and NiD 629s of &quot;Groupe de Chasse II/7&quot; (GC II/7) from July 1937. In 1937, SPAD 510s were used to equip the Weiser circus aerobatic team, named after the commander of &quot;7e Escadre&quot; (7th Wing, the parent unit of the two &quot;Groupe&quot;s), which displayed around France that year. In 1938, with increasing tensions between France and Germany, the two &quot;Groupe&quot;″s SPADs were fitted with radios, allowing them to be declared as fit for combat, with some aircraft being fitted with revised exhausts to aid night flying. From January 1939, GC I/7 began to re-equip with modern Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighter monoplanes, with the last SPAD 510 discarded in February, while GC II/7 replaced its SPAD 510s by M.S.406s later that year, completing its re-equipment just before its mobilisation at the start of the Second World War.

In August 1939, obsolete fighters held in storage in France after being replaced in the front line units were used to equip &quot;Escadrilles Régionales de Chasse&quot; (ERC - regional fighter flights) to train reservists, with two flights formed in mainland France with a mixture of SPAD 510s and older NiD-622s, ERC 3/561 at Saint-Inglevert Airfield and ERC 4/561 at Villacoublay. In October, the two ERCs joined together to form &quot;Groupe Aėrien Régional de Chasse&quot; II/561 (GARC II/561) based at Havre-Oteville. On 18 January 1940 GARC II/561 was redesignated as GC III/10, which received Bloch MB.151s over the next few weeks to allow the unit to transition to a front-line fighter role. The displaced S.510s returned to their training role where they served until the Armistice of 22 June 1940. Approximately ten S.510s were sent to French North Africa in 1939 to join ERCs at Oran and Rabat. In May 1940, the ERCs based in French North Africa were combined to form a new fighter group, GC III/5, with equipment including SPAD 510s, but these were replaced by Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s by the end of May.

Reports that it may have served in the Spanish Republican Air Force during the Spanish Civil War are doubtful. There is no evidence that S.510 were ever actually sent and they may have been confused with the Blériot-SPAD S.91 or with the Dewoitine D.510 that were delivered to the &quot;Escuadrilla Internacional&quot;.

<text>Flotta () is a small island in Orkney, Scotland, lying in Scapa Flow. The island is known for its large oil terminal and is linked by Orkney Ferries to Houton on the Orkney Mainland, Lyness on Hoy and Longhope on South Walls. The island has a population of 80.

==History==
At the turn of the 20th century, the island was a quiet rural community like many other small islands of Orkney, but its sheltered location led to three major upheavals in the island in the century.

Until 1914, Flotta was a quiet farming community. In 1910, a population of 431 included two blacksmiths, four carpenters and three dressmakers.

===World Wars===
Everything changed with the arrival of the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow at the start of the First World War. There is a photograph held by the Imperial War Museum in London that shows a boxing match taking place on Flotta in front of a wartime audience of 10,000 people.

During the First World War, the island was home to a naval base. The dreadnought HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; sank nearby in 1917, reputedly the worst maritime disaster in UK waters. In the Second World War, the island was again used as a military base.

1918 saw the mass exodus of Navy personnel, and 1939 saw their return. After the Second World War the island had good piers and facilities, but a slowly declining population. It took until 1970 for fresh water to be piped to the island from Hoy.

===North Sea oil===

In 1974, Occidental Petroleum started construction of the island&#x27;s oil terminal. This became the second largest major oil terminal serving the UK North Sea, the largest being Sullom Voe in Shetland.

It took only two years from the start of construction until the first of the crude oil was pumped into the terminal, during which thousands of workers were posted at the &quot;camp&quot; in Flotta to complete the facility as Britain&#x27;s thirst for oil was growing by the day. The Flotta oil terminal was opened by the energy minister, Tony Benn MP, on 11 January 1977.

The oil terminal provides the landing for the Piper and Claymore fields pipeline system. In addition, it provides a safe facility for the receipt and transshipment of oil produced from the UK Atlantic margins.

==Geography and environment==
Flotta lies at the southern end of Scapa Flow, with Calf of Flotta being at the north-east corner of the island. The island of Fara is across Weddel Sound, to the north-west. Meanwhile, Switha, South Walls and Hoy are each approximately from Flotta, to the south, south-west and west, respectively. Nevi Skerry is situated east of Flotta in the Sound of Hoxa. South Ronaldsay is approximately east of Flotta, also across the sound of Hoxa. The highest point on Flotta is West Hill at , adjacent to the wind turbine. The main population centre is at Whome, which is situated in the centre of the southern half of the island. To the north, Whome is separated from the Golta Peninsula by Pan Hope, a tidal bay.

===Flora and fauna===
Flotta has a seal colony at Stanger Head, at the south-east corner of the island. The Royal Navy planted 1000 spruce trees during the Second World War, which are situated between Sutherland Pier and the oil terminal, in the vicinity of the Naval Cinema. About 10% of the spruce trees survive. The oil company has also planted 40,000 trees and shrubs. Much of the western side of the island is heath, as is the Golta Peninsula to the north-east of the island.

==Community==

The island has a usually resident population of 80 people in 48 households. The main centre of population is in the settlement of Whome. The community primary school is mothballed due to there being no children of that age left on the island.

Healthcare services are provided by the Stromness Surgery, with a nurse practitioner based on Flotta. Flotta Fire Station, which is situated next to the school, formally closed on 25 October 2012. The service provided by the fire station was transferred to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service on 1 April 2013.

The 2.3MW wind turbine, which was installed in 2010, will provide the community with a cash contribution of £100,000 over the lifetime of the turbine.

==Economy==
The main industry on the island is energy production and distribution. Repsol Sinopec Energy UK Limited&#x27;s Flotta oil terminal, processes oil from the North Sea for onward transfer. The oil terminal has been operational for 36 years. Opus Plus Ltd., an environmental research company, is also based within the oil terminal complex. Supplied by German manufacturer Enercon, the 2.3MW Flotta wind turbine was brought online in June 2010 at a cost of £3 million. The turbine, which is connected to the National Grid, has a hub height of and a rotor diameter of .

The Orkney Island Council provides employment to several people on Flotta. Farming remains an important source of revenue for the island economy, along with handicraft. A small number of residents are also employed on the Orkney Mainland.

The island is served by one shop, which operates as a general store, a post office and a petrol station. The nearest supermarkets are situated in Kirkwall, on the Orkney Mainland, which has branches of Tesco and Lidl.

The island has a mains water supply, and boreholes are also used. Flotta didn&#x27;t have a mains electricity supply until 1977, although most households had had their own electricity generators for many years beforehand. Mains electricity is supplied by Scottish Hydro Electric. The island is connected to the BT telephone network. Mobile phone connections can be an issue. Broadband internet connection is possible on the island. There is no mains gas supply on Flotta, although coal and heating oil are delivered regularly, and Calor Gas is stored at the shop.

In 2005, Flotta was considered to have the potential of expanding the island economy with heritage tourism, and with a particular regard for the Second World War-era structures which are spread across the island. The possible development of a marina was also considered, at that time.

==Transport==

===Marine===

The island is served by Orkney Ferries with ferry links to Houton on the Orkney Mainland, Lyness on Hoy, and Longhope on South Walls. The ferries berth at Gibraltar Pier, also known as Heyspan Pier, which is to the north-west of the island in Weddel Sound. Orkney Ferries&#x27; &quot;South Isles&quot; service is usually provided by MV &quot;Hoy Head&quot;, whilst MV &quot;Thorsvoe&quot; serves as a relief vessel. Flotta is situated a few miles from St Margaret&#x27;s Hope on South Ronaldsay, which has a direct ferry service to mainland Scotland. However, there is no direct public ferry service between Flotta and South Ronaldsay, across the Sound of Hoxa. For a transport connection to the Scottish mainland, one must instead travel by ferry to Houton, and then by road to either Stromness or to St. Margaret&#x27;s Hope, via a much more circuitous route.

A couple of hundred metres to the south-west of Gibraltar Pier is Sutherland Pier, also in Weddel Sound. Sutherland Pier is used by local vessels of similar size to the ferries. A third public pier, Pan Pier, is situated at the southern side of Pan Hope, the island&#x27;s central bay. Pan Pier is used by smaller private boats. The oil terminal has its own jetty on the northern side of the island, which has the capability to accommodate oil tankers.

===Airport===
Flotta Isle Airport is located on the south side of the island. It opened in 1976 as an inter-island airport, and changed hands to Elf Exploration UK in 2001. Today, the airport is used only for emergency landings, and air ambulances.

===Road===
The main roads on Flotta are the B9045 and the B9046, which connect the ferry terminal with the settlement of Whome. Flotta has no causeways similar to the Churchill Barriers, which could allow vehicles to be driven to the nearby islands. All road vehicles are reliant on using the ferry to the Orkney Mainland, and to Hoy.

<text>In heraldry, murrey is a &quot;stain&quot;, i. e. a non-standard tincture, that is a dark reddish purple colour. It is most proximate in appearance to the heraldic tincture of purpure, but is distinct therefrom.

==Overview==
According to dictionaries, &quot;murrey&quot; is the colour of mulberries, being somewhere between the heraldic tinctures of gules (red) and purpure (purple), and almost maroon; but examples registered in Canada and Scotland display it as a reddish brown.

==Poetic meanings==
Centuries ago, arms were often described poetically and the tinctures were associated with different gemstones, flowers and heavenly bodies. Murrey usually corresponded to the following:
* Of jewels, the sardonyx

<text>Volhynian Voivodeship (, , , &quot;Volynske voievodstvo&quot;) was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from 1566 until 1569 and of the Polish Crown within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 1569 Union of Lublin until the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. It was part of the Ruthenian lands in the Lesser Poland Province.

==Description==
The voivodeship was established based on the Łuck Eldership (starostvo) in 1566 with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Following the 1569 union of Lublin, it was ceded to the Crown of Poland as part of the Lesser Poland (Malopolska) Province.

The capital of the voivodeship was in Łuck (presentday Lutsk), and it had three senators in the Senate of the Commonwealth. These were the Bishop of Luck, the Voivode of Volhynia and the Castellan of Volhynia. Volhynian Voivodeship was divided into three counties: Luck, Wlodzimierz and Krzemieniec. Local starostas resided in the three capitals of the counties, while sejmiks took place at Luck. The voivodeship had two deputies in the Polish Sejm, and one deputy in the Lesser Poland Tribunal in Lublin.

Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book &quot;Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland&quot; provides this description of Volhynian Voivodeship:

<doc id="482573" wikidata="Q322787" url="?curid=482573" title="Mashed potato">
<text>Mashed potato or mashed potatoes (American, Canadian, and Australian English), colloquially known as mash (British English), is a dish made by mashing boiled or steamed potatoes, usually with added milk, butter, salt, and pepper. It is generally served as a side dish to meat or vegetables. Roughly mashed potatoes are sometimes called smashed potatoes. Dehydrated instant mashed potatoes and frozen mashed potatoes are available. Mashed potatoes are an ingredient in other dishes, such as dumplings and gnocchi.

==History==
The Andean people of South America domesticated as many as 70 different species of potatoes which were commonly prepared by boiling and mashing prior to the European arrival.

An early recipe is found in Hannah Glasse&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Cookery&quot;, published in 1747. Her recipe mashed them in a saucepan with milk, salt, and butter.

==Ingredients==
Most authors recommend the use of &quot;floury&quot; potatoes with a high ratio of amylose in their starch to achieve a fluffy, creamy consistency and appearance. The best-known floury varieties are King Edward, Golden Wonder, and Red Rascal in Britain and the Russet in North America. However, some recipes use &quot;waxy&quot; potatoes containing more amylopectin in their starch for a different texture or look; for instance, one pounded mashed potato dish from Yunnan cuisine (in southwestern China), uses waxy potatoes to achieve a chewy, sticky texture.

Butter, milk or cream, salt, and pepper are usually added. Many other seasonings may also be used, including herbs (notably parsley and chives), spices (notably nutmeg), garlic, cheese, bacon, sour cream, crisp onion or spring onion, caramelized onion, and mustard.

One French variation adds egg yolk for &quot;pommes duchesse&quot;, or Duchess potatoes, piped through a carrot tube into wavy ribbons and rosettes, brushed with butter, and lightly browned. Some French recipes for &quot;pomme purée&quot; (potato puree) use up to one part butter for every two parts potato. In low-calorie or non-dairy variations, milk, cream, and butter may be replaced by soup stock or broth.

&quot;Aloo bharta&quot;, an Indian sub-continent variation, uses chopped onions, mustard (oil, paste, or seeds), chili pepper, coriander leaves, and other spices. &quot;Alu pitika&quot; () is a popular variation of &quot;aloo bharta&quot; in Assam, that may occasionally omit mustard and other spices. &quot;Alu pitika&quot;, made with roasted and smoked potatoes, is especially consumed in the winter.

==Culinary uses==
Mashed potato can be served as a side dish. In the British Isles, sausages served with mashed potatoes are known as bangers and mash. Mashed potato can be an ingredient of various other dishes, including shepherd&#x27;s and cottage pie, Orkney clapshot, pierogi, colcannon, dumplings, potato pancakes, potato croquettes, and gnocchi. Particularly runny mashed potatoes are called &quot;mousseline&quot; potatoes.

In the United Kingdom, cold mashed potato can be mixed with fresh eggs and then fried until crisp to produce a potato cake. This dish is thought to have originated in Cornwall and is a popular breakfast item. When instead combined with meat and other leftover vegetables, the fried dish is known as bubble and squeak.

Mashed potatoes may be eaten with gravy, typically meat gravy, though vegetable gravy is becoming more common as vegetarian and vegan diets increase in popularity.

A potato masher can be used to mash the potatoes. A potato ricer produces a uniform, lump-free, mash.

In India, mashed potatoes made with spices, fried or not, are called chaukha. Chaukha is used in samosas in India and with litti, especially in Bihar.

In Kenya, mashed potatoes are eaten in the form of a dish called irio, native to the Kikuyu tribe. The dish mainly incorporates corn and peas along with other ingredients into the potatoes. It is often accompanied with &quot;nyama choma&quot;, known as grilled meat, which could be either goat or beef.

In Turkey, mashed potatoes made with milk, salt, black pepper, and butter are called &quot;patates puresi&quot;.

<doc id="482575" wikidata="Q333323" url="?curid=482575" title="Pietro da Cortona">
<text>Pietro da Cortona (; 1 November 1596 or 159716 May 1669) was an Italian Baroque painter and architect. Along with his contemporaries and rivals Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Francesco Borromini, he was one of the key figures in the emergence of Roman Baroque architecture. He was also an important designer of interior decorations.

He was born Pietro Berrettini, but is primarily known by the name of his native town of Cortona in Tuscany. He worked mainly in Rome and Florence. He is best known for his frescoed ceilings such as the vault of the &quot;salone&quot; or main salon of the Palazzo Barberini in Rome and carried out extensive painting and decorative schemes for the Medici family in Florence and for the Oratorian fathers at the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella in Rome. He also painted numerous canvases. Only a limited number of his architectural projects were built but nonetheless they are as distinctive and as inventive as those of his rivals.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Berrettini was born into a family of artisans and masons, in Cortona, then a town in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. He trained in painting in Florence under Andrea Commodi, but soon he departed for Rome at around 1612/3, where he joined the studio of Baccio Ciarpi. He was involved in fresco decorations at the Palazzo Mattei in 1622-3 under the direction of Agostino Ciampelli and Cardinal Orsini had commissioned from him an &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; (c. 1626) for San Salvatore in Lauro.
In Rome, he had encouragement from many prominent patrons. According to Cortona&#x27;s biographers his gifted copy of Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Galatea&quot; fresco brought him to the attention of , papal treasurer during the papacy of Pope Urban VIII. Such contacts helped him gain an early major commission in Rome (1624–1626), a fresco decoration in the church of Santa Bibiana that was being renovated under the direction of Bernini. In 1626, the Sacchetti family engaged Cortona to paint three large canvases of &quot;The Sacrifice of Polyxena&quot;, &quot;The Triumph of Bacchus&quot;, and &quot;The Rape of the Sabines&quot; (the latter, c. 1629), and to paint a series of frescoes in the Villa Sacchetti at Castelfusano, near Ostia, using a team that included the young Andrea Sacchi. In the Sacchetti orbit, he met Pope Urban VIII and Cardinal Francesco Barberini, the papal nephew, and their patronage of Cortona provided him with ample scope to demonstrate his abilities as a painter of frescoes and canvases.

===Grand Salon of Palazzo Barberini===
Fresco cycles were numerous in Cortona&#x27;s Rome; many represented &quot;quadri riportati&quot; or painted framed episodes imitating canvases as found in the Sistine Chapel ceiling or in Annibale Carracci&#x27;s &quot;The Loves of the Gods&quot; in the Palazzo Farnese gallery (completed 1601). In 1633, Pope Urban VIII (Maffeo Barberini) commissioned from Cortona a large fresco painting for the main salon ceiling of the Barberini family palace; the Palazzo Barberini. It was completed six years later, following Cortona&#x27;s influential visit to northern Italy where he would have seen at first hand perspectival works by Paolo Veronese and the colour palette of Titian.

Cortona&#x27;s huge &quot;Allegory of Divine Providence and Barberini Power&quot; marks a watershed in Baroque painting. Following the architecture of the room, he created the painted illusion of an open airy architectural framework against which figures are situated, usually seen &#x27;al di sotto in su&#x27; apparently coming into the room itself or floating far above it. The ornamented architectural framework essentially forms five compartments. The central and most significant part celebrates the glorification of the reign of Urban VIII in a light filled scene populated with allegorical figures and Barberini family emblems.

The illusion of spatial extension through paint, the grandiose theme and the skill of execution could only astonish and impress the visitor. However, Cortona&#x27;s panegyric trompe-l&#x27;œil extravaganzas may be less popular in a world familiar with minimalism and such like, yet they are precursors of the sunny figures and cherubim infested with rococo excesses. They contrast markedly with the darker naturalism prominent in Caravaggisti works and with the classicising compositions by painters such as Domenichino and Andrea Sacchi, and remind us that Baroque painting could be grand in an epic manner and exuberant in spirit.

=== Frescoes in Palazzo Pitti ===

Cortona had been patronized by the Tuscan community in Rome, hence it was not surprising when he was passing through Florence in 1637, that he should be asked by Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany to paint a series of frescoes intended to represent Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Four Ages of Man&quot; in the small Sala della Stufa, a room in the Palazzo Pitti. The first two frescoes represented the &quot;ages&quot; of gold and silver. In 1641, he was recalled to paint the &#x27;Bronze Age&#x27; and &#x27;Iron Age&#x27; frescoes. It is said he was guided in the formulation of the allegorical designs by Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger.

He thus began work on the decoration of the grand-ducal reception rooms on the first floor of the Palazzo Pitti, now part of the Palatine Gallery. In these five Planetary Rooms, the hierarchical sequence of the deities is based on Ptolomeic cosmology; Venus, Apollo, Mars, Jupiter (the Medici Throne room) and Saturn, but minus Mercury and the Moon which should have come before Venus. The program for the Planetary Rooms was prepared by Francesco Rondinelli, a member of the circle of Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger. These highly ornate ceilings with frescoes and elaborate stucco work essentially celebrate the Medici lineage and the bestowal of virtuous leadership. Pietro left Florence in 1647 to return to Rome, and his pupil and collaborator, Ciro Ferri, was left to complete the cycle by the 1660s.

===Late works===

For a number of years, Cortona was involved for decades in the decoration of the ceiling frescoes in the Oratorian Chiesa Nuova (Santa Maria in Vallicella) in Rome, a work not finished until 1665. Other frescoes are in Palazzo Pamphilj in Piazza Navona (1651–4).

In 1660, he executed &quot;The Stoning of Saint Stephen&quot; for the church of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio della Massima in Rome. The work currently hangs in the Hermitage Museum.

Towards the end of his life he devoted much of his time to architecture, but he published a treatise on painting in 1652 under a pseudonym and in collaboration. He refused invitations to both France and Spain.

===Debate with Andrea Sacchi===
He was elected as director of the Academy of St Luke the painter&#x27;s guild in Rome, in 1634. It was at the Academy in 1636 that Cortona and Andrea Sacchi were involved in theoretical controversies regarding the number of figures that were appropriate in a painted work.

Sacchi argued for few figures, since he felt it was not possible to grant meaningful individuality, a distinct role, to more than a few figures per scene. Cortona, on the other hand, lobbied for an art that could accommodate many subplots to a central concept. He also likely viewed the possibility of using many human figures in decorative detail or to represent a general concept. Within the context of this debate, the French painter Nicolas Poussin is known to have laughed at this discussion around fixed numbers. Others have seen in this dichotomy, the long-standing debate whether visual art is about theoretical principles and meant to narrate a full story, or a painterly decorative endeavor, meant to delight the senses. Cortona was a director of the Accademia from 1634 to 1638.

Cortona also contributed to a treatise in Florence along with the theologian and Jesuit Giandomenico Ottonelli titled: &quot;Trattato della pittura e scultura, uso et abuso loro: composto da un theologo ed da un pittore&quot; (Stamperia, Giovanni Antonio Bonardi, Florence, 1652). Authorship in subsequent editions is attributed to Cortona.

===Pupils===
Cortona employed or trained many prominent artists, who then disseminated his grand manner style. Apart from Ciro Ferri, others that worked in his studio included:
Romanelli and Camassei also trained under Domenichino. Giovanni Maria Bottala was one of his assistants on the Barberini Ceiling. Sources for (W); while sources for (H). Source for MB is &quot;Dictionary of Painters and Engravers, Biographical and Critical&quot; (Volume II L-Z).

===Architectural projects===

Among Cortona&#x27;s more important architectural projects are the church of Santi Luca e Martina (completed in 1664), and the church of the Accademia di San Luca, located in the Roman Forum. While Cortona was &quot;principe&quot; or director of the Accademia from 1634–38, he obtained permission to dig in the crypt of the church, which led the likely mistaken finding of remains attributed to the first century Roman martyr and Saint Martina. This discovery led to further patronage for construction of the church. The layout is almost a Greek cross, with four nearly identical wings extending from the striking central dome. Much of the ground structure is undecorated, above intricately decorated. The overwhelmingly vertical decoration of the façade is granted liveliness by horizontal convexity. In his will, this bachelor called this church his &quot;beloved daughter&quot;.

He also renovated the exterior renewal of the ancient Santa Maria della Pace (1656–1667), and the façade (with an unusual loggia) of Santa Maria in Via Lata (appr. 1660).

Another influential work for its day was the design and decoration of the Villa Pigneto commissioned by the Marchese Sacchetti. This garden palace or casino gathered a variety of features in a novel fashion, including a garden facade with convex arms, and highly decorated niches, and elaborate tiered staircases surrounding a fountain.

===Anatomical plates===
Prior to becoming famous as an architect, Pietro drew anatomical plates that would not be engraved and published until a hundred years after his death. The plates in &quot;Tabulae anatomicae&quot; are now thought to have been started around 1618. The dramatic and highly studied poses effected by the figures are in keeping with the style of other Renaissance Baroque anatomical artists, although nowhere does such an approach find any fuller expression than in these plates.
