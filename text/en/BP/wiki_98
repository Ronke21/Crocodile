<text>Bernabé Williams Figueroa Jr. (born September 13, 1968) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball player and current musician. He played his entire 16-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Yankees from 1991 through 2006.

A center fielder, Williams was a member of four World Series championship teams with the Yankees. He ended his career with a .297 batting average, 287 home runs, 1,257 runs batted in (RBI), 1,366 runs scored, 449 doubles, and a .990 fielding percentage. He was a five-time All-Star and won four Gold Glove Awards, a Silver Slugger Award, the American League (AL) batting title in 1998, and the 1996 AL Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award. Known for his consistency and postseason heroics, Williams is one of the most beloved Yankees. The team honored him by retiring his uniform number 51 and dedicating a plaque to him in Monument Park in May 2015. Williams is widely regarded as one of the greatest switch-hitting center fielders in history.

Williams is also a classically trained guitarist. Following his retirement from baseball, he has released two jazz albums. He was nominated for a Latin Grammy in 2009.

==Early life==
Bernabé Williams Figueroa Jr. was born on September 13, 1968, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Bernabé Williams Sr., a merchant marine and dispatcher, and Rufina Figueroa, a retired principal and college professor. The Williams family lived in the Bronx until Bernie was one year old, when they moved to Puerto Rico.

Growing up, Williams played classical guitar as well as baseball. He was also active in track and field, winning medals at an international meet at the age of 15. At the 1984 Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships in Athletics in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Williams won gold in the 200 metres (m), 400 m, 4 × 100 m relay, and 4 × 400 m relay events for competitors under the age of 17, and the silver medal for the 4 × 100 m relay among competitors younger than 20.

==Achievements in track and field==
==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
In 1985, Roberto Rivera, a scout for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB), discovered Williams and Williams&#x27; friend, Juan González. Though Rivera was not interested in González, who he perceived as not taking the game seriously, he wanted to sign Williams. However, Williams was a few months shy of his 17th birthday, when he would become eligible to sign with an MLB team. The Yankees put Williams in a training camp in Connecticut, near the home of scouting director Doug Melvin, who later had González on his Texas Rangers teams. After playing a few games in the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League on the Katz Sports Shop team, Williams was officially signed by the Yankees on his 17th birthday.

While playing in Minor League Baseball, Williams took a course on biology at the University of Puerto Rico, and considered undertaking a pre-medical track as an undergraduate student. Deciding that he could not excel at baseball and medicine at the same time, Williams decided to focus on baseball. Playing for Double-A Albany-Colonie Yankees, he continued to develop his athletic skills – particularly as a switch hitter. Although viewed as a great prospect by Yankee management, his rise to the majors was delayed by the solid outfield — Roberto Kelly, Danny Tartabull, and Jesse Barfield — that the team had developed in the early 1990s.

===New York Yankees (1991–2006)===
Williams managed to break into the majors in 1991 to replace the injured Roberto Kelly for the second half of that season. He batted .238 in 320 at bats. He was demoted to the minors until Danny Tartabull was injured, and Williams earned his stay at center by putting up solid numbers.

Williams had become the regular Yankees center fielder by 1993. However, Williams got off to a slow start that season, and Yankees&#x27; owner George Steinbrenner, impatient with Williams, insisted that Gene Michael, the team&#x27;s general manager, trade him. Michael discussed trading Williams for Larry Walker with the Montreal Expos, but did not make the trade. In his first full season with the Yankees, Williams had a .268 batting average.

Throughout the early 1990s, Williams hit in the middle of the order as management tried to figure out where his best fit was.

====1995–1998====

Manager Buck Showalter helped keep Williams with the Yankees through 1995, when Steinbrenner became frustrated by the team&#x27;s difficulty in placing Williams in any of the traditional baseball player molds. He had good speed, but rarely stole bases. In center, he was highly capable at tracking down fly balls and line drives, but had a weak throwing arm. He was a consistent hitter but only had mild home run power.

In 1995, Steinbrenner again considered trading Williams, this time to the San Francisco Giants for Darren Lewis. The Yankees kept Williams, who went on to have a breakout season. He hit 18 home runs and led the team in runs, hits, total bases and stolen bases. Williams continued his hot hitting into the postseason, leading the Yankees with a .429 batting average in the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) against the Seattle Mariners.

After continuing to improve in 1996, Williams again showcased his skills to the baseball world in the postseason. He batted .467 in the ALDS against Texas and played a sparkling center field. He picked up where he left off in the ALCS against Baltimore, belting an 11th-inning walk-off homer in Game 1. Ending the ALCS with a .474 batting average and two homers, he was named the ALCS MVP. While Williams collected just four hits in the 1996 World Series, his clutch homer in the eighth inning of Game 3 helped spark the team&#x27;s comeback from a 2–0 series deficit to capture the team&#x27;s first championship since 1978.

Despite his success, following the 1997 season, Williams again was the subject of trade rumors, this time involving the Detroit Tigers. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; sportswriter Murray Chass, Williams was nearly dealt to the Tigers for a package of young pitchers including Roberto Durán and first round draft pick Mike Drumright. Tigers general manager Randy Smith believed a deal had been reached and an official announcement was close, but Yankees general manager Bob Watson denied that was the case, and Williams remained a Yankee. Watson also discussed Williams with the Chicago Cubs in a potential trade involving Lance Johnson.

During the 1998 season, in which the Yankees went 114–48 to set a then-American League regular-season record, Williams finished with a .339 average, becoming the first player to win a batting title, Gold Glove award, and World Series ring in the same year.

====1999–2004====
After the 1998 season, Williams signed a seven-year, $87.5-million contract with the Yankees, one of the largest in baseball at the time. The Boston Red Sox and Arizona Diamondbacks also bid for Williams on the free agent market. For the length of the contract, the Yankees made the playoffs every single year, and as a result Williams continued to add to his postseason statistics. He currently places in the top 5 of career postseason categories such as hits, runs scored, doubles, home runs, walks, and runs batted in, where he ranks first.

In 1999, Williams recorded 200+ hits for the first time in his career and won his third straight Gold Glove Award. He also finished third in the American League in batting average (.342), third in hits (202), fourth in on-base percentage (.435), fifth in bases on balls (100), and seventh in runs scored (116). The following year, he once again won a Gold Glove Award and set career highs with 30 home runs and 121 runs batted in.

In 2002, Williams won the only Silver Slugger Award of his career, as he hit .333 and recorded a career-high 204 base hits.

====2005====
The last year covered by Williams’ contract, 2005, proved to be a difficult one. He started just 99 games in center field and 22 games as designated hitter, and his already weak arm was more noticeable as his fielding and batting abilities deteriorated. He had a career-worst .321 OBP and batting average on balls in play (.274). As expected, the Yankees announced on August 2, 2005, that they would not pick up the $15 million option on Williams&#x27; contract for the 2006 season, opting to pay a $3.5 million buyout instead. In December, Williams was offered arbitration by team general manager Brian Cashman to allow an additional month for negotiation. On December 22, the Yankees re-signed Williams to a 1-year, $1.5 million contract.

====2006====


In 2006, Williams saw a good amount of playing time in the corner outfield spots with both Hideki Matsui and Gary Sheffield out with wrist injuries, and did spot duty in center field on days when starting center fielder Johnny Damon was given time off to rest, playing more than was expected when he signed his one-year extension with the Yankees in 2006.

Williams played for Puerto Rico in the 2006 MLB World Baseball Classic, joining Carlos Delgado, Carlos Beltrán, Mike Lowell, Javier Vázquez, and José Vidro amongst others representing the U.S. territory in a team managed by St. Louis Cardinals third base coach Jose Oquendo. Williams hit two home runs in the 2006 WBC.

On July 26, 2006, Williams got his 2,300th career hit, becoming the 11th active player in the Majors with 2,300 or more career hits. Williams continued to climb the Yankees record books by hitting his 443rd career double on August 16, 2006, surpassing then-bench coach Don Mattingly for second-most as a Yankee. For the year, he walked only 7.3% of the time, a career-worst.

====Out of contract====
Williams&#x27; contract expired at the end of the 2006 season. He had hoped to return to the Yankees in 2007 and was willing to accept a role as a back-up outfielder and pinch hitter. The Yankees offered Williams an invitation to spring training as a non-roster invitee, giving him a chance to compete for a job. Williams, however, wanted a guaranteed roster spot and declined the invitation.

On September 21, 2008, Williams made his first return to Yankee Stadium since 2006 for the ceremonies preceding the final game at the stadium. He was the last former player to be introduced and received a standing ovation that lasted a minute and 42 seconds.

====2009 World Baseball Classic====

After two years of inactivity, Williams returned to action in 2008, playing for the Gigantes de Carolina in the Puerto Rico Baseball League. He was interested in gauging his condition prior to possibly participating in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. MLB.com reported on December 30, 2008, that Williams had injured his quad while playing for Carolina and may not be able to play in the World Baseball Classic for Puerto Rico.

On February 19, 2009, Williams worked out with the Yankees at the team&#x27;s spring training complex. Williams hinted that if he performed well in the World Baseball Classic he might consider returning to the Yankees.

In March 2009 he played for Puerto Rico in the World Baseball Classic, going 0-for-5 with two walks; after the series concluded, he expressed interest in playing in the Major Leagues again.

====Retirement====
Though he did not appear in a Major League Baseball game after 2006, Williams did not officially retire until 2015. At the February 2011 retirement press conference for Andy Pettitte, Williams acknowledged that his career was over and stated that he would officially announce his retirement soon thereafter. Williams officially retired on April 24, 2015, with the Yankees.

Williams appeared on the Hall of Fame ballot for the first time in 2012. He received 55 votes for 9.6%. The next year, Williams received 19 votes (3.3%). Since he received votes on fewer than 5% of ballots, Williams was not eligible to appear on future ballots.

The Yankees announced in May 2014 that they would honor Williams with a plaque in Monument Park during the 2015 season. On February 16, 2015, the Yankees also announced that they would be retiring Williams&#x27; number 51. On May 24, the Yankees unveiled Williams&#x27;s plaque and retired his number in a ceremony at Yankee Stadium.

==Music career==

A classically trained guitarist, Williams plays and composes music with influences that include jazz, classical, pop, Brazilian, and Latin sounds.

Williams signed with Paul McCartney&#x27;s publishing company, MPL Communications, and his major label debut, &quot;The Journey Within&quot;, was released on June 22, 2003.
In addition to playing lead and rhythm guitar, Williams composed seven songs for the album. Tracks like &quot;La Salsa En Mi&quot; and &quot;Desvelado&quot; mix his love of jazz with Latin rhythms. The first single was a remix of his &quot;Just Because,&quot; featuring David Benoit. Other highlights include Williams&#x27; heartfelt tribute to his father, &quot;Para Don Berna;&quot; a reworking of the Baden Powell song, &quot;Samba Novo;&quot; and &quot;La Salsa En Mi,&quot; featuring background vocals from 2003 Grammy Award winner Rubén Blades and salsa legend Gilberto Santa Rosa. Also joining Williams was an all-star ensemble of musicians including multiple Grammy-winning banjo player Béla Fleck, keyboardist David Sancious, percussionist Luis Conte, bassist Leland Sklar, guitarist Tim Pierce, and drummers Kenny Aronoff and Shawn Pelton, among others.

Following his career with the New York Yankees, Williams studied guitar and composition for a year at the State University of New York at Purchase in preparation for his album, &quot;Moving Forward&quot;, which was released on April 14, 2009, under the Reform Records label. The album features fourteen tracks and includes some collaborative tracks with other artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Patti Scialfa, Jon Secada, and Dave Koz. Williams was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award for &quot;Moving Forward&quot;.

In 2010, Williams participated in the World Rhythms Tour with Basia. On July 18, 2010, he performed at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games opening ceremony.

In July 2011, the book &quot;Rhythms of the Game: The Link Between Musical and Athletic Performance&quot;, co-authored by Williams, Dave Gluck, and Bob Thompson, with a foreword by Paul Simon, was published by Hal Leonard Publishing.

Williams was featured on the November/December 2011 cover of &quot;Making Music&quot; to discuss his life and career in music.

Williams received his Bachelor of Music from the Manhattan School of Music on May 13, 2016.

==Philanthropy==
Williams&#x27; love of music shines through in his philanthropy efforts with Little Kids Rock, a national nonprofit organization that works to restore and revitalize music education in disadvantaged U.S. public schools. Little Kids Rock honored the Yankees icon with the 2010 &quot;Big Man of the Year&quot; award at the annual Right to Rock celebration. Williams performed onstage with students and signed some guitars to be auctioned. With the money he helped raise, Williams delivered instruments to a school in the Bronx and gave the students a lesson in music and life.

In August 2015 Williams and sports marketer Brandon Steiner made a surprise visit to Camp Adventure, where they helped revive the music program of KiDS NEED MORE, a charitable organization dedicated to creating camping experiences for children, families, and young adults coping with cancer and life-threatening illnesses. The surprise visit aired on September 15, 2015, on the YES Network on &quot;The Hook-Up: Camp Adventure&quot;.

In July 2018, Williams went to Puerto Rico to take part in a special episode of &quot;Bar Rescue&quot; on the Paramount Network to help people affected by Hurricane Maria, rebuilding a bar and baseball field.

==Personal life==
Williams married Waleska on February 23, 1990 and had three children: Bernie Jr., Beatriz, and Bianca. A song on Williams&#x27; 2009 release, &quot;Moving Forward&quot;, is named after Beatriz: &quot;Lullaby for Beatriz.&quot; This song is performed by Williams with his brother, Hiram Williams, playing the cello. This song was recorded in Puerto Rico at the Alpha Recording Studios.

On June 14, 2018, Williams stated he was divorced during an interview on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Highly Questionable&quot;.

Williams appeared on an episode of the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as himself.

<text>Amfreville () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France.

==Geography==
Amfreville is located some 25 km north-west of Caen and 1 km south-east of Ouistreham mostly on the right bank of the Orne with a small portion on the left bank. It can be accessed by the D514 from Sallenelles in the north passing through the west of the commune then continuing south then west to Bénouville. Access to the village is by the D37B from Breville-les-Monts in the south-east and continuing through the village north to Sallenelles. There is also the D236 going east from the village to Bavent. There are several hamlets apart from the village: Hameau Oger and Hameau La Rue form a continuous urban area with the main village and the hamlets of La Basse Ecarde and La Haute Ecarde are to the west. The rest of the commune and the entire left bank of the Orne portion are farmland.

The Orne river separates the two parts of the commune with no direct access across the river - the nearest crossing is on the D514 to the south of the commune. A stream forms the northern border of the commune flowing into the Orne.

==History==

Amfreville is located close to Sword Beach on the Normandy coast, which is one of the beaches where the Allies executed their Normandy landings. It is also close to the important medieval city of Caen, which figured in the Allied landings. Amfreville is considered to have been officially &quot;liberated&quot; from the German occupation of World War II on 6 June 1944.

Amfreville is understood to be the ancestral home of the Umfraville family of Anglo-Norman nobles who occupied England under William the Conqueror and his successors, and went on to become British nobility under the titles &quot;the Barons of Prudhoe&quot; and the &quot;Lords of Redesdale&quot;, and later also gained Scottish lands and the title &quot;Earl of Angus&quot;.

Images of these historical associations with the Norman Conquest of 1066 and the Normandy Landings of 1944 are incorporated in the town&#x27;s heraldry.

<text>Anctoville () is a former commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France. On 1 January 2017, it was merged into the new commune called Aurseulles.

==Geography==
Anctoville is located some 30 km south-west of Caen and 5 km north-west of Villers-Bocage in the Bessin area of the Seulles valley. It can be accessed by the D67 road from Saint-Germain-d&#x27;Ectot in the north passing through the village and continuing south-east to Villers-Bocage. The D92 road also passes through the length of the commune and the village from south-west to north-east. In the north-east of the commune, the D33 road from Longraye in the north passes through and continues south-east to Villers-Bocage. Finally, in the north-east is also the D173A road connecting the D92 and the D67. The commune consists entirely of farmland except for two small areas of forest in the north.

The &quot;Ruisseau des Landes&quot; forms a part of the northern border. &quot;Le Candon&quot; stream passes through the commune flowing towards the north-east and forming part of the northern border of the commune. &quot;Le Seulles&quot; stream forms part of the southern border before flowing just south of the village then continuing north-east to form most of the eastern border joining Le Candon at the northern tip of the commune. The &quot;Ruisseau David&quot; forms the south-eastern border and flows north to join Le Seulles. &quot;Le Gallichon&quot; stream also forms part of the southern border before joining Le Seulles in the south.

==History==
The name Anctoville comes from &quot;Asketillville,&quot; meaning &quot;&quot;Anquetil farm&quot; (&quot;Anquetovillethen laterAnctoville&quot;). Cf. Ancretteville-sur-Mer.

The former name of Anctoville was &quot;Coisnières&quot; or &quot;Cornières&quot; until 1616. Olivier Foulognes, the King&#x27;s butler, bought the Lordship of Cornières and obtained a change of name. This fief became part of the Bailiwick of Briquessart. The oldest document showing the Parish of Coisnières dates back to the 12th century. It was a charter of confirmation of goods given by Henry, King of England and Duke of Normandy, at Lessay.

In June 1944, during the Battle of Villers-Bocage, Orbois castle housed the headquarters of the German armoured division Panzer Lehr commanded by Fritz Bayerlein. Anctoville was liberated on 1 August 1944 by the British 61st Reconnaissance Battalion. These events inspired a scenario in the video game &quot;Call of Duty 2&quot; on the Xbox 360.

In 1973, Anctoville (population 394 in 1968) merged with Feuguerolles-sur-Seulles (with 70 inhabitants to the east of the territory), Orbois (120 inhabitants in the north), and Sermentot (182 inhabitants in the north-east). The communes retained the status of Associated communes of France.

The mayor was assisted by two deputies.

==Demography==
The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Anctovillais&quot; or &quot;Anctovillaises&quot; in French. Anctoville itself had 1,210 inhabitants in 1806. The four communes that merged in 1973 had a total of 2,608 inhabitants in 1836 (1,173 in Anctoville, 299 in Feuguerolles-sur-Seulles, 233 in Orbois, and 903 in Sermentot).

At the communal inventory of 1998, it had 46 farms, 28 of which were of a professional standard classified by INSEE, for an area of 1,848 hectares used. There were 68 farms in 1988. The main production is the raising of cattle for milk and meat. Arable land is used for forage and grain crops.

==Culture and heritage==

<text>Brady: United Against Gun Violence (formerly “Handgun Control, Inc”., the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence) is an American nonprofit organization that advocates for gun control and against gun violence. It is named after former White House press secretary James &quot;Jim&quot; Brady, who was permanently disabled and later died in 2014 as a result of the Ronald Reagan assassination attempt of 1981, and his wife Sarah Brady, who was a chairwoman of the organization from 1989 until her death in 2015.

Brady was founded in 1974 as the National Council to Control Handguns (NCCH). From 1980 through 2000, it operated under the name Handgun Control, Inc. (HCI). In 2001, it was renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, and its sister project, the center to Prevent Handgun Violence, was renamed the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The nonprofits rebranded as Brady in February 2019, on the 25th anniversary of the implementation of the Brady Bill.

== History ==
In 1974, the National Council to Control Handguns (NCCH) was founded by armed-robbery victim Mark Borinsky, a graduate of Johns Hopkins University. In 1975, Republican marketing manager Pete Shields, whose 23-year-old son had been murdered, joined NCCH as chairman. In 1980, the organization became Handgun Control, Inc. (HCI) and partnered with the National Coalition to Ban Handguns (NCBH). The partnership did not last long; the NCBH, renamed in 1990 as the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV), generally advocates for stricter gun laws than does the Brady Campaign.

HCI had few resources until 1980, after the murder of musician John Lennon increased the public&#x27;s interest in shootings. By 1981, HCI&#x27;s membership exceeded 100,000. In 1983, the center to Prevent Handgun Violence (CPHV) was founded as an educational outreach organization and sister project. In 1989, CPHV established the Legal Action Project to press its agenda in the courts.

In 2001, Handgun Control, Inc. was renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, and the center to Prevent Handgun Violence was renamed the Brady Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, in honor of both Jim and Sarah Brady. The same year, the Million Mom March (MMM) was incorporated into the Brady Campaign.

== Leadership ==

=== Current ===
In September 2017, Kris Brown and Avery W. Gardiner assumed the roles of co-president, replacing Dan Gross. Brown was named the organization&#x27;s sole president in November 2018. Liz Dunning, whose mother was randomly murdered by a serial killer in 2003, is the vice president for development.

=== Former ===
Mark Borinsky founded the National Council to Control Handguns in 1974. He served as chair until 1976. Charlie Orasin was a key player in the founding and growth of Handgun Control (HCI). He worked at HCI from 1975 until 1992.

Nelson &quot;Pete&quot; Shields became the organization&#x27;s chairman in 1978 and retired in 1989. In July 1976, Shields estimated that it would take seven to ten years for NCCH to reach the goal of &quot;total control of handguns in the United States.&quot; He said: &quot;The first problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns being produced and sold in this country. The second is to get handguns registered. And the final problem is to make the possession of &quot;all&quot; handguns and &quot;all&quot; handgun ammunition – except for the military, policemen, licensed security guards, licensed sporting clubs, and licensed gun collectors – totally illegal.&quot; In 1987 Shields said that he believed &quot;in the right of law-abiding citizens to possess handguns... for legitimate purposes.&quot;.

Richard Aborn served as president from 1992 until 1996 and went on to form the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City.

Jim and Sarah Brady were both influential in the movement since at least the mid-1980s. Mrs. Brady became chair in 1989, and the Bradys became the namesakes of the organization in 2000.

Former Maryland congressman Michael D. Barnes was the president of the Brady Campaign from 2000 to May 2006.

Former Fort Wayne, Indiana, mayor Paul Helmke served from July 2006 to July 2011. In November 2008, Brady president Helmke, a former Republican mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana, endorsed the American Hunters and Shooters Association saying, &quot;I see our issues as complementary to theirs.&quot; He said, &quot;The Brady Campaign is not just East Coast liberal Democrats.&quot;

Dan Gross was president from February 2012 to September 2017. He is one of the founders of the Center to Prevent Youth Violence (formerly PAX).

== Political advocacy ==

=== Undetectable Firearms Act ===
In 1988, HCI supported Congress in passing the Undetectable Firearms Act, which banned the manufacture, possession and transfer of firearms with less than 3.7 oz of metal, after the emergence of &quot;plastic&quot; handguns like Glock pistols.

Critics said that so-called &quot;plastic&quot; handguns contain many metal components (such as the slide, barrel and ammunition) and can be detected by conventional screening technologies. Their response was to say the type of polymer used in the firearms is opaque to X-ray scanners, which would&#x27;ve hidden the metal components.

=== Brady Law ===
HCI was the chief supporter of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, commonly known as the Brady Law, enacted in 1993 after a seven-year debate. It successfully lobbied for passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, banning the manufacture and importation of so-called military-style assault weapons.

=== Castle and stand-your-ground laws ===
In May 2005, Florida passed a stand-your-ground law that authorized persons attacked in any place they were lawfully present to use lethal force in self-defense without a duty to retreat. Brady Campaign workers passed out fliers at Miami International Airport offering tips like &quot;Do not argue unnecessarily with local people.&quot; The group also published ads in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;, and &quot;The Detroit Free Press&quot; saying: &quot;Thinking about a Florida vacation? Please ensure your family is safe.&quot; In 2006, when similar laws were enacted or proposed in other states, the Brady Campaign and other critics warned they could result in vigilantism.

=== &quot;Heller&quot; and &quot;McDonald&quot; cases ===
After the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2010 in &quot;McDonald v. Chicago&quot;, Brady president Paul Helmke said he was &quot;pleased that the Court reaffirmed its language in &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot; that the Second Amendment individual right to possess guns in the home for self-defense does not prevent our elected representatives from enacting &#x27;common-sense&#x27; gun laws to protect our communities from gun violence.&quot;

=== Lawsuits ===
On March 19, 2009, a federal judge ordered a temporary injunction blocking the implementation of the rule allowing concealed carry permit holders to carry firearms concealed within National Park Service lands within states where their permits are valid, based upon environmental concerns, in response to efforts by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the National Parks Conservation Association, and the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees. On May 20, 2009, the injunction was overturned by the passing of an amendment to the Credit CARD Act of 2009, added by Senator Tom Coburn (R, OK) over the objections of the Brady Campaign.

=== Sandy Hook school shooting aftermath ===
In the month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the Brady Campaign raised about $5 million and renewed public interest in passing legislation to reduce gun violence. The Brady Campaign has continued to promote federal reform legislation, including an expansion of the national background check program. Its leadership met with President Obama and Vice President Biden to craft a package of bills aimed at reducing gun violence.

=== Aurora, Colorado theater shooting ===
In 2014, the parent and step-parent of one of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting victims, represented by Brady Center lawyers, filed suit against the companies from whom James Holmes purchased the ammunition, magazines, and body armor he used in the shooting. In 2015, the judge in the case dismissed the suit on the grounds that such a lawsuit is in violation of both Colorado law and the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act because the guns and ammunition obtained from the online companies, including Lucky Gunner and The Sportsman&#x27;s Guide, worked as claimed. He also ordered the plaintiffs to pay the legal costs of the defendants, which came to $280,000. As the Brady Center lawyers would be expected to know applicable case law in such a lawsuit, it is not clear whether the Brady Center or the plaintiffs themselves are responsible for paying the judgment.

=== Assault weapons ===
The Brady Campaign contends that self-loading and select-fire weapons are virtually identical since a semi-automatic rifle may be fired rapidly.

<text>Gnaw Bone is an unincorporated community in Washington Township, Brown County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. Gnaw Bone is situated on State Highway 46, between Nashville and Columbus. The small community contains three flea markets.

==Origin of name==
The origin of the name Gnaw Bone is obscure. One theory is that the town&#x27;s name derives from that of the original French settlement in the area, &quot;Narbonne&quot;, named in turn for the southern French city of that name. To the ears of English settlers at the time, &quot;Narbonne&quot; sounded like and came to be known as &quot;Gnaw Bone.&quot;

The name was in common use as early as 1879, as shown by newspaper articles in the Columbus (Indiana) Republic and the Cincinnati (Ohio) Enquirer, as well as numerous other newspapers articles up to the current year.

Gnaw Bone has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.

<doc id="486682" wikidata="Q5036806" url="?curid=486682" title="Captain Spaulding">
<text>Captain Jeffrey T. Spaulding is a fictional character in the Broadway musical &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; and the film of the same name. He was originally played by actor Groucho Marx, one of the Marx Brothers, in both productions. Despite his middle name being Edgar, he is known as Jeffrey T. Spaulding; his first name is also spelled as &quot;Geoffrey&quot; in parts of the film.

Spaulding had a theme song entitled &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding&quot;, composed by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, which all of the guests sing upon his arrival. This song would go on to be associated with Marx for the rest of his life in public; it was the theme for his television series &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; and was often played when he was introduced as a guest on television shows. At Marx&#x27;s Carnegie Hall concert in the early 1970s, accompanist Marvin Hamlisch played the song as Marx made his entrance onstage.

==Role in &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;==
Spaulding is a famous explorer on return from a trek across Africa to be the guest of honour at a high-society party given by the wealthy dowager Mrs. Rittenhouse (Margaret Dumont). She frequently claims that Spaulding is one of the most courageous travellers in the world, yet by his own accounts of his safari, he reveals his cowardice. At the party, which is taking place over a weekend, a valuable painting is stolen, and he, along with the police and his secretary Jamison (Zeppo Marx), try to recover it.

==In popular culture==
In the 1939 Marx Brothers&#x27; film &quot;At the Circus&quot;, J. Cheever Loophole (also played by Groucho Marx) sings a rendition of &quot;Lydia the Tattooed Lady&quot; and one line references Lydia having a tattoo of Captain Spaulding exploring the Amazon.

The character Capt. Calvin Spaulding from the television show &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, played by Loudon Wainwright III, was named after the Marx character.

The horror film character Captain Spaulding, who appears in several works by Rob Zombie (including &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot;, and &quot;3 From Hell&quot;), is named after the Marx character.

A chorus on people disguised as the character appears in Woody Allen&#x27;s movie &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot;.

<doc id="486696" wikidata="Q680332" url="?curid=486696" title="Annebault">
<text>Annebault () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

== Geography ==
Annebault is located in the pays d&#x27;Auge, 17 kilometers from Lisieux.

== Toponymy ==

The village Annebault was first mentioned as &quot;Olnebac&quot; in the beginning of the 12th century, and as &quot;Ounebaus&quot; in 1195.

Several different theories have been proposed to explain the origins of this name. French linguist René Lepelley has proposed that the name comes from the Old Norrois &quot;almr balkr&quot;, or &quot;splitting of the elm&quot;. On the other hand, Ernest Nègre, toponymist and specialist in Occitan, has offered that it is derived from the Germanic personal name &quot;Allinus&quot; followed by the Old Norse &quot;bekkr&quot;. Yet another theory, courtesy of Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing, holds that Annebault derives from the Germanic personal name &quot;Hanno&quot; followed by Germanic &quot;bald&quot;, or &quot;bold&quot;. Ultimately, despite this plethora of suggestions, the origins of &quot;Annebault&quot; remain obscure.

== History==

The vestiges of a feudal moat, possibly dating to the tenth century, can be found to the south of the town, in the nearby forest.

==Population==
== Personalities==

Claude d&#x27;Annebault (circa 1495-1552) was a French military man who became an admiral and was named Admiral of France in 1544.

<text>Argences () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France. It is in the urban area of Caen, 15 kilometres from the city.

The commune has been awarded one flower by the &quot;National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom&quot; in the &quot;Competition of cities and villages in Bloom&quot;.

==Geography==
Argences is some 15 km south-east of Caen and 1 km north of Moult. Access to the commune is by the D37 road from Saint-Pair in the north passing through the commune and the town and continuing to Moult in the south. The D41 road goes east from the town to join the D613 to Caen at Vimont. The D80 road also goes north-east from the town to Saint-Pierre-du-Jonquet. Apart from the town there are also the hamlets of Le Fresne to the north, Le Mesnil in the north-east, and Le Croix de Moult south of the town. The commune consists of a large residential area in the town with a large forest in the north-east (the Bois de Saint-Gilles) with small scattered forests but mostly farmland.

The &quot;Muane&quot; river flows through the town and the commune from south to north.

== History ==
In 989, Richard I of Normandy donated land to the Abbey of Fécamp for the curates of Mondeville and Argences. From that date, the domain of Mondeville was managed as an ecclesiastical fief by the Barony of Argences. During the ducal era the wines of Argences were highly regarded.

In 1912, the large tile factory at Fresne built a railway line 4 km long connecting Argences to Moult-Argences Station in Moult on the Paris-Cherbourg line. The line from Argences was closed in 1931 and the nearest station is now Moult-Argences (TER Basse-Normandie).

On 16 April 1942, a group of resistance fighters derailed a Maastricht-Cherbourg train two kilometres from Moult-Argences station in Airan commune causing 28 dead and 19 wounded - all German soldiers. On 30 April of that year, in revenge for German retaliation, a new derailment of the same train killed 10 German soldiers and wounded 22 others.

<doc id="486704" wikidata="Q229766" url="?curid=486704" title="Shohreh Aghdashloo">
<text>Shohreh Aghdashloo (, )) is an Iranian and American actress. She has received various accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award and a Satellite Award, in addition to a nomination for an Academy Award.

Following numerous starring roles on the stage, she made her film debut in &quot;Chess of the Wind&quot; (1976). Her next two films &quot;The Report&quot; (1977) and &quot;Sooteh Delan&quot; (1977) garnered critical acclaim and established Aghdashloo as one of Iran&#x27;s leading ladies, although the films were banned in Iran itself. Aghdashloo moved to England during the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and then to the United States, subsequently becoming a U.S. citizen. After several years playing small roles in television and film, her performance in &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; (2003) brought her several film critics&#x27; awards and a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other film appearances include &quot;The Exorcism of Emily Rose&quot; (2005), &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; and &quot;The Nativity Story&quot; (both 2006), &quot;The Odd Life of Timothy Green&quot; (2013) and &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; (2016).

In television, she is best known for her roles as Dina Araz in the fourth season of &quot;24&quot; and as Chrisjen Avasarala on &quot;The Expanse&quot; (2015–2022). For her role as Sajida Talfah in the HBO miniseries &quot;House of Saddam&quot; (2008), she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. In 2013, she released her autobiography titled &quot;The Alley of Love and Yellow Jasmines&quot;. In 2021, she voiced Grayson in Netflix&#x27;s series &quot;Arcane&quot;. In 2024, Aghdashloo voiced the unnamed dragon in the 2024 Netflix film &quot;Damsel.&quot; She also voices Roshan in &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage&quot;.

== Early life ==
Aghdashloo earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in international relations at Brunel University because of her interest in politics after having to leave her home country. She was already familiar with England, as her parents had taken her to London as a child. She then continued to pursue her acting career, which brought her to Los Angeles. She has since performed in a number of Touzie&#x27;s plays, successfully taking them to national and international stages, primarily in the Iranian diaspora. Though born to a Muslim family, she has stated that she is non-practicing.

== Career ==
Aghdashloo first began working as a theatre actress at the age of 19, when she starred in a theatrical adaptation of the novel &quot;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot; (1973). Aghdashloo made her American film debut in 1989 in a starring role in &quot;Guests of Hotel Astoria&quot;. Her television debut came on September 25, 1990, in a guest role in the two-hour episode of the NBC television series &quot;Matlock&quot;, titled &quot;Nowhere to Turn: A Matlock Mystery Movie&quot;. In the years that followed Aghdashloo appeared on screen sporadically, including in the widely panned &quot;Surviving Paradise&quot; (2000), written and directed by Kamshad Kooshan.

In 2001 Aghdashloo was cast opposite Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly in director Vadim Perelman&#x27;s &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; (2003) for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Following this exposure Aghdashloo had a prominent recurring role in Season 4 of the Fox television series &quot;24&quot;, playing Dina Araz, a terrorist undercover in Los Angeles as a well-to-do housewife and mother. In an interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Aghdashloo stated that although she had previously resisted reinforcing the stereotype of Muslims as terrorists, the strength and complexity of the role convinced her to accept it. In the period that followed, Aghdashloo made guest appearances on several well-known television series, such as &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. She also played supporting roles in films such as &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; as Dr. Kavita Rao, &quot;The Lake House&quot;, &quot;The Nativity Story&quot; as Elizabeth, and &quot;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2&quot;.

In 2008, Aghdashloo served as an official festival judge at the second annual Noor Iranian Film Festival in Los Angeles, while she also played the lead character of Zahra Khanum in the film &quot;The Stoning of Soraya M.&quot;, marking her first leading role in a feature-length American film. Film scholar Hamid Naficy criticized her role in the film as &quot;discredit[ing] her vow not to play in films that stereotype Middle Easterners, including Iranians.&quot; In the same year, she also portrayed Sajida Talfah in the HBO original miniseries &quot;House of Saddam&quot; for which she received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. Speaking to a crowd of over 1,400 people at George Washington University&#x27;s Lisner Auditorium on September 12, 2009, Aghdashloo, author Dr. Azar Nafisi, and Dr. Dwight Bashir, Associate Director for Policy at the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, added their voices to those concerned about human rights in Iran and the persecution of Baháʼís in Iran. Aghdashloo&#x27;s talk in particular was posted to YouTube. On October 9, 2010, the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans awarded Aghdashloo their Career Achievement Award during its first annual gala.
Agdashloo continues to act in films, such as &quot;The Odd Life of Timothy Green&quot;, &quot;Septembers of Shiraz&quot; and &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;; and on television, guest starring on series such as &quot;House, M.D.&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Grimm&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot;. She also voiced characters for the video games &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot;, &quot;Mass Effect 3&quot;, &quot;Destiny&quot; &quot;Destiny 2&quot;, and &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage&quot;; starred in the London revival of the play &quot;The House of Bernarda Alba&quot; at the Almeida Theatre as Bernarda Alba; and narrated the audiobook &quot;And the Mountains Echoed&quot;, by Khaled Hosseini.

From 2015 to 2022, Aghdashloo starred in Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s television series &quot;The Expanse&quot; as UN Deputy Undersecretary of Executive Administration Chrisjen Avasarala, a &quot;smart and passionate member of a political family legacy who has risen high in the ranks of Earth&#x27;s governing body without once standing for election&quot;. In 2025, she will portray Elaida a&#x27;Roihan in season three of the Amazon series &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;.

<text>Asnelles () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France.

==Geography==
Asnelles is located at the seaside some 13 km north-east of Bayeux and 10 west of Courseulles-sur-Mer. Access to the commune is by the D514 road from Saint-Côme-de-Fresné in the west passing through the town and continuing to Ver-sur-Mer in the east. The D65 road from Arromanches to Meuvaines passes through the south of the commune. The D65A links the D514 to the D65. A large part of the commune is residential with the sea shore fully urban but some 50% of the commune is farmland.

The Gronde river passes through the heart of the commune from south to north emptying into the English Channel.

==History==
Tradition says that William the Conqueror, to escape his pursuers and after having taken refuge at the house of Baron Hubert de Ryes, regained his ducal castle by following small sunken pathways including one that now bears the name of &quot;Sente au Bâtard&quot; (Sente the Bastard). This footpath is difficult in places and it crosses the Gronde, bypassing part of the village, and leads to old farmhouses and old stone houses at Creully.

The name &quot;Asnelles&quot; (from the Latin &quot;asinellas&quot; meaning &quot;little donkeys&quot;) appears for the first time in an official document at the end of the 12th century when work began on the early church dedicated to St. Martin. At that time a market for donkeys stood in the field opposite the church near the public square &quot;planître&quot;. The coastline was then a large swamp which often caused fevers: people would implore the protection of Saint Honorine in a small chapel built on the ruins of a Gallo-Roman Villa which would be located near the modern cemetery.

Until the end of the 17th century there was a small harbour at the mouth of the Gronde called Port Heurtault which had nearly 2,000 boat movements per year of boats involved in coastal shipping or Cabotage. The port was silted up by a storm, so that the &quot;Amirauté Court&quot; or Maritime Court, which was created in 1554 at Asnelles, was transferred to Bayeux. During the 18th century, Asnelles was the seat of a &quot;Captainerie&quot; (Official residence of the officer of the port) and a coastal militia was responsible for monitoring the sea and reporting the approach of any English ship.

In the middle of the 19th century the village underwent major changes. Under the leadership of the Mayor, Dr. Théodore Labbey, significant work was undertaken including: the draining of marshes, the construction of a Levee, and many large houses - some of which remain today. Asnelles becomes &quot;Asnelles-la-Belle-Plage&quot;, a name given by many swimmers at the beach which took the appearance of a &quot;small Trouville&quot;, according to the newspapers of the time, with its casino and its up-market hotels. The beach resort was served by the Chemins de fer du Calvados (Railways of Calvados) from 1899 to 1932. The construction of a Preventorium for children with tuberculosis who had a parent working at the SNCF was imposed on the commune in 1926. Until the eve of the Second World War it accommodated more than 1,500 boys and girls.

On D-Day 6 June 1944, British soldiers landed at Asnelles: the 231st Infantry Brigade was commanded by General Sir Alexander Stanier. The Dorset Regiment, which made landfall at 7:25am, was the first British regiment to set foot in Normandy. They were followed by the Devonshire and Hampshire regiments, as well as the 47th Commando of Royal Marines. The village was liberated in the afternoon with heavy losses mainly due to a 77 mm cannon which covered all the beach on the eastern side. On 10 June the Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) &quot;ALG B-1&quot; was operational at Asnelles-sur-Mer off Gold Beach, the first Allied airfield on the continent, operating Supermarine Spitfires.

Immediately after the landing the construction of the Mulberry harbour at Arromanches began of which the eastern part was at Asnelles consisting of the Phoenix caissons which enclosed the port on the eastern side starting from the commune beach.

The spokesman of General de Gaulle, who was one of the &quot;Voices of France&quot;, Maurice Schumann also landed at Asnelles. He now is buried in the nearby cemetery of Calvary. The village recovered slowly from the D-Day operations: many large houses were severely damaged or destroyed: the Levee and the holds suffered greatly and many roads had to be rebuilt. There were however no civilian casualties reported.

Today, economic activity in Asnelles is mainly tourism with many second homes, camping, a leisure park, cottages, and family homes.

<text>A browser war is a competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. The &quot;first browser war&quot; (1995–2001) occurred between proponents of Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, and the &quot;second browser war&quot; (2004–2017) between those favoring Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Google Chrome.

With the introduction of HTML5 in 2008 and CSS 3 in 2011, a new generation of browser wars began, this time considering extensive client-side scripting to the World Wide Web (WWW), and the more widespread use of smartphones and other mobile devices for web browsing. These changes have ensured that browser battles continue among enthusiasts, while the average web user is less affected.

==Background==
Tim Berners-Lee, along with his colleagues at CERN, started the development of the Internet-based hypertext system WWW in 1989. Their studies led to the creation of the HyperText Transfer Protocol, which set the protocols for client-server communication. In 1990, Berners-Lee created the first web browser, WorldWideWeb, subsequently known as Nexus, and made it available for the NeXTstep Operating System, by NeXT.

Other browsers started to surface by the end of 1992, many of which were based on the Libwww library. These included MacWWW/Samba for the Mac and Unix browsers including Line Mode Browser, ViolaWWW, Erwise, and MidasWWW. These browsers were HTML viewers that needed third-party helpers to display multimedia content.

==Mosaic wars==
In 1993, more browsers became available, including Cello, Lynx, tkWWW, and Mosaic. The most influential of these was Mosaic, a multi-platform browser developed at National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). By October 1994, Mosaic was &quot;well on its way to becoming the world&#x27;s standard interface&quot;, according to Gary Wolfe of &quot;Wired&quot;.

Several companies licensed Mosaic to create their commercial browsers, such as AirMosaic, Quarterdeck Mosaic, and Spyglass Mosaic. One of the Mosaic developers, Marc Andreessen, co-founded the Mosaic Communications Corporation and created a new web browser named Mosaic Netscape.

To resolve legal issues with NCSA, the company was renamed Netscape Communications Corporation, and the browser Netscape Navigator. The Netscape browser improved Mosaic&#x27;s usability and reliability and was able to display pages as they loaded. By 1995, helped by the fact that it was free for non-commercial use, the browser dominated the emerging World Wide Web.

Other browsers launched during 1994 included IBM Web Explorer, Navipress, SlipKnot, MacWeb, and Browse.

While Netscape faced new competition from OmniWeb, Eolas WebRouser, UdiWWW, and Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer 1.0, it continued to dominate the market for 1995.

==First browser war (1995–2001) ==
By mid-1995, the World Wide Web had received a great deal of attention in popular culture and the mass media. Netscape Navigator was the most widely used web browser and Microsoft had licensed Mosaic to create Internet Explorer 1.0, which had released with Microsoft Windows 95 Plus! on August 24, 1995.

Unlike Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer 1.0 was available to all Windows users free of charge, including commercial companies. Other companies later followed suit and released their browsers free of charge. Netscape Navigator and competitor products like InternetWorks, Quarterdeck Browser, InterAp, and WinTapestry were bundled with other applications to full Internet suites.

New versions of Internet Explorer (IE) and Netscape (branded as Netscape Communicator) were released often over the following few years. New features were routinely added, including Netscape&#x27;s JavaScript (subsequently replicated by Microsoft as JScript) and proprietary HTML tags such as codice_1 (Navigator) and codice_2 (Internet Explorer).

Internet Explorer 3 offered nearly identical services like its competitor, Netscape, offering scripting support and implemented the market&#x27;s first commercial Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

On September 22, 1997, Internet Explorer 4 was released. The release party in San Francisco featured a ten-foot-tall letter &quot;e&quot; logo. Netscape employees showing up to work the following morning found the logo on their front lawn, paired with greeting card signed &quot;Best wishes, the IE team&quot;. The Netscape employees promptly knocked it over and set a giant figure of their Mozilla dinosaur mascot atop it, holding a sign reading &quot;Netscape 72, Microsoft 18&quot;, referencing the companies&#x27; market share.

During these releases, it was common for web designers to display &quot;best viewed in Netscape&quot; or &quot;best viewed in Internet Explorer&quot; logos. These images often identified a specific browser and commonly linked to a source from which the stated browser could be downloaded. These logos generally recognized the divergence between the standards supported by the browsers and signified which browser was used for testing the pages. In response, supporters of the principle that websites should be compliant with World Wide Web Consortium standards and hence viewable with any browser started the &quot;Viewable with Any Browser&quot; campaign, which employed its logo similar to the partisan ones. Most mainstream websites, however, specified one of Netscape or Internet Explorer as their preferred browser while making some attempt to support minimal functionality on the other.

While Netscape had accrued about 75% of the market share within four months of its release, as a relatively small company deriving the great bulk of its income from what was essentially a single product (Navigator and its derivatives), it was financially vulnerable. Microsoft&#x27;s resources allowed them to make Internet Explorer available without charge, as the revenues from Windows were used to fund its development and marketing. As a result, Internet Explorer was provided free for all Windows and Macintosh users, unlike Netscape, which was free for home and educational use but would require a paid license for business use.

Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer with every copy of Windows, which had over a 95% share of the desktop operating system market in June 2004, allowing the company to obtain market share more easily than Netscape as customers already had Internet Explorer installed as the default browser. At this time, many new computer purchasers had never extensively used a web browser before. Consequently, the buyer did not have anything else to compare with and little motivation to consider alternatives; any difference in browser features or ergonomics paled in comparison with the set of abilities they had gained with access to the Internet and the World Wide Web.

During the United States Microsoft antitrust case in 1998, Intel vice president Steven McGeady testified that a senior executive at Microsoft told him in 1995 of his company&#x27;s intention to &quot;cut off Netscape&#x27;s air supply&quot;, although a Microsoft attorney rejected McGeady&#x27;s testimony as not credible. That same year, Netscape was acquired by America Online for 4.2 billion dollars. Internet Explorer became the new dominant browser, attaining a peak of about 96% of the web browser usage share in 2001.

==Second browser war (2004–2017)==

=== Decline of Netscape and entry of Firefox ===
At the start of Netscape Navigator&#x27;s decline, Netscape open-sourced its browser code and later entrusted it to the newly formed non-profit Mozilla Foundation — a primarily community-driven project to create a successor to Netscape. Development continued for several years with little widespread adoption until a stripped-down browser-only version of the full suite, which included new features such as a separate search bar (which had previously only appeared in the Opera browser), was created. The browser-only version was initially named &quot;Phoenix&quot;, but because of trademark issues that name was changed, first to &quot;Firebird&quot;, then to &quot;Firefox&quot;. Phoenix was chosen because &quot;Phoenix&quot;, implied that it would rise like a phoenix after Netscape Navigator was killed off by Microsoft. This browser became the focus of the Mozilla Foundation&#x27;s development efforts. Mozilla&#x27;s Firefox 1 was released on November 9, 2004, and it then continued to gain an increasing share of the browser market until a peak of around 24% in 2010.

In response, in April 2004, the Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software joined efforts to develop new open-technology standards which add more capability while remaining backward-compatible with existing technologies. The result of this collaboration was the WHATWG, a working group devoted to the fast creation of new standard definitions that would be submitted to the W3C for approval.

The growing number of device/browser combinations in use, legally-mandated web accessibility, as well as the expansion of expected web functionality to essentially require DOM and scripting abilities, including AJAX, made web standards of increasing importance during this era. Instead of advertising their proprietary extensions, browser developers began to market their software based on how closely it adhered to standards.

On December 28, 2007, Netscape announced that support for its Mozilla-derived Netscape Navigator would be discontinued on February 1, 2008, suggesting its users migrate to Mozilla Firefox.
However, on January 28, 2008, Netscape announced that support would be extended to March 1, 2008, and mentioned Flock alongside Firefox as alternatives to its users.

=== Internet Explorer ===
In 2003, Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 would be the last standalone version of its browser. Future enhancements would be dependent on Windows Vista, which would include new tools such as the WPF and XAML to enable developers to build web applications.

On February 15, 2005, Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer 7 would be available for Windows XP SP2 and later versions of Windows by mid-2005. The announcement introduced the new version of the browser as a major upgrade over Internet Explorer 6 SP1.

Microsoft released Internet Explorer 7 on October 18, 2006. It included tabbed browsing, a search bar, a phishing filter, and improved support for web standards (including full support for PNG) — all features already long familiar to Opera and Firefox users. Microsoft distributed Internet Explorer 7 to genuine Windows users (WGA) as a high-priority update through Windows Update. Typical market share analysis showed only a slow uptake of Internet Explorer 7 and Microsoft decided to drop the requirement for WGA and made Internet Explorer 7 available to all Windows users in October 2007. Throughout the two following years, Microsoft worked on Internet Explorer 8. On December 19, 2007, the company announced that an internal build of that version had passed the Acid2 CSS test in &quot;IE8 standards mode&quot; — the last of the major browsers to do so. Internet Explorer 8 was released on March 19, 2009. New features included accelerators, improved privacy protection, a compatibility mode for pages designed for older browsers, and improved support for various web standards. It was the last version of Internet Explorer to be released for Windows XP. Internet Explorer 8 scored 20/100 in the Acid3 test, which was much worse than all major competitors at the time.

In October 2010, StatCounter reported that Internet Explorer had for the first time dropped below 50% market share to 49.87% in their figures. Also, StatCounter reported Internet Explorer 8&#x27;s first drop in usage share in the same month.

Microsoft released Internet Explorer 9 on March 14, 2011. It featured a revamped interface, support for the basic SVG feature set, and partial HTML video support, among other new features. It dropped support for Windows XP, and only ran on Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Phone 7. The company later released Internet Explorer 10 along with Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 in 2012, and an update compatible with Windows 7 followed in 2013. This version dropped Vista and Phone 7 support. The release preview of Internet Explorer 11 was released on September 17, 2013. It supported the same desktops as its predecessor.

Starting in 2015 with the release of Windows 10, Microsoft shifted from Internet Explorer to Microsoft Edge [Legacy] (Commonly referred to as Edge [Legacy]). However, the new browser had failed to capture much popularity, thus Microsoft Edge switched from its own browser engine, EdgeHTML, to Chromium&#x27;s Blink engine in 2020 for all platforms except for iOS, where it kept relying on WebKit due to platform restrictions.

=== Competing desktop and mobile browsers ===
Opera had been a long-time player in the browser wars, known for being lightweight and introducing innovative features such as tabbed browsing and mouse gestures. However, the software was commercial, which hampered its adoption compared to its free rivals until 2005, when the browser became freeware. On June 20, 2006, Opera Software released Opera 9 including an integrated source viewer, a BitTorrent client implementation, and widgets. It was the first Windows browser to pass the Acid2 test. Opera Mini, a mobile browser, has a significant mobile market share. Multiple ports, such as Opera 8.5 for the Nintendo DS and Opera 9 for the Wii, were also released.

On October 24, 2006, Mozilla released Mozilla Firefox 2. It included the ability to reopen recently closed tabs, a session restore feature to resume work where it had been left after a crash, a phishing filter, and a spell-checker for text fields. Mozilla released Firefox 3 on June 17, 2008, with performance improvements and other new features. Firefox 3.5 followed on June 30, 2009, with further performance improvements, native integration of audio and video, and more privacy features.

Apple created forks of the open-source KHTML and KJS layout and JavaScript engines from the KDE Konqueror browser in 2002. They explained that those provided a basis for easier development than other technologies by being small (fewer than 140,000 lines of code), cleanly designed, and standards-compliant. The resulting layout engine became known as WebKit and it was incorporated into the Safari browser that first shipped with Mac OS X v10.3. On June 13, 2003, Microsoft said it was discontinuing Internet Explorer on the Mac platform, and on June 6, 2007, Apple released a beta version of Safari for Microsoft Windows. On April 29, 2010, Steve Jobs wrote an open letter regarding his Thoughts on Flash, and the place it would hold on Apple&#x27;s iOS devices and web browsers. Web developers were tasked with updating their web sites to be mobile-friendly, and while many disagreed with Steve Jobs&#x27;s assessment on Adobe Flash, history would soon prove his point with the poor performance of Flash on Android devices. HTML4 and CSS2 were the standard in most browsers in 2006. However, new features being added to browsers from HTML5 and CSS3 specifications were quickly making their mark by 2010, especially in the emerging mobile browser market where new ways of animating and rendering for various screen sizes were to become the norm. Accessibility would also become a key player for the mobile web.

=== Google Chrome&#x27;s entry ===
Google released the Google Chrome browser on September 1, 2008, using the same WebKit rendering engine as Safari and a faster JavaScript engine called V8. Shortly after, an open-sourced version for the Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux platforms was released under the name Chromium. According to Net Applications, Chrome had gained a 3.6% usage share by October 2009. After the release of the beta for Mac OS X and Linux, the market share had increased rapidly.

During December 2009 and January 2010, &quot;StatCounter&quot; reported that its statistics indicated that Firefox 3.5 was the most popular browser when counting individual browser versions, passing Internet Explorer 7 and 8 by a small margin. This was the first time a browser surpassed the Internet Explorer since the fall of Netscape Navigator. However, this feat, which GeekSmack called the &quot;dethroning of Microsoft and its Internet Explorer 7 browser&quot;, could largely be attributed to the fact that it came at a time when version 8 was replacing version 7 as the dominant Internet Explorer version; no more than two months later Internet Explorer 8 had established itself as the most popular browser again. Other major statistics, such as Net Applications, never reported any other browser having a higher usage share than Internet Explorer if each version of each browser was looked at individually: for example, Firefox 3.5 was reported as the third most popular browser version from December 2009 to February 2010, succeeded by Firefox 3.6 since April 2010, each ahead of Internet Explorer 7 but behind Internet Explorer 6 and 8.

===Google Chrome&#x27;s dominance and evolving web standards ===
On January 21, 2010, Mozilla released Mozilla Firefox 3.6, which introduced a new type of theme display, &#x27;Personas&#x27;. This allowed users to change Firefox&#x27;s appearance with a single click. Version 3.6 also improved JavaScript performance, overall browser responsiveness, and startup times.

Google released Google Chrome 9 on February 3, 2011. New features introduced included support for WebGL, Chrome Instant, and the Chrome Web Store. The company created another seven versions of Chrome that year, finishing with Chrome 16 on December 15, 2011. Google Chrome 17 was released on February 15, 2012. In April 2012, Google browsers (Chrome and Android) became the most used browsers on Wikimedia Foundation sites. By May 21, 2012, StatCounter reported Chrome narrowly overtaking Internet Explorer as the most used browser in the world. However, the market share between Internet Explorer and Chrome meant that Internet Explorer was slightly ahead of Chrome on weekdays up until July 4. At the same time, Net Applications reported Internet Explorer firmly in first place, with Google Chrome almost overtaking Firefox as the second. In 2012, responding to Chrome&#x27;s popularity, Apple discontinued Safari for Windows, making it exclusively available on OS X.

The concept of rapid releases established by Google Chrome prompted Mozilla to do the same for its Firefox browser. On June 21, 2011, Firefox 5.0 was the first rapid release for this browser, finished a mere six weeks after the previous edition. Mozilla created four more whole-number versions throughout the year, finishing with Firefox 9 on December 20, 2011. For those desiring long-term support, Mozilla made an Extended Support Release (ESR) version of Firefox 10 on January 31, 2012. Contrary to the regular version, a Firefox ESR received regular security updates plus occasional new features and performance updates for approximately one year, after which a 12-week grace period was given before discontinuing that version number. Those who continued to use the rapid releases with an active Internet connection were automatically updated to Firefox 11 on March 15, 2012. By the end of 2012, however, Chrome overtook both Internet Explorer and Firefox to become the world&#x27;s most used browser.

During this era, all major web browsers implemented support for HTML video. Supported codecs, however, varied from browser to browser. Then versions of Android, Chrome, and Firefox supported Theora, H.264, and the VP8 version of WebM. Older versions of Firefox omitted H.264 due to it being a proprietary codec, but it was made available beginning in version 17 for Android and version 20 for Windows. Internet Explorer and Safari supported H.264 exclusively on March 14, 2011 with Internet Explorer 9, and on March 18, 2008 with Safari 3.1. However, Theora and VP8 codecs could be manually installed on the desktop versions. Given the popularity of WebKit for mobile browsers, Opera Software discontinued its Presto engine upon the release of Opera 15 on July 2, 2013. The Opera 12 series of browsers were the last to use Presto with its successors using WebKit instead. In 2015, Microsoft discontinued the production of newer versions of Internet Explorer. By this point, Chrome overtook all other browsers as the browser with the highest usage share. Chrome had supported Windows XP until the end of 2015.

By 2017 usage shares of Opera, Firefox and Internet Explorer fell well below 5% each, while Google Chrome had expanded to over 60% worldwide. On May 25, 2017, Andreas Gal, former Mozilla CTO, publicly announced that Google Chrome won the Second Browser War.

==Aftermath==

Due to Google Chrome&#x27;s success, in December 2018, Microsoft announced that they would be building a new version of Edge based on Chromium and powered by Google&#x27;s rendering engine, Blink, rather than their own rendering engine, EdgeHTML. The new Microsoft Edge browser was released on January 15, 2020. Though Firefox showed a slight increase in usage share as of February 2019, it continues to struggle with less than 10% usage share worldwide. By April 2019, worldwide Google Chrome usage share crossed 70% across personal computers and remained over 60% combining all devices. In June 2022, Microsoft permanently retired Internet Explorer in favor of Microsoft Edge as their sole browser. As of January 2023, Microsoft Edge was the 3rd most used web browser having 4.46% as market share. In 2023, Internet Explorer was permanently disabled by Microsoft on most versions of Windows 10.

As of 2023, Microsoft Edge has been noted to promote itself when visiting or searching for Google Chrome. Ignoring user settings, links from Windows integrated features, such as widgets, open in Edge. 

In February 2024, Microsoft silently released the &quot;User Choice Protection Driver&quot; for Windows 10 and 11 that prevent software changes to the default Browser, requiring users make the changes only through Windows settings. In May 2024, a Chrome extension released by Microsoft maintains Bing as the default search engine.

<text>Audrieu () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France.

==Geography==
Audrieu is located some 11 km south-east of Bayeux and 16 km west by north-west of Caen. Access to the commune is by the D 82 road from Ducy-Sainte-Marguerite in the north which passes south through the centre of the commune and the village and continues to Tilly-sur-Seulles in the south. The D 187 branches off the D 82 in the north of the commune and goes west to Chouain. The D 178 branches off the D82 south of the village and goes west to Juaye-Mondaye. The D158 branches off the D 82 in the north of the commune and goes north to Loucelles. The D 94 branches of the D 82 in the village and goes east to Brouay. The railway from Bayeux to Caen passes through the north of the commune with a station at Le Haut des Jardins. Apart from the village there are the hamlets of Lieu Moussard, Hervieu, Le Haut des Jardins, Le Bas d&#x27;Audrieu, Le Calvaire, Ferme de la Motte, Hameau Pavie, and Le Pont Roch. The commune is farmland with residential areas mostly along the D 82.

The &quot;Seulles&quot; river forms the western border of the commune as it flows north to join the ocean at Courseulles-sur-Mer.

==History==
Audrieu village dates back to Classical Antiquity when it was called &quot;Alderium&quot;. There are traces of Gallo-Roman dwellings and a Motte-and-bailey castle. The first lord of the area was Percy, cook for William the Conqueror, who gave it to the descendants of the Duke of Northumberland. In 1593 Audrieu returned to Guillaume de Séran, who married Marguerite de Percy, and whose lordship became a barony in 1615.

After being sold in the French Revolution the château returned to the Séran family at the Restoration and is still in the hands of their descendants. During the Second World War Gerhard Bremer, commandant of the 12th Reconnaissance Battalion of the German army established his headquarters in the château. On 8 June 1944, in clearings, forests, and orchards surrounding the castle, 24 members of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division were executed: 22 from the Royal Winnipeg Rifles and two from the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada. Two British soldiers were killed at the same time. The castle now houses a luxury hotel and restaurant.

<text>Aunay-sur-Odon (, literally &quot;Aunay on Odon&quot;) is a former commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France. On 1 January 2017, it was merged into the new commune Les Monts d&#x27;Aunay.

The commune has been awarded two flowers by the &quot;National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom&quot; in the &quot;Competition of cities and villages in Bloom&quot;.

==Geography==
The commune is located at the foot of the foothills of the Armorican Massif on the Odon river a few kilometres east from its source. It is at the heart of the &quot;Pre-Bocage&quot; country of transition between the Caen plain, the Bessin, and the &quot;Bocage virois&quot; with which it is also connected.

Located at the intersection of several county roads, the agglomeration is south of Villers-Bocage, south-west of Caen, and north-east of Vire. The D8 goes north-east to Bauquay and Caen. The D6 connects Aunay to Villers-Bocage in the north and Thury-Harcourt to the south-east. The D54 joins Cahagnes and Caumont-l&#x27;Éventé in the north-west through the village to Roucamps, Le Plessis-Grimoult, and Condé-sur-Noireau in the south. The D26 goes to Vire via Danvou-la-Ferrière and Estry in the south-west. The D213 goes to Courvaudon in the east with the D234 branching to serve Bonnemaison. The D214 goes north to Longvillers. The D291A goes west to La Bigne.

Aunay-sur-Odon is in the Drainage basin of the Orne by its tributary the Odon which crosses the commune from west to north and which has its source in the neighbouring commune of Ondefontaine. Several small tributaries feed it such as the &quot;Douvette&quot; which marks the boundary with Courvaudon in the east and the &quot;Ruisseau du Val Boquet&quot; on the north-west border.

The highest point of is located in the south on the border with Roucamps in a wood overlooking a place called &quot;Pied de la Bruyère&quot;. The lowest point is at corresponding to the exit of the Odon from the commune to the north. The commune is about one eighth urban, forested throughout the southern part, and Bocage on the rest.

As in all of western France, Aunay-sur-Odon has an oceanic climate. The nearest weather station is at Caen-Carpiquet north-west. Pré-Bocage country however differs in the annual rainfall which in Aunay-sur-Odon is around 950 mm.

==Toponymy==
The name was attested as &quot;castellum Alnei&quot; in 1142. It is derived from the Latin &quot;Alnus&quot; meaning &quot;alder&quot;.

In 1895 the commune of &quot;Aunay&quot; became Aunay-sur-Odon. The Odon passes along the west of the town.

==History==
The town is located that had been already occupied in the Gallo-Roman era as it was at the crossroads of ancient routes from Vieux to Avranches and from Bayeux to Condé-sur-Noireau.

The Roman de Rou by Wace mentions a Lord &quot;of Alnei&quot; said to have participated in the conquest of England along with William the Conqueror. The remains of his castle from the 12th century, overlooking the present &quot;Petit Pied du Bois&quot;, are described in the third volume of the &quot;Monumental statistic of Calvados&quot; by Arcisse de Caumont (1857). The fortress was used until the Hundred Years War and was destroyed by Bertrand du Guesclin.

In 1131 the town had an abbey founded by Jordan and Luce of Say and Richard of Hommet, constable of Normandy. Originally dependent on Savigny Abbey, it became Cistercian at the end of the 12th century. It was heavily damaged in the wars of religion.

On 22 August 1886 the Caen-Aunay-Saint-Georges railway line was opened. It was then extended to Vire on 1 June 1891. Passenger service on the line was suspended on 1 March 1938. Freight service was limited to Jurques then permanently suspended. The line was then decommissioned. Today the &quot;Rue de la Gare&quot; is a reminder of the lost line.


In 1944 due to its position as a crossroads, this time between Caen and Vire and between Bayeux and Falaise, the city suffered two strategic bombardments by the Allies. On 12 June two waves of aircraft destroyed all of the town centre killing a hundred people. On the night of 14 to 15 June the town was totally destroyed by a new wave of bombing. The town was completely destroyed with the precarious bell tower the only remaining building. Over 25% of the inhabitants were killed.

Reconstruction was organized very quickly with the first stone of the new town being laid on 23 November 1947 by Mr. Kerisel, construction manager at the Ministry of Reconstruction and Urbanism. It was completed in 1951 under the leadership of architect P. Dureuil.

<text>Auquainville () is a former commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Livarot-Pays-d&#x27;Auge.

==Geography==
Auquainville is located some 10 km south of Lisieux and 13 km west by north-west of Orbec. Access to the commune is by the D149 road which comes from Saint-Martin-de-Mailloc in the north-east and passes south through the commune and the village continuing to Livarot in the south-west. The D64 road comes from Saint-Martin-de-la-Lieue in the north and passes south through the east of the commune to Fervaques. The D135B branches east off the D64 in the commune and joins the D135 just east of the commune. Apart from the village, there are the hamlets of La Blondeliere in the west with Le Mollants and Le Maubuisson in the east. The commune is mixed forest and farmland with a particularly large forest to the west of the village (the Bois des Grandes Ventes).

The Touques river passes through the commune from south to north just east of the village and continues north to join the ocean at Trouville-sur-Mer. The &quot;Ruisseau de la Marette&quot; rises in the commune and flows east into the Touques.

==History==
In 1831, Auquainville (456 inhabitants) merged with Saint-Aubin-sur-Aquainville (91 inhabitants). Saint-Aubin-sur-Auquainville was south of Auquainville.

<text>Authie () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France.

The commune has been awarded one flower by the &quot;National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom&quot; in the &quot;Competition of cities and villages in Bloom&quot;.

==Geography==
Authie is located some north-west of the centre of Caen. Access to the commune is by road D220 from Villons-les-Buissons in the north-east which passes through the centre of the commune and the village and continues to Carpiquet in the south. The D220C also goes south-east from the village to the urban area of Caen. There are also the hamlets of Hameau de Saint-Louet, Franqueville, Fermie du Calvaire, and Cussy in the commune. Apart from the large residential area the commune is entirely farmland.

==Toponymy==
The name of the town is attested in the forms &quot;Alteium&quot; in 1227 and &quot;Auteya&quot; in 1264.

Albert Dauzat matched &quot;Authie&quot; with &quot;Authie&quot; in Somme department (&quot;Altegiam&quot; 830) on the coastal river Authie (&quot;Alteia&quot; 723) and considers it primarily as a hydronym but does not provide any further explanation.

According to René Lepelley this toponym is based on the pre-Celtic element &quot;alt&quot; in an unknown sense and is close to &quot;Authou&quot; in Pont-Authou.
François de Beaurepaire sees a Gallic (Celtic) element in the &quot;alt&quot; in Authou.
The Gallic term &quot;Attegia&quot; was recognized by Xavier Delamarre in Atheist-type names - e.g. &quot;Athis&quot; in the sense of &quot;cabin or hut&quot;.

This analyses to &quot;ad-&quot; (pre-verb) and &quot;tegia&quot; meaning &quot;house&quot; (cf. Old Irish &quot;teg&quot;, old Welsh &quot;tig&quot;, Welsh &quot;Ty&quot;, Old Breton &quot;tig&quot;, and Breton &quot;ti&quot; all meaning &quot;house&quot;).

It is likely that Authie contains the same element &quot;tegia&quot; preceded by another prefix. From a phonetic point of view there is a palatalization of the intervocalic consonant where [g] becomes [j] and then an Amuïssement or attenuation of [j]&gt;[∅], a recurrent phenomenon in phonetics.
The same author explains that &quot;Arthies&quot; (&quot;Artegiae&quot; 680) may come from &quot;*Are-tegia&quot; which is a possible solution for Authie, knowing that [r] regularly becomes [l] before a consonant.

The name &quot;Altavilla&quot; is either a medieval romanization of a place named &quot;Hauteville&quot; as in Hauteville in Manche department and therefore does not relate to &quot;Authie&quot;. It may be a scribal error for &quot;*Alteia Villa&quot; or &quot;*Villa Alteia&quot; which mentions a villa, i.e. a rural area in medieval Latin, in a place called &quot;Alteia&quot; which is Authie.

==History==
In 1832 Authie (466 inhabitants in 1831) absorbed Saint-Louet-près-Authie (9 people) in the west of its territory.

The commune was liberated on 8 June 1944 but was largely destroyed in the bombing.

<text>The Sambians were a Prussian tribe. They inhabited the Sambia Peninsula north of the city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad). Sambians were located in a coastal territory rich in amber and engaged in trade early on (see Amber Road). Therefore, they established contacts with foreign nations before any other Prussians. However, as with all other Prussians, they were conquered by the Teutonic Knights, and, exposed to assimilation and Germanization, became extinct sometime in the 17th century.

The Sambians bordered the Natangians in the south, and the Nadruvians in the east.

==History==
Engaged in the amber trade, Sambia was the richest and most densely populated region of Prussia. It provides a wealth of artifacts from the Bronze Age, including imported goods from the Roman Empire. Sambians, unlike other Prussians, did not cremate their dead. They built earth barrows above graves and surrounded them with stone circles. The name of the clan was first mentioned in 1073 by Adam of Bremen, who calls them &quot;most humane people&quot;. Warfare with Danes continued from the mid-9th century to beginning of the 13th century. It is known that there was Wiskiauten, a Viking settlement in Sambia, that flourished for about 300 years. Swedes maintained more peaceful relations and fostered trade.

The 13th century saw the rise of another enemy, the Teutonic Knights, a crusading military order from the Holy Roman Empire. Its goal was to conquer all pagans and convert them to Roman Catholicism. The conquest of Sambia during the Prussian Crusade was delayed by the First Prussian Uprising that broke out in 1242. The uprising technically ended in 1249 by signing the Treaty of Christburg, but skirmishes lasted for four more years. Only in 1254–1255 could the Knights arrange a large campaign against the Sambians. King Ottokar II of Bohemia participated in the expedition and as a tribute the Knights named the newly founded Königsberg Castle in his honor. The Sambians rose against the Knights during the Great Prussian Uprising (1260–1274), but were the first ones to surrender. When other clans tried to resurrect the uprising in 1276 Theodoric, vogt of Sambia convinced the Sambians not to join the insurrection; Natangians and Warmians followed the Sambian lead and the uprising was crushed within a year. In 1243, the Bishopric of Samland (Sambia) was established as the church administration of the region, as arranged by the papal legate William of Modena. At the end of the 13th century, Sambians numbered only about 22,000. They gave in to Germanization later than western tribes that were conquered earlier. In 1454, the region was incorporated by King Casimir IV Jagiellon to the Kingdom of Poland. After the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War, the longest of all Polish–Teutonic wars, since 1466, Sambia formed part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Order, and after 1525 held by secular Ducal Prussia.

According to Peter von Dusburg, Sambia was subdivided in 15 territorial units. Their German names (from east to west) are: Germau, Medenau, Rinau, Pobeten, Wargen, Rudau, Laptau, Quedenau, Schaaken, Waldau, Caimen, Tapiau, Labiau, Laukischken, and Wehlau.

<text>Auvillars () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France.

==Geography==
Auvillars is located some 14 km north-west of Lisieux and 17 km south-east of Cabourg. Access to the commune is by the D16 road from Léaupartie in the south-west which passes through the centre of the commune and the village and continues to Bonnebosq in the north-east. The D101 passes through the east of the commune as it goes from Cambremer to Pont-l&#x27;Évêque. The D59 which connects Bonnebosq to La Boissière passes south through the commune. The commune is entirely farmland except for a few scattered forests.

The &quot;Dorette&quot; river passes through the centre of the commune from north-east to south-west and it continues south-west to join the &quot;Dives&quot; at Le Radier. The &quot;Mont Dorain&quot; rises in the north of the commune and flows south to join the &quot;Dorette&quot;. The &quot;Ruisseau Sainte-Agathe&quot; flows from the east to join the &quot;Dorette&quot; near the village.

==History==
In his &quot;Monumental Statistics of Calvados&quot; (1862), Arcisse de Caumont described the history of Auvillars as follows:

&quot;As always, Auvillars had the first lords of the members of a family whose name was that of the commune itself. This family became extinct in the person of Jeanne d&#x27;Auvillars, daughter and heiress of Guillaume, lord and chatelain of Auvillars, Saint Aubin de Salona, and Barneville who married Robert de Tournebu, Baron de la Motte-Cesny, Grimbosc, etc. at the beginning of the 14th century.

Mr Floquet told of a curious trial that argued that Robert de Tournebu, lord of Auvillars, maltreated a cleric of the priory of Beaumont-en-Auge in the year 1342. He was sentenced to a fine of 400 livres, a huge sum for that time (see History of the Parliament of Normandy). A century later Richard de Tournebu more usefully employed his vigour to support a heroic siege against the captains of the invader Henry V. His capitulation on 7 August 1417 was devised on condition that showed the Norman barons, despite the lack of organization where the invasion had landed, had not made a capable resistance that could be respected. The text of the capitulation was published in the volume entitled &quot;rotuli normanniae&quot; printed in London in 1835 on page 285 and by the Society of Antiquaries of Normandy, Volume XV, page 263 of his memoirs.

Just as the castle was to be evacuated Henry hastened to donate it to the Earl of Salisbury, his cousin, to be sure of its conservation (25 September 1417).

At the time of death of Guillemette de Tournebu in 1485 Jean de Harcourt, his great-grandson, inherited and he added to his other titles that of lord and chatelain of Auvillars. In 1558, Auvillars was in the hands of a family named Salcede: Nicolas Salcede, the owner in 1582, was at that time involved in a conspiracy formed, it is said, by the Guises against the Duke of Alençon and King Henry III, his brother. He was tried by the Parliament of Paris, convicted of the crime of treason, and as such condemned to be quartered. This execution, the memory of which is still preserved in Auvillars, must have taken place around 1588. In 1600 Mme Charlotte Duquesnel d&#x27;Aussebost was Dowager of Auvillars. After her death in 1617 the lordship passed to a family named Miou. The head of this family was one of the principal officers of the Duke of Lorraine and his daughter, Louise Marie de Miou, married Pierre Dauvet of Tréguy.

The Dauvet family were nobility from Picardy who were allied to Breze, Montmorency, Saint-Simon, Bethune, Chabannes, etc.

Several of its members took to the sword. Benoit Dauvet and Louis-Nicolas Dauvet distinguished themselves in the battles of Louis XIV and Louis XV.

There is information on this house in the &quot;History of the great officers of the Crown&quot; by P Anselm. Its door was lined with gold and silver in 6 pieces: the first charged with a black lion passant in bend. A Marquisate crown; supported by two savages (see Waroquier, Vol. VII).

Thus one sees the arms on the &quot;funeral litre&quot; in the Chapel of Saint Jean d&#x27;Auvillars.

In 1700 Sir Peter Dauvet de Tréguy gave grassland to the poor of Auvillars which was located at Druval and Rumesnil. They still enjoy. The same lords from the Dauvet family founded a school for girls and from their private income. The children of the two parishes of Auvillars and Repentigny were educated there free by a sister of Providence from the Lisieux house. The income was lost through a faulty title. The house was sold by the revolutionaries and was bought by a resident who gave it back to its original purpose.

The presbytery, which had been confiscated, was bought by the commune around 1806.

There were 3 privileged fires and 80 taxable fires at Auvillars.

The small parish of Repentigny has always been a kind of dependency to that of Auvillars. The Lords of Auvillars were patrons, as for Repentigny, and they constantly showed benevolence. The parish had first been removed and reunited with Rumesnil but at the beginning of the reign of Charles X it was reunited with Auvillars as an independent vicariate&quot;.

==Administration==

List of successive mayors
==Demography==
The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Auvillargeois&quot; or &quot;Auvillargeoises&quot; in French.

==Culture and heritage==

===Civil heritage===
The commune has a number of buildings that are registered as historical monuments:
*La Bruyère Manor (15th century)
*La Bruyère Manor Garden (1972)
*A Brickworks (1879)

===Religious heritage===
The commune has one religious building that is registered as an historical monument:
*The Church of Saint Germain (12th century)

====The Church of Saint Germain====
The church is built in a valley about 1 km from the town of Bonnebosq.

=====The choir=====
The whole choir dates back to the 12th century. It is lit on the north side by two narrow arched windows devoid of any ornament and very splayed on the inside; to the south is a similar window, enlarged a little on the outside, and a large modern semicircular window. The side walls each have two flat buttresses inside which is a newly built gallery leading to the sacristy placed behind the choir. The choir ends on the eastern side by a right chevet supported by three flat buttresses. There were originally two narrow semicircular windows that have been blocked. The gable is surmounted by an &quot;antefix&quot; cross.

=====The nave=====
The southern wall of the nave, without buttresses, shows a device of fern leaves. It is pierced by a semicircular door whose lintel is decorated with zigzags based on the columns. The arch is topped with grimacing heads of fantastic animals whose tongues are wrapped around a Torus that lines the underside of the arch (see photo). The nave is lit on this side by four very large semicircular windows, three of which are modern. The fourth is a little less wide and lined with a simple bevel and dates from first half of the 16th century when the nave was extended by one bay.

The northern wall was erected in the 16th century. It is flanked by projecting buttresses and pierced by three windows, one flamboyant and divided by a mullion, another a low arch ornamented with prismatic mouldings, and the other a modern window without character. This wall has the remains of a funeral litre.

=====The chapel=====
A chapel was built between the choir and the nave in the 16th century. The chapel is illuminated on the north side by a large semicircular window ornamented with prismatic mouldings and to the east by a flamboyant window divided into two bays which are today blocked.

=====The west portal=====
The western portal is in a renaissance style and is dated 1538. It is supported by four projecting buttresses, two of which are placed on the corners. The portal, which protrudes toward the middle, is pierced by a semi-circular door flanked by two columns and topped with two windows, now blocked, and decorated with prismatic mouldings. The curved form is pierced at the same time by an oculus and surmounted by a square tower built in timber and covered with slate. A wooden porch was previously in front of portal.

=====Inside=====
*The nave is separated from the aisle by four large arches including two of ogival form with prismatic mouldings and the other two semicircular. One of them has features similar to those of the door.
*The pulpit is in Louis XV style.
*At the end of the nave are two little altars with the altarpiece decorated with twisted columns around which are wound vines and crowned with trapezoidal pediments.
*The vault is in wood with tie beams and hallmarks.
*The Chapel of the Virgin was built around 1600 by the Dauvet d&#x27;Auvillars family.
*The roof of the vault is covered with paintings. In the triangles there are angels holding rosaries in their hands.
*A triumphal arch decorated with zigzags separates the chancel from the nave.
*One of the windows that illuminate the choir, to the north has remnants of stained glass. A head of the Virgin can still be seen adorned with a ducal crown and there are two religious figures, one of which is holding a chalice. The bottom of this window reads: De tournebu cure
*The altar is decorated in the Louis XV style. The tabernacle is decorated with angels and caryatids.
*There is a large Romanesque credenza on the side of the Epistle.
*The two church bells in Auvillars predate the French Revolution. It is not known how they came to be in this tower as they were part of the bells of Saint Germain in Lisieux. Here are the inscriptions they bear:
**The year 1738 has been named Magdalaine Françoise by François Mignot, counsellor to the king, elected president of this town and noble lady Mary Magdalaine Moucel, the wife of Sir Alexander le Maignen, knight, lord of Houlbec and Castillon.
**The year 1738 has been named Louise Nicolase by Nicolas Riquier de la Rosiere, adviser to the king in the election and by damsel Louise Gennevievre Dosmont, daughter of Sir Louis Dosmont, squire to Lord Malicorne of Mesnil-Poisson.

=====The cemetery=====
When the sanctuary was repaved in 1853, when the old tiles were removed a tombstone from the 15th or 16th century was discovered. This stone is topped by a statue of a priest holding an old chasuble, turned up at the shoulders with &quot;amict&quot; turned down. The head rests on a cushion with tassels held by angels. At the character&#x27;s feet lies a dog gnawing a bone. Several parts of this tombstone have been mutilated but the statue is well preserved and perfectly sculpted, it was once under an arched arcade on the southern wall.

There are the remains of an old halo cross in the cemetery dating from the 17th century or perhaps as late as the end of the 16th century. On one side is represented Christ and on the other the Virgin Mary holding in her arms the Child Jesus. The lattice work is decorated with palm leaves.

Near the gate stands an old yew tree which is 4.1 metres in girth.

When the foundations of the sacristy were dug a sword was found at a depth of 2.5 metres that appears to date back to ancient times.

=====History=====
The church is under the patronage of Saint Germain. The parish was divided into two portions which were united around 1708 with provision for two priests: the two priests were both nominated by the Lord. The &quot;pouillé&#x27; (Ecclesiastical register) of Lisieux shows that the Lord in the 14th century was dominus Robertus de Tournebut. There are many items in the church that are registered as historical objects:

*A tombstone of a cleric of Tournevu (14th century)

====Chapel of Saint-Jean====
The Chapel of Saint-Jean stands on a hill 2 kilometres south of the Church of Auvillars. It dates to the last Flamboyant Gothic period and is about 30 feet long by 15 wide. The western gate, flanked by two buttresses, finishes with a very sharp curve which supports a very steep roof. The ogival doorway is decorated with prismatic mouldings and surmounted by a window from the same era. In front of the chapel there are two large poplar trees at the entrance.

The nave is lit by four windows: two full-arched with chamfer and the other two segmented arch. The walls are flanked by protruding buttresses and terminate in a quarter-round cornice.

The chevet on the right is flanked by two buttresses and finishes, as with the portal, with a very sloping curve surmounted by an &quot;antefix&quot; cross. On the southern wall are the remains of a &quot;funeral litre&quot;. The heraldic emblems painted on the liter are reproduced inside the chapel. On the side of the epistle there is an ogival pool.

==Geography==
Avenay is located some 12 km south-west of Caen just east of Évrecy. Access to the commune is by the D36 road from Sainte-Honorine-du-Fay in the south-west which passes through the heart of the commune and the village and continues north to join the D8. Apart from the village there is the hamlet of &quot;La Coquerie&quot; on the eastern border. The commune consists entirely of farmland.

The &quot;Guigne&quot; river flows along the northern border of the commune towards the east where it joins the Orne south of Bully.

==History==
The oldest traces of Avenay village date from Gallo-Roman times. In 1820-1821 some remains of Gallo-Roman houses were found. In the Middle Ages, the village depended on the Bishop of Bayeux.

In 1827 Avenay (336 inhabitants in 1821) absorbed Fierville-en-Bessin (68 people) in the east of its territory.

<text>Balleroy () is a former commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Balleroy-sur-Drôme.

==Geography==
Balleroy is located some 16 km south-west of Bayeux and 21 km north-east of Saint-Lô. Access to the commune is by the D13 road from Cerisy-la-Forêt in the west which passes through the village and continues east to Lingèvres. The D28 road goes south from the village to Planquery. The commune is mainly farmland with the Château de Balleroy grounds just west of the village occupying a substantial land area.

The river Drôme forms the western and north-western borders of the commune as it flows north-east to eventually join the ocean at Port-en-Bessin-Huppain. The &quot;Ruisseau de la Commune&quot; flows from the west to join the Drome in the commune. The &quot;Vesbire&quot; forms the south-eastern border of the commune as it flows south-west to join the Drôme.

==History==
Until 1521 the commune was the property of the lord of Aunay. The lordship of Balleroy was purchased by the Trextot family. Jean de Choisy, counselor, notary and secretary of the king, in turn bought the lordship of Balleroy as well as the lands of Cormolain, Montfiquet, and Vaubadon. He was the son of Jean de Choisy, intendant of Metz, knight, advisor to the king and the Duke of Orléans, Lord of Balleroy, Beaumont, Grandcamp, Léthanville, and Saint-Pierre and he founded the present chateau. He made the inhabitants near the chateau into vassals, forcing them to build their homes there.

In 1634 the Lord of Balleroy obtained the establishment of a weekly market (on Tuesday) and two fairs a year.

During the French revolutionary period of the National Convention (1792-1795), the commune was called &quot;Bal-sur-Drôme&quot;.

===Heraldry===
==Administration==
Balleroy was part of the Community of communes Intercom Balleroy Le Molay-Littry which included 22 communes and had its seat in Le Molay-Littry.

Balleroy was the seat of the former Canton of Balleroy. Since the 2015 French cantons reform, it is part of the canton of Trévières.

===Activities and events===
Each year a gathering of hot air balloons took place at the Château de Balleroy. This gathering took place for the last time in 1999 when Malcolm Forbes, the chateau&#x27;s owner, would have celebrated his 80th birthday.

Since 2007 in the face of demand from the public, the festival was again held at the end of June but this no longer happens in the castle. This was held by the village festival committee who organized a small gathering. The festivities are now held above the village at the stadium.

<text>Banneville-la-Campagne () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France.

==Geography==
Banneville-la Campagne is located some 8 km east of the centre of Caen just south of Sannerville. Access to the commune is by the D675 from Caen which forms the northern border of the commune as it goes east to Troarn. The D227 comes from Sannerville in the north and goes south through the village then continues to join the D225 south of the commune. The D225 comes from Troarn in the east and passes south-west through the eastern part of the commune and continues south to Émiéville. The A13 autoroute (Autoroute de Normandie: Caen to Paris) passes through the heart of the commune and the village from west to east with the intersection with the A813 autoroute (Banneville-la-Campagne to Frénouville) on the south-western border of the commune. The nearest exit is Exit to the D675 just east of the commune. Apart from the village there are the hamlets of Manneville in the south-west and Le Havre in the south-east. The commune is almost entirely farmland.

The &quot;Ruisseau du Pont Bâle&quot; forms most of the eastern border of the commune as it flows north to join the &quot;Fosse du Val&quot; on the northern border of the commune. The &quot;Ruisseau de Banneville&quot; rises in the commune and flows east to join the Ruisseau du Pont Bâle as does the &quot;Cours de Guillerville&quot; in the south-east where it forms part of the southern border of the commune.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Banneville&quot; was attested as &quot;Magnevilla&quot; in 1198.

The suffix &quot;-ville&quot; means in the old sense &quot;rural domain&quot; (cf. vilain), preceded by the Old Norse personal surname Norse &quot;Barn&quot; meaning &quot;child&quot;.

The name is a homonym with all the Barnevilles in Normandy.

The complementary determinant &quot;-la-Campagne&quot; was attested from 1371 and refers to the &quot;campagne de Caen&quot; (the Caen Plain). This term belongs to the Northern Norman dialect and equivalent to the central French &quot;champagne&quot;. The Norman-Picard word &quot;campagne&quot; (Rural area) has been incorporated in standard French.

The name allows it to be distinguished from Banneville-sur-Ajon, another town in Calvados. It is uncertain that it shares the same etymology. The form &quot;Barneville sur Ajon&quot; was already mentioned in 1371.

==History==
In 1828 Banneville-la-Campagne (30 inhabitants in 1821) absorbed Guillerville (100 inhabitants in the southeast of the territory) and Manneville (47 inhabitants in the south-west).

During the Invasion of Normandy Guillerville was attacked on 19 July 1944 by the British 3rd Infantry Division as part of Operation Goodwood as part of the taking of the town of Troarn to the east. British tanks of the 27th Armoured Brigade faced the tanks of the Wehrmacht 21st Panzer Division and Tiger I tanks of the 503rd battalion of heavy tanks. Guillerville was finally liberated in the operation but not Troarn.

==Demography==
The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Bannevillais&quot; or &quot;Bannevillaises&quot; in French.

==Sites and monuments==
*A Chateau Gateway (14th century) is registered as an historical monument. It is the old gateway of the Abbey of Saint-Martin of Troarn which was removed in 1843 for the construction of the road from Troarn to Saint-Samson. It was re-erected, at the request of Gaston-Robert, Marquis de Banneville, in the commune of Banneville where it now serves as the entrance to the chateau.

<text>Grulla National Wildlife Refuge is located primarily in eastern New Mexico in Roosevelt County, southwest of the intersection of State Highway 88 and the Texas - New Mexico border about 25 miles southeast of Portales, New Mexico and southeast of the tiny community of Arch. A very small part of the refuge extends eastward into western Bailey County, Texas.

The central focal point of the Grulla National Wildlife Refuge is an ephemeral salt lake or saline playa – a shallow basin that collects runoff from the surrounding drainage area during heavy downpours but then often dries completely due to evaporation. This playa lake has been known by various names. Current USGS topographic maps and most commercially available maps of this region refer to this saline playa simply as &quot;Salt Lake&quot;. Back in the early 1880s, this playa was part of the DZ Ranch, and those familiar with the ranch often favor the name &quot;DZ Lake&quot;. The lake is also frequently called &quot;Arch Lake&quot; after the nearby community of Arch, New Mexico, located around 6 km to the northwest.

The word &quot;grulla&quot; is Spanish for crane. When wet, the playa lake provides habitat to sandhill cranes and the grasslands within the refuge provide habitat to other birds such as ring-necked pheasants, lesser prairie chickens, and scaled quails.

The refuge has no facilities other than a parking lot and trails and is administered by Muleshoe National Wildlife Refuge in Texas. It was often used in the mid 2000s as a training site for the Eastern New Mexico University cross country teams.

<text>Muleshoe National Wildlife Refuge is a wildlife refuge located about south of Muleshoe, Texas, on Texas State Highway 214. It is the oldest national wildlife refuge in Texas, having been established as the Muleshoe Migratory Waterfowl Refuge by executive order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. Roosevelt issued a proclamation in 1940 to change the name to the Muleshoe National Wildlife Refuge. In 1980, Muleshoe National Wildlife Refuge was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

The refuge is a stop for migratory waterfowl flying between Canada and Mexico. The refuge includes several intermittent salt lakes, some of which have been modified to extend their wet periods. Paul&#x27;s Lake, on the east side of Highway 214, is spring-fed, and hosts wildlife during times when the other lakes are dry. If sufficient water is present during the winter, the refuge hosts tens of thousands of sandhill cranes. The largest number of cranes ever recorded was 250,000, during February, 1981.

Other wildlife includes wood warblers, meadowlarks, raptors, burrowing owls, black-tailed prairie dogs, jackrabbits, cottontail rabbits, coyotes, black-footed ferrets, spotted chorus frogs, and badgers.

The prairie ecosystem includes plant life such as wildflowers, grasses, yucca, cacti, and mesquite. Rangeland management techniques include controlled burning and grazing.

Northeast of White Lake is a small area of white gypsum dunes, similar to those found at White Sands National Park in New Mexico, though these are much less expansive.

<doc id="486758" wikidata="Q11045986" url="?curid=486758" title="Windstar Cruises">
<text>Windstar Cruises is a cruise line that operates a fleet of small luxury cruise ships. Its six yachts carry just 148 to 310 guests and cruise to 50 nations, calling at 150 ports throughout Europe, the South Pacific, the Caribbean, and Central America. In May 2014, Windstar added to its sailing yachts by adding the &quot;Star Pride&quot; power yacht, followed by &quot;Star Breeze&quot; and &quot;Star Legend&quot; in May 2015. The additional capacity opened up new itineraries such as voyages to Iceland, the Panama Canal, and Costa Rica and allowed Windstar Cruises to sail Tahiti year round.

== History ==
Founded by ship entrepreneur Karl G. Andrén, the line was established as Windstar Sail Cruises in 1984, and its first ship, the &quot;Wind Star&quot; was launched in 1986, and was followed by the &quot;Wind Song&quot; which was launched in 1987 and &quot;Wind Spirit&quot; which was launched in 1988. Two additional ships were ordered from the French &quot;Sociéte Nouvelle des Ateliers et Chantiers du Havre&quot; shipyard: the &quot;Wind Surf&quot; and the &quot;Wind Saga&quot;. These two ships were to be larger than the originals, holding over twice the number of passengers and reaching a length of , compared to the smaller vessels of in length.

=== Purchase by Holland America Line ===
Holland America Line (HAL) purchased 50% of Windstar Sail Cruises in 1987 and purchased the balance of the company in 1988. HAL became a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation &amp; plc in 1989. The option to continue building the &quot;Wind Surf&quot; and the &quot;Wind Saga&quot; was passed up by HAL. With assistance from the French Government these two larger ships were built for Club Med as &quot;Club Med I&quot; and &quot;Club Med II&quot;, with HAL / Carnival retaining rights of first refusal for purchase. A few years later, HAL / Carnival planned to buy the &quot;Club Med I&quot; and the &quot;Club Med II&quot; with permission. However, Windstar cruises was unable to purchase the ships and rename them to &quot;Wind Surf&quot; and the &quot;Wind Saga&quot; because they had only enough money to purchase one ship. So in 1998, Windstar acquired the sail cruiser &quot;Club Med I&quot; from Club Med Cruises, and rechristened her to her original name &quot;Wind Surf&quot;.

=== Sale of Windstar to Xanterra Travel Collection ===
In March 2007, Carnival sold Windstar to Ambassadors International for $100 million.

On April 1, 2011, Windstar&#x27;s parent company Ambassadors International filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. A bankruptcy court in Delaware held a two-day auction and Anschutz Corporation won Windstar Cruises with a bid of $39 million. Subsidiary Xanterra Travel Collection is now the parent company.

=== Fleet Expansion ===
In 2013 Windstar completed the purchase of Seabourn Cruise Line&#x27;s &quot;Star Pride&quot;, &quot;Star Legend&quot;, and . &quot;Star Pride&quot; entered service on May 5, 2014 with an inaugural cruise from Barcelona, after some upgrades. In May 2015, Windstar increased its fleet from four yachts to six with &quot;Star Breeze&quot; and &quot;Star Legend&quot;. Both yachts underwent a $17 million, three-week dry dock in Genoa, Italy, before a christening ceremony in May. In 2016, &quot;Star Pride&quot; underwent a renovation to refurbish public spaces, expand the outdoor seating of the Veranda restaurant and remodeled the AmphorA restaurant.

In June 2018, &quot;Star Legend&quot; became the largest cruise ship to ever travel through Seattle&#x27;s Ballard Locks and the Lake Washington Ship Canal. In November 2018, Windstar announced that the three &quot;Star Class&quot; ships—&quot;Star Pride&quot;, &quot;Star Breeze&quot; and &quot;Star Legend&quot;—would be lengthened by . The work is part of the company&#x27;s US$250 million &#x27;Star Plus&#x27; initiative. The work took place at Fincantieri&#x27;s shipyard in Palermo, Italy.

In 2019, Windstar was named the Best Small Ship Cruise Line by AFAR readers and Condé Nast Traveler&#x27;s Readers&#x27; Choice Awards. In October 2019, Windstar Cruises announced that it would begin offering cruises to Alaska in 2021.

=== Recent History ===
In April 2024, it was announced Windstar would be adding two more ships to its fleet by 2026. The first of which being Windstar&#x27;s first ever new build, the Star Seeker which was originally order for Atlas Ocean Voyages as World Seeker and will enter service in December 2025. The second, Star Explorer is currently sailing as World Explorer and is on charter to Quark Expeditions. This ship will enter service at the end of the charter agreement in December 2026.

== Fleet ==
The ships are relatively small, with the &quot;Wind Surf&quot; having a capacity for about 300 passengers, and the others about 150. &quot;Star Pride&quot; carries up to 212 passengers in 106 suites as well as sister ships &quot;Star Legend&quot; and &quot;Star Breeze.&quot;

The ships are registered in the Bahamas. Under this flag they are some of the few cruise ships in the world where passengers are still allowed on the bridge (though not when entering or leaving port). With a shallow draft of only , the ships can enter ports that are inaccessible to larger cruise liners. In some cases, passengers need to take smaller boats into port (such as to Lipari) when the ship is at anchor.

<doc id="486760" wikidata="Q4943949" url="?curid=486760" title="Booths">
<text>E.H.Booth &amp; Co.,Limited, trading as Booths, is a chain of high-end supermarkets in Northern England. Most of its branches are in Lancashire, but there are also branches in Cheshire, Cumbria, North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. It has been described as the &quot;Waitrose of the North&quot; by sources such as &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

==History==

E. H. Booth &amp; Co. Ltd was founded in June 1847 when 19-year-old tea dealer Edwin Henry Booth opened a shop called the China House in Blackpool. In 1863, he added the sale of wines and spirits, and branches were opened in Lytham in 1879 and Blackburn in 1884. The business was incorporated as a private limited company in 1896.

Edwin&#x27;s son, John, opened cafes in the stores in 1902 and invited all staff to become shareholders in 1920. It has remained owned by the Booth family and staff ever since, comprising over 250 shareholders in 2011 and with no individual having more than 12% of the total shares. The current chairman, Edwin J. Booth, is the fifth generation.

In June 2005, the current chairman, Edwin J Booth, was awarded the Business in the Community (BITC) Prince of Wales Ambassador Award for North West England. This is given to individuals whose leadership and commitment to responsible business practice and the actions they have taken personally have created a positive impact both inside their company and on the wider society. He was also finalist for the Ernst &amp; Young Master Entrepreneur of the Year (North).

In 2006, Booths achieved second place in the list of the World&#x27;s Greatest Food Retailers. The panel of top designers, architects, analysts, journalists, suppliers and retailers was brought together by national trade publication, &quot;The Grocer&quot;, and asked to rank their favourite food retailers from anywhere in the world. They were impressed by the quality of the company&#x27;s offer, its focus on local sourcing and head for innovation. Simon Bell, retail director of foodservice firm Leathams, voted Booths&#x27; Chorley store first above Selfridges in London. He applauds its excellent customer service, knowledge of products and friendly staff.

A new head office was opened in early 2006 in Ribbleton, Preston and includes environmentally friendly features, such as using rainwater to flush the toilets. In 2011, Booths opened two new stores in MediaCityUK(Salford, Manchester) and Penrith, Cumbria. A new Booths store in Milnthorpe opened on 14 November 2012 and one in Barrowford opened on 4 December 2014. A branch opened in July 2015 in Burscough, followed by a store in St Annes in September and the Poulton-le-Fylde store was renovated.

In a feature article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2008, David Webster, the former chairman and co-founder of Britain&#x27;s Safeway chain (which had sold out to Morrisons in 2004), said that he had tried to buy out Booths several times over the years, as did several of his rivals: &quot;One thought Booths would have disappeared ages ago but it jolly well hasn&#x27;t. It is obviously doing an outstanding job for its customers&quot;.

In 2008, Booths was under pressure by Waitrose with rumours of a takeover, which was later ruled out. Booths and Waitrose then formed a buying group together.

Booths commissioned Small World Consulting to research its carbon footprint and the resulting report was published in 2012.

In 2015, Booths was named Independent Retail Chain of the Year at The Grocer Gold Awards. As of 11 October 2017, Amazon Fresh sells a range of Booths branded products for home delivery in selected areas.

In November 2017, it was reported that the supermarket had been put up for sale for between £130m and £150m, but this was later dismissed as &quot;speculation&quot; by the firm.

In the 2019 Birthday Honours, Booths&#x27; executive chairman Edwin J. Booth was appointed CBE &quot;for services to business and to charity&quot;.

In 2021, it was confirmed that the MediaCityUK branch was to close within months due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. After 10 years, it closed for trade in February 2021, bringing the total number of Booths stores to 27.

== Fair Milk ==
In May 2014, the store rebranded its own-label milk as Fair Milk, increasing its farm gate milk price to a yearly average of 34.4 pence per litre, and thus paying farmers more for their milk than any other UK supermarket. In 2015, Booths became a finalist in the Responsible Business Awards, organised by the charity Business in the Community (BITC), the UK&#x27;s longest-running and most respected corporate responsibility awards. Booths was one of only four companies shortlisted in the Samworth Brothers Rural Action Award, which recognises businesses which support rural communities.

==Café 1847==
The &quot;artisan&quot; speciality food shop and restaurant is a recent development by Booths. The first one was located at the Kendal store; its range is mainly local produce from small producers.

<text>In organic chemistry, a dicarbonyl is a molecule containing two carbonyl () groups. Although this term could refer to any organic compound containing two carbonyl groups, it is used more specifically to describe molecules in which both carbonyls are in close enough proximity that their reactivity is changed, such as 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-dicarbonyls. Their properties often differ from those of monocarbonyls, and so they are usually considered functional groups of their own. These compounds can have symmetrical or unsymmetrical substituents on each carbonyl, and may also be functionally symmetrical (dialdehydes, diketones, diesters, &quot;etc.&quot;) or unsymmetrical (keto-esters, keto-acids, &quot;etc.&quot;).

==1,2-Dicarbonyls==
===1,2-Dialdehyde===
The only 1,2-dialdehyde is glyoxal, . Like many alkyldialdehydes, glyoxal is encountered almost exclusively as its hydrate and oligomers thereof. These derivatives often behave equivalently to the aldehydes since hydration is reversible. Glyoxal condenses readily with amines. Via such reactions, it is a precursor to many heterocycles, e.g. imidazoles.

===1,2-Diketones===
The principal diketone is diacetyl, also known as 2,3-butanedione, . 1,2-Diketones are often generated by oxidation (dehydrogenation) of the diols: 
:&lt;chem&gt;RCH(OH)CH(OH)R -&gt; RC(O)C(O)R + 2 H2&lt;/chem&gt;
2,3-Butanedione, 2,3-pentanedione, and 2,3-hexanedione are found in small amounts in various foods. They are used as aroma components in alcohol-free beverages and in baked goods. Benzil, , is the corresponding diphenyl derivative.

A distinctive feature of 1,2-diketones is the long C-C bond linking the carbonyl groups. This bond distance is about 1.54 Å, compared to 1.45 Å for the corresponding bond in 1,3-butadiene. The effect is attributed to repulsion between the partial positive charges of the carbonyl carbon atoms.

1,2-Diketones condense with many bifunctional nucleophiles, such as urea and thiourea to give heterocycles. Condensation with aromatic amines gives diketimine ().

In the cases of 1,2-cyclohexanedione and 1,2-cyclopentanedione, the enol is about 1-3 kcal/mol more stable than the diketo form.

ortho-Quinone, , is the parent of a large family of 1,2-diketones.

===1,2-Ketoaldehydes===

A well-known compound of this class is methylglyoxal, , also known as pyruvaldehyde. These compounds are also known as 2-oxoaldehydes or α-ketoaldehydes.

===1,2-Diesters and diacids===
Oxalic acid and its esters define this family of compounds. The diacid is produced industrially by oxidation of waste sugars. It occurs naturally (as the conjugate base), notably in members of the plant species &quot;Oxalis&quot;. Condensation of the diesters with diamines gives cyclic diamides.

===α-Keto- and formylcarboxylic acids===
α-Keto-acids and -esters are well known. Pyruvic acid () is the parent α-ketoacid. Its conjugate base, pyruvate (), is a component of the citric acid cycle and product of glucose metabolism (glycolysis). The corresponding aldehyde-acid is glyoxalic acid ().

==1,3-Dicarbonyls==
===1,3-Dialdehydes===
The parent 1,3-dialdehyde is malondialdehyde (), a β-dicarbonyl. Like most dialdehydes, it is rarely encountered as such. Instead it is handled almost exclusively as its hydrate, methyl acetal, and oligomers thereof. These derivatives often behave like the parent. Many 2-substituted derivatives are known. They are often prepared by alkylation of the enolate of malondialdehyde.

===1,3-Diketones===
1,3-Diketones are also called β-diketones. An important member is acetylacetone, . Dimedone is a cyclic 1,3-diketone. 1,3-Indandione is the cyclic 1,3-diketone fused to a benzene ring. Acetylacetone is prepared industrially by the thermal rearrangement of isopropenylacetate. Another cyclic 1,3-diketone is 2,2,4,4-tetramethylcyclobutanedione, which is a precursor to a useful diol.
:&lt;chem&gt;CH2(CH3)COC(O)Me -&gt; MeC(O)CH2C(O)Me&lt;/chem&gt;

1,3-Diketones often tautomerize to an enol and ketol. They usually exist predominantly in the enol form . The percent enol in acetylacetone, trifluoroacetylacetone, and hexafluoroacetylacetone are 85, 97, and 100%, respectively (neat, 33 °C). Cyclic 1,3-diketones, such as 1,3-cyclohexanedione and dimedone, similarly exist significantly in the enol form.

Like other diketones, 1,3-diketones are versatile precursors to heterocycles. The conjugate base derived from 1,3-ketones can serve as ligand s to form metal acetylacetonate coordination complexes. In the DeMayo reaction 1,3-diketones react with alkenes in a photochemical pericyclic reaction to form (substituted) 1,5-diketones.

Classically, 1,3-diketones are prepared by the Claisen condensation of a ketone with an ester.

===1,3-Diesters and diacids===
Malonic acid and its esters are the parent members of this class of dicarbonyls. Also common are the 2-substituted derivatives with the formula , which arise by C-alkylation of the conjugate base (the enolate) .

===β-Keto-esters===
β-Keto-esters arise readily by the condensation of a pair of esters. A well known example is ethyl acetoacetate (although it is prepared by ethanolysis of ketene).

==1,4-Dicarbonyls==
===1,4-Dialdehydes===
Succinaldehyde (CH2CHO)2 is the simplest and parent 1,4-dialdehyde. The aromatic derivative is phthalaldehyde.

===1,4-Diketones===

Diketones with two methylene groups separating the carbonyl groups, also called γ-diketones, typically coexist with their enol tautomers. The preeminent member is acetonylacetone. 1,4-Diketones are useful precursors to heterocycles via the Paal–Knorr synthesis, which gives pyrroles: 
This reactivity is the basis of the neurotoxicity of γ-diketones. 1,4-Diketones are also precursor to furans and thiophenes. The condensation of 1,4-diketones (and related substrates) with hydrazines afford dihydropyridazines, which can be converted to pyridazines.

&quot;para&quot;-quinone, C4H4(CO)2, is the parent of a large family of 1,4-diketones.

===1,4-Diesters and diacids===
Succinic acid and its esters are the parent members of this family of 1,4-dicarbonyls. Succinic acid is notable as a component in the citric acid cycle. It forms a cyclic acid anhydride, succinic anhydride. Unsaturated members include maleic and fumaric acids and their esters.

==1,5-Dicarbonyls==
===1,5-Dialdehydes===
Glutaraldehyde (CH2)3(CHO)2 is the simplest and parent 1,5-dialdehyde. It hydrates readily. The aromatic analogue is isophthalaldehyde.

===1,5-Diketones===
These diketones have three methylene groups separating the carbonyl groups.

===1,5-Diesters and diacids===
Glutaric acid (CH2)3(CO2H)2 is the parent 1,5-diacid.

==Hydration and cyclization==
Small aldehydes tend to hydrate. Hydration is prevalent for dialdehydes. Glyoxal forms a series of cyclic hydrates. Succinaldehyde hydrates readily to give 2,5-dihydroxy­tetrahydro­furan. The aromatic phthalaldehyde also forms hydrated.

Similar hydration and cyclization equilibria apply to maleic dialdehyde, glutaraldehyde, and adipaldehyde.

==Safety==
A number of dicarbonyl compounds are bioactive. Diacetyl is known to cause the lung disease bronchiolitis obliterans in those individuals exposed to it in an occupational setting. Dialdehydes, e.g. glutaraldehyde and malonaldehyde, are fixatives or sterilizers.

<text>Bank fraud is the use of potentially illegal means to obtain money, assets, or other property owned or held by a financial institution, or to obtain money from depositors by fraudulently posing as a bank or other financial institution. In many instances, bank fraud is a criminal offence. 

While the specific elements of particular banking fraud laws vary depending on jurisdictions, the term bank fraud applies to actions that employ a scheme or artifice, as opposed to bank robbery or theft. For this reason, bank fraud is sometimes considered a white-collar crime.

== Types of bank fraud ==

=== Accounting fraud ===
In order to hide serious financial problems, some businesses have been known to use fraudulent bookkeeping to overstate sales and income, inflate the worth of the company&#x27;s assets, or state a profit when the company is operating at a loss. These tampered records are then used to seek investment in the company&#x27;s bond or security issues or to make fraudulent loan applications in a final attempt to obtain more money to delay the inevitable collapse of an unprofitable or mismanaged firm. Examples of accounting frauds include the Enron scandal, World Com and Ocala Funding. These companies &quot;cooked the books&quot; in order to appear as though they had profits each quarter, when in fact they were deeply in debt.

====Demand draft fraud====
Demand draft (DD) fraud typically involves one or more corrupt bank employees. Firstly, such employees remove a few DD leaves or DD books from stock and write them like a regular DD. Since they are insiders, they know the coding and punching of a demand draft. Such fraudulent demand drafts are usually drawn payable at a distant city without debiting an account. The draft is cashed at the payable branch. The fraud is discovered only when the bank&#x27;s head office does the branch-wide reconciliation, which normally take six months, by which time the money is gone.

====Remotely created check fraud====

Remotely created checks are orders of payment created by the payee and authorized by the customer remotely, using a telephone or the internet by providing the required information including the MICR code from a valid check. They do not bear the signatures of the customers like ordinary cheques. Instead, they bear a legend statement &quot;Authorized by Drawer&quot;. This type of instrument is usually used by credit card companies, utility companies, or telemarketers. The lack of signature makes them susceptible to fraud. The fraud is considered Demand Draft fraud in the US.

====Uninsured deposits====
A bank soliciting public deposits may be uninsured or not licensed to operate at all. The objective is usually to solicit for deposits to this uninsured &quot;bank,&quot; although some may also sell stock representing ownership of the &quot;bank.&quot; Sometimes the names appear very official or very similar to those of legitimate banks. For instance, the unlicensed &quot;Chase Trust Bank&quot; of Washington D.C. appeared in 2002, bearing no affiliation to its seemingly apparent namesake; the real Chase Manhattan Bank is based in New York.
Accounting fraud has also been used to conceal other theft taking place within a company.

=== Bill discounting fraud ===
Essentially a confidence trick, a fraudster uses a company at their disposal to gain the bank&#x27;s confidence, by posing as a genuine, profitable customer. To give the illusion of being a desired customer, the company regularly and repeatedly uses the bank to get payment from one or more of its customers. These payments are always made, as the customers in question are part of the fraud, actively paying any and all bills the bank attempts to collect. After the fraudster has gained the bank&#x27;s trust, the company requests that the bank begin paying the company up front for bills it will collect from the customers later. Many banks will agree but are not likely to go whole hog right away. So again, business continues as normal for the fraudulent company, its fraudulent customers, and the unwitting bank. As the bank grows more comfortable with the arrangement, it will trust the company more and more and be willing to give it larger and larger sums of money up front. Eventually, when the outstanding balance between the bank and the company is sufficiently large, the company and its customers disappear, taking the money the bank paid up front and leaving no one to pay the bills issued by the bank.

==== Duplication or skimming of card information ====
This takes a number of forms, ranging from merchants copying clients&#x27; credit card numbers for use in later illegal activities or criminals using carbon copies from old mechanical card imprint machines to steal the info, to the use of tampered credit or debit card readers to copy the magnetic stripe from a payment card while a hidden camera captures the numbers on the face of the card.

Some fraudsters have attached fraudulent card stripe readers to publicly accessible ATMs to gain unauthorised access to the contents of the magnetic stripe as well as hidden cameras to illegally record users&#x27; authorisation codes. The data recorded by the cameras and fraudulent card stripe readers are subsequently used to produce duplicate cards that could then be used to make ATM withdrawals from the victims&#x27; accounts.

=== Cheque kiting ===
Cheque kiting exploits a banking system known as &quot;the float&quot; wherein money is temporarily counted twice. When a cheque is deposited to an account at Bank X, the money is made available immediately in that account even though the corresponding amount of money is not immediately removed from the account at Bank Y at which the cheque is drawn. Thus both banks temporarily count the cheque amount as an asset until the cheque formally clears at Bank Y. The float serves a legitimate purpose in banking, but intentionally exploiting the float when funds at Bank Y are insufficient to cover the amount withdrawn from Bank X is a form of fraud.

=== Forged or fraudulent documents ===
Forged documents are often used to conceal other thefts; banks tend to count their money meticulously so every penny must be accounted for. A document claiming that a sum of money has been borrowed as a loan, withdrawn by an individual depositor or transferred or invested can therefore be valuable to someone who wishes to conceal the fact that the bank&#x27;s money has in fact been stolen and is now gone.

=== Forgery and altered cheques ===

Fraudsters have altered cheques to change the name (in order to deposit cheques intended for payment to someone else) or the amount on the face of cheques, simple altering can change $100.00 into $100,000.00. (However, transactions for such large values are routinely investigated as a matter of policy to prevent fraud.)

Instead of tampering with a real cheque, fraudsters may alternatively attempt to forge a depositor&#x27;s signature on a blank cheque or even print their own cheques drawn on accounts owned by others, non-existent accounts, etc. They would subsequently cash the fraudulent cheque through another bank and withdraw the money before the banks realise that the cheque was a fraud.

=== Fraudulent loan applications ===
These take a number of forms varying from individuals using false information to hide a credit history filled with financial problems and unpaid loans to corporations using accounting fraud to overstate profits in order to make a risky loan appear to be a sound investment for the bank.

=== Fraudulent loans ===
One way to remove money from a bank is to take out a loan, which bankers are more than willing to encourage if they have good reason to believe that the money will be repaid in full with interest. A fraudulent loan, however, is one in which the borrower is a business entity controlled by a dishonest bank officer or an accomplice; the &quot;borrower&quot; then declares bankruptcy or vanishes and the money is gone. The borrower may even be a non-existent entity and the loan is merely an artifice to conceal a theft of a large sum of money from the bank. This can also be seen as a component within mortgage fraud (Bell, 2010).

=== Empty ATM envelope deposits ===
A criminal overdraft can result due to the account holder making a worthless or misrepresented deposit at an automated teller machine in order to obtain more cash than present in the account or to prevent a check from being returned due to non-sufficient funds. United States banking law makes the first $100 immediately available and it may be possible for much more uncollected funds to be lost by the bank the following business day before this type of fraud is discovered. The crime could also be perpetrated against another person&#x27;s account in an &quot;account takeover&quot; or with a counterfeit ATM card, or an account opened in another person&#x27;s name as part of an identity theft scam. The emergence of ATM deposit technology that scans currency and checks without using an envelope may prevent this type of fraud in the future.

=== Identity theft or Impersonation ===

Identity theft operates by obtaining information about an individual, then using the information to apply for identity cards, accounts and credit in that person&#x27;s name. Often little more than name, parents&#x27; name, date and place of birth are sufficient to obtain a birth certificate; each document obtained then is used as identification in order to obtain more identity documents. Government-issued standard identification numbers such as &quot;social security numbers&quot; are also valuable to the fraudster.

=== Money laundering ===

The term &quot;money laundering&quot; dates back to the days of Al Capone; money laundering has since been used to describe any scheme by which the true origin of funds is hidden or concealed.

Money laundering is the process by which large amounts of illegally obtained money (from drug trafficking, terrorist activity or other serious crimes) is given the appearance of having originated from a legitimate source.

=== Payment card fraud ===

Credit card fraud is widespread as a means of stealing from banks, merchants and clients.

=== Phishing or Internet fraud ===

Phishing, also known as Internet fraud, operates by sending forged e-mail, impersonating an online bank, auction or payment site; the e-mail directs the user to a forged web site which is designed to look like the login to the legitimate site but which claims that the user must update personal info. The information thus stolen is then used in other frauds, such as theft of identity or online auction fraud.

A number of malicious &quot;Trojan horse&quot; programmes have also been used to snoop on Internet users while online, capturing keystrokes or confidential data in order to send it to outside sites.

Fake websites can trick a visitor into downloading computer viruses that steal personal information. A visitor encounter security messages claiming his machine has viruses and instructing him to download new software, which is actually a virus.

=== Prime bank fraud ===
The &quot;prime bank&quot; operation which claims to offer an urgent, exclusive opportunity to cash in on the best-kept secret in the banking industry, guaranteed deposits in &quot;primebanks&quot;, &quot;constitutional banks&quot;, &quot;bank notes and bank-issued debentures from top 500 world banks&quot;, &quot;bank guarantees and standby letters of credit&quot; which generate spectacular returns at no risk and are &quot;endorsed by the World Bank&quot; or various national governments and central bankers. However, these official-sounding phrases and more are the hallmark of the so-called &quot;prime bank&quot; fraud; they may sound great on paper, but the guaranteed offshore investment with the vague claims of an easy 100% monthly return are all fictitious financial instruments intended to defraud individuals.

=== Rogue traders ===
A rogue trader is a trader at a financial institution who engages in unauthorized trading; at times to recoup the loss they incurred in earlier trades. In those instances, out of fear and desperation, they manipulate the internal controls to circumvent detection to buy more time.

Unauthorized trading activities invariably produce more losses due to time constraints; most rogue traders are discovered at an early stage with losses ranging from $1 million to $100 million, but a very few working out of institutions with extremely lax controls were not discovered until the loss had reached well over a billion dollars. Rogue traders may not have criminal intent to defraud their employer to enrich themselves; they may be merely trying to recoup the loss to make their firm whole and salvage their employment.

Some of the largest unauthorized trading losses were discovered at Barings Bank (Nick Leeson), Daiwa Bank (Toshihide Iguchi), Sumitomo Corporation (Yasuo Hamanaka), Allfirst Bank (John Rusnak), Société Générale (Jérôme Kerviel), UBS (Kweku Adoboli), and JPMorgan Chase (Bruno Iksil).

=== Wire transfer fraud ===
Wire transfer networks such as the international SWIFT interbank fund transfer system are tempting as targets as a transfer, once made, is difficult or impossible to reverse. As these networks are used by banks to settle accounts with each other, rapid or overnight wire transfer of large amounts of money are commonplace; while banks have put checks and balances in place, there is the risk that insiders may attempt to use fraudulent or forged documents which claim to request a bank depositor&#x27;s money be wired to another bank, often an offshore account in some distant foreign country.

There is a very high risk of fraud when dealing with unknown or uninsured institutions.

The risk is greatest when dealing with offshore or Internet banks (as this allows selection of countries with lax banking regulations), but not by any means limited to these institutions. There is an annual list of unlicensed banks on the US Treasury Department web site which is fifteen pages in length.

Also, a person may send a wire transfer from country to country. Since this takes a few days for the transfer to &quot;clear&quot; and be available to withdraw, the other person may still be able to withdraw the money from the other bank. A new teller or corrupt officer may approve the withdrawal since it is in pending status which then the other person cancels the wire transfer and the bank institution takes a monetary loss.

==Banking fraud by country==

=== Australia ===
The Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework outlines the preventions, detection, investigation and reporting obligations set by the Australian Government for fraud control. The framework includes three documents called The Fraud Rule, Fraud Policy and Fraud Guidance 

The Fraud Rule is a legislative instrument binding all Commonwealth entities setting out the key requirements of fraud control.

The Fraud Policy is a government policy binding non-corporate Commonwealth entities setting out the procedural requirements for specific areas of fraud control such as investigations and reporting.

The Fraud Guidance preventing, detecting and dealing with fraud, supports best practice guidance for the Fraud Rule and Fraud Policy setting out the government&#x27;s expectations for fraud control arrangements within all Commonwealth entities.

Other important acts and regulations in the Australian Government&#x27;s fraud control framework include the:
* &quot;CrimesAct 1914&quot;, which sets out criminal offences against the Commonwealth, such as fraud
* &quot;Criminal Code 1995&quot;, which sets out criminal offences against the Commonwealth, such as fraudulent conduct
* &quot;Public Service Act 1999&quot; and the &quot;Public Service Regulations 1999&quot;, which provide for the establishment and management of the Australian Public Service and its employees
* &quot;Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&quot; and the &quot;Proceeds of Crime Regulations 2002&quot;, which provide for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.

===United States===
Under federal law, bank fraud in the United States is defined, and made illegal, primarily by the bank fraud statute in Title 18 of the U.S. Code. 18 U.S.C. § 1344 states:
:&quot;Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice—&quot;
:&quot;(1) to defraud a financial institution; or&quot;
:&quot;(2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises;&quot;
:&quot;shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.&quot;
State law may also criminalize the same, or similar acts.

The bank fraud statute was enacted by Congress in response to the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Williams v. United States&quot;, , in which the Court held that check-kiting schemes did not constitute making false statements to financial institutions (18 U.S.C. § 1014). Section 1344 has subsequently been bolstered by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Pub. L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 500.

The bank fraud statute federally criminalizes check-kiting, check forging, non-disclosure on loan applications, diversion of funds, unauthorized use of automated teller machines (ATMs), credit card fraud, and other similar offenses. Section 1344 does not cover certain forms of money laundering, bribery, and passing bad checks. Other provisions cover these offenses.

The Supreme Court has embraced a broad interpretation of both of the numbered clauses within section 1344. The Supreme Court has held that the first clause only requires the prosecution to show that the crime involved accounts controlled by a bank; the prosecution need not show actual financial loss to the bank or intent to cause such loss. The Supreme Court has also held that the second clause does not require a showing of intent to defraud a financial institution.

In the United States, consumer liability for unauthorized electronic money transfers on debit cards is covered by Regulation E of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The extent of consumer liability, as detailed in section 205.6, is determined by the speed with which the consumer notifies the bank. If the bank is notified within 2 business days, the consumer is liable for $50. Over two business days the consumer is liable for $500, and over 60 business days, the consumer liability is unlimited. In contrast, all major credit card companies have a zero liability policy, effectively eliminating consumer liability in the case of fraud.

<text>Balakovo () is a city in Saratov Oblast, Russia, located on the East bank of the Volga River about northeast of Saratov, the administrative center of the oblast. Population: 

==History==
It was founded in 1762 by the Old Believers who returned from Poland and was granted town status in 1911.

===Russian Empire===

For a long time it was believed that the city of Balakovo was founded in 1762, but later a document dated 1738 was found in the archives of St. Petersburg, which mentions the Cossack meadow possession of Balakov Yurt, located two versts from the Volga. December 14, 1762 Empress of Russia Catherine II issued a manifesto calling on the Old Believers, who had fled to Poland, to return from abroad to Russia and settle on the lands between the Bolshoy and Maly Irgiz rivers. To the zealots of the old faith, 70,000 dessiatins (76,300 hectares) of the best land on the left bank of the Volga were allocated for use. Returned Old Believers founded several new settlements, including the village of Balakovo. In 1861 there were 2,700 people living in the village of Balakovo. The convenient location on the shipping routes helped the village to grow rapidly due to wheat trade. In one season, up to 10 million poods of grain were sent from Balakovo. More than 300 spacious barns that stood on the shore of Balakovo, allowed to store grain from harvest to harvest. In the 1860s for one navigation, from Balakovo could go up to 180 barges with cargo. Another commodity, to which the Balakovo merchants traded in huge quantities, was the forest. Balakovo was an intermediary between the forest provinces of the Upper Volga region and the forestless left bank of the Volga. Here, from such rivers as Kama, Belaya, Vyatka, it was brought annually up to 500 thousand poods of firewood and up to three million poods of forest building materials. Part of this forest was processed in two sawmills.

With the development of trade, the pier freight turnover grew, the fleet of freight and passenger ships increased. To repair them, the ship-repair industry was created. In 1897 the population of the village reached 18388 people.

The beginning of the 20th century was marked by a significant expansion of the borders of the village, as well as an increase in the number of industrial enterprises. In May 1911, the Highest Ordinance was signed to confer on Balakovo the status of a city with the rights of self-government. Ivan Mamin, the industrialist, became the first city head. On the eve of the 1917 revolution, there were 6 churches, 7 schools, the grain market, the ironworks of Fyodor Blinov and the mechanical plant of oil engines of the Mamin brothers, ship repair and furniture workshops, sawmills, mills, a commercial college opened in 1910, with considerable financial assistance of the merchant - a patron of Ivan Kobzar, the Zemsky hospital and the city factory ambulance (polyclinic), a library, and a power plant, which was organized by the &quot;Light&quot; partnership.

Inventors-self-taught Fyodor Abramovich Blinov and Yakov Mamin glorified Balakovo as the birthplace of the world&#x27;s first caterpillar tractor, wheel self-propelled gun and Russian diesel engine. The plant of oil engines and tractors Yakov Mamin in 1915 produced 325 diesel engines, with a total capacity of 5100 horsepower. The image of the old Balakovo was created by such architects as H. F. Meyer and academician Fyodor Schechtel. Carefully preserving and restoring the historical landscape of the central part, the people of Balakovo constantly improve the appearance of a new, young city with spacious avenues, straight as arrows, avenues, slender buildings with elegant facades.

Until 1928, Balakovo was part of the Samara Governorate (Balakovo county existed in 1919–1924), after the Lower Volga region, from December 5, 1936, to the Saratov Oblast.

In the period from 1956 to 1971, the Saratov Hydroelectric Station was built in Balakovo, which led to the flooding of the Volga and the flooding of part of the coastal territory and the changing appearance of the modern city, as well as its sharp growth associated with obtaining the necessary electricity. In a short time the Balakovo industrial complex was created, numbering more than two dozen enterprises of chemistry, engineering, energy, construction industry, food industry. In 1985, the first power unit of the Balakovo Nuclear Power Plant was put into operation, which currently has 4 operating power units.

The ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code is encoded in half- and full-height bars. Most often, the delivery point is added, usually being the last two digits of the address or PO box number.

The barcode starts and ends with a full bar (often called a guard rail or frame bar and represented as the letter &quot;S&quot; in one version of the USPS TrueType Font) and has a check digit after the ZIP, ZIP+4, or delivery point. The encoding table is shown on the right.

Each individual digit is represented by a set of five bars, two of which are full bars (i.e. two-out-of-five code). The full bars represent &quot;on&quot; bits in a pseudo-binary code in which the places represent, from left to right: 7, 4, 2, 1, and 0. (Though in this scheme, zero is encoded as 11 in decimal, or in POSTNET &quot;binary&quot; as 11000.)

==Encoding==

The following table shows the encoding for decimal digits:


===Example===
The ZIP+4 of 55555-1237 yields a check digit of 2 for encoded data of 5555512372&lt;br&gt;
Together with the initials and terminal frame bars, this would be represented as:


==Barcode formats==

There have been four formats of Postnet barcodes used by the Postal Service:

A 5 digit (plus check digit) barcode, containing the basic ZIP Code only, referred to as the &quot;A&quot; code. 32 bars total.

A 6 digit (plus check digit) barcode, containing the last 2 digits of the ZIP Code and the 4 digits of the ZIP+4 Code, referred to as a &quot;B&quot; code. 37 bars total. In the early stages of Postal automated mail processing the B code was used to &quot;upgrade&quot; mail that had been coded only with a 5-digit &quot;A&quot; code. This barcode was only found on mail that received a 5-digit barcode on the initial coding by an OCR. Now obsolete.

A 9 digit (plus check digit) barcode, containing the ZIP Code and ZIP+4 Code, referred to as the &quot;C&quot; code. 52 bars total. The 9-digit barcode enabled the sorting of mail to the individual delivery carrier, and in some cases into a semblance of delivery sequence.

An 11 digit (plus check digit) barcode, containing the ZIP Code, ZIP+4 Code, and the delivery point code. 62 bars total. This is usually referred to as the DPBC, or Delivery Point Bar Code. By including delivery point information, it enables the Postal Service to sort mail into delivery point (address) sequence. 

==Discontinuation==

The POSTNET 11-digit barcode was the predominant postal addressing barcode in use until the Intelligent Mail barcode (also known in its early usage as OneCode Solution) was introduced and implemented. The POSTNET barcode was replaced by the Intelligent Mail barcode in the fall of 2009, combining all previous Postal Service barcodes and marking into a single barcode. The Intelligent Mail barcode was originally supposed to be required beginning May 2011 however the USPS postponed the requirement date, allowing mailers to continue receiving automation discount rates using the POSTNET barcode until January 28, 2013, at which time Intelligent Mail barcode was required for those reduced rates.

==Checkdigit algorithm==
The check digit is chosen so that the sum of all digits in the bar code is a multiple of 10. Equivalently, the modulo-10 sum is 0.

To calculate the check digit:
#Add up the digits. For example, if a letter is sent to Young America, Minnesota, it might be sent to 55555-1237, which would have the sum of 38.
#Find the remainder of this number when it is divided by 10, in this case 8. This is also known as the sum modulo 10. A simple way to combine the two steps is to sum the digits without a tens column at all, but discard all carries.
#Subtract the sum modulo 10 from 10. Continuing with the example, 10 − 8 = 2. The check digit is therefore 2.

If calculated correctly, the sum of the ZIP, ZIP+4, or ZIP+4+delivery point digits and the check digit will always be a multiple of 10. Continuing with the example above, (5+5+5+5+5+1+2+3+7+2) = 40, and 40 mod 10 = 0.

Note that the Delivery Point is often added after the ZIP+4 and before the check digit, in which case the computation of the check digit includes the ZIP+4 &quot;and&quot; the Delivery Point.

<text>Tseung Kwan O New Town, commonly known as Tseung Kwan O, is one of the nine new towns in Hong Kong, built mainly on reclaimed land in the northern half of Junk Bay in southeastern New Territories, after which it is named.

Development of the new town was approved in 1982, with the initial population intake occurring in 1988. As of 2016, the town is home to around 396,000 residents. The total development area of Tseung Kwan O, including its industrial estate, is about , with a planned population of 445,000. Major residential neighbourhoods within the new town include Tsui Lam, Po Lam, Hang Hau, Tseung Kwan O Town Centre, Tiu Keng Leng (also known by its English name Rennie&#x27;s Mill) and Siu Chik Sha, etc.

Administratively, the new town belongs to Sai Kung District in southeastern New Territories, although it is often incorrectly regarded as part of Kowloon / New Kowloon due to its close proximity to the city — the new town is bordered by Kwun Tong District, a high rise built-up area, to Tseung Kwan O&#x27;s west.
==History and urban development==
The land where Tseung Kwan O New Town now stands was, until the 1980s, a long narrow inlet named Junk Bay, with small fishing villages (such as Tseung Kwan O Village and Hang Hau Village, etc.) and a few small shipbuilding establishments dotting its coastline. The present-day neighbourhood of Tiu Keng Leng (then known as Rennie&#x27;s Mill) was, from the 1950s to 1990s, a refugee village housing Kuomintang loyalists who fled to Hong Kong after their party&#x27;s defeat in the Chinese Civil War.

The Hong Kong Government had long been interested in developing a new town at Hang Hau because of its proximity to the urban area. The project was postponed for a long time owing to the extensive scale of reclamation in the bay, which is rather deep. The project finally took off under the name of Tseung Kwan O in 1983, when the development of the new town&#x27;s Phase I was endorsed by the Governor-in-Council. This was followed by the decision to proceed with Phase II, which entailed further reclamation and the clearance of the Kuomintang refugee village at Rennie&#x27;s Mill (later renamed Tiu Keng Leng), with a view to increase the planned population from 175,000 to 325,000. The first families moved in to the new town in 1988 when public housing at the Head of the Bay (Po Lam Estate) was completed.

The New Town was developed in three phases. The first phase encompasses Northern Tseung Kwan O, which includes Po Lam MTR station and Hang Hau station, while the second and third phase comprise Southern Tseung Kwan O, which includes Tseung Kwan O station (Town Centre) and Tiu Keng Leng station.
* Phase I – Hang Hau, Po Lam, Siu Chik Sha, Tsui Lam
* Phase II – Town Centre North, Tiu Keng Leng
* Phase III – Town Centre South, Pak Shing Kok, Tai Chik Sha

The design of the new town was highly transit-oriented. Developments centred along the MTR-corridor, with more than 80% of the population living within five minutes of an MTR station, with huge residential complexes surrounding the MTR stations. As most of the residential complexes surrounds the MTR station, urban open space are usually planned at the periphery of each neighbourhood in Tseung Kwan O. Neighbourhoods are therefore separated by parks.

==Geography==

Tseung Kwan O is located near the southeastern tip of the New Territories mainland, east-southeast from the Central District of Hong Kong.

The town is bounded on the south by the namesake Junk Bay, known as Tseung Kwan O () in Chinese. Most of the residential developments in the new town stand on land reclaimed from the bay. The mountains of Devil&#x27;s Peak, Chiu Keng Wan Shan, Black Hill and Tai Sheung Tok form the new town&#x27;s western boundary, where it borders Kwun Tong District of Kowloon. Lying to the north and southeast of the town are Razor Hill and High Junk Peak, which separate the new town from the rural parts of Sai Kung District.

The whole of Tseung Kwan O belongs to Sai Kung District, part of the New Territories. The town is, however, situated far away from other major population centres of the New Territories, and is instead in close proximity with Kwun Tong in Kowloon. While the town is entirely within the New Territories East geographical constituency, a number of governmental bodies and large corporations would, for the sake of administrative convenience, classify Tseung Kwan O as part of Kowloon East, adding to the confusion of the town&#x27;s residents. For example, the Hospital Authority places Tseung Kwan O under its Kowloon East Cluster. 

From 1992 to 2017, Tseung Kwan O had been policed under the Tseung Kwan O Division of the Kwun Tong Police District, and the upgraded Tseung Kwan O Police District still belongs to the Kowloon East Police Region. It is under such a situation that the new town is often incorrectly, or intentionally, referred to as part of Kowloon. This is illustrated by the fact that the two hotels in Tseung Kwan O are named Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Kowloon East and Holiday Inn Express Hong Kong Kowloon East.

===Neighbourhoods===
The development of Tseung Kwan O New Town commenced from the head of the original inlet, on reclaimed land in front of the original indigenous villages of Tseung Kwan O and Yau Yue Wan. The Po Lam neighbourhood is where the earliest developments in the new town could be found. Notably, Po Lam Estate (1988) was the first residential development in the area. Metro City Plaza, with its three phases surrounding the MTR terminus, remains the largest shopping mall in the new town.

To the southeast of Po Lam lies the residential neighbourhood of Hang Hau. It was once a small market town that served the whole of Clear Water Bay Peninsula, and was also a hub for ship breaking industries. When the new town was developed, residents of Hang Hau Town were resited into the Hang Hau Town Resite Area at the neighbourhood&#x27;s northern edge, known presently as Hang Hau Village. The reclaimed part of Hang Hau is now home to a number of residential developments as well as community facilities such as the District Hospital and Sai Kung District Council facilities.

Tseung Kwan O Town Centre refers to the area to the south of Po Lam, southwest of Hang Hau and east of Tiu Keng Leng. Centered on MTR Tseung Kwan O station, this is the major growth area in the new town where new residential developments are being built. The development of the town centre commenced with the construction of Sheung Tak Estate in 1998. It has since been extended southwards to the shoreline of Junk Bay. Early private residential developments in the area include Sun Hung Kai Properties&#x27; Park Central (2002) and The Wings (2012), and Nan Fung Group&#x27;s Tseung Kwan O Plaza (2004).

Tiu Keng Leng (formerly Rennie&#x27;s Mill) was once a cottage area housing refugees who settled in Hong Kong after the Kuomintang&#x27;s defeat in the Chinese Civil War. The refugee village was cleared before the handover. It has since been redeveloped into a mid-size high-rise residential neighbourhood.

==Demographics==
The 2016 Population By-census records the population of Tseung Kwan O New Town at 398,479, a 7.12% increase from 2011. This is equivalent to 86% of Sai Kung District&#x27;s total population.

Among the residents of Tseung Kwan O, 42% live in private housing, 34% in some form of subsidized home ownership housing (e.g. HOS courts) and 23% in public rental housing. Each of 4 more well-developed neighbourhoods in the new town, namely Po Lam, Hang Hau, Tseung Kwan O Town Centre and Tiu Keng Leng, is a combination of the above 3 types of housing clustering around a metro station. Private housing estates usually come in the form of podium-tower structures, where the podium levels are shopping malls. Most public housing estates in Tseung Kwan O are equipped with their own shopping malls as well, although mostly smaller in size than their private counterparts.

The LOHAS Park residential project in the southern part of the new town will become the largest single residential enclave in Hong Kong, with 50 high-rises skyscrapers from 46 to 76 floors high after its full completion in 2025.

A handful of pre-existing indigenous villages are also retained in the new town design.

==Economy==
Tseung Kwan O displays the characteristics of a commuter town as only less than 10% of the workforce living there works within the same district, according to the 2016 Population By-census.

===Industries===

Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate is located in the southeastern part of the town. Apart from various manufacturing industries that could not be housed in conventional multi-storey industrial buildings, the estate is also where a number of mass media outlets locate their headquarters at, including TVB City, the headquarters of Hong Kong&#x27;s largest television broadcaster, and news agencies like &quot;Apple Daily&quot; (forcibly closed on 24 June 2021) and &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot;. The industrial estate hosts a high concentration of data centres due to the fact that three out of the eight submarine communications cables connecting to Hong Kong make their landfall at the marine frontage of the estate.

Bus routes 797M (NWFB) and 298E (KMB) connect the industrial estate to southern Tseung Kwan O. A spur line of the MTR&#x27;s Tseung Kwan O line to the LOHAS Park station was completed in July 2009 and provides easy access to the industrial estate from Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.

===Shopping complexes===

Tseung Kwan O has several major shopping complexes, all sitting atop of or in close proximity to MTR stations. The largest shopping centre in the new town now is Metro City Plaza, which boasts three phases surrounding Po Lam MTR station.

Hang Hau MTR station is surrounded by an extensive network of mid-sized shopping arcades linked by footbridges. The mainstay of this multifarious complex is East Point City.

Tseung Kwan O Town Centre (Tseung Kwan O MTR station) is home to Park Central, PopCorn, and Tseung Kwan O Plaza.

An iconic 480,000-square-foot MTR shopping mall The LOHAS has been built atop LOHAS Park station. It has the largest indoor ice rink in Hong Kong as well as the largest cinema in Tseung Kwan O.

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===
====Rail====

Tseung Kwan O is linked to urban Hong Kong Island by the namesake Tseung Kwan O line of the MTR metro system. The commutes from Po Lam and Tiu Keng Leng to Central District take 31 and 24 minutes, respectively. Currently the line calls at five stations in the new town: Tiu Keng Leng, Tseung Kwan O, Hang Hau, Po Lam, and LOHAS Park. Tiu Keng Leng station is also the terminus of MTR&#x27;s Kwun Tong line which connects the town with Kowloon East. All MTR stations within the new town are either connected to or in the proximity of shopping centres and large private housing developments.

====Bus services====

The new town is also well-covered by the local public bus and minibus network. As of November 2019, a total of 50 bus routes ply between Tseung Kwan O and other districts of Hong Kong. Another 3 operate entirely within the new town. These are complemented by 37 green minibus routes. On the other hand, red minibuses are banned from entering Tseung Kwan O.

Hong Kong&#x27;s three major bus operators all have routes serving Tseung Kwan O. Kowloon Motor Bus, the major bus operator in the New Territories, serves mainly Po Lam and Hang Hau areas. Having successfully tendered for a package of bus routes serving southern Tseung Kwan O, New World First Bus now operates an extensive network serving Tiu Keng Leng, Tseung Kwan O Town Centre and most of the town&#x27;s southern part. The new town is linked to the airport at Chek Lap Kok by a handful of Citybus routes.

Bus termini could be found at Metro City Plaza in Po Lam; Tsui Lam Estate and Hong Sing Garden in Tsui Lam; Hang Hau station and Hang Hau (North) in Hang Hau; Tseung Kwan O station and Sheung Tak Estate in Tseung Kwan O Town Centre; Tiu Keng Leng station and Kin Ming Estate in Tiu Keng Leng; as well as at Oscar by the Sea, LOHAS Park and the Industrial Estate in the town&#x27;s southeastern part.

====Road network====

The new town is connected to urban Kowloon through two road tunnels. The Tseung Kwan O Tunnel acts as the major road link between Tseung Kwan O and Kwun Tong. Built to alleviate the heavy pressure on Tseung Kwan O Tunnel, the Tseung Kwan O – Lam Tin Tunnel opened to traffic in 2022 and offers a more direct linkage to the Eastern Harbour Crossing.

Other main roads leading to Tseung Kwan O include:
* Po Lam Road, connected to Kwun Tong.
* Hang Hau Road and Ying Yip Road, connected to Sai Kung and Clear Water Bay.
* Wan Po Road, connected to Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate.

The Tseung Kwan O Cross Bay Bridge spans Junk Bay and is Hong Kong&#x27;s first marine viaduct that boasts carriageways, a cycle track and a footway.

===Healthcare===

Tseung Kwan O Hospital in Hang Hau North is the only secondary care hospital within the new town boasting a 24-hour emergency department.

Situated on the western slopes of Tseung Kwan O is Haven of Hope Hospital, where subacute medical care, comprehensive rehabilitation and long-term care is provided.

The two hospitals are supplemented by public healthcare facilities like the Tseung Kwan O Jockey Club General Out-patient Clinic and Po Ning Road Health Centre, as well as the numerous private physician practices scattered among the various residential areas in the new town.

===Waste management===

East of the Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate is the 10-hectare South East New Territories Landfill (SENT), one of the three remaining landfills in Hong Kong.

==Culture and recreation==
Tseung Kwan O&#x27;s largest cultural and recreational complex is situated by the road interchange at the end of Tseung Kwan O Tunnel Road. It comprises a swimming Pool, an indoor games hall and a public library. Additional sports centres are available in Po Lam Estate, Hang Hau and Tiu Keng Leng, albeit smaller in size. Tseung Kwan O still lacks a performing arts centre, however.

Located between Tseung Kwan O Town Centre and Hang Hau, Tseung Kwan O Sports Ground was built for the 2009 East Asian Games. It was completed in early 2009 and started to host top-division football matches afterwards. The adjacent Hong Kong Velodrome has also hosted world-class cycling events like the 2017 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, since its completion in 2013.

Tseung Kwan O Football Training Centre is being developed to deliver six state of the art pitches; three artificial and three natural. It is being funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, spearheaded by Hong Kong Football Association, and constructed by Projexasia.

There are two public libraries in Tseung Kwan O. The amphitheatre-shaped Tseung Kwan O Public Library, which opened in 2001, is part of the new town&#x27;s largest recreational complex mentioned above. It was the only library in the new town until 2015, when the Tiu Keng Leng Public Library was established. Both libraries belong to the Hong Kong Public Libraries system managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department.

==Education==

Tseung Kwan O has an array of 24 primary schools and 24 secondary schools teaching the local curriculum, scattering across its major residential areas. There are also more than 40 kindergartens in the new town. In 2018, the French International School of Hong Kong (香港法國國際學校) and Shrewsbury International School Hong Kong (思貝禮國際學校) opened their campuses in the new town, in Areas 67 and 85 of Tseung Kwan O respectively.

Tseung Kwan O is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 95. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and one government school: Tseung Kwan O Government Primary School (將軍澳官立小學).

Tiu Keng Leng is home to the Hong Kong Design Institute and Lee Wai Lee Campus of the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (IVE), two vocational education establishments operated by the Vocational Training Council. Caritas Institute of Higher Education is also located in the same neighbourhood. Although not located within the new town&#x27;s boundaries, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology is only a 10-minute ride from Hang Hau in the new town.

The Fire and Ambulance Services Academy, where all new recruits of the Hong Kong Fire Services Department are trained, is located in Pak Shing Kok of Tseung Kwan O South.

==Politics==
The town is located within Sai Kung District and covered by a number of constituencies of the District Council. However, except several functions that are provided by the Home Affairs Department, the executive branch of the Hong Kong Government and its departments are not subdivided along the same borders as the districts and often have their own subdivisions. For example, the public hospitals of the town belong to the Kowloon East Cluster of the Hospital Authority.

<text>Suzdal (, ) is a town that serves as the administrative center of Suzdalsky District in Vladimir Oblast, Russia, which is located along the Kamenka tributary of the Nerl River, north of the city of Vladimir. As of the 2021 Census, its population was 9,286.

In the 12th century, Suzdal became the capital of the principality. Currently, Suzdal is the smallest of the Russian Golden Ring towns. It has several sites listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

==History==
The town&#x27;s history dates back to 999 and 1024. In 1125 Yury Dolgoruky made Suzdal the capital of the Rostov-Suzdal principality. In 1157, Andrei Bogolyubsky moved the capital from Suzdal to Vladimir, from which time the principality was known as Vladimir-Suzdal. Suzdal was burned and plundered in 1237 during the Mongol-led invasions; however, it remained a trade center afterward due to its location in a fertile wheat-growing area. In 1341, it united with Nizhny Novgorod until both were annexed by Moscow in 1392.

After a decline in political significance, the town regained prominence as a religious center, with development projects funded by Vasily III and Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century. In the late 17th and 18th centuries, wealthy merchants funded the construction of 30 churches, many of which still stand today.

In 1864, local merchants failed to convince the government to build the Trans-Siberian Railway through their town. Instead, it went through Vladimir, away. In 1967, Suzdal earned a federally protected status, which officially limited development in the area.

In 1943, high-ranking Nazi officers captured at the Battle of Stalingrad were imprisoned within Suzdal&#x27;s monastery.

Today, the town serves as a tourist center, containing many examples of old Russian architecture. Much of its rural infrastructure and partially unpaved streets have been preserved.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Suzdal serves as the administrative center of Suzdalsky District, to which it is directly subordinated. As a municipal division, the town of Suzdal is incorporated within Suzdalsky Municipal District as Suzdal Urban Settlement.

==Tourism==
The primary industry of Suzdal is tourism. Suzdal avoided the industrialization of the Soviet era and thus 13th-19th architecture remained preserved. There are 305 monuments and listed buildings in Suzdal, including 30 churches, 14 bell towers, and 5 monasteries and convents. 79 of them are federally protected buildings and 167 are regionally protected.

In 1982, Suzdal became the first Russian town to receive &quot;La Pomme d&#x27;Or&quot; &quot;(Golden Apple)&quot; - a prize for excellence in the tourism industry, awarded annually by the World Federation of Travel Journalists and Writers (FIJET).

In 1992, two of the monuments (Saviour Monastery of St Euthymius and Kremlin with Nativity of the Virgin Cathedral) were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, together with six other White Monuments in the region.
===Notable buildings===

*The Kremlin is the oldest part of Suzdal, dating from the 10th century. It is a predecessor of the Moscow Kremlin. In the 12th century, it was the base of Prince Yury Dolgoruky, who ruled the northeastern part of Kievan Rus&#x27; and founded an outpost, which is now Moscow. A &quot;posad&quot; (settlement) to the east became home to the secular population, such as shopkeepers and craftsmen, while the &quot;Kremlin&quot; (fortress) proper was the home of the prince, the archbishop, and the high clergy. Within the Kremlin, the Archbishop’s Chambers house the &quot;Suzdal History Exhibition&quot;, which includes a visit to the 18th-century Cross Hall, which was used for receptions. More exhibits are provided in the 1635 Kremlin bell tower (Russian: Звонница) in the yard.
*The earth rampart of the Kremlin encloses a number of houses and churches, including the Nativity of the Virgin Cathedral. The cathedral, characterized with gold and blue domes, was constructed in 1222–1225 by Yury II on the site of an earlier church built around 1102 by Vladimir Monomakh. It was built of light tufa with limestones for details. In 1445 the cathedral collapsed and was rebuilt in 1528–1530 with the upper structure and drums being constructed of new brick. The original 13th-century door from the cathedral is now on exhibition in the Archbishop&#x27;s Chambers.
*Saviour Monastery of St Euthymius, was founded in 1352 to the north of the town centre on the high bank of the Kamenka river. It was built under the order of the Suzdal-Nizhniy Novgorod prince Konstantin. The monastery was planned as a fortress and was originally enclosed by a wooden wall, later destroyed by the Poles. Today&#x27;s reddish brick walls of the Suzdal monastery were erected over four years, from 1640 to 1644. The fortifications have 12 towers constructed to house artillery power. Later in 1766, with Catherine the Great&#x27;s orders, the monastery became a prison, which had a reputation for severe punishment of prisoners. In 1905 the prison closed; however, it later served as a prison again during the Soviet Era.

*The Wooden Church of St. Nicholas, originally built in Glotovo in 1766 and made entirely of wood, was moved to Suzdal in 1960 to become part of the Museum of Wooden Architecture and Peasant Life. The church is elevated off the ground about a story high from when it was moved across the country.
*St John the Baptist Church, built in 1720, at the same time as the Wooden Church of St. Nicholas. It was constructed with white plastered walls and wooden supports.
*St Alexander Convent, built in 1240 by an unknown architect. The princesses of Suzdal, Mariya and Agrippina, were buried here in the 14th century.
*, founded in 1364. In its centre stands the Cathedral of the Intercession, an add-on built in 1518, financed by Moscow&#x27;s King Vasili III. The interior of the cathedral is plain white stone, with no paintings nor stained glass. The church houses the burial vaults of 20 nuns of noble birth. An art museum containing works created in the 16th and 17th centuries is connected to the cathedral.

===Festivals===
*Open Russian Festival of Animated Film, held annually in March since 2002, with the support of the Russian Ministry of Culture.
*&quot;Cucumber Day Festival&quot; with folk music performances is celebrated by locals on the second Saturday of July, every year since 2001.

<text>Wind Song was a 4-masted motor sailing yacht used as a cruise ship by Windstar Cruises from 1987 until 2002, when the ship suffered an engine room fire.

&quot;Wind Song&quot; was one of an unusual class of only three vessels (, and &quot;Wind Song&quot;), designed as a modern cruise ship but carrying an elaborate system of computer-controlled sails on four masts. The ship&#x27;s usual itinerary was an inter-island cruise in French Polynesia and in the Bahamas.

== Fire ==
On December 1, 2002, according to a first-hand passenger account, an engine room fire forced passengers into lifeboats at 3:15 a.m. where they&#x27;d hoped to stay only until the fire was under control. At 5:04 a.m. a small explosion was heard from the front of the ship and the captain gave the order to abandon ship. All 127 passengers and 92 crew members were evacuated safely. 
Passengers were transported by fast ferry to Raiatea, a nearby island where they arrived at approx 8 a.m. Over the course of that day, they were flown on scheduled and charter Air Tahiti flights to Papeete.
The French Navy put out the fire and towed the ship to Papeete, where examination showed extensive damage to engineering spaces, although the passenger areas were mostly intact. Subsequently the Navy demanded compensation for its services, and French Polynesian government seized the &quot;Wind Song&quot;. However, both Holland America Line (owner of Windstar Cruises at the time, itself a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation &amp; plc) and Carnival Corporation &amp; plc was unwilling to pay the costs involved, and even scrapping was uneconomical, because of the ship&#x27;s small size and remoteness from shipbreakers in India, China, and elsewhere.

On January 22, 2003, with the agreement of Holland America and Carnival, the President of the Territorial Government of French Polynesia, Gaston Flosse, ordered the scuttling of the &quot;Wind Song&quot;. That night the ship was towed into the Sea of the Moon between Tahiti and Moorea and sunk in 9,843 feet of water, at latitude 17.45S, longitude 149.48W.

It is situated on the B5470 road west of, and in the parish of Chapel-en-le-Frith, near the northern edge of the Combs Reservoir.

It is the location of Tunstead Dickey, a &quot;Screaming Skull&quot;, and is mentioned in &quot;Highways and Byways in Derbyshire&quot; by J B Frith, a guide published in 1905, and in &quot;Black&#x27;s Guide&quot; published throughout the 19th century.

The name Tunstead is likely derived from hundred homestead and Milton from mill town.

The hamlet had in the past a post office, a garage and two public houses, all of which have now closed.

It should not be confused with Tunstead, which is roughly five miles to the southeast, near Wormhill.

<text>USS &quot;Narwhal&quot; (SS-167), the lead ship of her class of submarine and one of the &quot;V-boats&quot;, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the narwhal. She was named &quot;V-5&quot; (SC-1) when her keel was laid down on 10 May 1927 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine.

==Design==

&quot;V-5&quot; was generally similar to the preceding submarine minelayer &quot;V-4&quot;, although slightly smaller and lacking a minelaying system. The configuration of &quot;V-4&quot;, &quot;V-5&quot;, and &quot;V-6&quot; resulted from an evolving strategic concept that increasingly emphasized the possibility of a naval war with Japan in the far western Pacific. This factor, and the implications of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, suggested the need for long-range submarine &quot;cruisers&quot;, or &quot;strategic scouts&quot;, as well as long-range minelayers, for which long endurance, not high speed, was most important. The design was possibly influenced by the German &quot;U-cruisers&quot; of the Type U-139 and Type U-151 U-boat classes, although &quot;V-4&quot;, &quot;V-5&quot;, and &quot;V-6&quot; were all larger than these. A raised gun platform was provided around the conning tower, and deck stowage for spare torpedoes was included under the platform and in the superstructure. &quot;V-5&quot; and her near-sisters &quot;V-4&quot; () and &quot;V-6&quot; () were initially designed with larger and more powerful MAN-designed diesel engines than the Busch-Sulzer engines that propelled earlier V-boats, which were failures. Unfortunately, the specially built engines failed to produce their design power, and some developed dangerous crankcase explosions. The engineering plant was replaced in 1942.

The as-built engine specifications were two BuEng-built, MAN-designed direct-drive 10-cylinder 4-cycle main diesel engines, each, with two BuEng MAN 4-cycle 6-cylinder auxiliary diesel engines, each, driving electric generators. The auxiliary engines were for charging batteries or for increased surface speed via a diesel-electric system providing power to the main electric motors.

&quot;V-5&quot; was built to a partial welded/partial riveted construction method. Welding was used to join the vertical keel plates, and also in other non-critical areas like the superstructure, piping brackets, and support framing. The inner and outer hulls were still entirely riveted.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;V-5&quot; was launched on 17 December 1929, sponsored by Mrs. Frances Adams (&quot;née&quot; Lovering), wife of Charles F. Adams, Secretary of the Navy, and commissioned on 15 May 1930, Lieutenant Commander John H. Brown Jr. in command.

==Interwar period==
&quot;V-5&quot; departed Annapolis, Maryland on 11 August 1930 for a cruise to the West Indies, returning to Portsmouth on 11 September. She trained in New England waters until 31 January 1931, when she sailed for the West Coast via the Panama Canal, arriving San Diego on 4 April. On 19 February, &quot;V-5&quot; was renamed Narwhal and on 1 July received the new hull number SS-167. After overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, &quot;Narwhal&quot; departed on 2 February 1932 for fleet exercises off Hawaii. She returned to San Diego on 17 March. After patrol duty along the West Coast, the submarine got underway on 12 July 1934 for a cruise with Submarine Division 12 (SubDiv 12) until her arrival at San Diego on 18 September. For the next three years, she operated as far north as Seattle, Washington and as far west as Pearl Harbor, which became her home base for operations through 1941. On a 30 day pre-war training cruise in 1941, &quot;Narwhal&quot; lost 20,000 gallons of fuel oil due leakage from her riveted fuel tanks.

==World War II==
&quot;Narwhal&quot; was one of four submarines in overhaul caught by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in the early morning of 7 December 1941. Within minutes of the first enemy bomb explosions on Ford Island, &quot;Narwhal&quot;″s gunners were in action to assist in the destruction of two torpedo planes.

===1st–3rd Patrols and overhaul, February 1942 – April 1943===
On her first war patrol – from 2 February to 28 March 1942 – &quot;Narwhal&quot;, with Lieutenant Commander Charles W. &quot;Weary&quot; Wilkins in command, departed Pearl Harbor to reconnoiter Wake Island on 15–16 February, then continued on to the Ryukyu Islands. On 28 February, she made her first torpedo attack of the war, heavily damaging &quot;Maju Maru&quot;. Six days later, the submarine sank &quot;Taki Maru&quot; in the East China Sea.

She spent her second war patrol – from 28 May – 13 June – in defense of Midway Atoll. As Task Force 16 with the aircraft carriers , , and Task Force 17 with , prepared to meet the Japanese attack, &quot;Narwhal&quot; joined and in scouting east of Midway; during the Battle of Midway on 3–6 June, these submarines – along with 15 others – accomplished nothing as the Japanese did not move east of Midway.

&quot;Narwhal&quot;″s third patrol – from 7 July – 26 August – took her close to Hokkaidō to stalk Japanese shipping off the Kurile Islands. She claimed two small inter-island freighters on 24 and 28 July. One reference credits &quot;Narwhal&quot; with &quot;3&quot; sinkings on 24 July. However, it is likely that the gunboat mentioned was too small to be considered in the official tally, and the other two sinkings are the ones that took place around this date. On 1 August, &quot;Narwhal&quot; included &quot;Meiwa Maru&quot; to her credit despite aircraft bomb and depth charge retaliation. One reference credits Narwhal with an additional sinking on 1 August (the tanker &quot;Koan Maru&quot;). Seven days later, she sank &quot;Bifuku Maru&quot;. On the morning of 14 August, the submarine raised her periscope to discover three enemy destroyers crossing her stern in column. She waited while the destroyers &quot;were running all over the ocean&quot; dropping depth charges. Only slightly damaged, &quot;Narwhal&quot; departed her patrol area the next day.

On 8 September, &quot;Narwhal&quot; sailed from Pearl Harbor for the West Coast, arriving Mare Island Navy Yard on 15 September for overhaul. Her aging BuEng MAN engines were replaced at this time with four GM-Winton 16-278As and other upgraded machinery, including more powerful electric motors and new batteries. She also received four external torpedo tubes, two in the bow and two on top of the stern casing, and may have received increased torpedo deck stowage as well. She went on to San Diego on 4 April 1943, arriving two days later to embark a company of the 7th Infantry Division Provisional Scout Battalion (including Alaskan Native scouts of the Alaska Territorial Guard) for the invasion of Attu Island. On 18 April, she set course for Alaska, arriving at Dutch Harbor on 27 April.

===4th–8th Patrols, April 1943 – December 1943===
The submarine began her fourth war patrol – from 30 April to 25 May – departing Dutch Harbor for the western Aleutian Islands. She rendezvoused with sister ship on 11 May off the northern side of Attu Island, and the two ships debarked Army Scouts in rubber boats for the preliminary landings in the recapture of the island, a venture successfully completed on 29 May. &quot;Narwhal&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor with a stopover at Dutch Harbor on 14 and 18 May.

With Commander Frank D. Latta in command, she again got underway for the Kurile Islands on her fifth war patrol, from 26 June – 7 August. Her mission – beginning on 11 July – was to create diversion by bombarding an air base on Matsuwa. , , and &quot;Plunger&quot; were about to attempt an exit from the previously impenetrable Sea of Japan which they had so daringly invaded. The night of 15 July, &quot;Narwhal&quot; drew so much enemy attention to her presence she was forced to dive from the shells, but she accomplished her mission: the other submarines slipped through Etorofu Strait without detection.

&quot;Narwhal&quot; made her sixth war patrol – from 31 August to 2 October – off the Marshall Islands. On the morning of 11 September, she torpedoed and sank &quot;Hokusho Maru&quot; before a Japanese escort caught up with her. After a severe depth charging, she departed for the Kwajalein Atoll area. By the end of September, the submarine was en route to Brisbane.

Upon arrival, &quot;Narwhal&quot; prepared to participate in the campaign to assist the guerrilla movement in the Philippines begun in January 1943, when disembarked six Filipinos and a ton of equipment on Negros Island. &quot;Narwhal&quot; eventually became the leading submarine in supporting the Philippine guerrilla movement with nine secret transport missions to her credit.

&quot;Narwhal&quot; was loaded down with of ammunition and stores and a party of ten for her seventh patrol, from 23 October – 22 November, supporting Philippine guerrillas. She was in the Sulu Sea, off Mindanao, the night of 10 November &quot;en route&quot; to Puluan Bay when two Japanese ships astern opened fire. The night of 13 November, she entered Ptiluan Bay stealthily to disembark her passengers and half of her cargo while lying off the starboard side of &quot;Dona Jitana Maru&quot;. By midnight &quot;Narwhal&quot; was safely on her way to Nasipit, on Mindanao, where she docked on 15 November to unload the rest of her stores to the tune of &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; played by a grateful Filipino band. She then embarked 32 evacuees, including eight women, two children, and a baby, for Darwin, Australia, and the end of her patrol.

Picking up such odd assortments of passengers and secret cargo soon became routine for &quot;Narwhal&quot;. She departed on her eighth war patrol – from 25 November – 18 December – with the usual cargo and 11 Army operatives bound for Cabadbaran, on Mindanao, arriving Butuan Bay on 2 December for disembarking. With seven evacuees on board, &quot;Narwhal&quot; sailed for Majacalar Bay, arriving off Negros Island on 3 December. Taking on nine more people, she stood out of Alajacalar Bay on 5 December. Around sunrise that same day, the submarine sank &quot;Hinteno Maru&quot; in a blaze of gunfire. On 11 December, she disembarked her passengers at Port Darwin, then continued on to Fremantle, Western Australia.

===9th–12th Patrols, January 1944 – July 1944===
On her ninth war patrol – from 18 January to 15 February 1944 – the submarine returned to Darwin to embark observer Commander F. Kent Loomis and more stores. Following a nighttime transit of the Surigao Strait, &quot;Narwhal&quot; slipped west and north, made a submerged patrol off Naso Point, Panay, then headed for Pandan Bay to transfer cargo to sailing craft. With six new passengers, she came off Negros Island on 7 February to deposit 45 tons of supplies. &quot;Narwhal&quot; then received 28 more evacuees for the trip to Darwin, including Professor Roy Bell and family.

On her tenth war patrol – from 16 February – 20 March – &quot;Narwhal&quot; delivered more ammunition to Butuan Bay on 2 March. With 28 new people on board, she departed on 3 March for Tawi-Tawi. That evening, she damaged &quot;Karatsu&quot; (the captured USS &quot;Luzon&quot; (PR-7)) and was heavily bombarded with depth charges by enemy escorts for her trouble. On the night of 5 March, two small boats – assisted by rubber boats from &quot;Narwhal&quot; – put off for shore with cargo. Three Japanese destroyers closed in later; she eluded them and transferred her passengers, now a total of 38, to &quot;Chinampa&quot; on 11 March before docking at Fremantle.
&quot;Narwhal&quot;, with Commander Jack C. Titus in command, departed on her 11th war patrol – from 7 May – 9 June – for Alusan Bay, Samar, where she landed 22 men and supplies, including electric lamps, radio parts, and flour for the priests, the night of 24 May. By 1 June, the submarine was unloading 16 men and stores on the southwest coast of Mindanao. She ended this patrol at Port Darwin.)

The twelfth war patrol – from 10 June – 7 July – gave &quot;Narwhal&quot; a chance for some action. On 13 June, she submerged for reconnaissance of Bula, Ceram Island, an enemy fuel depot. That night, the submarine closed the shore and fired 56 rounds of 6-inch (152 mm) projectiles to destroy several gasoline storage tanks and set fires around a power house and pumping station area before she had to retreat from the salvos directed at her. Three minutes before sunset on 20 June, she rendezvoused with native boats to send her cargo ashore during a suspenseful nine and one-half hours. Within 30 minutes she had completed unloading and taking on 14 evacuees, but a submarine chaser was in her wake. &quot;Narwhal&quot; evaded him to do some shooting herself the next day at a Japanese motorized sailboat and on 22 June at the tanker &quot;Itsukushima Maru&quot;. After putting her evacuees ashore at Port Darwin on 29–30 June, she continued to Fremantle.

===13th–15th Patrols, Decommissioning, and Scrapping, August 1944 – May 1945===
Her 13th war patrol – from 12 August – 10 September – started at Fremantle and ended at Port Darwin. On the night of 30 August, &quot;Narwhal&quot; surfaced in Dibut Bay on the east coast of Luzon for her usual disembarking procedures, greatly speeded this time by the use of bamboo rafts built by the shore party under the direction of Major Robert Lapham and Lieutenant Commander Charles &quot;Chick&quot; Parsons, a liaison man in the Philippine supply and evacuation missions. Before midnight on 2 September, &quot;Narwhal&quot; sent a party and supplies ashore to a beach off the mouth of the Masanga River, and received four evacuees in return to complete the patrol.

On her 14th war patrol – from 14 September – 5 October – &quot;Narwhal&quot; deposited men and stores on Cebu Island on 27 September, then took off for Siari Bay, where on 29 September she received 31 liberated prisoners-of-war (POWs) rescued from the sea after sank two Japanese transports off Sindagan Point on 7 September. However, according to a POW survivor&#x27;s account, &quot;Narwhal&quot; picked up 82 POW&#x27;s, survivors of the &quot;Shin&#x27;yō Maru&quot; incident, vice 31 at Siari, Mindanao. &quot;Forty-one placed in the forward torpedo room and 41 in the aft torpedo room&quot;. &quot;Narwhal&quot; found herself in danger the afternoon of 30 September, when she submerged to avoid a Japanese antisubmarine patrol plane, her stern planes locked in a 20° down-angle. Forced to blow her main ballast to stop the steep dive, &quot;Narwhal&quot; reversed direction and popped out of the water stern first just two minutes after she went down. Luckily, the patrol plane could not maneuver fast enough to return before she again dove.

After a short refit at Mios Woendi, Dutch New Guinea, &quot;Narwhal&quot; conducted her 15th and last war patrol from 11 October – 2 November, with Commander William G. Holman in command. Friday the 13th brought a near attack by a PBY Catalina. Once the submarine was recognized, the aircraft signaled &quot;GOOD LUCK NARWHAL.&quot; The evening of 17 October she was off a Tawi Tawi beach to deliver of cargo. Two days later she unloaded the rest of her cargo and 37 men at Negros Island and took on her last passengers, 26 in all, for the trip to Brisbane, Queensland.

&quot;Narwhal&quot; departed Brisbane on 6 January 1945 for the east coast via the Panama Canal, entering the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 21 February, where she was decommissioned on 23 April. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 May and sold for scrap. &quot;Narwhal&quot;″s two 6-inch (152 mm) guns are permanently enshrined at the Naval Submarine Base New London, at Groton, Connecticut. There is an oral tradition in the US submarine force that received her hull number as a deliberate re-arrangement of the older &quot;Narwhal&quot;″s hull number of SS-167.

==Awards==
* American Defense Service Medal with &quot;FLEET&quot; clasp
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with 15 battle stars for World War II service
* World War II Victory Medal

&quot;Narwhal&quot;′s 15 battle stars for World War II service tied her with for the most battle stars earned by a submarine, placing them amongst the most decorated US ships of World War II.

==Memorial==

The town of Nasipit in Agusan del Norte, created a memorial in commemoration of the USS Narwhal&#x27;s efforts during World War II.

==In popular culture==
A 1958 episode of the television series &quot;The Silent Service&quot; called &quot;Narwhal&#x27;s Passenger From Mindanao,&quot; detailed a rescue operation involving &quot;Narwhal&quot; under Titus&#x27;s command.

The opening of the movie Operation Pacific may have been inspired by the &quot;Narwhal&#x27;s&quot; seventh war patrol, where 32 civilians, including 8 children and a baby, were evacuated to Australia.

<text>Daniel Louis Schorr (August 31, 1916 – July 23, 2010) was an American journalist who covered world news for more than 60 years. He was most recently a Senior News Analyst for National Public Radio (NPR). Schorr won three Emmy Awards for his television journalism.

==Early life==
Schorr was born in the Bronx, New York, the son of Russian immigrants Tillie Godiner and Gedaliah Tchornemoretz. He began his journalism career at the age of 13, when he came upon a woman who had jumped or fallen from the roof of his apartment building. After calling the police, he phoned the &quot;Bronx Home News&quot; and was paid $5 for his information.

He attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the West Bronx, where he worked on the &quot;Clinton News&quot;, the school paper. He graduated from City College of New York in 1939 while working for the &quot;Jewish Daily Bulletin&quot;. Schorr also worked for the Jewish Telegraphic Agency as a chief news editor from 1934 to 1948. During World War II, Schorr served in Army Intelligence at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.

In January 1967, he married Lisbeth Bamberger, a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley.

== CBS News ==
Following several years as a stringer, including bylines in The New York Times, which led to a tryout but no job despite repeated attempts, in 1953 he joined CBS News as one of the recruits of Edward R. Murrow (becoming part of the later generation of Murrow&#x27;s Boys). In 1955, with the post-Stalin thaw in the Soviet Union, he received accreditation to open a CBS bureau in Moscow. In June 1957, he obtained an exclusive interview with Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet Communist Party chief. It aired on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, Schorr&#x27;s first television interview. Schorr left the Soviet Union later that year, because of Soviet censorship laws. When he applied for a new visa, it was denied by the Soviets.

In January 1962, he aired the first examination of everyday life under communism in East Germany, &quot;The Land Beyond the Wall: Three Weeks in a German City&quot;, which the Times called a &quot;journalistic coup&quot;. After agreeing not to foster &quot;propaganda&quot; for the United States, Schorr was granted the rights to conduct the interviews in Rostock. By airing everyday life, Schorr painted a picture of the necessity for a Communist state to seal itself off from the West in order to survive.

President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Secretary of State Dean Rusk criticized Schorr&#x27;s actions in an August 10, 1962 diplomatic cable for a checkbook journalism story in which, &quot;Schorr involved himself in a matter which was far beyond his private or journalistic responsibilities and proceeded amateurishly in a matter filled with greatest danger for all concerned. As we anticipated, [the] other side turned out to be fully aware of the matter and laid a trap which could have resulted in [a] massacre [of] those involved.” A meeting with the State Department over the matter recorded in a cable stated, &quot;Schorr appeared chastened by fact that a plan which was to be his greatest achievement had failed. He did not give slightest appearance of being contrite.&quot;

In 1964, Schorr reported—inaccurately— that right-wing Germans were enthusiastic about presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, and that Goldwater had planned a postconvention trip mainly involving an American military recreation center in Berchtesgaden, site of a favorite Hitler retreat.

==1970s==
Schorr attracted the anger of Richard Nixon&#x27;s White House. In 1971, after a dispute with White House aides, Schorr&#x27;s friends, neighbors, and co-workers were questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his habits. They were told that Schorr was under consideration for a high-level position in the environmental area. Schorr knew nothing about it. Later, during the Watergate hearings, it was revealed that Nixon aides had drawn up what became known as Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List, and Daniel Schorr was on that list. Famously, Schorr read the list aloud on live TV, surprised to be reading his own name in that context. Schorr won Emmys for news reporting in 1972, 1973, and 1974.

Schorr provoked intense controversy in 1976 when he received and made public the contents of the secret Pike Committee report on illegal Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and FBI activities. Called to testify before Congress, he refused to identify his source on First Amendment grounds, risking imprisonment. This did not mollify CBS executives, and Schorr ultimately resigned from his position at CBS in September 1976. Although scolded at first for his television report by former CIA director Richard Helms, Schorr was vindicated by the text of the report, which he had obtained from an undisclosed source and sent to &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

Schorr &quot;remained silent in the face of false suspicions that another CBS correspondent, Lesley Stahl, had given the (Pike) report to The Voice&quot;. Roger Mudd stated in his autobiography that Schorr personally spread rumors that Stahl had leaked the paper, while Stahl in her autobiography stated that she was &quot;flabbergasted&quot; at the accusation from Schorr and the resulting furor within CBS as the executives were &quot;deciding what to do&quot; with her over the serious journalistic breach she was accused of, while Nora Ephron reports that Stahl considered a slander suit against Schorr. Schorr later donated his profits from the sale of the Pike papers to the Reporters&#x27; Committee for Freedom of the Press.

On May 14, 2006, on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition&quot;, Schorr mentioned a meeting at the White House that took place with colleague A. M. Rosenthal and president Gerald Ford. Ford mentioned that the Rockefeller Commission had access to various CIA documents, including those referring to political assassinations.

==Later work==
In 1977, Schorr was hired by Reese Schonfeld as a White House correspondent for ITNA (Independent Television News Association), a news agency serving independent television news stations in the U.S. In 1979, Schonfeld and Ted Turner brought Schorr to Cable News Network (CNN), where he was the first on-camera employee hired. He reported news and delivered commentary and news analysis on the fledgling CNN. His contract was not renewed in 1985, one of the two times he stated he was &quot;fired&quot;. He then took the position as Senior News Analyst at NPR, a position he held for decades up to the time of his death. In that position, he regularly commented on current events for programs including &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and &quot;Weekend Edition&quot;. He also wrote a column for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; for several decades. Schorr was called &quot;reliably liberal&quot;, and was &quot;widely regarded as a liberal&quot; according to another source, though he regarded the label as inaccurate.

In 1994, Schorr narrated the TV miniseries, &quot;Watergate&quot;. In the late 1990s, he appeared briefly as a newscaster in three Hollywood movies: &quot;The Net&quot; (1995), &quot;The Game&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Siege&quot; (1998). In &quot;The Game&quot;, Schorr appeared as himself as an agent of an organization that interferes with the main character&#x27;s life. He also appeared as himself in the docufiction film &quot;World War Three&quot; that presented an alternative ending to the USA/USSR Cold War.

Schorr was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002.

==Other==
Though not a fan of rock music, Schorr became friends with composer Frank Zappa after the latter contacted him, asking for help with a voter registration drive. Schorr made an appearance with Zappa on February 10, 1988, where he sang &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Necessarily So&quot; and &quot;Summertime&quot;. Schorr delivered the eulogy on NPR after Zappa&#x27;s death on December 4, 1993; he professed not to understand Zappa&#x27;s lengthy discourses on music theory, but he found a kindred spirit—a serious man with a commitment to free speech.

About 20 years after Nixon&#x27;s resignation, Schorr attended a dinner where Nixon spoke about the Soviet Union. After the dinner ended, Schorr walked up to Nixon and said, &quot;Mr. Nixon, I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;ll remember me.&quot; Nixon replied, &quot;Dan Schorr, damn near hired you once.&quot;

==Death==
Schorr died from an apparent &quot;short illness&quot; on July 23, 2010, at a Washington, D.C. hospital, at the age of 93. Schorr&#x27;s last broadcast commentary for NPR aired on Saturday, July 10, 2010 (on &quot;Weekend Edition&quot;). His remains were buried at Parklawn Memorial Park in Rockville, Maryland.

<doc id="486810" wikidata="Q6413739" url="?curid=486810" title="Kingsway telephone exchange">
<text>Kingsway telephone exchange was a Cold War-era hardened telephone exchange underneath High Holborn in London. Initially built as a deep-level air-raid shelter in the early 1940s, it was instead used as a government communications centre. In 1949 the General Post Office (GPO) took over the building, and in 1956 it became the UK termination point for TAT-1, the first transatlantic telephone cable. Closure of the facility began in the 1980s. It was built together with underground exchanges in Birmingham and Manchester, and was originally covered by a D-Notice.

==History==
The Kingsway telephone exchange was built as a deep-level shelter underneath Chancery Lane tube station in the early 1940s, consisting of two east–west aligned tunnels, one on each side of the Central Line. Although intended for use as an air raid shelter, like many of the deep level shelters, it was not used for its intended purpose and was instead used as a government communications centre. Material from the Public Record Office was stored there from 1945 to 1949.

The site was given to the General Post Office in 1949. At the time, the Post Office was also responsible for telephones as well as postal system. The two-tunnel shelter was extended by the addition of four shorter tunnels, at right angles to the original pair. This extension was completed by 1954, and the exchange opened on 30 October 1954. In 1956 it became the UK termination point for TAT-1, the first transatlantic telephone cable.

Throughout the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, Kingsway Trunk Switching Centre (as it became known) was a trunk switching centre and repeater station with Post Office engineering staff totalling over 200 at its peak. After the exchange was wound down the site was used for the Radio Interference Investigation Group, whose function was to prevent television viewers and radio listeners in north and central London from suffering interference to their service from external sources such as thermostats, fluorescent tubes and injection moulding equipment. The country&#x27;s first radio paging terminal was also installed on this site in the 1970s. In the 1980s it housed Kingsway Computer Centre, a backup for ICARUS (international circuit allocation record update system) 

The site had a staff restaurant, tea bar, games room and licensed bar. Its bar claimed to be the deepest in the United Kingdom, at about 200 feet (60 metres) below street level. The site contained an artesian well and rations to maintain several hundred people for many months, to try to ensure a safe environment in case of nuclear attack.

By the early 1980s the site was subject to a phased closure after large quantities of blue asbestos were found on the site. By 1995 only the main distribution frame was still in service. This reportedly has been removed. Also in the 1990s two of the east most tunnels became a bunker of sorts, possibly a temporary home for PINDAR. This was abandoned by 1996.

In October 2008, British Telecom announced that the tunnels were for sale.

===London Tunnels===
In November 2023, BT Group agreed to sell the tunnels to The London Tunnels, a UK-based group backed by a private equity fund, which planned to restore and preserve them and open them to the public for the first time. Subject to planning approval, working with architect WilkinsonEyre, The London Tunnels&#x27; vision is to create an interactive cultural experience, with an operational capacity of two million visitors per year. The plans envisage investing around £140m on restoring, preserving and fitting-out the site, then £80m on immersive technology and screens. The venue would open to the public in 2027 and would involve the rebuilding of the Furnival Street entrance. In June 2024, City of London Corporation planners approved the £220m scheme; Camden Council approved the scheme in July 2024.

==Entrances==
Kingsway Telephone Exchange has two entrances. One is next to a shopfront at 32 High Holborn, the other is a goods lift on Furnival Street. A third access point, a combination of ventilation towers and a passenger lift at Tooks Court, was demolished in 2001.

==Fiction==
The Exchange features in the third of James Herbert&#x27;s &quot;The Rats&quot; trilogy &quot;Domain&quot;, as a place where survivors of a nuclear attack on London take shelter.

Once home to MI6&#x27;s Special Operations Executive, the tunnels are referenced by Ian Fleming (who worked as an SOE liaison officer) in his first James Bond book &quot;Casino Royale&quot; as the location of M&#x27;s Q Branch laboratories.

<doc id="486820" wikidata="Q623161" url="?curid=486820" title="Red Rocks Park">
<text>Red Rocks Park is a mountain park in Jefferson County, Colorado, owned and maintained by the city of Denver as part of the Denver Mountain Parks system. The park is known for its very large red sandstone outcrops. Many of these rock formations within the park have names, from the mushroom-shaped Seat of Pluto to the inclined Cave of the Seven Ladders. The most visited rocks, around Red Rocks Amphitheatre, are Creation Rock to the north, Ship Rock to the south, and Stage Rock to the east.

The red sandstone found throughout Red Rocks Park is geologically identified as belonging to the Fountain Formation. Other Colorado examples of Fountain Formation geology include nearby Roxborough State Park, Garden of the Gods near Colorado Springs, and the Flatirons near Boulder. The rocks were formed about 290-296 million years ago when the Ancestral Rocky Mountains were eroded during the Pennsylvanian epoch. Later, uplift during the Laramide orogeny tilted the rocks to the angle at which they sit today.

An Army expedition led by Stephen Long discovered present-day Red Rocks in 1820. The park was in times far past a favored campsite of the Ute tribe for it provided natural cover from the elements. Its earliest known name was the Garden of the Angels, reputedly given to it on July 4, 1870, by Martin Van Buren Luther, a pioneer Colorado judge. In 1872, Marion Burts became the first recorded owner of Red Rocks. He sold it to Leonard H. Eicholtz, a civil engineer who helped build the Union Pacific Railway and who developed the property into a park in 1878. Eicholtz added roads, trails, picnic grounds, steps, and ladders so visitors could explore the park. In 1906, Eicholtz sold Red Rocks to famed editor John Brisben Walker which he purchased with proceeds from his sale of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine; Walker organized concerts on a temporary platform at the Garden of the Titans. Known however by the folk name of &quot;Red Rocks&quot; since the area was settled, it was formally given that name when Denver acquired it in 1928 from Walker.

Within the park boundaries is the Red Rocks Amphitheatre, a venue used since 1941. The Amphitheater was designed by Burnam Hoyt within the area between two massive slabs of Red stone (Ship Rock and Creation Rock).

==Park construction==
Denver Mayor Ben Stapleton resisted developing the already beautiful Red Rocks but the city used Depression-era New Deal funding and resources to build out the park, as part of the development of the Denver Mountain Parks system. City planner George Cranmer oversaw the development, securing federal funding and establishment of a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp at Mount Morrison to facilitate the construction of the park&#x27;s features. CCC crews were responsible for building out the early roads and the amphitheater, as well as a Pueblo-style concession stand. The park along with surviving CCC camp (which is one of the best preserved of such camps) were designated a National Historic Landmark in 2015.

==Trails==
There are several short, pedestrian-only trails in the park: Funicular Trail, Geologic Overlook Trail, Mt. Vernon Creek Trail, Red Rocks Trail, and the Trading Post Trail. Other multi-use trails are open to mountain bikes, horses, and leashed dogs.

<text>Beno Gutenberg (; June 4, 1889 – January 25, 1960) was a German-American seismologist who made several important contributions to the science. He was a colleague and mentor of Charles Francis Richter at the California Institute of Technology and Richter&#x27;s collaborator in developing the Richter scale for measuring an earthquake&#x27;s magnitude.

==Early life, family and education==
Gutenberg was born in Darmstadt, Germany. His father owned a factory.

He obtained his doctorate in physics from the University of Göttingen in 1911. His advisor was Emil Wiechert.

==Career==
During World War I, Gutenberg served in the German Army as a meteorologist in support of gas warfare operations.

Gutenberg held positions at the University of Strasbourg, which he lost when Strasbourg became French in 1918. After some years during which he had to sustain himself with managing his father&#x27;s soap factory, he obtained in 1926 a junior professorship at University of Frankfurt-am-Main, which was poorly paid.

Although he was already, in the 1920s, one of the leading seismologists worldwide and definitely the leading seismologist in Germany, he was still dependent on the position in his father&#x27;s factory; however, he continued his research in his spare time.

In 1928, the attempt to become the successor of his academic teacher, Emil Wiechert, in Göttingen, failed. There are hints that Gutenberg&#x27;s Jewish background might have played a role because, already in the 1920s, there were strong antisemitic tendencies in German universities. For similar reasons, he was also not accepted for a professorship in Potsdam to become the successor of Gustav Angenheister.

===Move to the US===
Since Gutenberg could not sustain a career of scientific work in Germany, he accepted a position as Professor of Geophysics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena in 1930, becoming founding director of the Seismological Laboratory when it was transferred to Caltech from Carnegie. Even if he had obtained a full professorship in Germany, he would have lost it in 1933 anyway like so many other scientists of Jewish ancestry, at least 30 of whom emigrated to the United States under Gutenberg&#x27;s sponsorship.

Gutenberg made the California Institute of Technology Seismological Laboratory the leading seismological institute worldwide, especially in his collaboration with Charles Francis Richter. Together, they developed a relationship between seismic magnitude and energy, represented in this equation:

:formula_1

which gives the energy formula_2 given from earthquakes from seismic waves in ergs. Another famous result, known as Gutenberg–Richter law, provides probability distribution of earthquakes for a given energy.

Gutenberg also worked on determining the depth of the core-mantle boundary as well as other properties of the interior of the earth.

In 1952, Gutenberg received the Prix Charles Lagrange from the Académie royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique. Gutenberg remained director of the Seismological Laboratory until 1957. He was succeeded by Frank Press. He died of cancer in California at age 70

== Personal life ==
Beno Gutenberg&#x27;s personal life was marked by the challenges of immigration amidst political turmoil in Germany during the rise of the Nazi regime. Gutenberg faced challenges obtaining visas due to growing Nazi influence in the 1930s.

After leaving Germany to the United States, Beno Gutenberg and his wife, Hertha, were instrumental in aiding individuals seeking refuge from Nazi persecution during the 1930s. Among those they sponsored were former colleagues, students, and friends, including Professor Helmut Landsberg and Professor Victor Conrad. These individuals received support for their education and basic needs, ensuring they were not reliant on welfare or student loans.

Hertha Gutenberg&#x27;s involvement extended beyond financial support; she played a crucial role in facilitating connections and assistance through organizations like the Catholic group in New York, which helped Professor Victor Conrad secure his relocation to the United States.

<text>The Junkers F 13 is the world&#x27;s first all-metal transport aircraft, designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Junkers.

Produced shortly after the end of the First World War, it was a cantilever-wing monoplane with enclosed accommodation for four passengers and a two seat open cockpit. Like all Junkers duralumin-structured designs, from the 1918 J 7 to the 1932 Ju 46, (some 35 models), it has an aluminium alloy (duralumin) structure entirely covered with Junkers&#x27; characteristic corrugated and stressed duralumin skin. Internally, the wing was built up on nine circular cross-section duralumin spars with transverse bracing. All control surfaces were horn balanced.

A total of 322 aircraft were manufactured, a considerably large number for a commercial airliner of the era, and were operated all over the world. It accounted for over a third of air traffic in the early 1920s. It remained in production for thirteen years and in commercial service for more than thirty. There were many versions including floatplanes for water landing, skis, mailplane, and different engines. Several survive in various states of repair in museums, and a replica of the type was put back in production in the 2010s, taking flight once again nearly a century after the type first flew.

==Development==

What would become the F 13 originated in the work of Professor Hugo Junkers and his Research Institute in Dessau, Germany throughout the 1910s. These efforts were responsible for producing multiple new ideas pertaining not only to aerodynamics but also the employment and working of lightweight metal construction in aviation.

The F 13 was a very advanced aircraft when built, an aerodynamically clean all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane. It was the world&#x27;s first all-metal passenger aircraft and Junkers&#x27; first commercial aircraft. The designation letter F stood for &quot;Flugzeug&quot; (aircraft); it was the first Junkers aeroplane to use this system. Earlier Junkers notation labelled it J 13. Russian-built aircraft used the designation Ju 13.

The F 13 first flew on 25 June 1919, powered by a 127 kW (170 hp) Mercedes D.IIIa inline upright water-cooled engine. The first production machines had a wing of greater span and area and was furnished with the more powerful 140 kW (185 hp) BMW IIIa upright inline water-cooled motor.

Many variants were built using Mercedes, BMW, Junkers, and Armstrong Siddeley Puma liquid-cooled inline engines, and Gnome-Rhône Jupiter and Pratt &amp; Whitney Hornet air-cooled radial engines. The variants were mostly distinguished by a two letter code, the first letter signifying the airframe and the second the engine. Junkers L5-engined variants all had the second letter -e, so type -fe was the long fuselage -f airframe with a L5 engine.

The F13 was the basis for developing the Junkers W 33 and Junkers W 34.

==Design==
The Junkers F 13 was an all-metal transport aircraft; its construction and several of its design features, such as its cantilever wing, were particularly noteworthy for the era. Unlike traditional wings of the era, which had to use external struts and guywires out of necessity, the wing of the F 13 lacked any stay-wires; their elimination meant that a major source of drag was entirely avoided. Instead of exposing the supporting elements to the external air currents, all of the bracing was located within the wing itself, thus providing a neater solution from an aerodynamic perspective. As a consequence of this arrangement, the profile of the wing had to be considerable thicker to accommodate these supporting members; while orthodox attitudes of the era favoured thin profiles, the aerodynamic qualities of the F 13 was quite favourable, largely as a result of diligent experimentation. Another advantage was that, while the polar curve for thin profile wings typically had a relatively restricted range of application, such as for high-speed flight or a rapid rate of climb, of a higher climb, the polar curve of thicker profile wings could perform more adequately across both circumstances.

In terms of its material composition, the F 13 had intentionally discarded traditional materials, such as wood and fabric, in favour of an all-metal approach that had been pioneered by Junkers. This switch eliminated concerns over the variable quality of available wood, and the procurement difficulties in obtaining high quality wood that would be well-suited for aeronautical purposes. It also dispensed with various other concerns, as it was perceived as more difficult to maintain the calibrated dimensions of wood due to warping, the same factor also hindered interchangeability; metal posed less of a fire hazard as well. Unlike Junker&#x27;s early metal aircraft, which was composed of steel and thus quite heavy, the F 13 was made of duralumin, a light-weight alloy that would find widespread use in aeronautical circles. This metal has greater uniform strength to the aircraft, which made it easier to design; greater ease of calculation increased the economics of this choice as well.

Somewhat offsetting the difficulties of developing a new arrangement to permit the installation of all supporting framework internally, the use of metal enabled a substantial number of new construction features to be adopted. Although the specific gravity of duralumin is greater than that of wood, the weight of the Junkers F 13 was beneath that of all other airplanes, wood or metal, of the same class, as a result of thorough aerodynamic studies conducted by the company. Furthermore, it was also felt that the metal approach would increase structural safety and serviceability. In comparison to its wooden contemporaries, the F 13&#x27;s all-metal approach was slower to fatigue; it was also less expensive to protect against humidity and most other atmospheric conditions. Termites were unable to damage metal aircraft. It was partially for this reason that use of the F 13 in various tropical countries, particularly those in South America, quickly became commonplace. In general, the life of a metal aircraft was believed to be far greater than that of a wooden one.

The supporting surface, which was the basis of the structure, comprises three parts, in order to facilitate transportation. The outer portions of the wings were secured to the framework of the central wing section, whose spars consisted of nine duralumin tubes, in a manner that assured symmetry of the wings. These wings could be mounted and demounted by two men within a few minutes. A cantilever girder comprised the core of the wing&#x27;s framework. The external metal covering, which was corrugated for increased strength, helped to withstand the stress of torsion while the overall structure was fairly resistant to dynamic overloading. In another departure from conventional practices of the time, the fuselage was placed on the wing; this permitted the framework of the wing&#x27;s central section to form the base of both the fuselage and the cabin. Accordingly, the aircraft had a relatively strong superstructure while also reducing its weight. One advantage of the position of the wing was that it afforded the best possible protection to the cabin and its occupants, in the event of a rough or emergency landing.

The flight controls were fairly conventional, both the elevator and ailerons were actuated by the pilot via a column with a wheel while the rudder was operated using pedals. Various sliding doors were present for inspection and serviceability purposes for the various control cables, levers, and tubes. Provision was made for the installation of dual flight controls, a feature that was thought to be of particular importance during long-range flights. All of the tail surfaces had fairly large areas that benefitted not only the aircraft&#x27;s manoeuvrability but also its steadiness in flight. Another departure from convention was the means of adjusting the stabilizer to compensate for weight variations; a trimming tank positioned near the rear of the fuselage could offset nose-heaviness or tail-heaviness by means of a pump controlled by the pilot that would withdraw or add sufficient fuel to achieve equilibrium.

The undercarriage was largely composed of steel tubing; a total of four streamlined supports functioned as spring struts. A V-shaped strut arrangement assured sufficient rigidity while the distance between the wheels was thought to be sufficient to prevent the aircraft turning over even during an oblique landing. The tail skid was both jointed and shock-absorbing; it could be readily replaced and was sizable enough to protect the fuselage from sustaining serious damage. Furthermore, special connections were present for the installation of floats, which could be rapidly substituted for the wheels, to convert the F 13 into a floatplane. These floats, which were made of duralumin, were each internally divided into six tight compartments. The aircraft could be similarly equipped for taking off or landing upon snow or ice via the removal of the wheels and substituting them for duralumin runners while a shoe would be attached to the tail skid.

The aerodynamic efficiency of the F 13 meant that less engine power than had been anticipated could be used; various engines from a variety of suppliers could be installed. Easy access to all points of the engine was possible while various components could be exchanged within a short timeframe. The frontal radiator was specially designed by Junkers to possess a high level of efficiency as well as being relatively lightweight; the pilot was able to regulate the engine temperature via the adjustable shutters. Those aircraft intended for use in a tropical country were typically provided with an additional radiator. Considerable attention was paid to the development of propellers, which was shaped by extensive research into aspects such as the pitch, blade section and diameter. The initial propellers used were composed of laminated wood that was protected by metal along their leading edges and achieved a mechanical efficiency at least equal to that of wooden ones. Junkers also worked on metal propellers of its own make, the hollow sections of which diminishes in line with the laws of bodies of uniform resistance. Advantages presented by metal propellers include the ability to replace a single blade (instead of the whole propeller), a lack of sensitivity to climate influences, and the potential to shape the propeller hub to vary the propeller pitch for either speed or climb.

Behind the single engine was a semi-enclosed cockpit for the crew, roofed but without side glazing. There was an enclosed and heated cabin completed with both with windows and doors. Passenger seats were fitted with seat belts, unusual for the time. The F 13 has a fixed conventional split landing gear with a rear skid, though some variants were fitted with floats or on skis. The cabin was relatively sizable and elegantly furnished for the era; in addition to the four passengers it accommodated, room for another passenger or crew member was present alongside the pilot.

==Operational history==

Any manufacturer of civil aircraft immediately after World War I was faced with competition from the very large numbers of surplus warplanes that might be cheaply converted – for example, the DH.9C. German manufacturers had further problems with the restrictions imposed by the Inter-Allied Aeronautical Commission of Control, which banned the production of warplanes and of any aircraft in the period of 1921-22. Junkers picked up orders abroad in 1919 in Austria, Poland and the USA and, in the following years with SCADTA (Colombia) and the United States Post Office Department. John Larsen Aircraft in the USA purchased a production licence, their machines being designated JL-6. In 1922 there were sales in England, France Italy and Japan.

The F13 was a very popular civilian aircraft, carrying it is estimated 40% of the world&#x27;s air traffic in the early 1920s.

In Bolivia, LAB&#x27;s first airplane was a Junkers F 13; first flight took off from Cochabamba on September 23, 1925.

Junkers set up its own airline – Junkers Luftverkehr AG in 1921 to encourage the acquisition of the F 13 by German airlines and was flying 60 of them by 1923. It also established a branch of the airline in Iran. Other marketing techniques were used, providing F 13s on cheap leases and free loans, with such effect that some 16 operators across Europe were flying them. When Junkers Luftverkehr merged into Luft Hansa in 1926, 9.5 million miles had been flown by them. &quot;Luft Hansa&quot; itself bought 55 aircraft and in 1928 waa using them on 43 domestic routes. Even in 1937, its F 13s were flying over 50 flights per week on four routes. They were finally withdrawn in 1938.

Most of the F 13s produced before production ended in 1932 were built at Junkers German base at Dessau. During the difficult 1921–23 period production was transferred to Junkers plants at Danzig and Reval. In 1922–23, Hugo Junkers signed a contract with the Soviet Union to produce the aircraft in a Soviet factory at Fili near Moscow, which became known as &quot;Plant no. 22&quot;. Some of these aircraft served Soviet airlines while others were used by the Red Army.

There were some other military users. The Colombian Air Force used the F 13 (and the related W.33, W.34 and K.43) as bombers in the Colombia–Peru War in 1932–23. The Republic of China flew F 13s converted into scout bombers until the January 28 Incident in 1932, when they were destroyed by the Japanese along with the Shanghai Aircraft Factory. The Turkish Flying Forces flew a few.

A feature that made the F 13 popular internationally was the ease with which its landing gear could be converted to floats. During the formative years of commercial aviation, bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, seas and oceans were more abundant than landing strips and civil airports in many parts of the world, so seaplanes were commonplace and even, in some places, more useful than regular aircraft. Aside from the obvious addition of floats, little modification was needed for this conversion; however, the different configuration could cause issues with directional control, and so some models had their rudder extended to compensate for this.

From their introduction in 1919 F 13s were in service for more than thirty years; the last commercial F 13 was retired in Brazil in 1951.

==Back in production 2009-2019==
A German-Swiss project to build a reconstruction of the F 13 was launched in 2009; the first flight was in September 2016. The reconstruction is equipped with radio and a transponder, and uses a 1930s Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior engine, but is otherwise as close as possible to the original. Additional reconstructions are to be sold for $2.5 million each.

Junkers Flugzeugwerke (SD303) has resurrected the Junkers F 13 as an all-new airplane to honor Hugo Junkers’ achievements. The company completed the aircraft in 2016 and it is at EBACE commemorating the type&#x27;s maiden flight 100 years ago. The model is available for purchase, and three others like it are currently under construction. Work was in progress on the second and third aircraft during 2019, with airframe number two&#x27;s maiden flight planned for early that summer.

The replica F 13 made its maiden flight on 15 September 2016, the culmination of many of years of work on the part of supporters of the project. . The replica was created from original blueprints and also a laser scan of the type at the Museum of Air and Space at Le Bourget, Paris. The replica has 2600 parts and tens of thousands of rivets and is powered by a Wasp radial engine.

<text>ISO 9 is an international standard establishing a system for the transliteration into Latin characters of Cyrillic characters constituting the alphabets of many Slavic and non-Slavic languages.

Published on February 23, 1995 by the International Organization for Standardization, the major advantage ISO 9 has over other competing systems is its univocal system of one character for one character equivalents (by the use of diacritics), which faithfully represents the original spelling and allows for reverse transliteration, even if the language is unknown.

Earlier versions of the standard, ISO/R 9:1954, ISO/R 9:1968 and ISO 9:1986, were more closely based on the international scholarly system for linguistics (scientific transliteration), but have diverged in favour of unambiguous transliteration over phonemic representation.
The edition of 1995 supersedes the edition of 1986.

== ISO 9:1995 ==
The standard features three mapping tables: the first covers contemporary Slavic languages, the second older Slavic orthographies (excluding letters from the first), and the third non-Slavic languages (including most letters from the first). Several Cyrillic characters included in ISO 9 are not available as pre-composed characters in Unicode, nor are some of the transliterations; combining diacritical marks have to be used in these cases. Unicode, on the other hand, includes some historic characters that are not dealt with in ISO 9.

=== Transliteration table ===
The following combined table shows characters for various Slavic, Iranian, Romance, Turkic, Uralic, Mongolic, Caucasian, Tungusic, Paleosiberian and other languages of the former USSR which are written in Cyrillic.


=== National adoptions ===
=== Sample text ===

The following text is a fragment of the Preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Bulgarian:
== ISO/R 9 ==

ISO Recommendation No. 9, published 1954 and revised 1968, is an older version of the standard, with different transliteration for different Slavic languages, reflecting their phonemic differences. It is closer to the original international system of Slavist scientific transliteration.

A German adaptation of this standard was published by the Deutsches Institut für Normung as DIN 1460 (1982) for Slavic languages and supplemented by DIN 1460-2 (2010) for non-Slavic languages.

The languages covered are Russian (RU), Belarusian (BE), Ukrainian (UK), Bulgarian (BG), Serbo-Croatian (SH) and Macedonian (MK). For comparison, ISO 9:1995 is shown in the table below.

Alternative schemes: ISO/R 9:1968 permits some deviations from the main standard. In the table below, they are listed in the columns &quot;alternative 1&quot; and &quot;alternative&quot; &quot;2&quot;.
#The first sub-standard defines some language-dependent transliterations for Russian (RU), Ukrainian (UK), Belarusian (BE) and Bulgarian (BG).
#The second sub-standard permits, in countries where tradition favours it, a set of alternative transliterations, but only as a group. It is identical to the British Standard 2979:1958 for Cyrillic romanization.

<doc id="486833" wikidata="Q1099515" url="?curid=486833" title="Bounds checking">
<text>In computer programming, bounds checking is any method of detecting whether a variable is within some bounds before it is used. It is usually used to ensure that a number fits into a given type (range checking), or that a variable being used as an array index is within the bounds of the array (index checking). A failed bounds check usually results in the generation of some sort of exception signal.

As performing bounds checking during each use can be time-consuming, it is not always done. Bounds-checking elimination is a compiler optimization technique that eliminates unneeded bounds checking.

==Range checking==
A range check is a check to make sure a number is within a certain range; for example, to ensure that a value about to be assigned to a 16-bit integer is within the capacity of a 16-bit integer (i.e. checking against wrap-around). This is not quite the same as type checking. Other range checks may be more restrictive; for example, a variable to hold the number of a calendar month may be declared to accept only the range 1 to 12.

Example in Python:

def set_month(month: int):
 if month &lt; 1 or month &gt; 12:
 raise ValueError(&quot;The month must be between 1 and 12&quot;)
==Index checking==
Index checking means that, in all expressions indexing an array, the index value is checked against the bounds of the array (which were established when the array was defined), and if the index is out-of-bounds, further execution is suspended via some sort of error. Because reading or especially writing a value outside the bounds of an array may cause the program to malfunction or crash or enable security vulnerabilities (see buffer overflow), index checking is a part of many high-level languages.

Early compiled programming languages with index checking ability included ALGOL 60, ALGOL 68 and Pascal, as well as interpreted programming languages such as BASIC.

Many programming languages, such as C, never perform automatic bounds checking to raise speed. However, this leaves many off-by-one errors and buffer overflows uncaught. Many programmers believe these languages sacrifice too much for rapid execution. In his 1980 Turing Award lecture, C. A. R. Hoare described his experience in the design of ALGOL 60, a language that included bounds checking, saying:

A consequence of this principle is that every occurrence of every subscript of every subscripted variable was on every occasion checked at run time against both the upper and the lower declared bounds of the array. Many years later we asked our customers whether they wished us to provide an option to switch off these checks in the interest of efficiency on production runs. Unanimously, they urged us not to—they already knew how frequently subscript errors occur on production runs where failure to detect them could be disastrous. I note with fear and horror that even in 1980, language designers and users have not learned this lesson. In any respectable branch of engineering, failure to observe such elementary precautions would have long been against the law.

Mainstream languages that enforce run time checking include Ada, C#, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Lisp, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, and Visual Basic. The D and OCaml languages have run time bounds checking that is enabled or disabled with a compiler switch. In C++ run time checking is not part of the language, but part of the STL and is enabled with a compiler switch (_GLIBCXX_DEBUG=1 or _LIBCPP_DEBUG=1). C# also supports &quot;unsafe regions&quot;: sections of code that (among other things) temporarily suspend bounds checking to raise efficiency. These are useful for speeding up small time-critical bottlenecks without sacrificing the safety of a whole program.

The JS++ programming language is able to analyze if an array index or map key is out-of-bounds at compile time using existent types, which is a nominal type describing whether the index or key is within-bounds or out-of-bounds and guides code generation. Existent types have been shown to add only to compile times.

== Hardware bounds checking ==

The safety added by bounds checking necessarily costs CPU time if the checking is performed in software; however, if the checks could be performed by hardware, then the safety can be provided &quot;for free&quot; with no runtime cost. An early system with hardware bounds checking was the ICL 2900 Series mainframe announced in 1974. The VAX computer has an INDEX assembly instruction for array index checking which takes six operands, all of which can use any VAX addressing mode. The B6500 and similar Burroughs computers performed bound checking via hardware, irrespective of which computer language had been compiled to produce the machine code. A limited number of later CPUs have specialised instructions for checking bounds, e.g., the CHK2 instruction on the Motorola 68000 series.

Research has been underway since at least 2005 regarding methods to use x86&#x27;s built-in virtual memory management unit to ensure safety of array and buffer accesses. In 2015 Intel provided their Intel MPX extensions in their Skylake processor architecture which stores bounds in a CPU register and table in memory. As of early 2017 at least GCC supports MPX extensions.

<doc id="486838" wikidata="Q1245922" url="?curid=486838" title="Dornier Do X">
<text>The Dornier Do X was the largest, heaviest, and most powerful flying boat in the world when it was produced by the Dornier company of Germany in 1929. First conceived by Claude Dornier in 1924, planning started in late 1925 and after over 240,000 work-hours it was completed in June 1929.

During the years between the two World Wars, only the Soviet Tupolev ANT-20 &quot;Maksim Gorki&quot; landplane of a few years later was physically larger, but at 53 tonnes maximum takeoff weight it was not as heavy as the Do X&#x27;s 56 tonnes.

The Do X was financed by the German Transport Ministry and in order to circumvent conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, which forbade any aircraft exceeding set speed and range limits to be built by Germany after World War I, a specially designed plant was built at Altenrhein, on the Swiss side of Lake Constance.

The type was popular with the public, but a lack of commercial interest and a number of non-fatal accidents prevented more than three examples from being built.

==Design==
The Do X was a semi-cantilever monoplane. The Do X had an all-duralumin hull, with wings composed of a steel-reinforced duralumin framework covered in heavy linen fabric, covered with aluminium paint.

It was initially powered by twelve Siemens-built Bristol Jupiter radial engines in tandem push-pull configuration mountings, with six tractor propellers and six pushers mounted on six strut-mounted nacelles above the wing. The nacelles were joined by an auxiliary wing to stabilise the mountings. The air-cooled Jupiter engines were prone to overheating and could barely lift the Do X to an altitude of . The engines were managed by a flight engineer, who controlled the 12 throttles and monitored the 12 sets of gauges. The pilot would relay a request to the engineer to adjust the power setting, in a manner similar to the system used on maritime vessels, using an engine order telegraph. Many aspects of the aircraft echoed nautical arrangements of the time, including the flight deck, which bore a strong resemblance to the bridge of a vessel. After completing 103 flights in 1930, the Do X was refitted with Curtiss V-1570 &quot;Conqueror&quot; water-cooled V-12 engines. Only then was it able to reach the altitude of necessary to cross the Atlantic. Dornier designed the flying boat to carry 66 passengers on long-distance flights or 100 passengers on short flights.

The luxurious passenger accommodation approached the standards of transatlantic liners. There were three decks. On the main deck was a smoking room with its own wet bar, a dining salon, and seating for the 66 passengers which could also be converted to sleeping berths for night flights. Aft of the passenger spaces was an all-electric galley, lavatories, and cargo hold. The cockpit, navigational office, engine control and radio rooms were on the upper deck. The lower deck held fuel tanks and nine watertight compartments, only seven of which were needed to provide full flotation. Similar to the later Boeing 314, the Do X lacked conventional wing floats, using sponsons (fuselage-mounted stub wings) to stabilize the craft on the water and also act as embarkation platforms for passengers.

Three Do Xs were constructed in total. The original operated by Dornier, and two other machines based on orders from Italy, namely the X2, named &quot;Umberto Maddalena&quot; (registered I-REDI), and X3, named &quot;Alessandro Guidoni&quot; (registered I-ABBN). The Italian variants were slightly larger and used a different powerplant and engine mounts. Dornier claimed the X2 was the largest aircraft in the world at that time. Each was powered by Fiat A-22R V12 water-cooled engines, with the six engine mounts being covered by a streamlined fairing.

A proposed improved version of the Do X designated the Dornier Do 20, in which the pylon-mounted engines were to be replaced by four pairs of diesel engines in nacelles fared into the wing&#x27;s leading edge and driving four propellers, was promoted in 1936, but never advanced beyond a design study.

==Operation==

The &quot;Flugschiff&quot; (&quot;flying ship&quot;), as it was called, was launched for its first test flight on 12 July 1929, with a crew of 14. To satisfy skeptics, on its 70th test flight on 21 October there were 169 on board of which 150 were passengers (mostly production workers and their families, and a few journalists), ten were aircrew and nine were stowaways. The flight set a new world record for the number of people carried on a single flight, a record that would stand for 20 years. After a takeoff run of 50 seconds the Do X slowly climbed to an altitude of . Passengers were asked to crowd together on one side or the other to help make turns. It flew for 40 minutes Flug Revue claims it was the 42nd flight and lasted 53 minutes, and a historical film shows &quot;&quot;) at a maximum speed of before landing on Lake Constance.

To introduce the airliner to the potential United States market the Do X took off from Friedrichshafen, Germany, on 3 November 1930, under the command of Friedrich Christiansen for a transatlantic test flight to New York. The route took the Do X to the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Portugal. The journey was interrupted at Lisbon on 29 November, when a tarpaulin made contact with a hot exhaust pipe and started a fire that consumed most of the left wing. After sitting in Lisbon harbour for six weeks while new parts were fabricated and the damage repaired, the flying boat continued with several further mishaps and delays along the Western coast of Africa and by 5 June 1931 had reached the islands of Cape Verde, from which it crossed the ocean to Natal in Brazil.
The flight continued north via San Juan to the United States, reaching New York on 27 August 1931, almost ten months after departing Friedrichshafen. The Do X and crew spent the next nine months there as its engines were overhauled, and thousands of sightseers made the trip to Glenn Curtiss Airport (now LaGuardia) for sightseeing tours. The Great Depression dashed Dornier&#x27;s marketing plans for the Do X, and it departed from New York on 21 May 1932 via Newfoundland and the Azores to Müggelsee, Berlin, where it arrived on 24 May and was met by a cheering crowd of 200,000.
The Do X2 entered service in August 1931, and the X3 followed in May 1932. Both were initially based at the seaplane station at La Spezia, on the Ligurian Sea, and reassigned to various other bases during their service.
Both orders originated with SANA, then the Italian state airline, but were requisitioned and used by the Italian Air Force primarily for prestige flights and public spectacles. After plans for a first-class passenger service (Genoa–Gibraltar) were deemed unfeasible, the X2 and X3 were used for officer training cruises, aeronaval manoeuvres, and publicity flights.

In April 1936, a plan was floated for a trans-Atlantic service between Berlin and New York via Lisbon and Charleston, South Carolina, with intermediate stops in the Azores and Bermuda, but it never came to pass.

==Final fates==

Germany&#x27;s original Do X was turned over to Deutsche Luft Hansa, the German national airline, after the financially strapped Dornier company could no longer operate it. After a successful 1932 tour of German coastal cities, Luft Hansa planned a Do X flight to Vienna, Budapest, and Istanbul for 1933. The voyage ended after nine days when the flying boat&#x27;s tail section tore off during a botched, overly-steep landing on a reservoir lake near Passau. While the accident was successfully covered up, the Do X was out of service for three years, during which time it changed hands several times before reappearing in 1936 in Berlin, Hormann writes &quot;&quot;Am 5.September 1933 flog Chefeinflieger Wagner die DO-X zum Bodensee zurück. Mit dem Fiasko von Passau begann für DO-X der Weg ins Museum.&quot; (&quot;On 5 September 1933 chief test pilot Wagner flew the DO X back to the Bodensee (Lake Constance). The Passau fiasco started the DO X&#x27;s trip to the museum.&quot;)&quot; The Do X then became the centerpiece of Germany&#x27;s new aviation museum &quot;Deutsche Luftfahrt-Sammlung&quot; at Lehrter Bahnhof.

The Do X remained an exhibit until being destroyed during World War II in a Royal Air Force air raid on the night of 23–24 November 1943. Fragments of the torn-off tail section are displayed at the Dornier Museum in Friedrichshafen. While never a commercial success, the Dornier Do X was the largest heavier-than-air aircraft of its time, and demonstrated the potential for an international passenger air service.

In an accident identical to that of Lufthansa&#x27;s Do X1a, the Italian Do X2 lost its tail section in a botched landing only one month later. After scaling back flights and crew complements during 1934, they were mothballed at Marina di Pisa in 1935, and broken up for scrap in 1937.
