<text>Antonio Leocadio Guzmán Blanco (28 February 1829 – 28 July 1899) was a Venezuelan military leader, statesman, diplomat and politician. He was the president of Venezuela for three separate terms, from 1870 until 1877, from 1879 until 1884, and from 1886 until 1887 and General during the Venezuelan Federal War.

He was a member of the movement known as &quot;Liberalismo Amarillo&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Guzmán was born in Caracas as the son of Antonio Leocadio Guzmán, a Venezuelan journalist, politician as well as founder of the Liberal Party and Carlota Blanco Jerez de Aristeguieta.

==Career==
===Military career and ambassador===
He was banished by the administration of General Julián Castro, and accompanied General Juan Crisóstomo Falcón in his invasion of Venezuela, becoming his general secretary. After the final defeat of Falcón at the Battle of Coplé in September, 1860, Guzmán accompanied his chief in his flight, and was sent to the West Indies to solicit assistance. Toward the end of 1861 he landed again with Falcón on the coast of Coro, and after numerous engagements signed on 22 May 1863, the Treaty of Coche, by which arms were laid down, and a general assembly called at La Victoria, which elected Falcón president and Guzmán vice president. Guzmán was at the same time Minister of Finance, and went to London to negotiate a loan.

In 1863, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Venezuela.

On 7 August, 1863, Guillermo Tell Villegas was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of Venezuela (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores) when he temporarily assumed the role of Guzman during Guzman&#x27;s absence. Tell Villegas remained the 65th Minister of Foreign Affairs of Venezuela until 21 January 1864, when Guzman returned to the role to finish out his term.

Guzman was the Venezuelan ambassador to Spain from 1863 until 1866.

===1868-1877: Return to Venezuela and president===
Upon his return he was for a short time in charge of the executive, and afterward was elected president of congress. After the overthrow of Falcón in 1868, Guzmán left the country, but headed a revolution in 1869, and in 1870 became provisional president with extraordinary powers, ruling the country for seven years as a dictator.

In 1871 Blanco created by decree the &quot;Territorio Colón&quot; (Columbus Territory) which included Los Roques and other adjacent islands.

The Palacio Federal Legislativo, also known as the Capitolio, is a historic building in Caracas, Venezuela which now houses the National Assembly. It was built in 1872 by Guzman to a design by the architect Luciano Urdaneta Vargas. In 1876, under Guzmán, the Universidad de Caracas was moved to the Palacio de las Academias building, whose former colonial façade was rebuilt in the Neo-Gothic style.

===1878-1884: Second term as president===

His successor, General Francisco Linares Alcántara, died in office in December, 1878, and there were several revolutionary uprisings, till Guzmán assumed the government again.

The Venezuelan bolívar was made the national currency in 1879.

Free and compulsory education for ages 7 to 14 was established by decree on 27 June 1880, under President Guzmán, and was followed by the creation of the Ministry of Public Instruction in 1881, also under Guzmán Blanco. In 15 years from 1870, the number of primary schools quadrupled to nearly 2000 and the enrolment of children expanded ten-fold, to nearly 100,000. Falcón Zulia was a state of Venezuela created by initiative of Guzmán in 1881.

He established the Order of the Liberator on 14 September 1880, which was the highest distinction of Venezuela and was appointed for services to the country, outstanding merit and benefits made to the community. &quot;Gloria al Bravo Pueblo&quot; (&quot;Glory to the Brave People&quot;) was adopted as Venezuela&#x27;s national anthem by Guzmán on 25 May 1881.

In the elections of 1883 General Joaquín Crespo, one of his friends, was declared president, and Guzmán became ambassador to France, living with great ostentation in Paris.

===1885-1899: Third and final term===
In 1886, he again assumed the presidency.

During the rule of Guzmán as governor of a few states (from 1871) in the late 1880s when he was known by the epithet &quot;Illustrious American&quot;, Venezuela witnessed all round development (development of Caracas is largely attributed to him) and coffee production in Venezuela increased rapidly as there was an additional support in the form of loans from foreign countries.
According to some historians, Guzmán Blanco led a fairly steady Venezuelan government that was allegedly ripe with corruption. Guzmán Blanco reportedly stole money from the treasury, abused his power, and, after a disagreement with a bishop, expelled any clergy who disagreed with him and seized property belonging to the Catholic Church. When facing severe disapproval during his administration, Guzmán Blanco ordered the body of Simon Bolivar to be exhumed and reburied in the National Pantheon of Venezuela to espouse Bolivar&#x27;s ideals, despite the two men&#x27;s opposing views.

His successor, the undistinguished Hermógenes López, was also understood to be under his influence.

==Politics and legacy==
The autocratic nature of Guzmán&#x27;s regimes was in sharp contradiction with the economic and legal reforms as well as with the achievements brought about. His government was responsible for the creation of the modern currency (bolívar), the restoration of the national anthem, the second national census, the La Guaira and Caracas Railway, the foundation of the Venezuelan Academy of the Language, the telephone service between Caracas and La Guaira, promotion of agriculture and education (Decree of Public and Obligatory Instruction of 1870), stimulus to commerce, and important public works (the National Pantheon, the Capitol, and the Municipal Theater, among others.)

According to historian Charles L. Davis, Guzman has been referred to as an example of a strongman politician.

Also a freemason, he sharply reduced the power of the Roman Catholic Church in Venezuela while in office.

==Personal life==
Guzmán was married to Ana Teresa Ibarra Urbaneja, who served as First Lady of Venezuela from 1870 until 1877, 1879 until 1884, and 1887 until 1888. Due to his marriage he was brother in law with María Ibarra Urbaneja, who married Venezuelan banker Manuel Antonio Matos He is buried in Passy Cemetery in France. After a hundreds years, his remains now rest at the National Pantheon.

Towards the end of the nineteenth century Guzmán built a country house in the region of Antímano, calling it &quot;La Pequeña Versalles&quot; (Little Versailles). Despite being declared a National Monument, the house fell into disuse after Guzman&#x27;s death and was eventually restored in 2004, the building being turned into a sociocultural complex and sports facility.

<doc id="466647" wikidata="Q3722778" url="?curid=466647" title="Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church">
<text>Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church is a Roman Catholic church in Dublin, Ireland maintained by the Carmelite order. The church is noted for having the relics of Saint Valentine, which were donated to the church in the 19th century by Pope Gregory XVI from their previous location in the cemetery of St. Hippolytus in Rome.

The church is on the site of a pre-Reformation Carmelite priory built in 1539. The current structure dates from 1825 and was designed by George Papworth, who also designed St. Mary&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral in Dublin. It was extended and enlarged in 1856 and 1868.

The church also contains relics of St. Albert, a Sicilian who died in 1306. On his feast day (7 August), a relic of the saint is dipped into the water of St. Albert&#x27;s Well, and the Carmelites say that those who piously use the water receive healing of both body and mind through the intercession of St. Albert.

The church also contains a life-size oak figure of Our Lady of Dublin.

The 1825 building features in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833 as , an engraving of a painting by George Petrie of the interior being accompanied by a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon.

<text>Niagara grapes are a variety of the North American grape species &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; (botanical family Vitaceae) and are used as table grapes and for wines, as well as jams and juice. Niagara is the leading green grape grown in the United States. A purple variety, known as &quot;pink&quot; niagara (niágara rosada), exists and is the main niagara cultivated in southern Brazil, principally in the states of São Paulo, where the variety first occurred in 1933, and Rio Grande do Sul. The Niagara grape was created in Niagara County, New York, in 1868 when Claudius L. Hoag and Benjamin W. Clark cross-bred Concord grapes with white Cassady grapes. It was first sold commercially in 1882. Niagara grapes are considered to be poor shipping grapes, and so are usually only found near where they are grown. They are most commonly found in the United States in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Washington, and Ohio, and are also grown in Ontario in Canada, as well as in Brazil, and New Zealand. While only rarely available fresh outside these areas, Niagara grapes are well known to most American consumers as the source of most white grape juice.

==Wines==

The fresh grape is large and juicy, round to oval-shaped, pale greenish-white in color and has a sweet, very pleasant aroma. It also has a sweet and generally pleasant flavor, sometime being described as &quot;foxy&quot;. One reviewer, Paul Bulas, attempted to characterize the &quot;foxy&quot; description. In analyzing the Niagara grape, he detected aromas like candied lemon rind, a Riesling-like diesel aroma, flowery jasmine-like notes, and what he called &quot;a high-toned, candied muskiness.&quot; This latter descriptor he felt was the primary element of the term &quot;foxy&quot;. His opinion of wines made with the grape is that they have unique and interesting properties that are not well known due to Niagara&#x27;s reputation as a less-than-optimum wine grape. A diesel aroma in wine is considered to be a positive attribute, but it can be excessive in wines made with the Niagara grape. One opinion is that Niagara grape skins should not contact the must for too long a time after pressing to avoid an excess of this characteristic.

<text>Major General Frederick Gerard Peake, (12 June 1886 – 30 March 1970), known as Peake Pasha, was a British Army and police officer and creator of the Arab Legion.

==Military career==
The son of Lieutenant Colonel Walter Peake, of Melton Mowbray, Peake was born at Epsom on 12 June 1886. He attended Stubbington House School, Fareham, and graduated from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1906, being commissioned into the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment. He served in India from 1908 to 1913.

During the First World War, Peake served with the Royal Flying Corps in Salonica, and was also an officer serving with the Imperial Camel Corps, part of the British Imperial Egyptian Army, seeing action in the Darfur Expedition. In 1917 he was awarded the Order of the Nile, Fourth Class. He served for a time under Lawrence of Arabia.

In September 1920 Peake, then a captain, left the Imperial Camel Corps to report on the security situation in Transjordan. Security was found to be inadequate, and in October the same year Peake, by then promoted to lieutenant colonel, was ordered by the High Commissioner of Palestine to form two small police forces:

# The Mobile Force, 100 men to guard the Palestine–Amman road.
# 50 men to support the British District Officer posted to Al Karak, east of the Dead Sea.

During the summers of 1921 and 1923, Peake organised the 150-man Reserve Mobile Force, which formed the nucleus of the Arab Legion. This force was made up of Arabs, Kurds, Turks, Chechens and Circassians, armed with German rifles. Due to increasing regional skirmishes, the Reserve Mobile Force was increased in strength to 750 officers and men. This reorganised force thwarted Wahhabi raids in 1922 and the Adwan Rebellion in 1923. Peake became a major general in the army of the Emirate of Transjordan.

==Private life==
In 1937, Peake married Elspeth MacLean Ritchie, younger daughter of Norman Ritchie, of St Boswells, and they had one daughter. In 1939, he retired and was succeeded by John Bagot Glubb. To the Jordanians he became known as &quot;Peake Pasha&quot;.

In retirement, Peake settled at Hawkslee, St Boswells, Roxburghshire, his wife&#x27;s home village. She died in 1967. His daughter, Julia Grace Peake, was born in 1941. She married firstly David Renwick Grant, and secondly the late Sir Hugh Arbuthnot, 7th Baronet.

<doc id="466664" wikidata="Q278818" url="?curid=466664" title="Must">
<text>Must (from the Latin &quot;vinum mustum&quot;; ) is freshly crushed fruit juice (usually grape juice) that contains the skins, seeds, and stems of the fruit. The solid portion of the must is called pomace and typically makes up 7–23% of the total weight of the must. Making must is the first step in winemaking. Because of its high glucose content, typically between 10 and 15%, must is also used as a sweetener in a variety of cuisines. Unlike commercially sold grape juice, which is filtered and pasteurized, must is thick with particulate matter, opaque, and comes in various shades of brown and purple.

==Winemaking==
The length of time the pomace stays in the juice is critical for the final character of the wine. When the winemaker judges the time to be right, the juice is drained off the pomace, which is then pressed to extract the juice retained by the matrix. Yeast is added to the juice to begin the fermentation, while the pomace is often returned to the vineyard or orchard for use as fertilizer. A portion of selected unfermented must may be kept as Süssreserve, to be added as a sweetening component before bottling. Some winemakers create a second batch of wine from the used pomace by adding a quantity of water equivalent to the juice removed, letting the mixture sit for 24 hours, and draining off the liquid. This wine may be used as a drink for the employees of the winemaker or as a basis for some pomace brandies. Grappa, however, must by law be produced only from the pomace solids, with no water added.

===Balsamico===

The must is also an essential ingredient for the production of traditional balsamic vinegar, the special aged vinegar from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, protected under the European protected designation of origin system. Selected bacterial colonies or the lenta in superficie (slow surface) or lenta a truciolo (slow wood shavings) methods are used for acetification, and then there is a maturation phase. Both the acetification and the maturation take place in precious sessile oak (&quot;Quercus petraea&quot;), chestnut, oak, mulberry, and juniper barrels. After a minimum maturation period of 60 days, a group of expert technicians will test the resulting product analytically as well as organoleptically (via taste, aroma, the palette and other senses).

===Mead===
This term is also used by meadmakers for the unfermented honey-water mixture that becomes mead. The analogous term in beer brewing is wort.

==In cookery==
In ancient Greece, must condensed by boiling was called siraion (σίραιον) and was used as a sweetener in the kitchen in various recipes (and as a syrup over teganitai (pancakes)). From the Greeks, the Romans in ancient Rome also used the condensed must in cooking, as a sweetener. Must was boiled in lead or bronze kettles into a milder concentrate called defrutum or a stronger concentrate called sapa. It was often used as a souring agent and preservative, especially in fruit dishes.

Currently, reduced must is used in Greek, other Balkan countries, French and Middle Eastern cookery as a syrup known as petimezi, &quot;pekmez&quot; or &quot;dibis&quot;. In Greece, petimezi is a basic ingredient for a must-custard known as &quot;moustalevria&quot;, and a sweet-meal known as &quot;soutzoukos&quot;, &quot;churchkhela&quot;. The &quot;Moustokoúloura&quot; or &quot;must cookies&quot; are also popular Greek cookies, which are based on a sweet dough made by kneading flour, olive oil, spice, and must. They are made in various shapes and sizes, and they are dark brown in color because of the must and the spice in them. In the wine making areas of South Africa must is used to make a sweet bun known as &quot;mosbolletjies&quot;.

The term petimezi is a Hellenized word of the Armenian/Trebizond term petmez. Petmez was a type of syrup that was made with berries of the White Mulberry tree; petmez was used in Byzantium (Trebizond was part of the Byzantine Empire), where White Mulberries grew in abundance, for their berries and for the silk worms that feed exclusively on Mulberry leaves.

===Roman lead poisoning hypothesis===
Geochemist Jerome Nriagu published an article in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; in 1983 hypothesizing that defrutum and &quot;sapa&quot; may have contained enough lead acetate to be toxic to those who consumed them regularly.

==In Christian liturgy==
In Catholic Eucharistic liturgy, must may be substituted for sacramental wine, on condition that the ordinary has granted permission for the benefit of a priest or lay person who should not, usually because of alcoholism, ingest wine; but in normal circumstances it may not be used in place of wine.

Official Catholic documents define must (&quot;mustum&quot; in Latin) precisely as &quot;grape juice that is either fresh or preserved by methods that suspend its fermentation without altering its nature (for example, freezing)&quot;, and it excludes pasteurized grape juice.

This teaching goes back at least to Pope Julius I (337–352), who is quoted in Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; as having declared that in case of necessity, but only then, juice pressed from a grape could be used. Aquinas himself declared that it is forbidden to offer fresh must in the chalice, because this is unbecoming owing to the impurity of the must; but he added that in case of necessity it may be done.

Aquinas himself declared:

Must has already the species of wine, for its sweetness [&quot;Aut dulcis musti Vulcano decoquit humorem&quot;; Virgil, &quot;Georg.&quot; i, 295] indicates fermentation, which is &quot;the result of its natural heat&quot; (&quot;Meteor.&quot; iv); consequently this sacrament can be made from must. ... It is forbidden to offer must in the chalice, as soon as it has been squeezed from the grape, since this is unbecoming owing to the impurity of the must. But in case of necessity it may be done: for it is said by the same Pope Julius, in the passage quoted in the argument: &quot;If necessary, let the grape be pressed into the chalice.&quot;

===Liturgical norms===
The latest document from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on the matter, issued on 24 July 2003, gave the following norms, which simplify those previously in force:

The ordinary is competent to give permission for an individual priest or layperson to use mustum for the celebration of the Eucharist. Permission can be granted habitually, for as long as the situation that occasioned the granting of permission continues (e.g., the priest is an alcoholic).

When the principal celebrant at a concelebration has permission to use mustum, a chalice of normal wine is to be prepared for the concelebrants.

Given the centrality of the celebration of the Eucharist in the life of a priest, one must proceed with great caution before admitting to Holy Orders those candidates unable to ingest alcohol without serious harm.

Attention should be paid to medical advances in the area of alcoholism and encouragement given to the production of unaltered mustum.

<doc id="466672" wikidata="Q430191" url="?curid=466672" title="Chinese crested tern">
<text>The Chinese crested tern (Thalasseus bernsteini) is a tern in the family Laridae. It is the county bird of Lienchiang County, Fuchien.

==Taxonomy==
It is most closely related to greater crested tern &quot;T. bergii&quot;, and has hybridised with it.

The species was formerly known as &quot;Sterna zimmermanni&quot; (or &quot;Thalasseus zimmermanni&quot;), until the rediscovery of the previously lost type specimen of Hermann Schlegel&#x27;s &quot;Sterna bernsteini&quot; in 1975 showed that his older name applied to this species, and not to &quot;T. bergii&quot; as had been thought before.

==Description==
It is a medium-large tern 38–43 cm long, closely similar in appearance to Sandwich tern &quot;T. sandvicensis&quot;, Cabot&#x27;s tern &quot;T. acuflavidus&quot;, and lesser crested tern &quot;T. bengalensis&quot;. It is most similar to the former, differing in the bill pattern, which is the reverse of the Sandwich tern&#x27;s, being yellow with a black tip; the bill is also stouter, like Cabot&#x27;s. Like these, it has a full black crown in the breeding season, a pale, silvery-grey back and wings, and a white tail. From the lesser crested tern, which it overlaps in wintering distribution, it can be told by the white rump and paler grey mantle, as well as the black tip to the stouter bill, which seen from up close also has a white point. The larger greater crested tern, despite being its closest relative, differs more obviously in its all-yellow bill, white forehead in the breeding season, and much darker grey mantle and rump, as well as its larger size.

==Distribution and conservation==
It is a critically endangered species, and previously thought extinct. Four pairs were rediscovered in 2000 nesting in a greater crested tern colony on an islet in the Matsu Islands (a territory governed by Taiwan), just off the coast of Fujian Province, China, and wintering south to the Philippines. In the past, it had a wider distribution of the Chinese east coast north to Shandong Province. The decline is thought to be due to past hunting and egg collection for food. This colony may have been protected due to the islands&#x27; disputed status (administered by the Taiwanese government but claimed by mainland China), and the military sensitivity of the area, which has restricted access. The islet has now been declared a wildlife sanctuary. It is possible that other small colonies may yet be found off the Chinese and Taiwanese coasts; migrant birds have been seen near the mouth of the Pachang River in southern Taiwan. The total population is speculated to be less than 50 birds.

In 2007, it was estimated that the Chinese crested tern would be extinct in five years if authorities would not protect it. BirdLife International stated that a survey of Chinese experts found that the number of crested terns fell to 50 birds, half the population of 2004. A Chinese survey team led by Chen Shuihua stated that the bird was &quot;on the verge of extinction&quot;.

It is currently threatened by illegal egg collection, typhoons, and disturbance of nesting colonies by fishermen. There is also a threat from hybridisation with the greater crested tern.

In 2016, for the first time, Chinese crested terns were found breeding in South Korea. Setting up a new colony in such a faraway area would prove a boon for the species.

===Philippines===
The first recorded sighting in the Philippines was in 1886 and then in 1905 in Manila Bay and in 1937. The next records were in March 2018, and along the coastal wetlands of Panabo, Davao del Norte, in November 2019. One was found along the shores of Lingayen Gulf in August 2021.

Three birds were seen at the mouth of the Davao River in 2022 during the Annual Asian Waterfowl Census for migratory birds.

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (Philippines) said at least 3 birds were seen in Panabo City and Carmen, Davao del Norte and in Bucana, Talomo District, Davao City with other migratory birds in January 2023. One was at Bulacan in December 2023 along the sandbar that straddles the boundary between Santa Cruz, Paombong, and Pamarawan Island in Malolos northwest of New Manila International Airport.

<doc id="466673" wikidata="Q106221" url="?curid=466673" title="James Horner">
<text>James Roy Horner (August 14, 1953 – June 22, 2015) was an American film composer and conductor. He worked on more than 160 film and television productions between 1978 and 2015. He was known for the integration of choral and electronic elements alongside traditional orchestrations, and for his use of motifs associated with Celtic music.

Horner won two Academy Awards for his musical composition to James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), which became the best-selling orchestral film soundtrack of all time. He also wrote the score for the highest-grossing film of all time, Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009). Horner&#x27;s other Oscar-nominated scores were for &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), &quot;An American Tail&quot; (1986), &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; (1989), &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (1995), &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995), &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; (2001), and &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; (2003). Horner&#x27;s other notable scores include &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982), &quot;Willow&quot; (1988), &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988), &quot;Glory&quot; (1989), &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; (1991), &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; (1994), &quot;Jumanji&quot; (1995), &quot;Casper&quot; (1995), &quot;Balto&quot; (1995), &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (1998), &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998), &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; (2000), &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; (2000), &quot;Troy&quot; (2004), &quot;The New World&quot; (2005), &quot;The Legend of Zorro&quot; (2005), &quot;Apocalypto&quot; (2006), &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (2012).

Horner collaborated on multiple projects with directors including James Cameron, Don Bluth, Ron Howard, Joe Johnston, Edward Zwick, Walter Hill, Mel Gibson, Vadim Perelman, Jean-Jacques Annaud, Nicholas Meyer, Wolfgang Petersen, Martin Campbell, Phil Nibbelink and Simon Wells; producers including Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, David Kirschner, Brian Grazer, Jon Landau, and Lawrence Gordon; and songwriters including Will Jennings, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. Adding to his two Academy Awards win, Horner also won six Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, and was nominated for three BAFTA Awards.

Horner, who was an avid pilot, was killed in a single-fatality crash while flying his Short Tucano turboprop aircraft. He was 61 years old. The scores for his final three films, &quot;Southpaw&quot; (2015), &quot;The 33&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (2016), were all completed and released posthumously.

==Early life and education==
Horner was born on August 14, 1953, in Los Angeles, California, to Jewish immigrant parents. His father, Harry Horner, was born in Holice, Czech Republic, then a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He emigrated to the United States in 1935 and worked as a set designer and art director. His mother, Joan Ruth (née Frankel), was born to a Canadian family. His brother Christopher is a writer and documentary filmmaker.

Horner started playing piano at the age of five. He also played violin. He spent his early years in London, where he attended the Royal College of Music, where he studied with György Ligeti. He returned to America, where he attended Verde Valley School in Sedona, Arizona, and later received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in music from the University of Southern California. After earning a master&#x27;s degree, he started work on his doctorate at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he studied with Paul Chihara, among others. After several scoring assignments with the American Film Institute in the 1970s, he finished teaching a course in music theory at UCLA, then turned to film scoring.

==Career==
Horner&#x27;s first credits as a feature-film composer were for B-movie director and producer Roger Corman. 1979&#x27;s &quot;The Lady in Red&quot;, was followed by 1980&#x27;s &quot;Humanoids from the Deep&quot; and &quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot;. As his work gained notice in Hollywood, Horner was invited to take on larger projects.

Horner&#x27;s big break came in 1982 when he was asked to score &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. It established him as an A-list Hollywood composer. Director Nicholas Meyer quipped that Horner was hired because the studio could no longer afford the first &quot;Trek&quot; movie&#x27;s composer, Jerry Goldsmith; but that by the time Meyer returned to the franchise with &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, the studio could not afford Horner either.

Horner continued writing high-profile film scores in the 1980s, including &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; (1982), &quot;Krull&quot; (1983), &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984), &quot;Commando&quot; (1985), &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985), &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), &quot;Captain EO&quot; (1986), &quot;*batteries not included&quot; (1987), &quot;Willow&quot; (1988), &quot;Glory&quot; and &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; (both 1989). &quot;Cocoon&quot; was the first of his many collaborations with director Ron Howard.

In 1987, Horner&#x27;s original score for &quot;Aliens&quot; brought him his first Academy Award nomination. &quot;Somewhere Out There,&quot; which he co-composed and co-wrote with Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil for &quot;An American Tail&quot;, was also nominated that year for Best Original Song.

Throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, Horner wrote orchestral scores for family films (particularly those produced by Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment), with credits for &quot;An American Tail&quot; (1986); &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988); &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;, &quot;Once Around&quot; and &quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West&quot; (1991); &quot;Sneakers&quot; (1992); &quot;Once Upon a Forest&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re Back! A Dinosaur&#x27;s Story&quot; (1993); &quot;The Pagemaster&quot; (1994); &quot;Casper&quot;, &quot;Jumanji&quot; and &quot;Balto&quot; (1995); &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1998); and &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; (2000).

In 1990, Horner conducted a new fanfare for Universal Pictures which was first used in &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;.

Horner scored six films in 1995, including his commercially successful and critically acclaimed works for &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, both of which received Academy Award nominations.

Horner&#x27;s biggest critical and financial success came in 1997 with his score for James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot;. At the 70th Academy Awards, Horner received the Oscar for Best Original Dramatic Score, and shared the Oscar for Best Original Song with co-writer Will Jennings for &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. The film&#x27;s score and song also won three Grammy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. (Ten years earlier, Horner had vowed never to work with Cameron again, referring to the highly stressful scoring sessions for &quot;Aliens&quot; as &quot;a nightmare.&quot;)

After &quot;Titanic&quot;, Horner continued to compose for major productions, including &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot;, &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zorro&quot;, &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; and &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot;. He also worked on smaller projects such as &quot;Iris&quot;, &quot;Radio&quot; and &quot;Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius&quot;. He received his eighth and ninth Academy Award nominations for &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; (2001) and &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; (2003), but lost on both occasions to composer Howard Shore.

Horner composed the 2006–2011 theme for the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, which was introduced during the debut of anchor Katie Couric on September 5, 2006. He wrote various treatments of the theme, explaining, &quot;One night the show might begin with the Iranians obtaining a nuclear device, and another it might be something about a flower show... The tone needs to match the news.&quot;

Horner collaborated again with James Cameron on his 2009 film &quot;Avatar&quot;, which became the highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing Cameron&#x27;s own &quot;Titanic&quot;. Horner worked exclusively on &quot;Avatar&quot; for over two years. He said, &quot;&quot;Avatar&quot; has been the most difficult film I have worked on, and the biggest job I have undertaken... I work from four in the morning to about ten at night, and that&#x27;s been my way of life since March. That&#x27;s the world I&#x27;m in now, and it makes you feel estranged from everything. I&#x27;ll have to recover from that and get my head out of [it].&quot;

&quot;Avatar&quot; brought Horner his tenth Academy Award nomination, as well as nominations for the Golden Globe Award, British Academy Film Award and Grammy Award, all of which he lost to Michael Giacchino for &quot;Up&quot;.

After &quot;Avatar&quot;, Horner wrote the score for the 2010 version of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, replacing Atli Örvarsson. In 2011, he scored &quot;Cristiada&quot; (also known as &quot;For Greater Glory&quot;), which was released a year later; and &quot;Black Gold&quot;. In 2012 he scored &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, starring Andrew Garfield. In an interview on his website, Horner revealed that he did not return to compose the score for the sequel because he did not like how the movie resulted in comparison to the first movie, calling it &quot;dreadful.&quot; He was replaced by Hans Zimmer. James Horner&#x27;s theme for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; would later be incorporated into the film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;, composed by Michael Giacchino.

In early 2015, after a three-year hiatus, Horner wrote the music for the adventure film &quot;Wolf Totem&quot;, his fourth collaboration with director Jean-Jacques Annaud.

At the time of his death, Horner had scored two films yet to be released:

In July 2015, a month after his death, it was discovered Horner had also written the score for the 2016 remake of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, planning it as a surprise.

Horner&#x27;s scores are also heard in trailers for other films. The climax of &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Countdown&quot;, from his score for &quot;Aliens&quot;, ranks as the 5th most commonly used soundtrack cue in trailers.

Horner also wrote the theme music for the Horsemen P-51 Aerobatic Team, and appears in &quot;The Horsemen Cometh&quot;, a documentary about the team and the P-51 Mustang fighter plane. The theme is heard at the team&#x27;s airshow performances.

===Orchestral work===
&quot;Pas de Deux&quot;, a double concerto for violin, cello and Orchestra with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, was premiered on November 12, 2014, by Mari and Håkon Samuelsen, with the orchestra conducted by Vasily Petrenko. Horner also composed &quot;Collage&quot;, a concerto for four horns, premiered on March 27, 2015, at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Jaime Martín, with soloists David Pyatt, John Ryan, James Thatcher and Richard Watkins. Two early works, &quot;Spectral Shimmers&quot; (1978) and &quot;A Forest Passage&quot; (2000), are to be performed and recorded for the first time in 2021.

== Musical &quot;borrowing&quot; ==
Horner was criticized on many occasions for reusing passages from his earlier compositions and for featuring brief excerpts and reworked themes from classical composers. For example, his scores from &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; and &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; include excerpts from Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, respectively; the action ostinato from &quot;Aliens&quot; is originally from &quot;Wolfen&quot;, and the film&#x27;s main title is almost identical to Aram Khachaturian&#x27;s &quot;Gayane&quot; Ballet Suite (Adagio) (already used in an outer-space context in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;) and would be used again within the score of &quot;Patriot Games&quot; and &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;; the heroic theme from &quot;Willow&quot; is based on that of Robert Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Rhenish&quot; Symphony; &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; includes cues from the &quot;Saturday Night Waltz&quot; portion of Aaron Copland&#x27;s ballet &quot;Rodeo&quot; and Copland&#x27;s score from &quot;Our Town&quot;; Horner blended part of an early theme from the third movement of Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony no. 5 into an action scene in &quot;Patriot Games&quot;; musical motifs from &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; are recycled into &quot;Commando&quot;, &quot;Red Heat&quot;, and &quot;Another 48 Hrs.&quot;; and the climactic battle scene in &quot;Glory&quot; includes excerpts from Wagner and Orff. Some critics felt these propensities made Horner&#x27;s compositions inauthentic or unoriginal. In a 1997 issue of &quot;Film Score Monthly,&quot; an editorial review of &quot;Titanic&quot; said Horner was &quot;skilled in the adaptation of existing music into films with just enough variation to avoid legal troubles&quot;.

Several critics have noted stark similarities between Braveheart&#x27;s &quot;Main Theme&quot; and an earlier theme song, Kaoru Wada&#x27;s &quot;Pai Longing&quot; from the 1991 Japanese anime series &quot;3×3 Eyes&quot;.

On at least one occasion, Horner&#x27;s musical &quot;borrowing&quot; almost led to litigation. Horner&#x27;s main title for &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; (1989) incorporates cues from the score by Nino Rota from Federico Fellini&#x27;s film &quot;Amarcord&quot; (1973) and Raymond Scott&#x27;s piece &quot;Powerhouse B&quot; (1937), the latter often referenced in Carl Stalling&#x27;s Warner Bros. cartoon scores. Scott&#x27;s piece was used without payment or credit, leading his estate to threaten legal action against Disney. Disney paid an undisclosed sum in an out-of-court settlement and changed the film&#x27;s cue sheets to credit Scott.

==Personal life==
Horner was also a qualified private pilot and owned several small airplanes. His studio was filled with small automatons and objects which he purchased and collected over time. In a documentary produced after his death, Horner&#x27;s wife Sara stated that he described himself as having Asperger syndrome; according to Sara &quot;He would say himself, and did at the end of his life, that he had Asperger&#x27;s, and he definitely had a different kind of neurological wiring.&quot;

==Death==

Horner died on June 22, 2015, when his turboprop aircraft, a Short Tucano with registration number N206PZ, crashed into the Los Padres National Forest near Ventucopa, California. Horner was the only occupant of the aircraft when it took off after fueling at Camarillo Airport. Three days later, on June 25, the Ventura County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office ruled the crash an accident. He was survived by his wife, Sara Elizabeth Horner (née Nelson), and two daughters.

Post-accident investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed that the leading cause of the accident was Horner&#x27;s inability to maintain clearance from terrain during low-level airwork. During the flight, Horner contacted the Southern California Air Route Traffic Control Center, from whom he received advisories while flying over the Chumash Wilderness area. The NTSB interviewed two witnesses of the flight, who were in their homes when Horner flew over them; one said that the plane was flying at between . FAA radar data showed that the plane had made multiple low-altitude turns and performed rapid altitude change maneuvers, flying low through Quatal Canyon and skimming mountain ridgelines by less than .

In addition to Horner&#x27;s failing to maintain clearance, the NTSB determined there were other key factors that led to the accident. Foremost among these was Horner&#x27;s use of prescription medications for pain relief and headaches. Toxicology testing found butalbital, codeine and ethanol in Horner&#x27;s body (although the ethanol may have been produced by microbial activity after his death).

===Tributes===
Contemporaries and collaborators around the world paid their respects to Horner, including composers Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Paul Williams and Alan Menken, and directors Ron Howard and James Cameron. Horner was reported to have been committed to the &quot;Avatar&quot; franchise; Cameron said &quot;There&#x27;s so much music he could have done. We were looking forward to our next gig.&quot; Horner&#x27;s assistant, Sylvia Patrycja, wrote on her Facebook page, &quot;We have lost an amazing person with a huge heart and unbelievable talent [who] died doing what he loved.&quot; Many celebrities, including Russell Crowe, Diane Warren and Celine Dion, also gave their condolences. Dion, who sang &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, one of Horner&#x27;s most popular compositions, which is considered Dion&#x27;s signature song, wrote on her website that she and husband René Angélil were &quot;shaken by the tragic death&quot; of their friend and &quot;will always remember his kindness and great talent that changed [her] career&quot;. Leona Lewis, who recorded Horner&#x27;s &quot;I See You&quot; for &quot;Avatar&quot;, said working with him &quot;was one of the biggest moments of my life.&quot; The final films for which he composed the score, &quot;Southpaw&quot;, &quot;The 33&quot; and &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, were all dedicated to his memory, as was the film &quot;Hacksaw Ridge&quot;. &quot;&quot;, which Horner was set to work on before he died, was also dedicated to his memory (as well as actor Bill Paxton, who died in 2017 and worked with Horner and Cameron on &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;).

==Legacy==
Horner&#x27;s extensive papers and archives are preserved and available for researchers at the UCLA Charles E. Young Research Library Special Collections and Archives. The film, &quot;The World of James Horner – Hollywood in Vienna&quot; (2013), directed by Sandra Tomek was dedicated to Horner.

==Awards and nominations==
Horner won two Academy Awards, for Best Original Dramatic Score (&quot;Titanic&quot;) and Best Original Song (&quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;) in 1998, and was nominated for an additional eight Oscars. He also won two Golden Globe Awards, three Satellite Awards, three Saturn Awards, six Grammys, and was nominated for three British Academy Film Awards.

In October 2013, Horner received the Max Steiner Award at the Hollywood in Vienna Gala, an award given for extraordinary achievement in the field of film music.

===AFI===
In 2005, the American Film Institute unveiled their list of the top twenty-five American film scores. Five of Horner&#x27;s scores were among 250 nominees, making him the most nominated composer to &quot;not&quot; make the top twenty-five.

<text>The Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (, also known as the Bi and Bi Commission and the Laurendeau-Dunton Commission) was a Canadian royal commission established on 19 July 1963, by the government of Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson to &quot;inquire into and report upon the existing state of bilingualism and biculturalism in Canada and to recommend what steps should be taken to develop the Canadian Confederation on the basis of an equal partnership between the two founding races, taking into account the contribution made by the other ethnic groups to the cultural enrichment of Canada and the measures that should be taken to safeguard that contribution&quot;.

The Commission was jointly chaired by André Laurendeau, publisher of &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, and Davidson Dunton, president of Carleton University. As a result, it was sometimes known as the Laurendeau-Dunton commission.

Ten commissioners representing each of the provinces were also included in the commission as areas such as education were provincial responsibilities.

==Background==
Throughout the Quiet Revolution, modern Quebec nationalism rose as the federation-wide French Canadian nationalism became less and less supported by the younger Francophone generations of this province. The failure of Canada to establish the equality of the English and French languages within governmental institutions is one of main reasons for the rise of the Quebec secessionist movement.

==Recommendations==
The Commission recommended sweeping changes when its final report was published, in five parts, 1967-1970, after a report of preliminary findings, February 1965. Among other things, it reported that Francophones were underrepresented in the nation&#x27;s political and business communities. 1961 statistics of the salaries of Quebec men based on ethnic origin revealed that French Canadian incomes lagged behind all other ethnic groups, with the exception of Italian Canadians and aboriginal Canadians.

- The recommendations included the following:

* That bilingual districts be created in regions of Canada where members of the minority community, either French or English, made up 10% or more of the local population.
* That parents be able to have their children attend schools in the language of their choice in regions where there is sufficient demand.
* That Ottawa become a bilingual city.
* That English and French be declared official languages of Canada.

==Cultural legacy==
While in some circles the Commission&#x27;s legacy is controversial, others view it as a success. The under representation of French-Canadians in positions of power is less of a problem and French-Canadians have access to government services in their own language.

==Political response==
Incoming Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau included the Commission&#x27;s recommendations among his priorities. Prime Minister Pearson&#x27;s policy statement on bilingualism was strengthened by the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot;, 1969, making Canada an officially bilingual nation. The provinces were also recommended to make reforms, and many did. Canada&#x27;s education system was overhauled and school children across the country were made to learn both languages. Quebec later legislated French as its official language and limited English schooling to qualified families. French education in western provinces remained limited by provincial regulation as well.

The Commission and its recommendations were supported by both the Progressive Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party, but the Tories did have concerns with the costly implementation of the reforms. Regional parties like the Social Credit Party, the Confederation of Regions Party and the Reform Party later objected strongly to these changes.

In 1971, the Trudeau government departed from the Commission&#x27;s findings. While Canada remained a bilingual nation, it pursued a policy of multiculturalism rather than biculturalism.

===Constitutional incorporation===
In the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, Trudeau ensured that many of the Commission&#x27;s recommendations were permanently included in the Constitution of Canada, as sections 16 through section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms included several language rights.

<doc id="466684" wikidata="Q3518834" url="?curid=466684" title="Territorial Force">
<text>The Territorial Force was a part-time volunteer component of the British Army, created in 1908 to augment British land forces without resorting to conscription. The new organisation consolidated the 19th-century Volunteer Force and yeomanry into a unified auxiliary, commanded by the War Office and administered by local county territorial associations. The Territorial Force was designed to reinforce the regular army in expeditionary operations abroad, but because of political opposition it was assigned to home defence. Members were liable for service anywhere in the UK and could not be compelled to serve overseas. In the first two months of the First World War, territorials volunteered for foreign service in significant numbers, allowing territorial units to be deployed abroad. They saw their first action on the Western Front during the initial German offensive of 1914, and the force filled the gap between the near destruction of the regular army that year and the arrival of the New Army in 1915. Territorial units were deployed to Gallipoli in 1915 and, following the failure of that campaign, provided the bulk of the British contribution to allied forces in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. By the war&#x27;s end, the Territorial Force had fielded twenty-three infantry divisions and two mounted divisions on foreign soil. It was demobilised after the war and reconstituted in 1921 as the Territorial Army.

The force experienced problems throughout its existence. On establishment, fewer than 40 per cent of the men in the previous auxiliary institutions transferred into it, and it was consistently under strength until the outbreak of the First World War. It was not considered to be an effective military force by the regular army and was denigrated by the proponents of conscription. Lord Kitchener chose to concentrate the Territorial Force on home defence and raise the New Army to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France, a decision which disappointed the territorials. The need to replace heavy losses suffered by the BEF before the New Army was ready forced Kitchener to deploy territorial units overseas, compromising the force&#x27;s ability to defend the homeland. To replace foreign-service units, the Territorial Force was doubled in size by creating a second line which mirrored the organisation of the original, first-line units. Second-line units assumed responsibility for home defence and provided replacement drafts to the first line. The second line competed with the New Army for limited resources and was poorly equipped and armed. The provision of replacements to the first line compromised the second line&#x27;s home defence capabilities until a third line was raised to take over responsibility for territorial recruitment and training. The second line&#x27;s duties were further complicated by the expectation, later confirmed, that it too would be deployed overseas.

Territorial units were initially deployed overseas to free up regular units from non-combat duties. On the Western Front, individual battalions were attached to regular army formations and sent into action, and the territorials were credited with playing a key role in stopping the German offensive. The first complete territorial division to be deployed to a combat zone arrived in France in March 1915. Territorial divisions began participating in offensive operations on the Western Front from June 1915 and at Gallipoli later that year. Because of the way it was constituted and recruited, the Territorial Force possessed an identity that was distinct from the regular army and the New Army. This became increasingly diluted as heavy casualties were replaced with conscripted recruits following the introduction of compulsory service in early 1916. The Territorial Force was further eroded as a separate institution when county territorial associations were relieved of most of their administrative responsibilities. By the war&#x27;s end, there was little to distinguish between regular, territorial and New Army formations.

==Background==
The British Army of the late 19th century was a small, professional organisation designed to garrison the empire and maintain order at home, with no capacity to provide an expeditionary force in a major war. It was augmented in its home duties by three part-time volunteer institutions, the militia, the Volunteer Force and the yeomanry. Battalions of the militia and Volunteer Force had been linked with regular army regiments since 1872, and the militia was often used as a source of recruitment into the regular army. The terms of service for all three auxiliaries made service overseas voluntary. The Second Boer War exposed weaknesses in the ability of the regular army to counter guerrilla warfare which required additional manpower to overcome. The only reinforcements available were the auxiliaries – nearly 46,000 militiamen served in South Africa and another 74,000 were enlisted into the regular army; some 20,000 men of the Volunteer Force volunteered for active service in South Africa; and the yeomanry provided the nucleus of the separate Imperial Yeomanry for which over 34,000 volunteered.

The war placed a significant strain on the regular forces. Against a background of invasion scares in the press, George Wyndham, Under-Secretary of State for War, conceded in Parliament in February 1900 that instead of augmenting the regular army&#x27;s defence of the British coast, the auxiliary forces were the main defence. The questionable performance of the volunteers, caused by poor standards of efficiency and training, led to doubts in both government and the regular army about the auxiliary&#x27;s ability to meet such a challenge. The war also exposed the difficulty in relying on auxiliary forces which were not liable for service overseas as a source of reinforcements for the regular army in times of crisis. In 1903, the director of general mobilisation and military intelligence reported an excess of home defence forces which could not be relied upon to expand the army in foreign campaigns. The utility of such forces was brought further into question by British military planning; the Royal Navy formed the primary defence against invasion, and studies in 1903 and 1908 concluded that the threat of invasion was negligible, despite popular perceptions to the contrary.

==Reform efforts==

The first reform efforts were undertaken in 1901 by William St John Brodrick, Secretary of State for War. They were designed to improve the training of the auxiliary forces and transform the yeomanry from cavalry to mounted infantry. Brodrick&#x27;s efforts were met with opposition from auxiliary interests in the government, and the yeomanry in particular proved resistant to change. A royal commission on auxiliary forces concluded in 1904 that the volunteer organisations were not fit to defend the country unaided and that the only effective solution would be to introduce conscription. This option, regarded as political suicide by all parties, was immediately rejected. Brodrick&#x27;s successor, H. O. Arnold-Forster, also failed to overcome opposition to his reform efforts. In December 1905, a Liberal government took office, bringing in Richard Haldane as the Secretary of State for War. His vision was for a nation that could be mobilised for war without resorting to conscription – a &quot;real national army, formed by the people&quot;. His solution was the Territorial Force, financed, trained and commanded centrally by the War Office and raised, supplied and administered by local county territorial associations.

Haldane was able to overcome opposition and pass the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 which created the force, though not without compromise. His plan to give civic, business and trade union leaders a major role in running the county territorial associations was significantly reduced in the face of opposition to civilian encroachment in military affairs. Instead, the associations were chaired by Lord Lieutenants and run by traditional county military elites. Militia representatives refused to accept Haldane&#x27;s plans to allocate a proportion of the militia as a reserve for the regular army and incorporate the remainder into the Territorial Force. After three attempts to persuade them, Haldane abolished the militia and created the Special Reserve.

Crucially, Haldane&#x27;s efforts were based on the premise that home defence rested with the navy and that the imperative for army reform was to provide an expeditionary capability. His reorganisation of the regular army created a six-division Expeditionary Force, and his plan was for the Territorial Force to reinforce it after six months of training following mobilisation. Representatives of the existing auxiliary forces and elements within the Liberal party opposed any foreign service obligation. To ensure their support, Haldane declared the Territorial Force&#x27;s purpose to be home defence when he introduced his reforms in Parliament, despite having stressed an overseas role eight days previously. The last-minute change caused significant difficulties for the force throughout its existence.

==Formation==

The Territorial Force was established on 1 April 1908 by the amalgamation of the Volunteer Force and the yeomanry. The Volunteer Force battalions became the infantry component of the Territorial Force and were more closely integrated into regular army regimental establishments they had previously been linked to; for example, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Volunteer Battalions of the regular army&#x27;s Gloucestershire Regiment became the regiment&#x27;s 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions (Territorial Force). The infantry was organised into 14 territorial divisions, each of three brigades. The yeomanry regiments became the mounted component of the Territorial Force, organised into 14 mounted brigades. Brigades and divisions were equipped with integral supporting arms along regular army lines, comprising territorial units of artillery (totalling 182 horse and field batteries), engineers and signals, along with supply, medical and veterinary services. Each territorial unit was assigned a specific role either in coastal defence, supplementing 81 territorial companies of the Royal Garrison Artillery manning fixed defences, or as part of the mobile Central Force. Training was managed by a permanent staff of regular army personnel attached to territorial units.

Recruits to the Territorial Force had to be aged between 17 and 35. They enlisted for a four-year term which could be extended by an obligatory year in times of crisis. Members could terminate their enlistment on three months&#x27; notice and payment of a fine. Recruits were required to attend a minimum of 40 drill periods in their first year and 20 per year thereafter. All members were required to attend between eight and fifteen days of annual camp. The force was liable to serve anywhere in the UK. Members were not required to serve overseas but could volunteer to do so. Haldane, who still regarded the force&#x27;s primary function to be the expansion of the Expeditionary Force, hoped that up to a quarter of all territorials would volunteer on mobilisation. The Imperial Service Obligation was introduced in 1910 to allow territorials to volunteer in advance. It was illegal to amalgamate or disband territorial units or transfer members between them.

===Reception===
The reforms were not received well by the auxiliaries. The exclusion of the militia rendered Haldane&#x27;s target of just over 314,000 officers and men for the Territorial Force unattainable. The new terms of service imposed an increased commitment on members compared to that demanded by the previous auxiliary institutions. By 1 June 1908, the force had attracted less than 145,000 recruits. Despite considerable efforts to promote the new organisation to the former auxiliary institutions, less than 40 per cent of all existing auxiliaries transferred into it.

The county territorial associations emphasised pride in a local territorial identity in their efforts to recruit new members, and used imagery of local scenes under attack to encourage enlistment. In general, the force attracted recruits from the working class, though they were mainly artisans rather than the unskilled labourers who filled the ranks of the regular army. In some units, middle and working classes served together. Units which recruited from the more affluent urban centres contained a significant proportion of well-educated white-collar workers. Territorial officers were predominantly middle class, meaning that in some units there was little to separate officers from other ranks in terms of social status.
Territorial officers were regarded as social inferiors by the regular army&#x27;s more privileged officer corps. The territorials&#x27; relatively narrow social spectrum resulted in a less formal system of self-discipline than the rigid, hierarchical discipline of the regular army, feeding a professional prejudice against the amateur auxiliary. The regular army had no more faith in the territorials&#x27; abilities than it had in those of the force&#x27;s predecessors. Territorial standards of training and musketry were suspect, and the reputation of the territorial artillery was so poor that there were calls for it to be disbanded. Regular officers, fearing for their career prospects, often resisted postings as territorial adjutants. The Army Council predicted that, even after six months of intensive training on mobilisation, the force would not reach a standard at which two territorial divisions could be considered the equal of one regular division as planned. In 1908 and 1914, it was decided that two of the army&#x27;s six expeditionary divisions should be retained in the UK for home defence, so ineffective was the Territorial Force perceived to be in the role to which it had been assigned.

==Conscription debate and pre-war problems==
In 1910, Lord Esher, pro-conscription chairman of the London County Territorial Association, wrote in the &quot;National Review&quot; that the country would have to choose between an under-strength voluntary auxiliary and compulsory service. In his opinion, the Territorial Force was the last chance for the volunteer tradition, and its failure would pave the way for conscription. Advocacy for compulsory service was led by the National Service League (NSL), which regarded reliance on a naval defence against invasion as complacent and a strong home army as essential. A bill sponsored by the NSL in 1909 proposed using the Territorial Force as the framework for a conscripted home army. When that failed, the league became increasingly antagonistic towards the auxiliary. The force was denigrated for its excessive youth, inefficiency and consistently low numbers, and ridiculed in the popular press as the &quot;Territorial Farce&quot;. The NSL&#x27;s president – the former Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, Lord Roberts – enlisted the support of serving officers in a campaign against it, and in 1913 the Army Council declared its support for conscription. Even prominent members of the force itself favoured compulsory service, and by April 1913 ten county territorial associations had expressed support for it.

The relationship between the county territorial associations and the War Office was often acrimonious. The associations frequently complained about excessive bureaucracy and inadequate finance. The military authorities begrudged the money that could have been spent on the regular army being wasted on what they perceived as an inefficient, amateur auxiliary. Efforts to provide adequate facilities, for example, were undermined by slow responses from the War Office which, when finally forthcoming, often rejected the associations&#x27; plans outright or refused to allocate the full financing requested. In 1909, the Gloucestershire association complained that &quot;most of our association are businessmen and are unable to understand why it takes ten weeks and upwards to reply&quot; after waiting for a response to its proposed purchase of a site for a field ambulance unit. Somerset lost three sites for a proposed new drill hall because the War Office took so long to approve plans, and Essex had to wait five years before it received approval for the construction of new rifle ranges. Good facilities were regarded by the associations as important for efficiency, unit &quot;esprit de corps&quot; and recruitment, and the authorities&#x27; parsimony and apparent obstruction were seen as undermining these.

The force failed to retain large numbers of men after their initial enlistment expired, and it consistently fell short of its established strength. It reached a peak of 268,000 men in 1909 when invasion scares prompted a surge in recruitment, but by 1913 numbers had declined to less than 246,000, and the officer corps was nearly 20 per cent under-subscribed. In 1910, a third of the force had not completed the minimum level of musketry training. Only 155,000 territorials completed the full 15-day annual camp in 1912, and around 6,000 did not attend at all. In 1909, some 37 per cent of the rank and file were under 20 years old; in the opinion of the inspector-general of the Home Forces, this proportion rendered the force too immature to be effective. In 1913, approximately 40,000 territorials were under 19 years old, the minimum age at which they could volunteer for service overseas. Barely seven per cent of the force had accepted the Imperial Service Obligation, seriously compromising its viability as a reinforcement for the Expeditionary Force. Because the military authorities regarded the Territorial Force as weak and saw no value in an auxiliary that was not liable for foreign service, they prioritised expenditure on the regular army, leaving the force armed with obsolete weapons.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War, Lord Kitchener by-passed the Territorial Force and, with the approval of the military authorities, raised instead the New Army of volunteers to expand the regular army. His decision was based not only on professional prejudice – he regarded the territorials as a joke, led by &quot;middle-aged professional men who were allowed to put on uniform and play at soldiers&quot; – but also on an appreciation of the constraints imposed by the force&#x27;s constitution. He feared that the county territorial associations would be unable to cope with the task of recruiting and training large numbers. He also believed that because so few territorials had thus far volunteered for foreign service, the Territorial Force was better suited for home defence than as a means of expanding the army overseas.

===Mobilisation and training===
At the end of July, territorial Special Service Sections began patrolling the east coast. On the day before the declaration of war, the 1st London Brigade was dispersed by platoons to protect the rail network between London and Southampton. The remainder of the Territorial Force was mobilised on the evening of 4 August 1914, and war stations were quickly occupied by those units with bases located nearby. By 6 August, for example, units of the Wessex Division were concentrated at Plymouth while those of the Northumbrian Division took up positions in the east coast defences, and the following day elements of the Welsh Division were gathered in the area of Pembroke Dock. Some formations assembled close to their bases before moving on to their war stations; the Highland Division, for example, gathered at various locations north of Edinburgh before proceeding to Bedford, north of London. Defence duties resulted in some divisions being dispersed; a brigade of the West Riding Division, for example, was deployed to watch the east coast while the rest of the division guarded railways and munitions factories inland, and the brigades of the East Anglian Division were widely scattered about East Anglia.

On 13 August 1914, Kitchener signalled a willingness to deploy overseas those territorial units in which 80 per cent of the men (reduced to 60 per cent at the end of the month) had accepted the Imperial Service Obligation. Despite the low uptake before the war, 72 per cent of the rank and file volunteered for foreign service by the end of September. The first full territorial divisions to be deployed overseas were used to free up imperial garrisons. The East Lancashire Division was sent to Egypt in September, and three territorial divisions had been deployed to India by January 1915. Territorial battalions released regular troops stationed at Aden, Cyprus, Gibraltar and Malta. Five regular army divisions were created from the troops released by the territorials&#x27; deployments. The extent to which territorials accepted the obligation varied considerably between battalions; some registered 90 per cent or more acceptance, others less than 50 per cent. The difficulties were not restricted to the rank and file, and many battalions sailed for foreign service with officers who had been newly promoted or recruited to replace those who had chosen to remain at home.
The territorials faced difficulties as they trained up to operational standard. Some artillery units did not get an opportunity to practise with live ammunition until January 1915. Rifle practice suffered due to lack of rifles, practice ammunition and ranges on which to use them. Because there was insufficient transport, a motley collection of carts, private vehicles and lorries were pressed into service. The animals used to pull the non-motorised transport or mount the yeomanry ranged in pedigree from half-blind pit ponies to show horses. The Territorial Force competed with the New Army for recruits, and the War Office prioritised the latter for training and equipment. Many of the regular army staff posted to territorial units were recalled to their parent regiments, and those professionals that still remained were transferred to territorial reserve units in January 1915. Training proved difficult for formations that were widely dispersed as part of their defence duties, and was complicated for all by the need to reorganise the territorial battalions&#x27; outdated eight-company structure to the army&#x27;s standard four-company battalion.

====Second line====
On 15 August, county territorial associations began raising second-line units to replace those scheduled for foreign service. The ranks of the second line were filled by those territorials who could not or did not accept the Imperial Service Obligation. In November, associations started raising third-line units to take over from the second-line units the responsibility for providing replacement drafts to territorial combat units. Territorial battalions were numbered according to line so that, for example, the three lines of the 6th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, became the 1/6th, 2/6th and 3/6th Battalions. In May 1915, territorial divisions were numbered in order of their deployment overseas; the East Lancashire Division, for example, became the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division.

Second-line units immediately assumed that the third line would take over their home-based duties, in the belief that second-line divisions would be deployed overseas. Many second-line battalions refused to take recruits who had not accepted the Imperial Service Obligation, a practice that was not officially sanctioned until March 1915 when the option to enlist only for home service was abolished. The deployment of second-line units overseas was officially endorsed in mid 1915. Until the third line was ready, the conflicting demands to supply drafts, defend the homeland and prepare for deployment caused problems for the second line. In May 1915, Kitchener informed the War Cabinet that the second line was so denuded of trained men as to render it unreliable for home defence. Only in 1916 could the War Office promise that the second line would no longer be trawled for replacements to be sent to the first line. By this time, second-line battalion establishments had been reduced to 400 men, less than half the number normally serving in an infantry battalion at full strength. It took on average 27 months to prepare a second-line formation for active service, compared to eight months for the first line, and the second line often lacked sufficient weapons and ammunition. The desire among the second-line commanders to maintain a level of training and efficiency in readiness for their own deployment led to friction with their first-line counterparts, who accused the second line of holding back the best men and sending sub-standard replacements to the first line.

===Western Front===

When the regular army suffered high attrition during the opening battles in France, Kitchener came under pressure to make up the losses. With the New Army not yet ready, he was forced to fall back on the territorials. Despite the preference of General Ian Hamilton, commander-in-chief of the Home Forces, for the Territorial Force to be deployed to the Western Front in complete brigades and divisions, it was deployed piecemeal. Because of the pressing need for troops, individual battalions were sent as soon as they reached a degree of efficiency and attached to regular brigades. There was little logic in the choice of units deployed. Some that had been positively assessed remained at home while less well prepared units were deployed, often without enough equipment and only after being hastily brought up to strength. The first territorial unit to arrive was the 1/14th Battalion (London Scottish), London Regiment, in September 1914. By December, twenty-two infantry battalions, seven yeomanry regiments, and one medical and three engineer units had been sent.

Territorial battalions were initially allocated to line-of-communication duties for up to three weeks before being assigned to regular army brigades. From February 1915, with 48 infantry battalions in-country, they were sent directly to their host divisions. On arrival at the front, the territorials would spend several days in further training behind the lines before undergoing a period of trench acclimatisation. When the battalion was considered proficient, or when the pressure to relieve a regular unit became too severe, the territorials were allocated their own sector of the front. The time between arriving at brigade and taking over the trenches varied from between six days to one month.

====Filling the gap====

The territorials were thrown into the defensive battles of the initial German offensive during the Race to the Sea. Among the first to see action was the London Scottish, which suffered 640 casualties on 31 October 1914 during the Battle of Messines. It was in action again during the First Battle of Ypres in November, and was praised as a &quot;glorious lead and example&quot; to the rest of the Territorial Force by Field Marshal Sir John French, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). As the territorials completed their training and the threat of invasion receded, complete divisions were deployed to combat theatres. The first to depart was the 46th (North Midland) Division, which arrived on the Western Front in March 1915. By July, all 14 first-line divisions had been deployed overseas.

The Northumberland Brigade of the Northumbrian Division became the first territorial formation larger than a battalion to fight under its own command when it participated in an abortive counter-attack on 26 April 1915 during the Second Battle of Ypres. It suffered 1,954 casualties and earned a personal congratulation from French. The division had deployed only three days earlier; the rest of its units were attached piecemeal to other formations and immediately thrown into the desperate fighting, earning further praise from French for their tenacity and determination. Several other territorial battalions attached to regular army formations fought with distinction in the defence of Ypres, at the cost of heavy casualties. The three battalions of the Monmouthshire Regiment were temporarily amalgamated into a single composite battalion, as were three battalions of the London Regiment. Battlefield amalgamations were a military necessity which threatened the legal protections on territorial unit integrity.

Although the territorials were proving their worth in defensive operations, the commanders of the regular formations to which they were attached still did not trust their abilities. The regulars regarded the primary function of the territorials to be the release of regular battalions for offensive operations. The territorials were employed in the construction and maintenance of trenches, and generally performed only supporting actions in the attacks at Neuve Chapelle and Aubers Ridge in early 1915. An exception was the 1/13th Battalion (Kensington), London Regiment. During the Battle of Aubers Ridge, the Kensingtons became the first territorial battalion to be deployed in the first wave of a major assault, and was the only battalion to achieve its objective on the day. But the Territorial Force had filled the gaps created in the regular army by the German offensive of 1914, and French wrote that it would have been impossible to halt the German advance without it.

====First divisional operations====
The 51st (Highland) Division participated in an attack on 15 June 1915 in the Second Action of Givenchy, part of the Second Battle of Artois. The division had lost several of its original battalions to piecemeal deployment and had been brought up to strength only a month before it arrived in France, largely by the attachment of a brigade from the 55th (West Lancashire) Division. It was the first experience in assault for the two battalions that spearheaded the division&#x27;s attack. They succeeded in reaching the German second line of defences, but when the regular forces on their right did not the territorials were forced to retire with heavy losses. A professionally planned and executed assault by the 47th (1/2nd London) Division was one of the few successes in the Battle of Loos on 25 September, but the 46th (North Midland) Division suffered 3,643 casualties in a failed assault against the Hohenzollern Redoubt on 13 October. To Lieutenant-General Sir Douglas Haig, commander of the First Army, the 46th Division&#x27;s failure demonstrated that &quot;some territorial units still need training and discipline&quot;.
By the summer of 1915, six complete territorial divisions had been deployed to France. Many of the 52 territorial units still attached to regular army formations were returned to their own parent commands. This allowed the professionals to remove from their formations an element made awkward by its specific terms of service. The regulars found the territorials to be slow to move and recuperate, and better in static defence than attack. Nevertheless, the reshuffle indicated that the Territorial Force had exceeded the expectations of the military authorities, and the territorials&#x27; time with the regulars generally resulted in a strong camaraderie and mutual respect between the two. French reported in February 1915 the praise of his commanders for their territorials, who were &quot;fast approaching, if they had not already reached, the standards of efficiency of the regular infantry&quot;.

====Battle of the Somme====
There were eight first-line territorial divisions on the Western Front at the start of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916. Two of them, the 46th (North Midland) Division and the 56th (1/1st London) Division, went into action on the first day in a disastrous attack on the Gommecourt Salient, a diversionary operation conducted by the Third Army. Two more territorial divisions, the 48th (South Midland) and the 49th (West Riding), were among the initial 25 divisions of the Fourth Army, which bore the brunt of the fighting during the four and a half months of the Somme offensive. The 49th Division was committed piecemeal on the first day to the fighting around the Schwaben Redoubt, and two battalions of the 48th Division were attached to the 4th Division and participated in the first day&#x27;s fighting. The 48th Division itself went into action on 16 July, and by the end of September the remaining four territorial divisions – the 47th (1/2nd London), 50th (Northumbrian), 51st (Highland) and 55th (West Lancashire) – had relieved battle-weary units and gone into action.
Although the 46th Division&#x27;s poor performance at Gommecourt cemented a perception that it was a failed unit and the 49th Division&#x27;s standing was little better, the territorials generally emerged from the Somme with enhanced reputations. This was echoed by Brigadier-General C. B. Prowse, a brigade commander in the 4th Division, who commented, &quot;I did not before think much of the territorials, but by God they can fight.&quot; The Battle of the Somme marked the high point of the Territorial Force as a recognisable entity distinct from the regular and New Army forces. It suffered some 84,000 casualties during the offensive, and the indiscriminate replacement of these with recruits who had been conscripted into the army rather than volunteering specifically for the Territorial Force marked the beginning of the end for the territorial identity.

====Second-line deployment====
Fourteen second-line divisions were formed during the war, eight of which were deployed overseas. The first to fight in a major battle was the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division. Its constituent units were raised in September and October 1914, and their training was indicative of the difficulties faced by the second line in general. New recruits paraded without uniforms until October and lived at home until the division assembled in January 1915. The infantry was equipped with old Japanese Arisaka rifles, antique Maxim machine-guns and dummy Lewis guns constructed from wood. The divisional artillery, having initially drilled with cart-mounted logs, was equipped first with obsolete French 90 mm cannons, then with outdated 15-pounder guns and 5-inch howitzers handed down from the first line. The division was not issued with modern weapons until it began intensive training in March 1916, in preparation for its deployment to France at the end of May. Battalion strengths fluctuated throughout training as men were drafted to first-line units. The division was still only at two-thirds strength when it attacked at the Battle of Fromelles in July 1916 alongside the Australian 5th Division. The heavy casualties suffered by the Australians were blamed on the failure of the territorials&#x27; assaulting battalions to take a key position.

===Gallipoli===

By August 1915, four territorial infantry divisions and a yeomanry mounted division, deployed without its horses as infantry, had reinforced British Empire forces engaged in the Gallipoli Campaign. Their landings were chaotic; the 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade, for example, landed nearly a week before the other two brigades of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. The infantry were rushed into battle without any opportunity to acclimatise, and the 54th (East Anglian) Division did not receive any formal instruction about the nature of the campaign for the first four weeks of its participation in it. Some battalions of the 53rd (Welsh) Division were second-line units and had still been supplying replacement drafts to first-line units, and the division was given only two weeks notice that it was to go to Gallipoli.

The 42nd Division impressed the regulars with its spirit in the Third Battle of Krithia on 4 June. The 155th (South Scottish) Brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division assaulted with such determination in July that it overran its objective and came under fire from French allies. The 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade suffered over 50 per cent casualties in the Battle of Gully Ravine on 28 June, and a battalion of the 54th Division was slaughtered when it advanced too far during an attack on 12 August. The same month, the yeomen of the 2nd Mounted Division suffered 30 per cent casualties during the Battle of Scimitar Hill, and had to be relieved by six dismounted yeomanry brigades which landed in October.

The campaign ended in withdrawal in January 1916. Although Hamilton, appointed to command the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force in March 1915, praised the courage of the territorials, he criticised the performance of the 53rd and 54th Divisions. His comments failed to recognise the difficulties the two divisions had faced with the loss of many of their trained men transferred to other units before their arrival at Gallipoli. Lieutenant-Colonel E. C. Da Costa, GSO1 of the 54th Division, refuted accusations by Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Stopford, commander of IX Corps, that the division lacked attacking spirit and was badly led. Da Costa claimed that its poor performance was entirely due to the way it had been &quot;chucked ashore&quot; and thrown into a poorly coordinated and ill-defined attack.

===Egypt, Sinai and Palestine===

Following a successful British defence of the Suez Canal, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) was formed in March 1916 and went over to the offensive against German and Ottoman forces in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The EEF comprised forces from Britain, Australia, New Zealand and India, and the British contribution was predominantly territorial. Most of the infantry was provided by the four territorial divisions that had fought at Gallipoli. When the 42nd Division was transferred to France in March 1917, it was replaced in July by the second-line 60th (2/2nd London) Division. The latter, having already fought during the Battle of Doiran in Salonika, played a key role in the capture of Jerusalem on 9 December.

The yeomanry provided 18 dismounted regiments which fought as infantry and, in 1917, were formed into the 74th (Yeomanry) Division. This division was transferred to France in 1918 along with the 52nd (Lowland) Division. Five brigades of yeomanry fought in the mounted role, and in 1917 three of them were formed into the Yeomanry Mounted Division. The yeomanry mounted some of the last cavalry charges ever made by British forces; the Charge at Huj on 8 November 1917 by the 1/1st Warwickshire Yeomanry and 1/1st Queen&#x27;s Own Worcestershire Hussars, followed five days later with a charge by the 1/1st Royal Bucks Hussars in the Battle of Mughar Ridge. By the end of a campaign in which the EEF had advanced across the Sinai, through Palestine, and into Syria, territorial casualties numbered over 32,000 – 3,000 more than those suffered by British regular, Australian, New Zealand and Indian forces combined.

===Late war===

The much maligned 46th (North Midland) Division redeemed itself in 1918 in a hazardous attack during the Battle of St Quentin Canal. The operation was successfully spearheaded by the 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade, which included two battalions that were almost disbanded because of their alleged poor performance at Gommecourt two years earlier. The seven untested second-line divisions saw their first actions in 1917. They generally suffered, undeservedly, from poor reputations, although the 58th (2/1st London) and 62nd (2nd West Riding) Divisions were well regarded by the war&#x27;s end. The 51st (Highland) Division, whose men labelled themselves as &quot;duds&quot; after a slow start, and the two London first-line divisions were among the best in the BEF by 1918. A reputation for dependability resulted in the 48th (South Midland) Division being transferred to Italy to relieve the regular 7th Infantry Division in March 1918. Several territorial divisions overcame poor initial impressions to become effective, dependable formations by the end of the war. The 61st (2nd South Midland) Division, for example, blamed for the failure at Fromelles, was commended by Lieutenant-General Hubert Gough, commander of the Fifth Army, as the best performing of his 11 front-line divisions in the initial onslaught of the German spring offensive in March 1918.

As the war progressed, Britain began to struggle with manpower shortages, prompting changes which affected the territorials. The 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) and 65th (2nd Lowland) Divisions had already been disbanded in July 1916 and March 1917 respectively. The remaining four home-based divisions lost their territorial affiliation when they were reconstituted as part of the Training Reserve over the winter of 1917/1918. In early 1918, every brigade in the BEF was reduced from four to three battalions. The reductions targeted second-line and New Army units, and resulted in the amalgamation of 44 territorial battalions and the disbandment of a further 21. In July, the 50th (Northumbrian) Division was left with a single territorial battalion when it was reorganised following heavy losses during the Spring Offensive. Its other territorial battalions, having fought in most battles since the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915, were reduced to a cadre or disbanded. All but one battalion in each brigade of the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the 60th (2/2nd London) Division in Palestine were transferred to France and replaced with Indian battalions in 1916. The 75th Division was formed in Egypt in March 1917 with territorial units transferred from India, though it too was subsequently &#x27;indianised&#x27;. Several territorial battalions from the 42nd (East Lancashire), 46th (North Midland) and 59th (2nd North Midland) Divisions were reduced to training cadres, demobilised or disbanded shortly before the war&#x27;s end. The apparent cull of territorial units added to the grievances harboured by the Territorial Force about its treatment by the military authorities.

==Erosion of the territorial identity==

Many territorial battalions had strong individual identities based on the geography of their recruitment. The ranks had been filled by men who, at least until direct voluntary recruitment into the Territorial Force ceased in December 1915, had chosen the force in preference to the new or regular armies. They had elected to join local regiments and been imbued with an &quot;esprit de corps&quot; during their training in those regiments&#x27; own second and later third lines. The strong sense of locality was reinforced by a shared civilian background – it was not uncommon for territorials to be employed in the same office, mill or factory – and many territorial memoirs betray a sense of family or club. A similar sentiment was exploited in raising the New Army pals battalions, but in the Territorial Force this was reinforced by a pedigree that New Army units did not possess; most territorial units could trace a lineage back to the early or mid 19th century through units of yeomanry or volunteers which had for generations been a part of local communities and social life.

===Replacements===
In the first half of the war, territorial casualties were generally replaced with drafts from a battalion&#x27;s own reserve. Although there were some cases of replacements being sourced from different regions or non-territorial units, in mid-1916 the ranks of the territorial units were still largely populated by men who had volunteered specifically for service as a territorial in their local regiment. The legal protections for this were stripped away by the Military Service Acts of 1916. These permitted the amalgamation and disbandment of units and the transfer of territorials between them, introduced conscription, and required territorials either to accept the Imperial Service Obligation or leave the force and become liable for conscription.

The last recruits to voluntarily enlist in a specific unit of the Territorial Force before the choice was removed, and who had trained in that unit&#x27;s third line alongside neighbours and colleagues, had been drafted to their front-line units by May 1916. In September 1916, the regiment-based system for training New Army units was centralised into the Training Reserve. Separately, the 194 territorial third-line units were amalgamated into 87 Reserve Battalions. They retained responsibility for supplying replacements to the first- and second-line units, but when unable to do so, replacements were sent from the Training Reserve. The system was organised by region, so even if a battalion did not receive replacements from its own regiment they were generally sourced from an appropriate locality, but it did not guarantee unit integrity.
After the heavy losses sustained during the Somme offensive, dilution of the territorial identity accelerated because of the influx of replacements who had no territorial affiliation. Some units still maintained a regional identity; the 56th (1/1st London) Division, for example, retained its essentially London character despite the fact that the four battalions of its 168th Brigade received replacements from at least 26 different regiments during the battle. Others experienced substantial dilution by the end of the offensive; the 149th (Northumberland) Brigade, for example, received large numbers of replacements from East Anglia, Northamptonshire, London and the Midlands. By March 1917, a significant proportion of the men in the second-line 61st (2nd South Midland) Division came from outside the South Midlands due to the replacement of losses suffered at the Battle of Fromelles. By the end of the year, the same trend could be seen in the first-line 48th (South Midland) Division.

The indiscriminate replacement of casualties prompted rueful comments about the damage being done to the nature of the Territorial Force. The historian C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, serving with the 1/4th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment, lamented that, by the end of 1916, the battalion had &quot;lost its exclusive Berkshire character which, at the beginning of the war, had been its unique possession&quot;. For the 1/6th Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, losses during the Battle of the Somme had damaged its &quot;territorial influence&quot;. Criticisms of the drafting system were voiced in the House of Commons, and territorial representatives expressed concern that the force&#x27;s unique character was being lost. Military authorities stated their desire to replenish units with replacements from the same regiment or regimental district, but stressed that the Military Service Acts had removed any obligation to do so and that military expediency sometimes necessitated not doing so.

As the availability of men of military age dwindled, it became increasingly difficult to source replacements from some sparsely populated regions. The largely rurally recruited 48th (South Midland) and 54th (East Anglian) Divisions became increasingly diluted as the war progressed, while the more urbanised recruitment areas of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division allowed it to remain essentially a Lancashire formation throughout. By the war&#x27;s end, very few battalions still retained more than a handful of men who had embarked with them at the start of the war. The territorial units that fought in 1917 and 1918, subject to the same system of replacements as the rest of the British land forces, bore little resemblance beyond a geographic origin to those that had sailed in 1914 and 1915. By 1918, there was little to differentiate between regular, territorial and New Army divisions.

===Territorial grievances===

Failure to guarantee the integrity of its units was the most contentious of several grievances felt by the territorials against what they perceived as a hostile and patronising attitude from the military authorities. Territorial officers and specialists such as doctors, vets, drivers, cooks and dispatch riders received less pay than their counterparts in New Army and regular units. Officers were considered junior to their regular counterparts of the same rank, leading some to remove the &#x27;T&#x27; insignia from their uniforms as a badge of inferiority, and commanders of second-line brigades and third-line battalions were a rank lower than their regular counterparts. Although the Territorial Force provided many officers for the regular army, very few were appointed to higher commands, despite pre-war promises by Haldane that they would be. In 1918, government efforts to defend the military record on senior territorial promotions failed to acknowledge that most were temporary and in home units. Ian Macpherson, Under-Secretary of State for War, conceded that just ten territorial officers commanded brigades and only three had been promoted to highest grade of General Staff Officer. The territorials received scant recognition for their early enthusiasm. The Army Council refused to grant any special decorations for those who had accepted the Imperial Service Obligation before the war. The Territorial War Medal, awarded to those who had volunteered for service overseas in the first months of the war, was denied to volunteers who had been held back even though they rendered invaluable service training the rest of the army. Those who served in India received no campaign medal.

The three territorial divisions sent to India in 1914 felt penalised by their early readiness. The men were placed on lower, peacetime rates of pay; gunners had to purchase equipment that should have been issued; officers attending courses were not fully reimbursed for their hotel expenses; and non-commissioned officers promoted after arrival had to protest before they received the pay increase to which they were entitled. The divisions were still stationed there at the war&#x27;s end, despite promises made by Kitchener that they would be redeployed to France within a year. Indications that they would be the first to be demobilised proved false when the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Afghan War forced the government to retain some territorial units in India until 1920. The poor treatment of the territorials in India resulted in low support across south-west England and the home counties, the regions from which the three divisions were recruited, when the Territorial Force was reconstituted after the war.

====County territorial associations====
The county territorial associations experienced a steady erosion of responsibilities as the war progressed. Although disappointed by Kitchener&#x27;s decision to bypass the Territorial Force, the associations assisted in recruiting the New Army alongside their own work raising and equipping territorial units. The Cambridgeshire, Denbighshire and East Riding associations, for example, together raised 11 New Army units in December 1914. The associations performed remarkably well in equipping their units, despite the fact that the War Office prioritised New Army units and, in the case of the Leicestershire associations, threatened to penalise manufacturers who dealt with any institution other than the War Office. The competitive nature of the system led to supply according to highest bidder rather than military necessity and, in consequence, inflated prices. As a result, the territorials were relieved of responsibility for the purchase and supply of equipment in favour of a centralised system in May 1915.

In December 1915, direct recruitment into the Territorial Force ceased. The next year, the associations were rendered largely superfluous when administration of several territorial services, including the second- and third-line units and Home Service Battalions, was taken from them. In March 1917, many territorial depots were shut down as a result of War Office centralisation, and later the same year territorial records offices were closed. The Council of County Territorial Associations met in September to discuss the loss of responsibilities and the apparent erosion of the Territorial Force. A delegation in October to Lord Derby, secretary of state for war, resulted only in the associations being given responsibility for the Volunteer Training Corps (VTC). Regarded as a poor substitute for the Territorial Force, the VTC was recruited from those not eligible for active service, mainly due to age. It was widely denigrated as &quot;Grandpa&#x27;s Regiment&quot; and &quot;George&#x27;s Wrecks&quot;, from the armbands inscribed with the letters &quot;GR&quot; (for &quot;Georgius Rex&quot;), which was all the uniform the government was initially willing to provide them with.

==Post-war==

Between August 1914 and December 1915, the Territorial Force had attracted nearly 726,000 recruits, approximately half the number that had volunteered for the New Army over the same period. It had raised 692 battalions by the war&#x27;s end, compared with 267 regular or reserve battalions and 557 New Army battalions. The force deployed 318 battalions overseas, compared to the New Army&#x27;s 404, and fielded 23 infantry and two mounted divisions on foreign soil, compared to the New Army&#x27;s 30 infantry divisions. Seventy-one awards of the Victoria Cross, Britain&#x27;s highest award for valour, were made to territorial soldiers, including two of only three bars ever awarded. The territorials had suffered some 577,000 casualties in the period 1914–1920. Compromised in conception and ridiculed in peacetime, the Territorial Force had filled the gap between what was effectively the destruction of the regular army in the opening campaigns of the war and the arrival of the New Armies in 1915.

Demobilisation of the Territorial Force commenced in December 1918, and the debate about its reconstitution was begun. The service rendered by the force during the war and the considerable political influence it possessed ensured its survival, but there was an extended discussion about what role it should play. In the absence of any invasion threat, there was no requirement to maintain a significant force for home defence, and a part-time body of volunteers could have no place in the imperial garrison. With conscription established as the means of expanding the regular army in a major conflict, which the Ten Year Rule anyway regarded as unlikely, there was no need to maintain a body of volunteers for this role. The only purpose military authorities could find for the Territorial Force was the provision of drafts to reinforce the army in medium-scale conflicts within the empire. Accordingly, the War Office recommended in March 1919 that the force should be liable for service overseas and receive no guarantees about unit integrity.

Winston Churchill, the Secretary of State for War responsible for reconstituting the force, considered a mandatory imperial obligation unfair and resisted its imposition. The territorial representatives recognised the necessity of such an obligation, but opposed the force being used simply as a reserve of manpower for the army, rather than operating as a second line in its own brigades and divisions as Haldane had intended. Territorial support for the imperial obligation eventually persuaded Churchill to accept it, and concerns about unit integrity were allayed by &quot;The Pledge&quot;, Churchill&#x27;s promise that the force would be deployed as complete units and fight in its own formations. The final sticking point was resolved by the resurrection of the militia to provide reinforcement drafts to the regular army.

Another issue was military aid to the civil power during the industrial unrest that followed the war. The thinly-stretched army was reluctant to become involved, so Churchill proposed using the territorials. Concerns that the force would be deployed to break strikes adversely affected recruitment, which had recommenced on 1 February 1920, resulting in promises that the force would not be so used. The government nevertheless deployed the Territorial Force in all but name during the miner&#x27;s strike of April 1921 by the hasty establishment of the Defence Force. The new organisation relied heavily on territorial facilities and personnel, and its units were given territorial designations. Territorials were specially invited to enlist. Although those that did were required to resign from the Territorial Force, their service in the Defence Force counted towards their territorial obligations, and they were automatically re-admitted to the Territorial Force once their service in the Defence Force was completed.

The Territorial Force was officially reconstituted in 1921 by the Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921 and renamed in October as the Territorial Army. The difficulties posed in the war by an auxiliary that maintained a separate identity from the regular army were still enshrined in the reconstituted auxiliary. They were finally addressed by the Armed Forces (Conditions of Service) Act, passed on the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, by which restrictions on territorial terms of service and transfer between units were removed and territorial status was suspended for the duration. The next war would be fought from the start by a single, integrated army.

<text>Robert Alan Ezrin (born March 25, 1949) is a Canadian music producer and keyboardist, best known for his work with Lou Reed, Alice Cooper, Aerosmith, Kiss, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, Peter Gabriel, Andrea Bocelli and Phish. As of 2010, Ezrin&#x27;s career in music had spanned six decades and his production work continued into the 21st century, with acts such as Deftones and Thirty Seconds to Mars. Ezrin is the winner of three Juno Awards. In 2011, he was awarded the Special Achievement Award at the 2011 SOCAN Awards held in Toronto. On 29 December 2022, Ezrin was named an Officer of the Order of Canada, the second-highest civilian honour in Canada.

==Early life==
Ezrin was born in Toronto, Ontario, on March 25, 1949 to Jewish parents. He resided in the Forest Hill area of Toronto.

==Music and production career==
As of 2014, Ezrin continued to work as a record producer, arranger and songwriter, in addition to being involved with a variety of other projects in digital media, live production, film, television, and theatrical production.

Ezrin has worked on recordings with numerous major artists, including Pink Floyd, Phish, Alice Cooper, KISS, Balloonatic, Deep Purple, Lou Reed, The Kings, Hanoi Rocks, Taylor Swift, Peter Gabriel, Bonham, K&#x27;naan, 2Cellos, Kristin Chenoweth, Rod Stewart, Nine Inch Nails, The Jayhawks, Thirty Seconds to Mars, The Darkness, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Dr. John, Nils Lofgren, Berlin, Kansas, Julian Lennon, Joe Bonamassa and Deftones, among many others. Ezrin also recorded the very first demos for Toronto band Max Webster.

Ezrin has been described by Alice Cooper as &quot;our George Martin&quot;. Following his first production work on an album with &quot;Love it to Death&quot; in 1971, Ezrin embarked on a long-term collaboration that, by 1973, would see the release of the number one album &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot;, a year after the success of &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;; Cooper subsequently became established as one of the biggest acts in the world. After the disbanding of Cooper&#x27;s group, Ezrin continued his collaboration with Cooper, as the latter embarked upon a solo career. In 1975, Cooper released the Ezrin-produced album, &quot;Welcome To My Nightmare&quot;. Ezrin worked with Cooper not just as a producer, but also as a co-writer, arranger, and musician.

Ezrin produced the best-selling KISS album &quot;Destroyer&quot; in 1976. As explained by Peter Criss during an interview in the documentary &quot;KISS: Krazy Killer&quot; (1994), Ezrin co-wrote, arranged and performed the piano accompaniment to the song &quot;Beth&quot;. Ezrin proceeded to produce two other albums with the band -- &quot;Music from &quot;The Elder&quot;&quot; and &quot;Revenge&quot;—and remains close to the band&#x27;s members in the 21st century.

Ezrin has worked with Pink Floyd on a number of occasions, co-producing the albums &quot;The Wall&quot;, &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;, and &quot;The Division Bell&quot;. He has also co-written the songs &quot;The Trial&quot;, &quot;Signs of Life&quot;, &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;, and &quot;Take It Back&quot;.

Ezrin also produced the 1988 Kansas album &quot;In the Spirit of Things&quot;, and received a writing credit for the song &quot;Ghosts&quot; and three other songs.

In May 2009, Ezrin co-produced The Clearwater Concert at Madison Square Garden, celebrating the 90th birthday of musician and activist Pete Seeger. More than 50 guest artists, including Bruce Springsteen, Dave Matthews, John Mellencamp, Ben Harper, Joan Baez, Tom Morello, Ani DiFranco, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson, performed at the event. Ezrin also co-produced the PBS broadcast of the event.

Since 2010, Ezrin has co-produced Peter Gabriel&#x27;s album &quot;Scratch My Back&quot;; co-produced &quot;The House Rules&quot;, by Christian Kane; and produced singles for K&#x27;naan, the Canadian Tenors, and young pop sensation Fefe Dobson for her album &quot;Joy&quot;. Ezrin also reunited with Cooper, working on Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Welcome 2 My Nightmare&quot;, on the corresponding live show, and numerous other related projects. He also mixed several projects, including Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;Speak Now World Tour Live&quot; CD and DVD (2011), and an album by The Darkness (2012).

In 2012, Ezrin remixed KISS&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Destroyer&quot;, which by then had gone Double Platinum.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-destroyer-deluxe-edition-release-date&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he produced albums for 2Cellos and rock legends Deep Purple. Bob worked with the band Phish on their 2014 release, &quot;Fuego&quot;. They reunited for the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Big Boat&quot;, released in 2016. Ezrin worked with Andrea Bocelli on &quot;Sì&quot;, Bocelli&#x27;s first No. 1 album, both in the UK and USA.

Ezrin produced a live and television extravaganza to reopen the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, US, starring Green Day and U2. He also worked on an album and live opera with L&#x27;Orchestra di Piazza Vittorio in Rome, Italy.

==Other ventures==

===Entrepreneurship===
In 1993, Ezrin co-founded a computer software company called 7th Level, which developed and published educational and entertainment CD-ROMs, including a series of Monty Python games.

In 1999, Ezrin co-founded Enigma Digital, an internet radio provider, that was eventually sold to Clear Channel; Ezrin was later appointed vice-chairman of Clear Channel Interactive. Ezrin was also Chairman of Live Nation Artists Recordings in 2007 and the first half of 2008.

Ezrin is also co-founder and vice chairman of Wow Unlimited Media.

In 2009, Ezrin, along with Garth Richardson and Kevin Williams, co-founded the Nimbus School of Recording Arts in Vancouver. Ezrin stated that his goal was to provide new engineers and producers with the hands-on teaching experience that he believed was no longer available from traditional recording studios.

===Philanthropy===
Ezrin is a board member of the Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus Foundation, a national initiative that supports music in US schools by donating musical instruments to under-funded music programs. He is also an Advisory Committee member of MusiCounts, the musical education initiative of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, that provides instruments to Canadian school music programs.

He is co-founder, with U2&#x27;s The Edge, of Music Rising, an initiative to preserve the musical culture of the Gulf coast region following the damage caused by the hurricanes and flooding of 2005.

On February 18, 2010, Ezrin helped with the mobilization of the Young Artists for Haiti group. Fifty Canadian artists recorded a rendition of hip hop star K&#x27;naan&#x27;s &quot;Wavin&#x27; Flag&quot; for the victims of the Haiti quake. The song was reworked by Ezrin to include specific lyrics for Haiti, with proceeds disseminated to Free the Children, War Child Canada, and World Vision Canada. The production raised over US$2 million. K&#x27;naan explained in regard to the initiation of the project: &quot;I got a call from Randy [Lennox, president] at Universal [Music Canada] and Bob Ezrin. They had this idea that they wanted to do something lasting, that actually educates young people in Canada about Haiti and not let the fatigue of the subject wash over everybody and everybody just forget Haiti.&quot;

Ezrin is a Chairman Emeritus of the Los Angeles Mentoring Partnership and a past Trustee and Governor of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS).

He is also a member of the Board of the Canadian Journalism Foundation, which promotes, celebrates and facilitates excellence in journalism.

As of 2022, Bob is engaged as a Canadian climate activist.

===Film and television===
In 1982, Ezrin briefly appeared as the host of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, a City-TV panel show that replaced Dr. Morton Shulman&#x27;s &quot;The Shulman File&quot;; he has also been a frequent interviewee for documentary films and television. Ezrin has created new theatrical, television, and live events with RadicalMedia, based in New York, including Jay-Z&#x27;s feature film, &quot;Fade to Black&quot;. In 2012, Ezrin appeared in &quot;Artifact&quot;, a documentary film about the modern music business focused on the legal battle between Thirty Seconds to Mars and record label EMI.

He is a co-producer of Melanie Doane&#x27;s children&#x27;s music television series &quot;Ukulele U&quot;.

==Honour and recognition==
Ezrin was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in April 2004 and the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame in March 2006.

In 2011, Ezrin and Young Artist for Haiti won the Juno Award in Canada for &quot;Single of the Year&quot;. Also in 2011, he was awarded an &quot;Outstanding Contribution&quot; at the Classic Rock Magazine Awards. In 2013, he was honoured with a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto.

Ezrin was also honoured in 2013 by The Royal Conservatory of Music, being named an Honorary Fellow of The Royal Conservatory.

In late 2022, Ezrin was named an Officer of the Order of Canada, &quot;For his ongoing contributions to music and entertainment production, and for his sustained advocacy of musical education, journalism and environmental justice.&quot;

In February 2025, Ezrin was named as a recipient of the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award.

==Personal life==
Ezrin is married to Janet Ezrin.

Ezrin moved to Los Angeles in 1985 and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in the 1990s. In 2025, having moved back to Toronto from Nashville, he started the process to renounce his U.S. citizenship. In the context of tensions between Canada and the U.S., he told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that he believed his Canadian honours represented not only recognition for prior work but also a responsibility to stand up for Canada going forward.

<text>The president of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam () is the head of state of Vietnam, elected by the National Assembly of Vietnam from its delegates. Since Vietnam is a one-party state, candidates for the post are nominated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam. The officeholder is generally considered to hold the second-highest position in the political system, practically after the general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam. As head of state, the president represents Vietnam both domestically and internationally, and maintains the regular and coordinated operation and stability of the national government and safeguards the independence and territorial integrity of the country. 

The president must be a delegate of the National Assembly. In addition, the president has traditionally been a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and a member of the Politburo. The Central Committee of the Communist Party nominates candidates to the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, which then confirms and nominates those candidates for official election by all delegates of the National Assembly.

The president appoints the vice president, prime minister, ministers, and other officials with the consent of the National Assembly. The president is furthermore the nominal supreme commander-in-chief of the Vietnam People&#x27;s Armed Forces and chairman of the Council for National Defense and Security. Additionally, the president is also a member of the Central Military Commission and the Central Police Party Committee. Since September 2011, the president is also the chairman of the Central Steering Committee for Judicial Reform. 

The powers and prestige of the office of president have varied over the years. For instance, while the inaugural president, Hồ Chí Minh, was also the chairman of the Communist Party, making him (in that capacity) the first ranking member of the Politburo, the highest decision-making body in Vietnam, his successor, Tôn Đức Thắng, was not a member of the Politburo and served as a symbolic figure under General Secretary Lê Duẩn. Since Trường Chinh&#x27;s ascension to the presidency, the president has been ranked 1st (if concurrently served as General Secretary) or 2nd in the order of precedence of the Communist Party&#x27;s Politburo, except for President Nguyễn Minh Triết (who ranked fourth) and President Võ Chí Công (who ranked third). Four persons served concurrently as head of both the party and state: Hồ Chí Minh (1951–1969), Trường Chinh (1986), Nguyễn Phú Trọng (2018–2021), and Tô Lâm (2024). 

The tenure of the presidency is five years, and a president can only serve three terms. If the president becomes unable to discharge duties of office, the vice president will assume the acting presidency on an interim basis until the president resumes duty, or until the election of a new president by the National Assembly. Vice President Võ Thị Ánh Xuân served as acting president of Vietnam twice, in 2023 and 2024. Her predecessor, Đặng Thị Ngọc Thịnh, was the first woman in Vietnamese history to assume the (acting) presidency following the death of President Trần Đại Quang in 2018.

General Lương Cường is the incumbent president of Vietnam, serving in this role since 21 October 2024, succeeding General Secretary Tô Lâm.

== History ==

Hồ Chí Minh was appointed Vietnam&#x27;s first president in 1946 by the National Assembly. The 1959 Constitutions stated that the National Assembly had the power to appoint and dismiss the president. The president represented Vietnam both internally and externally. The power and responsibilities of the president in 1946 constitution is very similar to the power and responsibilities of the president of the United States with elements from the president of France being both the head of state and the head of government. The 1959 constitution significantly reduced the power of the president, making the president the de jure leader of Vietnam while handling most of the de facto power to the post of general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam. The 1980 constitution transformed the office of head of state dramatically. The office of president was abolished and replaced with the office of Chairman of the Council of State (CC). The CC chairmanship was modelled after the Soviet office of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The Council of State, as with the Council of Ministers, was a collective decision-making body. Both the Council of State and the Council of Ministers were part of the executive branch; the strengthening of these institutions weakened the role of the legislative branch. The duties, powers and responsibilities of the Council of State were taken from the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, which lost most of its powers and prestige in the 1980 Constitution. 

The members of the Council of State were elected by the National Assembly and consisted of a chairman, deputy chairmen, a general secretary and other members. Council of State members could not concurrently be members of the Council of Ministers. The chairman of the Council of State was concurrently chairman of the National Defense Council (later the National Defense and Security Council) and commander-in-chief of the Vietnam People&#x27;s Armed Forces. The Council of State supervised the works of other institutions, most notably the Council of Ministers, the Supreme People&#x27;s Organ for Control and the People&#x27;s Councils at all levels. It also presided over the elections of the National Assembly. The office of Chairman of the Council of State, the head of state, was abolished in the 1992 Constitution and replaced by the office of President.

The importance of the president has not remained constant throughout Vietnamese history. For instance, while Hồ Chí Minh was ranked as first member of the Politburo, the highest decision-making body in Vietnam, his successor, Tôn Đức Thắng, was a symbolic figure with little power. The post of head of state was strengthened in the 1980 Constitution by the appointment of Trường Chinh who was, by order of precedence, the second-highest-ranking member in the Politburo, behind Lê Duẩn. The office of president retained the second highest rank in the Politburo order of precedence until Nguyễn Minh Triết was appointed in 2006; he ranked fourth in the Politburo hierarchy. The Politburo elected in the aftermath of the 11th National Party Congress (held in January 2011) by the Central Committee elected Trương Tấn Sang as the first-ranking member of the Politburo. This was the first time in Vietnamese history where the highest-ranking member of the Politburo does not hold post of either general secretary or chairman (was in existence from 1951 to 1969) of the party. Since Trương Tấn Sang is first-ranked member of the Politburo, he is the body&#x27;s unofficial head. Politburo meetings are held regularly; decisions within the Politburo are made through collective decision-making, and policies are only enacted if a majority of Politburo members supports them.

==Term of office==

The president is selected for a term of office of five years. The term of office of the incumbent president continues until the president-elect takes office.

On assuming office, the president takes the following oath before the parliament:

==Duties, powers and responsibilities==

The National Defense and Security Council (NDSC) is composed of the president, the prime minister and other members. The members of the NDSC are proposed by the president and approved by the National Assembly. NDSC members do not need to be members of the National Assembly. The decision-making process of the NDSC is that of a collective leadership. Among its powers is the right to mobilise all forces in the name of national defense, and in case of war the National Assembly can entrust the NDSC with special duties and powers.

From the current Constitution of Vietnam, the Vietnamese media has described the presidency to be relatively similar to the presidents of Singapore, Germany, Austria...which are largely ceremonial positions, however, the Vietnamese president still have certain, even though unclear, executive, judicial and legislative powers as designed by the Constitution. On the other hands, presidents of Vietnam are regularly one of the top-ranked members of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam, making them practically among the most influential figures of the Vietnamese politics alongside the constitutional powers that they gained from their formal presidency. The former president Võ Văn Thưởng was listed as the fourth-ranking figure in the current CPV Politburo, and Nguyễn Phú Trọng served as the state&#x27;s president from 2018 to 2021 while being the incumbent General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, the title for the highest-ranking member in the Politburo as well as in the whole Communist Party of Vietnam that he had held undisrupted since 2011.

==Succession==
According to Article 93 of the Constitution of Vietnam (2013):

&quot;When the President is incapacitated from work over a long period of time, the Vice President shall act as President. In case of vacancy of the Presidency, the Vice President shall serve as acting President until a new President is elected by the National Assembly.&quot;

<doc id="466689" wikidata="Q3066999" url="?curid=466689" title="Farquhar Oliver">
<text>Farquhar Robert Oliver (March 6, 1904 – January 22, 1989) was a politician in Ontario, Canada.

Oliver was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a United Farmers of Ontario Member of the Legislative Assembly in the 1926 provincial election at the age of 22.

Oliver was re-elected as a UFO MLA in the 1929 election and was the sole (and last) United Farmers member in the legislature until 1941. In that year, he formally joined the Ontario Liberal Party and the cabinet of Premier Mitchell Hepburn as Minister of Public Works and Welfare after informally supporting the Liberals and attending their caucus meetings since 1934. Oliver quit the cabinet in late October 1942, in protest against Hepburn&#x27;s leadership of the Liberal Party. Hepburn had quit as Premier of Ontario but refused to resign as leader, and appointed Gordon Daniel Conant as the new Premier without consulting the party. Oliver&#x27;s resignation contributed to a crisis that eventually led to both Hepburn and Conant&#x27;s resignations and a leadership convention in May 1943. Harry Nixon was elected the party&#x27;s new leader. Oliver rejoined the cabinet under new Premier Harry Nixon as Deputy Premier, but Nixon&#x27;s government was short-lived, going down to defeat in the October 1943 election placing third behind the victorious Progressive Conservatives and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation which became the Official Opposition.

Oliver became the party&#x27;s acting leader in the legislature in 1945, after Hepburn, who had regained the leadership of the party, lost his seat in the 1945 provincial election. The Liberals, nevertheless, displaced the CCF and Oliver became Leader of the Opposition and then permanent leader of the party in 1947 by defeating four other candidates to win a leadership convention. He led the party through the 1948 election that again reduced the Liberals to third place behind the Tories and CCF. Oliver resigned the leadership in 1950 and was replaced by Walter Thomson. However, Thomson was unable to win election to the legislature, so Oliver remained house leader. Oliver became party leader again from 1954 until 1958, including the 1955 election, but resigned due to caucus feuding. MPPs Albert Wren, who had placed second behind Oliver in the 1954 leadership convention, and Arthur Reaume attacked Oliver&#x27;s leadership of the party as ineffectual and were expelled from caucus in 1957, shortly before Oliver resigned so that a new leadership convention could be held. Despite his experience, he was never able to lead his party to victory. Farquhar Oliver retired from the legislature in 1967 and died in 1989 at the age of 84.

Farquhar Oliver was the nephew of British Columbia Premier John Oliver.

<doc id="466691" wikidata="Q2367409" url="?curid=466691" title="Judge Judy">
<text>Judge Judy is an American arbitration-based reality court show presided over by former Manhattan Family Court Judge Judith Sheindlin. The show featured Sheindlin as she adjudicated real-life small-claims disputes within a simulated courtroom set. Prior to the proceedings, all involved parties signed arbitration contracts agreeing to Sheindlin&#x27;s ruling. The show aired in first-run syndication. As it was during its active years in production, it continues to be distributed by CBS Media Ventures in syndication, now in reruns that still draw notably high ratings.

The series premiered on September 16, 1996, and concluded on July 23, 2021. The court show ended with its 25th season after Sheindlin and CBS renewed their contract for the final time in 2017. During its run in new episodes, the show did not release airings in the order they were taped. Thus the final filmed case of the series aired on June 8, 2021. While later seasons of the show are currently airing in syndication, the first three seasons are on Pluto TV&#x27;s &quot;Courtroom&quot; channel and their &quot;Judge Judy&quot; channel.

&quot;Judge Judy&quot; had an impact on courtroom programming, reviving the genre as a whole. It was the highest Nielsen-rated court show for the entirety of its 25-year run in original episodes, also frequently ranking as highest-rated television broadcast in daytime television and syndication. Of the court shows with a single series run (without on-and-off production from cancellation turned series revivals/recasting), &quot;Judge Judy&quot; had the most seasons. The series also won three Emmy Awards; earned Sheindlin a &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; recognition for longest serving television arbitrator; and originated many courtroom programming trends, from use of eponymous show titles to cold open trailers.

Two court spin-offs have been generated from &quot;Judge Judy&quot;: &quot;Judy Justice&quot;, starring Sheindlin as judge; and &quot;Tribunal Justice&quot;, featuring Byrd as bailiff. Like &quot;Judy Justice&quot;, &quot;Tribunal Justice&quot; is created by Sheindlin and streamed on Amazon Freevee.

==Background==

===Origins and development===
After Joseph Wapner was released from &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; on May 21, 1993, Sheindlin called up the program&#x27;s producers, Ralph Edwards-Stu Billett Productions and Warner Bros. Television, and offered to do the show in his place. The receptionist who answered the phone responded &quot;Are you crazy, lady?&quot; before directly hanging up on Sheindlin. Earlier that same year in February 1993, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article on Sheindlin&#x27;s reputation as one of the toughest family court judges in the country, written by Josh Getlin (inspired by his wife, Heidi, both of whom Sheindlin credits with her stardom) caught the attention of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, which aired a segment on her on October 24, 1993. The segment brought her national recognition, and days later from its airing, led to Sheindlin receiving an offer from a literary agent to write her first book. Sheindlin accepted the offer, writing &quot;Don&#x27;t Pee On My Leg and Tell Me It&#x27;s Raining&quot;, published on February 7, 1996. Its publisher, HarperCollins, expressed disapproval of her book title, claiming no one would promote it under that kind of name. Sheindlin stood her ground on the use of the title and ended up selling 216,709 copies.

In March 1995, two talent scouts (before that, former &quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot; producers) from a talent agency that was later entitled &quot;Rebel Entertainment&quot;, Kaye Switzer and Sandi Spreckman, asked Sheindlin if she would like to preside over her own courtroom series. Sheindlin eventually accepted, and the &quot;Rebel&quot; talent agency used a pilot episode to pitch to then-Big Ticket Television president Larry Lyttle in 1995. Switzer, Spreckman, along with Rebel Entertainment Owner Richard Lawrence later sued CBS and Sheindlin numerous times over allegedly owed profit shares for their part in commencing the program and introducing the two parties.

Sheindlin originally desired the show title to be &quot;Hot Bench&quot;, and the network and various news publications even promoted it as &quot;Hot Bench&quot; for some time prior to débuting, but Big Ticket Television ultimately decided on &quot;Judge Judy&quot;. The &quot;Hot Bench&quot; title was eventually used by Sheindlin, however, for a different court show she later created (2014–present), which does not feature Sheindlin herself, but rather a panel of judges she cast for the series.

Petri Hawkins-Byrd, referred to on the program simply as Byrd or Officer Byrd, was the bailiff on &quot;Judge Judy&quot; for the show&#x27;s entire 25-season run, making him the longest-serving bailiff in court television history. Byrd&#x27;s professional relationship with Sheindlin predates &quot;Judge Judy&quot; as he was her bailiff throughout her career in the Manhattan family court system. When Byrd found out about Sheindlin&#x27;s show, he sent her a congratulatory letter, stating, &quot;If you ever need a bailiff, I still look good in uniform.&quot; She phoned Byrd at his home in California to accept his offer, and he ended up replacing the unaired pilot episode bailiff. Sheindlin has stated that the show&#x27;s producers desired different individuals for the role of bailiff, but she refused.

Sheindlin has revealed that from the start, she only envisioned her courtroom program lasting 2 to 3 seasons, rationalizing that most TV ventures fail. Sheindlin appeared again on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; on April 30, 2003. During the interview, Sheindlin stated:
I have a contract with the company to do the program through the 2006 season. At that point, we will have produced this program for 10 years. Right now, I would be satisfied with a good 10-year run. I think that would really be phenomenal. It would be lovely if we could end on a high note and for me to say &quot;10 years and I still had people watching and I had a second career that was a blast.&quot;

On September 14, 2015, Sheindlin began celebrating her 20th season anniversary presiding on &quot;Judge Judy&quot;. The program is the first in the court show genre to make it to 20 seasons without cancellation, as well as the first to make it to this extent under one arbitrator. Three years later by September 2018, the &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; court show entered its 20th season and became the second and only other court show to accomplish this feat. Sheindlin&#x27;s distinction as television&#x27;s longest-serving judge or arbitrator won her a place in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; on September 14, 2015. &quot;Judge Judy&quot; completed its series run at 25 seasons. In honor of the 25th and final season of the program, Josh Getlin published another article on Sheindlin. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article, published on June 8, 2021 (the same day as the airing of the final filmed case), shared background details about the 1993 article that catapulted Sheindlin&#x27;s television career and his relationship with Sheindlin.

===On-air format===
Each episode of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; begins with a cold open trailer of the main case, sensationalizing various moments of the case with brief soundbites accompanied with dramatic music, voice-over commentary, graphics, etc. This is followed by the show&#x27;s title sequence music video. At the beginning of each court proceeding, information regarding who is suing whom and what for is revealed by voice-over commentary. When Sheindlin made her entrance, the courtroom audience was brought to order and instructed to rise by Byrd. He then informed Sheindlin of the docket number on the court calendar in the midst of providing Sheindlin a file of legal statements about the case, and directing audience members to be seated.

Sheindlin typically began each case by summarizing the disputed matters brought before her. This was followed by preliminary questioning of the parties as to dates, times, locations, and other scene-setting facts before addressing the crux of the lawsuit. Governing the discourse throughout the cases, Sheindlin typically allowed only brief portions of each of the testimonies; having read the parties&#x27; sworn statements before the taping, she was quick to reply, impose her spiel, and disallow responses that were not concise or which interrupted her. Less frequently, Sheindlin allowed one or both of the opposing litigants to recount the entirety of their testimony. During the proceedings, Sheindlin coerced the parties to adhere to her strict management: participants were not allowed to tuck hands in pockets, drink water (unless they ask first), fold arms, chew gum, appear for court dressed at all revealingly or casually, speak out of turn, hesitate in answering questions, offer statements of hearsay, assert to the knowledge and thoughts of others, and had to maintain eye contact with Sheindlin while relaying testimony, among other things. If Sheindlin deemed that children were not needed to testify, she directed Byrd to escort them out of the courtroom at the outset of the proceedings. If children testified, occasionally teens as well, Sheindlin would have them sit on the witness stand next to her, which Byrd typically stood in front of. Sheindlin would also have Byrd give her important documentation related to the case such as pictures, letters, contracts, bills (medical bills, auto repair bills, etc), and later, text messages. Byrd would also play videos and give Sheindlin Kelly Blue Book car values (such as on a Dodge Dakota.) Judy also made phone calls from her office if she deemed it necessary to do so.

Like most modern court shows, cases on &quot;Judge Judy&quot; imitated small claims court cases in which civil trials (non-criminal cases) were heard and ruled on. Typically Sheindlin handled cases among former lovers, disputing neighbors, couples, or family and friend relations. Disputes generally revolved around issues such as broken engagements, unpaid personal loans, contract breaches, personal injuries from other litigants or their pets, minor property damages (e.g., fender benders, carpet stains, etc.), the fate of jointly purchased household appliances, landlord disputes, and rightful ownership of property. As is standard practice in small claims court and most reality court shows alike, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; proceedings operated in the form of a bench trial (as opposed to its more common counterpart, the jury trial). Moreover, lawyers were not present, and litigants had to represent themselves. Generally each show presented two cases, but infrequently, an episode would present a single long case, three shorter ones, or even four shorter ones. Some cases took two episodes or more to resolve, and some involved the plaintiff and defendant switching sides halfway through.

After expressing her views of the circumstances and behaviors of the litigants with regards to their testimonies, Sheindlin rendered the judgment either by finding for the plaintiff (typically by stating, &quot;Judgement for the plaintiff in the amount of &quot;x&quot; dollars,&quot;) and a closing exclamation, (such as &quot;That&#x27;s all,&quot; &quot;We&#x27;re done,&quot; or &quot;Goodbye!&quot;), or by dismissing the case specifically with or without prejudice. After she ruled and exited the courtroom, Byrd was heard stating: &quot;Parties are excused. You may step out,&quot; after which he escorted the litigants out of the courtroom. Any counterclaims filed were handled similarly. If Judy recalled a case, Byrd would state: &quot;Parties are excused. This case will be recalled,&quot; and once the case continued, Byrd would say &quot;Parties are reminded you&#x27;re still under oath.&quot;

At the end of each case, there was typically a fourth-wall–breaking segment during which litigants, and sometimes their witnesses, expressed their feelings regarding the case directly to broadcast viewers. Sometimes, however, these segments were omitted, especially after cases involving resentful litigants, too upset over the circumstances to remain in the studio and provide comments.

===Inside details and inner workings===
The producers of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; hired extras from an audience service who composed the entire studio. Paid audience members were easier to control due to contracts and employment. Producers also looked for a certain demographic of individuals and sat them strategically throughout their audience. Most of these paid extras were aspiring actors. Though tickets were not offered for the show, arrangements could sometimes be made with Sheindlin&#x27;s production staff to allow fans of the show into the audience. The extras could not dress casually, and no logos or brand names could be visible on their clothing. Extras were also instructed to appear as if they were having discussions with each other before and after each case, so Byrd made such announcements as &quot;Order! All rise.&quot;

To acquire cases, the show generally used one of the following three options:
* Its 60 to 65 researchers, spread out across the country, entered small claims courts and photocopied numerous cases. These photocopied cases were then sent to &quot;Judge Judy&quot; producers, who reviewed them all in search of lawsuits they believed made for good television. According to the show&#x27;s producers, only 3% of the photocopied cases were worthy enough for television.
* Its telephone number posting/announcement presented on each episode where interested individuals could call in with lawsuits.
* Its website whereby lawsuits could be written out and submitted to the show.

After one of these three processes, if the producers were interested, their employees would then call both parties and ask them questions relating to their lawsuit, making sure they were suitable for &quot;Judge Judy&quot;. If the parties agreed to be on the show and signed an arbitration contract, agreeing that arbitration in Sheindlin&#x27;s court was final and couldn&#x27;t be pursued elsewhere (unless Sheindlin dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice), their case would air on &quot;Judge Judy&quot;.

The award limit on &quot;Judge Judy&quot;, as on most &quot;syndi-court&quot; shows (and most small claims courts in the U.S.), was $5,000. The award for each judgment was paid by the producers of the show from a fund reserved for the purpose. Sheindlin ruled by either A.) issuing a verdict of a specific dollar amount (not always in the full amount of what is requested and rarely if ever more than what was requested even if she believed complainants were deserving of more) or B.) by dismissing the lawsuit altogether. When ruled on in these manners, cases couldn&#x27;t be refiled or retried elsewhere. However, if Sheindlin specifically dismissed the lawsuit &quot;without prejudice&quot;, that lawsuit could be refiled and retried in another forum. In some instances, Sheindlin deliberately dismissed cases without prejudice to allow complainants to bring their case in an actual court of law, making the defendants financially accountable as opposed to the show. In such cases, Sheindlin had expressed particular aversion to the defendants in question. Further, Sheindlin dismissed cases without prejudice when she suspected both the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s) of conspiring together to gain monetary rewards from the program.

Both the plaintiff(s) and the defendant(s) also received an appearance fee. The appearance fee amount had varied between different litigants of the show: certain litigants had reported receiving a $500 appearance fee while others had reported receiving $100, and others $250. In addition to the appearance fee amount, reportedly (at least some) litigants were paid $35 a day by the show. The litigants&#x27; stay lasted for the number of days that the show did taping for that week, which was two or three days. In addition, the airfare (or other means of travel) and hotel expenses of the litigants and their witnesses were covered by the show, and the experience was generally treated as an all-expense-paid vacation outside of the actual court case. If there was an exchange of property, Sheindlin signed an order, and a sheriff or marshal oversaw the exchange. Sheindlin saw only a half-page complaint and a defense response before the taping of the cases, sometimes only moments before. Most of the cases, not including any footage deleted to meet the time constraints of the show, usually lasted anywhere from twelve to forty-five minutes.

&quot;Judge Judy&quot;, like most court programs, was inexpensive to produce and thus created considerable income. A budget for a week&#x27;s worth of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; episodes was half the cost of a single network sitcom episode.

===Recordings and airings===
Three days every other week (two weeks a month), Sheindlin and her producers taped the court show. They usually produced ten to twelve cases for each day they taped the show. This made for about a week&#x27;s worth of episodes, all done within one day. Anywhere from thirty to thirty-six cases were taped over three days during the week. Sheindlin appeared as a guest on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on September 13, 2011. When asked by Kimmel how many days a month she works, Sheindlin replied, &quot;Five days.&quot; Sheindlin and her producers sometimes taped only five cases per day and two days per week. The show had fifty-two taping days a year. For each season, some 650 claims were brought to the set to be &quot;presided&quot; over by Judge Judy. This means approximately 16,250 claims had been brought to Judy Sheindlin&#x27;s Hollywood set by the show&#x27;s completion.

For the most part, cases were taped throughout the year except for two breaks Sheindlin and all of the staff members of her show had for the year. One of the two breaks included an extra week off in December, as the show was only taped one week out of that month because of the holidays. The other break was from mid-July (only taping one week in July) and all through August. According to members of the show, the reason for this break was that people were more interested in taking vacations than in filing lawsuits around that time. When the seasons premiered in September, only episodes perceived as the best by program staff of the ones taped before Sheindlin&#x27;s break were selected to start the season. Thus, the first few weeks (the first week in particular) would consist of what the show felt to be its best episodes. In Sheindlin&#x27;s words, &quot;It&#x27;s like drinking wine. You don&#x27;t serve the really good bottle of wine third.&quot;

Altogether, there were 260 new episodes each season. There was at least one new episode for every weekday, except a few hiatuses during most of the summer, a couple of holidays, early spring (much of March and April), and in the latter seasons of the show. The cases were all pre-recorded for editing purposes and would usually air one to three months after being taped. The cases were mixed up and not shown in order of when they were recorded. While the cases taped in March (sometimes April) ended the seasons, the cases taped throughout April, May, June, and July started each season in September and lasted through October.
Throughout the very beginning of each season, two new &quot;Judge Judy&quot; episodes aired per day. After two weeks, this was reduced to one new airing a day, followed by a repeat. There were also various other moments throughout the year where two new episodes were shown for a few weeks. This had sometimes included January when the show returned from its winter hiatus. Two new episodes were also shown daily during the &quot;sweeps&quot; months of November, February, and May. Unlike other television programs, the &quot;Judge Judy&quot; season finale did not air in April or May; rather, it aired in June, July, August, or sometimes even very early September just before the following season. When the season finale was extended to July, August, or September, most of the summer episodes preceding it were repeats with new episodes that were few and far in between.

Two DVDs, featuring &quot;memorable cases&quot;, were released by the show: the first in 2007, &quot;Judge Judy: Justice Served,&quot; and the second in 2008, &quot;Judge Judy: Second To None.&quot;

===Location===

For its entire 25-season run, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; taped at the Sunset Bronson Studios on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. In alternating weeks, Sheindlin, who owns a home in New York among other cities/states, flew out on her private jet to tape her show, typically Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

From 2014 through the conclusion of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; in 2021, the show&#x27;s courtroom set was located directly beside the set of the courtroom series Sheindlin created and produces, &quot;Hot Bench.&quot; &quot;Hot Bench&quot; remains in production at the Sunset Bronson Studios. Previous to that, the space directly beside Sheindlin&#x27;s set was used for the courtroom series &quot;Paternity Court&quot;, only for the 2013–14 television season (that court show&#x27;s 1st season). Prior to that, the space was used for &quot;Judge Judy&quot;″s sister show &quot;Judge Joe Brown&quot; until &quot;Judge Joe Brown&quot;″s 2013 cancellation. Like &quot;Judge Judy&quot;, &quot;Judge Joe Brown&quot; was also produced by Big Ticket Entertainment. The two shows alternated taping weeks.

Despite the show being taped primarily in California, it displayed various images of New York City during the incoming commercial bumpers (audio and visuals shown returning from commercial breaks), including New York subways, parks, monuments, etc. In addition, the words &quot;State of New York&quot; and &quot;Family Court&quot; (Sheindlin was previously a New York family court judge in addition to being a native of New York) scrolled back and forth within the letterbox-like graphics that appeared during the show&#x27;s outgoing and incoming commercial bumpers, lasting from season 9 through 25. The set also featured a New York state flag (positioned across from an American flag) situated behind Judge Judy Sheindlin&#x27;s chair.

==Program remodeling and restyling updates==
Over the show&#x27;s 25-year existence, it saw very few restyling updates from season to season, that is, outside of seasons 1, 2, 9, and 25 (season 25 due to COVID-19). Outside of initial seasons and the final season, most modifications to the program had been done in minute detail, such as to the show&#x27;s bookshelf display seen near the courtroom entrance. Aesthetically, the show&#x27;s theme song, graphics, and color scheme were the only aspects that had changed repeatedly throughout its lifespan.

===Original format, seasons 1 through 8===
Season 1, and specifically its initial episodes, took a strikingly contrasting presentation from the latter seasons of the show. The courtroom set design and stage props vastly differed from what would become commonplace for the court show. The first episodes of season 1 also used music composed by Fred Lapides: a piano-based melody for the title sequence and closing credits. This theme music was never to be used again outside of the early stages of season 1 in 1996. The show&#x27;s season 1 voice-over artist Michael Stull was heard narrating this intro theme, stating: &quot;This is Judge Judy. Real people—in real cases—in real conflict. She was a real judge with over 15 years of courtroom experience.&quot;

After numerous episodes towards the beginning of season one, the show&#x27;s theme music was completely revamped to a percussive drum-like, ascending melody composed by Bill Bodine. Integrated into the modified theme music, the narration during the title sequence was also updated with Michael Stull announcing, &quot;You are about to enter the courtroom of Judge Judith Sheindlin. The people are real. The cases are real. The rulings are final. This is her courtroom. This is Judge Judy.&quot; This narration lasted through season 8 of the program, though Jerry Bishop took over the narration by season 2.

When the show switched to the melody composed by Bill Bodine in season 1, the opening music video was updated to motioning scenes of Sheindlin from the bench, gesticulating as though presiding over cases. These motioning images moved freely until colliding with an image of the &quot;Judge Judy&quot; courthouse logo, emphasized by a striking cymbal-like sound effect. The background scene for this title sequence music video was originally depicted in navy blue for a short portion of season 1 before switching to a sea green that same season through the 4th season.

In season 4, the entire courtroom set was redesigned while retaining the sea green and saffron graphics and intro.

By seasons 5 through 8, the title sequence commenced with an approaching scene towards a computer animated courthouse display up until that scene entered the courthouse. From there, several shots of Sheindlin gesticulating from her bench—as though presiding over various cases—were displayed in motion. These motioning images eventually developed into the courthouse logo that represents the program (the logo is always displayed within the letter &quot;D&quot; in &quot;Judy&quot;) by the end of this opening music video. The graphics were also changed to blue and saffron along with this change.

In the seventh season, while the theme song remained, the instrumentals were updated. In addition, the font for the short closing credits and litigants font was updated but the long closing credits retained the original font. By the eighth season, the font was completely changed and the returning from commercial break scenes were replaced with New York City scenes.

Strikingly atypical to most of the show&#x27;s run, the first few seasons saw litigators and their witnesses readily speaking out of turn, bickering between each other and taking to misbehaviors without Sheindlin exacting the strict measures for which later became a staple of the program.

===Season 9===
The ninth season (2004–05) was one of the few seasons in which the show underwent major remodeling when music for the show&#x27;s opening, closing, and to/from commercial portions were modified. A remixed version of a melody from Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony was then adopted as the show&#x27;s title sequence and closing music. This arrangement was composed by Non-Stop Music Productions. During the program&#x27;s outgoing commercial bumpers (short portions of the program that took each episode to a commercial break, in the case of this program, adding previews of the remainder of the case or cases to be featured in the episode) a dramatic violin-like melody sounded in contrast to the Beethoven remix. When the program resumed with its incoming commercial bumper, the Beethoven remix once again played. Additionally, solemn violin-like striking tones sounded directly following Sheindlin&#x27;s final verdict of each episode, lasting from season 9 through the remainder of the show&#x27;s run. The graphics also began showing up in falu red.

The intro was also changed for the ninth season as well. For its scenes, the Lady Justice statue is shown followed by a split screen of Sheindlin and the Statue of Liberty (over a blue background) followed by Sheindlin approaching the camera folding her arms and smiling. This is followed by shots of her presiding over different cases (which are shown in the scales of the Lady Justice statue in cubes).

For much of the series outside of the initial episodes, the opening music video consisted of voice-over artist Jerry Bishop stating: &quot;You are about to enter the courtroom of Judge Judith Sheindlin. The people are real. The cases are real. The rulings are final. This is &quot;Judge Judy&quot;.&quot; Originally between the statements &quot;The rulings are final&quot; and &quot;This is Judge Judy&quot; was the statement, &quot;This is her courtroom.&quot; This line was dropped in 2004 when season 9 began.

===Seasons 10 through 23===
Beginning in September 2012, the show made a switch to high definition with its 17th season. The bumpers between commercials are also in HD, although most on-screen graphics such as plaintiff and defendant descriptions are framed to fit a 4:3 aspect ratio.

Late into the show&#x27;s 23rd season, Sheindlin drastically altered her hairstyle by abandoning the bouffant hairdo that she had sported since the show&#x27;s beginnings; she replaced that with a new style created from her hair pulled back and bounded by a clip-on hair bun at the back of her head. Her new hairstyle sparked widespread attention, and considerable negative reviews from viewers (media spectators alike) to the point that the show&#x27;s Facebook moderator admonished posters that negative commentary about the clip-on bun would be deleted.

Her bailiff, Petri Hawkins-Byrd, admitted to a preference for the original hairdo. Asked about the change in hairstyle, Sheindlin described the former as &quot;a lot of goop and teasing and product and fussing around by somebody else. This is so much easier. And as each hour in every day we have becomes more precious, the less you want to spend time patshkeing over the way you look.&quot;

===COVID-19, seasons 24 and 25===
In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the 24th season production of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; to end prematurely at only 199 episodes, 61 episodes fewer than the show&#x27;s typical season number of 260.

When &quot;Judge Judy&quot; returned for season 25, its final season, a multitude of COVID-19 precautionary measures were in place, vastly distinguishing this season of the show from previous seasons. Sheindlin presided remotely from New York; producers built a partial makeshift set there for her, with a different set design behind her and a larger, darker executive chair. Byrd and the litigants (and witnesses, if any) participated from the Los Angeles studio, now devoid of audience members. Sheindlin interacted with the litigants through a live Internet link. Because Byrd could not physically convey evidence between her and the litigants, evidence was scanned with a document camera at the litigant lecterns, allowing Sheindlin to view it remotely. In addition, litigant afterthoughts following the case were shared at the podiums, instead of in the hallway set used pre-COVID.

Steve Kamer took over as voice-over announcer for the 25th season after Jerry Bishop&#x27;s death on April 21, 2020.

==Episodes==
===Series pilot and finale, final taped case===
On May 21, 2021, Sheindlin was asked by &quot;USA Today&quot; what she recalled of her unaired &quot;Judge Judy&quot; pilot episode, used to sell the series to Big Ticket Television. Sheindlin responded by expressing great disfavor of the pilot episode, indicating that &quot;Judge Judy&quot; producers only set up fictionalized cases and steered her to dramatized reactions and behaviors. This ultimately ended up in Sheindlin&#x27;s production team sending only bits and pieces of the pilot to CBS for approval of the show&#x27;s broadcast. During the interview, Sheindlin recounted:

I remember that somebody then was trying to fit me into a sort of (mold). They had seen the &quot;60 minutes&quot; [documentary], and they thought the approach that they saw in &quot;60 minutes&quot; could be almost a caricature, and I&#x27;m not a caricature of that person, I am that person. So the cases that they brought to me to do the pilot were not genuine, and I couldn&#x27;t react to things that weren&#x27;t genuine. Because when I&#x27;m trying to figure out the truth of a case, and there really is no truth, I can&#x27;t work. So they took little snippets of the pilot and created a sizzle reel, along with &quot;60 Minutes&quot; tape and sold that.&quot;

Sheindlin taped the final case of the series on April 15, 2021. The case, described by media spectators as mundane, saw a general contractor suing his customer over unpaid work. In this final taped case of the series, Sheindlin also made no farewell remarks nor gave any attention to it being the series&#x27; close. While this final filmed case (episode 179 of season 25, &quot;Judge Judy Makes a Call!/Mother vs. Son&quot;) aired on June 8, 2021, cases taped before that point continued to air for the first time through the series finale episode, which aired on July 23, 2021 (episode 200 of season 25, &quot;Architecture Barter Gone Bad&quot;). Worthy to note, only one detail made Sheindlin&#x27;s final filmed case of the series on June 8 stand out among other episodes since it was not featured in the series finale episode: that is a glittery, bee-shaped clip that Sheindlin wore in her hair. Sheindlin explained that this was a wink to her &quot; Judge Judy&quot; fans and a nod to her Queen Bee production company at the end of a 25-year reign over daytime television.

Sheindlin addressed that never once throughout 25 years of filming her courtroom series did her appeal for the job wane. &quot;I was as enthusiastic and rigorous in the last case that I taped as I was at the beginning,&quot; Sheindlin pointed out. On her final day of taping, Sheindlin was not in low spirits. Rather, she was reflective on her tenure on the show as &quot;a job well done&quot;, with excitement about her new spin-off series, &quot;Judy Justice&quot;. Of her thoughts on ending the program, Sheindlin added:

I think that one of the reasons why I wasn&#x27;t teary is because I wasn&#x27;t going into a vast unknown. I wasn&#x27;t going to do a cooking show. I was gonna be doing exactly what I was doing, exactly what I do, but in a different format.

===&quot;Judge Judy Primetime&quot;===
On May 20, 2014, CBS aired a one-hour special called &quot;Judge Judy Primetime&quot; which aired at 8 p.m. ET/PT. The special was a combination of reshown clips from the 1993 &quot;60 Minutes Special&quot; on Sheindlin, as well as a few never before seen cases. The special marked &quot;Judge Judy&quot;″s first airing in primetime, a landmark for court shows which are typically limited to daytime or late night hours. It brought in 5.66 million viewers, enough to make it the night&#x27;s top-rated show on CBS. In addition, the special came in just behind &quot;American Idol&quot;, which brought in 6.61 million viewers.

===Contrived case===
At least one case in the series was allegedly contrived by the litigants just to receive monetary payment from the program.

In April 2013, former litigants from a 2010 airing of the show revealed they conspired together in fabricating a lawsuit in which the logical outcome would be to grant payment to the plaintiff. The operation, devised by musicians Kate Levitt and Jonathan Coward, was successful: Sheindlin awarded the plaintiff (Levitt) $1,000. The litigants involved also walked away with an appearance fee of $250 each and an all-expense-paid vacation to Hollywood, California. In reality, all the litigants in question—plaintiffs and defendants alike—were friends who split the earnings up among each other. It was also reported that the show&#x27;s producers were suspicious of the scam all along, but chose to look the other way. The lawsuit was over the fictitious death of a cat as a result of a television crushing it.

==&quot;Judge Judy&quot; in external media==

=== &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; ===
Sheindlin and her program appeared on the November 26, 2017, broadcast of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, presiding over a sketch comedy court case with Larry David as the plaintiff who unsuccessfully sued the previous owner of his house over custody of a sick ficus plant she left behind when she moved out, but later stole back. The pseudo-Judge Judy case assumed the appearance of an actual case from Sheindlin&#x27;s program, taking place from the show&#x27;s courtroom set with trademarked voice-over briefs, theme music, and audience response.

=== &quot;CHiPs &#x27;99&quot; ===
Sheindlin appeared as herself, presiding judge on her &quot;Judge Judy&quot; courtroom program in the 1998 American made-for-television crime drama film, &quot;CHiPs &#x27;99&quot;. Leading up to her cameo, Officer Francis (Frank) Llewelyn Poncherello &quot;Ponch&quot; (played by Erik Estrada) twists the arm of Captain Jonathan Baker (played by Larry Wilcox) into appearing on her television courtroom program. Uneasy about the idea of humiliating himself on national television, Baker acquiesces and ends up suing Nyeman (played by Googy Gress). The case saw Baker accusing Nyeman of failure to practice proper dog-walking etiquette, Nyeman was accused of allowing his dog to poop on his private property resulting in financial damage.

==&quot;Judge Judy&quot; show cast==
===Judge Judy===

Judge Judy Sheindlin was born on October 21, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York, to German-Jewish parents Murray and Ethel Blum.

Sheindlin had gained a reputation for although sporting a &quot;grannyish&quot; lace collar, having a deceivingly tough judicial approach, both in the Manhattan family court and her simulated televised courtroom. Sheindlin also became widely known for her fact-finding process that limited litigants to concise and relevant statements, for litigants to move things along quickly, and forthright interjections that cut through the parties&#x27; attempts at arguments and excuse-making with her. In line with these attributes, her program had been touted as &quot;a show where justice is dispensed at the speed of light.&quot;

Strict in her management of the proceedings, Sheindlin coerced precise compliance with her many courtroom rules and expectations. To that end, Sheindlin was especially sudden with scolding and punishing what she perceived as insolence, disobedience, misbehavior or even annoyance.

As a result of her crusty disposition, volatile temper, and cheeky treatment, taglines such as &quot;Justice with an Attitude&quot; had been used to characterize the program. Sheindlin became known for her regular catchphrases on the program, which became known as &quot;Judyisms&quot;. Some she most commonly used are:
* &quot;The answer is either &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27;&quot;.
* &quot;&#x27;Um/Uh is not an answer,&quot; or &quot;Uh-huh/uh-uh is not an answer,&quot; or &quot;Yep/nope is not an answer&quot;.
* &quot;Shoulda&#x27;, woulda&#x27;, coulda&#x27;&quot;.
* &quot;I don&#x27;t give a rat&#x27;s what you disagree with, sir!&quot;
* &quot;That&#x27;s baloney!&quot;
* &quot;Clearly, you are not wrapped too tight.&quot;
* &quot;That&#x27;s a whole lot of &#x27;&#x27;&quot;.
* &quot;If you tell the truth, you don&#x27;t have to have a good memory.&quot;

Sheindlin used the position of television arbitrator to impart guidance, direction, and life lessons not only to her litigants but her television viewing public at large. An example of guidance often stressed by Sheindlin was to be independent through employment, especially to not live off the government where unwarranted or other people directly where oppression from or friction with the provider may eventuate. In the former, Sheindlin could often be quoted as stating, &quot;No, you aren&#x27;t supporting yourself. Byrd and I [or &quot;We,&quot; as she pointed at herself and Byrd] are supporting you.&quot; Sheindlin had stated that the main message she wanted viewers to take away from her program is that people must take responsibility for their actions and do the right thing.

===Bailiff Byrd===

Petri Adonis Byrd was born on November 29, 1957, in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Byrd had his middle name legally changed to &quot;Hawkins&quot; when he joined the &quot;Judge Judy&quot; program as a salute to his late mother, whose maiden name was also Hawkins. In the program, Sheindlin referred to him simply as &quot;Byrd,&quot; or less frequently &quot;Officer Byrd.&quot;

Byrd took on the role of Sheindlin&#x27;s courtroom bailiff. His main duties in the program consisted of introducing the cases by calling the parties forward and swearing them in, delivering evidence back and forth, and excusing the parties once the case was complete. Full of running gags, Byrd point-blankly disagreed with and corrected Sheindlin in moments when she bounced questions off him for his agreement. He was also noted for his preoccupation with crosswords during the proceedings. In addition, Byrd routinely delivered evidence to Sheindlin while having his head and eye contact directed away from her. A staple of the program, Sheindlin relied on Byrd&#x27;s sophistication and academic knowledge base, with Byrd frequently having to interject in areas to which she struggled: mathematics, new media, social media, current fads and vernacular, etc.

Sheindlin often comically incorporated Byrd amid her critiques and reprimands of litigants, such as by sharing with the parties Byrd&#x27;s disapproving thoughts of them or expanding upon case details, specifically for the benefit of Byrd&#x27;s understanding, without any actual communication at all from Byrd about said litigants or details. Sheindlin has stated &quot;We&#x27;re like two old married people who have reached an accord. I can rely on [Byrd] to be my protector. We don&#x27;t have to exchange words—he knows what I&#x27;m thinking. People who watch us sense we have a history, and that is very important.&quot; Byrd described Sheindlin as &quot;Blunt, witty, and sharp as a tack.&quot; However, when asked if he&#x27;d like to appear as a litigant before her, he answered candidly (laughing), &quot;Hell no. And I don&#x27;t advise any of my friends to do so. Not if they want to maintain their love of the judicial system.&quot;

Byrd has been described by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;the guard dog to the pit bull.&quot;

==Salary, raise non-negotiation, and contract renewals==
By 1999, Sheindlin began earning salaries reflective of her court show&#x27;s success. For every roughly three years from that point forward, Sheindlin handed over her salary wishes to CBS management representatives in a sealed envelope during contract renewals. She communicated her wishes as nonnegotiable, that otherwise she would take her talents elsewhere and produce the program herself.

In early 2000 during the show&#x27;s 4th season, Sheindlin&#x27;s annual salary from &quot;Judge Judy&quot; was reported as $7.8 million. In January 2003 during the 7th season, Sheindlin&#x27;s annual salary was increased to $25 million when she signed a contract to preside over &quot;Judge Judy&quot; through its 10th season (2005–06). For the first time, she was put in the top pay ranks for TV performers. In September 2005, just before Sheindlin&#x27;s 10th season anniversary, it was reported that her contract was extended 2 seasons further, promising the program through its 12th season (2007–08). As part of the deal, Sheindlin&#x27;s annual salary would be increased to $30 million for the then-upcoming 2 seasons. In January 2008 (during show&#x27;s 12th season), Sheindlin&#x27;s annual salary was increased to $45 million when her contract was renewed through the 2013-14 television season (its 17th season).

Her next contract renewal, in May 2011 (during the show&#x27;s 15th season), saw her program extended to the 2014-15 television season (the show&#x27;s 19th) and Sheindlin&#x27;s &quot;Judge Judy&quot; salary increase to its peak of $47 million. Producing vast sums of wealth for CBS, Sheindlin&#x27;s courtroom series brought in $230 million in advertising in 2012 alone. Sheindlin&#x27;s $47 million per year &quot;Judge Judy&quot; salary translated into just over $900,000 per workday (she worked 52 days per year), reportedly making her the highest paid television star in 2013 and 2014.

Sheindlin&#x27;s next &quot;Judge Judy&quot; contract renewal signing with CBS transpired in March 2015 during the 19th season of her program. As part of the annual $47 million contract deal, Sheindlin was furnished ownership of the entire &quot;Judge Judy&quot; episode library (including all past and then future episodes) in exchange for extending the program to its 24th season. The renewal also included a first-look production deal for CBS with Sheindlin&#x27;s television production company, Queen Bee Productions (which produces syndicated courtroom series &quot;Hot Bench&quot;), allowing CBS to have first viewing exposure to any material that her production company engineered.

Sheindlin&#x27;s final contract renewal signing with CBS was in August 2017 (late in the show&#x27;s 21st season), extending the show for one additional season to its 25th. The terms of the agreement also included Sheindlin&#x27;s submission of the &quot;Judge Judy&quot; episode library back to CBS, which has allegedly furnished Sheindlin with an additional annual income of $100 million. The move allows CBS to replay the show (at the time, as many as 5,200 episodes) without limitations on any platform they choose. Before Sheindlin&#x27;s alleged contractual sell of the episode library back to CBS, she reportedly had her team shop the episode library around the entertainment industry for a much higher amount, as much as $200 million annually.

&quot;Forbes&quot; named Sheindlin the highest paid host in November 2018 stemming from her $47 million per year &quot;Judge Judy&quot; salary combined with the annual income from her &quot;Judge Judy&quot; episode library. In 2018, Sheindlin earned $147 million between the $100 million from the alleged sale of the present and then future episode library of her show to CBS, in addition to her $47 million arbitration handling salary. In 2020 and 2021, Sheindlin&#x27;s net worth was reportedly $440 million and $460 million, respectively.

==Reception==

===Nielsen ratings by seasons for series original run (1996–2021)===
1996–1998

When &quot;Judge Judy&quot; launched in September 1996, it went on the air with little media attention and publicity. By the end of October of that year, the show was averaging only a 1.5 rating, putting it in the mid-rank of the 159 syndicated shows on the air. At that time, it was never expected that the show&#x27;s ratings would ever compete with highly successful daytime TV shows of that era, such as &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; and &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;. According to &quot;Biography&quot;″s documentary film on Sheindlin, &quot;Judge Judy: Sitting in Judgment&quot; (aired February 21, 2000), producers of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; were disappointed that the show was barely making it on the radar. However, it did not take long for the court show to pick up momentum as &quot;Judge Judy&quot; rose to a 2.1 rating by the end of that first season. By the starting point of her 2nd season, it was observed that Sheindlin&#x27;s guest presence at public venues had already generated avid recognition and fanfare, her reaction characterized as &quot;overwhelmed by her success, as if it was something she didn&#x27;t expect.&quot; Season 2 (1997–98) of the program saw the court show already rise into the 4 ratings ranges, averaging a 4.3.

The 3rd season (1998–99) of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; was the show&#x27;s first season as the highest-rated program in daytime television, having surpassed the highly rated &quot;Jerry Springer Show&quot; and even then daytime powerhouse &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; for the first time (King World Productions which launched Oprah was folded into CBS Television Distribution in 2007, which distributed &quot;Judge Judy&quot;): the program&#x27;s ratings more than doubled to a 5.6 for that season, marking &quot;Judge Judy&quot; as an early success.

It was due, in part, to this early success that daytime television began to feature more court programming, such as a revival of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; that re-debuted in fall 1997. In 1999, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; moved from Worldvision Enterprises to Paramount Domestic Television, which also distributed her stablemate &quot;Judge Joe Brown&quot; and eventually &quot;Judge Mills Lane&quot;. Many other former judges were given their own court shows in syndication due in large part to Sheindlin&#x27;s popularity. Examples include Greg Mathis, Glenda Hatchett, Alex Ferrer, Maria Lopez, Karen Mills-Frances, Cristina Perez, David Young, and many others. In addition, the series helped to spawn various nontraditional court programs. These include the reality-based revival of &quot;Divorce Court&quot;, which was originally presided over by Mablean Ephriam (1999–2006), Lynn Toler (2006–2020), Faith Jenkins (2020-2022), and currently helmed by Star Jones; the short-lived &quot;Power of Attorney&quot;, capturing various high-profile attorneys arguing cases for litigants in front of Andrew Napolitano; &quot;Street Court&quot;, which took litigation outside of the courtroom; &quot;Jury Duty&quot;, featuring an all-celebrity jury hearing cases presided over by Bruce Cutler; etc. Furthermore, &quot;Judge Judy&quot;″s rise in popularity enabled several non-real life judges to preside over courts, such as Nancy Grace, Larry Joe Doherty, and Gloria Allred.

Also, partly due to Judge Judy&#x27;s popularity, the producers of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; decided to replace Ed Koch with Judy&#x27;s husband, Jerry Sheindlin, as their presiding judge during &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;″s present incarnation 3rd season/overall series 15th season (1999–2000). This meant that husband and wife would be either part of the same afternoon lineup or competing for ratings against each other. The experiment, however, did not last long as midway through &quot;The People&#x27;s Court″s&quot; 4th season (2000–01), Jerry was replaced by the show&#x27;s current judge, Marilyn Milian.

1999–2006

For its 4th season (1999–2000), Judy&#x27;s ratings exploded to its highest for its 25 season lifespan, peaking at a 9.3 rating. At this point, Sheindlin&#x27;s courtroom series was still more than ever the highest rated program in daytime. It was also at this point that &quot;Judge Judy&quot; held a record of increasing its ratings for each successive season since its debut. Because of the program&#x27;s success, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; began airing at better time periods.

It was by the show&#x27;s 5th season (2000–01) that &quot;Judy&#x27;s&quot; streak of growing in ratings from season to season since its debut had ceased. However, the court show still remained the highest-rated program in daytime that season with a 5.6 rating. By the 6th season (2001–02), Judy was no longer the highest-rated program in daytime, beaten out by &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. The court show averaged a 5.0 rating that season. Likewise, for her 7th season (2002–03), she also averaged a 5.0. For her 8th season (2003–04), Sheindlin finally reversed the season-to-season downward turn in her ratings by averaging a 7.1. Of the seven running court shows during the 2004–05 season, most of them earned a 3.63 rating; however, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; remained court genre leader with a 7.5 ratings score for that season (the show&#x27;s 9th). For her 10th season (2005–06), &quot;Judge Judy&quot; averaged a 4.8 rating. &quot;Judge Judy&quot; averaged 4.6 rating for her 11th season (2006–07). Meanwhile, other programs in the genre were trailing Sheindlin from a vast distance: &quot;Judge Joe Brown&quot; averaged a 2.9 rating; &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; averaged a 2.7; &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; averaged a 2.4; &quot;Divorce Court&quot; averaged a 2.0; &quot;Judge Alex&quot; averaged 1.9; &quot;Judge Hatchett&quot; averaged a 1.5; rookies—&quot;Cristina&#x27;s Court&quot; averaged a 1.4, and &quot;Judge Maria Lopez&quot; came in last, averaging a 1.0 rating.

2007–2012

For its 12th season (2007–08), &quot;Judge Judy&quot; averaged a 4.8 rating (4.8 HH AA%/7.4 HH GAA% rating) and 9.9 million average daily viewers. &quot;Judy&quot; was the only first-run syndication program to increase in ratings for that season from the previous, leading CBS to immediately extend her contract through the 2012–13 season. For its 13th season (2008–09), the show averaged a 4.2 rating (4.2 HH AA%/6.5 HH GAA% rating) and 9.02 million average daily viewers. Its 14th season (2009–10) marked the first season in nearly a decade since the 2000–01 season that any daytime television program had been able to surpass &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;″s ratings (&quot;Judge Judy&quot; is also the show in question that during the 2000–01 television season surpassed &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in daytime TV ratings): Judy broke Winfrey&#x27;s near decade-long streak with a 4.4 rating (4.4 HH AA%/6.9 HH GAA% rating) and 9.6 million average daily viewers. It was also at that point that Sheindlin&#x27;s courtroom series became the highest rated show in all of daytime television programming. &quot;Judy&quot; secured this title in its 15th season (2010–11) as the program remained ahead of &quot;Oprah&quot; in her [Oprah] final season and the highest-rated daytime television offering, averaging a 5.11 rating and 9.6 million viewers. During this season, &quot;Judy&quot; also became the highest rated show in first-run syndication. Late that same season in May 2011, as a result of continued high ratings, CBS again extended Sheindlin&#x27;s contract, this time through the 2014–15 season (the show&#x27;s 19th).

In the first post-Oprah television season, the court show continued its reign as the most dominant show in daytime and also became the top-rated show in all of syndication, its 16th season (2011–12) racking up a 7.0 rating and 9.29 million average daily viewers. As the top-rated show in all of syndication at this point, Sheindlin defeated first-run syndication programs and off-network syndication programs (rerun episodes of programs off their original network). The title of overall syndication leader was previously held by off-network syndicated program &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; (2010–11) and before that, first-run syndicated program &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; (2009–10).

&quot;Judge Judy&quot;″s ratings boost in its 16th season and late into the show&#x27;s 15th season was at least partly due to Nielsen&#x27;s change in methodology, in April 2011. This variation benefits programs that air multiple, differing episodes a day. The updated method is totalling ratings points through adding all viewings for each daily episode–even if one of those viewings come from an individual already counted in as having watched another of the show&#x27;s daily episodes. For example, as &quot;Judge Judy&quot; airs two different episodes per day, two ratings points are counted for every one person who has watched both the first and second daily airings. This is as opposed to one person&#x27;s viewing of the two daily episodes amounting to only one ratings point. Prior to the convert, the latest method was only used in GAA numbers, while the previous method was used in average audience measure. Some court shows air in one hour blocks and thus do not benefit at all from the updated method. Worth noting, however, is that shows airing multiple daily episodes may not directly benefit monetarily as the rating system that local stations use to sell to advertisers is based upon the prior method.

2012–2016

For its 17th season (2012–13), &quot;Judge Judy&quot; once again pulled in a 7.0 household rating. The series delivered 9.63 million average daily viewers that season, growing by +32,000 viewers over the prior season. Despite this, &quot;Judy&quot; lost its 1st place spot as the ratings leader in all of syndication that season, descending to 2nd place, only a tad behind &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; (off-network syndicate) which took home a 7.1 for that season. Still and all, this was the 3rd season in a row that &quot;Judy&quot; earned the title of ratings leader in all of first-run syndication. Moreover, this was the 4th consecutive season that &quot;Judy&quot; was the ratings leader in all of daytime television programming. For the 18th season (2013–14), Judy rose to a 7.2 household rating and brought in 9.94 million viewers, gaining 8% over its prior season. Also for this season, the show reclaimed the title as highest rated program in all of daytime (5th consecutive time, 8th time overall) and all of syndication (3rd time). The show&#x27;s 19th season (2014–15) pulled in a 7.0 household rating and remained the highest rated program in both daytime television as well as all of syndication. The 20th season (2015–16) was Judy&#x27;s 3rd consecutive year as syndication&#x27;s top strip, the court show averaging a 7.0 full-season household rating.

2017–2021

For its 21st season (2016–17), &quot;Judge Judy&quot; trounced all of its competitors in daytime and all of syndication. The court show scored a 6.8 household rating for its 21st season. For the 22nd season (2017–18), &quot;Judy&quot; attained a 6.9 live plus same day household average, well ahead of anything else in syndication. It marked the show&#x27;s 5th straight year as the leader in all of syndication ratings and the 9th straight year as the leader in first-run syndication ratings.
For the 23rd season (2018–19), it was reported by Nielsen that &quot;Judy&quot; topped first-run syndication ratings for the 10th straight year with 6.8 household rating. According to Nielsen&#x27;s ratings, the court show finished out its penultimate season (2019–20) at the top of first-run syndication for an 11th straight year, &quot;Judy&quot; taking home a 6.2 household rating. The program&#x27;s closest competitors were &quot;Family Feud&quot; at 6.1, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; at 6.0, and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; at 5.8. Going out on top for its 25th anniversary, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; boasted its 12th year as top Nielsen rated program in first-run syndication, ending its run with an estimated 7.8 million viewers for that final season (2020–21). &quot;Judge Judy&quot; also lasted its entire 25 year first-run as the highest Nielsen rated court show, outperforming all other courtroom series broadcasts and by vast margins.

===Pioneering effect, longevity and accolades===
&quot;Judge Judy&quot;, which premiered on September 16, 1996, reportedly revitalized the court show genre. Acclaiming the program&#x27;s impacts on courtroom television programming, Daytime Emmy Awards Senior Vice President and Executive Producer David Michaels was quoted as stating, &quot;Daytime television wouldn&#x27;t be what it is today without Judy Sheindlin. Judge Judy redefined and reinvigorated the courtroom format propelling the genre to new heights.&quot; Only two other arbitration-based reality court shows preceded it, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; (its first 12-season incarnation canceled in 1993 from low ratings) and &quot;Jones &amp; Jury&quot; (lasting only the 1994–95 season, short-lived from low ratings). Sheindlin has been credited with introducing the &quot;tough&quot; adjudicating approach into the judicial genre, which has led to several imitators.

The only two court shows that outnumber &quot;Judge Judy&quot;″s seasons, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; and &quot;Divorce Court&quot;, have both built longevity on series cancellations/revival reincarnations and multitudes of judge-role recasting moves (in its pre-1999 form, the latter program was scripted via court transcripts of past proceedings). Thus Sheindlin&#x27;s span as a television jurist or arbitrator has lasted longer than any other—a distinction that earned her a place in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; in September 2015. With no cancellations or temporary endings in its series run, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; also had the longest-lasting individual production life of any court show during its entire run. With &quot;Judge Judy&quot; off the air, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;″s current/2nd production incarnation now boasts the longest single production continuance of any court show, having reached 26 seasons by the 2022-23 television year—though having gone through 3 judges during this 26 year production incarnation.

Starring on &quot;Judge Judy&quot; earned Sheindlin a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in February 2006, the Gracie Allen Tribute Award from the Alliance for Women in Media in 2006, induction into &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot;″s Hall of Fame in October 2012, election as vice president of the UCD Law Society in April 2013, and given the Mary Pickford Award by the Hollywood Chamber Community Foundation at the 2014 Heroes of Hollywood.

By 2011, Sheindlin&#x27;s series had been nominated for 14 consecutive years for the Daytime Emmy Award without ever winning. While part of that 14 years had the court show categorized into other television genre categories by the Emmys, it also includes failures to win once the Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Daytime Emmy category was introduced in 2008. By 2012, an article from the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that &quot;Judge Judy&quot; was snubbed by the award show in having never won and not even being nominated into the Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Emmy category that year—despite &quot;Judy&quot;″s status as highest Nielsen-rated court show for its entire series run. In a followup interview with &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; on May 3, 2013, Sheindlin was questioned about the &quot;snub&quot; and her court show&#x27;s failure to ever win up to that point, responding:

On June 14, 2013, however, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; won its first Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program, having received its 15th nomination. The program won again in 2016 and 2017.

===Audience makeup===
&quot;Judge Judy&quot;″s daytime audience was reportedly composed of approximately seventy-five percent women and twenty-five percent men. In February 2014, it was reported that Judge Judy&#x27;s audience was mostly composed of older women, African Americans and Latinos.

===Criticisms===
Despite her widespread acclaim, Sheindlin&#x27;s behavior and treatment of the parties that have appeared before her have often been the subject of criticism. Regular viewers of the program have also been criticized as &quot;sadistic&quot; for their delight in watching Sheindlin engage in her typical behaviors. One such example of criticism has come from the first star of arbitration-based reality court shows, Joseph Wapner. Wapner, who presided over &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; from 1981 to 1993, was a long-time critic of Sheindlin. On November 26, 2002, Wapner criticized Judge Judy&#x27;s courtroom behavior, stating &quot;She is not portraying a judge as I view a judge should act. Judge Judy is discourteous, and she&#x27;s abrasive. She&#x27;s not slightly insulting. She&#x27;s insulting in capital letters.&quot;

Judge Judy replied through her publicist, stating, &quot;I refuse to engage in similar mud slinging. I don&#x27;t know where or by whom Judge Wapner was raised. But my parents taught me when you don&#x27;t have something nice to say about someone, say nothing. Clearly, Judge Wapner was absent on the day that lesson was taught.&quot;

Since then, Wapner has stated, &quot;She is a disgrace to the profession. She does things I don&#x27;t think a judge should do. She tells people to shut up. She&#x27;s rude. She&#x27;s arrogant. She demeans people. If she does this on purpose, then that&#x27;s even worse. Judges need to observe certain standards of conduct. She just doesn&#x27;t do it and I resent that. The public is apt to gain the impression that this is how actual judges conduct themselves. It says &#x27;&quot;judge&quot;&#x27; on the nameplate on the bench and she&#x27;s wearing a robe.&quot;

Sheindlin later stated, &quot;As a young person, when I had watched &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;. . . I said &#x27;you know what, I could do that.&#x27; And at least as well because while Joe Wapner is a very good judge, [he] didn&#x27;t have much of a sense of humor. And I always knew from a very practical perspective that you have to marry those two things in order to be successful in entertainment.&quot;

In a November 2013 interview with Larry King, Sheindlin was asked whether she enjoyed watching Wapner on &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;. She replied, &quot;Meh! Oatmeal!&quot; Following this, King asked her what if any other television judges then did she enjoy, to which Sheindlin answered &quot;Mills Lane&quot; of &quot;Judge Mills Lane.&quot;

===Acclaim===
In a September 2014, &quot;Rickey Smiley Morning Show&quot; interview, Greg Mathis of &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; (second longest reigning court show arbitrator, three seasons behind Sheindlin during her &quot;Judge Judy&quot; series run) was asked what three other court show judges he&#x27;d most enjoy sharing a meal with. For his first choice, he answered (laughing) &quot;Are you kidding?! It would be Judge Judy at the head of the table. Oh my goodness, that Judge Judy is something else.&quot; His second choice was Judge Marilyn Milian, and his third was Judge Mills Lane.

In August 2010, rapper, singer, and songwriter Nicki Minaj stated that one of her favorite television programs is &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and when asked what she likes to do in her spare time, she replied that one of her favorite things to do is watch Judge Judy&#x27;s show.

In February 2013, the head football coach for the San Francisco 49ers, Jim Harbaugh, was asked about the importance of truthfulness and enthusiastically remarked, &quot;Somebody that&#x27;s not truthful? That&#x27;s big to me. I&#x27;m a big fan of the &quot;Judge Judy&quot; show. When you lie in Judge Judy&#x27;s courtroom, it&#x27;s over. Your credibility is completely lost, and you stand no chance of winning that case. So I learned that from her. It&#x27;s very powerful and true. If somebody lies to you, how can you trust anything they ever say after that?&quot;

A couple of months later, Harbaugh would even attend tapings of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; along with his father as audience members. As part of the experience, Harbaugh and his father had lunch with Sheindlin and visited with her both before and after tapings. After meeting Sheindlin and seeing cases in person, Harbaugh stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen Judy adjudicate one improperly. She is so smart. She is so good. I could sit there and watch those cases all day. I really could. It&#x27;s fun to watch somebody that does their job well. I could watch Judge Judy do cases all day. I could watch people play football who do their job really well. People who direct traffic. I get a real kick out of watching people who direct traffic do it. I&#x27;ve done it for hours. I like football the most, but Judge Judy is right up there. She&#x27;s the best.&quot;

Brad Adgate, senior vice president of research for Horizon Media, said &quot;&quot;Judge Judy&quot; is the new Oprah of daytime TV-actually, she was [already] beating Oprah while Oprah was still on.&quot;

While he was President and CEO of CBS Corporation, Leslie Moonves stated, &quot;Over the last few decades, there have been very few shows that have achieved the remarkable success that she has. Not only has Judy sustained that success year after year, how many shows grow in their 15th or 16th year in syndication? She started as a fresh voice and she&#x27;s been a remarkable presence in daytime television ever since.&quot;

Many regular viewers and supporters of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; had defended Sheindlin&#x27;s treatment of the parties that have appeared before her by describing the parties as an &quot;endless parade of idiots&quot; that Sheindlin had to put up with.

==Lawsuits==
&quot;Judge Judy&quot; Executive producer Randy Douthit had been sued numerous times by former staff members of the &quot;Judge Judy&quot; program for alleged wrongful termination, discriminatory practice, mismanagement, etc., while on the job. While only two of those lawsuits went public during the course of the show&#x27;s original run, many other lawsuits and allegations against Douthit were brought to light following the program&#x27;s conclusion.

===Ageism lawsuit===
On November 13, 2007, the show&#x27;s former associate producer Karen Needle was fired. She later sued Douthit, claiming that she was wrongfully terminated because she was too old, 64 at the time. Sheindlin was not named as a defendant. Needle, who helped book audiences for the program, stated the reason she was given for being fired was &quot;unspecified conflict from her audience work.&quot; Needle said she began suffering from back pain, sometimes even resorting to lying on the ground in pain, and when she asked her bosses for a new chair, nothing was done. According to the complaint, two weeks before Needle was fired, she took off four days to assist her ailing 88-year-old mother. Needle later stated, &quot;There is a lot of terrible stuff going on if two people file separate lawsuits (referencing Jonathan Sebastien&#x27;s suit). It&#x27;s a toxic situation over there. This is supposed to be Judge Judy, the voice of justice, and yet her own staff isn&#x27;t treated well. What is she getting paid all that money for if her own staff is treated with such little decency?&quot; The case was dismissed following a jury trial on January 26, 2009.

===Racism termination lawsuit===
On December 26, 2007, Jonathan Sebastien, a former producer of the &quot;Judge Judy&quot; show of seven years, filed a lawsuit against the production company in L.A. County Superior Court for wrongful termination. Sebastien claimed that when he proposed certain cases for the show involving black litigants, Douthit turned them down with his alleged reasons being he did not want to see any more black people; their behaviors were too ghetto and more suited for former television jurist Joe Brown; and they needed more pretty, upscale white people. Sebastien claimed that in January 2007, he objected to the alleged discrimination in a meeting and was verbally abused by Douthit. Three months later on March 30, Sebastien stated he was fired with the reason given that rating numbers were down. Sebastien claimed that the real reason he was fired was that he opposed his boss&#x27;s alleged &quot;discriminatory selection process&quot;. On June 26, 2009, Sebastian filed a request for dismissal with the courts after a settlement was offered to him by the defendant for an undisclosed amount.

===Conspiracy/fraud allegations===
In March 2013, a lawsuit was filed against Sheindlin by Patrice Jones, the ex-wife of Douthit. Jones alleged Douthit and Sheindlin had conspired to permit Sheindlin to buy Christofle fine china and Marly cutlery owned by Jones. She said Sheindlin had paid Douthit $50,815 for the items without her knowledge to deprive her of her valuables, and she sought $514,421 from Sheindlin. The suit ended after Sheindlin returned the tableware to Douthit and Jones agreed to pay Douthit $12,500 and have the tableware handed back to her.

===Copyright infringement lawsuit by production against YouTube user===
On October 17, 2013, Big Ticket Television and the producers of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; filed a lawsuit against Ignacio De Los Angeles for posting an episode of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; on YouTube and ignoring the command to remove it.

===Publicity rights lawsuit filed by Judge Judy Sheindlin===
On March 12, 2014, Sheindlin filed a lawsuit against Hartford, Connecticut, personal injury lawyer John Haymond, and his firm. In the lawsuit, Sheindlin accused Haymond and his firm of using her television image without consent in advertisements that falsely suggested she endorsed him and his firm. In March 2013, Sheindlin&#x27;s producer allegedly told the firm that the use of her image was not permitted, but ads continued. The lawsuit filed in federal court sought more than $75,000 in damages. Sheindlin said in her statement that any money she wins through the lawsuit will go toward college scholarships through the Her Honor Mentoring Program. Sheindlin described the unauthorized use of her name as &quot;outrageous&quot;, stating, &quot;Mr. Haymond is a lawyer and should know better.&quot; Haymond later filed a countersuit for punitive damages and attorney&#x27;s fees, alleging defamation of him and his firm by Sheindlin. Haymond insisted that local affiliates asked him to appear in &quot;Judge Judy&quot; promos to promote Sheindlin for which he obliged. On August 8, 2014, it was reported that the case between Sheindlin and Haymond settled out of court in a resolution that favored Sheindlin. Haymond will be donating money to Sheindlin&#x27;s charity, Her Honor Mentoring Program.

===Contract breach lawsuits by Rebel Entertainment===
On March 14, 2016, talent agency Rebel Entertainment Partners Inc. and its president, Richard Lawrence, filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against CBS Television Distribution, claiming the media giant failed to pay the agency its contractually-agreed-to share of the show&#x27;s profits, totaling millions of dollars. Rebel claimed they were owed for their contributions to launching the program and introducing Sheindlin and CBS through their terminated employees Kaye Switzer and Sandi Spreckman. The lawsuit alleged that CBS hadn&#x27;t paid Rebel for the past six years, claiming that the show operated at a loss primarily due to Sheindlin&#x27;s annual salary boost to $45 and then $47 million. The lawsuit went on to attack Sheindlin&#x27;s salary as being far too high. Rebel described it as &quot;exorbitant&quot; and &quot;grossly inconsistent with customary practice in the television industry&quot; and claimed that similarly successful talk show hosts weren&#x27;t paid nearly as much. Further, Rebel claimed they were entitled to be consulted before any spin-offs of the show were produced, but were not when &quot;Hot Bench&quot; (another courtroom-arbitrated show) was launched by Sheindlin and her producers in 2014. In response to the lawsuit, Sheindlin had stated:

The fact that Richard Lawrence is complaining about my salary is actually hilarious. I met Mr. Lawrence for 2 hours some 21 years ago. Neither I nor anyone involved in the day-to-day production of my program has heard from him in 20 years. Not a card, not a gift, not a flower, not a congratulations. Yet he has somehow received over $17,000,000 from my program. My rudimentary math translates that into $8,500,000 an hour for Mr. Lawrence. Not a bad payday. Now complaining about not getting enough money, that&#x27;s real chutzpah.

When Sheindlin was deposed for the case in the summer of 2016, she said &quot;CBS had no choice but to pay me what I wanted because otherwise I could take it wherever I wanted to take it or do it myself. Their backs to the wall. They pay me the money that they do because they have no choice. They can&#x27;t find another one.&quot;

In an April 2018 verdict on this case, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Joanne O&#x27;Donnell found that Sheindlin was not grossly overpaid and that her salary did not constitute a breach of contract, rather her salary is a result of the &quot;resounding success of her program and without its namesake star would not continue&quot;. That being said, Judge O&#x27;Donnell ruled partially in Rebel&#x27;s favor, agreeing that it was a breach of contract for the defendants to have failed to consult Lawrence before launching the &quot;spin-off&quot; series, &quot;Hot Bench&quot;. Dissatisfied with being granted one part of their motion while denying the other, Bryan Freedman (Lawrence&#x27;s attorney) stated that the plaintiffs intended to appeal Judge O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s verdict. Freedman was quoted as stating, &quot;As for admitting and then ignoring Rebel&#x27;s uncontroverted expert opinion evidence that frontloading the 45 million dollar salary of Ms. Sheindlin was not consistent with the United States television industry, the court committed a reversible error. That issue will be decided by the court of appeal.&quot;

Although CBS attempted to come to a settlement with Rebel Entertainment in February 2020, Rebel issued a second and simultaneous lawsuit in early August 2020 that named not only ViacomCBS as a defendant but Sheindlin as well. The lawsuit filing was for more than $5 million over Sheindlin&#x27;s submitting the show&#x27;s profitable episode library back over to CBS (CBS previously granted Sheindlin the episode library in March 2015 as part of a &quot;Judge Judy&quot; contract renewal deal), Rebel alleging this exchange as a &quot;sell&quot; that they never benefited financially from. That same month, Sheindlin and her attorneys filed a countersuit for $22 million against Rebel Entertainment over unlawful/unfair business practices and unjust enrichment. Sheindlin promised to donate to a cancer charity any money that she won in the lawsuit. In February 2021, Judge Richard Burdge ruled that legal protocols enforced Sheindlin to name CBS as a defendant along with Rebel if she wished to pursue her countersuit. Sheindlin refused and thus her counterclaim was dismissed. On June 12, 2021, it was reported that Sheindlin and her attorneys&#x27; demurrer to have Rebel&#x27;s over $5 million lawsuit dismissed through summary judgment (a verdict rendered early so that a case doesn&#x27;t have to go to trial) was denied by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Patricia Nieto. When asked to share her thoughts about this ruling, Sheindlin remarked, &quot;Richard Lawrence has garnered 22 plus million dollars [from my program], although I have seen him only once in an elevator since our program began 25 years ago. I look forward to a trial&quot;. In September 2022, however, another Los Angeles Superior Court judge, Kristin Escalante, granted a motion by Sheindlin and ViacomCBS to have Rebel&#x27;s two-year-old, over $5 million lawsuit dismissed. Following their court loss, however, Rebel Attorney Freedman remarked on how they intend to keep appealing failed lawsuits until Lawrence gets what he wants.

On July 30, 2021, the California Courts of Appeal upheld Judge Joanne O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s 2018 ruling that CBS did not breach its contract with Rebel by increasing Sheindlin&#x27;s salary to $45 million (and later $47 million), consequently zeroing out Rebel&#x27;s earnings at around the same time in 2009. At the crux of the legal hearing was the contract agreement signed by CBS and Rebel in 1995 when Rebel sold CBS the court show. The contract that was signed outlined that CBS would compensate Rebel 5% of gross proceeds from &quot;Judge Judy&quot; for the duration of its series run, but minus production expenses. CBS contended that profit share deductions were a direct result of production expenses, that is, Sheindlin&#x27;s intent to terminate employment with the network if her salary demands weren&#x27;t met. Sheindlin corroborated these claims in her testimony, stating that she laid down rigid salary terms for CBS every three years otherwise resignation. Accordingly, the court rejected Rebel&#x27;s legal claim and granted CBS a summary judgment, finding that CBS Television Distribution properly deducted profits from Rebel Entertainment as a production expense.

====Added contract breach lawsuit filed by ex-employees of Rebel====
On January 19, 2018, a breach-of-contract lawsuit—similar and loosely related to the case filed by Rebel Entertainment—was filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court against Sheindlin, CBS Corporation, CBS Studios, and Big Ticket Television by Kaye Switzer, and the trust of the now deceased Sandi Spreckman. Switzer and Spreckman are former employees of Rebel Entertainment, terminated by the employer. Switzer and Spreckman&#x27;s trustee, Jay Robinson, claimed they &quot;discovered&quot; and introduced Sheindlin to producer Larry Little, asserting that if not for this move that there never would have been any &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and thus they were owed monetary royalties for the entirety of the court show&#x27;s series run. The lawsuit also claimed that Sheindlin sold &quot;The Judge Judy Library&quot; (a collection of all episodes of &quot;Judge Judy&quot;) to CBS Television Distribution for over $95,000,000. Switzer and the Spreckman&#x27;s trustee contend that they were not paid any monetary royalties by Sheindlin, CBS, or Big Ticket related to this transaction. The two women have a long history of filing lawsuits over the same matter against Sheindlin and CBS dating back to the year 2000.

An insider claimed that Sheindlin was not concerned about the lawsuit, regards the subject of &quot;who is owed what as just background noise&quot;, and believed that the success of her show came from nothing more than the &quot;sweat of her brow&quot; and the force of her personality. According to the same insider, Sheindlin said that while she &quot;was always fond of Kaye and Sandi&quot;, the pair were terminated by Rebel Entertainment before her show ever even made it on the air and that she &quot;never entered a contract with Kaye and Sandi personally.&quot;

In March 2021, defendants Judith Sheindlin, Big Ticket Pictures, Her Honor, and CBS Studios petitioned the courts for a summary judgment (an early verdict from a judge based on enough evidence gathered during discovery so that a case does not have to move to trial). In February 2022, the court granted the defendants their petition for a summary judgment, effectively dismissing the case filed by plaintiffs Switzer and the trust of Spreckman. The defendants contended that the plaintiffs were unable to prove that any money was earned by Sheindlin for her submission of the &quot;Judge Judy&quot; episode library back to CBS, adding that details of the contract regarding that exchange have been kept confidential through contractual protections. To that end, in August 2017 when CBS Television Distribution President at that time, Paul Franklin, shared the news that Sheindlin submitted her &quot;Judge Judy&quot; episode library back to CBS, Franklin was quoted as describing the exchange as CBS &quot;acquiring&quot; the episode library as opposed to &quot;buying&quot; the episode library.

==Series departure details==
In February 2020, CBS attempted to come to a settlement with Rebel Entertainment (despite this, there have been numerous additional failed attempts at winning lawsuits filed against Sheindlin and ViacomCBS by Rebel, even for a period after the show ran). Less than a week after CBS&#x27;s February 2020 settlement attempt with Rebel, Sheindlin announced on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; that her &quot;Judge Judy&quot; series would end that following television year, 2020–21, at 25 seasons. In announcing this news, Sheindlin also shared that she would prepare to shop a new spin-off series, &quot;Judy Justice&quot;, around to other distributors. The news of Sheindlin announcing the end of her series caught CBS off guard. Although CBS had some idea that the show would conclude at around 25 seasons, nothing was set in stone. Sheindlin later signed a deal with Amazon Studios to stream the new &quot;Judy Justice&quot; court show. The deal with Amazon allows Sheindlin full ownership rights over her new program and what was described as a lucrative salary—Sheindlin stated that salary negotiations were effortless because of how public her $47 million &quot;Judge Judy&quot; salary and $440 million net worth (for the year 2020) were. According to later released media reports, Sheindlin&#x27;s annual &quot;Judy Justice&quot; salary is 25 million.

After &quot;Judge Judy&quot; completed its series run at 25 seasons, the program officially ending on July 23, 2021, Sheindlin rationalized that &quot;25 is a good round number&quot; to go out on top with. In June 2021, however, Sheindlin issued public statements that her tensions with CBS and feeling disrespected by the network posed the basis for her show&#x27;s end. According to reports, Sheindlin had taken exception to CBS&#x27;s management of her program ever since the resignation of Les Moonves from the role as chief executive over the network in 2018, resulting from a multitude of scandals. In particular, Sheindlin resented CBS&#x27;s ownership rights to the &quot;Judge Judy&quot; episode library, a position that allowed CBS to air numerous seasons of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; without having to pay Sheindlin as much for new episodes (at least as she had been receiving at that time, which was $47 million annually). Sheindlin further resented CBS&#x27;s demotion of the court show &quot;Hot Bench&quot; in airing timeslots (a series that although does not feature Sheindlin, is produced and created by her).

Addressing her relationship with the network, Sheindlin commented, &quot;We had a nice marriage. It&#x27;s going to be a Bill and Melinda Gates divorce.&quot; In a formal press release response to Sheindlin&#x27;s statements issued by CBS Ventures President Steven Locascio, he was quoted as stating, &quot;The network has had an incredibly successful relationship with Judy over the last 25 years. It has been an honor representing her show, and just like there has never been another Oprah, there will never be another Judge Judy.&quot;

==Post-series run publicity==
===Fan criticism over Bailiff Byrd not returning for &quot;Judge Judy&quot; spin-off===
Sheindlin&#x27;s &quot;Judge Judy&quot; spin-off, &quot;Judy Justice&quot;, garnered significant criticism from disgruntled &quot;Judge Judy&quot; show fans and media outlets alike over &quot;Judge Judy&quot; program&#x27;s Bailiff Byrd not returning to Sheindlin&#x27;s side nor having any participation. According to sources close to Sheindlin&#x27;s programs, the vast majority of her &quot;Judge Judy&quot; crew was invited back and treated well for the successor. Byrd, on the other hand, later revealed in October 2021 that when he finally had a discussion with Sheindlin by the time her new series was in production, she explained that he was due to the show&#x27;s budget, that they couldn&#x27;t afford him. The discussion was also said to have resulted from Byrd having to call Sheindlin. Byrd expressed that he was &quot;dismayed&quot; and &quot;perplexed&quot; as no one had ever previously discussed the new series with him. In a public response to Byrd and &quot;Judge Judy&quot; fans, Sheindlin praised Byrd as &quot;terrific&quot;, sharing that the two had a great 25-season run, but concluded that the new show required a fresh, exciting direction. Byrd ultimately expressed appreciation for the opportunities provided to him by Sheindlin, wishing her all the best with &quot;Judy Justice&quot; and stating to hold no grudges.

Byrd later added in November 2021 that he also felt snubbed by the Emmys when he was not allowed to present Sheindlin&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award to her at the Daytime Emmy ceremony in 2019. Byrd stated that he was seated 15 to 20 rows back while Sheindlin sat with &quot;Judge Judy&quot; Executive Producer Randy Douthit in the front rows. Questioned about the matter, Sheindlin shared that it was Amy Poehler who called up the Television Academy and requested to present her with the award because she was a big fan. According to Byrd, however, Poehler later shared with him that she was equally perplexed over his exclusion from the ceremony.

On April 28, 2022, it was announced that Byrd would return to his televised bailiff duties for another courtroom series, entitled &quot;Tribunal&quot;. Sheindlin created the court show and produces it. Like &quot;Judy Justice&quot;, &quot;Tribunal&quot; is streamed on Amazon Freevee. The program is presided over by now former &quot;Hot Bench&quot; judges, Tanya Acker and Patricia DiMango, along with Sheindlin&#x27;s son, former district attorney Adam Levy.

===Toxic work environment allegations leveled at producer===
While Judge Judy Sheindlin is not accused of any workplace misconduct, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and &quot;Judy Justice&quot; Executive Producer Randy Douthit has come under fire over years of lawsuits and allegations about creating a toxic workplace behind the scenes of &quot;Judge Judy&quot;. Discovered were multitudes of allegations leveled at Douthit by 16 former &quot;Judge Judy&quot; producers that run the gamut, involving workplace drunkenness, sexual harassment, body shaming, ageism, ableism, anti-blackness and misogyny.

According to the allegations made by former &quot;Judge Judy&quot; staff dating back from 2001 through the remainder of the show&#x27;s run, Douthit frequently sexually harassed employees who reported to him and reviled female litigants while directing from the control room, referring to them as &quot;too fat&quot;, &quot;too ugly&quot;, &quot;hos&quot;, uttering pig and cow vocalizations, sharing of which of them he most desired to sleep with, etc. &quot;Judge Judy&quot; Producer Kurstin Haynes revealed, &quot;He&#x27;d make comments about their weight, he&#x27;d make comments about their teeth, or if they were disabled.&quot; According to &quot;Judge Judy&quot; employees, the process of proposing cases to Douthit for his approval required submitting photography of the litigants involved. Several revealed that Douthit was particularly concerned with the teeth of the show&#x27;s guests, employees citing getting into &quot;big trouble&quot; with Douthit over the selection of such &quot;disgusting&quot; litigants. Throughout &quot;Judge Judy&quot;″s run, all lawsuits filed against Douthit were dismissed. However, when questioned about the various allegations, court filings quote Douthit as answering, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe so. I hope not. I may have, but I hope not.&quot;

According to a media publicized lawsuit filed against Douthit in 2009 by former Senior Producer Jonathan Sebastien, Douthit announced, &quot;We&#x27;re not doing any more Black shows. I don&#x27;t want to hear Black people arguing.&quot; Asked whether he remembered telling producers to screen out Black litigants, court filings quote Douthit as answering that he could not recall. After objecting to Douthit&#x27;s behavior, Sebastien was later fired, allegedly for that reason. Sebastien later reached a settlement for an undisclosed amount. In November 2021, six &quot;Judge Judy&quot; staffers confirmed Sebastien&#x27;s claims, additionally alleging that this behavior from Douthit continued through season 25 in 2020-21. Douthit&#x27;s lawyers have denied all charges, claiming that they emanate from disgruntled former employees, also citing Douthit as fostering a supportive, inclusive workplace. Sheindlin&#x27;s leadership was consequently called into question, criticized over turning a blind eye to the matters and allowing Douthit as well as other allegedly problematic &quot;Judge Judy&quot; Executive Producers Amy Freisleben and Victoria Jenest to resume their roles in &quot;Judy Justice.&quot; Expressing resentment over how her leadership was portrayed in media reports, Sheindlin was quoted as stating:
To author a piece which speculates that I &#x27;was untouchable,&#x27; &#x27;don&#x27;t care how the show gets made,&#x27; &#x27;that I don&#x27;t trust anyone,&#x27; &#x27;didn&#x27;t like cases involving dogs, dog bites or strippers,&#x27; &#x27;by and large didn&#x27;t interact with staffers,&#x27; &#x27;wasn&#x27;t worried about the coronavirus,&#x27; is appalling and untrue.

===Success in post–series production reruns===
In April 2022, it was computed that &quot;Judge Judy&quot; reruns have vastly outperformed &quot;Judy Justice&quot; season one (2021–22) in viewership quantities. It was also reported in August 2022 that with &quot;Judge Judy&quot; out of production for over a year by this point, the court show remained one of the highest-rated programs in all of daytime television and syndication. Moreover, the series still dominates the court show genre as the highest-rated broadcast and by significant margins. Questioned about her concluded court show&#x27;s enduring success and timelessness in reruns during a November 2022 interview, Sheindlin answered, &quot;My mind is still blown away by the fact, that in the second year of its afterlife, Judge Judy is still number one in daytime.&quot;

<doc id="466702" wikidata="Q983839" url="?curid=466702" title="Nguyễn Hữu Thọ">
<text>Nguyễn Hữu Thọ (; 10 July 1910 – 24 December 1996) was a South Vietnamese revolutionary and Chairman of Consultative Council of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam from 6 June 1969 to 2 July 1976, and the Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam from 4 July 1981 to 18 June 1987.

Nguyễn Hữu Thọ began his political career in 1949, when he led protests against French colonial rule of Indochina and the patrols of US naval warships off the coast of southern Vietnam. As a consequence of these activities, he was arrested and imprisoned from 1950 to 1952. He went on an extended hunger strike while imprisoned which enhanced his reputation. After the partition of Vietnam into the Soviet-backed communist North Vietnam and the US-backed South Vietnam in 1954, he remained in the south and subsequently co-operated with the government of President Ngô Đình Diệm until he was arrested again for creating an organisation intended on achieving reunification through the proposed elections scheduled for 1956 by 1954 accords.
In 1961, he escaped from prison and became first interim president and then chairman of the North Vietnamese backed National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (Viet Cong), which was co-founded by him on December 20, 1960. This group launched an armed insurgency against the government of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. In June 1969, North Vietnam founded the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam, in which Huỳnh Tấn Phát became President and he himself became Chairman of the Consultative Council. After the North Vietnamese conquest all of South Vietnam following the fall of Saigon in April 1975, he became Prime Minister of new-found Republic of South Vietnam.

After the official reunification of Vietnam and the founding of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam on 2 July 1976, he became one of two vice-presidents and thus a deputy of then President Tôn Đức Thắng. At the same time, he was also the first mayor of Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon, named after dead Ho). After Tôn Đức Thắng&#x27;s death on 30 March 1980, he became acting President of Vietnam, a post he held until he was replaced by Trường Chinh on 4 July 1981.

He then served as Deputy Chairman of the Council of State from 1981 to 1992. From 1981 to 1987 he was also Chairman of the National Assembly (Quốc hội Việt Nam) and thus President of the Parliament. Between 1988 and 1994, he was chairman of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front (Mặt trận Tổ quốc Việt Nam), the umbrella organization for mass organizations in the country.

==Life and career==
A French-educated lawyer in Cochinchina, Thọ was also a member of the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) and a participant in the Vietnamese fight for independence. He joined the Vietnamese National Popular League (or Liên Việt) in 1948, Communist Party in 1949, and was kept in detention from 1950–52. He later came to support the 1954 Geneva agreements, but opposed the government of South Vietnam&#x27;s president, Ngô Đình Diệm. In August 1954, he founded the Committee in Defense of Peace and the Geneva Agreements. The committee was crushed and banned by the South Vietnamese government in November the same year, and Thọ and other members of the organization were jailed after a police raid.

He remained in detention until 1961, when he managed to escape. Free, Thọ became Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front. In 1965, he delivered an anti-imperialist speech, a booklet was later published in English, entitled &quot;SPEECH&quot;. His title was given as: &quot;President of the Presidium of the Consultative Council of the South Viet Nam [sic] National Front for Liberation on the 5th founding anniversary of the N.F.L.&quot; In 1969, he became Chairman of the Consultative Council of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam, a post he retained until South Vietnam was incorporated into North Vietnam in 1976.

In the newly re-unified Vietnam, he served as one of the vice presidents until the death of Tôn Đức Thắng, when he was named acting president (April 1980 – July 1981), a post he held until the appointment of Trường Chinh, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, in July 1981. On relinquishing the post of president, he assumed the role of Chairman of the National Assembly until 1987. He was vice-chairman of the council of state 1981–92. Thọ was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize (1983–84).

Nguyen died on 24 December, 1996 at Ho Chi Minh City at the age of 86.

<text>Unreal Tournament is a first-person arena shooter video game developed by Epic Games and Digital Extremes. The second installment in the &quot;Unreal&quot; series, it was first published by GT Interactive in 1999 for Windows, and later released on the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast by Infogrames in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Players compete in a series of matches of various types, with the general aim of out-killing opponents. The PC and Dreamcast versions support multiplayer online or over a local area network. Free expansion packs were released, some of which were bundled with a 2000 re-release: Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition.

Powered by the Unreal Engine, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; received universal acclaim, often being considered one of the greatest video games ever made, with reviewers praising the graphics, level design and gameplay, though the console ports were noted for having limitations. The design of the game shifted the series&#x27; focus to competitive multiplayer action with the releases of sequels &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot; in 2002, &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; in 2004, and &quot;Unreal Tournament 3&quot; in 2007. In 2014, a pre-alpha version of a new game in the series was released titled simply &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;. In 2017, Epic cancelled the game.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; is an arena first-person shooter, with head-to-head multiplayer deathmatches being the primary focus of the game. The single-player campaign is a series of arena matches played with bots, where the player competes for the title of Grand Champion. The player moves up the tournament ladder in order to challenge the current champion, Xan Kriegor, a mysterious being with exceptional skill. Also available is a practice mode, in which, as its name implies, the player practices a match. Match settings (such as score and time limits) can be customized. Also available are &quot;mutators&quot;, which drastically alter gameplay aspects, such as &quot;InstaGib&quot;, which makes players compete with instant-kill Shock Rifles instead of the normal weapons. Weapons include the Enforcer, the Rocket Launcher and the Ripper, which fires ricocheting blades. Each weapon has two firing modes which have different effects: for example, Rippers can also fire non-ricocheting blades that explode on impact. A special weapon is the Redeemer, which fires a miniature nuke and causes a large and powerful explosion.

Items such as body armor (which reduces damage taken), health packs (which heal players) and damage amplifiers are scattered across levels. Levels are set in a variety of environments, including spaceships, outposts and buildings like castles and monasteries. Many contain features such as elevators (lifts) and teleporters and obstacles such as water and lava. The game is backwards compatible with the majority of &quot;Unreal&quot; multiplayer maps. The PC version includes a level editor in which players can create their own levels, and the PlayStation 2 version supports the use of a USB keyboard and mouse, enabling players to play in a similar manner to the PC version.

For team matches, bots are used to fill the roles of the player&#x27;s teammates. The player can choose the bots&#x27; skill level or have it automatically adjust to the player&#x27;s performance. Bots can be further customized by changing attributes such as names, appearance and weapon preferences. In team matches, players can give orders to bots on their team. The PC version supports multiplayer mode over the internet or a local area network (the original &quot;Unreal&quot; was mainly a single-player game).

=== Game types ===
* Assault: This game type is played with two teams, one assaulting a &quot;base&quot; and the other defending it. The map is set up with objectives which the attacking team must complete (usually in sequence) such as shutting down a power generator, or entering an area. The team who first attacks then defends, and attempts to defend for the entire time they attacked. If they accomplish this, they win. If the team defending first assaults the base faster than the other team, they win. If both teams defend for the maximum amount of time the match is a tie. The Dreamcast version does not feature this mode.
* Capture the Flag: Players compete to capture the other team&#x27;s flag and return it to their base. Competitive teams must use a great deal of teamplay. Both teams must defend the base from incoming attackers and get into the other team&#x27;s base, take their flag and return to base.
* Deathmatch: A classic every-man-for-himself player vs. player combat, the objective is to out-kill all opposing players.
* Domination: Two teams compete to control various control points to earn points. Standard maps contain three control points. Control of these points is initially accomplished through occupation (physically occupying the space), but control of a point continues until a player from another team occupies the space. The first team to reach the point limit, or that has the most points when a time limit has expired, wins.
* Last Man Standing: Similar to Deathmatch, the player&#x27;s objective is to remain alive longer than their opponents, putting an emphasis on number of deaths rather than kills. Players start with all weapons (except the Redeemer) fully loaded and have a set number of lives. Power-ups, including health and ammunition packs, are unavailable. Once a player runs out of lives, they lose.
* Team Deathmatch: Up to four teams compete to out-kill the opposing teams.

Four &quot;bonus packs&quot; were released, each adding maps, characters, or features. For example, Bonus Pack 1 adds &quot;relics&quot; as mutators. Relics are special items that grant a significant advantage to their holder. They include (but are not limited to), the Relic of Vengeance, which creates an explosion when its holder dies, the Relic of Regeneration, which regenerates the health of the holder, and the Relic of Redemption, which makes its holder respawn elsewhere with full health and weapons intact when they would normally die. Bonus Pack 4 adds a new version of Xan Kriegor.

== Plot ==
During the Human–Skaarj war, the New Earth Government was formed. Mining was the primary method of financing the war, but was unpopular with the working class, who grew weary of the working conditions and the war. The humans were losing the war, and riots broke out. The Terran system was surrounded by Skaarj forces, but a government team destroyed their mothership, and the Skaarj withdrew. Afterward, revolts and violence among the mining colonies were on the increase, and efforts to deal with them were unsuccessful. The government then came up with the idea of giving the violence an outlet instead. &quot;Consensual murder&quot; was legalized in the year 2291, enabling people to fight to the death under organized conditions. The Liandri Mining Corporation worked with the government and organized leagues and public exhibitions. Soon, these matches became more profitable than mining, and Liandri formed a professional league to compete in a &quot;Grand Tournament&quot;, the most popular event in the sport. The game takes place in 2341, fifty years after the fights were first legalized.

== Development ==
With a budget of $2 million, using 350,000 lines of C++ and UnrealScript, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; took around a year and a half to develop. When &quot;Unreal&quot; (the first installment of the &quot;Unreal&quot; series) was released in May 1998, it was well received by the press, but it soon became apparent that the quality of the network code used for multiplayer matches was hampering the game&#x27;s further success. In the months following &quot;Unreal&quot;″s release, improving the game&#x27;s multiplayer part became the top priority of the development team. Epic Games started considering an official expansion pack intended to improve the network code while also featuring new maps and other gameplay elements.

The team began work on the expansion in summer 1998, but the task became complicated by Epic&#x27;s organizational structure. During the development of &quot;Unreal&quot;, the team members at Digital Extremes were working in Ontario, Canada, while the members at Epic were based in North Carolina, United States, requiring regular travel to Ontario. To remedy this, Epic decided to centralize the teams in Raleigh, North Carolina, and by September, work on the expansion could begin. Lead programmer Steve Polge set about laying the foundations for the new game types, such as Capture the Flag and Domination, and level designers created the first round of maps for testing. The content grew quickly, and soon the team realized that it had underestimated the task. In November, after a meeting with publisher GT Interactive, Mark Rein suggested releasing the work as a stand-alone game instead of an expansion. The team was reticent at first, but soon accepted the idea, and in December the game became known internally as &quot;Unreal: Tournament Edition&quot;.

The development team for &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; consisted of around 16 people. Most team members had worked on &quot;Unreal&quot;, though Epic hired a number of new developers to reinforce the team. Programmer Brandon Reinhart was one such hire, joining Epic in August 1998 to help with the support of &quot;Unreal&quot; and the development of &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;. That December, Reinhart discovered an &quot;Unreal&quot; mod called UBrowser, which provided a new user interface for finding multiplayer matches. After showing it to James Schmalz, the lead designer at Digital Extremes, Schmalz decided to hire the mod&#x27;s author, Jack Porter. After only a few weeks Porter was already working with the team, replacing the game&#x27;s existing menu system with his new interface. Epic founder Tim Sweeney worked on improving the networking code along with Steve Polge, who also wrote code for AI, player physics and general gameplay. Erik de Neve was responsible for the LOD character rendering, and various extra optimizations.

During the game&#x27;s development, the team lacked artists. The art director at Epic Games, Shane Caudle, and the artists at Digital Extremes could not make enough new textures because of the amount of diversity in characters and maps. To help with the skin and texture production, Epic contracted Steve Garofalo. The game&#x27;s level and content management program, UnrealEd, was written in Visual Basic and considered buggy, but no one had time to fix it. The game engine had an object-oriented design, and the scripting language, UnrealScript, was considered to be more like Java. The modularity of the object-oriented design meant that programmers could make large changes without affecting other parts of the game. Other tools used during development included Microsoft Visual Studio and 3D Studio Max. All of the weapon sound effects were created by Sonic Mayhem. The soundtrack for the game, which employed the system of module files, was written by Alexander Brandon, Michiel van den Bos, Andrew Sega, Dan Gardopee, Peter Hajba and Tero Kostermaa. &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; had support for the EAX Version 2.0 3D positional audio technology by Creative Labs and A3D 2.0 HRTF technology by Aureal Semiconductor out of the box.

In 1999, Epic Games released a playable demo on September 16. This version of the demo was only compatible with Glide-based accelerators. An updated demo version, with support for OpenGL and Direct3D cards, was released on September 28. &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; went gold (became ready for release) on November 16, shipping a few days later on November 22. The Mac version went gold on December 15. The Dreamcast version was developed by Secret Level, who had to drop Assault mode, along with many larger maps, due to the Dreamcast having insufficient memory. A Linux port of &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; was also in development. The goal of the project was to improve the quality of the Linux port of the game as well as strengthen the mod authoring community and teach Epic about open source projects. In 2000, Loki Software made an exclusive agreement with Epic Games to maintain and support the Linux version of &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;, offering new features, addressing any technical issues and achieving revision parity with the Windows version. Bonus Pack 1 was released on February 25, 2000. &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; was re-released in fall (autumn) 2000 as &quot;Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition&quot;, which includes the first three bonus packs and mods such as Rocket Arena, a one-on-one combat mode.

== Reception ==
In the United States alone, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; sold 100,998 copies by the end of 1999, according to PC Data. The game&#x27;s sales in the country reached 128,766 copies, for revenues of $5.42 million, by early 2000. This placed it behind competitor &quot;Quake III: Arena&quot; over the same period. From January through October 2000, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; sold 234,451 units and earned $8.94 million in the region. The game ultimately received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. By November 2001, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;″s total sales were close to 2 million units.

Upon its release, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; received universal acclaim from critics, earning an overall score of 92 out of 100 on aggregate review website Metacritic. Similarly, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; earned an overall score of 94% on the video gaming review aggregator GameRankings. Mainstream press reviews lauded the title for its graphics, gameplay and level design, with &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; calling it &quot;a technical and game-playing marvel&quot;. In March 2000, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; was second on a list of best-selling games in &quot;Computer Dealer News&quot; trade magazine, but the development team believed sales would have been higher if the game was released in October 1999.

Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the graphics, multiplayer gameplay, weapons, and level design. The game was similarly reviewed by &quot;GameSpy&quot;, who stated that the title raised the bar for first person multiplayer games. British magazine &quot;PC Zone&quot; was pleased with the &quot;very intelligent&quot; bots, but criticized the &quot;truly terrible&quot; music. &quot;AllGame&quot; complimented the addictiveness of Assault mode, and the game&#x27;s replay value, calling it &quot;a glowing, shining beacon in a sea of multi-player games&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; found the game to have an &quot;excellent&quot; single-player mode, adding that with an average AI skill the player will &quot;progress with little serious effort, taking a thrilling ride through spectacularly atmospheric levels and increasing numbers of opponents&quot;. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; echoed that sentiment, and commented that the game is playable on low-end systems.

Writing for &quot;GamePro&quot;, Nash Werner said the multiplayer flexibility was &quot;immense&quot;, adding that mutators like low gravity, Sniper Arena and Chainsaw Melee &quot;change everything about the way deathmatch is played&quot;. &quot;Game Revolution&quot; agreed and praised the bots and maps, although it complained that player models were not particularly varied and that the game was not &quot;as visually appealing as the original &quot;Unreal&quot;&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; stated that &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; received the highest ever score at the time of their review, describing the game as nearly flawless. British magazine &quot;PC Gamer&quot; complimented the artificial intelligence, and its American counterpart did the same to the game&#x27;s &quot;gorgeous&quot; graphics and &quot;incredible&quot; editing tools. &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; described the artificial intelligence as &quot;outstanding&quot;, and commented that the Domination and Assault modes add interest. &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;, who rated the game 10 out of 10, praised the &quot;innovative&quot; level design, while &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave it five stars out of five, saying that &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; redeemed both Epic and the &quot;Unreal&quot; franchise to action gamers.

The Macintosh version of &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; was equally praised. &quot;IGN&quot; enjoyed the &quot;perfect&quot; gameplay and multiplayer options, but criticized the high system requirements and the user interface. Nevertheless, the game was described as &quot;the must have title&quot; for Mac. Happy Puppy described the game as &quot;king of deathmatch&quot; due to its &quot;incredible value&quot; gaming and &quot;amazing&quot; variety. &quot;Inside Mac Games&quot; praised the replay value, but criticized the high system requirements. In December 1999, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; was inducted into the &quot;Macworld&quot; Hall of Fame.

Reviewing the Dreamcast version, &quot;Gamezilla&quot; complimented the sound, but criticized the graphics and lack of a plot. Happy Puppy described the game as &quot;intensely fun&quot;, but criticized the &quot;mediocre&quot; sound. &quot;Edge&quot; criticized the lack of Assault mode. The British &quot;Dreamcast Magazine&quot; (not to be confused with the &quot;Official Dreamcast Magazine&quot; or &quot;DC-UK&quot;) was ambivalent to the port&#x27;s gameplay, visuals and sounds, noting its &quot;blasting&quot; action and the removal of online multiplayer from the European version of the game. &quot;GameSpy&quot; cited both slow framerate speeds and low sound quality as problems with the Dreamcast version. Scott Steinberg of &quot;Maxim&quot; rated the game 4 out of 5 stars, labeling it as a &quot;stone-cold killer&quot; that &quot;runs like Carl Lewis on a Jolt Cola binge&quot; while noting its &quot;surprisingly workable&quot; standard game pad controls.

The PlayStation 2 release did not fare as well as the PC and Dreamcast versions. &quot;GameSpy&quot; criticized the graphics of the PS2 version, calling it &quot;uninspired&quot;. Its conclusion said about sluggish gameplay, somewhat washed out colors and textures. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the replayability, and stated that the sound is faithful to the PC version. Gamezilla criticized the PlayStation 2 version&#x27;s lack of multiplayer support compared to the PC version along with &quot;Game Informer&quot;, who said despite its flaws, the game &quot;holds its own as one of the best FPSs out there&quot;. On the other hand, the port scored 3 out of 10 in the television show &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;, with the reviewer lauding the audio and graphics but feeling that the controls could have been better implemented.

In addition to receiving &quot;Eurogamer&quot; first-ever perfect score, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; was named by the site one of the best games of 1999. Launch editor John Bye chose the shooter as the game of the past decade (1999–2009) and said: &quot;&quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; is one of the few games in the early days of Eurogamer that I kept going back to months after I&#x27;d finished reviewing it, a game that I played to unwind after a long day playing other games. Whether it was trying to break the one-minute barrier in the speed running mayhem of Assault mode, battling back and forth amongst the alleyways of Domination, or dropping shrapnel shells at people&#x27;s feet with the wonderfully chunky flak cannon in a fast and furious free-for-all deathmatch, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; was an endless source of entertainment&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; was inducted into the &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; Hall of Fame. &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; was a nominee for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s 1999 &quot;Best Action Game&quot; and &quot;Best Multiplayer Game&quot; awards, which went to &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear&quot; and &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot;, respectively. They called it &quot;a brilliant multiplayer game that blew its main rival &quot;Quake III&quot; away with awesome bots, graphics, game types and online functionality&quot;. &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; was named as a finalist by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences for &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Computer Action Game of the Year&quot;, and won &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Visual Engineering&quot; at the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. The Dreamcast version &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; was a finalist for &quot;11th Annual &quot;GamePro&quot; Readers&#x27; Choice Awards&quot; for &quot;Best Combat Game of The Year&quot;, but lost to &quot;&quot; for Xbox.

In 2011, G4tv included two maps from this game, Facing Worlds and DM-Deck 16, in its list of the &quot;Most Influential FPS Multiplayer Maps Ever&quot;. In 2013, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; labeled the Flak Cannon the greatest gun in PC gaming. In 2014, &quot;Complex&quot; magazine placed &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; as number three on its list of &quot;The 50 Best First Person Shooters Of All Time&quot;, while &quot;Moviepilot&quot; placed it as number two on its list of &quot;The 7 Most Influential Video Games Ever&quot;. In November 2014, &quot;Kotaku&quot; named Facing Worlds the best multiplayer map. In January 2016, Red Bull labeled Facing Worlds one of the 10 greatest FPS multiplayer levels of all time. In July 2016, the game was ranked number 20 on &quot;Bit-Tech&quot; The 50 Best PC Games of All Time.

=== Awards ===
=== Player community ===
Lead designer Cliff Bleszinski credited much of the game&#x27;s success to its community. As he said in the November 2001 issue of &quot;Maximum PC&quot;: &quot;&quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; would not have sold nearly two million copies if it did not have support from the community... We ship the very same tools that we used to build the game, and folks use these tools to realize their own visions of first-person action&quot;. Like &quot;Unreal&quot;, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; is designed to be easily programmable and highly modularized. Through its scripting environment UnrealScript and level editor UnrealEd, developers are able to modify easily most parts of the game to both manipulate default game behavior and to supplement the game with their own mods. These range from slight changes on some aspects of gameplay (such as map voting) to total conversions. One modification, &quot;ChaosUT&quot;, became popular enough that it was included with the &#x27;Game of the Year&#x27; edition of the game, while &quot;Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror&quot; was released as a stand-alone retail product.

&quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; was played at the World Cyber Games in 2001 and 2002.

== Legacy ==
The success of the original &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; spawned four sequels, including &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot; and &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot;, &quot;Unreal Tournament 3&quot; and the cancelled &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; reboot. The yearly naming structure, based around marketing the franchise as a competitive sports title, was abandoned before the launch of the third sequel. &quot;Dark Sector&quot; by Digital Extremes was initially planned as a spiritual successor to &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;. The game was released for free on the Internet Archive in late October 2024.

== Adaptation ==
&quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; is the subject of anthology series &quot;Secret Level&quot;, created by Tim Miller for Amazon Prime Video and released in December 2024. The episode, &quot;Unreal Tournament: Xan&quot;, has the voices of Elodie Yung, Gideon Emery, Mitch Eakins, Chris Payne Gilbert, Carlin James, and Fred Tatasciore.

<text>Maltese dog refers both to an ancient variety of dwarf, white-coated dog breed from Italy and generally associated also with the island of Malta, and to a modern breed of similar dogs in the toy group, genetically related to the Bichon, Bolognese, and Havanese breeds. The precise link, if any, between the modern and ancient breeds is not known. Nicholas Cutillo suggested that Maltese dogs might descend from spitz-type canines, and that the ancient variety probably was similar to the latter Pomeranian breeds with their short snout, pricked ears, and bulbous heads. These two varieties, according to Stanley Coren, were perhaps the first dogs employed as human companions.

The modern variety traditionally has a silky, pure-white coat, hanging ears and a tail that curves over its back, and weighs up to . The Maltese does not shed. The Maltese is kept for companionship, ornament, or competitive exhibition.

== Maltese dogs in antiquity ==
The old variety of Maltese appears to have been the most common or favourite pet, or certainly household dog, in antiquity. Dogs of various sizes and shapes are depicted on vases and amphorae. On one Attic amphora from about 500 BC, excavated at Vulci in the nineteenth century and now lost, an illustration of a small dog with a pointed muzzle is accompanied by the word μελιταῖε, &quot;melitaie&quot;.

Numerous references to these dogs are found in Ancient Greek and Roman literature. Ancient writers variously attribute its origin either to the island of Malta in the Mediterranean, called in Latin, – a name which derives from the Carthaginian city of that name on the island, Melite – or to the Adriatic island of Mljet, near Corfu and off the Dalmatian coast of modern Croatia, also called Melita in Latin. The uncertainty continues, but recent scholarship generally supports the identification with Malta.

In Greece in the classical period a variety of diminutive dog (νανούδιον/&quot;nanoúdion&quot; -&quot;dwarf dog&quot;) was called a Μελιταῖον κυνίδιον (&quot;Melitaion kunídion&quot;, &quot;small dog from Melita&quot;). In its unusual smallness it was variously likened to martens (ἴκτις/&quot;iktis&quot;) or pangolins. The word &quot;Melita&quot; in this adjectival form, attested in Aristotle, refers to the island of Malta, according to Busuttil. The Cynic philosopher Diogenes of Sinope, Aristotle&#x27;s contemporary, according to the testimony of Diogenes Laertius, referred to himself as a &quot;Maltese dog&quot; (κύων.. Μελιταῖος/&quot;kúōn Melitaios&quot;). A traditional story in Aesop&#x27;s Fables contrasts the spoiling of a Maltese by his owner, compared to life of the toilsome neglect suffered by the master&#x27;s ass. Envious of the spoiling attentions lavished on the pup, the ass tries to frolic and be winsome also, in order to enter his master&#x27;s graces and be treated kindly, only to be beaten off and tethered to its manger.

Around 280 BCE, the learned Hellenistic poet Callimachus, according to Pliny the Elder writing in the Ist century CE, identified &quot;Melite&quot; – the home of this ancient dog variety – as the Adriatic island, rather than Malta. Conversely, the poem &quot;Alexandra&quot; ascribed to his equally erudite contemporary Lycophron, which is now thought to have been composed around 190 BCE, also alludes to the island of Melite, but identified it as Malta. Strabo, writing in the early first century AD, attributed its origin to the island of Malta.

Aristotle&#x27;s successor Theophrastus (371 – c. 287 BC), in his sketch of moral types, &quot;Characters&quot;, has a chapter on a type of person who exercises a petty pride in pursuing a showy ambition to be particularly fastidious in his taste (Μικροφιλοτιμία/&quot;mikrophilotimía&quot;). One feature he identifies with this character type is that if his pet dog dies he will erect a memorial slab commemorating his &quot;scion of Melita.&quot; Athenaeus, in his voluminous early 3rd century CE Deipnosophistae (12:518–519), states that it was a characteristic of the Sicilian Sybarites, notorious for the extreme punctiliousness of their refined tastes, to delight in the company of owl-faced jester-dwarfs and Melite lap-dogs (rather than in their fellow human beings), with the latter accompanying them even when they went to exercise in the gymnasia.

The Romans called them . During the first century, the Roman poet Martial wrote descriptive verses to a lap dog named &quot;Issa&quot; owned by his friend Publius. It has been claimed that Issa was a Maltese dog, and that various sources link this Publius with the Roman Governor Publius of Malta, but nothing is known of this Publius, other than that he was an unidentified friend of Paulus, a member of Martial&#x27;s literary circle.

==The Maltese in modern times==
Dog genomic experts state that despite the rich history of the ancient breed, the modern Maltese, like many other breeds, cannot be linked by pedigree to that ancient genealogy, but, rather, emerged in the Victorian era by regulating the crossing of existing varieties of dog to produce a type that could be registered as a distinct breed. The Maltese and similar breeds such as the Havanese, Bichon and Bolognese, are indeed related, perhaps through a common ancestor resulting from a severe bottleneck when a handful of petite canine varieties began to be selected for mating around two centuries ago.

In his work , the first history of its kind, Abbé Jean Quintin, Secretary to the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta Philippe Villiers de L&#x27;Isle-Adam, wrote in 1536 that, while classical authors wrote of Maltese dogs, which perhaps might formerly have been born there, the local Maltese people of his time were no longer familiar with the species.

John Caius, physician to Queen Elizabeth I, writing of women&#x27;s chamber pets, such as the &quot;Comforter&quot; or &quot;Spanish Gentle,&quot; stated that they were known as &quot;Melitei&quot; hailing from Malta, though the species he describes were actually Spaniels, perhaps of the recently imported King Charles Spaniel type. A variation of the latter was the Blenheim toy dog, bred by the Marlborough family, with its distinctive white and chestnut mantle. Red and white mantled varieties of these toy pets, the King Charles or Oxfordshire Blenheim breeds, were all the fashion in the 17th.century, down through the early decades of the 19th.century.

In 1837 Edwin Landseer painted &quot;The Lion Dog from Malta: The Last of his Tribe&quot;, a portrait of a dog named Quiz, a petite flossy white creature poised next to a huge Newfoundland dog, commissioned by Queen Victoria as a birthday present for her mother, the Duchess of Kent, whose dog it was. According to John Henry Welsh, shortly after Landseer&#x27;s canvases, the London &quot;fancy&quot; of toy dog enthusiasts took to importing exemplars of the Chinese spaniel, with their short faces and snub noses, and crossbred these with pugs and bulldogs to select for puppies with a longer &quot;feather&quot; or fleecing on their ears and limbs. Some time later, the London market began to deal in what were called &quot;Maltese&quot; dogs. These had no known connection to that island, and one of the breeders, T. V. H. Lukey, associated with the English mastiff, stated that his own Maltese strain was imported from the Manilla Islands in 1841.

A strain of this type was accepted as a distinct class at the Agricultural Hall Show in Islington in 1862, when a breeder, R. Mandeville, took first prize and continued to do so in subsequent years. From 1869 to 1879, Mandeville swept the board of most shows in Birmingham, Islington, the Crystal Palace, and Cremorne Gardens, and his kennels were considered to have furnished the finest strain for subsequent Maltese breeding. From the 19th. century onwards, the requirement emerged for the Maltese to have an exclusively white coat. Despite the unknown provenance, by the close of the century, the dog-expert William Drury noted that nearly all English writers of that period associated the breed with Malta, without adducing any evidence for the claim.

A white dog was shown as a &quot;Maltese Lion Dog&quot; at the first Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York City in 1877. From that time they were occasionally crossed with poodles, and a stud book, based on the issue of two females, was established in 1901. By the 1950s, this registry counted roughly 50 dogs in its pedigree table. The Maltese was recognised as a breed by the American Kennel Club in 1888. It was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale under the patronage of Italy in 1955.

== Characteristics ==
The coat is dense, glossy, silky and shiny, falling heavily along the body without curls or an undercoat. The colour is pure white, however a pale ivory tinge or light brown spotting is permitted. Adult weight is usually . Females are about tall, males slightly more. They behave in a lively, calm, and affectionate manner.
The Maltese does not shed. Like other white dogs, they may show tear-stains.

The breed may be prone to health problems such as liver and heart issues, and Luxating patella. They should be checked for conditions like &quot;Patent Ductus Arteriosus&quot;.

Of note, the breed is also highly recommended for those with dog allergies, as the breed is considered hypoallergenic. Hence, some people with dog allergies may be able to tolerate living with a Maltese as they shed less fur.

== Use ==
The Maltese is kept for companionship, for ornament, or for competitive exhibition. It is ranked 59th of 79 breeds assessed for intelligence by Stanley Coren.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.1 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. A 2024 Italian study found a life expectancy of 11 years for the breed compared to 10 years overall.

<text>The hundredweight (abbreviation: cwt), formerly also known as the centum weight or [[quintal]], is a British imperial and United States customary unit of weight or mass. Its value differs between the United States customary and British imperial systems. The two values are distinguished in American English as the short and long hundredweight and in British English as the cental and imperial hundredweight.

* The short hundredweight or cental of is defined in the United States customary system.
* The long or imperial hundredweight of 8 stone or is defined in the British imperial system.

Under both conventions, there are 20 hundredweight in a ton, producing a &quot;short ton&quot; of 2,000 pounds (907.2 kg) and a &quot;long ton&quot; of 2,240 pounds (1,016 kg). 

==History==
The hundredweight has had many values. In England in around 1300, different hundreds (&quot;centum&quot; in Medieval Latin) were defined. The Weights and Measures Act 1835 formally established the present imperial hundredweight of .

The United States and Canada came to use the term &quot;hundredweight&quot; to refer to a unit of . This measure was specifically banned from British use—upon risk of being sued for fraud—by the Weights and Measures Act 1824 (5 Geo. 4. c. 74), but in 1879 the measure was legalised under the name &quot;cental&quot; in response to legislative pressure from British merchants importing wheat and tobacco from the United States into the United Kingdom.

==Use==
The short hundredweight is commonly used as a measurement in the United States in the sale of livestock and some cereal grains and oilseeds, paper, and concrete additives and on some commodities in futures exchanges.

A few decades ago, commodities weighed in terms of long hundredweight included cattle, cattle fodder, fertilizers, coal, some industrial chemicals, other industrial materials, and so on. However, since the increasing usage of the metric system in most English-speaking countries, it is now used to a far lesser extent. Church bell ringers use the unit commonly, although church bell manufacturers are increasingly moving over to the metric system .

Older blacksmiths&#x27; anvils are often stamped with a three-digit number indicating their total weight in hundredweight, quarter-hundredweight (, abbreviated qr), and pounds. Thus, an anvil stamped &quot;1.1.8&quot; will weigh ( + + ).
The same three part scheme is used for church bells (formatted cwt–qr–lb).

The long hundredweight is used as a measurement of vehicle weight in the Bailiwick of Guernsey. It was also previously used to indicate the maximum recommended carrying load of vans and trucks, such as the Ford Thames 5 and 7 cwt vans and the 8, 15, 30 and 60 cwt Canadian Military Pattern trucks.

== Europe ==

In Europe outside the British Isles, a centum or quintal was never defined in terms of British units. Instead, it was based on the kilogramme or former customary units. It is usually abbreviated q. It was in Germany, in France, in Austria, etc. The unit was phased out or metricized after the introduction of the metric system in the 1790s, being occasionally retained in informal use up to the mid-20th century.

<text>David Weiss Halivni (; September 27, 1927 – June 28, 2022) was a European-born American-Israeli rabbi, scholar in the domain of Jewish sciences, and Professor of Talmud. He served as &quot;Reish Metivta&quot; of the Union for Traditional Judaism&#x27;s rabbinical school.

==Biography==
David Weiss was born on September 27, 1927, in Kobyletska Poliana (Кобилецька Поляна, Poiana Cobilei, Gyertyánliget) in Carpathian Ruthenia, then in Czechoslovakia (now in Rakhiv Raion, Ukraine). His parents separated when he was 4 years old, and he grew up in the home of his maternal grandfather, Rabbi Isaiah (Shaye) Weiss, a Hasidic Talmud scholar in Sighet, Romania. 

His grandfather began teaching him at age 5, and he was regarded as a prodigy; he received semicha (rabbinic ordination) at age 15 from Rabbi Yekutiel Yehuda Gross of the town&#x27;s yeshiva.

In March 1944, German troops arrived in Sighet to deport the town&#x27;s Jewish population to concentration camps. Weiss, then 16 years old, was sent to Auschwitz along with his grandfather, mother, and sister; his father, Ephraim Bezalel Viderman, was murdered by the Nazis elsewhere. The remaining members of his family at Auschwitz were murdered, leaving Weiss as the sole survivor of his family at age 16. One week after he arrived at Auschwitz, Weiss transferred to the forced labor camps at Gross-Rosen, Wolfsberg, and then Mauthausen, where he worked in a munitions plant.

When he arrived in the United States at the age of 18 after his liberation, he was placed in a Jewish orphanage, where he created a stir by challenging the kashrut of the institution. A social worker introduced him to Rabbi Saul Lieberman, a leading Talmudist at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) in New York, who recognized his brilliance and took him under his wing. Weiss later studied with Lieberman for many years at the JTS.

Initially, he studied in Yeshiva Chaim Berlin under Yitzchak Hutner and was allowed to forgo lectures because of his advanced standing. Over the next decade, he completed high school; earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy from Brooklyn College; a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy from NYU, and his doctorate in Talmud at JTS.

He married Zipporah Hager, a descendant of the Vizhnitzer Rebbes, in 1953, and the couple settled in Manhattan. They had three children: Baruch (Bernard), Ephraim, and Yeshiahu. Halivni had six grandchildren: Avidan, Hadar, Daniel, Rebecca, Benjamin (Jamin), and Eliana.

Weiss, which is German for &quot;white&quot;, later changed his name to &quot;Halivni,&quot; the Hebrew word for &quot;white&quot;. He died on June 18, 2022, at his home in Jerusalem at the age of 94.

==Academic career== 
For many years he served as a Professor of Talmud at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS). He resigned in 1983. Halivni later served as Littauer Professor of Talmud and Classical Rabbinics in the Department of Religion at Columbia University. In July 2005, he retired from Columbia University and moved to Israel, where he taught at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Bar Ilan University until his death.

Halivni&#x27;s &quot;source-critical approach&quot; to Talmud study had a major impact on academic understanding and study of the Talmud. The traditional understanding viewed the Talmud as a unified homogeneous work. While other scholars had also treated the Talmud as a multi-layered work, Halivni&#x27;s innovation (primarily in the second volume of his &quot;Mekorot u-Mesorot&quot;) was to distinguish between the attributed, statements, which are generally succinct rabbinic law (Halakhic) opinions or inquiries attributed to known Amoraim, and the anonymous statements within a given sugya (Talmudic passage). A sugya consists of a longer elaboration or analysis, often consisting of dialectic discussion that Halivni attributed to the later authors - &quot;Stamma&#x27;im&quot; (or Savora&#x27;im). It has been noted that indeed the Jerusalem Talmud is very similar to the Babylonian Talmud, minus Stammaitic activity, which is to be found only in the latter.

His methodology of &quot;source-critical analysis&quot; of the Talmud is controversial among most Orthodox Jews, but is accepted in the non-Orthodox Jewish community, and by some within Modern Orthodoxy. Halivni terms the anonymous texts of the Talmud as having been said by &quot;Stammaim&quot; (based on the phrase &quot;stama d&#x27;talmuda&quot; which refers to the anonymous material in the Gemara), who lived after the period of the Amoraim, but before the Geonic period. He posits that these &quot;Stammaim&quot; were the recipients of terse Tannaitic and Amoraic statements and that they endeavored to fill in the reasoning and argumentative background to such apodictic statements.

The methodology employed in his commentary &quot;Mekorot u&#x27; Mesorot&quot; (Hebrew: מקורות ומסורות) attempts to give Halivni&#x27;s analysis of the correct import and context and demonstrates how the Talmudic &quot;Stammaim&quot; often erred in their understanding of the original context.

In Halivni&#x27;s books &quot;Peshat and Derash&quot; and &quot;Revelation Restored&quot;, he attempts to harmonize biblical criticism with traditional religious belief using a concept he developed termed &quot;Chate&#x27;u Israel&quot; (literally, &quot;Israel has sinned&quot;). This concept states that the biblical texts originally given to Moses have become irretrievably corrupted. &quot;Revelation Restored&quot; writes as follows:

According to the biblical account itself, the people of Israel forsook the Torah, in the dramatic episode of the golden calf, only forty days after the revelation at Sinai. From that point on, until the time of Ezra, the scriptures reveal that the people of Israel were steeped in idolatry and negligent of the Mosaic law. Chate&#x27;u Yisrael states that in the period of neglect and syncretism after the conquest of Canaan when the originally monotheistic Israelites adopted pagan practices from their neighbours, the Torah of Moses became &quot;blemished and maculated&quot;.

According to Halivni, this process continued until the time of Ezra (c.450 BCE), whereupon their return from Babylon the people accepted the Torah. It was at that time that the previously rejected, and therefore maculated, text of the Torah was recompiled and edited by Ezra and his &quot;entourage.&quot; He claims that this is attested in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, and Halivni supports his theory with Talmudic and Midrashic sources which indicate that Ezra played a role in editing the Torah. He further states that while the text of the Pentateuch was corrupted, oral tradition preserved intact many of the laws, which is why the Oral Law appears to contradict the Biblical text in certain details.

This view was seen as possibly being in contradiction to the 8th of Maimonides&#x27; 13 principles of faith, which states &quot;the Torah that we have today is the one that was dictated to Moses by God&quot;. As a result, Halivni&#x27;s assertions were rejected by some Orthodox rabbis.

==Views and opinions==
Halivni was involved in the 1983 controversy at JTS surrounding the training and ordination of women as rabbis. He felt that there could be halakhic methods for ordaining women as rabbis but more time was needed before this could be legitimately instituted. He maintained that it was a policy decision by the governing body of the Seminary rather than a &quot;psak halachah&quot; based on the traditional rabbinic legal process. 

==Published works==
Halivni&#x27;s published works include:
*&quot;Mekorot u&#x27;Mesorot&quot; (Hebrew: מקורות ומסורות). Commentary on the Talmud. It currently contains 10 volumes: 1. Introductions, 2. Shabbat, 3. Eruvin and Pesahim, 4. Yoma-Hagigah, 5. Seder Nashim, 6. Bava Kamma, 7. Bava Mezia, 8. Bava Batra, 9. Sanhedrin, Makkot, Shevuot, Avodah Zarah, Horayot, 10. (posthumous) Zevahim, Menahot, Hullin.

*&quot;Peshat and Derash&quot; : plain and applied meaning in Rabbinic exegesis. Oxford, England : Oxford University Press, 1991.
*&quot;Revelation Restored&quot; : divine writ and critical responses. Boulder, Colo : Westview Press, 1997.
*&quot;The Book and the Sword&quot; : a life of learning in the shadow of destruction. New York : Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1996. His memoirs.
*&quot;Breaking the Tablets: Jewish Theology After the Shoah&quot;. Lanham : Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, ©2007. A collection of essays on Holocaust theology.

The central thesis of &quot;Breaking the Tablets&quot; is that the history of the Jews is &quot;bookmarked&quot; by two diametrically opposing &quot;revelations&quot;: Sinai and Auschwitz. The revelation on Mount Sinai was the apex of God&#x27;s nearness to the Jews, while the revelation at Auschwitz was the nadir of God&#x27;s absence from them. Halivni&#x27;s conviction is that Auschwitz represents not merely God&#x27;s &quot;hiding his face&quot; from Israel, as a consequence of the Jews&#x27; sins — a familiar trope in rabbinic theology — but also his actual, ontological withdrawal from human history.

In &quot;Breaking the Tablets&quot; Halivni explicitly rejected the notion that this withdrawal is simply an example of &quot;God hiding his face&quot; as viewed in normative Judaism. The concept of &quot;hester panim&quot; (God&#x27;s hiding his face) is classically used with regard to punishment, and Halivni is adamant that the Holocaust cannot in any way be regarded as a punishment for Israel&#x27;s sins.

==Awards and recognition==
* In 1985, Halivni was a co-recipient (jointly with Hillel Barzel and Shlomo Pines) of the Bialik Prize for Jewish thought.
*In 1997, he won awarded the National Jewish Book Award in Scholarship for &quot;Revelation Restored: Divine Writ and Critical Responses&quot;
* In 2008, he was awarded the Israel Prize for his Talmudic work.

<doc id="466728" wikidata="Q1191885" url="?curid=466728" title="Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan">
<text>The is an aquarium located in the ward of Minato in Osaka, Osaka Prefecture, Japan, near Osaka Bay. When it first opened, it was the largest public aquarium in the world. 

It is a member of the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums, and the aquarium is accredited as a Museum-equivalent facilities by the Museum Act from Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.

The aquarium is about a five-minute walk from Osakako Station on the Osaka Municipal Subway Chūō Line, and is next to the Tempozan Ferris Wheel.

==History==
In 1988, with the aim of redeveloping the Osaka Bay Area, the Kaiyukan and Tempozan Marketplace were to be built following the success stories of aquariums and commercial facilities overseas. The aquarium was named &quot;Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan&quot; by the general public and opened in 1990.The number of visitors reached 1 million on the 40 days of the opening and 2 million on the 101 days, The final number of visitors during the year reached 5.6 million, surpassing the national record held at that time Tokyo Sea Life Park and being the fastest record in Japan.

The number of visitors reached 50 million on February 26, 2008. Achievement in 6317 days (about 18 years) is the fastest among aquariums in Japan, and about 60% of the visitors are repeaters. In 2014, the total number of visitors exceeded 65 million. This record was the best in Japan, surpassing that of Toba Aquarium. 

In 2017, the number of visitors reached 75 million, making it the most visited aquarium in Japan. A ceremony was held in 2024 to celebrate the achievement of 85 million total visitors.

==Exhibits==
Visitors will go up to the eighth floor on the escalator, passing through the Aqua Gate, a tunnel tank with various tropical fish. After exiting the escalator is the Japan Forest, which recreates a Japanese forest and holds Asian small-clawed otters, Japanese giant salamanders, black-crowned night herons and many other native freshwater animals.

The walk-through aquarium displays marine life in several habitats comprising 27 tanks in 16 main exhibits with a total volume of 10,941 tons of water. The habitats are from the Ring of Fire area of the Pacific Ocean and these include the Aleutian Islands (tufted puffins), Monterey Bay (California sea lions and largha seals), Gulf of Panama (ring-tailed coati, long-spine porcupinefish and blotcheye soldierfish), Ecuador Rain Forest (arapaima, red-bellied piranhas, capybara &amp; green iguanas), Antarctica (Adélie, gentoo &amp; king penguins), Tasman Sea (Pacific white-sided dolphins) and Great Barrier Reef (palette surgeonfish, pennant coralfish &amp; threadfin butterflyfish), Seto Inland Sea (common octopus, Japanese spiny lobster &amp; red seabream), Coast of Chile (Japanese anchovies and South American pilchards), Cook Sea Strait (loggerhead sea turtles, deepwater burrfish &amp; scarlet wrasse), Japan Deeps (Japanese spider crabs, elephant fish &amp; Hilgendorf&#x27;s saucord) and a jellyfish gallery (moon jellyfish &amp; northern sea nettle). The Aqua Gate at the entrance and the Jellyfish corner are new facilities built in 1998.

The largest tank is the Pacific Ocean tank which is has a maximum length of , a depth of and holds of water and a variety of fish including Indian mackerel, Pacific bluefin tuna, reef manta rays, scalloped hammerhead sharks and two whale sharks.

The most popular animals on display are the whale sharks. Osaka aquarium is the second aquarium in the world after Okinawa Ocean Expo Aquarium to start keeping whale sharks. In 1994 the aquarium successfully captivated a manta ray which was the second in the world at the time. Later in 1995 the aquarium managed to successfully hold an ocean sunfish in captivity. Becoming one of the few aquariums in the world to have this fish. Due to its comically large size and shape, it is reported to be a more popular exhibit at the aquarium than whale sharks.

The &quot;New Interactive Area&quot; that opened in 2013 allows visitors to see the animals up close and possibly touch them. In the &quot;New Interactive Area&quot;, 3 zones are constructed, the Arctic Zone, in which visitors see ringed seals, Falkland Islands Zone, where they can see southern rockhopper penguins, and the Maldives Zone, in which they can directly touch stingrays and small sharks like brownbanded bamboo sharks and coral catsharks.

In 2020, the museum shop was reopened on February 22 after renewal work was carried out to coincide with the 30th anniversary of its opening.

The music used at Kaiyukan changes with the time of day, but these are all from the &quot;Acoustic Cafe Underwater Walk&quot; album.

== Research and conservation ==

Osaka Aquarium are focusing on research on sharks and Rays. By 2016, Kaiyukan had successfully captivity or breeding 47 species of sharks, 37 species of rays, and 1 species of ghost shark, for a total of 85 species. In addition, the past eight surveys of tagging whale sharks have revealed that they can migrate to the Philippines and dive to a depth of .　

The aquarium has been breeding and studying Giant Devil Rays since 2008. &quot;OBIC&quot; devil rays were trained for health management for transportation to the Pacific Tank, and a large 8-meter-diameter tank was set up on the deck of the ship,
The giant devil rays were transported over a long distance from Kochi Prefecture to Osaka under conditions that allowed them to swim freely.

At the aquarium, giant devil rays became pregnant in 2022. It was the first time in the world that a giant devil ray was conceived in captivity. After the pregnancy was discovered, regular ultrasound examinations were used to check the growth of the fetus and to record changes in the mother&#x27;s abdomen bulge and behavior. In addition, to protect the baby after birth, a partition net was set up in the tank in preparation for the birth. 

The baby was born on the morning of May 16, and although the birth was celebrated with great fanfare, the puppies soon died. They swam unsteadily and weakly and died at 16:18. Based on the results of the pathological autopsy and blood tests, the cause of death was considered to be due to an imbalance of blood due to physical exhaustion from not being able to swim.
In addition, since the opening of the Osaka Aquarium, it has succeeded in breeding Spotted Seal, Pelagic stingray, California Sealion, Sea otter, etc., and received the breeding award from the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums. aquariums also focusing on breeding and cultivation other than aquatic organisms, and in 1993, aquariums received the breeding award from the association for the first successful breeding of the spur-winged lapwing in Japan. In addition, about 200 species of plants are exhibited in the Japanese forest area inside the building.

===Research center &quot;OBIC&quot; ===
Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan has a research center &quot;Osaka Aquarium Biological Research Institute of Iburi Center (OBIC)&quot; in Iburi, Kochi Prefecture, where fish swimming tests and animals to be brought in are carried out in tanks with a water volume of and a water volume of . 

There are also several offshore fish farms off the coast of OBIC that conduct research on Ocean sunfish and other species. although it was not exhibited at the aquarium, they succeeded in captivity of Pelagic thresher for 26 days at the offshore fish farms in Iburi, Kochi Prefecture. Other captivity such as Chilean devil ray, which has not been recorded since Georgia Aquarium captivity in Taiwan, was also successful at the tank in OBIC.

It also conducts joint research with Kyoto University and Kochi University and, with the cooperation of local residents, conducts underwater biological surveys of marine life and fish species in the surrounding waters. 

In 2001, the aquarium published a research book at the OBIC, publishing the knowledge accumulated by the Osaka aquarium over 10 years on 567 species of fish in 136 families. The research book later received the Kochi Prefecture Academic Publishing Award. The OBIC is not open to the public, but the interior is sometimes opened to the public for events.

OBIC celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2017 and held a 20th anniversary event on July 29. 

Research and conservation will be reported in Bulletin &quot;kaiyu(かいゆう)&quot;.

==Architecture and name ==

The Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan&#x27;s conceptual design, architecture, and exhibit design was led by Peter Chermayeff of Peter Chermayeff LLC while at Cambridge Seven Associates. Peter Chermayeff also built the Lisbon Oceanarium and other buildings.

The three color schemes that characterize the exterior of the building mimic the union of earth, water, and fire. The fish mural on the exterior wall was painted by Serge Chermayeff, an English designer living in the United States, and the entire building was designed by his son Peter, who headed the Cambridge Seven Associates Environmental Development Institute.

Visitors first take an escalator up to the 8th floor, and then go down a corridor to the 4th floor. The first three floors are machine rooms containing filtration equipment and are not open to the public.

Unlike the usual method of filling and unloading the tank (filling from the water surface and unloading from the bottom), the water is filled from the bottom of the tank and unloaded from the top. This is to make it easier to collect leftover food and feces floating in the tank by creating a water flow from the bottom to the top, and to increase the clarity of the water. Oxygen is supplied by creating artificial waterfalls. Most of the waterfalls are located behind the tanks, but some are visible to visitors for Production.

The tanks used in the aquarium are made of of acrylic glass. The largest single pane measures six meters by five meters by thirty centimeters and weighs roughly 10 tons. At the thicknesses used, regular glass would be unwieldy and would not have the desired transparency.　 About 100 acrylic panels were used to build the tank, which was produced by four companies: Mitsubishi Rayon, Nippura, Sumitomo Chemical, and Reynolds Group Holdings of the United States.

TV personality Emiko Kaminuma states that it is her role to decide the name &quot;海遊館 Kaiyukan&quot; in Japanese. Kaminuma, who was a member of the name selection committee among the common candidates starting from Marine, chose Kaiyukan, which had only one vote, and said, &quot;It is better to make it an impactful &quot;Kaiyukan&#x27;&quot;. Emiko Kaminuma said, &quot;There is no impact with a mundane name that starts with Marine. 

If it is expressed in three kanji characters, the meaning will be easier to understand, and it will have an easy-to-understand impact like (夢工場).&quot; As a result, it does not have a name starting with Marine, which had a large number of votes, but was named Kaiyukan.

<text>The Convair XC-99, AF Ser. No. &quot;43-52436&quot;, is a prototype heavy cargo aircraft built by Convair for the United States Air Force. It was the largest piston-engined land-based transport aircraft ever built, and was developed from the Convair B-36 Peacemaker bomber, sharing the wings and some other structures with it. The first flight was on 24 November 1947 in San Diego, California, and after testing it was delivered to the Air Force on 26 May 1949. The Convair Model 37 was a planned civil passenger variant based on the XC-99 but was not built.

==Design and development==
Design capacity of the XC-99 was of cargo or 400 fully equipped soldiers on its double cargo decks. A cargo lift was installed for easier loading. The engines face rearward in a pusher configuration.

===Planned civil passenger variant===
The Convair Model 37 was a large civil passenger design derived from the XC-99 but was never built. The Model 37 was to be of similar proportions to the XC-99; length, wingspan, and a high-capacity, double-deck fuselage. The projected passenger load was to be 204, with an effective range of .

Fifteen aircraft were ordered by Pan American Airways for transatlantic service. However, the fuel and oil consumption of the six Wasp Major radials powering the XC-99 and B-36 meant that the design was not economically viable, and the hoped-for turboprop powerplants did not materialize fast enough. The low number of orders was not sufficient to initiate production, and the project was abandoned.

==Operational history==

In July 1950, the XC-99 flew its first cargo mission, &quot;Operation Elephant.&quot; It transported of cargo, including engines and propellers for the B-36, from San Diego to Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, a record it would later break when it lifted from an airfield at elevation. In 1951, the aircraft was retrofitted with 3,800hp Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360-53 engines, landing gear was strengthened and a cargo-loading system installed, including an internal elevator. Bins were developed to enable quick loading of the aircraft - it was estimated the aircraft could be loaded in as little as 30 minutes.

In August 1953, the XC-99 would make its longest flight, , to Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany, by way of Kindley Air Force Base, Bermuda and Lajes Field in the Azores. It carried more than each way. It attracted much attention everywhere it flew. The US Air Force determined that it had no need for such a large, long-range transport at that time, and no more were ordered. The sole XC-99 served until 1957, including much use during the Korean War. It made twice weekly trips from Kelly AFB to the aircraft depot at McClellan Air Force Base, California, transporting supplies and parts for the B-36 bomber while returning by way of other bases or depots making pick-ups and deliveries along the way.

==Retirement and preservation==
The aircraft was put on display at Kelly AFB near San Antonio, Texas, in 1957. Deterioration of the airframe due to the high magnesium content was beyond local abilities to address. The aircraft was later moved to a grassy field near the base and in 1993 the USAF moved it back to the Kelly AFB. In 1995, Kelly AFB was identified for closure via BRAC, although some portions would remain under USAF control as the Kelly Field Annex to adjacent Lackland AFB, it was deemed that a new location be identified for the XC-99.

Disassembly of the aircraft began at Kelly Field in April 2004 and the airframe was moved in pieces from Kelly to the National Museum of the United States Air Force (NMUSAF) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. By the summer of 2008, the transfer was complete and the parts were lying outside the museum. The aircraft had continued to suffer additional corrosion during its years in Texas and was found to be in worse condition than expected, with the restoration task being beyond the resources of the museum in a realistic time scale. Some major components such as the wing spar would need to be completely replaced.

The NMUSAF&#x27;s plans for the restoration and display of the XC-99 are displayed in a case with a 1:72 scale model made by Lt Col Howard T. Meek, USAF (Ret).

In an effort to preserve the aircraft for future restoration, the XC-99 was later moved incrementally to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309 AMARG) storage facility at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base, in Tucson, Arizona, where it will remain, in an area containing other aircraft belonging to the NMUSAF until the museum is able to restore it. In 2014, Lieutenant General John L. Hudson, USAF (Ret), director of the NMUSAF said that there would be insufficient resources for restoration for the foreseeable future.

===Current location of the aircraft===
*XC-99, AF Ser. No. &quot;43-52436&quot; is now part of the National Museum of the United States Air Force collection at Wright-Patterson AFB. The aircraft was disassembled at Kelly AFB, Texas and its sections transported to NMUSAF for anti-corrosion preservation and reassembly there. It was subsequently transported in the summer of 2012 to Davis-Monthan AFB and is stored in Area 20 of the 309 AMARG complex, the so-called &quot;Boneyard&quot;, pending financial resources sufficient to restore the aircraft and return it to NMUSAF for display.

<doc id="466742" wikidata="Q1137269" url="?curid=466742" title="County-class destroyer">
<text>The County class was a class of British guided missile destroyers, the first such warships built by the Royal Navy. Designed specifically around the Seaslug anti-aircraft missile system, the primary role of these ships was area air defence around the aircraft carrier task force in the nuclear-war environment.

Eight ships were built and entered service. Two served in the British naval task force in the Falklands War in 1982. After leaving British service, four ships were sold to the Chilean Navy and one to the Pakistan Navy.

==Development==
A class of ten ships was envisaged in 1958 for about £6–7.5 million each, equivalent to a costed Programme for four large, Seaslug-armed, 15,000-ton cruisers, estimated at £14 million each, based on an upgraded &quot;Minotaur&quot;-class cruiser (1951), approved for full design in early 1955. The final four County-class ships, with hull numbers 07 to 10, were delayed in 1960 while an anti-submarine escort carrier was considered. Hulls 07 and 08 were approved in 1963 as a temporary stopgap, and the ninth and tenth hulls were cancelled.

The class was designed as a hybrid cruiser-destroyer with dimensions similar to the broad-beam 1951 &quot;Dido&quot; class. Much larger than predecessors such as the 2,800 ton . the new County class would be destroyer-leaders for aircraft carrier task forces and when operating &quot;East of Suez&quot; also play a traditional cruiser flagship role with shore bombardment, and attacking enemy shipping. In 1955 the new First Sea Lord Louis Mountbatten specified the development of 4,800 ton Fast fleet escort design (DNC 7/959) with a Seaslug missile replacing a stern twin 3-inch anti-aircraft mounting. This replacing a 15,000 ton cruiser design which would have combined Seaslug with the Type 984 3D radar and a conventional &quot;Tiger&quot;-class gun armament.

During 1956–1958 a full &quot;alternative&quot; gun armament was an option for the new Fast Escort for the fleet based on a modern combined gas turbine and steam turbine (COSAG) propulsion unit and armed with two twin 4.5-inch guns, two twin 40 mm Bofors and a single twin 3-inch gun. A detailed March 1957 study following the Suez Crisis and the 1957 Defence White Paper decided to increase the size of the new missile destroyers to that of light cruisers and include some cruiser features The study opted for a long hull with a fit of 18 Seaslug and four nuclear warhead fitted Seaslug for extended range anti-aircraft, anti-missile and anti-ship. Twin 40 mm Bofors were kept due to doubt over the future and effectiveness of the &quot;Green Light&quot; missile then under development. The Limbo mortar was the only anti-submarine weapon.

A revised design in March 1958 added Seaslug and Seacat missiles and a telescoping aircraft hangar. Mountbatten staged an impressive demonstration shoot for flag officers and politicians: the Seaslug test ship HMS &quot;Girdle Ness&quot; launched ten Seaslugs, including a salvo of two Seaslugs together. The success included hits in the lethal zone of two piston-engine Fairey Firefly radio-controlled drones at flying at a speed of 315-375 mph. This enabled the Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys to gain the approval of the Cabinet Defence Committee for Seaslug production to be approved in 1958.

While the missile worked against level flying targets, the beam guidance system was dubious at range and in rough water and eight fixed stabilisers were added to the design of the County-class. Advocacy for the guided missiles fit was led by Mountbatten and the Cabinet agreed with using the system, despite staff reports over missile unreliability and inaccuracy. This was confirmed by the dismal performance in the following Seaslug target launches at Woomera range, South Australia in 1959 Many Royal Australian Navy officers felt Seaslug was unsuitable for the RAN.

Final revisions to the design in 1958 were to adopt a high flush deck from B turret, increasing internal space, the cancellation of the nuclear-tipped Seaslug, and provision for folding fins for the Seaslug; this allowed storage of 20 extra missile bodies which could be rapidly assembled. Against staff advice, a tight fitting, fixed side-hangar for the anti-submarine Westland Wessex helicopter was added on the insistence of the First Sea Lord. While a flawed layout, it proved usable when tested in the Falklands War in 1982.

Lord Mountbatten classified the County-class as guided missile destroyers to gain Treasury and political support with cruisers discredited in the media as colonial relics, obsolete gunships like battleships. The Royal Navy staff and officers regarded the County class as cruisers and to signify they were major surface units they were given names previously carried by cruisers including the preceding County-class heavy cruisers and First World War armoured cruisers. They were however less than real cruisers, unarmoured and fitted to destroyer standards, except for staff accommodation and a dated, short ranged, semi automatic, 4.5 destroyer armament given additional spotting radar. They did provide space and weight for light Bofors and Oerlikons to be fitted if required as happened post Falklands War. The apparently impressive performance of Seaslug against jet Gloster Meteor UC15 drones, giving the Royal Navy a good number of impressive County-class &#x27;destroyers&#x27; and a greater number of ship commands and posts for ambitious officers.

While short on the support and logistic spares stocks of a traditional cruiser, they were envisaged by the Director of Naval Construction as being &#x27;probably&#x27; used in the cruiser role with space for Flag staff offices, and admiral&#x27;s barge accommodation in the 1960s: the last decade when the UK oversaw significant colonial territory East of Suez. Its missile capability had been overtaken by aircraft development by 1962–63, when HMS &quot;Devonshire&quot; and &quot;Hampshire&quot; entered service, but in the early and mid-1960s the modern lines of these guided-missile destroyers, with their traditional RN cruiser style and their impressive-looking missiles, enabled the overstretched Royal Navy to project sufficient power to close down the threat of a militant, left-leaning Indonesia to Malaysia and Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation.

==Design==
The County class was designed around the GWS1 Seaslug beam riding anti-aircraft missile system. Seaslug was a first-generation surface-to-air missile intended to hit high-flying nuclear-armed bombers and surveillance aircraft like the Tupolev Tu-16 &quot;Badger&quot; and Tupolev Tu-95 &quot;Bear&quot;, which could direct strikes against the British fleet from missile destroyers and cruise missile-armed submarines. The Tu 95 and the improved Tupolev Tu-142 were demanding targets for a missile like Seaslug; the long-range Soviet turboprop aircraft flew at an altitude of , at and were barely within the engagement capability of Seaslug. In 1956 during the first integrated trials of Sea Slug on HMS &quot;Girdle Ness&quot; cancellation of Seaslug was considered. The RAF found Seaslug could not cover low and high level targets and was only marginally capable on subsonic targets at 3–10 miles and height of 1–7 miles, and not effective against modern V Bomber, English Electric Canberra and Soviet Il-28 type aircraft which were likely to be used in a 1956 Suez confrontation. The missile was obsolete in many Admirals and MPs views compared the USN Terrier missilem the RAF Bristol Bloodhound and the British Army&#x27;s Thunderbird semi-active homing missiles in service by 1958. CNS, Mountbatten and Vice Admiral Reid, saw it as &#x27;deplorable&#x27; that Sea Slug was so far behind due to the lack of engineers and higher priority for Korea but it was essential to Royal Navy and UK credibility and independence to continue with Sea Slug. A new British missile or adoption of the Terrier Mk11 or Thunderbird would take too long. The improved Mark 2 version of Seaslug had 10,000 ft (3000 m) greater altitude and speed.

The Seaslug system was a large weapon. Each missile was long and weighed two tons; its handling arrangements and electronics systems were also large; so even fitting a single system aboard a ship the size of the Counties was a challenge. The missiles were stowed horizontally in a long unarmoured magazine which was sited above the waterline and took up a great deal of internal space. The risk of fire near the magazine was checked by an automatic sprinkler system. In order to increase the number of missiles that could be carried, on the last four ships, some of the missiles were stored partly disassembled in the forward end of the magazine. Their wings and fins would be reattached before being moved into the aft sections of the handling spaces and eventually loaded onto the large twin launcher for firing.

The limitations of the beam riding guidance method and lack of a homing head, meant the Mk 1 and 2 Seaslug were intended to have nuclear variants - the much larger blast compensating for lack of accuracy. However nuclear warhead for Mk 1 Seaslug (for the first group of ships) was dropped as it needed extra crew, space and security which were not available on the smaller hull; development of the nuclear warhead for Seaslug on the second group of ships was cancelled in June 1962, to reduce the naval budget, and the RNs requirement below 334 tactical nuclear warheads.

The County-class and the Seaslug missile were interim solutions and the new Sea Dart anti-aircraft missile would have speed and accuracy to ensure a hit without requiring a nuclear warhead. Mountbatten doubted the usefulness of tactical nuclear weapons by 1962, due to escalation theories, scientific advice and greater evidence of fallout consequences, leading to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. There were also staff and space difficulties with carrying nuclear warheads on confined destroyers. As early as 1952, Air Chief Marshal John Slessor (Chief of the Air Staff) the most influential defence Advisor to Winston Churchill considered the Navy irrelevant in a nuclear war, he first defined, the role of RN was &quot;uncertain&quot; as a pretext to maintain a large fleet and required only for political reasons. The collapse of the 1956 Suez operation and the huge impact of the British hydrogen bomb tests in 1954-57 led to the 1957 review of Britain&#x27;s defences, reliance on nuclear deterrence by strategic aircraft, missiles and missile submarines and doubt that a nuclear war would last long enough to require trans-Atlantic convoys. Corresponding doubt whether major conventional war was still possible on the basis of the last 1954-5 HC speeches of Churchill and Eisenhower, justified large cutbacks of British and American large ship, destroyer and carrier programmes and the future role and relevance of the Royal Navy was &quot;unclear&quot; moving the RN to more limited East of Suez task forces with gun and Seaslug- and Seacat-armed destroyers escorting medium British aircraft carriers with only a limited nuclear strike capacity against ships and cities equipped with Blackburn Buccaneer S.1 (and then the improved S.2) strike aircraft mainly aimed to deter regional powers such as Indonesia. Early versions of the equivalent US missile system RIM-2 Terrier, like Seaslug, relied on beam riding and needed a nuclear warhead variant to compensate for inaccuracy at low level and range. However, by 1962, the US was concentrating on the medium range radar guided RIM-24 Tartar and long range RIM-8 Talos, which had success against long range North Vietnamese aircraft from 1968. The Royal Air Force&#x27;s semi-active land-based Bristol Bloodhound was unrelated to Seaslug development, but drew top scientists away from RN work.

The County-class design attempted to give maximum protection from nuclear fallout. The operation rooms, where the ship was fought from, was located deep in the ship five decks below the bridge with a lift connecting it to the latter, which maintained some duplicated command systems. The operations room had the main radar, sonar and electronic warfare screens, and communication data and computer links. The electronics required for the Seaslug were the large Type 901 fire-control radar and the Type 965 air-search radar. These required a great deal of weight to be carried high up on the ship which affected the ship layout. Although superior the Type 984 radar was rejected as it was even heavier and would excluded fitting a twin turret 4.5-inch armament forward which was needed for gunfire support or action against surface vessels. It was hoped that RN carriers with Type 984 would provide primary air targeting for the destroyers through a datalink. According to a RN naval architect, &quot;Sea Slug did not live up to expectations&quot; and was obsolete by 1957. The compromises required by the heavy and dated Seaslug system detracted from the success and popularity of an otherwise advanced ship design. Its ineffectiveness and vulnerable magazine and missile fuel reduced confidence in the class, which had potential as command ships, having good seaworthiness, speed and in the group two ships a spacious operations room with ADAWS.

In 1960, because US-designed missiles were seen at the time to be superior to the Seaslug, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) proposed a variation of the County-class armed with the US Tartar missile and two additional modifications: hangar space for three Westland Wessex helicopters and a steam propulsion system, rather than the combined steam and gas system used in the County class. However, the RAN instead decided to proceed with the (a modified version of the US ). Two different reasons have been put forward for the Australian decision: according to an Australian history, British authorities would not allow a steam-propelled variant of the county, whereas, according to a British account, the re-design required to accommodate the Tartar missile would have taken longer than the RAN was prepared to accept.

The US Terrier missile had some support amongst the RN staff but consideration was not given to acquiring it for the second batch of four ships, as the County class were &quot;shop windows&quot; for advanced UK technology, and it was vital for the British missile and aerospace industry to continue the Sea Slug project, to allow the development of the much improved Sea Dart missile. Following problems with the original version, a reworked Action Data Automation Weapon System (ADAWS) was successfully trialled on HMS &quot;Norfolk&quot; in 1970. In the mid-1960s the County-class destroyers were assets; their impressive appearance and data links, feeding off the carriers&#x27; Type 984 radar, projected effective capability during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. The Mark 1 Seaslug was operationally reliable and proved useful as a missile target for the new Sea Dart missiles in the late 1970s and early 1980s; the supersonic Mark 2 version proved less effective for this. There are questions as to whether it was ever fully operational and there were problems with missiles breaking up when the boosters separated. Inaccuracy, primitive beam-riding guidance and lack of infrared homing or a proximity fuze in the Mk 1 made it of limited value. Short-range air defence was provided by the GWS-22 Seacat anti-aircraft missile system, which made the Counties the first Royal Navy warships to be armed with two different types of guided missile.

===Batch 2 improvements===

The second four Counties had improved air warning and target indicator radar (&quot;double bedstead&quot; 965M and a revised 992 for closer range tracking rather than only surface warning). The revised Seaslug Mk2 was supposedly effective against supersonic and surface targets at up to 30 km. ADAWS command and control system could process and prioritise air targets detected by the 965 and 992 radar and other so fitted RN warships. This was important as the Type 984 3D processing system on the carriers &quot;Victorious&quot;, &quot;Hermes&quot; and &quot;Eagle&quot; were removed from 1967 to 1972, affecting the first four County class ships which depended on datalinks to the carrier systems for primary radar and targeting processing of Seaslug.

As constructed, the County-class ships were armed with a pair of twin QF 4.5-inch gun mountings. These had magazines for 225 shells for each gun, two-thirds of the magazine capacity for the same guns in the single-turreted &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates. The second batch of four ships (&quot;Antrim&quot;, &quot;Fife&quot;, &quot;Glamorgan&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot;) were refitted in the mid-1970s – their &#x27;B&#x27; turrets were removed and replaced by four single MM38 Exocet surface-to-surface anti-ship-missile launcher boxes in order to increase the fleets anti-ship capability following retirement of its aircraft carriers. This made the County-class ships the only Royal Navy ships to be fitted with three separate types of guided missile: Seaslug, Seacat and Exocet.

===Possible development===
It was suggested by Vosper Thornycroft that the Counties could have been developed for the anti-submarine role by replacing the Seaslug system with a larger hangar and flight deck and the possibility of removing Seaslug and rebuilding the missile tunnel as storage for extra Westland Lynx helicopters. Certainly, these arrangements as originally installed to operate a single Westland Wessex anti-submarine helicopter were problematic, with a hangar so cramped it took an hour to get the aircraft either in or out again, during which the port Seacat launcher was unusable. However it was determined that beam-restrictions would still limit the Counties&#x27; helicopter operation in RN service to the obsolescent Wessex, as they were too narrow to handle the far more capable British-built Sea King HAS. The Chilean navy, however, did convert two of the four ships they purchased along these lines.

==Ships of the class==
Eight vessels were built in two batches between 1959 and 1970, the later four vessels carrying the improved Seaslug GWS2 and updated electronics requiring rearranged mastheads. The major identifying feature was the Batch 2 vessels&#x27; prominent &quot;double-bedstead&quot; AKE-2 antennas of the Type 965 air-search radar, and their taller foremast carrying the Type 992Q low-angle search radar.

===Ships&#x27; names===

Four of the &quot;Counties&quot; had names which had been used by the famous interwar s: &quot;London&quot;, &quot;Norfolk&quot;, &quot;Devonshire&quot; and &quot;Kent&quot;. (The last of that class, , had survived until 1959 as a trials ship). &quot;Devonshire&quot;, &quot;Hampshire&quot; and &quot;Antrim&quot; had been the names of armoured cruisers of the First World War.

Four of the new ships were named after counties containing a Royal Navy Dockyard: Devonshire (Devonport Dockyard), Hampshire (Portsmouth Dockyard), &quot;Kent&quot; (Chatham Dockyard), and Fife (Rosyth dockyard). Glamorgan and Antrim are the counties in Wales and Northern Ireland which contain the port cities and regional capitals of Cardiff and Belfast (by analogy to &quot;London&quot;, England). Norfolk is the county of Nelson&#x27;s birth, and the important 19th-century ports of Great Yarmouth and King&#x27;s Lynn.

Three of the ships&#x27; names have been subsequently re-used: was a Type 22 frigate. HMS &quot;Kent&quot; and HMS &quot;Norfolk&quot; were used for RN Type 23 frigates though in their case after British dukedoms.

==Service==
===1982 Falklands War===

&quot;Antrim&quot; and &quot;Glamorgan&quot; both served in the Falklands War; &quot;Antrim&quot; was the flagship of Operation Paraquet, the recovery of South Georgia in April 1982. Her helicopter, a Westland Wessex HAS Mk 3 (nicknamed &quot;Humphrey&quot;) was responsible for the rescue of 16 Special Air Service operators from Fortuna Glacier and the subsequent detection and disabling of the Argentinian submarine &quot;Santa Fe&quot;. In San Carlos Water, &quot;Antrim&quot; was hit by a 1,000 lb (450 kg) bomb which failed to explode. &quot;Glamorgan&quot;, after many days on the &quot;gun line&quot; bombarding Port Stanley airfield, was hit by an Exocet launched from land at the end of the conflict. It destroyed her aircraft hangar and the port Seacat mounting. Her Navigating Officer&#x27;s prompt reaction to visual detection of the Exocet narrowly averted a hit on the fatally vulnerable Seaslug magazine, by turning the ship so as to give as small a target as possible (the stern) to the incoming weapon. The ship suffered fourteen deaths, injuries, and was lucky to survive with extensive damage and flooding. Had the missile hit a few inches lower, the above waterline magazine would have blown in an explosive fireball and many more of the crew might have been lost.

===Disposal===
All eight of the class had short Royal Navy careers, serving on average less than 16 years. Only &quot;London&quot; of the first batch would serve further (transferred to Pakistan) while the other three Batch 1 ships were decommissioned by 1980 with &quot;Hampshire&quot; being immediately scrapped in 1977 after cannibalization for spares, and &quot;Devonshire&quot; sunk in weapons testing in 1984. &quot;Kent&quot; would serve as a floating (though immobile) accommodation and training ship in Portsmouth harbour until 1996. The four ships of Batch 2 however would be operated for 16 to 23 more years after sale to the Chilean Navy, in which they all received extensive upgrades and modernisation.

==Construction programme==
The ships were built at the major UK yards, with some of the machinery coming from Associated Electrical Industries of Manchester, Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company of Wallsend-on-Tyne, John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company of Southampton, Yarrows of Glasgow, and the Wallsend Slipway and Engineering Company, Wallsend-on-Tyne.

==Costs==

===Running costs===
===Cost of major refits===
In 1974, the costs of the major refits for County-class ships was given as £5½ million – £8 million.

===Demographics===
According to Japanese census data, the population of Sakai increased rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s, and has been relatively stable since.

==History==
===Origins===
The area that would later become known as Sakai has been inhabited since approximately 8,000 BC. Sakai is known for its keyhole-shaped burial mounds, or kofun, which date from the 5th century. The largest of these, Daisen Kofun, is believed to be the grave of the Emperor Nintoku and is the largest grave in the world by area. During the Kofun period between 300 and 500 AD, the Mozu Tumulus Cluster was built from over one hundred burial mounds. The name &quot;Sakai&quot; appears in Fujiwara Sadoyori&#x27;s poetry by 1045. Most of the current city is located within ancient Izumi Province; however, the wards of Mihara, Higashi and a portion of Kita are located within ancient Kawachi Province.

Tradition holds that 10,000 homes burned to the ground in 1399.
===Feudal period===
Medieval Sakai was an autonomous city run by merchant oligarchs. During the Muromachi and Sengoku periods from about 1450 to 1600, Sakai developed into one of richest cities in Japan as a port for foreign trade. It was a leading producer of textiles and ironwork. In those days, it was said that the richest cities were &quot;Umi no Sakai, Riku no Imai&quot; (tr. &quot;along the sea, Sakai; inlands, Imai&quot;; the latter is now a part of Kashihara, Nara). The famous Zen Buddhist priest Ikkyū chose to live in Sakai because of its free atmosphere. The first reliable account of the city is dated to the 1480s and contains publicly issued legal notices, which suggests that the city had a governing council at that point. By the 1530s, the population was around 40,000 residents, almost all of which earned a living through commercial enterprises and some of whom were the wealthiest people in Japan. At this time, Sakai was administered by an oligarchy of powerful merchants. The government had ten divisions &quot;machi&quot; that were subordinate to the representative council of wealthy townsmen known as the &quot;egōshū&quot;.

Sen no Rikyū, known as the greatest master of the tea ceremony, was originally a merchant of Sakai. Because of the close relationship between the tea ceremony and Zen Buddhism and because of the prosperity of its citizens, Sakai was one of the main centers of the tea ceremony in Japan.

In the Sengoku period, Christian missionaries, including Francis Xavier in 1550, visited Sakai and documented its prosperity. Gaspar Vilela described the town as the safest place in the area when he visited in 1561.
He also mentioned that the city was &quot;governed by consuls like Venice in Italy&quot;.

After the coming of Europeans, Sakai became a manufacturing base of matchlock firearms and a &quot;daimyō&quot;, Oda Nobunaga, was one of their important customers. During his ambitious attempt to unify Japan, Nobunaga attempted to take the autonomy privilege from Sakai. Sakai&#x27;s citizens denied his order and pitched a desperate battle against his army. Most citizens fled and Sakai was burned and seized by Nobunaga.

After the assassination of Nobunaga in 1582, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, seized power and abolished the autonomous system of Sakai, forcing many merchants to move to his stronghold in Osaka.

===Edo period===
In 1615, Sakai was razed to the ground in the summer campaign of the Siege of Osaka between the Toyotomi clan and Tokugawa Ieyasu.

Sakai was restored as an important trade center during the Edo period but was involved only in inland trade due to the &quot;sakoku&quot; policy of the Tokugawa shogunate, which isolated Japan from the outside world. It was also known for its &quot;sake&quot; brewing and its cutlery industries. After the isolation policy was abandoned during the Bakumatsu period, Sakai was the location of the Sakai Incident, involving a clash between French sailors and Japanese gendarmes resulting in multiple casualties. When the Western powers demanded the opening of Osaka a port for foreign trade, both Sakai and Hyōgo were named as candidates; however, Sakai&#x27;s proximity and ease of access to Kyoto and the presence of many imperial tombs led to the selection of Hyōgo.

===Modern Sakai===
Following the Meiji restoration, Sakai was transformed into an industrial center as part of the Hanshin Industrial Region, with industries centering on textiles and brick making. From 1876 to 1881, Sakai was part of Nara Prefecture. The city of Sakai was proclaimed on April 1, 1889, with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was one of the first 31 cities to be created in Japan. The 1934 Muroto typhoon killed over 300 people in Sakai. Another major disaster was in 1945, when the city was heavily bombed on six occasions during World War II with over 1800 civilian deaths.
Following the February 2005 annexation of the town of Mihara (from Minamikawachi District), Sakai became a designated city in April 2006 giving it a greater measure of self-determination in governmental affairs.

==Government==
Sakai has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 52 members. Sakai contributes eight members to the Osaka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the Osaka 15th district, Osaka 16th district and Osaka 17th districts of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

===Local administration===
Sakai has seven wards (&quot;ku&quot;):

==Economy==
Sakai was traditionally dependent on heavy industry and its port. However, after a period of high economic growth after World War II, along with the development and expansion of the Osaka metropolitan area, Sakai also has increasingly become a satellite city (commuter town) for Osaka metropolis, as represented by the development of Senboku New Town. Shimano, a major manufacturer of cycling and fishing products, is based in Sakai.

<text>Amygdules or amygdales () form when the vesicles (pores from gas bubbles in lava) of a volcanic rock or other extrusive igneous rock are infilled with a secondary mineral, such as calcite, quartz, chlorite, or one of the zeolites. Amygdules usually form after the rock has been emplaced, and are often associated with low-temperature alteration. Amygdules may often be concentrically zoned. Rocks containing amygdules can be described as &quot;amygdaloidal&quot;.

The word is derived from the Latin word &quot;amygdala&quot;, meaning &quot;almond tree&quot;, and the Greek word αμυγδαλή, meaning &quot;almond&quot;reflecting the typical shape of an infilled vesicle. &quot;Amygdule&quot; is more common in American usage, while &quot;amygdale&quot; is more common in British usage.

<text>Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a species of very small-cell bacteria that lack a cell wall, in the class Mollicutes. &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; is a human pathogen that causes the disease Mycoplasma pneumonia, a form of atypical bacterial pneumonia related to cold agglutinin disease.

It is one of the smallest self-replicating organisms and its discovery traces back to 1898 when Nocard and Roux isolated a microorganism linked to cattle pneumonia. This microbe shared characteristics with pleuropneumonia-like organisms (PPLOs), which were soon linked to pneumonias and arthritis in several animals. A significant development occurred in 1944 when Monroe Eaton cultivated an agent thought responsible for human pneumonia in embryonated chicken eggs, referred to as the &quot;Eaton agent.&quot; This agent was classified as a bacteria due to its cultivation method and because antibiotics were effective in treating the infection, questioning its viral nature. In 1961, a researcher named Robert Chanock, collaborating with Leonard Hayflick, revisited the Eaton agent and posited it could be a mycoplasma, a hypothesis confirmed by Hayflick’s isolation of a unique mycoplasma, later named &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;. Hayflick’s discovery proved &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; was responsible for causing human pneumonia.

Taxonomically, &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; is part of the Mollicutes class, characterized by their lack of a peptidoglycan cell wall, making them inherently resistant to antibiotics targeting cell wall synthesis, such as beta-lactams. With a reduced genome and metabolic simplicity, mycoplasmas are obligate parasites with limited metabolic pathways, relying heavily on host resources. This bacterium uses a specialized attachment organelle to adhere to respiratory tract cells, facilitating motility and cell invasion. The persistence of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections even after treatment is associated with its ability to mimic host cell surface composition.

Pathogenic mechanisms of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; involve host cell adhesion and cytotoxic effects, including cilia loss and hydrogen peroxide release, which lead to respiratory symptoms and complications such as bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Additionally, the bacterium produces a unique CARDS toxin, contributing to inflammation and respiratory distress. Treatment of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections typically involves macrolides or tetracyclines, as these antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis, though resistance has been increasing, particularly in Asia. This resistance predominantly arises from mutations in the 23S rRNA gene, which interfere with macrolide binding, complicating management and necessitating alternative treatment strategies.

==Discovery and history==
In 1898, Nocard and Roux isolated an agent assumed to be the cause of cattle pneumonia and named it &quot;microbe de la peripneumonie&quot; Microorganisms from other sources, having properties similar to the pleuropneumonia organism (PPO) of cattle, soon came to be known as pleuropneumonia-like organisms (PPLO), but their true nature remained unknown. Many PPLO were later proven to be the cause of pneumonias and arthritis in several lower animals.

In 1944, Monroe Eaton used embryonated chicken eggs to cultivate an agent thought to be the cause of human primary atypical pneumonia (PAP), commonly known as &quot;walking pneumonia.&quot; This unknown organism became known as the &quot;Eaton agent&quot;. At that time, Eaton&#x27;s use of embryonated eggs, then used for cultivating viruses, supported the idea that the Eaton agent was a virus. Yet it was known that PAP was amenable to treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, making a viral etiology suspect.

Robert Chanock, a researcher from the NIH who was studying the Eaton agent as a virus, visited the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia in 1961 to obtain a cell culture of a normal human cell strain developed by Leonard Hayflick. This cell strain was known to be exquisitely sensitive to isolate and grow human viruses. Chanock told Hayflick of his research on the Eaton agent, and his belief that its viral nature was questionable. Although Hayflick knew little about the current research on this agent, his doctoral dissertation had been done on animal diseases caused by PPLO. Hayflick knew that many lower animals suffered from pneumonias caused by PPLOs (later to be termed &quot;mycoplasmas&quot;). Hayflick reasoned that the Eaton agent might be a mycoplasma, and not a virus.
Chanock had never heard of mycoplasmas, and at Hayflick&#x27;s request sent him egg yolk containing the Eaton agent.

Using a novel agar and fluid medium formulation he had devised, Hayflick isolated a unique mycoplasma from the egg yolk. This was soon proven by Chanock and Hayflick to be the causative agent of PAP. When this discovery became known to Emmy Klieneberger-Nobel of the Lister Institute in London, the world&#x27;s leading authority on these organisms, she suggested that the organism be named &quot;Mycoplasma hayflickiae&quot;. Hayflick demurred in favor of &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;.

This smallest free-living microorganism was the first to be isolated and proven to be the cause of a human disease. For his discovery, Hayflick was presented with the Presidential Award by the International Organization of Mycoplasmology. The inverted microscope under which Hayflick discovered &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; is kept by the Smithsonian Institution.

==Taxonomy and classification==

The term mycoplasma ( meaning fungus, and , meaning formed) is derived from the fungal-like growth of some mycoplasma species. The mycoplasmas were classified as Mollicutes (“mollis”, meaning soft and “cutis”, meaning skin) in 1960 due to their small size and genome, lack of cell wall, low G+C content and unusual nutritional needs.

Mycoplasmas, which are among the smallest self-replicating organisms, are parasitic species that lack a cell wall and periplasmic space, have reduced genomes, and limited metabolic activity. &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; has also been designated as an arginine nonfermenting species. Mycoplasmas are further classified by the sequence composition of 16s rRNA. All mycoplasmas of the &quot;pneumoniae&quot; group possess similar 16s rRNA variations unique to the group, of which &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; has a 6.3% variation in the conserved regions, that suggest mycoplasmas formed by degenerative evolution from the gram-positive eubacterial group that includes bacilli, streptococci, and lactobacilli. &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; is a member of the family Mycoplasmataceae and order Mycoplasmatales.

==Cell biology==
&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; cells have an elongated shape that is approximately 0.1–0.2 μm (100–200 nm) in width and 1–2 μm (1000-2000 nm) in length. The extremely small cell size means they are incapable of being examined by light microscopy; a stereomicroscope is required for viewing the morphology of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; colonies, which are usually less than 100 μm in length. The inability to synthesize a peptidoglycan cell wall is due to the absence of genes encoding its formation and results in an increased importance in maintenance of osmotic stability to avoid desiccation. The lack of a cell wall also calls for increased support of the cell membrane(reinforced with sterols), which includes a rigid cytoskeleton composed of an intricate protein network and, potentially, an extracellular capsule to facilitate adherence to the host cell. &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; are the only bacterial cells that possess cholesterol in their cell membrane (obtained from the host) and possess more genes that encode for membrane lipoprotein variations than other mycoplasmas, which are thought to be associated with its parasitic lifestyle. &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; cells also possess an attachment organelle, which is used in the gliding motility of the organism by an unknown mechanism.

=== Genomics and metabolic reconstruction ===
Sequencing of the &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; genome in 1996 revealed it is 816,394 bp in size. The genome contains 687 genes that encode for proteins, of which about 56.6% code for essential metabolic enzymes; notably those involved in glycolysis and organic acid fermentation. &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; is consequently very susceptible to loss of enzymatic function by gene mutations, as the only buffering systems against functional loss by point mutations are for maintenance of the pentose phosphate pathway and nucleotide metabolism. Loss of function in other pathways is suggested to be compensated by host cell metabolism. In addition to the potential for loss of pathway function, the reduced genome of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; outright lacks a number of pathways, including the TCA cycle, respiratory electron transport chain, and biosynthesis pathways for amino acids, fatty acids, cholesterol and purines and pyrimidines. These limitations make &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; dependent upon import systems to acquire essential building blocks from their host or the environment that cannot be obtained through glycolytic pathways. Along with energy costly protein and RNA production, a large portion of energy metabolism is exerted to maintain proton gradients (up to 80%) due to the high surface area to volume ratio of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; cells. Only 12 – 29% of energy metabolism is directed at cell growth, which is unusually low for bacterial cells, and is thought to be an adaptation of its parasitic lifestyle.

Unlike other bacteria, &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; uses the codon UGA to code for tryptophan rather than using it as a stop codon.

=== Comparative metabolomics ===
&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; has a reduced metabolome in comparison to other bacterial species.  This means that the pathogen has fewer metabolic reactions in comparison to other bacterial species such as &quot;B.subtilis&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

Since &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; has a reduced genome, it has a smaller number of overall paths and metabolic enzymes, which contributes to its more linear metabolome. A linear metabolome causes &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; to be less adaptable to external factors.  Additionally, since &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; has a reduced genome, the majority of its metabolic enzymes are essential. This is in contrast to another model organism, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, in which only 15% of its metabolic enzymes are essential. In summary, the linear topology of &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&#x27;s&quot; metabolome leads to reduced efficiency in its metabolic reactions, but still maintains similar levels of metabolite concentrations, cellular energetics, adaptability, and global gene expression.

The table above depicts the mean path length for the metabolomes of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;L. lactis&quot;, and &quot;B. subtilis&quot;. This number describes, essentially, the mean number of reactions that occur in the metabolome. &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;, on average, has a high number of reactions per path within its metabolome in comparison to other model bacterial species.

One effect of &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;’s unique metabolome is its longer duplication time. It takes the pathogen significantly more time to duplicate on average compared to other model organism bacteria. This may be due to the fact that &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae’s&quot; metabolome is less efficient than that of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

The metabolome of &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; can also be informative in analyzing its pathogenesis. Extensive study of the metabolic network of this organism has led to the identification of biomarkers that can potentially reveal the presence of the extensive complications the bacteria can cause. Metabolomics is increasingly being used as a useful tool for the verification of biomarkers of infectious pathogens.

==Pathogenicity==
&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; parasitizes the respiratory tract epithelium of humans. Adherence to the respiratory epithelial cells is thought to occur via the attachment organelle, followed by evasion of host immune system by intracellular localization and adjustment of the cell membrane composition to mimic the host cell membrane.
&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; grows exclusively by parasitizing mammals. Reproduction, therefore, is dependent upon attachment to a host cell. According to Waites and Talkington, specialized reproduction occurs by “binary fission, temporally linked with duplication of its attachment organelle, which migrates to the opposite pole of the cell during replication and before nucleoid separation”. Mutations that affect the formation of the attachment organelle not only hinder motility and cell division, but also reduce the ability of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; cells to adhere to the host cell.

===Cytoadherence===
Adherence of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; to a host cell (usually a respiratory tract cell, but occasionally an erythrocyte or urogenital lining cell) is the initiating event for pneumonic disease and related symptoms. The specialized attachment organelle is a polar, electron dense and elongated cell extension that facilitates motility and adherence to host cells. It is composed of a central filament surrounded by an intracytoplasmic space, along with a number of adhesins and structural and accessory proteins localized at the tip of the organelle.
A variety of proteins are known to contribute to the formation and functionality of the attachment organelle, including the accessory proteins HMW1–HMW5, P30, P56, and P90 that confer structure and adhesin support, and P1, P30 and P116 which are involved directly in attachment. This network of proteins participates not only in the initiation of attachment organelle formation and adhesion but also in motility.
The P1 adhesin (trypsin-sensitive protein) is a 120 kDa protein highly clustered on the surface of the attachment organelle tip in virulent mycoplasmas. Both the presence of P1 and its concentration on the cell surface are required for the attachment of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; to the host cell. &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; cells treated with monoclonal antibodies specific to the immunogenic C-terminus of the P1 adhesin have been shown to be inhibited in their ability to attach to the host cell surface by approximately 75%, suggesting P1 is a major component in adherence. These antibodies also decreased the ability of the cell to glide quickly, which may contribute to decreased adherence to the host by hindering their capacity to locate a host cell. Furthermore, mutations in P1 or degradation by trypsin treatment yield avirulent &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; cells. Loss of proteins in the cytoskeleton involved in the localization of P1 in the tip structure, such as HMW1–HMW3, also cause avirulence due to the lack of adhesin clustering. Another protein considered to play an important role in adherence is P30, as &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; cells with mutations in this protein or that have had antibodies raised against P30 are incapable of adhering to host cells. P30 is not involved in the localization of P1 in the tip structure since P1 is trafficked to the attachment organelle in P30 mutants, but rather it may function as a receptor-binding accessory adhesin. P30 mutants also display distinct morphological features such as multiple lobes and a rounded shape as opposed to elongated, which suggests P30 may interact with the cytoskeleton during formation of the attachment organelle.
A number of eukaryotic cell surface components have been implicated in the adherence of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; cells to the respiratory tract epithelium. Among them are sialoglycoconjugates, sulfated glycolipids, glycoproteins, fibronectin, and neuraminic acid receptors. Lectins on the surface of the bacterial cells are capable of binding oligosaccharide chains on glycolipids and glycoproteins to facilitate attachment, in addition to the proteins TU and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 β, which bind to fibronectin.

===Intracellular localization===
&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; fuses with host cells and survive intracellularly. Thus it can evade host immune system detection, resist antibiotic treatment, and cross mucosal barriers. In addition to the close physical proximity of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; and host cells, the lack of cell wall and peculiar cell membrane components, like cholesterol, may facilitate fusion. Internal localization may produce chronic or latent infections as &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; is capable of persisting, synthesizing DNA, and replicating within the host cell even after treatment with antibiotics. The exact mechanism of intracellular localization is unknown, however the potential for cytoplasmic sequestration within the host explains the difficulty in completely eliminating &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections in afflicted individuals.

===Immune response===
In addition to evasion of host immune system by intracellular localization, &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; can change the composition of its cell membrane to mimic the host cell membrane and avoid detection by immune system cells. &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; cells possess a number of protein and glycolipid antigens that elicit immune responses, but variation of these surface antigens would allow the infection to persist long enough for &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; cells to fuse with host cells and escape detection. The similarity between the compositions of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; and human cell membranes can also result in autoimmune responses in several organs and tissues.

===Cytotoxicity and organismal effects===
The main cytotoxic effect of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; is local disruption of tissue and cell structure along the respiratory tract epithelium due to its attachment to host cells. Attachment of the bacteria to host cells can result in loss of cilia, a reduction in metabolism, biosynthesis, and import of macromolecules, and, eventually, infected cells may be shed from the epithelial lining. Local damage may also be a result of lactoferrin acquisition and subsequent hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion and peroxide formation.

Secondly, &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; produces a unique virulence factor known as Community Acquired Respiratory Distress Syndrome (CARDS) toxin. The CARDS toxin most likely aids in the colonization and pathogenic pathways of M. pneumoniae, leading to inflammation and airway dysfunction. 

The third virulence factor is the formation of hydrogen peroxide in &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections. When &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; is attached to erythrocytes, hydrogen peroxide diffuses from the bacteria to the host cell without it being detoxified by catalase or peroxidase, thus injuring the host cell by reducing glutathione, damaging lipid membranes and causing protein denaturation, i.e. oxidation of heme and hemolysis.

Most recently it was shown that hydrogen peroxide plays a minor if any role in haemolysis, but that hydrogen sulfide is the true culprit.

The cytotoxic effects of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections translate into common symptoms like coughing and lung irritation that may persist for months after infection has subsided. Local inflammation and hyperresponsiveness by infection induced cytokine production has been associated with chronic conditions such as bronchial asthma and has also been linked to progression of symptoms in individuals with cystic fibrosis and COPD.

== Antimicrobial activity ==

Infections can be treated with oral antibiotics from the macrolide family, which work by inhibiting the Mycoplasma protein biosynthesis. Historically, erythromycin is the oldest drug. As first choice, azithromycin or clarithromycin are used, as they have more convenient pharmacokinetics than erythromycin : they only need to be taken once or twice and not four times a day and they have fewer side effects. 
Alternatively, tetracyclines (eg, doxycycline), and respiratory fluoroquinolones (eg, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) can be used; they have an undesirable side effect profile in children. Beta-lactams such as penicillin are completely ineffective, because they target the cell wall synthesis.

===Resistance===
Resistance to macrolides has been reported as early as 1967. Increased antibiotic usage has been followed by an increase in resistance since 2000. Resistance in the 2020s has been highest in Asia, as high as 100%, while rates in the United States have varied from 3.5% to 13%. A single base mutation in the V region of 23S rRNA, like A2063/2064G is responsible for more than 90% of the macrolide-resistant infections.

Since routine culture and susceptibility testing is not performed, as &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; is difficult to grow, clinicians will select an antibiotic based on an estimate of local resistance, on treatment response and on other factors.

<text>William Eaton (23 February 1764 – 1 June 1811) was a United States Army officer and the diplomatic officer Consul General to Tunis (1797–1803). He played an important diplomatic and military role in the First Barbary War between the United States and Tripoli (1801–1805). He led the first foreign United States military victory at the Battle of Derne by capturing the Tripoli subject city of Derne in support of the restoration of the pasha (local monarch), Hamet Karamanli. He also gave testimony at the treason trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr.
Eaton served one term in the General Court of Massachusetts, which is the state legislature both during and after the colonial era. Eaton died on June 1, 1811, at the age of 47.

==Early life==
William Eaton was born in Woodstock, Connecticut. He was one of thirteen children of Nathaniel and Sarah (née Johnson) Eaton. His father was a middle class farmer, who worked as a school teacher in the winter, &quot;an employment for which he is represented as having been well qualified by more than ordinary means for a farmer&quot;. When he was ten years old, William&#x27;s family moved to Mansfield, Connecticut.

==Military career==
Eaton ran away at the age of sixteen to enlist in the army. He joined the Continental Army in 1780 and served until 1783, attaining the rank of sergeant at the age of 19. He earned money for college working as a school teacher in Windsor, Vermont. In 1790, he graduated from Dartmouth College. He and a classmate presented a poetic dialogue at the commencement. Between 1791 and 1792, he worked as a clerk in the lower house of the Vermont legislature

In 1792, Eaton accepted a captain&#x27;s commission in the Legion of the United States and began training at Legionville (Baden, Pennsylvania). He also married Eliza, the widow of General Timothy Danielson. In 1795, Eaton faced court-martial for charges resulting in a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; between himself and Lieutenant Colonel Henry Gaither. For the charges, which included those of profiteering and &quot;liberating from confinement&quot; a murder suspect, Eaton was sentenced to two months&#x27; suspended commission. Despite the conviction, Eaton held his commission until July 11, 1797, when he was appointed U.S. Consul at Tunis. He served at that post until war with Tripoli broke out in 1801. Other sources say he left the consul post in 1803.

===Tunis (1799–1803)===

Eaton&#x27;s main task in Tunis was to negotiate peace and trade agreements with the bey (governor). During the nineteenth century, European and American merchant ships were under threat by pirates from what was called &quot;The Barbary Coast&quot;. The Barbary Coast was made up of several Muslim states, under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, that bordered the Mediterranean Sea in Northern Africa. They acquired revenue from raiding merchant vessels of their cargo, ransoming their crews or selling them into slavery. The European nations opted to pay tribute to the Barbary states to prevent such raids. After the American Revolution, the United States was left without Britain&#x27;s protection in Mediterranean, thus the Washington and Adams administrations chose paying tribute to the Barbary states as a cost-effective alternative to military action.

By 1796, the United States was behind in payments to the dey of Algiers. In 1797, Joel Barlow, United States Consul to Algiers, negotiated with the dey and promised him a frigate, at the cost of nearly one million dollars. He then sent a French merchant, Joseph Stephen Famin, to negotiate with the bey of Tunis. An agreement was reached, but Congress would not ratify it. United States President John Adams appointed William Eaton as Consult to Tunis to negotiate more agreeable terms. It took two years to accomplish the task. In that time, as the demands of Algiers and Tripoli increased, Eaton had come to believe that it was better to use military force to secure trade in the region, than to continually pay tribute. He wrote an impassioned letter to the Secretary of State, James Madison, voicing the opinion that, &quot;The more you give the more the Turks will ask for.&quot;

Jack Kelly, of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, wrote in the a 2009 article, &quot;Kill The Pirates&quot;, that Thomas Jefferson favored an international military intervention to the payment of tribute. Kelly said that Jefferson was unable to convince Europe to take such a course. When he became president of the United States, in 1801, he refused to pay tribute to Tripoli. The Atlantic Monthly (1860), called the belief that the United States was the first to refuse tribute to the Barbary pirates a &quot;patriotic delusion&quot;. The article, flouting what it called &quot;the popular view&quot; of events said, &quot;The money question between the President and the pasha was simply one of amount&quot;. It went on to say that Jefferson was motivated in his actions toward Tripoli by pressure from powerful merchants. The pasha of Tripoli, Yusef Karamanli (sometimes referred to as Karamanli or Karamanli), responded to the lack of payment by declaring war on the United States.

Tunis was the closest neighbor to Tripoli and the deposed pasha of Tripoli, Hamet Karamanli, was exiled there. He was, in fact, the elder brother of the reigning pasha, Yusuf Karamanli. William Eaton devised a plan in which the United States would support the restoration of Hamet Karamanli as pasha thereby creating fear of the U.S. within the rest of the Muslim world. He borrowed $22,000 to support the plan, but at this point did not receive the backing of the U.S. government. While the demands for tribute from the bey of Tunis continued, Eaton refused to convey the demands to the United States. He requested that he be recalled, as he felt he could no longer negotiate with the bey. In addition, a U.S. fleet, under the command of Commodore Richard Morris, had recently captured a Tunisian vessel that was headed for Tripoli. Morris came ashore in Tunis to visit Eaton and was arrested for Eaton&#x27;s debt of $22,000. Eaton borrowed the money to pay the debt from the French Consul-General. At that point the bey ordered him to leave Tunis, which he did in the company of Morris. Hamet Karamanli, having failed at his attempt to regain Tripoli, fled to Egypt.

===War with Tripoli and the Battle of Derne===
Eaton returned to the Barbary region in 1804, this time on a military mission. It had taken months for word of Tripoli&#x27;s declaration of war on the United States to reach President Jefferson, but he had already sent naval forces to the Barbary Coast because William Eaton had informed him that the situation in Tripoli was &quot;nearing a breaking point.&quot; Among the vessels that were sent was the USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot; which, in October, 1803, under the command of Captain William Bainbridge, was sent to blockade Tripoli. The frigate ran aground off the coast of Tripoli and was captured along with its crew of 306 men. Bainbridge had failed to scuttle the ship before being captured, but Stephen Decatur, commander of the USS &quot;Intrepid&quot;, in a covert mission, destroyed the &quot;Philadelphia&quot; by burning it, to prevent Tripoli from using it.

In May 1804, Eaton was given the commission of a navy lieutenant and sent back to the Barbary regencies, under the supervision of Commodore James Barron, to find Hamet Karamanli and enlist his cooperation in the war. Eaton found Karamanli in Alexandria and signed an agreement with him, although it is unclear if he had the authority to do so. This contract, which was forwarded to Secretary of State Madison, specified that the United States would provide cash, ammunition and provisions for Ahmed Karamanli&#x27;s re-installation as pasha. It also designated William Eaton as &quot;General and Commander in Chief&quot; of the land forces that were to be used to carry out the operation. The agreement defined the relationship between Karamanli and Eaton as well as their mission, but was never ratified by the United States Senate.

The Americans included eight marines and two navy midshipmen. It was with that force that Eaton and Karamanli made the 600 mile trek from Alexandria to Derne, a coastal city within the realm of Tripoli. By the time the band had reached the Gulf of Bomba, they had eaten their last rations and the Arab factions were on the verge of mutiny. Eaton had written to Captain Isaac Hull of the USS &quot;Argus&quot; requesting that the ship meet them there with supplies, but when they arrived on April 15, there was no ship to be seen. The next day, however, the &quot;Argus&quot; appeared as Hull had seen the smoke from their fires. After resupplying, they continued their journey, and on April 27, 1805, Eaton&#x27;s forces attacked and took control of Derne. &quot;First Lieutenant Presley O&#x27;Bannon of the U.S. Marine Corps raised the American flag for the first time over a conquered foreign city.&quot; At the Battle of Derne, one marine was killed and two were wounded. Eaton was wounded in the left wrist.

Twice Yusef Karamanli&#x27;s forces tried and failed to take back the city. With the bey of Derne on the run and Hamet Karamanli reestablished in Derne, Eaton thought to march toward Tripoli. He requested reinforcements from Barron but instead received word that US Consul-General Tobias Lear was negotiating peace with Yusef Karamanli. Then he received word from Lear himself that he was to surrender Derne as peace had been reached on June 4. The terms of the treaty required the US to pay $60,000 for the release of the crew of the &quot;Philadelphia.&quot; Hamet Karamanli and his entourage of about 30 were allowed to leave, but his wife and family were held captive until 1807, as provided in the treaty.

===Aftermath===
Although Eaton returned to the United States to a hero&#x27;s welcome, he was disappointed and embittered by the treaty and outraged that ransom had to be paid for the freeing of the hostages. He had been denied victory in Tripoli and his agreement with Hamet Karamanli was left unkept. Furthermore, the government owed him money that he had fronted for the expedition. He complained loudly that the government was guilty of duplicity in regard to Hamet Karamanli. His complaints drew the attention of Jefferson&#x27;s enemies in the Federalist party.

In January 1806, Congress was presented with a petition from Hamet Karamanli for money and the release of his family from his brother&#x27;s custody. The issue became partisan with the Federalists supporting Karamanli&#x27;s and Eaton&#x27;s claims that the government had rescinded its agreement to re-establish Karamanli as Tripolitan pasha. Jefferson, and his supporters, on the other hand, denied that administration ever intended the arrangement, contending that Eaton had lacked the authority to broker the deal. Nevertheless, despite the Federalist opposition, the treaty with Tripoli was ratified by the Senate in April 1806, and the United States entered into an agreement with a Barbary state that, for the first time, did not include the payment of tribute.

Initially, Eaton&#x27;s victory in Derne was viewed by both parties as the motivating factor for Tripoli in the settlement of the war. However, his willingness to become involved in the partisan bickering cost Eaton official recognition for his accomplishment. It had been proposed that Congress present Eaton with a sword, but Federalists argued that he be given a gold medal. The debate was never resolved thus he did not receive &quot;a sword, a medal, a tract of public land or simply a resolution of thanks&quot;. He did however, receive from Massachusetts in present-day Maine.

===Trial of Aaron Burr===
Eaton was a principal witness in the 1807 treason trial of former United States Vice-President Aaron Burr. Burr was vice president during President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s first term (1801–1805). Avoiding murder charges resulting from the death of his political rival Alexander Hamilton in a duel (1804), Burr traveled throughout the west. During this time, he met with many military men who were disgruntled with the government, including Eaton and General James Wilkinson. According to Eaton&#x27;s later testimony, he and Burr met several times, and Eaton came to believe that Burr was planning to raise an army to invade Spanish territory in the southwest and to establish an independent state, with himself as sovereign. Eaton then met with Jefferson to suggest that Burr be given an overseas post, warning that if he was not sent out of the country he would stage an insurrection within eighteen months. The President responded that he felt secure enough in the unity of the American people not to feel threatened by such an insurrection. Eaton again warned of Burr&#x27;s plans, in the fall of 1806, when he forwarded to the State Department a letter that he had received from his stepson, Timothy Danielson Jr., sent to him by a friend in Ohio, Morris Belknap. The letter said that Burr had been purchasing boats in Ohio, and offering young men army posts. Finally, Wilkinson sent Jefferson a letter including what he claimed was a decryption of ciphered treasonous correspondence received from Burr.

In 1807, Burr was arrested for treason. Although Jefferson privately confided to Senator William Plumber of New Hampshire that he did not think there was enough evidence to convict Burr of treason, his public condemnation of Burr, along with Wilkinson&#x27;s letter and the deposition of William Eaton, insured an indictment. On January 26, 1807, Eaton gave a deposition regarding his conversations with Burr. The affidavit stated that, as he listened to Burr&#x27;s ambitions, Eaton came to believe that Burr was planning the overthrow of the United States government. He further stated that Burr offered him the rank of General in his army. Eaton continued to say,
&quot;He [Burr] said, if he could gain over the marine corps, and secure the naval commanders, Truxton, Preble, Decatur, and others, he would turn Congress neck and heels out of doors; assassinate the President; seize on the treasury and navy; and declare himself the protector of an energetic government.&quot;
Burr&#x27;s treason trial in Richmond, Virginia, began in August, 1807 with Eaton as the first prosecution witness. Eaton reiterated what he had said in his deposition. To discredit Eaton, the defense questioned Eaton about $10,000 he had received from the federal government since giving his deposition, implying that the administration had paid him for his testimony. Eaton countered that the $10,000 was, in fact, reimbursement for money he spent in the Barbary War (which one source contends was less than what he was owed). Historians are divided on the status of Eaton&#x27;s testimony. While one states that it was wildly exaggerated, another counters that &quot;Burr apologists&quot; are responsible for that point of view. Whatever the case, presiding judge John Marshall and the jury were unconvinced, and Burr was acquitted.

Eaton was subpoenaed again for another trial, in Ohio. This time the defense sought to discredit Eaton&#x27;s testimony by bringing up the court-martial brought against him while he was a captain. By this time the records of the court-martial had been destroyed in a fire. It scarcely mattered anyway, as the trial itself never took place.

==Final days==
After peace with Tripoli was made, William Eaton returned to Brimfield, Massachusetts, the place he had called home for most of his life. He was elected to the state legislature, but only served one term. Burr&#x27;s trial had proved to be a partisan issue, dividing the Federalists and the Jeffersonian Republicans. After the trial Eaton was verbal about the treatment that he had received from the Federalists, notably John Marshall, chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Having lost the Federalist vote in Brimfield because of his outspokenness, Eaton failed at his bid for re-election.

Eaton suffered from rheumatism and gout, and by all accounts he had taken to drinking heavily. He was also in debt from gambling. He died on June 1, 1811, in Brimfield. Eaton was predeceased by his wife Eliza (née Sikes) Danielson; daughters Eliza (married Goodwin), Charlotte (married Sprague) and Almira (married Hayden); sons William Sikes and Nathaniel Johnson; stepson Timothy Danielson; and a stepdaughter. Skies and Johnson were West Point graduates.

==Legacy==

William Eaton is the namesake of three U.S. towns: Eatonton, Georgia, Eaton, New York, and Eaton, Ohio. He was also the namesake of the Fletcher-class destroyer USS Eaton.

The Tripoli Monument, in memory of the first American military casualties overseas in the battle at Derne, was sculpted of Italian marble by artist Giovanni Micali in 1806, and transported to the United States by the frigate &quot;USS Constitution&quot; (&quot;Old Ironsides&quot;) and placed at the new national capital of Washington, D.C. at the Washington Navy Yard on the East Branch (now the Anacostia River) of the Potomac River in 1808. Considered the first war monument in the United States, it was unfortunately vandalized by the British during the War of 1812 in August 1814, when they attacked and occupied Washington, burning the public buildings and facilities. Later in 1831, it was relocated to the west front of the United States Capitol, overlooking the National Mall. In 1860, it was relocated to the campus of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, where although moved several more times over the decades, remains there today. In 2001, it underwent repairs and a physical restoration.

==In popular culture==
Consul General Eaton and his actions at Derne with other U.S. Navy personnel along with Greek mercenaries, were loosely portrayed in the 1950 historical feature film &quot;Tripoli&quot;, starring John Payne, Maureen O&#x27;Hara, and Howard da Silva.

<doc id="466756" wikidata="Q2697152" url="?curid=466756" title="Avianca Flight 203">
<text>Avianca Flight 203 was a Colombian domestic passenger flight from El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá to Alfonso Bonilla Aragón International Airport in Cali, Colombia. It was destroyed by a bomb over the municipality of Soacha on November 27, 1989. All 107 people on board as well as three people on the ground were killed. The bombing had been ordered by the Medellín drug cartel.

== Aircraft and crew ==

The aircraft was a Boeing 727-21 with registration number HK-1803, serial number 19035, and line number 272. The aircraft was built in 1966, and had its maiden flight on May 19 of the same year. The aircraft was delivered to Pan Am on May 28, and was registered as N326PA. Avianca acquired the aircraft in November 1975, when it was re-registered as HK-1803.

The captain was José Ignacio Ossa Aristizábal, the first officer was Fernando Pizarro Esguerra, and the flight engineer was Luis Jairo Castiblanco Vargas. There were three flight attendants on board.

== Flight ==
Flight 203 took off as scheduled at 7:13 a.m. Five minutes into the flight, at a speed of and an altitude of , an explosive charge detonated, causing fuel vapors in the empty central fuel tank to ignite. Eyewitnesses on the ground reported seeing fire erupt out of the right side of the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage. A second blast ripped the airliner apart; the nose section separated from the tail section, which went down in flames. The wreckage was scattered in a radius around the town of Soacha. All 107 people on board were killed, as well as three people on the ground who were hit by falling debris.

== Background ==
An investigation determined that plastic explosives were used to destroy the plane. Drug king Pablo Escobar, of the Medellín drug cartel, planned the bombing in the lead-up to the 1990 elections, hoping the bomb plot would kill presidential candidate César Gaviria. One account states that two unidentified men dressed in suits who worked for Escobar carried the bomb on board. The men sat in seats 18A and 18K, located above the main fuel tank. At the last moment, one of the men left the aircraft, while his partner stayed on board and was killed in the bombing. A young Colombian man named Alberto Prieto was duped into staying on the flight and activating the bomb once the aircraft had become airborne thus unknowingly killing himself; he had been told the device was just a recorder he had to turn on to record the conversation of a nearby couple of passengers; because of this, the man had been nicknamed &quot;El Suizo&quot;, or &quot;The Swiss&quot;, in reference to his role as a &quot;suicide&quot; bomber.
Gaviria was not on the aircraft, despite Escobar&#x27;s expectations, and went on to be elected president. Two Americans were among the dead, prompting the Bush administration to begin Intelligence Support Activity operations to find Escobar.

Nine days after the bombing of the plane, the DAS Building bombing, presumably also ordered by the Medellín Cartel, killed 63 people in Bogotá.

Dandeny Muñoz Mosquera, the chief assassin for the Medellín Cartel, was convicted in 1994 in United States District Court of having been involved in the bombing and various other crimes, and was sentenced to 10 consecutive life sentences.

Avianca has not retired the flight number. Avianca 203 is, as of 2024, a flight from Orlando to Medellín.

== Later events ==
On November 28, 2016, the Colombian newspaper &quot;El Espectador&quot; started publishing an investigative report, consisting of 8 chapters, on Flight 203. It argues that the explosion was caused by a malfunctioning fuel pump inside a tank which had been reported several times before. The report was heavily criticized by Avianca and family members of the victims.

== In popular culture == 
This event is dramatized in Season 1, Episode 6 of &quot;Narcos&quot; (2015).

<doc id="466758" wikidata="Q3544522" url="?curid=466758" title="USS Chenango (CVE-28)">
<text>The second USS &quot;Chenango&quot; (CVE-28) (originally designated as T3 Tanker oiler AO-31, after re-designation as an escort carrier, was first ACV-28) was launched on 1 April 1939 as &quot;Esso New Orleans&quot; by the Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, in Chester, Pennsylvania, sponsored by Mrs. Rathbone; acquired by the United States Navy on 31 May 1941; and commissioned on 20 June 1941 as AO-31.

==Service as oiler==
Assigned to the Naval Transportation Service, &quot;Chenango&quot; steamed in the Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Pacific as far as Honolulu on tanker duty. &quot;Chenango&quot; was present at Aruba, N.W.I. on 16 February 1942 when a German submarine shelled one of the island&#x27;s refineries. She was decommissioned at Brooklyn Navy Yard on 16 March for conversion to an escort carrier.

==Conversion and combat service as escort carrier==
Her conversion complete, she was recommissioned as ACV-28 on 19 September 1942. Carrying 77 P-40 Warhawks of the 33rd Fighter Group of the United States Army Air Forces, &quot;Chenango&quot; sailed on 23 October with the Torch assault force bound for North Africa, and on 10 November, flew off her aircraft to newly won Port Lyautey, French Morocco. She put into Casablanca on 13 November to refuel 21 destroyers before returning to Norfolk, Virginia, on 30 November, battling through a hurricane en route which caused extensive damage.

Quickly repaired, &quot;Chenango&quot; was underway for the Pacific by mid-December, possibly alongside as part of Task Force 13. Arriving at Nouméa on 18 January 1943, she joined the escort carrier group providing air cover for supply convoys supporting the invasion and occupation of the Solomon Islands. One of her air groups was sent to Henderson Field, Guadalcanal to give close support to U.S. Marine Corps forces ashore. One of &quot;Chenango&quot;″s duties during this period was to stand sentry off the fiercely contested island. As part of her Solomons operations, &quot;Chenango&quot;″s planes formed an air umbrella to escort to safety and after the cruisers were damaged in the Battle of Kolombangara on 13 July. Redesignated CVE-28 on 15 July, &quot;Chenango&quot; returned to Mare Island on 18 August for an overhaul, then acted as training carrier for new air groups until 19 October. She steamed from San Diego to join the Gilbert Islands invasion force at Espiritu Santo on 5 November. During the invasion of Tarawa from 20 November-8 December, her planes covered the advance of the attack force, bombed and strafed beaches ahead of the invading troops, and protected off-shore convoys. On 29 November 1943, at 21:57, her Avenger TBFs (Air Group 35) found and sank a Japanese submarine, probably &quot;I-21&quot;. She returned to San Diego for another period of training duty.

Steaming from San Diego on 13 January 1944, &quot;Chenango&quot; supported the invasion landings on Roi, Kwajalein, and Eniwetok in the Marshalls operation. After protecting the service group refueling fleet units engaged in the Palau strikes, &quot;Chenango&quot; arrived at Espiritu Santo on 7 April. She sortied for the landings at Aitape and Hollandia (now Jayapura) (16 April–12 May), then joined Task Group 53.7 (TG 53.7) for the invasion of the Marianas. Her planes crippled airfield installations, sank enemy shipping, and hammered harbor facilities on Pagan Island, as well as conducting valuable photographic reconnaissance of Guam. From 8 July, she joined in daily poundings of Guam, preparing for the island&#x27;s invasion. She returned to Manus on 13 August to replenish and conduct training.

From 10 to 29 September, &quot;Chenango&quot; joined in the neutralization of enemy airfields in the Halmaheras in support of the invasion of Morotai, stepping-stone to the Philippines. After preparations at Manus, &quot;Chenango&quot; cleared on 12 October to conduct softening up strikes on Leyte in preparation for the invasion landings on 20 October. &quot;Chenango&quot; and her sister ship were attacked by three Japanese planes on the afternoon of D-Day, and shot down all three, capturing one of the pilots. Sailing to Morotai to load new aircraft, &quot;Chenango&quot; was not in action waters during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, but returned on 28 October to provide replacement aircraft to her victorious sister escort carriers, who had held the Japanese fleet off from Leyte. The next day, she sailed for overhaul at Seattle, Washington until 9 February 1945.

After the overhaul period, she again sailed west, arriving at Tulagi in the Solomons on 4 March. &quot;Chenango&quot; conducted training, then sortied from Ulithi on 27 March for the invasion of Okinawa. She gave air cover in the feint landings on the southern tip of the island, then was assigned to neutralize the &quot;kamikaze&quot; bases in Sakashima Gunto. On 9 April, a crash-landing fighter started a raging fire among the strike-loaded aircraft on &quot;Chenango&quot;″s deck. Skillful work by her crew saved the ship from serious damage and she remained in action off Okinawa until 11 June. After escorting a tanker convoy to San Pedro Bay, &quot;Chenango&quot; sailed on 26 July to join the logistics force for the 3rd Fleet, then engaged in the final offensive against Japan.

==Postwar service and scrapping==
Following the cease-fire, &quot;Chenango&quot; supported the occupation forces and evacuated some 1,900 Allied prisoners of war and 1,500 civilians from slave labor camps. She cleared Tokyo Bay on 25 October, and after a brief overhaul at San Diego, returned to &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; duty, transporting veterans from Okinawa and Pearl Harbor to the West Coast. &quot;Chenango&quot; sailed from San Pedro, California on 5 February for Boston, and was placed out of commission in reserve there on 14 August 1946. She was reclassified CVHE-28 on 12 June 1955, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959, sold and removed from naval custody on 12 February 1960.

==Awards==
&quot;Chenango&quot; was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation and received 11 battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="466760" wikidata="Q1071580" url="?curid=466760" title="Wild man">
<text>The wild man, wild man of the woods, woodwose or wodewose is a mythical figure and motif that appears in the art and literature of medieval Europe, comparable to the satyr or faun type in classical mythology and to &quot;Silvanus&quot;, the Roman god of the woodlands.

The defining characteristic of the figure is its &quot;wildness&quot;; from the 12th century, it was consistently depicted as being covered with hair. Images of wild men appear in the carved and painted roof bosses where intersecting ogee vaults meet in Canterbury Cathedral, in positions where one is also likely to encounter the vegetal Green Man. The image of the wild man survived to appear as supporter for heraldic coats-of-arms, especially in Germany, well into the 16th century. Renaissance engravers in Germany and Italy were particularly fond of wild men, wild women, and wild families, with examples from Martin Schongauer (died 1491) and Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) among others.

==Terminology==
The normal Middle English term, also used to the present day, was woodwose or wodewose (also spelled &quot;woodehouse&quot;, &quot;wudwas&quot; etc., understood perhaps as variously singular or plural). &quot;Wodwos&quot; occurs in &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; (c. 1390). The Middle English word is first attested for the 1340s, in references to the wild man popular at the time in decorative art, as in a Latin description of an tapestry of the Great Wardrobe of Edward III, but as a surname it is found as early as 1251, of one &quot;Robert de Wudewuse&quot;. In reference to an actual legendary or mythological creature, the term is found during the 1380s, in Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible, translating (LXX δαιμόνια, Latin &quot;pilosi&quot; meaning &quot;hairy&quot;) in Isaiah 13:21 The occurrences in &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; date to soon after Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible, to c. 1390.

The Old English form of &quot;woodwose&quot; is unattested, but it would have been either or . The first element is usually explained as from &quot;wood, forest&quot;. The second element is less clear. It has been identified as a hypothetical noun &quot;*wāsa&quot; &quot;being&quot;, from the verb &quot;wesan&quot;, &quot;wosan&quot; &quot;to be, to be alive&quot;. It might alternatively mean a forlorn or abandoned person, cognate with German &quot;Waise&quot; and Dutch &quot;wees&quot; which both mean &quot;orphan&quot;.

Old High German had the terms , or , which appear in glosses of Latin works as translations for , , or , identifying the creatures as hairy woodland beings. Some of the local names suggest associations with characters from ancient mythology. Common in Lombardy and the Italian-speaking parts of the Alps are the terms &quot;salvan&quot; and &quot;salvang&quot;, which derive from the Latin &quot;Silvanus&quot;, the name of the Roman tutelary god of gardens and the countryside. Similarly, folklore in Tyrol and German-speaking Switzerland into the 20th century included a wild woman known as &quot;Fange&quot; or &quot;Fanke&quot;, which derives from the Latin &quot;fauna&quot;, the feminine form of &quot;faun&quot;. Medieval German sources give as names for the wild woman &quot;lamia&quot; and &quot;holzmoia&quot; (or some variation); the former clearly refers to the Greek wilderness demon Lamia while the latter derives ultimately from Maia, a Greco-Roman earth and fertility goddess who is identified elsewhere with Fauna and who exerted a wide influence on medieval wild-man lore.
Slavic has &quot;leshy&quot; &quot;forest man&quot;.

Various languages and traditions include names suggesting affinities with Orcus, a Roman and Italic god of death. For many years people in Tyrol called the wild man &quot;Orke&quot;, &quot;Lorke&quot;, or &quot;Noerglein&quot;, while in parts of Italy he was the or . The French ogre has the same derivation, as do modern literary orcs. Importantly, Orcus is associated with Maia in a dance celebrated late enough to be condemned in a 9th- or 10th-century Spanish penitential.

The term was usually replaced in literature of the Early Modern English period by classically derived equivalents, or &quot;wild man&quot;, but it survives in the form of the surname &quot;Wodehouse&quot; or &quot;Woodhouse&quot; (see Wodehouse family). &quot;Wild man&quot; and its cognates is the common term for the creature in most modern languages; it appears in German as , in French as and in Italian as &quot;forest man&quot;.

==Origins==
Figures similar to the European wild man occur worldwide from very early times. The earliest recorded example of the type is the character Enkidu of the ancient Mesopotamian &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;.

The description of Nebuchadnezzar II in the Book of Daniel (2nd century BC) may have greatly influenced the medieval European concepts. Daniel 4 depicts God humbling the Babylonian king for his boastfulness; stricken mad and ejected from human society, he grows hair on his body and lives like a beast. This image was popular in medieval depictions of Nebuchadnezzar. Late medieval legends of Saint John Chrysostom (died 407) describe the saint&#x27;s asceticism as making him so isolated and feral that hunters who capture him cannot tell if he is man or beast.

The medieval wild-man concept also drew on lore about similar beings from the Classical world such as the Roman faun and Silvanus, and perhaps even Heracles. Several folk traditions about the wild man correspond with ancient practices and beliefs. Notably, peasants in the Grisons tried to capture the wild man by getting him drunk and tying him up in hopes that he would give them his wisdom in exchange for freedom. This suggests an association with an ancient tradition – recorded as early as Xenophon (d. 354 BC) and appearing in the works of Ovid, Pausanias, and Claudius Aelianus – in which shepherds caught a forest being, here termed Silenus or Faunus, in the same manner and for the same purpose.

Besides mythological influences, medieval wild man lore also drew on the learned writings of ancient historians, though likely to a lesser degree. These ancient wild men are naked and sometimes covered with hair, though importantly the texts generally localize them in some faraway land, distinguishing them from the medieval wild man who was thought to exist just at the boundaries of civilization. The first historian to describe such beings, Herodotus (), places them in western Libya alongside the headless men with eyes in their chest and dog-faced creatures. After the appearance of the former Persian court physician Ctesias&#x27;s book &quot;Indika&quot; (concerning India), which recorded Persian beliefs about the Indian subcontinent, and the conquests of Alexander the Great, India became the primary home of fantastic creatures in the Western imagination, and wild men were frequently described as living there. Megasthenes, Seleucus I Nicator&#x27;s ambassador to Chandragupta Maurya, wrote of two kinds of men to be found in India whom he explicitly describes as wild: first, a creature brought to court whose toes faced backwards; second, a tribe of forest people who had no mouths and who sustained themselves with smells. Both Quintus Curtius Rufus and Arrian refer to Alexander himself meeting with a tribe of fish-eating savages while on his Indian campaign.

Distorted accounts of apes may have contributed to both the ancient and medieval conception of the wild man. In his &quot;Natural History&quot; Pliny the Elder describes a race of &quot;silvestres,&quot; wild creatures in India who had humanoid bodies but a coat of fur, fangs, and no capacity to speak – a description that fits gibbons indigenous to the area. The ancient Carthaginian explorer Hanno the Navigator (fl. 500 BC) reported an encounter with a tribe of savage men and hairy women in what may have been Sierra Leone; their interpreters called them &quot;Gorillae,&quot; a story which much later originated the name of the gorilla species and could indeed have related to a great ape. Similarly, the Greek historian Agatharchides describes what may have been chimpanzees as tribes of agile, promiscuous &quot;seed-eaters&quot; and &quot;wood-eaters&quot; living in Ethiopia.

One of the historical precedents which could have inspired the wild man representation could be the Grazers; a group of monks in Eastern Christianity which lived alone, without eating meat, and often completely naked. They were viewed as saints in Byzantine society, and the hagiographical accounts about their lives were spread in all of Christianity, possibly influencing later authors.

==Medieval representations==

Some of the earliest evidence for the wild-man tradition appears in the above-mentioned 9th- or 10th-century Spanish penitential. This book describes a dance in which participants donned the guise of the figures Orcus, Maia, and Pela, and ascribes a minor penance for those who participate with what was apparently a resurgence of an older pagan custom. The identity of Pela is unknown, but the earth goddess Maia appears as the wild woman (&quot;Holz-maia&quot; in the later German glossaries), and names related to Orcus were associated with the wild man through the Middle Ages, indicating that this dance was an early version of the wild-man festivities celebrated through the Middle Ages and surviving in parts of Europe through modern times.
As the name implies, the main characteristic of the wild man is his wildness. Civilized people regarded wild men as beings of the wilderness, the antithesis of civilization.
Other characteristics developed or transmuted in different contexts. From the earliest times, sources associated wild men with hairiness; by the 12th century they were almost invariably described as having a coat of hair covering their entire bodies except for their hands, feet, faces above their long beards, and the breasts and chins of the females. 

In art the hair more often covers the same areas that a chemise or dress would, except for the female&#x27;s breasts; male knees are also often hairless. As with the feather tights of angels, this is probably influenced by the costumes of popular drama. The female depiction also follows Mary Magdalene&#x27;s hair suit in art; in medieval legend this miraculously appeared when she retreated to the desert after Christ&#x27;s death, and her clothes fell apart.

===Romanesque Europe===
A wild man is described in the book &quot;Konungs skuggsjá&quot; (&quot;Speculum Regale&quot; or &quot;the King&#x27;s Mirror&quot;), written in Norway about 1250:
It once happened in that country (and this seems indeed strange) that a living creature was caught in the forest as to which no one could say definitely whether it was a man or some other animal; for no one could get a word from it or be sure that it understood human speech. It had the human shape, however, in every detail, both as to hands and face and feet; but the entire body was covered with hair as the beasts are, and down the back it had a long coarse mane like that of a horse, which fell to both sides and trailed along the ground when the creature stooped in walking.
A &quot;black and hairy&quot; forest-dwelling outcast is mentioned in the tale of &quot;Renaud de Montauban,&quot; written in the late 12th century.

===Celtic mythology===
The 9th-century Irish tale &quot;Buile Shuibhne&quot; (&quot;The Madness of Sweeney&quot;) describes how Suibhne or Sweeney, the pagan king of the Dál nAraidi in Ulster, assaults the Christian bishop Ronan Finn and is cursed with madness as a result. He begins to grow feathers and talons as the curse runs its full course, flies like a bird, and spends many years travelling naked through the woods, composing verses among other madmen. In order to be forgiven by God, King Suibhne composes a beautiful poem of praise to God before he dies. There are further poems and stories recounting the life and madness of King Suibhne. The Welsh told a similar story about Myrddin Wyllt, the origin of the Merlin of later romance. In these stories, Myrddin is a warrior in the service of King Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio at the time of the Battle of Arfderydd. When his lord is killed at the battle, Myrddin travels to the Caledonian Forest in a fit of madness which endows him with the ability to compose prophetic poetry; a number of later prophetic poems are attributed to him. &quot;The Life of Saint Kentigern&quot; includes almost the same story, though here the madman of Arfderydd is instead named Lailoken, which may be the original name. The fragmentary 16th-century Breton text &quot;An Dialog Etre Arzur Roe D&#x27;an Bretounet Ha Guynglaff&quot; (&quot;Dialog Between Arthur and Guynglaff&quot;) tells of a meeting between King Arthur and the wild man Guynglaff, who predicts events which will occur as late as the 16th century.

Geoffrey of Monmouth recounts the Myrddin Wyllt legend in his Latin &quot;Vita Merlini&quot; of about 1150, though here the figure has been renamed &quot;Merlin&quot;. According to Geoffrey, after Merlin witnessed the horrors of the battle:

===Slavic mythology===

Wild (divi) people are the characters of the Slavic folk demonology, mythical forest creatures. Names go back to two related Slavic roots &quot;*dik-&quot; and &quot;*div-&quot;, combining the meaning of &quot;wild&quot; and &quot;amazing, strange&quot;.

In the East Slavic sources referred: Saratov – leshy; a short man with a big beard and tail; Ukrainian &quot;lisovi lyudi&quot; – old men with overgrown hair who give silver to those who rub their nose; Kostroma &quot;dikiy&quot; chort; Vyatka &quot;dikonkiy&quot; unclean spirit, sending paralysis; Ukrainian &quot;lihiy div&quot; – marsh spirit, sending fever; Ukrainian Carpathian &quot;dika baba&quot; – an attractive woman in seven-league boots, sacrifices children and drinks their blood, seduces men. There are similarities between the East Slavic reports about wild people and book legends about &quot;diviy&quot; peoples (unusual people from the medieval novel &quot;Alexandria&quot;) and mythical representations of miraculous peoples. For example, Russians from Ural believe that &quot;divnye lyudi&quot; are short, beautiful, have a pleasant voice, live in caves in the mountains, can predict the future; among the Belarusians of Vawkavysk uyezd, the &quot;dzikie lyudzi&quot; – one-eyed cannibals living overseas, also drink lamb blood; among the Belarusians of Sokółka uyezd, the overseas &quot;dzikij narod&quot; have grown wool, they have a long tail and ears like an ox; they do not speak, but only squeal.

===Late Medieval===
King Charles VI of France and five of his courtiers were dressed as wild men and chained together for a &quot;masquerade&quot; at the tragic &quot;Bal des Sauvages&quot; which occurred in Paris at the Hôtel Saint-Pol, 28 January 1393. They were &quot;in costumes of linen cloth sewn onto their bodies and soaked in resinous wax or pitch to hold a covering of frazzled hemp, so that they appeared shaggy &amp; hairy from head to foot&quot;. In the midst of the festivities, a stray spark from a torch set their flammable costumes ablaze, burning several courtiers to death; the king&#x27;s own life was saved through quick action by his aunt, Joann, who covered him with her dress.

The Burgundian court celebrated a known as the (&quot;Passage of arms of the Wild Lady&quot;) in Ghent in 1470.
A knight held a series of jousts with an allegoric meaning in which the conquest of the wild lady symbolized the feats the knight must do to merit a lady.

Some early sets of playing cards have a suit of Wild Men, including a pack engraved by the Master of the Playing Cards (active in the Rhineland c. 1430–1450), some of the earliest European engravings. A set of four miniatures on the estates of society by Jean Bourdichon of about 1500 includes a wild family, along with &quot;poor&quot;, &quot;artisan&quot; and &quot;rich&quot; ones.

===Martin Schongauer&#x27;s Wild Men===
Martin Schongauer depicted wild people several times, including on four heraldic shield engravings of the 1480s which depict wild men holding the coat of arms of the print&#x27;s patrons. Each image is confined within an approximately 78 mm circular composition which is not new to Schongauer&#x27;s oeuvre. 

In &quot;Wild Man Holding a Shield with a Hare and a Shield with a Moor&#x27;s Head&quot;, the wild man holds two parallel shields, which seem to project from the groin of the central figure. The wild man supports the weight of the shields on two cliffs. The hair on the apex of the wild man&#x27;s head is adorned with twigs which project outward; as if to make a halo. The wild man does not look directly at the viewer; in fact, he looks down somberly toward the bottom right region of his circular frame. His somber look is reminiscent of that an animal trapped in a zoo as if to suggest that he is upset to have been tamed. 

There is a stark contrast between the first print and &quot;Shield with a Greyhound&quot;, held by a Wild Man as this figure stands much more confidently. Holding a bludgeon, he looks past the shield and off into the distance while wearing a crown of vines. In Schongauer&#x27;s third print, &quot;Shield with Stag Held by Wild Man&quot;, the figure grasps his bludgeon like a walking stick and steps in the same direction as the stag. He too wears a crown of vines, which trail behind into the wind toward a jagged mountaintop. 

In his fourth print, &quot;Wild Woman Holding a Shield with a Lion&#x27;s Head&quot;, Schongauer depicts a different kind of scene. This scene is more intimate. The image depicts a wild woman sitting on a stump with her suckling offspring at her breast. While the woman&#x27;s body is covered in hair her face is left bare. She also wears a crown of vines. Then, compared to the other wild men, the wild woman is noticeably disproportionate. 

Finally, each print is visually strong enough to stand alone as individual scenes, but when lined up it seems as if they were stamped out of a continuous scene with a circular die.

==Early modern representations==
The wild man was used as a symbol of mining in late medieval and Renaissance Germany. It appears in this context in the coats of arms of Naila and of Wildemann. The town of Wildemann in the Upper Harz was founded during 1529 by miners who, according to legend, met a wild man and wife when they ventured into the wilds of the Harz mountain range.

Petrus Gonsalvus (born 1537) was referred to by Ulisse Aldrovandi as &quot;the man of the woods&quot; due to his condition, hypertrichosis. Some of his children were also afflicted. It is believed that his marriage to the lady Catherine inspired the fairy tale &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1611), the dance of twelve &quot;Satyrs&quot; at the rustic sheep-shearing (IV.iv), prepared by a servant&#x27;s account:

The account conflates wild men and satyrs. Shakespeare may have been inspired by the episode of Ben Jonson&#x27;s masque &quot;Oberon, the Faery Prince&quot; (performed 1 January 1611), where the satyrs have &quot;tawnie wrists&quot; and &quot;shaggy thighs&quot;; they &quot;run leaping and making antique action.&quot;

==Modern literary representations==
The term &quot;wood-woses&quot; or simply &quot;Woses&quot; is used by J. R. R. Tolkien to describe a fictional race of wild men, the Drúedain, in his books on Middle-earth. According to Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, other men, including the Rohirrim, mistook the Drúedain for goblins or other wood-creatures and referred to them as Púkel-men (Goblin-men). He allows the fictional possibility that his Drúedain were the &quot;actual&quot; origin of the wild men of later traditional folklore. 

British poet Ted Hughes used the form &quot;wodwo&quot; as the title of a poem and a 1967 volume of his collected works.

The fictional character Tarzan from Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; 1912 novel &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot; has been described as a modern version of the wild man archetype.

==Modern documented representations==
A documented feral child was Ng Chhaidy living naked in the jungle of India; her hair and fingernails grew for 38 years until she had become a &quot;wild woman&quot;.

==Interpretation==
The Wild Man has been discussed in Freudian terms as representative of the &quot;potentialities lurking in the heart of every individual, whether primitive or civilized, as his possible incapacity to come to terms with his socially provided world.&quot;

<doc id="466766" wikidata="Q894060" url="?curid=466766" title="City of Boroondara">
<text>The City of Boroondara () is a local government area in Victoria, Australia. It is located in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It was formed in June 1994 from the amalgamation of the Cities of Kew, Camberwell and Hawthorn.

It has an area of . In June 2018 the city had a population of 181,289.

City of Boroondara participates in the Victorian Government&#x27;s state-wide, Local Government Community Satisfaction Survey. This is conducted annually by an independent research company, JWS Research. In 2022 City of Boroondara achieved an index score of 71 on ‘Overall Performance’. This is significantly higher than the average ratings for metropolitan councils (index score of 65) and the state-wide average (index score of 59) and places Boroondara in the top-performing councils metro and state-wide.

==History==
This area was originally occupied by the Wurundjeri Indigenous Australians of the Kulin nation.

In 1837, John Gardiner (after whom Gardiners Creek was named) and his family were the first Europeans to settle in the area. Robert Hoddle surveyed the area in 1837 and declared it the &quot;Parish of Boroondara&quot;. The area was densely wooded, so he took a word from the Woiwurrung language (as spoken by the Wurundjeri), meaning &quot;where the ground is thickly shaded&quot;.

The first Local Government body was the Boroondara District Road Board, formed on 11 July 1854 and incorporating the areas which were to become the City of Hawthorn, City of Kew and City of Camberwell. Hawthorn and Kew were created as separate municipalities in 1860 and the remaining area of the Road Board became Shire of Boroondara on 17 November 1871, which later became the City of Camberwell.

In the 1990s, the City of Hawthorn, the City of Kew and the western part of the City of Camberwell were originally planned to be amalgamated to form the &quot;City of Riversdale&quot;. The three municipalities, including the whole of the City of Camberwell, were eventually amalgamated in June 1994 to create the City of Boroondara. Existing councillors from the three municipalities were replaced initially by three commissioners - David Glanville (chair), David Thomas and Marion Macleod. The commissioners were in turn replaced by ten councillors following elections in 1996.

==Council==
Boroondara City Council is the third tier of government and deals with services such as waste and recycling collection, leisure centres, building and planning permits and approvals, roads, drainage, health services, youth services, children&#x27;s services, food safety, parks and gardens, library services, pets, street parking permits and the collection of rates and charges.

===Current composition and election method===

Boroondara City Council is composed of eleven councillors, each representing one of eleven wards. On Thursday 9 July 2020, the Minister for Local Government formally announced a change to Boroondara&#x27;s electoral structure. This change follows a review by the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC), which was completed in June 2019. This change included an increase in ward and councillor numbers from 10 to 11. The new 11th ward is named Riversdale Ward, and is located to the south-west where it shares a boundary with Glenferrie, Junction and Gardiner Wards. This addition resulted in a number of boundary changes across the municipality.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic threatened to disrupt the local elections, with some arguing that the inability to campaign in-person would benefit incumbents with name-recognition, or resource rich candidates who could invest in letter box campaigns with leaflets. A decision was made, on public health grounds, that it was safe to proceed with the elections and voters were only able to return their ballots via postal voting.

All councillors are elected for a fixed four-year term of office, with the most recent election being held in October 2024. Councillors were sworn in at a Special Meeting of Council on Monday 11 November 2024. The Mayor was decided in a council meeting on the 18th of November.

==Libraries==
The City of Boroondara has five libraries at Camberwell, Ashburton, Balwyn, Kew and Hawthorn, and in 2018 opened a &#x27;library lounge&#x27; at the Greythorn Community Hub in Balwyn North.

==Local area==

===Schools===

Boroondara has one of the highest concentrations of students in Australia and contains many private schools, including Xavier College, Methodist Ladies&#x27; College (MLC), Strathcona Baptist Girls&#x27; Grammar School, Camberwell Grammar School, Trinity Grammar School, Ruyton Girls&#x27; School, Rossbourne School, Carey Baptist Grammar School, Scotch College, Fintona Girls&#x27; School, Genazzano FCJ College, Preshil, and Alia College. It contains Catholic schools such as St Michael&#x27;s Parish School (Ashburton) Our Lady of Good Counsel (Deepdene) and St Bede&#x27;s School (Balwyn North) and a number of public schools, including Canterbury Girls&#x27; Secondary College, Balwyn High School, Kew High School, Auburn High School and Camberwell High School.

== Heritage controversy ==
In 2023, Boroondara implemented a &quot;community heritage nomination process&quot;, allowing residents to lodge nominations for properties to be heritage listed, limiting the ability for the owners of those properties to renovate or demolish their property. The community nominated eight properties to heritage list, seven of which were listed without the consent of the owner. This was a highly controversial change, and some residents were concerned that the process would be weaponised by community members to heritage list properties owned by people in ethnic minorities. The council rejected a proposal to pause the process until the next council election.

<doc id="466768" wikidata="Q238315" url="?curid=466768" title="Claire Denis">
<text>Claire Denis (; ; born 21 April 1946) is a French film director and screenwriter. Her feature film &quot;Beau Travail&quot; (1999) has been called one of the greatest films of the 1990s and of all time. Her work has dealt with themes of colonial and post-colonial West Africa, as well as issues in modern France, and continues to influence European cinematic identity.

Other acclaimed works include &quot;Trouble Every Day&quot; (2001), &quot;35 Shots of Rum&quot; (2008), &quot;White Material&quot; (2009), &quot;High Life&quot; (2018) and &quot;Both Sides of the Blade&quot; (2022), the last of which won her the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival. For &quot;Stars at Noon&quot; (2022), Denis won the Grand Prix at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, sharing the award with Lukas Dhont&#x27;s &quot;Close&quot;.

==Early life==
Denis was born on 21 April 1946 in Paris, but raised in colonial French Africa, where her father was a civil servant, living in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, French Somaliland, and Senegal. Her childhood was spent living in West Africa with her parents and her younger sister coloured her perspective on certain political issues. Their father told them that independence from France would be a good thing for these colonies. Her upbringing was a strong influence on her films, which have dealt with colonialism and post-colonialism in Africa. Her father moved with the family every two years because he wanted the children to learn about geography.

Growing up in West Africa, Denis used to watch old and damaged copies of war films sent from the United States. As an adolescent, she loved to read. Completing the required material while in school, at night she would sneak her mother&#x27;s detective stories to read. At age 12, Denis was diagnosed with polio and returned to France for treatment. She lived in Sceaux, a suburb of Paris, for the rest of her teenage years. During her time in France, she felt unfit for living in France. She was educated for a life in Africa, and felt completely different from everyone around her.

In 1969, Denis married a photographer she met at the age of 15, after being hired as his assistant. Due to the complex nature of having him in her private life but also as her teacher, they divorced soon after.

==Career==
Denis initially studied economics, but, she has said, &quot;It was completely suicidal. Everything pissed me off.&quot; She then briefly studied Oriental languages and married a photographer who encouraged her to quit. In 1969 Denis studied at IDHEC (L&#x27;Institut des hautes études cinématographiques – now La Fémis) with her husband&#x27;s encouragement. He told her she needed to figure out what she wanted to do. She graduated from the IDHEC and since 2002 has been a professor of film at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland.

Before applying and being accepted into IDHEC, she worked as an intern at Télé Niger. After telling everyone that she wanted to apply to IDHEC, they told her, &quot;no, don&#x27;t waste your time studying, all you need to do is make films here with us&quot;.

After graduating in 1971 and by this time divorced, Denis began working as an assistant director for many acclaimed filmmakers. Such films include Jacques Rivette&#x27;s &quot;Out 1&quot; (1971), Denis Dusan Makavejev&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Movie&quot; (1974), Robert Enrico&#x27;s &quot;The Old Gun&quot; (1974), Eduardo de Gregorio&#x27;s &quot;Sérail&quot; (1976) and Costa-Gavras&#x27;s &quot;Hanna K.&quot; (1983). After meeting Wim Wenders, Denis travelled to the U.S. to be the assistant director on &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984) and &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (1987). Wenders has said, &quot;Claire was more than ready to make her own films. It would have been a waste to let her continue working as an assistant director&quot;. By working with so many directors Denis realized she wanted to make her own films to have more independence and ownership of her work.

Denis&#x27;s feature film debut, &quot;Chocolat&quot; (1988), is a semi-autobiographical meditation about a French woman reflecting on her childhood in Cameroon and her relationship with her family&#x27;s African servant. While making it, Denis began collaborating with Jean-Pol Fargeau as a co-writer. They still work together. &quot;Chocolat&quot; was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes and praised by critics and audiences as a remarkable first film.

Denis&#x27;s second film, &quot;Man No Run&quot; (1989), is a documentary that follows a group of Cameroonian musicians, Les Têtes Brulées, touring France. It was considered an unusual second choice. Her next two narrative films were &quot;No Fear, No Die&quot; (&quot;S&#x27;en fout la mort&quot;, 1990) and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Sleep&quot; (&quot;J&#x27;ai pas sommeil&quot;, 1994). The former is about illegal cockfighting, and the latter is about a serial killer who murders elderly women, inspired by a real case. Her next film, &quot;Nénette et Boni&quot; (1996), dives into the relationship between an alienated brother and his unhappily pregnant sister.

Denis&#x27;s fifth and arguably most renowned film is &quot;Beau Travail&quot; (1999). It is about soldiers in the French Foreign Legion in Djibouti and loosely based on Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (1888). &quot;Beau Travail&quot; explores the themes of masculinity and obsession. Her next film, &quot;Trouble Every Day&quot; (2001), was a surprise, a horror film about a newlywed couple in Paris while the husband succumbs to sexually fueled cannibalism.

Of Denis&#x27;s next six films, five draw from preexisting texts and films. &quot;Friday Night&quot; (&quot;Vendredi soir&quot;, 2002) is about two strangers who spend the night together the night before the woman is supposed to move in with her current lover. It was adapted from Emmanuèle Bernheim&#x27;s novel of the same name. &quot;The Intruder&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Intrus&quot;, 2004) is based on Jean Luc Nancy&#x27;s short memoir about a man receiving a heart transplant and reconnecting with his son. &quot;35 Shots of Rum&quot; (&quot;35 rhums&quot;, 2008) is another of Denis&#x27;s most acclaimed films, about a father&#x27;s and daughter&#x27;s changing relationship. It was inspired by Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s film &quot;Late Spring&quot; (1949). Her film &quot;Bastards&quot; (&quot;Les Salauds&quot;, 2013) was inspired by Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;The Bad Sleep Well&quot; (&quot;Warui yatsu hodo yoku nemuru&quot;, 1960). &quot;Let the Sunshine In&quot; (&quot;Un beau soleil intérieur&quot;) (2017) is a romantic comedy inspired by Roland Barthes&#x27;s &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Discourse: Fragments&quot; (1977). Of these, the only film not based on preexisting text is &quot;White Material&quot; (2009), which was co-written with Marie N&#x27;Diaye. It is about a white French woman in post-colonial Africa who stays during a rising civil conflict.

With films such as &quot;US Go Home&quot; (1994), &quot;Nénette et Boni&quot;, &quot;Beau Travail&quot;, &quot;Trouble Every Day&quot;, and &quot;Vendredi soir&quot;, Denis established a reputation as a filmmaker who &quot;has been able to reconcile the lyricism of French cinema with the impulse to capture the often harsh face of contemporary France.&quot; She returned to Africa with &quot;White Material&quot;, set in an unidentified country during a civil war.

Denis has also made many short films spanning a multitude of subjects, such as &quot;Le 15 Mai&quot; (1969) while studying at IDHEC, &quot;Keep It for Yourself&quot; (1991) and &quot;Voilà l&#x27;enchaînement&quot; (2014). Her anthologies include &quot;Pour Ushari Ahmed Mahmoud&quot;, &quot;Soudan in Lest We Forget&quot; (&quot;Contre l&#x27;oubli&quot;, (1991). &quot;US Go Home&quot; (1994) is a segment in a series of hour-long films commissioned by Arte. &quot;Nice, Very Nice&quot; is a segment in &quot;À propos de Nice, la suite&quot; (1995) and &quot;Towards Nancy&quot; (&quot;Vers Nancy&quot;) in &quot;Ten Minutes Older:The Cello&quot; (2002). Her documentaries include &quot;Jacques Rivette, le veilleur&quot; (Jacques Rivette, &quot;the Watchman&quot;, 1990), &quot;Towards Mathilde&quot; (&quot;Vers Mathilde&quot;, 2005) and &quot;Venezia 70 – Future Reloaded&quot; (2013). She also made the short film &quot;Contact&quot; (2014) for a light installation by Olafur Eliasson, who helped on the production design for &quot;High Life&quot;.

Common themes in Denis&#x27;s work include obsession, desire, violence, sex, and the body. It also focuses on the feelings of being an outsider and belonging. Denis has said, &quot;For me, the monster is invisible. If there is a small thread running through all my work, it is that evil is never the other, everything is inside and never outside.&quot;

Denis is a highly collaborative filmmaker, saying in an interview, &quot;the film becomes a relationship...and that is what&#x27;s important, the relationship&quot;. The importance of collaboration can be seen throughout her work. She often recasts actors in multiple films, most notably Alex Descas, who has worked with Denis 11 times from 1990 to 2017, and Isaach de Bankolé, who appeared in three of her films from 1988 to 2009. Vincent Gallo, Béatrice Dalle, Nicolas Duvauchelle, Juliette Binoche and Grégoire Colin have also appeared in multiple Denis films. She most often collaborates with screenwriter Jean-Pol Fargeau, composer Stuart Staples of the band Tindersticks, and cinematographer Agnès Godard, whom she met in the 1970s at the Institut des hautes études cinématographiques. Asked about her screenwriting process, Denis said, &quot;I often realize I have Isaach or Grégoire or someone else in mind&quot; when writing scenes. She has also said that usually she &quot;hold[s] no auditions&quot; for her films.

Fargeau has co-written ten of Denis&#x27;s screenplays. Staples has composed eight of her films and Denis has said that he &quot;has a rapport with the body, with flesh, with desire which is very close to mine&quot;. Nelly Quettier edited &quot;I Can&#x27;t Sleep&quot;, &quot;Beau Travail&quot;, &quot;Vendredi soir&quot; and &quot;The Intruder&quot;. Judy Shrewsbury has worked on every one of Denis&#x27;s features for the last 20 years.

Agnès Godard is one of Denis&#x27;s most important collaborators, having worked on 11 of her films as a camera operator to the cinematographer in every film except &quot;White Material&quot; and &quot;High Life&quot;.

Denis has said that by collaborating with so many artists she has learned to trust the filmmaking process. She told Damon Smith: &quot;What I got from Jacques Rivette was a complete trust in filmmaking, in actors, in acting...and a taste for endangering myself a little bit...From Wim [Wenders], I got another kind of trust, a trust in feeling very free with the camera and in designing a film not with an aesthetic, but with a complete trust of a location, in the light of the day.&quot; She also gives actors considerable freedom. In &quot;Trouble Every Day&quot; there are two onscreen murders where she let Gallo and Dalle do what they wished after the first scripted bite.

Denis&#x27;s collaborations go beyond her own films, as she has appeared in other directors&#x27; films, such as Laetitia Masson&#x27;s &quot;En avoir&quot; (1995) and Tonie Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Vénus beauté&quot; (1999). She shares screenwriting credit on Yousry Nasrallah&#x27;s &quot;El Medina&quot; (2000). She also worked as an assistant director with Wim Wenders on &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984) and &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (1987), and with Jim Jarmusch on &quot;Down by Law&quot; (1986).

In 2005, Denis was a member of the jury at the 27th Moscow International Film Festival. In 2011, she was a member of the jury at the Deauville American Film Festival.

In 2006, Denis directed the video for the song &quot;Incinerate&quot; by Sonic Youth, from their album &quot;Rather Ripped&quot;.

&quot;Bastards&quot; was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. Also that year, Denis was awarded the Stockholm Lifetime Achievement Award at the Stockholm Film Festival.

Denis announced in 2015 that she was partnering with Zadie Smith for her English-language debut film, &quot;High Life&quot;. Smith eventually left the project, causing a delay in filming. Denis went on to work on &quot;Let the Sunshine In&quot;, which starred Juliette Binoche and was released in 2017.

In 2018 Denis completed and released &quot;High Life&quot;, her first English-language feature film, with Robert Pattinson cast as the lead. The film premiered at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival. It later had a limited U.S. release by American indie distributors A24. It was positively reviewed by many notable critics.

Denis has been a member of multiple film festival boards, starting with the Venice Film Festival board in 2005. In 2019, she was the president of the board of the Cinéfondation and short films at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2020, she was the president of the board of the Orizzonti section at the Venice Film Festival.

In 2025, production began on the film &quot;The Cry of the Guards&quot; with Denis as director.

==Artistry==

Most of Denis&#x27;s œuvre uses location work rather than studio work. She sometimes places her actors as if they were positioned for still photography. She uses longer takes with a stationary camera and frames things in long shots, resulting in fewer close-ups. But Denis&#x27;s cinematic and topical focus always remains relentlessly on her protagonists&#x27; faces and bodies. The subject&#x27;s body in space, and how the particular terrain, weather, and colour of the landscape influence and interact with the human subjects of her films maintain cinematic dominance.

Tim Palmer explores Denis&#x27;s work as a self-declared formalist and brilliant film stylist per se, an approach Denis has declared many times in interviews to be as much about sounds, textures, colours and compositions as broader thematic concerns or social commitments.

According to the Australian James Phillips, Denis rejects the marketable conventions of Hollywood cinema and frees the viewers of her films from the expectations of clichés.

Denis combines history with personal history, giving her films an autobiographical element. This superimposition of the personal with the historical allows her films to be described as auteur cinema. She has worked in many genres, from horror (&quot;Trouble Every Day&quot;) to romance and drama (&quot;Friday Night&quot;). Critics have noted recurring themes in her films, but Denis says she has no coherent vision of her career &quot;trajectory&quot;.

Denis has said that she is not concerned with film theory: &quot;I am not at all interested in theories about cinema. I am only interested in images and people and sound... Film theory is just a pain in the ass.&quot; She focuses on &quot;human&quot; stories, no matter the setting of the film. Denis has said she does not aim to bring about radical social change or make the viewer feel better: &quot;I&#x27;m not so sure films should be made to soothe people&#x27;s pain. I don&#x27;t want to be a social worker. I want to share something that is a vision, or a feeling.&quot; Her films&#x27; main focus is on the characters, often in moments of intense violence and emotion. &quot;Anger is part of my relation to the world,&quot; she has said. &quot;I&#x27;m filled with anger, I&#x27;m filled with regret, I&#x27;m filled with great memories, also poetic memories.&quot;

Denis has said that the body is &quot;central&quot; to her work and often uses skin, blood, and other bodily fluids to symbolize characters&#x27; feelings and highlight relationships between them. In &quot;Chocolat&quot;, skin is photographed prominently to accentuate the difference between the subservient and degrading nature of the dark-skinned Proteè&#x27;s forced outdoor bathing and the shameless confidence of pale, white Luc, who chooses to do so. In &quot;Trouble Every Day&quot; and &quot;High Life&quot;, bodily fluids are central to the stories, creating visceral disturbing images, and highlighting the films&#x27; &quot;sexuality&quot;.

Denis has directed a wide variety of films that span most known genres in her 30-year career, but is known for bending a genre&#x27;s rules, often not obeying traditional rules of pacing or cinematography for established genres like horror, science fiction, and fantasy, focusing instead on the characters, their psyches, emotions and relationships. Though she has made horror movies and romantic comedies and dramas, Denis has never been concerned with making the scariest, funniest, or most heartbreaking films; she is only interested in telling the human story.

Denis chooses the titles of her films carefully. Noëlle Rouxel-Cubberly argues that titles are intended to force the viewer to rethink a film&#x27;s imagery and that Denis uses them to describe the raw reality of her films. For example, the title of &quot;Chocolat&quot; simultaneously refers to a racist term used during the period of the film, the cocoa exportation from Africa to Europe through a slave system, and the 1950s French expression &quot;être chocolat&quot;, meaning &quot;to be cheated&quot;.

Denis is also known for &quot;shooting fast, editing slowly&quot;. In general, she does a few takes on set and spends most of her time in the editing room, creating the film there. This post-production process often involves rearranging scenes out of the order in the script. For example, she placed the dance in &quot;Beau Travail&quot; at the end of the film though it was not at the end of the script. Of this process, Denis has said, &quot;I&#x27;m always insecure when I&#x27;m making a film. I have doubts about myself but rarely about the actors.&quot;

==Political views==
In December 2023, alongside 50 other filmmakers, Denis signed an open letter published in &quot;Libération&quot; demanding a ceasefire and an end to the killing of civilians amid the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, and for a humanitarian corridor into Gaza to be established for humanitarian aid and the release of hostages.

<text>The City of Yarra is a local government area (LGA) in Victoria, Australia in the inner eastern and northern suburbs of Melbourne. It is the second smallest LGA in the state (after the Borough of Queenscliffe) with an area of , and in June 2021 it had a population of 91,543, making it the second most densely populated LGA (after the City of Port Phillip), with around 4,695 people per square kilometre. The City of Yarra was formed in 1994 as a result of the amalgamation of the former Cities of Richmond, Collingwood, Fitzroy, and parts of Carlton North (previously part of the City of Melbourne) and parts of Alphington and Fairfield (previously part of the former City of Northcote).

The administrative centre of the City of Yarra is the old Richmond Town Hall in Bridge Road, Richmond. The Collingwood Town Hall in Hoddle Street, Abbotsford is also still used by the council as secondary offices and as a service centre, and the Fitzroy Town Hall in Napier Street, Fitzroy is used for the local library and for use as a community space. Some council committees also meet at the Fitzroy and Collingwood Town Halls.

The city is culturally and socially diverse. The 2016 Australian Census found that 38.8% of residents were born outside Australia, with the largest numbers being born in England, New Zealand, Vietnam, China and Greece.

The suburbs of the City of Yarra were established in the mid-to-late 19th century and retain a Victorian appearance. The majority of housing in the city is made up of Victorian cottages or terraces or apartments built from the 1960s.

The City of Yarra has some of Melbourne&#x27;s best shopping streets. These include Bridge Road and Swan and Victoria streets in Richmond, Brunswick and Gertrude streets in Fitzroy and Smith Street in Collingwood. In 2021, Smith Street was named the coolest street in the world.

As of November 2024, the mayor is Stephen Jolly, and the deputy mayor is Labor councillor Sarah McKenzie. The CEO since June 2022 is Sue Wilkinson.

==Council==
Yarra City Council is composed of nine single-member wards. Prior to the 2024 election, it was composed of three multi-member wards with three members each, but the electoral structure changed as a result of the Local Government Act 2020. 

All councillors are elected for a fixed four-year term of office. The mayor is elected annually in November by a special meeting of the full council.

===Current composition===
The current council, elected in 2024, is:

===Mayors===
==Past councillors==
===1996–2004 (five wards)===
===2004–2024 (three wards)===
====Langridge Ward====

====Nicholls Ward====
===2024 (nine wards)===

==Australia Day==
In August 2017, the Yarra City Council voted unanimously at a town hall meeting to cancel annual Australia Day events, including citizenship ceremonies and instead hold a culturally sensitive event &quot;marking the loss of Indigenous culture&quot;. The council also voted to begin lobbying the federal government to change the date of Australia&#x27;s national day and to use council publications and media to campaign in favour of changing the date. Then Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, accused the council of &quot;using a day that should unite Australians to divide Australians&quot;. The City of Darebin later followed suit.

==Townships and localities==
In the 2021 census, the city had a population of 90,114 up from 86,657 in the 2016 census.

<text>USS &quot;Santee&quot; (CVE-29) (originally launched as AO-29, then ACV-29) was an American escort carrier. The second ship with this name, it was launched on 4 March 1939 as &quot;Esso Seakay&quot; under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 3) by the Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company at Chester, Pennsylvania, sponsored by Mrs. Charles Kurz. It was acquired by the United States Navy on 18 October 1940 and commissioned on 30 October 1940 as AO-29.

Prior to her acquisition by the Navy, &quot;Esso Seakay&quot; had been operated by Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso) on the west coast. During her commercial service, she set several records for fast oil hauling. Her original model was a type T3-S2-A1 tanker.

==World War II==
After commissioning, &quot;Santee&quot; served in the Atlantic. When American neutrality ended on 7 December 1941, &quot;Santee&quot; was carrying oil for a secret airdrome at NS Argentia, Newfoundland. In the spring of 1942, &quot;Santee&quot;″s conversion to an aircraft carrier was begun at the Norfolk Navy Yard.

===1942===
On 24 August 1942, &quot;Santee&quot; was commissioned as an escort carrier with designation ACV-29, with Commander William Sample in command. The ACV was fitted with such haste that workmen from Norfolk were still on board during her shakedown training and her decks were piled high with stores. After conversion, nominally completed on 8 September, &quot;Santee&quot; reported to Task Force 22 (TF 22) and the first plane landed on her flight deck on 24 September.

After shakedown, &quot;Santee&quot; departed Bermuda on 25 October and headed for the coast of Africa. While the escort carrier was &quot;en route&quot; on 30 October, an SBD Dauntless being launched from a catapult dropped a depth bomb onto the flight deck. It rolled off the deck and detonated close to the port bow shaking the entire ship, carrying away the rangefinder and a searchlight base, and damaging radar antennas.

Nevertheless, &quot;Santee&quot; continued steaming with Task Group 34.2 (TG 34.2). On 7 November, the escort carrier, with and and , left the formation and, the following morning, took positions off Safi, French Morocco. &quot;Santee&quot; launched planes and fueled ships until 13 November, when she rejoined TG 34.2 and returned to Bermuda. The group departed that island on 22 November and anchored in Hampton Roads, Virginia two days later.

===1943===
After voyage repairs and drydock, &quot;Santee&quot; got underway with destroyer , on 26 December. On 1 January 1943, &quot;Santee&quot; anchored at Port of Spain, Trinidad. Two days later, with &quot;Eberle&quot; and , she headed for the coast of Brazil. After disembarking passengers at Recife, she sailed to join Task Unit 23.1.6 (TU 23.1.6) at sea in tightening the noose on enemy merchant shipping and naval activity in the South Atlantic.

For a month, her planes flew anti-submarine missions and regular patrols. On 15 February, the escort carrier put in at Recife, remaining until 21 February. Back conducting routine sorties in the same manner, &quot;Santee&quot; operated from 21 February – 2 March when she again put into Recife.

Her next period at sea, which began on 4 March, brought action. On 10 March, light cruiser and destroyer &quot;Eberle&quot; were investigating a cargo liner which had been spotted by &quot;Santee&quot;″s aircraft and which had been tentatively identified as the &quot;Karin&quot;, a Dutch merchantman. It turned out to be the German blockade runner &quot;Kota Nopan&quot; (ex-Dutch &quot;Kota Pinang&quot;). As the &quot;Eberle&quot; boarding party drew alongside, explosives placed by the abandoning crew detonated, killing eight boarders. On 15 March, &quot;Santee&quot; set out for Norfolk and anchored at Hampton Roads on 28 March.

Underway again on 13 June, with destroyers , , and , &quot;Santee&quot; reached Casablanca on 3 July. Four days later, the escort carrier departed the harbor with a convoy of homeward-bound empties. No submarines were sighted, but one of her Avengers made a forced landing in Spain, and its crew was interned. &quot;Santee&quot;″s small task group left the convoy on 12 July with orders to operate independently against Nazi submarine concentrations south of the Azores. She remained at this anti-submarine work until 25 July and managed to attack seven surfaced U-boats, at the price of two Dauntlesses.

On the 25th, she joined a west-bound convoy, which reached the Virginia coast on 6 August. On 26 August, &quot;Santee&quot;, with &quot;Bainbridge&quot; and , again headed into the Atlantic; and two days steaming brought them to Bermuda.

&quot;Santee&quot; made another convoy run from Bermuda to Casablanca and back to Hampton Roads from 29 August – 13 October. On 25 October, the escort carrier departed the east coast for Casablanca, reaching Basin Delpit on 13 November. Standing out of Casablanca the next day, she rendezvoused on 17 November with battleship , carrying President Franklin D. Roosevelt. After providing air cover for the battleship and her escorts for several days, &quot;Santee&quot; was ordered to the Bay of Biscay, where she engaged in anti-submarine work until the end of November.

As TG 21.11, &quot;Santee&quot; and a trio of four-stackers patrolled the North Atlantic from 1–9 December. The group was dissolved upon arrival at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 10 December, and &quot;Santee&quot;, minus her aircraft, stood out of Norfolk on 21 December, and headed for New York in company with battleship , and several destroyers. From 22 to 28 December, the escort carrier packed her hangar and flight decks with P-38 Lightning fighter planes at Staten Island. Getting underway in convoy on 29 December, she steamed unchallenged across the North Atlantic, reaching Glasgow on 9 January 1944.

===1944===
Emptied of her P-38 cargo, &quot;Santee&quot; departed Glasgow in convoy on 13 January and returned to Norfolk on 24 January. She stood out of Norfolk on 13 February with destroyer escort , transited the Panama Canal on 18–19 February and moored at San Diego, California, on 28 February. There, she embarked 300 Navy and Marine Corps personnel and 31 aircraft for delivery to Pearl Harbor. She also took on 24 Grumman F4F Wildcats and Grumman TBF Avengers as her own air group.
Standing out of San Diego Bay on 2 March, &quot;Santee&quot; unloaded her ferried aircraft and personnel at Pearl Harbor upon her arrival on 9 March.

, , and &quot;Santee&quot;, all former oilers, swarmed out of Pearl Harbor with a flock of destroyers on 15 March, heading southwest. Designated Carrier Division 22 (CarDiv 22), they joined the fast carriers of the United States Fifth Fleet on 27 March and sped west to the Palaus. There, their planes of CarDiv 22 flew patrols over vulnerable tankers before setting course for Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides on 4 April.

In this, the closing phase of the New Guinea campaign, &quot;Santee&quot; fueled and provisioned near Espiritu Santo from 7–10 April; then sailed to Purvis Bay, Solomons on 13 April. CarDiv 22 joined CarDiv 24 and a destroyer squadron on 16 April and set course for New Guinea.

&quot;Santee&quot;″s air group aircraft aided in destroying 100 enemy aircraft and ripping up enemy airfields before the landings, prior to departing for Manus Island, Admiralties, on 24 April. Arriving at Seeadler Harbor the next day, she and her sister ships took on fuel and food; then sailed again on 26 April for Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura). From 12 May – 1 June, she traded in her own air arm for 66 F4U Corsairs and 15 F6F Hellcats and personnel of Marine Air Group 21 (MAG 21). On 2 June, CarDiv 22 started north for Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshalls. On 4 August, &quot;Santee&quot; reached newly won Guam. The 81 aircraft of MAG 21 became the first planes to operate from the reconquered island.

After training exercises and the re-embarkment of her own planes at Manus, &quot;Santee&quot; got underway on 10 September and rendezvoused with TF 77 near Mapia Island. At Morotai in the Moluccas, her Avengers bombed ground installations. One plane was lost to the enemy, but &quot;Santee&quot; herself had no contact with the Japanese. By 1 October, she was back in Seeadler Harbor.

Sailing from Manus on 12 October, &quot;Santee&quot; and accompanying combatants reached Philippine waters on 20 October. Her gunners shot down an enemy plane during an air attack that morning, and her aircraft shot down two more.

At 07:36 on 25 October, &quot;Santee&quot; launched five Avengers and eight Wildcats for an attack against Japanese surface units some to the north. At 07:40, a &quot;kamikaze&quot; – carrying what was estimated to be a bomb – crashed through the flight deck and damaged the hangar deck. At 07:56, a torpedo fired from a Japanese submarine struck the ship, causing flooding of several compartments and creating a 6° list. Emergency repairs were completed by 09:35.

Between 18 and 27 October, &quot;Santee&quot; planes shot down 31 Japanese planes and sank one ammunition ship, in addition to damage inflicted by strafing during their 377 sorties. On 31 October, she anchored in Seeadler Harbor for temporary repairs.

Underway again on 9 November, she moored at Pearl Harbor on 19 November. Following more repairs, she embarked 98 Marines for transportation to the U.S. and entered Los Angeles Harbor on 5 December. &quot;Santee&quot; completed the year undergoing repairs to battle damage and general overhaul.

===1945===
After post repair trials at San Diego, the escort carrier headed toward Hawaii on 31 January 1945, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 February. On 7 March, she got underway for Ulithi in the Western Carolines, altering her course &quot;en route&quot; to assist in the search for the B-24 Liberator which had disappeared while carrying Army Lieutenant General Millard F. Harmon, before anchoring on 19 March. Two days later &quot;Santee&quot; steamed toward Leyte Gulf.

On 27 March, &quot;Santee&quot; departed the Philippines to provide air coverage for southern transport groups Dog and Easy &quot;en route&quot; to the objective area at Okinawa Gunto for the invasion of Okinawa Jima, the largest combined operation of the Pacific war.

On Easter Sunday, 1 April 1945, &quot;Santee&quot; provided direct support to the American ground forces landing on Okinawa and she continued this duty until 8 April, when she turned to aid British carriers in denying the use of Sakishima Gunto airfields to the enemy. For 42 consecutive dawns, &quot;Santee&quot;″s aircraft winged over target sectors in the East China Sea, with daily returns to Okinawa itself for routine ground support. On 16 June, &quot;Santee&quot; launched a fighter bomber mission against specified targets on Kyūshū, Japan.

Pulling out of the Okinawa area that day, &quot;Santee&quot; reached Leyte Gulf on 19 June, where minor repairs were made. Out again on 1 July, she operated west of Okinawa from 5–14 July, covering minesweeping operations. On 7 July, a tail hook broke on a landing aircraft, allowing it to clear all barriers, crash among parked planes, and cause a fire. Four fighters and two torpedo bombers were jettisoned, six torpedo bombers were rendered non-flyable duds, and one of the pilots of the parked aircraft was killed.

&quot;Santee&quot; was detached from the task unit on 15 July and proceeded to Guam, arriving at Apra Harbor four days later. Following flight deck repairs and general upkeep, the escort carrier got underway on 5 August for Saipan, engaging in carrier aircraft training for squadrons flown from that island &quot;en route&quot;. Anchoring in Saipan Harbor on 9 August, the CVE got underway for the Philippines on 13 August. &quot;Santee&quot; received word of the cessation of the hostilities against Japan on 15 August and anchored in San Pedro Bay, Leyte, two days later.

On 4 September, while &quot;en route&quot; to Korea to support occupation forces there, &quot;Santee&quot; was ordered to northern Formosa to evacuate ex-prisoners of war. On 5 September, the escort carrier received 155 officers and men of the British and Indian Armies from destroyer escort . These soldiers had been captured by the Japanese in Malaya in 1942. They were given medical aid and berthed on the hangar deck. The next day, &quot;Santee&quot; picked up additional men from and , making a total of 322 officers and men. They included 30 American Army and Navy officers and men who had been taken on Bataan and Corregidor, and 10 officers and men from the Dutch Army and Merchant Marine, captured in Java. On 9 September, &quot;Santee&quot; disembarked the 477 evacuees at Manila Bay.

Five days later, &quot;Santee&quot; stood out of Manila Bay and steamed for Okinawa, anchoring at Buckner Bay on 19 September. Underway again the next day, &quot;Santee&quot; reached Wakanoura Wan, Honshū, Japan, on 22 September. From 24 to 26 September, &quot;Santee&quot; steamed along the coast, providing air coverage for occupation forces landing at Wakayama.

==Post-war==
&quot;Santee&quot; departed Wakanoura Wan on 3 October, leaving her formation on 6 October to search for a missing PBM Mariner flying boat carrying Rear Admiral William D. Sample, the ship&#x27;s first commanding officer after her conversion to an escort carrier.

On 20 October, &quot;Santee&quot; got underway for Okinawa, arriving two days later at Buckner Bay. On 23 October, &quot;Santee&quot; got underway for Pearl Harbor, disembarking 375 passengers there on 4 November. The next day, &quot;Santee&quot; continued her role in &quot;Operation Magic Carpet&quot; by embarking 18 Marines bound for the west coast.

Anchoring at San Diego on 11 November, &quot;Santee&quot; remained there until 26 November, when she got underway for Guam on additional &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; duty.

On 27 February 1946, &quot;Santee&quot; departed San Diego and arrived at Boston Harbor on 25 March, via the Panama Canal. The CVE was placed in reserve on 21 October. &quot;Santee&quot; was reclassified on 12 June 1955 as an escort helicopter aircraft carrier, CVHE-29, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959. On 5 December, she was sold to the Master Metals Company for scrap.

==Awards==
&quot;Santee&quot; received nine battle stars and the Presidential Unit Citation for her World War II service.

<text>Rose&#x27;s lime juice, often known simply as Rose&#x27;s, is a sweetened concentrated fruit juice patented in 1867. This was the world&#x27;s first commercially produced fruit concentrate.

==Background==
In 1753, James Lind discovered that consuming citrus fruits cured people affected by scurvy, a disease rife throughout the British Navy, whose seamen often went weeks without eating fresh produce.

Limes were preferred to all other citrus fruits, not because of higher vitamin C, but because they were easier to preserve.

From 1795, it became normal practice throughout all long voyages within the Royal Navy, for sailors to receive a daily ration of lemon or lime juice. This quickly gave rise to the nickname &quot;limeys&quot; amongst non-British sailors. The preservation of the fruit juice was usually done through the addition of 15% rum.

== History ==

Lauchlan Rose (1829–1885), a ship chandler in Leith, began a process for preserving lime juice in 1865 and patented this method to preserve citrus juice without alcohol in 1867. He had realised that preserving the juice with sugar rather than alcohol opened the product up to a far wider market.

The first factory producing lime juice was set up as &quot;L. Rose &amp; Co.&quot; on Commercial Street in Leith, Scotland, in 1868. This was located adjacent to the Old East Dock built during the Napoleonic War. This aided both the supply of limes (which do not grow in the UK), and its proximity to what was then Scotland&#x27;s principal harbour for the Royal Navy. The limes at this time largely came from Dominica in the West Indies. In 1893, Rose purchased plantations there to ensure his supply. This was further supplemented by plantations from Africa from the region now called Ghana.

In 1875, the company had grown so much that it built and moved its headquarters to new premises in London (though still retaining its Leith production).

In the 20th century, Rose faced some competition, namely from A. C. Shillingford &amp; Co. At this time Albert Cavendish Shillingford was the leading Dominican businessman of colour. Shillingford grew and then processed limes out of 2 factories in Dominica, later expanding to neighbouring islands constructing lime processing plants in Trinidad and Grenada. This expansion broke the monopoly &quot;L. Rose &amp; Co.&quot; held, meaning local growers of yellow limes secured better prices for their produce.

In 1940, during The Blitz, L. Rose &amp; Co moved its headquarters from the London docks (a key German target) to St. Albans. After the end of World War II, the company saw its market share in the UK grow. In 1957, Schweppes acquired the company and operated it in the UK until it purchased Mott&#x27;s in 1982. Cadbury Schweppes merged the operations of the two brands in the United States and Rose&#x27;s US products became domestically produced.

When Cadbury divested its US beverage operations in 2008, Rose&#x27;s was transferred to the newly formed Keurig Dr Pepper.

==Product==

In the United Kingdom, Rose&#x27;s Lime Juice Cordial is manufactured and distributed by Coca-Cola Enterprises Ltd. In New Zealand, the label states it is made under &quot;the authority&quot; of Schweppes Holdings Ltd by Coca-Cola Amatil (NZ). It also bears the notation that Schweppes Holdings Ltd holds a Royal Warrant to HM Queen Elizabeth II as manufacturers of Schweppes and Rose&#x27;s soft drinks.

The majority of limes are now sourced from Mexico and Peru.
The ingredients in the modern US product, listed in order of concentration are water, high fructose corn syrup, lime juice concentrate, sodium metabisulfite (preservative #223), natural flavors, Blue 1. Comparatively, in New Zealand, the list is water, lime juice from concentrate (32%), sugar, food acid 330, and preservative 223 – and when mixed 1:4 (20% concentrate), contains 6.4% fruit juice.

== Brands ==
Over its history the company added other products 
to its line-up, including a non-alcoholic triple sec, grenadine, and sweet and sour. The company added a line of flavoured martini drink mixers in the early 2000s. In 2006, the company expanded its product line to feature a brand of mojito flavourings.

A licensed brand of lime marmalade is also produced in the United Kingdom, and a lemon cordial is also available in New Zealand. A passion fruit cordial is available in South Africa. 

The current range includes both the original concentrated squash or cordial and also diluted drink mixers.

<doc id="466785" wikidata="Q11160374" url="?curid=466785" title="School psychology">
<text>School psychology is a field that applies principles from educational psychology, developmental psychology, clinical psychology, community psychology, and behavior analysis to meet the learning and behavioral health needs of children and adolescents. It is an area of applied psychology practiced by a school psychologist. They often collaborate with educators, families, school leaders, community members, and other professionals to create safe and supportive school environments.

They carry out psychological testing, psychoeducational assessment, intervention, , counseling, and consultation in the ethical, legal, and administrative codes of their profession.

==Historical foundations==
School psychology dates back to the beginning of American psychology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The field is tied to both functional and clinical psychology. School psychology actually came out of functional psychology. School psychologists were interested in childhood behaviors, learning processes, and dysfunction with life or in the brain itself. They wanted to understand the causes of the behaviors and their effects on learning. 

In addition to its origins in functional psychology, school psychology is also the earliest example of clinical psychology, beginning around 1890. While both clinical and school psychologists wanted to help improve the lives of children, they approached it in different ways. School psychologists were in fact concerned with school learning and childhood behavioral problems, which largely contrasts the mental health focus of clinical psychologists.

Another significant event in the foundation of school psychology as it is today was the Thayer Conference. The Thayer Conference was first held in August 1954 in West Point, New York in Hotel Thayer. The 9 day-long conference was conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA). The purpose of the conference was to develop a position on the roles, functions, and necessary training and credentialing of a school psychologist. At the conference, forty-eight participants that represented practitioners and trainers of school psychologists discussed the roles and functions of a school psychologist and the most appropriate way to train them.

At the time of the Thayer Conference, school psychology was still a very young profession with only about 1,000 school psychology practitioners. One of the goals of the Thayer Conference was to define school psychologists. The agreed upon definition stated that school psychologists were psychologists who specialize in education and have specific knowledge of assessment and learning of all children. School psychologists use this knowledge to assist school personnel in enriching the lives of all children. This knowledge is also used to help identify and work with children with exceptional needs. It was discussed that a school psychologist must be able to assess and develop plans for children considered to be at risk. A school psychologist is also expected to better the lives of all children in the school; therefore, it was determined that school psychologists should be advisors in the planning and implementation of school curriculum.
Participants at the conference felt that since school psychology is a specialty, individuals in the field should have completed a two-year graduate training program or a four-year doctoral program. Participants felt that states should be encouraged to establish certification standards to ensure proper training. It was also decided that a practicum experience be required to help facilitate experiential knowledge within the field.

The Thayer Conference is one of the most significant events in the history of school psychology because it was there that the field was initially shaped into what it is today. Before the Thayer Conference defined school psychology, practitioners used seventy-five different professional titles. By providing one title and a definition, the conference helped to get school psychologists recognized nationally. Since a consensus was reached regarding the standards of training and major functions of a school psychologist, the public can now be assured that all school psychologists are receiving adequate information and training to become a practitioner. It is essential that school psychologists meet the same qualifications and receive appropriate training nationwide. These essential standards were first addressed at the Thayer Conference. At the Thayer Conference some participants felt that in order to hold the title of a school psychologist an individual must have earned a doctoral degree.

The issues of titles, labels, and degree levels are still debated among psychologists today. However, APA and NASP reached a resolution on this issue for the US in 2010.

==Social reform in the early 1900s==
The late 19th century marked the era of social reforms directed at children. It was due to these social reforms that the need for school psychologists emerged. These social reforms included compulsory schooling, juvenile courts, child labor laws as well as a growth of institutions serving children. Society was starting to &quot;change the &#x27;meaning of children&#x27; from an economic source of labor to a psychological source of love and affection&quot;. Historian Thomas Fagan argues that the preeminent force behind the need for school psychology was compulsory schooling laws. Prior to the compulsory schooling law, only 20% of school aged children completed elementary school and only 8% completed high school. Due to the compulsory schooling laws, there was an influx of students with mental and physical defects who were required by law to be in school. There needed to be an alternative method of teaching for these different children. Between 1910 and 1914, schools in both rural and urban areas created small special education classrooms for these children. From the emergence of special education classrooms came the need for &quot;experts&quot; to help assist in the process of child selection for special education. Thus, school psychology was founded.

==Important contributors to the founding==

===Lightner Witmer===
Lightner Witmer has been acknowledged as the founder of school psychology. Witmer was a student of both Wilhelm Wundt and James Mckeen Cattell. While Wundt believed that psychology should deal with the average or typical performance, Cattell&#x27;s teachings emphasized individual differences. Witmer followed Cattell&#x27;s teachings and focused on learning about each individual child&#x27;s needs. Witmer opened the first psychological and child guidance clinic in 1896 at the University of Pennsylvania. Witmer&#x27;s goal was to prepare psychologists to help educators solve children&#x27;s learning problems, specifically those with individual differences. Witmer became an advocate for these special children. He was not focused on their deficits per se, but rather helping them overcome them, by looking at the individual&#x27;s positive progress rather than all they still could not achieve. Witmer stated that his clinic helped &quot;to discover mental and moral defects and to treat the child in such a way that these defects may be overcome or rendered harmless through the development of other mental and moral traits&quot;. He strongly believed that active clinical interventions could help to improve the lives of the individual children.

Since Witmer saw much success through his clinic, he saw the need for more experts to help these individuals. Witmer argued for special training for the experts working with exceptional children in special educational classrooms. He called for a &quot;new profession which will be exercised more particularly in connection with educational problems, but for which the training of the psychologist will be a prerequisite&quot;.

As Witmer believed in the appropriate training of these school psychologists, he also stressed the importance of appropriate and accurate testing of these special children. The IQ testing movement was sweeping through the world of education after its creation in 1905. However, the IQ test negatively influenced special education. The IQ test creators, Lewis Terman and Henry Goddard, held a nativist view of intelligence, believing that intelligence was inherited and difficult if not impossible to modify in any meaningful way through education. These notions were often used as a basis for excluding children with disabilities from the public schools. Witmer argued against the standard pencil and paper IQ and Binet type tests in order to help select children for special education. Witmer&#x27;s child selection process included observations and having children perform certain mental tasks.

===Granville Stanley Hall===
Another important figure to the origin of school psychology was Granville Stanley Hall. Rather than looking at the individual child as Witmer did, Hall focused more on the administrators, teachers and parents of exceptional children. He felt that psychology could make a contribution to the administrator system level of the application of school psychology. Hall created the child study movement, which helped to invent the concept of the &quot;normal&quot; child. Through Hall&#x27;s child study, he helped to work out the mappings of child development and focused on the nature and nurture debate of an individual&#x27;s deficit. Hall&#x27;s main focus of the movement was still the exceptional child despite the fact that he worked with atypical children.

===Arnold Gesell===
Bridging the gap between the child study movement, clinical psychology and special education, Arnold Gesell, was the first person in the United States to officially hold the title of school psychologist. He successfully combined psychology and education by evaluating children and making recommendations for special teaching. Arnold Gesell paved the way for future school psychologists.

===Gertrude Hildreth===
Gertrude Hildreth was a psychologist with the Lincoln School at Teacher&#x27;s College, Columbia then at Brooklyn College in New York. She authored many books including the first book pertaining to school psychology titled, &quot;Psychological Service for School Problems&quot; written in 1930. The book discussed applying the science of psychology to address the perceived problems in schools. The main focus of the book was on applied educational psychology to improve learning outcomes. Hildreth listed 11 problems that can be solved by applying psychological techniques, including: instructional problems in the classroom, assessment of achievement, interpretation of test results, instructional groupings of students for optimal outcomes, vocational guidance, curriculum development, and investigations of exceptional pupils. Hildreth emphasized the importance of collaboration with parents and teachers. She is also known for her development of the Metropolitan Readiness Tests and for her contribution to the Metropolitan Achievement test. In 1933 and 1939 Hildreth published a bibliography of Mental Tests and Rating Scales encompassing a 50-year time period and over 4,000 titles. She wrote approximately 200 articles and bulletins and had an international reputation for her work in education.

== Controversies and debates ==

=== Assessment process ===
Empirical evidence has not confirmed biases in referral, assessment, or identification. Some have claimed that a better assessment process would not necessarily focus on if a student qualifies for a special education program, but rather the unique learning style of each student, and how to best help them succeed.

The National Research Council has called attention to the questionable reliability of educational decision making in special education as there can be vast numbers of false positives and/or false negatives. Misidentified students in special education is problematic and can contribute to long term negative outcomes. The effects of these outcomes differs based on many factors, including race or location.

During the identification process, school psychologists must consider ecological factors and environmental context such as socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic status may limit funding and materials, impact curriculum quality, increase teacher-to-student ratios, and perpetuate a negative school climate.

=== Technology ===
With the ever growing use of technology, school psychologists are faced with several issues, both ethical and within the populations they try to serve. As it is so easy to share and communicate over technology, concerns are raised as to just how easy it is for outsiders to get access to the private information that school psychologists deal with every day. Thus exchanging and storing information digitally may come under scrutiny if precautions such as password protecting documents and specifically limiting access within school systems to personal files.

Another issue is that of how students communicate using this technology. There are both concerns on how to address these virtual communications and on how appropriate it is to access them. Concerns on where the line can be drawn on where intervention methods end and invasion of privacy begin are raised by students, parents, administrators, and faculty. Addressing these behaviors becomes even more complicated when considering the current methods of treatment for problematic behaviors, and implementation of these strategies can become complex, if not impossible, within the use of technology.

=== Racial disproportionality in special education ===

Disproportionality refers to a group&#x27;s under or overrepresentation in comparison to other groups within a certain context. In the field of school psychology, disproportionality of minority students in special education is a concern. Special Education Disproportionality has been defined as the relationship between one&#x27;s membership to a specific group and the probability of being placed in a specific disability category. Systemic prejudice is believed by some to be one of the root causes of the mischaracterization of minority children as being disabled or problematic. &quot;Research on disproportionality in the U.S. context has posited two overlapping types of rationales: those who believed disproportionate representation is linked to poverty and health outcomes versus those who believed in the systemwide racist practices that contributed to over-representation of minority students.&quot;

The United States Congress recently received an annual report on the implementation of IDEA which stated that proportionally Native Americans (14.09%) and African Americans (12.61%) were the two most highly represented racial groups within the realm of special education. In particular, African American males have been overidentified as having emotional disturbances and intellectual disabilities. They account for 21% of the special education population with emotional disturbances and 12% with learning disabilities. American Indian and Alaska Native students are also overrepresented in special education. They are shown to be 1.53 times more likely to receive services for various learning disabilities and 2.89 more likely to obtain services targeting developmental delays than all other Non-Native American student groups combined. Overall, Hispanic students are often overidentified for special education in general; however, it is common for them to be under-identified for Autism Spectrum Disorder and speech and language impairments in comparison to White students.

Minority populations often have an increased susceptibility to economic, social and cultural disadvantages that can affect academic achievement. According to the US Department of Education, &quot;Black children were three times as likely to live in poor families as white children in 2015. 12 percent of white and Asian children lived in poor families, compared with 36 percent of black children, 30 percent of Hispanic children, 33 percent of American Indian children, and 19 percent of others.&quot; There may be other alternative explanations for behavior and academic performance as well. For example, Black children are twice as likely as Whites to experience heightened levels of lead in the blood due to prolonged lead exposure. Lead poisoning can be known to affect a child&#x27;s behavior by increasing their levels of irritability, hyperactivity, and inattentiveness even in less severe cases.

=== Cultural bias ===
Some school psychologists realize the need to understand and accept their own cultural beliefs and values in order to understand the impact it may have when delivering services to clients and families. For example, these school psychologists ensure that students who are minorities, including African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans are being equally represented at the system level, in the classroom, and receiving a fair education.

For staff, it is important to look at one&#x27;s own culture while seeing the value in diversity. Making sure that each individual student has an equal opportunity for education can greatly increase the general quality of that education. It is also vital to learn how to adapt to diversity and integrate a comprehensive way to understand cultural knowledge. Staff members should keep the terms race, privilege, implicit bias, micro aggression, and cultural relevance in mind when thinking about social justice.

== Services==

=== Intervention ===
One of the primary roles and responsibilities of school psychologists working in schools is to develop and implement programs geared towards the optimal learning and mental well being of students. School psychologists call these programs &#x27;interventions&#x27; when they are implemented in response to a significant issue affecting one or more students. Interventions in school psychology are typically classified as &quot;direct&quot; when practitioners work with students to rectify their own academic or behavioral problems and as &quot;indirect&quot; when they collaborate with the student&#x27;s family or teachers to correct academic or behavioral problems. Popular intervention formats include individual meetings, school assemblies, parent-teacher conferences, workshops, and awareness campaigns. After significant developments in related psychological fields over the latter half of the twentieth century, school psychologists have begun to move towards intervention frameworks that center on individually tailored assessments and evidence-based interventions, rather than diagnosed disabilities. This is part of a larger movement to expand the role of school psychologists outside of special education.

School psychologists, as researchers and practitioners, can make important contributions to the development and implementation of scientifically based intervention and prevention programs to address learning and behavioral needs of students. Newly designed interventions must be empirically tested through a series of randomized studies conducted by researchers in order to be proven effective for school environments. Evidence-based interventions, known within the field as EBIs, while widely circulated amongst researchers, can be difficult to implement within school environments. This is due in small part to the fledgling nature of school psychology as a field, but also due to the difference between research settings and clinical or classroom settings, with the later being generally more unpredictable and vulnerable to outside influences than the former. Thus, practitioners often modify research-based interventions in order to suit the particular needs of a student or student population.

Intervention and prevention research needs to address a range of questions related not only to efficacy and effectiveness, but also to feasibility given resources, acceptability, social validity, integrity, and sustainability.

A specific example of an intervention that has recently become popular among school psychologists is the School-Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS) intervention. The SWPBIS involves a communal effort among school staff to establish school-wide behavioral expectations, which are reinforced by reward systems in order to promote positive forms of coaching and mentorship. Authorized under Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDIEA), the SWPBIS system has been implemented in over 25,000 schools as of 2018. Like other Evidence-based interventions, the SWPBIS has a large body of research supporting its effectiveness in promoting positive academic and interpersonal behaviors among students.

School psychologists are involved in the implementation of academic, behavioral, and social/emotional interventions within a school across a continuum of supports. These systems and policies should convey clear behavior expectations and promote consistency among educators. Continuous reinforcement of positive behaviors can yield extremely positive results. Schoolwide positive behavior supports A systematic approach that proactively promotes constructive behaviors in a school can yield positive outcomes. These programs are designed to improve and support students’ social, behavioral, and learning outcomes by promoting a positive school climate and providing targeted training to students and educators within a school. Data should be collected consistently to assess implementation effectiveness, screen and monitor student behavior, and develop or modify action plans.

Check and Connect

C&amp;C is a structured mentoring intervention to promote student success and engagement at school with learning through relationship building and systematic use of data. It is structured to maximize personal contact and opportunities to build trusting relationships. It was developed in 1990 at the Institute on Community Integration University of Minnesota in collaboration with the Minneapolis Public School System. It emphasizes school completion, with academic, social, and emotional competencies. Students may be referred to the program if they exhibit signs of withdrawal in academic, emotional, or behavioral areas. The team consists of the student, check and connect coordinator, community services, school staff, monitor, and family. The essential components of this intervention are the mentor component, the check component, and the connect component. The program is implemented by a monitor, who serves multiple roles as a mentor, an advocate, and a service coordinator. These serve to build a strong relationship with the student based on mutual trust and open communication, nurtured through a long-term commitment focused on success at school and with learning. The &quot;check&quot; component is observed from the student levels of engagement. These are things such as attendance, suspension, credits, grades, and behavior that are “checked” for progress regularly by mentors and used to guide their efforts to increase and maintain students’ “connection” with the school. The &quot;connect&quot; component is timely, personalized, data-based interventions designed to provide support tailored to individual student needs, based on the student&#x27;s level of engagement with school. The monitor’s goal is to make education a priority for withdrawn students. This intervention gives students a person to motivate, encourage, and inform them on how important graduating is.

==== Academic interventions ====
Academic interventions can be conceptualized as a set of procedures and strategies designed to improve student performance with the intent of closing the gap between how a student is currently performing and the expectations of how they should be performing. Short term and long term interventions used within a problem-solving model must be evidence-based. This means the intervention strategies must have been evaluated by research that utilized rigorous data analysis and peer review procedures to determine the effectiveness. Implementing evidence-based interventions for behavior and academic concerns requires significant training, skill development, and supervised practice. Linking assessment and intervention is critical for determining that the correct intervention has been chosen. School psychologists have been specifically trained to ensure that interventions are implemented with integrity to maximize positive outcomes for children in a school setting.

===Assessment===
Historically, the main role of school psychologists has been to assess and diagnose students with behavioral or learning disabilities and determine their eligibility for exceptional needs programs. Within the contemporary field, the roles and responsibilities of individual practitioners have expanded significantly beyond the service of special needs students; however, assessment remains a central service performed by school psychologists.

Current trends in the field of school psychology call for practitioners to move away from IQ-based assessment practices and encourage assessments that consider students’ individual profiles and attainable, more tailored intervention practices. Individualized education programs (IEPs) are reports summarizing the student’s current performance, goals to guide the student’s progress, and proposed resources to meet any special educational needs.

School psychologists are equipped to provide assessment and to determine when an assessment is warranted. School psychologist have completed in depth advanced preparation in selecting and administering tests as well as interpreting and evaluating information obtained from assessment. Advanced training allows school psychologists to be extremely familiar with the central principles of measurement employing multi-method, multi-source, and multi-setting approaches that are sensitive to contextual influences. They select and use the most appropriate assessment instruments and techniques, for the purpose for which they were designed, and for which there is supporting psychometric evidence. School psychologists are aware of the limitations of assessment and the information that is collected, interpreted, and reported. School psychologists use assessment information in a manner that minimizes the potential for misunderstanding and misuse. School psychologists play a substantial role in data-driven decision-making in each of the following areas: routine decisions, screening, progress monitoring, problem identification, school-wide decisions, problem analysis for instruction, problem analysis for intervention planning, program evaluation, accountability, eligibility, and diagnostic decisions.

===Systems-level services===
Leaders in the field of school psychology recognize the practical challenges that school psychologists face when striving for systems-level change and have highlighted a more manageable domain within a systems-level approach – the classroom. Overall, it makes sense for school psychologists to devote considerable effort to monitoring and improving school and classroom-based performance for all children and youth because it has been shown to be an effective preventive approach.

==== Universal screening ====
School psychologists play an important role in supporting youth mental wellness, but identifying youth who are in distress can be challenging. Some schools have implemented universal mental health screening programs to help school psychologists find and help struggling youth. For instance, schools in King County, Washington are using the Check Yourself digital screening tool designed by Seattle Children&#x27;s Hospital to measure, understand, and nurture individual students’ well-being. Check Yourself collects information about lifestyle, behaviour, and social determinants of health to identify at-risk youth so that school psychologists can intervene and direct youth to the services they need. Mental health screening provides school psychologists with valuable insights so that interventions are better fitted to student needs.

====Crisis intervention====
Crisis intervention is an integral part of school psychology. School administrators view school psychologists as the school&#x27;s crisis intervention &quot;experts&quot;. Crisis events can significantly affect a student&#x27;s ability to learn and function effectively. Many school crisis response models suggest that a quick return to normal rituals and routines can be helpful in coping with crises. The primary goal of crisis interventions is to help crisis-exposed students return to their basic abilities of problem-solving so the student can return to their pre-crisis level of functioning.

==== Prevention ====
A way in which school psychologists can help students is by creating primary prevention programs. Information about prevention should also be connected to current events in the community.

=== Social Justice ===
The three major elements that comprise social justice include equity, fairness, and respect. The concept of social justice includes all individuals having equal access to opportunities and resources. A major component behind social justice is the idea of being culturally aware and sensitive. American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) both have ethical principles and codes of conduct that present aspirational elements of social justice that school psychologists may abide by. Although ethical principles exist, there is federal legislation that acts accordingly to social justice. For example, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA) address issues such as poverty and disability to promote the concept of social justice in schools.

Schools are becoming increasingly diverse with growing awareness of these differences. Cultural diversity factors that can be addressed through social justice practice include race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), religion, and sexual orientation. With the various elements that can impact a student&#x27;s education and become a source of discrimination, there is a greater call for the practice of social justice in schools. School psychologists that consider the framework of social justice know that injustices that low SES students face can sometimes be different when compared to high SES students.

=== Advocacy ===
A major role of school psychologists involves advocating and speaking up for individuals as needed. Advocacy can be done at district, regional, state, or national level. School psychologists advocate for students, parents, and caregivers.

Consultation and collaboration are key components of school psychology and advocacy. There may be times when school personnel may not agree with the school psychologist. Differing opinions can be problematic because a school psychologist advocates for what is in the best interest of the student. School psychologists and staff members can help facilitate awareness through courageous conversations.

=== Multicultural competence ===
School psychologists offer many types of services in order to be multiculturally competent. Multicultural competence extends to race, ethnicity, social class, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, age, and geographic region. Because the field of school psychology serves such a diverse range of students, maintaining representation for minority groups continues to be a priority. Despite such importance, history has seen an underrepresentation of culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) school psychologists. which may appear alarming given that the diversity of our youth continues to increase exponentially. Thus, current professionals in the field have prioritized the acquisition of CLD school psychologists. School psychologists are trained to use their skills, knowledge, and professional practices in promoting diversity and advocating for services for all students, families, teachers, and schools. School psychologists may also work with teachers and educators to provide an integrated multicultural education classroom and curriculum that allows more students to be represented in learning. Efforts to increase multicultural perspectives among school psychologists have been on the rise to account for the increased diversity within schools. Such efforts include establishing opportunities for individuals representative of minority groups to become school psychologists and implementing a diverse array of CLD training programs within the field.

== Education ==
In order to become a school psychologist, one must first learn about school psychology by successfully completing a graduate-level training program. A B.A. or B.S. is not sufficient.

===United States ===
School psychology training programs are housed in university schools of education or departments of psychology. School psychology programs require courses, practica, and internships.

==== Degree requirements ====
Specific degree requirements vary across training programs. School psychology training programs offer masters-level (M.A., M.S., M.Ed.), specialist-level degrees (Ed.S., Psy.S., SSP, CAGS), and doctoral-level degrees (Ph.D., Psy.D. or Ed.D.) degrees. Regardless of degree title, a supervised internship is the defining feature of graduate-level training that leads to certification to practice as a school psychologist.

Specialist-level training typically requires 3–4 years of graduate training including a 9-month (1200 hour) internship in a school setting.

Doctoral-level training programs typically require 5–7 years of graduate training. Requirements typically include more coursework in core psychology and professional psychology, more advanced statistics coursework, involvement in research endeavors, a doctoral dissertation, and a one-year (1500+ hour) internship (which may be in a school or other settings such as clinics or hospitals).

In the past, a master&#x27;s degree was considered the standard for practice in schools. As of 2017, the specialist-level degree is considered the entry-level degree in school psychology. Masters-level degrees in school psychology may lead to obtaining related credentials (such as Educational Diagnostician, School Psychological Examiner, School Psychometrist) in one or two states.

===International===

In the UK, the similar practice and study of School Psychology is more often termed Educational Psychology and requires a doctorate (in Educational Psychology) which then enables individuals to register and subsequently practice as a licensed educational psychologist.

== Employment in the United States ==
In the United States, job prospects in school psychology are excellent. Across all disciplines of psychology, the abundance of opportunities is considered among the best for both specialist and doctoral level practitioners. They mostly work in schools. Other settings include clinics, hospitals, correctional facilities, universities, and independent practice.

=== Demographic information ===
According to the NASP Research Committee, 87.5% of school psychologists are female with an average age of 42.7. In 2004–05, average earnings for school practitioners ranged from $56,262 for those with a 180-day annual contract to $68,764 for school psychologists with a 220-day contract. In 2009–10, average earnings for school practitioners ranged from $64,168 for those with a 180-day annual contract to $71,320 for school psychologists with a 200-day contract. In 2019–2020, average earnings for full-time practitioners ranged from $65,397 to $81,458, with a median of $74,000. For university faculty in school psychology, the salary estimate is $77,801.

Based on surveys performed by NASP in 2020–2021, it&#x27;s shown that 85.7% of school psychologists are white, while minority races and those who chose not to identify their race making up the remaining 14.3%. Of this remaining percentage, the next largest populations represented in school psychology are African-American and multiracial people, at 3.9% and 2.7%, respectively.

=== Shortages in the Field ===
There is a lack of trained school psychologists within the field. While jobs are available across the country, there are just not enough people to fill them.

Due to the low supply and high demand of school psychologists, being a school psychologist is very demanding. School psychologists may feel under pressure to supply adequate mental health and intervention services to the students in their care. Burnout is a risk of being a school psychologist. This risk has increased in recent years due to a shortage of school psychologists nationwide, increases in school enrollment in small cities, and the mental health effects that the COVID-19 pandemic had on children of all ages.

In January, 2022, NASP published updated statistics on the shortages of school psychologists nationwide and per state. NASP states that the recommended ratio of students to school psychologists is 500 to 1, however the national ratio for the 2020-2021 school year was 1162 students per 1 school psychologist. States that currently have the largest ratio between students and school psychologists (&gt;2000 to 1, respectively) are Texas, New Mexico, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. Alabama has the largest disparity of any state: 369,280 students to 1 school psychologist. As of the publication of this data, Connecticut is the only state meeting NASP standards of a ratio of up to 500 students per 1 school psychologist.

==== Bilingual School Psychologists ====
Approximately 21% of school-age children ages 5–7 speak a language other than English. For this reason, there is an enormous demand for bilingual school psychologists in the United States. The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) does not currently offer bilingual certification in the field. However, there are a number of professional training opportunities that bilingual LSSPs/School Psychologists can attend in order to prepare to adequately administer assessments. In addition, there are 7 NASP-Approved school psychology programs that offer a bilingual specialization: 
* Brooklyn College-City University of New York- Specialist Level
* Gallaudet University- Specialist Level
* Queens College-City University of New York- Specialist Level
* San Diego State University- Specialist Level
* Texas State University- Specialist Level
* University of Colorado Denver- Doctoral Level
* Fordham University- Lincoln Center- Doctoral Level
New York and Illinois are the only two states that offer a bilingual credential for school psychologists.

== School psychology internationally ==
The role of a school psychologist in the United States and Canada may differ considerably from the role of a school psychologist elsewhere. Especially in the United States, the role of school psychologist has been closely linked to public law for education of students with disabilities. In most other nations, this is not the case. Despite this difference, many of the basic functions of a school psychologist, such as consultation, intervention, and assessment are shared by most school psychologists worldwide.

It is difficult to estimate the number of school psychologists worldwide. Recent surveys indicate there may be around 76,000 to 87,000 school psychologists practicing in 48 countries, including 32,300 in the United States and 3,500 in Canada. Following the United States, Turkey has the next largest estimated number of school psychologists (11,327), followed by Spain (3,600), and then both Canada and Japan (3,500 each).

== Credentialing in the United States ==
In most states (excluding Texas and Hawaii), a state education agency credentials school psychologists for practice in the schools.

The Nationally Certified School Psychologist (NCSP) credential is offered by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP). The NCSP credential is an example of a non-practice credential as holding the NCSP does not make one eligible to provide services without first meeting the state requirements to work as a school psychologist.

State psychology boards (which may go by different names in each state) also offer credentials for school psychologists in some states. For example, Texas offers the LSSP credential which permits licensees to deliver school psychological services within public and private schools.

== Subspecializations in the United States ==

=== Pediatric School Psychology ===
Pediatric School Psychology is a sub-specialty that includes competencies of school, educational, and health psychology. Pediatric school psychologists bring knowledge of human learning and development, as well as understanding of school systems, chronic health conditions, and bio-psycho-social influences. Pediatric school psychologists work across multiple settings and share similar roles. Both professionals focus on prevention and intervention efforts related to students’ behavior, education, and physical health. Additionally, pediatric school psychologists can simplify collaboration between school systems, healthcare providers, and family systems to address the academic, social-emotional, behavioral, and overall health of students. Pediatric school psychologists also contribute to developing and maintaining Tier 1 prevention activities and the facilitation of health promotion programs structured to address the population they are serving.

The field of Pediatric School Psychology is relatively new and requires doctoral level education. Traditional school psychology training programs are beginning to endorse pediatric school psychology subspecializations. For example, the University of South Florida requires students in the School Psychology Ph.D. program to have an area of emphasis, one option being pediatric school psychology. Lehigh University in Pennsylvania has a similar option to complete an endorsement in Pediatric School Psychology as part of their doctoral training, which requires 8 credit hours beyond the regular doctoral requirements. Students at Lehigh University enroll in the Pediatric School Psychology endorsement as a part of the competitive Leadership Training project supported by the U.S. Department of Education.

While the majority of traditional school psychology programs do not offer a subspecialization in pediatric school psychology, this does not necessarily limit students. When a formal subspecialization option is not available, one may request and select field experiences in typical pediatric school psychology settings. Typical settings include hospitals, school-based health clinics, and medical centers. The Pediatric School Psychology Interest Group is an interest group within the National Association of School Psychologists where members can discuss topics related to the subspecialization with experts in the field. The group also holds an annual meeting at the Annual Convention.

=== Behavioral School Psychology ===
Behavioral school psychology uses the same principals as behavioral psychology which dates back to 1913 where it became established by John B. Watson. There are several other thinkers that influenced the field of behavioral psychology. The field really blossomed from the ideas of Ivan Pavlov’s classical conditioning and B.F. Skinner’s operant conditioning. Operant conditioning uses rewards and punishments to increase and decrease behaviors. School psychologists use these ideas to increase positive behaviors and decrease problem behaviors that interfere with a student&#x27;s learning. While the idea of behavioral psychology has its critics, and a lot of them say there are other factors that go into one’s behaviors, one of the strengths is that behaviors are observable, therefore much easier to measure, collect data and recognize a change.

Behavioral psychology in schools has expanded largely during the last 15 years, because of two main reasons. Inclusive schooling has become increasingly prevalent in today’s world, starting with the “Free and Appropriate Public Education” (FAPE) (1997) requiring that students who have developmental disabilities, cognitive impairments, and behavior disorders will be provided with the opportunity to attend their chosen public schools with their peers who do not have disorders or disabilities. Before the implementation of the regular education initiative (REI), a response to identified problems in the system for educating low-performing children. It was common for this population to be enrolled in private programs or other educational settings other than the public schools with outside resources. Because of the increased enrollment of students with these complications, public schools have recognized the benefits of collaborating with behavior consultants to improve academic instruction and reduce discipline problems. This produces many referrals to professionals who provide consultation as psychologists or behavior specialists affiliated with a private practice, clinic, or human services agency.

=== School Based Mental Health ===
Mental health in children is an important factor that influences success in school and life. If mental health problems within children go unresolved, negative outcomes such as academic and behavior problems can arise. Mental health is not only the absence of mental illness, but also includes social, emotional, and behavioral health, along with the ability to cope with life&#x27;s challenges. As the need for mental health services for children and youth grow, schools are becoming an ideal place to provide this form of service.

The benefits of addressing mental health problems in the life of a child are significant in a number of different ways. Quality of life for the child increases, physical health can improve, and they have better chances at attaining a quality education, as well as healthy social skills. It is even more cost efficient to address mental health problems in young people than it is later in life.

<text>USS &quot;Charger&quot; (CVE-30) was an escort carrier of the United States Navy during World War II converted from a commercial C3-P&amp;C cargo/passenger liner hull built as Rio de la Plata intended for the Moore-McCormack company&#x27;s American Republics Line serving the east coast of South America. The ship was requisitioned for conversion to an escort carrier type intended for Royal Navy use and initially commissioned as HMS &quot;Charger&quot; (D27). Days later the transfer was rescinded with the ship returning to U.S. Navy control to become USS &quot;Charger&quot; which operated throughout the war as a training ship on the Chesapeake Bay with two ferry missions to Bermuda and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

After decommissioning in March 1946 the ship was sold in January 1947 to become the Italian Fairsea engaged largely in refugee and immigrant voyages from Europe to Australia. After a disabling engine room fire in January 1969 the ship was sold for scrap in Italy.

==Construction==
The United States Maritime Commission (MC) accepted Sun Shipbuilding&#x27;s bid to build the four C3-P&amp;C cargo/passenger liners on 29 November 1939 at a cost of $2,720,800 each. &quot;Rio de la Plata&quot; was planned as the third of four ships to be built by the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Chester, Pennsylvania for the Moore-McCormack company.

The modified C3 type was intended for Moore-McCormack&#x27;s American Republics Line for serving the east coast of the United States to South America and the first large U.S. passenger ships to be fitted with diesel engines. Two six cylinder Sun Doxford diesels with over 9,000 shaft horsepower drove a single propeller through reduction gears for a design speed of . The ships were designed to carry 196 passengers with all passenger spaces air conditioned, another first for passenger ships. The passenger design was not completed due to requisitioning for war service. The passenger-cargo design was to be a 17,500 ton displacement, vessel, length overall and length between perpendiculars. Cargo capacity, with conditioned air to avoid moisture, was to be (bale measure) with of refrigerated space. Passengers were to be quartered in 76 staterooms, 22 single cabins, 34 double cabins and 20 cabins with private verandahs.

The keel for &quot;Rio de la Plata&quot;, MC hull 61, yard hull 188, was laid 19 January 1940 with launch on 1 March 1941 and delivery on 2 October 1941. The ship was sponsored by Mrs. Felipe A. Espil (Courtney Letts de Espil).

On 20 May 1941, the United States Maritime Commission requisitioned all four unfinished combiliners, for conversion to military use.

==Career==

===United States Navy===
On 1 August 1941 the four ships were delivered to the Navy for conversion before completion as commercial vessels. Conversion for naval duties was by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Newport News, Virginia. Intended for transfer to the Royal Navy under Lend-Lease, the former &quot;Rio de la Plata&quot; was commissioned on 2 October 1941 as HMS &quot;Charger&quot; (D27). However, the transfer was rescinded and the ship returned to United States control on 4 October 1941. The vessel was reclassified AVG-30 on 24 January 1942 and commissioned as USS &quot;Charger&quot; on 3 March 1942, Captain T. L. Sprague USN in command; and reported to the Atlantic Fleet.

&quot;Charger&quot;″s area of operations throughout the war was Chesapeake Bay, and her duty the basic task of training pilots and ships&#x27; crews in carrier operations. Men trained on her decks played an important role in the successful contest for the Atlantic with hostile submarines carried out by the escort carrier groups. Reclassified ACV-30 on 20 August 1942, and CVE-30 on 15 July 1943, &quot;Charger&quot; left Chesapeake Bay for two ferry voyages, one to Bermuda in October 1942, and one to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in September 1945. &quot;Charger&quot; was decommissioned at New York on 15 March 1946.

===Post-war service===

The ship was sold into merchant service on 30 January 1947 to the Vlasov group. After conversion the vessel became the passenger liner Fairsea, nominally for Vlasov&#x27;s Italian managed Sitmar Line. Successive accommodation upgrades secured the vessel&#x27;s long-term employment, mainly as a migrant carrier from Europe to Australia.

Among the immigrants arriving aboard &quot;Fairsea&quot; in 1958 was the Gibb family with future Bee Gees Barry, Maurice and Robin. Also aboard were Kylie Minogue&#x27;s parents and Skyhooks guitarist Red Symons.

&quot;Fairsea&quot; was disabled by an engine-room fire between Tahiti and Panama on 29 January 1969. Primarily due to a lack of spare parts she was sold for scrap in Italy in 1969, the last of the four to cease operation. Her last surviving former sister &quot;Biter&quot; (later the French Navy&#x27;s &quot;Dixmude&quot;), had been returned to the United States and sunk as a target in 1966.

<doc id="466798" wikidata="Q939559" url="?curid=466798" title="Photorealism">
<text>Photorealism is a genre of art that encompasses painting, drawing and other graphic media, in which an artist studies a photograph and then attempts to reproduce the image as realistically as possible in another medium. Although the term can be used broadly to describe artworks in many different media, it is also used to refer to a specific art movement of American painters that began in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==History==

===Origins===
As a full-fledged art movement, Photorealism evolved from Pop Art and as a counter to Abstract Expressionism as well as Minimalist art movements in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States. Photorealists use a photograph or several photographs to gather the information to create their paintings and it can be argued that the use of a camera and photographs is an acceptance of Modernism. However, the admittance to the use of photographs in Photorealism was met with intense criticism when the movement began to gain momentum in the late 1960s, despite the fact that visual devices had been used since the fifteenth century to aid artists with their work.

Louis K. Meisel states in his books and lectures the following: The invention of photography in the nineteenth century had three effects on art: portrait and scenic artists were deemed inferior to the photograph and many turned to photography as careers; within nineteenth- and twentieth-century art movements it is well documented that artists used the photograph as source material and as an aid—however, they went to great lengths to deny the fact fearing that their work would be misunderstood as imitations; and through the photograph&#x27;s invention artists were open to a great deal of new experimentation. Thus, the culmination of the invention of the photograph was a break in art&#x27;s history towards the challenge facing the artist—since the earliest known cave drawings—trying to replicate the scenes they viewed.

By the time the Photorealists began producing their bodies of work the photograph had become the leading means of reproducing reality and abstraction was the focus of the art world. Realism continued as an ongoing art movement, even experiencing a reemergence in the 1930s, but by the 1950s modernist critics and Abstract Expressionism had minimalized realism as a serious art undertaking. Though Photorealists share some aspects of American realists, such as Edward Hopper, they tried to set themselves as much apart from traditional realists as they did Abstract Expressionists. Photorealists were much more influenced by the work of Pop artists and were reacting against Abstract Expressionism.

Pop Art and photorealism were both reactionary movements stemming from the ever-increasing and overwhelming abundance of photographic media, which by the mid 20th century had grown into such a massive phenomenon that it was threatening to lessen the value of imagery in art. However, whereas the Pop artists were primarily pointing out the absurdity of much of the imagery (especially in commercial usage), the Photorealists were trying to reclaim and exalt the value of an image.

The association of photorealism with &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; is a wrongly attributed comparison, an error in observation or interpretation made by many critics of the 1970s and 1980s. &quot;Trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; paintings attempt to &quot;fool the eye&quot; and make the viewer think he is seeing an actual object, not a painted one. When observing a Photorealist painting, the viewer is always aware that they are looking at a painting.

===Definition===
The word &quot;Photorealism&quot; was coined by Louis K. Meisel in 1969 and appeared in print for the first time in 1970 in a Whitney Museum catalogue for the show &quot;Twenty-two Realists&quot;. It is also sometimes labeled as Super-Realism, New Realism, Sharp Focus Realism, or Hyper-Realism.

Louis K. Meisel, two years later, developed a five-point definition at the request of Stuart M. Speiser, who had commissioned a large collection of works by the Photorealists, which later developed into a traveling show known as &#x27;Photo-Realism 1973: The Stuart M. Speiser Collection&#x27;, which was donated to the Smithsonian in 1978 and is shown in several of its museums as well as traveling under the auspices of &#x27;site&#x27;. The definition for the &#x27;originators&#x27; was as follows:

# The Photo-Realist uses the camera and photograph to gather information.
# The Photo-Realist uses a mechanical or semi-mechanical means to transfer the information to the canvas.
# The Photo-Realist must have the technical ability to make the finished work appear photographic.
# The artist must have exhibited work as a Photo-Realist by 1972 to be considered one of the central Photo-Realists.
# The artist must have devoted at least five years to the development and exhibition of Photo-Realist work.
===Styles===
Photorealist painting cannot exist without the photograph. In Photorealism, change and movement must be frozen in time which must then be accurately represented by the artist. Photorealists gather their imagery and information with the camera and photograph. Once the photograph is developed (usually onto a photographic slide) the artist will systematically transfer the image from the photographic slide onto canvases. Usually this is done either by projecting the slide onto the canvas or by using traditional grid techniques. The resulting images are often direct copies of the original photograph but are usually larger than the original photograph or slide. This results in the photorealist style being tight and precise, often with an emphasis on imagery that requires a high level of technical prowess and virtuosity to simulate, such as reflections in specular surfaces and the geometric rigor of man-made environs.

===Artists===
The first generation of American Photorealists includes the painters Richard Estes, Ralph Goings, Chuck Close, Charles Bell, Audrey Flack, Don Eddy, Denis Peterson, Robert Bechtle, Ron Kleemann, Richard McLean, John Salt, , and Tom Blackwell. Often working independently of each other and with widely different starting points, these original Photorealists routinely tackled mundane or familiar subjects in traditional art genres--landscapes (mostly urban rather than naturalistic), portraits, and still lifes.

With the birth of the Photorealist movement, many painters who were related to Photorealism, continued to pursue and refine their techniques; they became the second generation of Photorealists. These painters included John Baeder, Hilo Chen, Jack Mendenhall, Ken Marschall, David Parrish and Idelle Weber.

In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, photorealist approaches were favoured by many artists including Mike Gorman and Eric Scott. The introduction of these European painters to a wider US audience was brought about through the 1982 &#x27;Superhumanism&#x27; exhibition at the Arnold Katzen Gallery, New York.

Though the movement is primarily associated with painting, Duane Hanson and John DeAndrea are sculptors associated with photorealism for their painted, lifelike sculptures of average people that were complete with simulated hair and real clothes. They are called &quot;Verists.&quot;

===Since 2000===

Though the height of Photorealism was in the 1970s, the movement continues and includes several of the original photorealists as well as many of their contemporaries. According to Meisel and Chase&#x27;s &quot;Photorealism at the Millennium&quot;, only eight of the original thirteen photorealists were still creating Photorealist work in 2002. As of September 2020, Richard Estes is the only remaining original Photorealist actively working in the Photorealist style.

Artists Robert Bechtle, Charles Bell, Tom Blackwell, Ralph Goings, John Kacere, Ron Kleemann have died; Audrey Flack, Chuck Close, Don Eddy, and have moved away from Photorealism; and Robert Cottingham no longer considers himself a photorealist.

Newer Photorealists are building upon the foundations set by the original Photorealists. Examples would be the influence of Richard Estes in works by Anthony Brunelli or the influence of Ralph Goings and Charles Bell in works by Glennray Tutor. However, this has led many to move on from the strict definition of photorealism as the emulation of the photograph. Photorealism is also no longer simply an American art movement. Starting with Franz Gertsch in the 1980s Clive Head, Raphaella Spence, Bertrand Meniel, and Roberto Bernardi are several European artists associated with photorealism that have emerged since the mid-1990s. This internationalization of photorealism is also seen in photorealist events, such as The Prague Project, in which American and non-American photorealist painters have traveled together to locations including Prague, Zurich, Monaco and New York, to work alongside each other in producing work.

The evolution of technology has brought forth photorealistic paintings that exceed what was thought possible with paintings; these newer paintings by the photorealists are sometimes referred to as &quot;Hyperrealism&quot;. With new technology in cameras and digital equipment, artists are able to be far more precision-oriented and can produce imagery using a wider range of media. The artist Bill Fink has developed his own technique for creating photorealistic images using soil, pollen, human hair, and cremated human remains.

Photorealism&#x27;s influence and popularity continues to grow, with new books such as Juxtapoz&#x27;s 2014 book entitled &quot;Hyperreal&quot; detailing current trends within the artistic genre.

<text>Aquaponics is a food production system that couples aquaculture (raising aquatic animals such as fish, crayfish, snails or prawns in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) whereby the nutrient-rich aquaculture water is fed to hydroponically grown plants.

Plants are grown in hydroponics systems, with their roots immersed in the nutrient-rich effluent water. This enables them to filter out the ammonia that is toxic to the aquatic animals, or its metabolites. After the water has passed through the hydroponic subsystem, it is cleaned and oxygenated, and can return to the aquaculture vessels.

The size, complexity, and types of foods grown in an aquaponic system can vary as much as any system found in either distinct farming discipline. The main fish grown in aquaponics are tilapia, koi, goldfish, carp, catfish, barramundi, and different types of ornamental fish. The main plants produced include lettuce, pak choi, kale, basil, mint, watercress, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, beans, peas, squash, broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage.

Fish, plants and microbes are three main components of aquaponics, and microbes play the bridge role of converting fish waste to plant nutrients. The three major types of modern aquaponic designs are deep-water or &quot;raft&quot;, nutrient film technology, and media-based bed or reciprocating systems.

== System types ==
Generally, aquaponics systems are classified into three types, namely media-based bed, floating raft, and nutrient film technique. Among them, the media-based system is believed to be more efficient in the utilization of nitrogen since it provides more volume-to-surface area ratio for the microbes than the other two types.

=== Deep water culture ===
The deep water culture system consists of substantial troughs containing perforated floating rafts, into which net plant pots are placed. Within the system, these plant pots are typically filled with media, such as rockwool, coco, or pumice, that serve to support the roots, which are subsequently and continuously submerged within the water tank.

=== Nutrient film technique ===
The nutrient film technique consists of narrow channels of perforated squared pipes where the roots are partially immersed in a thin layer of streaming water.

=== Media-based grow bed ===
A media-based grow bed is a hydroponic system type that utilizes a trough filled with an inert material to assist plant roots and accommodate beneficial microbes. Water is usually delivered in a flooding and draining cycle (ebb and flow), delivering nutrients and oxygen to the plants. 

By utilizing gravel or sand as plant supporting medium, solids are captured and the medium has enough surface area for fixed-film nitrification. The ability to combine biofiltration and hydroponics allows for aquaponic system, in many cases, to eliminate the need for an expensive, separate biofilter.

A media‐based system is believed to be more efficient in the utilization of nitrogen since it provides more volume‐to‐surface area ratio for the microbes than deep-water raft or nutrient film technique.

== History ==
Aquaponics has ancient roots, although there is some debate on its first occurrence. 

=== Early beginnings: Aztecs and Chinese (6th century - 13th century) ===
Aquaponics has been said to have evolved from relatively ancient agriculture practices associated with integrating fish culture with plant production, especially those developed within the South East Asian, flooded rice paddy farming context and South American Chinampa, floating island, agriculture practices (Komives and Junge 2015). In reality, historically, fish were rarely actively added to rice paddy fields until the nineteenth century (Halwart and Gupta 2004) and were present in very low densities which would not contribute to any substantial nutritive assistance to the plants. Chinampas were traditionally built on lakes in Mexico where nutrient advantages may have been supplied via the eutrophic or semi-eutrophic lake sediments rather than directly from any designed or actively integrated fish production system (Morehart 2016; Baquedano 1993).
*The Aztec cultivated agricultural islands known as &quot;chinampas&quot; in a system considered by some to be an early form of aquaponics for agricultural use, where plants were raised on stationary (or sometime movable) islands in lake shallows and waste materials dredged from the Chinampa canals and surrounding cities were used to manually irrigate the plants.
*South China and the whole of Southeast Asia, where rice was cultivated and farmed in paddy fields in combination with fish, are cited as examples of early aquaponics systems, although the technology had been brought by Chinese settlers who had migrated from Yunnan around 5 AD. These polycultural farming systems existed in many Far Eastern countries and raised fish such as the oriental loach (泥鳅, ドジョウ), swamp eel (黄鳝, 田鰻), common carp (鯉魚, コイ) and crucian carp (鯽魚) as well as pond snails (田螺) in the paddies.
*The 13th-century Chinese agricultural manual &quot;Wang Zhen&#x27;s Book on Farming&quot; (王禎農書) described floating wooden rafts which were piled with mud and dirt and which were used for growing rice, wild rice, and fodder. Such floating planters were employed in regions constituting the modern provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian. These floating planters are known as either (架田) or (葑田), which translates to &quot;framed paddy&quot; and &quot;brassica paddy&quot;, respectively. The agricultural work also references earlier Chinese texts, which indicated that floating raft rice cultivation was being used as early as the Tang dynasty (6th century) and Northern Song dynasty (8th century) periods of Chinese history.

=== Modern developments (1930s-present) ===
An integrated system of aquaculture and agriculture where fish are grown in rice paddies has been employed in the North Kerian area of Perak in Peninsular Malaysia since the 1930&#x27;s. Several rice-fish systems are also reported to have a long history in Indonesia.

In 1965, Sengbusch and his colleagues were the first to attempt raising common carp, a type of fish, in tanks with a system that recirculated water and used activated sludge to treat the water. A few years later, in 1971, Scherb and Braun provided more detailed studies on using a similar system to raise rainbow trout. At the South Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station in Clemson, researchers Loyacano and Grosvenor (1973) tried to clean fish ponds with channel catfish by using water chestnut plants to absorb the extra nutrients.
In 1977, German scientist Ludwig C.A. Naegel contributed to the field of aquaponics with his publication &#x27;Combined Production of Fish and Plants in Recirculating Water.&#x27; The work presented experiments on the co-cultivation of tilapia and tomatoes, showcasing the practicality of a recirculating system that supports both fish and plant production. This research is among the efforts by a global community of researchers to develop modern aquaponics systems.

Balarin and Haller conducted studies on the thermal dynamics of aquaponic systems, examining the effects of varying water temperatures on the growth rates of fish and plants.

In the development of biofiltration techniques within aquaponics, Muir, Paller, and Lewis introduced reciprocating biofilters (RBFs). These biofilters enhanced the efficiency of nutrient uptake by plants and reduced the accumulation of harmful metabolites in the water.

Watten and Busch contributed to the understanding of nutrient dynamics in aquaponic systems. Their studies on the integration of vascular plants into recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) demonstrated how plants could effectively extract excess nutrients from the water. 

Prior to the technological advances of the 1980s, most attempts to integrate hydroponics and aquaculture had limited success. Many of the modern developments and discoveries of aquaponics are generally attributed to the New Alchemy Institute and North Carolina State University.

=== New Alchemy Institute ===
In 1969, John and Nancy Todd and William McLarney founded the New Alchemy Institute and built a prototype replica of the Aztec&#x27;s aquaponic system (with some modifications) to provide shelter, vegetables, and fish throughout the year. In 1984, Ronald Zweig of the New Alchemy Institute developed a system he called the &#x27;hydroponic aquaculture pond,&#x27; also referred to as a &#x27;hydroponic solar pond.&#x27; This system integrated a floating hydroponic component within the institute&#x27;s existing solar pond these floating raft systems are the foundation for what became later known as deep water culture. 

=== North Carolina State University ===
Mark McMurtry and others at North Carolina State University conceptualized the Integrated Aqua-Vegeculture System. This system, which integrates aquaculture with sand-based grow beds, represents one of the earliest instances of a closed-loop aquaponic system. McMurtry&#x27;s research and findings confirmed much of the foundational science underlying aquaponics, demonstrating that the system operates effectively.
=== University of the Virgin Islands ===
In 1979, James Rakocy and his colleagues at the University of the Virgin Islands began experimenting with media beds in aquaponics. Initially, the system utilized a gravel bed for plant growth, alongside a conical filter settling tank to collect larger solid waste, and a separate tank for housing the fish. In 1986, they started to test the use of floating rafts constructed from polystyrene. By 1997, Rakocy&#x27;s research had led to the adoption of deep water culture hydroponic grow beds in large-scale aquaponic systems.

=== Other systems ===
Other institutes focused their research on systems known as &quot;ebb and flow,&quot; or &quot;flood and drain&quot; systems. These systems utilize coarse media like gravel or expanded clay, with bell siphons facilitating the irrigation cycle These systems are sometimes referred to as &quot;Speraneo Systems,&quot; as they were named after Tom and Paula Speraneo, who created and sold an instructional manual in the 1990s and adopted the North Carolina State University system to invent a full-size commercial-scale solar greenhouse.

The first aquaponics research in Canada began with a small system integrated into aquaculture research at a station in Lethbridge, Alberta. In the 1990s, commercial aquaponics setups increased, focusing on high-value crops like trout and lettuce. A key development occurred in Brooks, Alberta, where Dr. Nick Savidov and his team from Lethbridge College&#x27;s Aquaculture Centre of Excellence (ACE) conducted extensive research. They found rapid root growth in aquaponics systems and effective methods for closing the solid-waste loop. They also discovered that these systems could efficiently operate at low pH levels, which benefits plant growth but is typically unfavorable for fish. This research led to the creation of the first fully automated zero-waste aquaponics system, enhancing sustainability and efficiency in aquaponics operations. 

Floating aquaponics systems on polycultural fish ponds were installed in China in 2009. They are used to grow rice, wheat and canna lily and other crops, with some installations exceeding .

=== Terminology ===
The term &quot;aquaponics&quot; combines &quot;aquaculture&quot; (the farming of aquatic organisms) and &quot;hydroponics&quot; (the soilless cultivation of plants).

In the 1970s and 1980s, aquaponics was described by various terms such as &quot;combined fish and vegetable production in greenhouses&quot; or &quot;combined production of fish and plants in recirculating water.&quot; The term &quot;aquaponics&quot; became more widely used after the Aquaponics Journal began publication in 1997, although other terms like &quot;integrated fish/vegetable co-culture system&quot; were also used.

Definitions of &quot;aquaponics&quot; vary. Some experts limit it to plant cultivation using hydroponics, while others have a broader interpretation. The suffix &quot;ponics&quot; in hydroponics and aquaponics comes from the Greek word &quot;ponos,&quot; meaning &quot;work.&quot; Therefore, &quot;aquaponics&quot; can be translated to &quot;water work,&quot; though this may not fully describe the system&#x27;s function and purpose.

Clear definitions are important in discussions about eco-certification. Currently, aquaponics is not included in the European Union&#x27;s organic agriculture certification scheme because it uses hydroponics. However, other forms of aquaponics that involve soil-based organic food production could potentially be certified as organic. 

== Parts of an aquaponic system ==
Aquaponics consists of two main parts, with the aquaculture part for raising aquatic animals and the hydroponics part for growing plants. Although consisting primarily of these two parts, aquaponics systems are usually grouped into several components or subsystems depending on the type of system. Depending on the sophistication and cost of the aquaponics system, the units for solids removal, biofiltration, and/or the hydroponics subsystem may be combined into one unit or subsystem.

=== Rearing tank ===
The tanks for raising and feeding the fish.

=== Hydroponic subsystem ===
The portion of the system where plants are grown by absorbing excess nutrients from the water.

=== Water pump ===
Used to circulate water. 

=== Settling basin (optional) ===
A unit, also known as a clarifier, for catching uneaten food and detached biofilms, and for settling out fine particulates.

=== Biofilter (optional) ===
A place where the nitrification bacteria can grow and convert ammonia into nitrates, which are usable by the plants; A biofilter is optional.

=== Sump (optional) ===
Certain systems use a sump. The sump is equipped with a pump or pump inlet that circulates the treated culture water back to the rearing tanks.

== Live components ==
Aquaponic systems rely on a symbiotic relationship between three main live components: plants, fish (or other aquatic animals), and bacteria. Some systems also include additional live components like worms.

=== Plants ===
* Plants are the primary producers in an aquaponic system, converting sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients into biomass.
* A wide variety of plants can be grown in aquaponic systems, including leafy green vegetables, herbs, fruits, and vegetables.
* Plants help to purify the water by removing excess nutrients and waste products.
Since plants at different growth stages require different amounts of minerals and nutrients, plant harvesting is staggered with seedlings growing at the same time as mature plants. This ensures stable nutrient content in the water because of continuous symbiotic cleansing of toxins from the water.
=== Fish (or other aquatic creatures) ===


* Fish and other aquatic animals are the primary consumers in an aquaponic system, providing a source of protein and nutrients for the plants.
* A variety of fish species can be used in aquaponic systems, including tilapia, goldfish, and koi.
* Fish help to fertilize the plants by producing &#x27;waste&#x27; that is rich in nutrients

=== Bacteria ===
* Bacteria play a crucial role in aquaponic systems, converting ammonia from fish waste into nitrate, a nutrient that can be used by plants.
* Beneficial bacteria, such as Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter, are essential for maintaining a healthy and balanced ecosystem.
* Bacteria help to purify the water by removing excess ammonia and other waste products.

=== Algae ===
While often regarded as a nuisance in traditional aquaculture, algae can be a beneficial component in certain aquaponic designs. In systems such as Integrated Aqua-Vegeculture System, algae are intentionally cultivated in the surface layer of the biofilter. In these systems, algae act as a nutrient sink, absorbing excess nutrients, which helps maintain optimal water quality and reduces the risk of nutrient imbalances. However, not all aquaponic systems utilize algae in this way; in other types of systems, algae in the fish tank are considered a nuisance that needs to be controlled.

Algae can release substances that can be harmful to fish, other microorganisms, and plants. For example, blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, can produce toxins that directly threaten the health of fish, and their physical presence can damage the gills of fish.

== Biofilter ==
Aquatic effluents, resulting from uneaten feed or raising animals like fish, accumulate in water due to the closed-system recirculation of most aquaculture systems. The effluent-rich water becomes toxic to the aquatic animal in high concentrations but this contains nutrients essential for plant growth. 

Typically, after a system has stabilized ammonia levels range from 0.25 to .50 ppm; nitrite levels range from 0.0 to 0.25 ppm, and nitrate levels range from 5 to 150 ppm. During system startup, systems take several weeks to begin the nitrification process. As a result, spikes may occur in the levels of ammonia (up to 6.0 ppm) and nitrite (up to 15 ppm) as the nitrosomonas and nitrobacter bacteria have yet to establish populations within the system. Nitrate levels peak later in the startup phase as the system completes nitrogen cycles and maintains a healthy biofilter and these bacteria grow into a mature colony. with nitrate levels peaking later in the startup phase. In the nitrification process ammonia is oxidized into nitrite, which releases hydrogen ions into the water. Over time, the water&#x27;s pH will slowly drop, non-sodium bases such as potassium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide can be used to neutralize the water&#x27;s pH if insufficient quantities are naturally present in the water to provide a buffer against acidification. In addition, selected minerals or nutrients such as iron can be added in addition to the fish waste that serves as the main source of nutrients to plants.

== Operation ==
The five main inputs to the system are water, oxygen, light, feed given to the aquatic animals, and electricity to pump, filter, and oxygenate the water. Spawn or fry may be added to replace grown fish that are taken out from the system to retain a stable system. In terms of outputs, an aquaponics system may continually yield plants such as vegetables grown in hydroponics, and edible aquatic species raised in an aquaculture. Typical build ratios are .5 to 1 square foot of grow space for every of aquaculture water in the system. of water can support between and of fish stock depending on aeration and filtration.

===Feed source===
As in most aquaculture based systems, stock feed often consists of fish meal derived from lower-value species. Ongoing depletion of wild fish stocks makes this practice unsustainable. Organic fish feeds may prove to be a viable alternative that relieves this concern. Other alternatives include growing duckweed with an aquaponics system that feeds the same fish grown on the system, excess worms grown from vermiculture composting, using prepared kitchen scraps, as well as growing black soldier fly larvae to feed to the fish using composting grub growers.

===Plant nutrients===
Healthy plant growth relies on diverse organic compounds in the root environment, produced by microbial decomposition. These include vitamins, hormones, and enzymes, essential for growth, yield, flavor, and pathogen resistance. Organic matter like humic acid helps make micronutrients available. While inorganic nutrients are vital, plants need organic metabolites for optimal development.

===Water usage===
Aquaponic systems are designed to recirculate and reuse water efficiently, rather than discharging or exchanging it under normal operation. This system relies on the interaction between animals and plants to maintain a stable aquatic environment with minimal fluctuations in nutrient and oxygen levels. Plants absorb dissolved nutrients from the circulating water, which reduces the need for water discharge and minimizes the water exchange rate. Some authors have reported 90% less water usage through aquaponics compared to conventional commercial fish and crop production systems.

Water is added to the system only to replace losses due to plant absorption and transpiration, evaporation, overflow from rainfall, and removal of solid wastes. Consequently, aquaponics uses about 2% of the water required by conventional irrigation methods for the same vegetable production. This efficiency allows for the cultivation of crops and fish in areas with limited water or fertile land.

Aquaponic systems can also mimic controlled wetland conditions, making them useful for biofiltration and treating household sewage. The nutrient-rich overflow water can be collected in catchment tanks and reused to boost the growth of soil-planted crops or pumped back into the aquaponic system to maintain water levels.

In traditional aquaculture, regular water exchange is essential, unlike in aquaponics. Producing 1 kg of beef typically demands 5,000 to 20,000 liters of water. Semi-intensive and extensive conventional aquaculture requires 2,500 to 375,000 liters for the same amount of fish. In contrast, recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are highly efficient, recycling 95% to 99% of water and using under 100 liters per kilogram of fish.

=== Fish stocking ===
In order for aquaponic systems to be financially successful and make a profit whilst also covering its operating expenses, the hydroponic plant components and fish rearing components need to almost constantly be at maximum production capacity. To keep the bio-mass of fish in the system at its maximum (without limiting fish growth), there are three main stocking method that can help maintain this maximum.
* &quot;Sequential rearing:&quot; Multiple age groups of fish share a rearing tank, and when an age group reaches market size they are selectively harvested and replaced with the same amount of fingerlings. Downsides to this method include stressing out the entire pool of fish during each harvest, missing fish resulting in a waste of food/space, and the difficulty of keeping accurate records with frequent harvests.
* &quot;Stock splitting:&quot; Large quantities of fingerlings are stocked at once and then split into two groups once the tank hits maximum capacity, which is easier to record and eliminates fish being &quot;forgotten&quot;. A stress-free way of doing this operation is via &quot;swimways&quot; that connect various rearing tanks and a series of hatches/moving screens/pumps that move the fish around.
* &quot;Multiple rearing units:&quot; Such systems usually have 2–4 tanks that share a filtration system, and when the largest tank is harvested, the other fish groups are moved up into a bigger tank whilst a new batch is started in the smallest tank. It is also common for there to be several rearing tanks yet no ways to move fish between them, which eliminates the labor of moving fish and allows each tank to be undisturbed during harvesting, even if the space usage is inefficient when the fish are fingerlings.
Ideally the bio-mass of fish in the rearing tanks doesn&#x27;t exceed 0.5 lbs/gallon, in order to reduce stress from crowding, efficiently feed the fish, and promote healthy growth.

=== Disease and pest management ===
The most effective organic pesticide is Neem oil, but only in small quantities to minimize spill over fish&#x27;s water.. Commercialization of aquaponics is often stalled by bottlenecks in pest and disease management. The use of chemical control methods is highly complicated for all systems. While insecticides and herbicides are replaceable by well‐established commercial biocontrol measures, fungicides and nematicides are still relevant in aquaponics. Monitoring and cultural control are the first approaches to contain pest population. Biological controls, in general, are adaptable to a larger extent. Non‐chemical prophylactic measures are highly proficient for pest and disease prevention in all designs.

Plants grown in aquaponic systems might have higher resistance to diseases compared to those grown in traditional hydroponic systems. This environment supports a diverse range of microorganisms, some of which may help protect plant roots from pathogens.

=== Automation, monitoring, and control ===
Today&#x27;s technology has greatly improved aquaponic systems. With the use of advanced sensors and IoT devices, these systems can now run with a lot of automation. This makes it possible to closely manage important factors like nutrient levels, water usage, and lighting. Automating these processes not only makes aquaponics more efficient but can also lead to better crop yields and smarter use of resources..

Many have tried to create automatic control and monitoring systems and some of these demonstrated a level of success. For instance, researchers were able to introduce automation in a small scale aquaponic system to achieve a cost-effective and sustainable farming system. Commercial development of automation technologies has also emerged. For instance, a company has developed a system capable of automating the repetitive tasks of farming and features a machine learning algorithm that can automatically detect and eliminate diseased or underdeveloped plants. A 3.75-acre aquaponics facility that claims to be the first indoor salmon farm in the United States also includes an automated technology. The aquaponic machine has made notable strides in the documenting and gathering of information regarding aquaponics.

=== Economic viability ===
Aquaponics offers a diverse and stable polyculture system that allows farmers to grow vegetables and raise fish at the same time. By having two sources of profit, farmers can continue to earn money even if the market for either fish or plants goes through a low cycle. The flexibility of an aquaponic system allows it to grow a large variety of crops including ordinary vegetables, herbs, flowers and aquatic plants to cater to a broad spectrum of consumers. Some profitable plants for aquaponic systems include chinese cabbage, lettuce, basil, roses, tomatoes, okra, cantaloupe and bell peppers.

For environmentally conscious consumers, aquaponic products are appealing because they are organic and pesticide-free, and the systems have a relatively small environmental footprint. Aquaponic systems are also economically efficient due to their low water usage, effective nutrient cycling, and minimal land requirements. These systems can be established in areas with poor soil quality or contaminated water and require only a small amount of water. Additionally, aquaponic systems are typically free from weeds, pests, and soil-borne diseases, which allows for the consistent and rapid production of high-quality crops.

Research concerning aquaponics has focused mainly on technical facets, with a limited number of studies addressing its economic viability, particularly in commercial contexts. While aquaponics is generally deemed profitable and sustainable, the calculation of costs and the comparison of systems are rendered complex due to diverse site conditions, climatic variations, and fluctuating market prices. Energy expenses constitute a significant factor and exhibit considerable variation across countries, thereby complicating assessments of profitability. Some researchers propose that aquaponics achieves financial equilibrium after a span of two years, whereas others contend that profitability should be gauged on a per square meter basis.

The existing body of research pertaining to aquaponic systems and their economic sustainability remains considerably less extensive when compared with that of conventional hydroponic systems. Based on the research currently available, the economic viability of aquaponic enterprises must be evaluated on an individual basis. Numerous variables—including system design, seasonal climatic conditions, and local energy or land costs—play a pivotal role in determining the profitability of aquaponic ventures.

Additional research shows the support that aquaponic systems can use 14% less fertilizer than hydroponic systems. Despite this reduction, a grower should determine if the cost of maintaining aquaculture is cheaper than the use of extra fertilizer in hydroponics.

Other non-system-based barriers to the economic success of aquaponic systems could include that these systems require a high degree of knowledge in multiple disciplines, a lack of financing opportunities for aquaponics, and the fact that the general public doesn&#x27;t understand what aquaponics is. An aquaponics business may require additional branding strategies compared to hydroponics, which is a technology that is relatively well known at this point in the United States.

One of the limitations of aquaponics development is the lack of commercially viable financial feasibility, considering that private companies do not share their studies with the public. 

== Current examples ==
=== Europe ===
*In March 2018, the European Aquaponics Association was established among European countries. This opened up an organization for European countries to continue aquaponic research and the implementation of aquaponic practices.
=== Asia ===
*In Bangladesh, the world&#x27;s most densely populated country, most farmers use agrochemicals to enhance food production and storage life, though the country lacks oversight on safe levels of chemicals in foods for human consumption. To combat this issue, a team led by M.A. Salam at the Department of Aquaculture of Bangladesh Agricultural University has created plans for a low-cost aquaponics system to provide organic produce and fish for people living in adverse climatic conditions such as the salinity-prone southern area and the flood-prone haor area in the eastern region. Salam&#x27;s work innovates a form of subsistence farming for micro-production goals at the community and personal levels.
*An aquaponic gardening system is developed for use on rooftops in Gaza City.
===North America===
*Dakota College at Bottineau in Bottineau, North Dakota has an aquaponics program that gives students the ability to obtain a certificate or an AAS degree in aquaponics.
*The Smith Road facility in Denver started an aquaponics program to feed 800 to 1,000 inmates at the Denver Jail, and a neighboring downtown facility which consists of 1,500 inmates and 700 officers.
*Volunteer operation in Nicaragua &quot;Amigos for Christ&quot; manages its plantation for feeding 900+ poverty-stricken school children by using nutrients from aquaponic methods.
*There has been a shift towards community integration of aquaponics, such as the nonprofit foundation Growing Power that offers Milwaukee youth job opportunities and training while growing food for their community. The model has spawned several satellite projects in other cities, such as New Orleans where the Vietnamese fisherman community has suffered from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and in the South Bronx in New York City.
*Whispering Roots is a non-profit organization in Omaha, Nebraska that provides fresh, locally grown, healthy food for socially and economically disadvantaged communities by using aquaponics, hydroponics and urban farming.
*Recently, aquaponics has been moving towards indoor production systems. In cities like Chicago, entrepreneurs are utilizing vertical designs to grow food year round. These systems can be used to grow food year round with minimal to no waste.
===Caribbean===
*The Caribbean island of Barbados created an initiative to start aquaponics systems at home, called the aquaponic machine, with revenue generated by selling produce to tourists in an effort to reduce growing dependence on imported food.
Aquaponic gardeners from all around the world are gathering in online community sites and forums to share their experiences and promote the development of this form of gardening, as well as creating extensive resources on how to build home systems.

There are various modular systems made for the public that utilize aquaponic systems to produce organic vegetables and herbs, and provide indoor decor at the same time. These systems can serve as a source of herbs and vegetables indoors. Universities are promoting research on these modular systems as they get more popular among city dwellers.

<text>USS &quot;Prince William&quot; (CVE-31) (originally AVG-31, later ACV-31), ex-MC Hull 242, was laid down by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation of Tacoma, Washington, 18 May 1942 as AVG-31; redesignated ACV-31 on 20 August 1942; launched 23 August 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Paul Foley; and commissioned 9 April 1943, Captain Herbert E. Regan in command. The ship was named after Prince William Sound, Alaska.

==Service history==
Following an abbreviated shakedown off the west coast, &quot;Prince William&quot; reported for duty with the Pacific Fleet’s air arm to ferry planes and transport personnel to forward areas. Redesignated CVE-31 on 15 July 1943, she operated between the west coast and such places as New Caledonia, Canton Island, Samoa and Espiritu Santo until the spring of 1944.

Then, a brief assignment at San Diego, training and qualifying pilots, preceded her return to ferrying duties in mid-April 1944. She completed a run to Townsville, Australia, 7 May 1944, and, on her return to San Diego, was reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet. Unloading aircraft and cargo at Port Everglades, Florida, 21 June 1944, she continued on to Norfolk where new navigational equipment (LORAN) was installed. During July and into August, she qualified pilots in the Chesapeake Bay area, then, on 24 August 1944, resumed plane and personnel ferry services with a run to Casablanca. Returning with worn airplane engines and parts, she moored at Norfolk 26 September 1944 for availability. &quot;Prince William&quot; returned to training duties in mid-October 1944.

Until 26 January 1945, she qualified pilots in the Narrangansett Bay area, then shifted to Key West. There she continued to carry out her mission as a training carrier until returning to Norfolk in May. On 2 June 1945, the CVE got underway for the Panama Canal and on the 8th rejoined the Pacific Fleet. Again assigned to ferrying duties, she transported planes and personnel between the west coast and Hawaii for the remainder of World War II.

After the cessation of hostilities, &quot;Prince William&quot; was assigned to “Magic Carpet” duty and for the next seven months returned military personnel and equipment to the United States. Completing her last run at San Diego, 21 March 1946, she was ordered to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and on 8 April 1946 got underway for the Panama Canal. Arriving at Norfolk on 23 April 1946, she continued on, two days later, to Philadelphia where she decommissioned 29 August 1946.

Reclassified CVHE-31, 12 June 1955, &quot;Prince William&quot; remained a unit of the Philadelphia Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet until struck from the Naval Register 1 March 1959. She was sold for scrap in Japan in March 1961.

<text>METAR is a format for reporting weather information. A METAR weather report is predominantly used by aircraft pilots, and by meteorologists, who use aggregated METAR information to assist in weather forecasting.

Raw METAR is the most common format in the world for the transmission of observational weather data. It is highly standardized through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which enables it to be understood throughout most of the world.

==Report names==
In its publication the &quot;Aeronautical Information Manual&quot; (&quot;AIM&quot;), the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) describes the report as &quot;aviation routine weather report&quot;, while the international authority for the code form, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), describes it as the &quot;aerodrome routine meteorological report.&quot; The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (part of the United States Department of Commerce) and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Met Office both employ the definition used by the FAA. METAR is also known as &quot;Meteorological Terminal Aviation Routine Weather Report&quot; or &quot;Meteorological Aerodrome Report&quot;.

== Frequencies and types ==

METARs typically come from airports or other permanent weather observation stations. Reports are generated once an hour or half-hour at most stations, but if conditions change significantly at a staffed location, a report known as a special (SPECI) may be issued. Some stations make regular reports more frequently, such as Pierce County Airport (ICAO code: KPLU) which issues reports three times per hour. In addition to METARs and SPECIs, ASOS One-Minute Observations (OMO) are updated once a minute. OMOs can be in various formats, including the METAR format.

Some METARs are encoded by automated airport weather stations located at airports, military bases, and other sites. Some locations still use augmented observations, which are recorded by digital sensors, encoded via software, and then reviewed by certified weather observers or forecasters prior to being transmitted. Observations may also be taken by trained observers or forecasters who manually observe and encode their observations prior to transmission. In the United States, prior to mid-1990s, most observations are made manually, but today the vast majority are automated or augmented observations.

==History==
The METAR format was introduced internationally on 1 January 1968, and has been modified a number of times since. North American countries continued to use a Surface Aviation Observation (SAO) for current weather conditions until 1 June 1996, when this report was replaced with an approved variant of the METAR agreed upon in a 1989 Geneva agreement. The WMO&#x27;s publication No. 782 &quot;Aerodrome Reports and Forecasts&quot; contains the base METAR code as adopted by the WMO member countries.

==Information contained in a METAR==
A typical METAR contains data for the airport identifier, time of observation, wind direction and speed, visibility, current weather phenomena such as precipitation, cloud cover and heights, temperature, dew point, and barometric pressure. This information forms the body of the report, consisting a maximum of 11 groups of information. A METAR may also contain information on precipitation amounts, lightning, and other information that would be of interest to pilots or meteorologists such as a pilot report or PIREP, colour states and runway visual range (RVR). These may be provided in coded or plain language and appended to the end of the METAR as remarks.

In addition, a short period forecast called a &quot;TREND&quot; may be added at the end of the METAR covering likely changes in weather conditions in the two hours following the observation. These are in the same format as a Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF).

The complement to METARs, reporting forecast weather rather than current weather, are TAFs. METARs and TAFs are used in VOLMET broadcasts.

=== Cloud reporting ===
Cloud coverage is reported by the number of &quot;oktas&quot; (eighths) of the sky that is occupied by cloud. Automated substation substitutes time averaging of sensor data gathered during 30-minute period prior to reporting.

This is reported as:

The following codes identify the cloud types used in the 8/nnn part of RMK.

=== Wind reporting ===
Wind observation measures the horizontal vector component of the wind, which includes both direction and speed. These are determined by evaluating the measurement over a 2-minute period.

The wind direction is coded with the first three digits in tens of degrees relative to the true north. If wind speed is less than or equal to , the wind direction will be displayed as variable or &quot;VRB&quot;. If the wind speed is greater than 6 knots, but the direction varies more than 60° in the past 2 minutes, METAR will report the range of wind direction. For example, codice_1 suggests the wind was variable from 180° to 240° at 10 knots.

Immediately after the wind direction is the wind speed, coded in two or three digits measured in knots, km/h or m/s. If during past 10 minutes, the weather station detects more than between minimum and maximum windspeed, METAR determines a wind gust exists and reports the maximum instantaneous windspeed.

If the air is motionless, the wind will be reported as calm and coded as codice_2.

=== Visibility and runway visual range ===
Visibility measures the atmospheric opacity. It is the greatest distance where at least half of the horizon circle can be seen from the surface.

Runway visual range (RVR) is an instrument-derived measurement that suggests the horizontal distance an observer may see down the runway. In the US, for stations with RVR reporting capacity, this information is omitted from the METAR unless the visibility is at or below , or the designated instrument runway&#x27;s RVR is at or below . RVR of up to four designated runways may be reported, depending on the country.

== Regulations and conventions ==
METAR code is regulated by the World Meteorological Organization in consort with the International Civil Aviation Organization. In the United States, the code is given authority (with some US national differences from the WMO/ICAO model) under the &quot;Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1&quot; (FMH-1), which paved the way for the US Air Force Manual 15-111 on Surface Weather Observations, being the authoritative document for the US Armed Forces. A very similar code form to the METAR is the SPECI. Both codes are defined at the technical regulation level in WMO Technical Regulation No. 49, Vol II, which is copied over to the WMO Manual No. 306 and to ICAO Annex III.

Although the general format of METARs is a global standard, the specific fields used within that format vary somewhat between general international usage and usage within North America. Note that there may be minor differences between countries using the international codes as there are between those using the North American conventions — ICAO allows member countries to modify METAR code for use in their particular countries, as long as ICAO is notified.

== Examples ==

The two examples which follow illustrate the primary differences between the international and the North American METAR variations.

===International METAR codes===
The following is an example METAR from Burgas Airport in Burgas, Bulgaria. It was taken on 4 February 2005 at 16:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

METAR LBBG 041600Z 12012MPS 090V150 1400 R04/P1500N R22/P1500U +SN BKN022 OVC050 M04/M07 Q1020 NOSIG 8849//91=

*METAR indicates that the following is a standard hourly observation.
*LBBG is the ICAO airport code for Burgas Airport.
*041600Z indicates the time of the observation. It is the day of the month (04) followed by the time of day (1600 Zulu time, which equals 4:00 pm Greenwich Mean Time or 6:00 pm local time).
*12012MPS indicates the wind direction is from 120° (east-southeast) at a speed of 12 m/s (23 knots; 27 mph; 44 km/h). Speed measurements can be in knots (abbreviated KT) or metres per second (abbreviated MPS).
*090V150 indicates the wind direction is varying from 90° true (east) to 150° true (south-southeast).
*1400 indicates the prevailing visibility is .
*R04/P1500N indicates the Runway Visual Range (RVR) along runway 04 is and not changing significantly.
*R22/P1500U indicates RVR along runway 22 is and rising.
*+SN indicates snow is falling at a heavy intensity. If any precipitation begins with a minus or plus (-/+), it&#x27;s either light or heavy.
*BKN022 indicates a broken (over half the sky) cloud layer with its base at above ground level (AGL). The lowest &quot;BKN&quot; or &quot;OVC&quot; layer specifies the cloud ceiling.
*OVC050 indicates an unbroken cloud layer (overcast) with its base at above ground level (AGL). 
*M04/M07 indicates the temperature is and the dew point is . An M in front of the number indicates that the temperature/dew point is below zero Celsius.
*Q1020 indicates the current altimeter setting (in QNH) is .
*NOSIG is an example of a TREND forecast which is appended to METARs at stations while a forecaster is on watch. NOSIG means that no significant change is expected to the reported conditions within the next 2 hours.
*8849//91 indicates the condition of the runway.
** The first two characters indicate which runway is being described.
*** If there are two or more runways with the same number, some locations will use three characters (e.g. 25L and 25R). Otherwise, the left runway will use just its number and the right runway will add 50 (e.g. 25 = 25L and 75 = 25R).
*** 88 indicates all the airport&#x27;s runways.
*** 99 indicates repetition of the last message as no new information received.
** 4 means the runway is coated with dry snow
** 9 means 51% to 100% of the runway is covered
** // means the thickness of the coating was either not measurable or not affecting usage of the runway
** 91 means the braking index is bad, in other words the tires have bad grip on the runway
*CAVOK is an abbreviation for Ceiling And Visibility OK, indicating no cloud below or the highest minimum sector altitude and no cumulonimbus or towering cumulus at any level, a visibility of or more and no significant weather change.
*= indicates the end of the METAR

===North American METAR codes===
North American METARs deviate from the WMO (who write the code on behalf of ICAO) FM 15-XII code. Details are listed in the FAA&#x27;s &quot;Aeronautical Information Manual&quot; (&quot;AIM&quot;), but the non-compliant elements are mostly based on the use of non-standard units of measurement. This METAR example is from Trenton-Mercer Airport near Trenton, New Jersey, and was taken on 5 December 2003 at 18:53 UTC.

METAR KTTN 051853Z 04011KT 1/2SM VCTS SN FZFG BKN003 OVC010 M02/M02 A3006 RMK AO2 TSB40 SLP176 P0002 T10171017=

*METAR indicates that the following is a standard hourly observation.
*KTTN is the ICAO identifier for the Trenton-Mercer Airport.
*051853Z indicates the day of the month is the 5th and the time of day is 1853 Zulu/UTC, or 1:53PM Eastern Standard Time.
*04011KT indicates the wind is from 040° true (north east) at . In the United States, the wind direction must have a 60° or greater variance for variable wind direction to be reported and the wind speed must be greater than .
*1/2SM indicates the prevailing visibility is SM = statute mile.
*VCTS indicates a thunderstorm (TS) in the vicinity (VC), which means from .
*SN indicates snow is falling at a moderate intensity; a preceding plus or minus sign (+/-) indicates heavy or light precipitation. Without a +/- sign, moderate precipitation is assumed.
*FZFG indicates the presence of freezing fog.
*BKN003 OVC010 indicates a broken ( to of the sky covered) cloud layer at above ground level (AGL) and an overcast (8/8 of the sky covered) layer at .
*M02/M02 indicates the temperature is and the dew point is . An M in front of the number indicates a negative Celsius temperature/dew point (&quot;minus&quot;).
*A3006 indicates the altimeter setting is .
*RMK indicates the remarks section follows.

Note that what follows are not part of standard observations outside of the United States and can vary significantly.

*AO2 indicates that the station is automated with a precipitation discriminator (rain/snow) sensor. Stations that aren&#x27;t equipped with a rain/snow sensor are designated AO1.
*TSB40 indicates the thunderstorm began at 40 minutes past the hour at 1840 Zulu/UTC, or 1:40 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
*SLP176 indicates the current barometric pressure extrapolated to sea level is .
*P0002 indicates that of liquid-equivalent precipitation accumulated during the last hour.
*T10171017 is a breakdown of the temperature and dew point in eight digits separated into two groups of four. The first four digits (1017) indicate the temperature. The first digit (1) designates above or below zero Celsius (0=above zero 1=below zero). The next three digits in the group &quot;017&quot; give the temperature in degrees and tenths of a degree Celsius, . The last four digits &quot;1017&quot; indicate the dew point, . Note: ASOS software, as of this update, uses whole degrees in °F to compute the °C values in this group.
*= indicates the end of the METAR.
In Canada, RMK is followed by a description of the cloud layers and opacities, in eighths (oktas). For example, CU5 would indicate a cumulus layer with opacity.

==Flight categories in the US ==
METARs can be expressed concisely using so-called &quot;aviation flight categories&quot;, which indicates what classes of flight can operate at each airport by referring to the visibility and ceiling in each METAR. Four categories are used in the US:

== METAR weather codes ==

METAR abbreviations used in the weather and events section. Remarks section will also include begin and end times of the weather events. Codes before remarks will be listed as &quot;-RA&quot; for &quot;light rain&quot;. Codes listed after remarks may be listed as &quot;RAB15E25&quot; for &quot;Rain began at 15 minutes after the top of the last hour and ended at 25 minutes after the top of the last hour.&quot;

Combinations of two precipitation types are accepted; &quot;e.g.&quot;, RASN (rain and snow mixed), SHGSSN &quot;etc&quot;. If more than one type of weather is present, METAR will report in the following order:
# Tornadic activity
# Thunderstorm
# Most dominating weather
# Precipitation
# Obscuration

=== US METAR abbreviations ===
The following METAR abbreviations are used in the United States; some are used worldwide:

<doc id="466807" wikidata="Q880723" url="?curid=466807" title="Blackburn, Victoria">
<text>Blackburn is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Whitehorse local government area. Blackburn recorded a population of 14,478 at the 2021 census.

The origin of the name Blackburn is not certain, but may have been after an early settler or James Blackburn, who designed Yan Yean Reservoir.

Blackburn is bounded in the west by Middleborough Road, in the north by Springfield Road, in the east by an irregular line along streets to the east of Blackburn Lake Sanctuary - known as the Bellbird area - and in the south by Canterbury Road.

==History==

Europeans first settled the area of Blackburn in the 1841s. The area was densely wooded, though orchards and small farms were soon developed. In 1861 the Traveller&#x27;s Rest Hotel was built on the current site of the Blackburn Hotel. Blackburn Creek Post Office opened on 10 January 1876 and was renamed Blackburn in 1883.

During the land boom of the 1880s, brickworks and quarries were established in the area. Blackburn railway station was built in 1882. Blackburn State School was established in 1889.

Though the area near the railway station was subdivided in the nineteenth century, development was slow and most houses in the suburb were not built until after the Second World War.

A large part of Blackburn is of historical significance, as it was built around the artificial Blackburn Lake in 1889, now known as Blackburn Lake Sanctuary, with the lake in the middle of the sanctuary. This was a popular day trip destination by train in the late nineteenth century. Some Australian artists painted in the bush around the Blackburn and Box Hill areas. Of these, Roberts and McCubbin are the best known. The area is protected by strict planning controls restricting development and has retained a village atmosphere.
