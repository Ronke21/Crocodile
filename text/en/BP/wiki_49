<text>HMS &quot;Hesperus&quot; was an H-class destroyer that had originally been ordered by the Brazilian Navy with the name &quot;Juruena&quot; in the late 1930s, but was purchased by the Royal Navy after the beginning of World War II in September 1939, commissioned in 1940 as &quot;HMS Hearty&quot; and then quickly renamed as &quot;Hesperus&quot;.

&quot;Hesperus&quot; was damaged by German aircraft during the Norwegian Campaign in May 1940 and was assigned to convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols after her repairs were completed. She was assigned to the Western Approaches Command for convoy escort duties in late 1940. She was briefly assigned to Force H in 1941, but her anti-aircraft armament was deemed too weak and she was transferred to the Newfoundland Escort Force the next month for escort duties in the North Atlantic. &quot;Hesperus&quot; was transferred to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force in late 1941 and continued to escort convoys in the North Atlantic for the next three years.

She was converted to an escort destroyer in early 1943 after suffering damage from one of her two ramming attacks that sank German submarines. The ship sank two other submarines during the war by more conventional means. After the end of the war, &quot;Hesperus&quot; escorted the ships carrying the Norwegian government in exile back to Norway and served as a target ship through mid-1946. She was scrapped beginning in mid-1947.

==Description==
The warship displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft using steam provided by three Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . &quot;Hesperus&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil, giving her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 152 officers and ratings.

The vessel was designed for four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mk IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear, but &#x27;Y&#x27; gun was removed to compensate for the additional depth charges added. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, &quot;Hesperus&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were originally fitted, but this was increased to three sets of rails and eight throwers while fitting-out. The ship&#x27;s load of depth charges was increased from 20 to 110 as well.

&quot;Hesperus&quot; was completed without a director-control tower (DCT) so the three remaining 4.7-inch low-angle guns fired in local control using ranges provided by a rangefinder. She was fitted with an ASDIC set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water.

===Wartime modifications===
&quot;Hesperus&quot; had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder () AA gun while under repair in May–June 1940. The ship received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast and a Type 286 short-range surface-search radar during her mid-1941 refit. While under repair at Immingham, she received her DCT. During her early 1942 refit at Falmouth, Cornwall, the ship&#x27;s short-range AA armament was augmented by two Oerlikon guns on the wings of the ship&#x27;s bridge. In addition, her recently installed DCT and rangefinder above the bridge were replaced by a Type 271 target indication radar.

While under repair in early 1943, the ship was converted to an escort destroyer. &#x27;A&#x27; gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar and the .50-calibre machine gun mounts were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons. Additional depth charge stowage replaced the 12-pounder AA gun and &quot;Hesperus&quot; received the one-ton Mk X depth charge and four Mk IV depth-charge throwers during the same refit. &quot;Hesperus&quot; was also fitted with the Foxer acoustic decoy to protect her against German acoustically guided torpedoes.

==History==
She was originally ordered as &quot;Juruena&quot; on 16 December 1937 by the Brazilian Navy. The ship was laid down by John I. Thornycroft and Company at Woolston, Hampshire on 6 July 1938 and launched by Senhora Heitora Gallienz on 1 August 1939. The ship was purchased by the British on 5 September 1939 after the beginning of World War II. Renamed HMS &quot;Hearty&quot;, the ship was commissioned on 22 January 1940 under command of former Fleet Air Arm pilot Commander Donald Macintyre. &quot;Hearty&quot; was renamed &quot;Hesperus&quot; on 27 February, after the Hesperus of mythology, to avoid confusion with the destroyer .

The six Brazilian H-class or &quot;Havant&quot;-class destroyers initially formed the 9th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet assigned to anti-submarine protection of Scapa Flow. Upon the German occupation of Denmark, &quot;Hesperus&quot; and her sister were assigned to cover the British occupation of the Faroe Islands in mid-April. During the Norwegian Campaign, &quot;Hesperus&quot; transported elements of the Scots Guards to Mo i Rana on 15 May and was damaged by near misses from Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers that same day. The ship was sent to Dundee for repairs that lasted a month. Upon their completion, the ship was assigned to convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol duties.

In November 1940 the 9th Destroyer Flotilla was transferred to the Western Approaches Command and re-designated the 9th Escort Group. On 4 November &quot;Hesperus&quot; rescued 367 survivors from the sinking of the armed merchant cruiser HMS .

In a tropical storm in January 1941, the platform on which &#x27;B&#x27; gun was mounted was lifted until the gun pressed against the bridge. After repairs, she resumed her convoy escort duties until April when she was assigned to Force H in Gibraltar whilst Macintyre transferred to the destroyer in March. &quot;Hesperus&quot; escorted ships during Operations Tiger and Tracer in May and June. &quot;Hesperus&quot; was transferred out of Force H as her anti-aircraft capability was believed by Admiral James Somerville to be too weak for operations in the Mediterranean. She received a brief refit in Liverpool and was transferred to the Newfoundland Escort Force on 7 July.

In August 1941, &quot;Hesperus&quot; was one of the destroyers that escorted the battleship carrying Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the Atlantic Charter meeting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at Placentia Bay. The ship was structurally damaged by heavy weather and was temporarily repaired by a repair ship in Iceland and then was given permanent repairs at Immingham. Upon their completion &quot;Hesperus&quot; rejoined the 9th Escort Group before she was attached to Force H in December for convoy duties at Gibraltar.

Together with her sister , &quot;Hesperus&quot; sank the on 7 December 1941 in the Atlantic west of Gibraltar. On 15 January 1942, whilst defending Convoy HG 78, the ship&#x27;s radar detected on the surface and the captain, Lieutenant Commander A. A. Tait, ordered &quot;Hesperus&quot; to ram. Although a glancing hit, the collision was so violent that it flung the U-boat&#x27;s captain and first lieutenant from the submarine&#x27;s conning tower into the motorboat stowed on the destroyer&#x27;s deck. By dropping depth charges at their shallowest setting and hitting the submarine multiple times with 4.7-inch shells, the submarine&#x27;s crew was persuaded to abandon ship. &quot;Hesperus&quot; rescued 40 of the submarine&#x27;s crew, but was unable to board the submarine before it sank. The impact flooded part of the forward hull, buckled her starboard hull plating and bent the tips of her starboard propeller. She received temporary repairs at Gibraltar and then was given permanent repairs in Falmouth between 9 February and April.

In March 1942, the remaining five &quot;Havant&quot;-class destroyers were designated leaders of Escort Groups B-1 through B-5. Commander Tait was transferred to &quot;Harvester&quot;; and Commander A.F.St.G. Orpen assumed command of &quot;Hesperus&quot; and B-2 Escort Group when &quot;Hesperus&quot; completed repairs in April. Commander Macintyre returned to the ship when Orpen was promoted to captain in June. Whilst escorting Convoy HX 219 near Rockall on 26 December, &quot;Hesperus&quot; and the destroyer sank the by ramming. This time, the ship&#x27;s bottom was ripped open for nearly a quarter of her length and she needed three months of repairs in Liverpool.

The ship rejoined her group on 17 March and sank with her Hedgehog on 23 April 1943 whilst escorting Convoy ONS 4. Almost three weeks later, she sank whilst defending convoy SC 129 on 12 May 1943. &quot;Hesperus&quot; remained on convoy escort duties until she was refitted between January and 29 March 1944. Commander G.V. Legassick assumed command of &quot;Hesperus&quot; in March 1944 and the group escorted convoys between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom. In July 1944 the ship conveyed the body of Captain Frederic John Walker for a sea-burial.

Later in 1944 she was transferred to the 19th Escort Group. In January 1945, Commander R.A. Currie assumed command of &quot;Hesperus&quot; as commander of the 14th Escort Group, based in Plymouth. On 30 April 1945, the ship, together with her sister , attacked the wreck of northwest of the island of Anglesey thinking that it was which had been spotted by a Short Sunderland flying boat earlier that day.

Two weeks later, &quot;Hesperus&quot; and the 14th Escort Group escorted a group of surrendered German U-boats from Loch Alsh to Lough Foyle. On 27 May, the ship and her sister &quot;Havelock&quot; escorted the exiled Norwegian government back to Oslo and remained there until 1 June. Ten days later, she began service as an aircraft target, a role that lasted for the next year. &quot;Hesperus&quot; was approved for scrapping on 18 February 1946 and was placed in Category C reserve in May. She was towed to Grangemouth for scrapping, but that did not begin until 17 May 1947. &quot;Hesperus&quot;″s ensign was preserved in Yeovil Parish Church.

<text>A personal union is a combination of two or more monarchical states that have the same monarch while their boundaries, laws, and interests remain distinct. A real union, by contrast, involves the constituent states being to some extent interlinked, such as by sharing some limited governmental institutions. Unlike a personal union, in a federation or a unitary state, a central (federal) government spanning all member states exists, with the degree of self-governance distinguishing the two. The ruler in a personal union does not need to be a hereditary monarch.

The term was coined by German jurist Johann Stephan Pütter, introducing it into &quot;Elementa iuris publici germanici&quot; (Elements of German Public Law) of 1760.

Personal unions can arise for several reasons, such as:

* inheritance through a dynastic union, e.g. Louis X of France inherited France from his father and Navarre from his mother
* decolonization, where ex-colonies install the monarch of the former colonizing power as their own upon becoming independent, e.g. several former members of the British Empire (then becoming Commonwealth realms)
* autonomization, e.g. instead of annexing Finland into the Russian Empire, Alexander I of Russia organized Finland as an autonomous grand duchy and acted as its head of state

They can also be codified (i.e., the constitutions of the states clearly express that they shall share the same person as head of state) or non-codified, in which case they can easily be broken (e.g., by the death of the monarch when the two states have different succession laws).

The concept of a personal union has only very rarely crossed over from monarchies into republics.

There are currently two personal unions in the world: the 15 Commonwealth realms, who share Charles III as their head of state, and one of the co-princes of Andorra being the President of France.

** As King of Goryeo (高麗國王) and King of Shenyang (瀋陽王) in 1308–1310
** As King of Goryeo and King of Shen (瀋王) in 1310–1313

King Chungseon reigned as King of Goryeo in 1298 and 1308–1313 and as King of Shenyang or King of Shen from 1307 (according to the &quot;History of Yuan&quot;) or 1308 (according to &quot;Goryeosa&quot;) to 1316. At that time, Goryeo had already become a vassal of the Mongol Empire and the Mongol imperial family and the Goryeo royal family had established strong ties through marriage. Because he was a very powerful man during Külüg Khan&#x27;s reign, he could become the King of Shenyang where many Korean people lived in Liaodong. However, he lost his power in the Mongol imperial court after the death of the Külüg Khan. Because the Mongol Empire made Chungseon abdicate the crown of the Goryeo in 1313, the personal union was ended. King Chungsuk, Chungseon&#x27;s eldest son, became the new King of Goryeo. In 1316, the Mongol Empire made Chungseon abdicate the crown of Shen in favour of Wang Ko, one of his nephews, resulting in him becoming the new King of Shen.

====Andorra====
Due to Andorra&#x27;s special government form resulting from the Paréage of 1278, it is a diarchy with co-princes. One of them is the Bishop of Urgell, the other was originally the Count of Foix. It is through this feudal co-prince that the Principality has entered partial personal union with:

* Kingdom of Navarre (1479–1620, then integrated into France).
* Kingdom of France (1589–1792, 1814–1815, 1815–1830, 1830–1848).

In 1607 the feudal co-prince was Henry IV of France, who issued an edict that his position should be held by the French Head of State. While during the French Revolution, the new government did not take up the title, all versions of France since 1806 regardless of their government form have accepted that their head of state is an ex officio co-prince. This led to personal unions with:

* First and Second French Empires (1806–1814, 1815 and 1852–1870).
* Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Republics of France (1848–1852, 1870–1940, 1944–1958, since 1958).

==Republics in personal union==
Because heads of state and government of republics are ordinarily chosen from within the citizens of the state in question, sovereign republics very rarely share common leaders. A few examples are:

* Uniquely, the President of France is &quot;ex officio&quot; a constitutional monarch (or, more accurately, diarch) in neighboring Andorra, with the title of Co-Prince. This status was inherited from the role of the French monarchs in Andorra.
*From 1802 to 1804, the First Consul of the French Republic and the President of the Italian Republic was the same man-Napoleon Bonaparte. Bonaparte continued as President of Italy even after he was proclaimed Emperor of the French, until he was proclaimed King of Italy in 1805.
* During the later stages of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, Simón Bolívar was simultaneously President of Gran Colombia (24 February 1819 - 4 May 1830), President of Peru (10 February 1824 – 28 January 1827), and President of Bolivia (12 August 1825 - 29 December 1825). Bolívar had, as President and military Commander-in-Chief of Colombia, led a Colombian army to secure Peruvian independence in 1824-25, and was given the office of President by the Patriot republican governments of both Peru and Bolivia (renamed in his honor from &quot;Upper Peru&quot;) as an emergency measure to help secure independence from Spain. After the end of the war, Bolívar relinquished his Peruvian and Bolivian offices and returned to Colombia.
* In 1860 Marthinus Wessel Pretorius was simultaneously elected as the president of Transvaal and Orange Free State. He tried to unify the two countries, but his efforts failed, leading to the Transvaal Civil War.
* In 1335 Ivan I of Moscow was made Prince of the Novgorod Republic, marking a personal union between Muscovy and Novgorod until his death in 1340.

<text>HMS &quot;Maori&quot; was a destroyer named after the indigenous Māori people of New Zealand. She served with the United Kingdom Mediterranean Fleet during World War II until she was bombed and sunk by German aircraft while at Malta in 1942. Her wreck was later raised and scuttled outside the Grand Harbour. The wreck is now a dive site.

==Description==
The Tribals were intended to counter the large destroyers being built abroad and to improve the firepower of the existing destroyer flotillas and were thus significantly larger and more heavily armed than the preceding . The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The destroyers were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . During her sea trials &quot;Maori&quot; made from at a displacement of . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement consisted of 190 officers and ratings, although the flotilla leaders carried an extra 20 officers and men consisting of the Captain (D) and his staff.

The primary armament of the Tribal-class destroyers was eight quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XII guns in four superfiring twin-gun mounts, one pair each fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. The mounts had a maximum elevation of 40°. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they carried a single quadruple mount for the QF two-pounder Mk II &quot;pom-pom&quot; gun and two quadruple mounts for the 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) Mark III machine gun. Low-angle fire for the main guns was controlled by the director-control tower (DCT) on the bridge roof that fed data acquired by it and the rangefinder on the Mk II Rangefinder/Director directly aft of the DCT to an analogue mechanical computer, the Mk I Admiralty Fire Control Clock. Anti-aircraft fire for the main guns was controlled by the Rangefinder/Director which sent data to the mechanical Fuze Keeping Clock.

The ships were fitted with a single above-water quadruple mount for  torpedoes. The Tribals were not intended as anti-submarine ships, but they were provided with ASDIC, one depth charge rack and two throwers for self-defence, although the throwers were not mounted in all ships; Twenty depth charges was the peacetime allotment, but this increased to 30 during wartime.

===Wartime modifications===
Heavy losses to German air attack during the Norwegian Campaign demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the Tribals&#x27; anti-aircraft suite and the RN decided in May 1940 to replace &#x27;X&#x27; mount with two QF Mark XVI dual-purpose guns in a twin-gun mount. To better control the guns, the existing rangefinder/director was modified to accept a Type 285 gunnery radar as they became available. The number of depth charges was increased to 46 early in the war, and still more were added later. To increase the firing arcs of the AA guns, the rear funnel was shortened and the mainmast was reduced to a short pole mast.

== Construction and career ==
Authorized as one of seven Tribal-class destroyers under the 1935 Naval Estimates, &quot;Maori&quot; was the second ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was ordered on 10 March 1936 from Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company and was laid down on 6 July at the company&#x27;s Govan shipyard. She was launched on 2 September 1937 by Mrs. W. J. Jordan, the wife of the New Zealand High Commissioner Bill Jordan. &quot;Maori&quot; was completed on 30 November 1938 and commissioned on 5 December at a cost of £340,622 which excluded weapons and communications outfits furnished by the Admiralty.

&quot;Maori&quot; joined &#x27;s division in January 1939 and joined the Mediterranean Fleet. She and the other Tribal-class destroyers did convoy escort duties, and &quot;Maori&quot; then returned to Britain in October. Until April 1940 she patrolled the North Sea and also took part in the Norwegian Campaign. In June she sailed to Iceland looking for German warships and also served briefly in the Faroe Islands.

In May 1941, she participated in the pursuit and destruction of the . While escorting Convoy WS-8B to the Middle East, &quot;Maori&quot;, along with the destroyers &quot;Cossack&quot;, and broke off on 26 May and headed towards the area where &quot;Bismarck&quot; had been reported. They found her that evening and made several torpedo attacks in the evening and into the next morning. No hits were scored but they kept her gunners from getting any sleep, making it easier for the battleships to attack her the next morning. &quot;Maori&quot; then rescued some of the survivors from &quot;Bismarck&quot; after the battleship sank.
She served with the 14th Destroyer Flotilla during the Battle of Cape Bon in December 1941. &quot;Maori&quot;, commanded by Commander R. E. Courage, RN, was attacked by German aircraft and sunk at her moorings in the Malta Grand Harbour on 12 February 1942, with the loss of one of her crew; she was raised and scuttled off Fort Saint Elmo on 15 July 1945.

==Wreck==

Located a few hundred metres from the shore from Valletta, HMS &quot;Maori&quot; is now a popular dive site. The bow section lies in white sand at a depth of , the aft section of the ship having been abandoned in deep water during the tow from Grand Harbour to Marsamxett Harbour. Much of the forward superstructure is extant, including the two front gun bases. Much marine life can be found on the wreck.

<doc id="475810" wikidata="Q16928416" url="?curid=475810" title="Linear induction motor">
<text>A linear induction motor (LIM) is an alternating current (AC), asynchronous linear motor that works by the same general principles as other induction motors but is typically designed to directly produce motion in a straight line. Characteristically, linear induction motors have a finite primary or secondary length, which generates end-effects, whereas a conventional induction motor is arranged in an endless loop.

Despite their name, not all linear induction motors produce linear motion; some linear induction motors are employed for generating rotations of large diameters where the use of a continuous primary would be very expensive.

As with rotary motors, linear motors frequently run on a three-phase power supply and can support very high speeds. However, there are end-effects that reduce the motor&#x27;s force, and it is often not possible to fit a gearbox to trade off force and speed. Linear induction motors are thus frequently less energy efficient than normal rotary motors for any given required force output.

LIMs, unlike their rotary counterparts, can give a levitation effect. They are therefore often used where contactless force is required, where low maintenance is desirable, or where the duty cycle is low. Their practical uses include magnetic levitation, linear propulsion, and linear actuators. They have also been used for pumping liquid metals.

==History==
The history of linear electric motors can be traced back at least as far as the 1840s to the work of Charles Wheatstone at King&#x27;s College in London, but Wheatstone&#x27;s model was too inefficient to be practical. A feasible linear induction motor is described in US patent 782312 (1905; inventor Alfred Zehden of Frankfurt-am-Main), and is for driving trains or lifts. German engineer Hermann Kemper built a working model in 1935. In the late 1940s, professor Eric Laithwaite of Imperial College in London developed the first full-size working model.
In a single-sided version, the magnetic field can create repulsion forces that push the conductor away from the stator, levitating it and carrying it along the direction of the moving magnetic field. Laithwaite called the later versions a magnetic river. These versions of the linear induction motor use a principle called &quot;transverse flux&quot; where two opposite poles are placed side by side. This permits very long poles to be used, and thus permits high speed and efficiency.

==Construction==
A linear induction motor&#x27;s primary typically consists of a flat magnetic core (generally laminated) with transverse slots that are often straight cut with coils laid into the slots, with each phase giving an alternating polarity so that the different phases physically overlap.

The secondary is frequently a sheet of aluminium, often with an iron backing plate. Some LIMs are double sided with one primary on each side of the secondary, and, in this case, no iron backing is needed.

Two types of linear motor exist: a &quot;short primary&quot;, where the coils are truncated shorter than the secondary, and a &quot;short secondary&quot;, where the conductive plate is smaller. Short secondary LIMs are often wound as parallel connections between coils of the same phase, whereas short primaries are usually wound in series.

The primaries of transverse flux LIMs have a series of twin poles lying transversely side-by-side with opposite winding directions. These poles are typically made either with a suitably cut laminated backing plate or a series of transverse U-cores.

==Principles==

In this electric motor design, the force is produced by a linearly moving magnetic field acting on conductors in the field. Any conductor, be it a loop, a coil, or simply a piece of plate metal, that is placed in this field will have eddy currents induced in it thus creating an opposing magnetic field in accordance with Lenz&#x27;s law. The two opposing fields will repel each other, creating motion as the magnetic field sweeps through the metal.

where is supply frequency in Hz, is the number of poles, and is the synchronous speed of the magnetic field in revolutions per second.

The travelling field pattern has a velocity of:
:formula_2
where is velocity of the linear travelling field in m/s, and is the pole pitch.

For a slip of , the speed of the secondary in a linear motor is given by
:formula_3

==Forces==

===Thrust===

The drive generated by linear induction motors is somewhat similar to conventional induction motors; the drive forces show a roughly similar characteristic shape relative to slip, albeit modulated by end effects.

Equations exist for calculating the thrust of a motor.

===End effect===
Unlike a circular induction motor, a linear induction motor shows &#x27;end effects&#x27;. These end effects include losses in performance and efficiency that are believed to be caused by magnetic energy being carried away and lost at the end of the primary by the relative movement of the primary and secondary.

With a short secondary, the behaviour is almost identical to a rotary machine, provided it is at least two poles long but with a short primary reduction in thrust that occurs at low slip (below about 0.3) until it is eight poles or longer.

However, because of end effects, linear motors cannot &#x27;run light&#x27; -- normal induction motors are able to run the motor with a near synchronous field under low load conditions. In contrast, end effects create much more significant losses with linear motors.

===Levitation===

In addition, unlike a rotary motor, an electrodynamic levitation force is shown, this is zero at zero slip, and gives a roughly constant amount of force/gap as slip increases in either direction. This occurs in single sided motors, and levitation will not usually occur when an iron backing plate is used on the secondary, since this causes an attraction that overwhelms the lifting force.
==Performance==
Linear induction motors are often less efficient than conventional rotary induction motors; the end effects and the relatively large air gap that is often present will typically reduce the forces produced for the same electrical power. Similarly, the efficiency during generator operation (electric braking/recuperating) with a linear induction motor was reported as relatively low due to end effects. The larger air gap also increases the inductance of the motor which can require larger and more expensive capacitors.

However, linear induction motors can avoid the need for gearboxes and similar drivetrains, and these have their own losses; and working knowledge of the importance of the goodness factor can minimise the effects of the larger air gap. In any case power use is not always the most important consideration. For example, in many cases linear induction motors have far fewer moving parts, and have very low maintenance. Also, using linear induction motors instead of rotating motors with rotary-to-linear transmissions in motion control systems, enables higher bandwidth and accuracy of the control system, because rotary-to-linear transmissions introduce backlash, static friction and/or mechanical compliance in the control system.

==Uses==

Because of these properties, linear motors are often used in maglev propulsion, as in the Japanese Linimo magnetic levitation train line near Nagoya.
The world&#x27;s first commercial automated maglev system was a low-speed maglev shuttle that ran from the airport terminal of Birmingham Airport to the nearby Birmingham International railway station between 1984–1995. The length of the track was , and trains &quot;flew&quot; at an altitude of , levitated by electromagnets, and propelled with linear induction motors. It was in operation for nearly eleven years, but obsolescence problems with the electronic systems made it unreliable in its later years. One of the original cars is now on display at Railworld in Peterborough, together with the RTV31 hover train vehicle.

However, linear motors have been used independently of magnetic levitation, such as Tokyo&#x27;s Toei Ōedo Line. The Bombardier Innovia Metro is an example of an automated system that utilizes LIM propulsion. The longest rapid transit system employing such technology is the Guangzhou Metro, with approximately of route using LIM propelled subway trains along Line 4, Line 5 and Line 6. They are also used by the SkyTrain (Vancouver), the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover at Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, and the Subway people mover at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, which uses the same design.

Linear induction motor technology is also used in some launched roller coasters. At present it is still impractical on street running trams, although this, in theory, could be done by burying it in a slotted conduit.
Outside of public transportation, vertical linear motors have been proposed as lifting mechanisms in deep mines, and the use of linear motors is growing in motion control applications. They are also often used on sliding doors, such as those of low floor trams such as the Alstom Citadis and the Eurotram.

Dual axis linear motors also exist. These specialized devices have been used to provide direct &quot;X&quot;-&quot;Y&quot; motion for precision laser cutting of cloth and sheet metal, automated drafting, and cable forming. Also, linear induction motors with a cylindrical secondary have been used to provide simultaneous linear and rotating motion for mounting electronic devices on printed circuit boards.

Most linear motors in use are LIM (linear induction motors) or LSM (linear synchronous motors). Linear DC motors are not used as it includes more cost and linear SRM suffers from poor thrust. So for long run in traction LIM is mostly preferred and for short run LSM is mostly preferred.
Linear induction motors have also been used for launching aircraft, the Westinghouse Electropult system in 1945 was an early example and the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) was due to be delivered in 2010.

Linear induction motors are also used in looms, magnetic levitation enable bobbins to float between the fibers without direct contact.

The first ropeless elevator invented by ThyssenKrupp uses a linear induction drive power.

<doc id="475811" wikidata="Q1073468" url="?curid=475811" title="Pinhead Gunpowder">
<text>Pinhead Gunpowder is an American punk rock band that formed in East Bay, California, in 1991. The band currently consists of Aaron Cometbus (drums, lyrics), Bill Schneider (bass), Billie Joe Armstrong (guitar, vocals) and Jason White (guitar, vocals). The band&#x27;s name comes from a brand of &quot;high octane&quot; green tea served at the Arcata co-op and discovered by Aaron Cometbus during one of his many dumpster diving adventures.

==History==
Pinhead Gunpowder was founded in Arcata, California in January 1991 by Aaron Cometbus and Jon Quittner. Cometbus wanted the name &quot;Pinhead Gunpowder&quot;, while Quittner wanted to call it &quot;50 Foot Hesher&quot;. Along with vocalist Doug &quot;Douggie Grime&quot; Rogers and bassist David &quot;Atlas&quot; Kimmel, the band played once at a party where Cometbus snapped his bass pedal in half in the middle of the set. Shortly after the show, Cometbus moved back to Berkeley, taking the name of the band and some of the songs with him. Quittner stayed in Arcata with the band and they changed their name to 50 Foot Hesher and acquired a new drummer. A few months later, Quittner left the band and the remaining members changed the name to &quot;Lank&quot;.

Back in Berkeley, Cometbus formed the second incarnation of Pinhead Gunpowder with Bill Schneider and Sarah Kirsch of The Skinflutes, and Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day. In June 1991, they recorded their first EP, &quot;Tründle and Spring&quot;. It was not until April of the following year that the band played their first live show at Punks With Presses in Oakland along with Rancid and The Gr&#x27;Ups. The band then released their second EP, &quot;Fahizah&quot;. In 1993, Kirsch left the band. Rumors that the reason was differences with Armstrong&#x27;s decision to sign to a major label with Green Day were debunked by the band on Damian Abraham&#x27;s podcast Turned Out a Punk. Kirsch was replaced by Jason White of Chino Horde. White would later also become Green Day&#x27;s touring guitarist. Shortly after, the band embarked on a week long tour of Northern California, Oregon, and Washington in the winter of 1994.

Pinhead Gunpowder performed for the first time in many years during February 2008, debuting three new songs, &quot;Anniversary Song&quot;, &quot;West Side Highway&quot;, and &quot;On the Ave&quot;.

The band released their latest EP, &quot;West Side Highway&quot; through Recess Records on August 19, 2008. This marked the band&#x27;s first new release in 5 years.

Pinhead Gunpowder released a greatest hits album called &quot;Kick Over the Traces&quot; on June 19, 2009. Also, Pinhead Gunpowder mentioned that in August or September Recess would re-release on vinyl and CD the albums &quot;Jump Salty&quot;, &quot;Carry the Banner&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Ellston Avenue&quot;, &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; and &quot;Compulsive Disclosure&quot;. All of the albums were re-released in assorted colors in early February 2010 through Recess Records, but quickly recalled and destroyed at the request of the band due to issues with the vinyl pressing. The band last performed at a benefit show at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California, on February 12, 2010.

Band member Sarah Kirsch died in 2012. She had been diagnosed with Fanconi anemia, a genetic disorder that can cause leukemia and other cancers.

In March 2021, the band re-issued their entire discography on vinyl.

On September 5, 2024, the band returned with a new single, &quot;Unt&quot;. A new album, also titled &quot;Unt&quot;, was released on October 18, 2024.

During Pinhead Gunpowder&#x27;s first incarnation, Cometbus and Quittner wrote a handful of songs together, including &quot;In Control&quot;, &quot;Losers of the Year&quot;, &quot;Certain Things&quot;, &quot;Brother&quot;, &quot;I Used To&quot;, &quot;Stab You in the Eye&quot;, and &quot;Cuidado&quot; (The last two songs released by Quittner and Cometbus under the band name &quot;Mundt&quot;). Cometbus often borrows songs recorded by his other bands to release as Pinhead Gunpowder songs, including &quot;Train Station&quot; from Shotwell Coho, &quot;The Great Divide&quot; from Redmond Shooting Stars, &quot;Asheville&quot; from Cleveland Bound Death Sentence, and &quot;On the Ave&quot; and &quot;Landlords&quot; from Astrid Oto. Only three Pinhead Gunpowder songs have been written by Billie Joe Armstrong, under the name &quot;Wilhelm Fink&quot;: &quot;27&quot;, &quot;New Blood&quot;, and &quot;Anniversary Song&quot;.

== Influences ==
The bands influences are Ramones, Joni Mitchell, The Replacements, Generation X, Swiz, Code Of Honor, Avengers, and Cheap Trick. They have also done cover versions of many of the songs by these bands or artists.

<text>Ralph Julian Canine (November 9, 1895 – March 8, 1969) was a lieutenant general in the United States Army and the first director of the National Security Agency.

==Early life and education==
Canine was born in 1895 in Flora, Indiana, one of two children of the local superintendent of schools. When he left home, he was intent on being a doctor, and had completed pre-med studies at Northwestern University when he entered the United States Army during World War I and was commissioned a second lieutenant.

==Military career==

Canine served in various combat posts in France during World War I, and elected to stay in the army after the armistice was signed in 1918. The interwar period was his education, when he traveled from one army post to another, filling just about any job that was vacant. When World War II broke out, Canine was well-fitted for responsibility. He became the chief of staff for the XII Corps, which served in General George S. Patton&#x27;s Third Army during its race across France in 1944. In that capacity, he was twice decorated by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics receiving the Order of the Patriotic War First Class and Bravery Medal when XII Corps linked up with Red Army units. After the war, he was rewarded with command of the 1st Infantry Division.

In 1951 Canine became director of the Armed Forces Security Agency, which was America&#x27;s first tentative step toward cryptologic unification. He was there long enough (one year) to see what the organization lacked. When President Harry S. Truman created the National Security Agency in 1952, Canine continued as its first director. He died unexpectedly of a pulmonary embolism in March 1969. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

<doc id="475813" wikidata="Q661662" url="?curid=475813" title="Matt Freeman">
<text>Roger Matthew Freeman, also known as Matt McCall (born April 23, 1966) is an American musician. He is best known for his bass work with the punk rock bands Operation Ivy, Rancid and as the frontman of Devil&#x27;s Brigade.

== Playing style ==
In an interview streamed from the Rancid website before the release of &quot;Rancid&quot; (2000), he revealed that his style was heavily influenced at an early age by John Entwistle, bassist for the Who. He plays both with a pick and fingerstyle.

Freeman&#x27;s playing style is considered atypical in the punk rock world due to his frequent use of scales and arpeggios as opposed to &quot;motoring&quot; through a chord progression&#x27;s root notes as is typical of punk bass playing.

== Singing style ==
Although Armstrong and Frederiksen are the principal singers in Rancid, Freeman has taken the lead vocal duties in a number of gritty sounding songs through the years, including the songs &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, &quot;Rigged on a Fix&quot;, &quot;Black Derby Jacket&quot;, &quot;Tenderloin&quot; and, &quot;L.A. River&quot;. He is known for possessing a deep and raspy singing voice. Freeman was also the primary co-lead vocal for the first Rancid album, before Frederiksen joined the band, with his role subsequently being reduced by choice.

== Gear ==
Freeman plays Fender Precision and Jazz Basses. His 1977 Fender Precision was used as the basis for the 2011 Squier Matt Freeman Signature Bass.

He has also played Music Man Stingrays, Ibanez ATK&#x27;s and Rickenbacker 4003&#x27;s in the past.

== Bands ==
=== Operation Ivy and Downfall ===
In May 1987, Freeman and Armstrong formed the band Operation Ivy. After Operation Ivy broke up in May 1989, they formed a new band, Downfall, which included all but one member of Operation Ivy and two additional members. Downfall recorded a 10-song album which has never been released, then broke up. Freeman and Armstrong next formed Generator, who played a number of shows, but are not known to have recorded anything. After that, Freeman played with the political punk band MDC for about a year.

=== Dance Hall Crashers ===
After Operation Ivy, Freeman and Armstrong formed the ska band the Dance Hall Crashers, but they left the band shortly after its formation. The band went on to become moderately successful throughout the 90s.

=== MDC ===
He joined MDC in 1990, completing one US and one European tour and playing bass on their 1991 release &quot;Millions Of Dead Cops II: Hey Cop! If I Had A Face Like Yours...&quot; The lineup for this version of the band consisted of Freeman, original singer Dave Dictor, original drummer Al Schvitz and guitarist Bill Collins, formerly of Fang, Special Forces and Intensified Chaos.

=== Gr&#x27;ups and Rancid ===
He joined the Gr&#x27;ups in 1991. In 1992, Freeman and Armstrong recruited drummer Brett Reed and formed Rancid. Rancid is his most successful band yet. He considered Rancid a side project until Armstrong had proved to him that he had his alcoholism under control. Guitarist Lars Frederiksen joined the band later in 1993. The band released their tenth album, &quot;Tomorrow Never Comes&quot;, in June 2023. Their partnership has continued with Freeman contributing basslines to selected tracks by the Transplants, one of Armstrong&#x27;s side projects.

=== Social Distortion ===
During Rancid&#x27;s 2004 hiatus, Freeman replaced bassist John Maurer in Social Distortion shortly before the release of their then-new album &quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. Freeman did not intend to stay in the band permanently and he was replaced by current bassist Brent Harding in late 2004.

=== Charger===
In 2020 Matt formed a heavy metal band, Charger.

=== The Crew ===

In May 2021, Freeman along with fellow Rancid bandmate Tim Armstrong, Fletcher Dragge (Pennywise), Byron McCracken (Pennywise), and Mike Muir (Suicidal Tendencies) formed a punk rock supergroup called the Crew. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;One Voice&quot;, was released on Epitaph Records.

== Health issues ==
Following his departure from Social Distortion, Freeman was diagnosed with lung cancer in May 2005, but was dismissed as abnormal tissue growth and not terminal to his health in June 2005. He had been a smoker for 20 years but had quit, seemingly by coincidence, shortly prior to this. He learned to play the mandolin so he would have something to do with his hands as heard on the Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards album &quot;Viking&quot;.

<text>An Lushan (; 20th day of the 1st month (19 February) 703 – 29 January 757) was a Chinese military general and rebel leader during the Tang dynasty and is primarily known for instigating the An Lushan Rebellion which devastated China and killed millions of people.

An Lushan was of Sogdian and Göktürk origin, at least by adoption. He rose to prominence as a general by defending the northeastern Tang frontier from the Khitans and other threats. Through his frequent visits to Chang&#x27;an, the Tang capital, An Lushan managed to gain favour with Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and Chancellor Li Linfu. By 751, he had been appointed military governor over three prefectures. After the death of Li Linfu in 753, An Lushan&#x27;s rivalry with General Geshu Han and Chancellor Yang Guozhong created military tensions within the empire.

In late 755, An Lushan instigated open revolt and quickly captured Luoyang, the eastern capital, where in early 756 he proclaimed himself emperor of the new Yan dynasty. While his generals continued his campaigns, An Lushan remained in the Luoyang palace; his health failed and he became increasingly violent and paranoid. In early 757 he was murdered by a eunuch with the support of his son, An Qingxu.

==Background and name==
An Lushan&#x27;s mother was a Göktürk of the Ashide clan and served as a sorceress. According to historical sources, his original name might have been Aluoshan or Yaluoshan, the latter stated in the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; to mean &quot;war&quot; in Old Turkic. His father died early, and his mother Lady Ashide married a Turkic general An Yanyan (), who was a brother of general An Bozhi (). An Lushan, therefore, took the surname An. Early in Emperor Xuanzong of Tang&#x27;s &quot;Kaiyuan&quot; era, 713–741, there was a disturbance among the Göktürk tribe that An Yanyan belonged to, and An Lushan fled to Tang with An Yanyan and An Yanyan&#x27;s nephew, An Sishun. He later settled in Ying Prefecture (營州, roughly modern Chaoyang, Liaoning).

===Paternity===
Sources conflict about An Lushan&#x27;s biological father&#x27;s origin and surname; for example, whether An Lushan&#x27;s father had the surname Kang or not: he took the name of An from his stepfather An Yanyan. The surnames Kang and An suggest that they were respectively from the Sogdian kingdoms of Samarkand (康國; cf. Kangju) and Bukhara (). The An are not to be confused with Anxi, which had been established as a prefecture by the Chinese in 661.

On his side, Matsui Hitoshi, noting that nothing in the historical records provides hard evidence of Sogdian origin and that An Lushan was living at Yingzhou, a settlement of Kumo Xi and Khitan people, suggests that &quot;Perhaps [An Lushan&#x27;s father] might have been of Khitan origin.&quot; Edward H. Schafer, however, maintains that An Lushan is probably the Sinicized version of a name derived from &quot;Anxi&quot; (安息 &quot;Parthia(n)&quot;) and the common Sogdian name ܪܘܚܫܐܢ &quot;Roxshan&quot; &quot;the Bright&quot; related to the Sogdian female name &quot;Roxana&quot;, also borne by Alexander&#x27;s Sogdian wife, Roxana. His name has also been transcribed as &quot;Āluòshān&quot; () or &quot;Yàluòshān&quot; (), and he was posthumously named Prince La of Yan () by his deputy Shi Siming.

==Youth==
It was said that An Lushan knew six non-Chinese languages, and, after he grew older, served as an interpreter in one of the military markets, which were set up by the Chinese government largely to obtain horses in exchange for silk through foreign trade. Serving with him was Shi Sugan (later named Shi Siming), who was one day older than he was and who became a good friend of his. In 732, when the general Zhang Shougui () was governing You Prefecture (幽州, roughly modern Beijing), it was discovered that An Lushan had stolen sheep. Zhang was set to execute An Lushan by caning, when An Lushan yelled out, &quot;Is it that you, Lord, do not wish to destroy the two barbarian tribes? Why do you want to cane An Lushan to death?&quot; Zhang, seeing that he had a large body and impressed by his plea, released him and had him serve as a police officer, along with Shi, and both of them were said to be capable at catching criminals. Later, Zhang promoted him to be a military officer. As Zhang believed that he was obese, he did not dare to eat too much while in Zhang&#x27;s presence, and this drew Zhang&#x27;s favor. Zhang took him in and treated him like a son. At a time that was not recorded in history, he married a Lady Kang as his first wife; they had at least one son, An Qingxu, who, however, was not his oldest son.

==Service in Tang armies==

===Rise through the ranks (736–742)===

By 736, An Lushan carried a general title and was serving under Zhang Shougui as an officer of the Pinglu Army (平盧軍, based in modern Chaoyang). In 736, after An disobeyed Zhang&#x27;s orders and made an overly aggressive attack against the Khitan and the Xi, he was defeated. According to army regulations, he was supposed to be executed. Zhang then sent him to the capital, Chang&#x27;an; by not executing An himself, Zhang was hoping that Emperor Xuanzong would pardon An. The chancellor Zhang Jiuling, arguing that An&#x27;s death would be necessary to preserve military discipline and further believing that An had the appearance of a rebel, advocated An&#x27;s death, but Emperor Xuanzong believed An to be able and did not want to execute him, and therefore spared him but stripped him of titles, returning him to serve under Zhang.

In 740, An became the &quot;Bingmashi&quot; () of Pinglu Army. In 741, when the deputy chief imperial censor Zhang Lizhen () was sent to survey the Hebei (河北, i.e., the region north of the Yellow River) and visited Pinglu Army, An ingratiated himself with Zhang, so much so that he even bribed Zhang&#x27;s servants. When Zhang returned to Chang&#x27;an and praised An, Emperor Xuanzong promoted An to be the commandant at Ying Prefecture and the commander of Pinglu Army, to defend against the Khitan, the Xi, Balhae, and the Heishui Mohe. In 742, Xuanzong further promoted Pinglu Army to be a military circuit, making An its military governor (&quot;jiedushi&quot;).

===At Chang&#x27;an (743)===
In 743, An visited Chang&#x27;an to pay homage to Emperor Xuanzong. Emperor Xuanzong treated him well and allowed him to visit the palace at all times. He began to inject himself into court politics—as the official Su Xiaoyun () complained to him that the imperial examinations that year was unfair and that Zhang Shi (), the son of the deputy chief imperial censor Zhang Yi (), had been given top grade despite having no abilities. An reported this to Emperor Xuanzong, who ordered a retesting before him personally. Zhang Shi was not able to even write one character in response to Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s reexamination. As a result, the deputy ministers of civil service, Song Yao () and Miao Jinqing were demoted.

An often pleased Emperor Xuanzong by offering Emperor Xuanzong tributes of rare items, such as rare animals or jewels. By this time, he was even more obese than before, and Emperor Xuanzong, on one occasion, jokingly asked him, &quot;What does this barbaric belly contain?&quot; He responded, &quot;Other than a faithful heart, there is nothing else.&quot; On another occasion, when Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s son Li Heng the Crown Prince was in audience, he refused to bow to Li Heng, stating, &quot;I am a barbarian, and I do not understand formal ceremony. What is a crown prince?&quot; Emperor Xuanzong responded, &quot;He is the reserve emperor. After my death, he will be your emperor.&quot; An apologized, stating, &quot;I am foolish. I had only known about Your Imperial Majesty, and not that there is such a thing as a reserve emperor.&quot; He bowed, but Emperor Xuanzong, believing him to be honest, favored him even more. As he was allowed to enter the palace, he asked that he become an adoptive son of Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s favorite concubine Consort Yang Guifei, and Emperor Xuanzong agreed. Thereafter, on one occasion, he bowed to Consort Yang first before bowing to Emperor Xuanzong, stating, &quot;Barbarians bow to mothers first before fathers.&quot; Xuanzong, now believing An was as submissive to him as a son to a father, showed him even greater favors.

===Return to the north front===

In 744, with further praises from the powerful chancellor Li Linfu and Pei Kuan, An was, in addition to Pinglu, made the military governor of Fanyang Circuit (范陽, headquartered in modern Beijing). Wanting to show his military abilities, he often pillaged the Khitan and the Xi. His actions led to two princesses of the royal clan, who were married to Khitan and Xi leaders as part of the heqin policy, being executed in retaliation, and both groups rebelled in 745, though An defeated them.

According to the Song dynasty historian Sima Guang, it was said that An was attempting to increase his own strength and planning a rebellion, and in 747, he claimed to be building Fort Xiongwu () and asked fellow military governor Wang Zhongsi to contribute troops, hoping to hold onto the troops that Wang would send and not return them. Wang, instead, led the troops himself to Xiongwu in advance of the rendezvous date and, after participating in the building project, returned with the soldiers, and submitted reports to Emperor Xuanzong that he believed An was planning treason. Li Linfu, who was at this point apprehensive of Wang as a potential rival, used this as one of the reasons to indict Wang, and Wang was, later in 747, removed from his post. Also in 747, An Lushan was given the honorary title as chief deputy imperial censor (御史大夫, &quot;Yùshǐ Dàfū&quot;), and Lady Duan, now described as his wife, although Lady Kang was still alive, was created a lady.

In 748, Emperor Xuanzong awarded An Lushan an iron certificate promising that he would not be executed, except for treason, and in 750, he created A Prince of Dongping, setting a precedent for generals not of the imperial Li clan to be created princes.

===New period in Chang&#x27;an===
By this point, a friendship had developed between An Lushan and the Emperor. When An went to Chang&#x27;an later that year to pay homage to Emperor Xuanzong, he presented Emperor Xuanzong with 8,000 Xi captives. In 751, Xuanzong had a magnificent mansion built for An in Chang&#x27;an, sparing no expense, using jade, gold, and silver in many different places. On An&#x27;s birthday, 20 February 751, Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Yang awarded him with clothing, treasures, and food. On 23 February, when An was summoned to the palace, Consort Yang, in order to please Emperor Xuanzong, had an extra-large infant wrapping made, and wrapped An in it, causing much explosion of laughter among the ladies-in-waiting and eunuchs. When Emperor Xuanzong asked what was going on, Consort Yang&#x27;s attendants joked that Consort Yang gave birth three days ago and was washing her baby Lushan. Emperor Xuanzong was pleased by the comical situation and rewarded both Consort Yang and An greatly. Thereafter, whenever An visited the capital, he was allowed free admittance to the palace, and there were rumors that he and Consort Yang had an affair, but Emperor Xuanzong discounted the rumors. At An&#x27;s request, Emperor Xuanzong also gave him the governorship of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), in addition to Pinglu and Fanyang. Two of his sons, An Qingzong and An Qingxu, were given ministerial level positions, and An Qingzong was given an imperial clan member&#x27;s daughter, the Lady Rongyi, in marriage.

An was arrogant toward other officials, including Consort Yang&#x27;s second cousin Yang Guozhong. However, carrying the honorary title of deputy chief imperial censor () at this point, he was respectful of his colleague Wang Hong (), an associate of Li Linfu&#x27;s, although initially not Li Linfu—and therefore, on one occasion, Li Linfu intentionally summoned Wang Hong in An&#x27;s presence, and when Wang Hong arrived, he was paying Li Linfu great respect, causing An to be surprised and apprehensive, and thereafter An carefully cultivated his relationship with Li Linfu as well.

===Pondering Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s death &amp; Northward campaign===

It was also said that, by this point, An began to be apprehensive of what would happen once Emperor Xuanzong died—as he remembered how he had refused to bow to Li Heng—and he began to plan an eventual rebellion, which was further encouraged by his observation that the heart of the empire was without defenses. He selected some 8,000 soldiers among the surrendered Khitan, Xi, and Tongluo () tribesmen, organizing them into an elite corps known as the &quot;Yeluohe&quot; (), which meant &quot;the brave&quot;. He retained Gao Shang (), Yan Zhuang (), Zhang Tongru (), and Sun Xiaozhe () as his strategists; and Shi Siming, An Shouzhong (), Li Guiren (), Cai Xide (), Niu Tingjie (), Xiang Runrong (), Li Tingwang (), Cui Qianyou (), Yin Ziqi (), He Qiannian (), Wu Lingxun (), Neng Yuanhao (), Tian Chengsi, Tian Qianzhen (), and Ashina Chengqing () as his generals.

Late in 751, An launched a major attack against the Khitan, advancing quickly to the heart of Khitan territory, but, hampered by rains, was defeated by the Khitan, and the general He Side () was killed. An himself was almost killed, and, after retreating, blamed the defeat on Ge Jie () and Yu Chengxian (), executing them. He subsequently had Shi defend against the Khitan counterattack, and Shi was able to repel the Khitan. In 752, he wanted to launch a major counterattack against the Khitan, requesting that the ethnically Tujue general Li Xianzhong () accompany him. Li Xianzhong was afraid of An; when An ordered Li to attack the Khitan, Li rebelled, thus putting a halt to An&#x27;s campaign.

===Rivalry with Geshu Han===
Later that year, when Emperor Xuanzong, seeing that both An Lushan and An Sishun (who by this point was the military governor of Shuofang Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia)) had poor relations with Geshu Han, the military governor of Hexi (河西, headquartered in modern Wuwei, Gansu) and Longxi (隴西, headquartered in modern Haidong prefecture, Qinghai) Circuits, and wanted to improve relations between these three key border troop commanders, he summoned all three to the capital and had the powerful eunuch Gao Lishi host a feast for the three of them, trying to get them to resolve their unpleasantries. At the conference, however, Geshu and An Lushan got into an argument, which only stopped after Gao gazed at Geshu, stopping him from responding to An Lushan&#x27;s insults.

===Death of Li Linfu and rivalry with Yang Guozhong===
In 753, with Li Linfu&#x27;s death and replacement by Yang Guozhong, Yang Guozhong, intending to posthumously dishonor Li Linfu, had An Lushan corroborate his accusations that Li Linfu was involved in Li Xianzhong&#x27;s rebellion. An agreed, and subsequently, with further corroboration from Li Linfu&#x27;s son-in-law Yang Qixuan (), Li Linfu was posthumously dishonored, and his family members were exiled. Also in 753, Li Xianzhong&#x27;s troops were defeated by the Uyghur Khaganate, and they surrendered to An, further enhancing his strength.

Despite their cooperation posthumously accusing Li Linfu, a rivalry soon developed between An and Yang Guozhong, as An did not fear Yang Guozhong the way he did Li Linfu. Yang Guozhong made repeated accusations against An to Emperor Xuanzong that he was plotting a rebellion, but Emperor Xuanzong dismissed the accusations. Yang Guozhong, instead, allied with Geshu against An. In spring 754, Yang asserted to the Emperor that An was set on rebelling, an accusation Yang had made before. Yang predicted that if Emperor Xuanzong summoned An to Chang&#x27;an, he would surely not come. However, when Emperor Xuanzong tested Yang&#x27;s hypothesis by summoning An, he immediately appeared in Chang&#x27;an and claimed Yang was making false accusations. After that, Emperor Xuanzong refused to believe any suggestions that An was plotting rebellion despite Li Heng agreeing with Yang&#x27;s assessment on this issue. The Emperor even considered promoting An to be chancellor; however, Yang opposed this, and the promotion did not occur. An returned to Fanyang. At An&#x27;s request, Emperor Xuanzong allowed him to award his soldiers high ranks without first receiving imperial approval. (Geshu, hearing this, made the same request, and Emperor Xuanzong granted this privilege to Geshu.) Later, in 754, An defeated Xi forces, capturing their chieftain Li Riyue (). Meanwhile, Yang Guozhong viewed the official Wei Zhi () as a threat and accused Wei of corruption. Yang Guozhong later accused Wei of bribing An&#x27;s associate Ji Wen (), and Wei and Ji were both demoted. An submitted a petition on their behalf, claiming that the accusations from Yang Guozhong were false. Emperor Xuanzong took no actions against either An or Yang Guozhong.

==Rebellion==

The An Lushan Rebellion spanned from 16 December 755 to 17 February 763. This rebellion appears to have involved the death of some 13 million people, which would make it one of the deadliest wars in history. Many scholars attribute the loss of 36 million people in the Tang census after the rebellion to a breakdown in Tang taxation and census gathering.

===Initial stage===
In the spring of 755, matters were coming to a head. An Lushan submitted a petition to Emperor Xuanzong to replace 32 Han generals under his command with non-Han generals. Xuanzong accepted An&#x27;s request despite opposition from chancellors Yang Guozhong and Wei Jiansu, who took An&#x27;s request as a sign of impending rebellion. Yang and Wei then suggested that An be promoted chancellor, and that his three commands be divided between his three deputies.
Emperor Xuanzong initially agreed, but after the edict was drafted, Xuanzong delayed and instead sent the eunuch Fu Qiulin () to send fresh fruits to An and to observe him—upon which An was alleged to bribe Fu into submitting a favorable report. Yang, however, persisted in his reports against An. Yang then attacked some of An&#x27;s staff and associates, including having the mayor of Jingzhao arrest An&#x27;s friend Li Chao () and others, and executing them secretly. An Qingzong, who was then at Chang&#x27;an, reported Yang&#x27;s attack to An Lushan, causing considerable concern to An Lushan, who, thereafter, refused to attend the funeral of an imperial prince in summer 755, and did not offer to send a large number of horses to Chang&#x27;an that autumn, which aroused the suspicions of Emperor Xuanzong. Allegations of An&#x27;s bribes to Fu also reached the Emperor, who then had Fu executed, and sent another eunuch, Feng Shenwei () to Fanyang to again summon An Lushan, who ignored the summons.

In winter 755, An launched his rebellion on 16 December, claiming he had received a secret edict from Emperor Xuanzong to advance on Chang&#x27;an to remove Yang. The imperial officials were all apprehensive, because An had the strongest troops of the realm at the time, except for Yang, who believed that An could be suppressed easily. Emperor Xuanzong commissioned the general Feng Changqing as military governor of Fanyang and Pinglu, intending to have him replace An after An&#x27;s rebellion was defeated. The Emperor also sent Feng to the eastern capital, Luoyang, to build up the defense there; another general, Gao Xianzhi, was ordered to command a secondary defense at Shan Commandery (陝郡, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan). He executed An Qingzong and An&#x27;s first wife Lady Kang, and forced An Qingzong&#x27;s present wife, Lady Rongyi, to take her own life.

On 8 January 756, An Lushan crossed the Yellow River, quickly capturing Chenliu (陳留, roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan) and Yingyang (滎陽, roughly modern Zhengzhou, Henan) Commanderies. He approached Luoyang, where he encountered an ill-prepared army commanded by Feng, defeating Feng quickly and forcing Feng to flee and concede Luoyang to him. Feng joined forces with Gao and urged a retreat to Tong Pass; Gao agreed, and they took up defensive positions there, and An did not proceed quickly, but remained at Luoyang, planning to declare himself emperor there. (Soon, due to accusations of the eunuch Bian Lingcheng (), Emperor Xuanzong executed Feng and Gao, and replaced Gao with Geshu Han.) Some Tang officials north of the Yellow River resisted An Lushan under the leadership of Yan Zhenqing, the governor of Pingyuan Commandery (平原, roughly modern Dezhou, Shandong).

===As emperor of Yan===
On Lunar New Year&#x27;s day, 756 (5 February), An Lushan declared himself Emperor at Luoyang, establishing a new state of Yan, making Zhang Tongru and the surrendered Tang official Daxi Xun () his chancellors. He created An Qingxu the Prince of Jin and another son, An Qinghe (), the Prince of Zheng. Meanwhile, Yan Zhenqing&#x27;s cousin Yan Gaoqing (), who initially submitted to An, rose against An at Changshan Commandery (常山, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei) but was quickly defeated and delivered to An in Luoyang; An executed him and sent An Qingxu to make an initial attack against Tong Pass, and Geshu Han repelled the attack.

By this time, the Tang generals Guo Ziyi and Li Guangbi had fought their way into Emperor An&#x27;s territory north of the Yellow River, cutting off the communication between Luoyang and Fanyang, causing much fear in An&#x27;s troops. An considered withdrawing north of the Yellow River to secure the territory, but meanwhile, suspicions had begun to rise between Yang Guozhong and Geshu, each believing that the other had designs on himself. Yang therefore persuaded Emperor Xuanzong to order Geshu to attack the Yan general Cui Qianyou, who was then stationed at Shan Commandery. (This order was against the advice of Geshu, Guo, and Li Guangbi that the proper strategy was to secure Tong Pass and let Guo and Li Guangbi capture the Yan territory to the north.) Geshu, with Emperor Xuanzong repeatedly ordering him to attack, was forced to do so, and was defeated by Cui. Geshu&#x27;s subordinate Huoba Guiren () seized him and surrendered to Yan forces. Subsequently, An induced Geshu to write letters to several Tang generals, urging them to surrender, but they all refused.

When Yan forces captured Tong Pass, Emperor Xuanzong and Yang, in panic, abandoned Chang&#x27;an and fled toward Shu Commandery (蜀郡, roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan). On the way, at a small village, Mawei Station, prompted by general Chen Xuanli who believed that Yang Guozhong had provoked this rebellion, the imperial guards assassinated Yang Guozhong, and demanded the death of Yang Guifei, to which the Emperor reluctantly consented. An, caught by surprise of the Emperor&#x27;s retreat, had Cui advance slowly into Chang&#x27;an, even though the Tang mayor of Chang&#x27;an, Cui Guangyuan (), offered to surrender. Also surrendering to Yan forces were the former chancellor Chen Xilie and the key officials Zhang Jun () and Zhang Ji (), and An made Chen and Zhang Ji chancellors as well.

Meanwhile, An had Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s sister, Princess of Huo, as well as a number of other imperial relatives, executed, and sacrificed their organs to An Qingzong. At this point, there was a new Tang Emperor: Li Heng, or Emperor Suzong. Due to the slowness of the Yan advance, the Yan forces were unable to capture either Emperor Xuanzong, who eventually reached Shu Commandery, or Li Heng, who fled to Lingwu and took the Tang imperial title there (as Emperor Suzong). (Xuanzong recognized Li Heng&#x27;s actions and subsequently took the title &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; (&quot;retired emperor&quot;).) Hearing news of Chang&#x27;an&#x27;s fall, Guo and Li Guangbi withdrew to Lingwu, allowing Shi to again pacify the region north of the Yellow River and east of the Taihang Mountains with exception of pockets held by Yan Zhenqing and other Tang officials under his command.

===Death===
Once he had assumed the imperial title, An Lushan spent most of his time inside the Luoyang palace. His generals rarely saw him, and most important matters were handled through Yan Zhuang (嚴莊).

An Lushan suffered from chronic eye problems that eventually led to blindness; he had ulcers; and he
was extremely obese. His sheer weight once crushed to death a horse and he needed three servants to help him to put on and take off his clothes when he visited Huaqing Pool.

An Lushan had a highly-trusted Khitan eunuch named Li Zhu&#x27;er (). But in his sickness and blindness An became ill-tempered and paranoid, and would flog or even murder his servants if they had caused him any displeasure. Even Yan Zhuang and Li Zhu&#x27;er were said to be hit frequently.

An Lushan favored his son An Qing&#x27;en () (the son of his second wife, Lady Duan) and was considering appointing An Qing&#x27;en to be crown prince (instead of An Qingxu, who otherwise was in line to receive that title). Knowing that he was out of favor, and fearing that An Lushan was planning to kill him, An Qingxu, along with He, Yan, and Li Zhu&#x27;er, decided to assassinate An Lushan.

On the night of 29 January 757, with Yan and An Qingxu watching outside, Li Zhu&#x27;er took a sword into the palace and attacked An Lushan. An tried to fight back, but could not locate a sword that he had put under his bed. Li Zhu&#x27;er attacked his stomach and abdomen. As his intestines were coming out of his body, An screamed &quot;this is a thief of my own household&quot; and died.

The next morning, Yan announced to the Yan officials that An Lushan was seriously ill, and that he had appointed An Qingxu crown prince. Then, after taking the throne, An Qingxu reported that An Lushan had died.

Two years later, in 759, after Shi Siming killed An Qingxu and assumed the imperial title, Shi Siming buried An Lushan with the ceremony due an imperial prince, not an emperor, and gave him the rather unflattering posthumous name of La (剌, meaning &quot;unthinking&quot;).

<text>First Meetings (2002) is a collection of science fiction short stories by American writer Orson Scott Card, belonging to his &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; series. Tor Books republished the book in 2003 under the titles &quot;First Meetings in the Enderverse&quot; and &quot;First Meetings in Ender&#x27;s Universe&quot; and included the more recent &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pest&quot;, a story about the first meeting of Ender&#x27;s parents.

== Story list ==
The stories in this book are:

* &quot;The Polish Boy&quot; (2002) – Tells the story of how Jan Paweł Wieczorek (Ender&#x27;s father) as a small child gets tested by the International Fleet and convinces them to get his family out of Poland.
* &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pest&quot; (2003) (Not present in 2002 version of book) – Tells the story of how John Paul Wiggin (Ender&#x27;s father) meets and falls in love with his future wife.
* &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; (1977) – First appeared in the August 1977 issue of &quot;Analog&quot; magazine and was later expanded into the novel &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;. Although the foundation of the &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; series, the short story is not properly part of the &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; universe, as there are many discrepancies in continuity.
* &quot;Investment Counselor&quot; (1999) – Tells the story of how Ender Wiggin first met the artificial intelligence Jane and became a speaker for the dead. It first appeared in the anthology &quot;Far Horizons&quot; edited by Robert Silverberg.

==Plot summaries==

===The Polish Boy===
Polish: Jan Paweł Wieczorek (John Paul Wiggin) is a very smart child who is being homeschooled because his family refused to comply with the population&#x27;s control laws. One day, Captain Helena Rudolf from the International Fleet shows up to test three of John Paul&#x27;s brothers for possible admission into Battle School. She notices John Paul reading a book and decides to test him early. He passes the test and gets a very high score for leadership. The IF tries to get him to go to Battle School, but John Paul is only interested in trying to get his family out of Poland so that they can have a better life and he can get a good education. Captain Graff realizes this, but agrees to send the Wieczorek family to America because he hopes that one of John Paul&#x27;s children will go to Battle School.

This story contains younger versions of important characters in the Enderverse, such as Ender&#x27;s father John Paul Wieczorek (later Wiggin), Hyrum Graff, and Admiral Chamrajnagar. Other characters associated with the IF appear, including Captain Helena Rudolf and Colonel Sillian.

=== Teacher&#x27;s Pest ===
While going to college, John Paul is assigned to take a Human Communities class being taught by Theresa Brown. First being annoyed at having to take a class being taught by a graduate student, John Paul soon changes his mind as Theresa Brown leads the class through a provocative debate about communities, war, and population laws. Unfortunately, she has just been told that her research project is being taken away from her in an effort to get her father Admiral Brown to come out of retirement. As a result, she does not want to speak to anyone. Determined, John Paul waits outside her office and orders food for her while she talks to her father on the phone. When she finally comes out, he is still waiting for her. She decides to eat with him, and during the meal John Paul tells her about his secret past. As they continue to talk, they both begin to fall in love, even as they realize that they were both set up by the government to do so.

=== Ender&#x27;s Game (short story) ===

This story begins as Ender is made the commander of Dragon Army at Battle School, an institution designed to make young children into military commanders against an unspecified enemy. Armies are groups of students that fight mock battles in the Battle Room, a null gravity environment, and are subdivided into &quot;toons&quot;. Due to Ender&#x27;s genius in leadership, Dragon Army dominates the competition. After his nineteenth consecutive victory, Ender is told that his Army is being broken up and his toon leaders made commanders in their turn, while he is transferred to Command School for the next stage of his education. Here, veteran Mazer Rackham tutors him in the use of a space battle simulator. Eventually, many of his former toon leaders serve under him once more. Once familiar with the simulator, they fight a series of what Mazer tells them are mock battles against a computer-controlled enemy. Ender&#x27;s team wins again and again, finally destroying a planet that the enemy fleet seems to be protecting. Once the battle is over, Mazer tells Ender that all of the battles were real, the children&#x27;s commands having been relayed to the extant fleet, and that he has destroyed the enemy&#x27;s home world and ended the war.

=== Investment Counselor===

Source:

Ever since the events of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, Ender Wiggin has been voyaging through space at near-lightspeed. When he arrives at the planet Sorelledolce, he has just turned twenty in relativistic time, so he has to file his first tax return on the trust fund which had been given to him by the International Fleet at the end of the Third Bugger War. He shows his list of investments to Benedetto, a tax collector in the starport, who immediately plans to steal some of it. Meanwhile, Andrew receives an email offering him financial software, which has an interactive personality that calls itself Jane.

While they are on Sorelledolce, Andrew&#x27;s sister Valentine Wiggin takes him to a &quot;speaking&quot; for a dead man. Andrew talks to the speaker and discovered that the man learned how to be a speaker for the dead from reading Ender&#x27;s own books &quot;The Hive Queen&quot; and &quot;The Hegemon&quot;.

Andrew decides to accept the assistance of the Jane program. She prepares his tax forms, showing him ways to minimize what he owes. The amount is much less than he had expected. When Andrew delivers the forms to Benedetto, the tax collector tries to blackmail him because he has discovered Ender&#x27;s identity as the hated Xenocide. But Benedetto finds that his files have mysteriously disappeared, and the evidence trail is now behind Fleet security. In an attempt to get revenge against Ender, he tries to leak what data he still has to the media, but Jane appears on his screen and gives him a choice: &quot;Either say nothing, or tell the whole truth.&quot; Benedetto rejects the first option, but when the media receives his story, it has been mysteriously integrated with a full confession of his embezzlements.

Benedetto is arrested, his claims against Andrew are assumed to be falsehoods, and while he is in prison one of his more powerful victims has him killed. Andrew does a speaking at Benedetto&#x27;s funeral. He has thus inadvertently given himself a career, that of &quot;speaker for the dead.&quot;

<text>OPS5 is a rule-based or production system computer language, notable as the first such language to be used in a successful expert system, the R1/XCON system used to configure VAX computers.

The OPS (said to be short for &quot;Official Production System&quot;) family was developed in the late 1970s by Charles Forgy while at Carnegie Mellon University. Allen Newell&#x27;s research group in artificial intelligence had been working on production systems for some time, but Forgy&#x27;s implementation, based on his Rete algorithm, was especially efficient, sufficiently so that it was possible to scale up to larger problems involving hundreds or thousands of rules.

OPS5 uses a forward chaining inference engine; programs execute by scanning &quot;working memory elements&quot; (which are vaguely object-like, with classes and attributes) looking for matches with the rules in &quot;production memory&quot;. Rules have actions that may modify or remove the matched element, create new ones, perform side effects such as output, and so forth. Execution continues until no more matches can be found.

In this sense, OPS5 is an execution engine for a Petri net extended with inhibitor arcs.

The OPS5 forward chaining process makes it extremely parallelizeable during the matching phase, and several automatic parallelizing compilers were created.

OPS4 was an early version, while OPS83 came later.

The first implementation of OPS5 was written in Lisp, and later rewritten in BLISS for speed.

DEC OPS5 is an extended implementation of the OPS5 language definition, developed for use with the OpenVMS, RISC ULTRIX, and DEC OSF/1 operating systems.

<doc id="475830" wikidata="Q276090" url="?curid=475830" title="Elizebeth Smith Friedman">
<text>Elizebeth Smith Friedman (August 26, 1892 – October 31, 1980) was an American cryptanalyst and author who deciphered enemy codes in both World Wars and helped to solve international smuggling cases during Prohibition. Over the course of her career, she worked for the United States Treasury, Coast Guard, Navy and Army, and the International Monetary Fund. She has been called &quot;America&#x27;s first female cryptanalyst&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Friedman was born in Huntington, Indiana, to John Marion Smith, a Quaker dairyman, banker, and politician, and Sophia Smith (née Strock). Friedman was the youngest of nine surviving children (a tenth died in infancy) and was raised on a farm.

From 1911 to 1913, Friedman attended Wooster College in Ohio, but left when her mother became ill. In 1913, Friedman transferred to Hillsdale College in Michigan, as it was closer to home. In 1915, she graduated with a major in English literature. She was a member of Pi Beta Phi. Having exhibited her interest in languages, she had also studied Latin, Greek, and German, and minored &quot;in a great many other things.&quot; Only she and one other sibling attended college. In 1938, Hillsdale awarded her an honorary doctor of laws degree. 

In the fall of 1915, Friedman became the substitute principal of a public high school in Wabash, Indiana. The position was short-lived, however, and in the spring of 1916, she quit and moved back in with her parents.

== Career ==

=== Riverbank Laboratories and World War I ===

Elizebeth Smith began working at Riverbank Laboratories in Geneva, Illinois, in 1916. It was one of the first facilities in the U.S. established to study cryptography. Colonel George Fabyan, a wealthy textile merchant, owned Riverbank Laboratories and was interested in Shakespeare. Friedman was looking for a job and visited Chicago&#x27;s Newberry Library, where she talked to a librarian who knew of Fabyan&#x27;s interest. The librarian called Fabyan, who appeared in his limousine and invited Elizebeth to spend a night at Riverbank, where they discussed what life would be like at Fabyan&#x27;s great estate located in Geneva, Illinois. He told her that she would assist a Boston woman, Elizabeth Wells Gallup, and her sister with Gallup&#x27;s attempt to prove Sir Francis Bacon had written Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and sonnets. The work would involve decrypting enciphered messages that were supposed to have been contained within the plays and poems.

On the staff at Riverbank was the man Elizebeth would marry in May 1917, William F. Friedman, a plant biologist who also became involved in the Bacon-Shakespeare project.

Riverbank gathered historical information on secret writing. Military cryptography had been deemphasized after the Civil War to the point that there were only three or four people in the United States who knew anything about the subject. Two of those people were Elizebeth and William Friedman. When the United States entered World War I, Fabyan established a new Riverbank Department of Ciphers, with the Friedmans in charge, and offered their services to the government. During the war, the Friedmans developed many of the principles of modern cryptology. Several U.S. government departments asked Riverbank Labs for help or sent personnel there for training. Among those was Agnes Meyer Driscoll, who came on behalf of the U.S. Navy.

The Friedmans worked together for the next four years in what was the only cryptographic facility in the country, until Herbert Yardley&#x27;s so-called &quot;Black Chamber&quot; was established as MI8, the Army&#x27;s Cipher Bureau, in 1919. In 1921, the Friedmans left Riverbank to work for the War Department in Washington, D.C. Their previous efforts to leave had been thwarted by Fabyan, who intercepted their mail.

=== Prohibition ===
The 1919 National Prohibition Act, also known as the Volstead Act, forbade the manufacture, sale, or trade of liquor in the United States. However, Prohibition, which was in effect from 1920 to 1933, did not stop the demand for alcoholic beverages, and the Coast Guard was put in charge of stopping smugglers along the coasts. Bootleggers and smugglers brought liquor and narcotics into the U.S., as well as items that would be heavily taxed if imported openly, such as perfume, jewels, and even pinto beans.

The smugglers used encrypted Morse code radio messages extensively to conduct their operations. In response, the Coast Guard hired Elizebeth Friedman, who had quit her job in 1922, on a temporary basis to decode their backlog of messages. Eventually, she and a small team of cryptanalysts she trained led the effort against international smuggling and drug-running. 

While early codes and ciphers were very basic, their subsequent increase in complexity and resistance to solution was important to the financial growth of smuggling operations. The extent of sophistication posed little problem for Friedman; she mounted successful attacks against simple substitution and transposition ciphers, as well as the more complex ciphers which eventually came into use.

In 1927, the U.S. Treasury Department&#x27;s Bureau of Prohibition and of Customs established a joint effort with the U.S. Coast Guard Intelligence Division to monitor international smuggling, drug-running, and criminal activity domestically and internationally. From 1927 to 1939, the unit, which was of critical importance, was folded into the U.S. Coast Guard.

Friedman solved the bulk of intercepts collected by Coast Guard stations in San Francisco and Florida herself. In June 1928, she was sent to teach C.A. Housel, stationed with the Coordinator of the Pacific Coast Details, how to decrypt rumrunners&#x27; messages. Under her teaching, Housel was able to decode 3,300 messages within 21 months. In October and November 1929, she was then recruited in Houston, Texas, to solve 650 smuggling traffic cases that had been subpoenaed by the United States Attorney. In doing so, she decrypted 24 coding systems used by smugglers. Friedman&#x27;s work was responsible for providing decoded information that resulted in the conviction of the narcotics-smuggling Ezra Brothers.

While working for the U.S. Coast Guard, the Bureau of Narcotics, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Bureau of Prohibition and Customs, and the Department of Justice, Friedman solved over 12,000 coded messages by hand in three years, resulting in 650 criminal prosecutions. One of the individuals Friedman helped to indict was Al Capone.

In 1930, Friedman proposed creating a team of seven people to handle the increasing workload involved in decrypting messages. Her proposal was finally approved in 1931, and she was put in charge of the only codebreaking unit in America ever to be managed by a woman. She recruited and trained the analysts, and by the end of 1932, had developed the best radio intelligence team in the country. This allowed her to address new, atypical systems as they appeared and expedited the entire process from initial analysis through to solution. It also allowed her to stay one step ahead of the smugglers. &quot;Our office doesn&#x27;t make &#x27;em, we only break &#x27;em,&quot; said Friedman to a visitor who tried to sell her code-making assistance. The NSA notes that she did &quot;break &#x27;em&quot; many times over a variety of targets. Her successes led to the conviction of many violators of the Volstead Act.

In addition to her cryptanalytic successes, she often testified in cases against accused parties. She appeared as an expert witness in 33 cases and became famous as a result of newspaper and magazine articles about her. The messages she deciphered enabled her to implicate several smugglers in the Gulf of Mexico and on the Pacific Coast. She testified in cases in Galveston and Houston in Texas. In 1933 she was a star witness at the New Orleans, Louisiana, trial of 23 suspected agents of the Consolidated Exporters Corporation. Her testimony resulted in the convictions of five of the ringleaders, who were directly linked with smuggling vessels as a result of her analysis.

The next year she helped settle a dispute between the Canadian and U.S. governments over the true ownership of the sailing vessel &quot;I&#x27;m Alone&quot;. The vessel was flying the Canadian flag when it was sunk by for failing to heed a &quot;heave to and be searched&quot; signal. The Canadian government filed a $350,000 suit against the U.S., but the intelligence gleaned from the twenty-three messages decoded by Friedman indicated &quot;de facto&quot; U.S. ownership just as the U.S. had originally suspected. The true owners of the ship were identified and most of the Canadian claim was dismissed.

The Canadian government sought Friedman&#x27;s help in 1937 with an opium-smuggling gang, and she eventually testified in the trial of Gordon Lim and several other Chinese. Her solution to a complicated unknown Chinese enciphered code, in spite of her unfamiliarity with the language, was key to the successful convictions.

===World War II===
During World , Friedman&#x27;s Coast Guard unit was transferred to the Navy, where they were the principal U.S. source of intelligence on Operation Bolívar, the clandestine German network in South America. Prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the U.S. into the war, there was concern that Germany could eventually attack the U.S. via Latin America. The Nazi authorities also saw Latin America as a potential opportunity to outflank the U.S. While the FBI was given responsibility for countering this threat, at the time, the one U.S. agency with staff experienced in detecting and monitoring clandestine spy transmissions was the Coast Guard, due to its earlier work against smugglers, and Friedman’s team was its sole cryptoanalytic asset.

Friedman’s team remained the primary U.S. code-breakers assigned to the South American threat, and they solved numerous cipher systems used by the Germans and their local sympathizers, including three separate Enigma machines. According to cables between Britain&#x27;s Bletchley Park and Washington, D.C. at the time, the two organizations exchanged solutions. The Bletchley Park section that solved the spy Enigmas was known as ISK, Intelligence Service Knox, and the American section was the Friedman&#x27;s Coast Guard Cryptanalytic Unit 387. The two sections worked independently and ended up solving the machines around the same time. One turned out to be an unrelated Swiss network, but the other two were used by Johannes Siegfried Becker (codename: ’’Sargo’’), the SS agent who headed the operation, to communicate with Germany. Regarding Becker, biographer Jason Fagone states: “Elizebeth was his nemesis. She successfully tracked him where every other law enforcement agency and intelligence agencies failed. She did what the FBI could not do.” After the spy ring was broken, Argentina, Bolivia and Chile broke with the Axis powers and supported the Allies.

Over the course of the war, Friedman’s team decoded 4,000 messages sent on 48 different radio circuits. The work of Friedman&#x27;s Unit 387 (Coast Guard Cryptanalytic Unit) was often in support of the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover, and was not always credited. In fact, Friedman was irritated by the &quot;sloppiness&quot; of the FBI, for example in rounding up spies in South America, thus alerting the Nazis that their codes had been broken. At the end of World War II, Hoover began a public media campaign claiming that the FBI led the code-breaking effort that resulted in the collapse and arrest of the German spy network in South America. This effort included a story in &quot;The American Magazine&quot; titled &quot;How the Nazi Spy Invasion Was Smashed&quot; and a publicity film called &quot;The Battle of the United States.&quot; Neither mentioned Friedman or the Coast Guard.

In 1944, Friedman helped convict Velvalee Dickinson for having attempted to send information to Japan. Known as the &quot;Doll Woman,&quot; her antique doll shop was her cover as she corresponded with Japanese agents using the names of women from her business correspondence. Her messages contained encoded material addressing naval vessel status in Pearl Harbor. The messages were decoded by Friedman and helped convict Dickinson.

After World , Friedman became a consultant to the International Monetary Fund and created communications security systems for them based on one-time tapes.

=== Retirement ===
After retirement from government service, Friedman and her husband, who had long been Shakespeare enthusiasts, collaborated on a manuscript, &quot;The Cryptologist Looks at Shakespeare&quot;, eventually published as &quot;The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined.&quot; It won awards from the Folger Shakespeare Library and the American Shakespeare Theatre and Academy. In this book, the Friedmans dismissed Baconians such as Gallup and Ignatius Donnelly with such technical proficiency and finesse that the book won far more acclaim than did others that addressed the same topic.

The work that Gallup had done earlier for Col. Fabyan at Riverbank operated on the assumption that Bacon wrote Shakespeare and used the bi-literal cipher he invented in the original printed Shakespeare folios, employing &quot;an odd variety of typefaces.&quot; The Friedmans, however, &quot;in a classic demonstration of their life&#x27;s work,&quot; buried a hidden Baconian cipher on a page in their publication. It was an italicized phrase which, using the different type faces, expressed their final assessment of the controversy: &quot;I did not write the plays. F. Bacon.&quot; Their book is regarded as the definitive work, if not the final word, on the subject. Ironically, it was the Riverbank effort to prove Bacon wrote Shakespeare that introduced the Friedmans to cryptology.

Following her husband&#x27;s death in 1969, Friedman devoted much of her retirement life to compiling a library and bibliography of his work. This &quot;most extensive private collection of cryptographic material in the world&quot; was donated to the George C. Marshall Research Library in Lexington, Virginia. In 1971, she donated her own papers, which are now known as The Elizebeth Smith Friedman Collection at the Marshall Foundation.

Friedman belonged to civic organizations such as the League of Women Voters and worked on behalf of statehood for the District of Columbia. She was also a respected public speaker.

== Personal life ==
The rare spelling of her name (it is more commonly spelled &quot;Elizabeth&quot;) is attributed to her mother, who disliked the prospect of Elizebeth ever being called &quot;Eliza.&quot;

In 1917, Friedman married William F. Friedman, who later became a cryptographer credited with numerous contributions to cryptology, a field to which she introduced him.

They had two children, Barbara Friedman Atchison (1923-2021), and John Ramsay Friedman (1926–2010).

In the 1930s, William Friedman began to show signs of the depression that afflicted him for the rest of his life. Elizebeth supported him and began covering up for him. In January 1941 he was admitted to the Neuropsychiatric Section at Walter Reed General Hospital in Washington, DC, where he spent two and a half months in a mental ward. His condition was deemed to be anxiety due to overwork on a top secret project. After the war, Elizebeth spent more and more of her time taking care of her husband. In April 1955, he suffered his first heart attack. His health continued to worsen, and he died on November 2, 1969.

Elizebeth Friedman died on October 31, 1980, in the Abbott Manor Nursing Home in Plainfield, New Jersey, at the age of 88. She was cremated and her ashes spread over her husband&#x27;s grave at Arlington National Cemetery.

== Posthumous recognition ==

Friedman&#x27;s contributions received increasing recognition after her death. Friedman had signed an oath with the U.S. Navy promising to keep her role in World War II secret until her death, and she did so. It was not until 2008 that the documents were finally declassified.

* In 1999, the year of its creation, she was inducted to the NSA Hall of Honor.

* The NSA auditorium, which had been named after William in 1975, was renamed in 1999 the &quot;William and Elizebeth Friedman Auditorium.&quot;

* In 2002 NSA&#x27;s OPS1 building was dedicated as the William and Elizebeth Friedman Building during the Agency&#x27;s 50th Anniversary Commemoration.

* On June 17, 2014, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms named its national headquarters auditorium after Elizebeth Smith Friedman. 

* In 2017, after spending three years researching information about the Friedmans in their personal papers and declassified U.S. and British government files, Jason Fagone published a biography entitled &quot;The Woman Who Smashed Codes: A True Story of Love, Spies, and the Unlikely Heroine who Outwitted America’s Enemies&quot;.

* In April 2019, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution &quot;Honoring the life and legacy of Elizebeth Smith Friedman, Cryptanalyst&quot;.

* On July 7, 2020, the U.S. Coast Guard announced that it was naming the 11th Legend-Class National Security Cutter (NSC) in honor of Elizebeth Smith Friedman. According to the announcement, &quot;Legend-Class cutters honor women and men who have a legendary status in the Coast Guard&#x27;s rich history.&quot; Construction began in May 2021 of the .

* &quot;The Codebreaker,&quot; an episode of the television documentary series &quot;American Experience&quot; about Elizebeth Smith Friedman&#x27;s life, based on Fagone&#x27;s biography plus archival letters and photographs, premiered on January 11, 2021.

* In October 2021, Amy Butler Greenfield published her biography &quot;The Woman All Spies Fear: Code Breaker Elizebeth Smith Friedman and Her Hidden Life&quot;.

<text>Renaud Pierre Manuel Séchan (; born 11 May 1952 in Paris), known as Renaud, is a French singer-songwriter.

With twenty-six albums to his credit, selling nearly twenty million copies, he is one of France&#x27;s most popular singers. Several of his songs are popular classics in France, including the sea tale &quot;Dès que le vent soufflera&quot;, the irreverent &quot;Laisse béton&quot;, the ballad &quot;Morgane de toi&quot; and the nostalgic &quot;Mistral gagnant&quot;. His songs, with their slang lyrics and idiosyncratic Parisian phrasing, deal with both light and serious themes, alternating humor, emotion, and social criticism. 

Although he enjoyed great success in France in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, his career took a roller-coaster ride thereafter, with the singer regularly falling victim to depression and alcoholism, ailments he recounts in various songs. His work remains little known outside the French-speaking world.

He also appeared in several films, including Claude Berri&#x27;s adaptation of Germinal in 1993.

Although his political stance has provoked controversy, he has nicknamed himself &quot;le chanteur énervant&quot; (the irritating singer), due to his many commitments to causes such as human rights, ecology, and anti-militarism, which are frequently reflected in his songs.

==Career==
===Early work===
Fresh out of school, Renaud was determined to become an actor. By chance he met the actor Patrick Dewaere and was invited to join the company of the comedy theatre Café de la Gare, which had recently been founded by Patrick Dewaere, Coluche, and Miou-Miou.

His early work is characterized by a volatile temperament, innovative use of French, and edgy, dark, leftist social and political themes. Raised in an educated milieu, the son of an intellectual, Renaud adopted the looks and attitude of working-class youth in the 1970s, and reflected this in his lyrics. A recurrent theme is his disgust for the average French person with petit-bourgeois preoccupations and right-wing leanings (see &quot;beauf&quot;).
His music focuses on the disparity between classes, the abuse of political power, overbearing authority and disgust for the military and the police, with rare glimpses of tenderness for his fellow humans, the planet earth, and art.

===Middle period===
In 1985, in a concert in Moscow, in what was an orchestrated gesture, roughly one third of the spectators upped and left the concert hall when he sang the anti-militarist &quot;Déserteur&quot;. In the late 1980s and the 1990s, Renaud&#x27;s work was distinguished by &quot;softer&quot; subjects such as his then-wife Dominique, his daughter Lolita and his friends, as well as comedian and singer Coluche for whom he wrote the tribute &quot;Putain de camion&quot; (&quot;Bloody Lorry&quot;) after Coluche&#x27;s death in a road accident. He has also ventured into regional music and language, such as the language of Marseille in &quot;La Belle de Mai&quot;, the north with &quot;Renaud cante el&#x27; Nord&quot; and even Corsican polyphonics in &quot;Lolito lolita&quot;.

In 1992, he financially helped resurrect the defunct satirical weekly &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; and wrote a column titled &quot;Renaud bille en tête&quot; for a couple of years. His column appeared again in 1995–1996, retitled &quot;Envoyé spécial chez moi&quot;. In 2006, he published &quot;Les Bobos&quot;, as a satire on the Parisian lower bourgeoisie.

In 1993, he also played the leading part of Étienne Lantier in the film &quot;Germinal&quot; directed by Claude Berri.

===Resurgence===
After an unproductive period marked by alcoholism, he made a significant comeback with his 2002 album &quot;Boucan d&#x27;enfer&quot;. That album&#x27;s hit was &quot;Manhattan-Kaboul&quot;, a duo with Axelle Red which tackled current issues by drawing a parallel between a victim of the 9-11 attacks in New York and an Afghan girl, both caught up in a war they don&#x27;t understand.

In 2009 Renaud released &quot;Molly Malone – Balade irlandaise&quot;, an album of Irish ballads. Produced by ex-Boomtown Rats bassist Pete Briquette, the album was commercially successful (certified double-platinum in just over a month) but the singer&#x27;s feeble, often out-of-tune vocals caused some negative reviews.

In 2014, a collective of 15 artists released a tribute album containing 14 tracks covers of his songs under the title &quot;La Bande à Renaud&quot;.

On 26 January 2016, on his website, Renaud released &quot;Toujours debout&quot;, the first track from his new studio album yet to be released. On the same day, he announced on the French public radio station France Inter the title of his new studio album: &quot;Toujours debout&quot;. The video &quot;Toujours debout&quot; was released on 26 February 2016. On 8 April 2016, Renaud released a studio album, &quot;Toujours debout&quot; but oddly sold under the simple title &quot;Renaud&quot;.

==Personal life==
Renaud was born at 03:30 in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, ten minutes after his brother David. His mother chose the name Renaud because her mother and grandmother would sing &quot;La complainte du Roi Renaud&quot; (The Lament of King Renaud) to her, and she found it so sad that she would cry each time she heard it.

His father Olivier Séchan, born to a Protestant Languedoc family from the Cévennes and Montpellier, was a novelist and children&#x27;s writer. He taught German in a secondary school in Paris. The director Edmond Séchan is his uncle.
His grandfather was the scholar and Hellenist Louis Séchan, who taught at the Sorbonne. His ancestors were pastors. His mother is the daughter of a coalminer from the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. Renaud dedicated part of his work to his familial roots, singing traditional songs in the regional Picard language and playing the part of Étienne Lantier in &quot;Germinal&quot;, a film based on the famous Émile Zola novel.

He is the sixth of eight children born to his father. He has two brothers: David, his fraternal twin, and the writer Thierry Sechan, as well as two sisters. He also has two half-sisters and a half-brother, children of his father and his first wife.

During his childhood, Renaud lived in the 14th arrondissement of Paris with his paternal grandparents in a building reserved for teachers by the RIVP. Among seven people, they shared two rooms. Soon his family was able to move to a large apartment, with his father being a teacher and his grandfather being a celebrated academic.

Between ten and twelve years old, he wrote novels on his father&#x27;s typewriter and discovered Yé-yé and the Beatles.

In August 2005, Renaud married Romane Serda, the mother of his son Malone. In 2007, he announced to the press his intention to move his family to London, citing a love for British society and expressing disillusionment at the current state of France. In 2009 Renaud&#x27;s daughter, writer Lolita Séchan, married French acoustic singer-songwriter Renan Luce.

In September 2011, Romane divorced Renaud on the account of his alcoholism and depression.

<text>The coat of arms of [[Bulgaria]] consists of a crowned golden lion rampant over a dark red shield; above the shield is the Bulgarian historical crown. The shield is supported by two crowned golden lions rampant; below the shield there is compartment in the shape of oak twigs and white bands with the national motto &quot;Unity makes strength&quot; inscribed on them.

==Description==
The current coat of arms of Bulgaria was adopted in 1997. The current arms are a slightly redesigned version of the coat of arms of Bulgaria from the period 1927–1946. Those arms were based on a similar earlier form, firstly used by Tsar Ferdinand I (1887–1918) as his personal ruler&#x27;s coat of arms. The previous emblem, which combined the traditional gold lion rampant with the pattern of the coat of arms of the Soviet Union, was abandoned since Communist rule ended in the country in 1989. The new Constitution of Bulgaria, adopted in 1991, describes the Bulgarian coat of arms as follows:

For many years, agreement on the design of the coat of arms was a source of great controversy in the Bulgarian government, as different parties argued over the design elements. The final design was legitimized in the Law for the coat of arms of the Republic of Bulgaria of 4 August 1997:
==History==


The earliest example of a lion&#x27;s image as the heraldic symbol of Bulgaria is documented in the &quot;Lord Marshal&#x27;s Roll&quot;, composed around 1294 AD and preserved in a copy from about 1640. In its first part under №15 is represented the coat of arms of &quot;Le Rey de Bugrie&quot; or the King of Bulgaria, most probably this of Tsar Smilets (1292–1298) or may be some of his recent predecessors. It consists of an argent lion rampant with golden crown over sable shield. In the end of 14th century an anonymous Arab traveller, who visited the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire Tarnovo, saw and depicted three lions guardant passant gules painted on the round golden shields carried by the personal guards of Tsar Ivan Shishman (1371–1395). His manuscript is now kept in the National Library of Morocco.

After 1396, when all Bulgarian lands were subjugated by the Ottoman Empire but the Bulgarian crown was not given to the Ottoman Dynasty formally, the latter Bulgarian heraldic type as a sign of symbolically independent state was preserved in several European and Balkan collections of coats of arms. Gradually, new and in some cases quite different versions appeared, but the lion remained the most widespread heraldic symbol of Bulgaria and its rulers. In the Illyrian collection of Korenich-Neorich from 1595 the three walking lions, usual for some earlier Western Europe&#x27;s collections, were replaced by one red lion rampant over golden crowned shield. In the beginning of the 18th century the Croatian heraldist Pavao Ritter Vitezović in two editions of his heraldic collection from 1701 and 1702 reversed the colours of this type and thus the lion became golden and the shield dark red.

This variant was adopted by the famous painter Hristofor Zhefarovich in his &quot;Stemmatographia&quot;, printed in 1741. His version became the most influential among Bulgarian intellectuals and revolutionaries in the period of the national awakening of Bulgaria, when the lion was considered and widely used as a major national symbol. After the liberational Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) the coat of arms of Zhefarovich was laid in the base of the new state coat of arms, described in the Tarnovo Constitution of 1879 as follows:

The type and the details regarding the state coat of arms were not described clearly and were not standardized by a special Act. Because of this, for several decades they took different forms: lesser form; lesser form without supporters, compartment and motto, but covered with mantle from 1879 to 1880; greater form with supporters, bearing two national flags, compartment, motto and mantle from 1881 to 1927; middle form with supporters, compartment and motto from 1915 until 1918/20. Besides these there were different variations within these types. This perplexed situation was resolved by a special parliamentary commission, which sat after 1923. In 1927 it legitimated the middle form of the coat of arms, similar to these used as personal coats of arms by Bulgarian monarchs Ferdinand I and his son Tsar Boris III (1918–1943), but excluding all dynastic elements and preserving only the pure state symbolism.

Following 1944, new times began for the Bulgarian heraldry. In the communist era, the traditional type of coat of arms was replaced by an emblem which preserved the golden lion rampant placed over a non-historically-justifiable oval azure field, but encircled by the ears of wheat, folded by banners, a gear-wheel, a five-pointed red star and some other elements. This composition was derived principally from the pattern of the emblem of the Soviet Union. After the breakdown of the Bulgarian socialist republic in 1989 and several years of fierce partisan disputes, the traditional middle coat of arms from the period 1927–1946 was restored in 1991 with some minor changes.

The crown on top of the shield, and thus upon the shielded lion, according to the Coat of Arms of the Republic of Bulgaria Act, is supposed to be not that of the last Bulgarian monarchy (1879–1946), but that of the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185–1396). This empire was established by the brothers Peter and Asen, after it was freed from Byzantine control in the end of the 12th century, and it was subjugated by the Ottomans in the very end of the 14th century. In fact it significantly differs from the crowns known from medieval portraits such as these from the Tetraevangelia of Tsar Ivan Alexander (1331–1371).

There is a very popular belief that the three lions represent the three major portions and historical regions of Bulgaria — Moesia, Thrace and Macedonia, which has no connection with the native historical tradition and the principles of heraldry.

<text>Marayat Rollet-Andriane, formerly Marayat Krasaesin () or her birthname Marayat Bibidh (; ; born 19 January 1932 – 12 June 2005), known by the pen name Emmanuelle Arsan, was a Thai-French novelist, best known for the novel featuring the fictional character Emmanuelle, a woman who sets out on a voyage of sexual self-discovery under varying circumstances. It was later claimed that the real author of the book was her husband, Louis-Jacques Rollet-Andriane.

==Early life==
Arsan was born Marayat Bibidh on 19 January 1932 in Bangkok, Thailand, into an aristocratic Siamese family closely connected to the royal family. Marayat&#x27;s family home was in the affluent Ekkamai District of the Thai capital, where she reportedly discovered her sexuality in the company of her little sister Vasana.

After attending primary school in Thailand, Marayat was sent by her parents to Switzerland to continue her studies at the extremely selective Institut Le Rosey boarding school, located in Rolle, Canton of Vaud. The school offered a bilingual English-French education to the offspring of the international elite. At a ball there in 1948, the 16-year-old Marayat first met her future husband, 30-year-old French diplomat Louis-Jacques Rollet-Andriane. Although it was love at first sight, they did not marry until 1956, then settled in Thailand, where Louis-Jacques was given a diplomatic posting at the UNESCO mission in Bangkok.

Within the selective atmosphere of the Sports Club, Louis-Jacques and Marayat, with their hedonistic philosophy of communal sex, quickly created a sensation among the expatriate interlopers, diplomats, pseudospies, bored spouses, and jet-setters who drifted in and out. As a result, the couple&#x27;s reputation soon spread beyond the restricted circle of the initiated and turned the Thai capital into a popular destination for swingers. At this time, they had their first encounter with the idle Italian Prince Dado Ruspoli, who belonged to the international playboy elite of the 1950s and whose discourse on sex had a profound impact on Marayat and Louis-Jacques. They immediately made Dado their &quot;spiritual guide&quot; and &quot;high priest of love&quot;.

In 1963, Louis-Jacques was posted to Italy, and for five years, the couple resided in both Venice and Rome, where they again met Ruspoli. He introduced them to the high society of transalpine libertinage. From 1968 to 1980, Marayat and her husband often alternated between Paris and Bangkok.

==Literary career==
The novel &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; was initially published and distributed clandestinely in France in 1959, without an author&#x27;s name. Successive editions were ascribed to Emmanuelle Arsan, who was subsequently revealed to be Marayat Rollet-Andriane. Though the novel was sometimes hinted to be quasi-autobiographical, it was later revealed that the actual author was her husband Louis-Jacques Rollet-Andriane. Several more novels were published under the Emmanuelle Arsan pseudonym.

Between 1974 and 1976, Arsan and her husband, in association with Just Jaeckin, published the erotic magazine (&quot;Emmanuelle, the pleasure magazine&quot;) in France, contributing photographs and text.

==Film and TV career==
Following the success of the eponymous 1974 film adaptation of her novel, directed by Just Jaeckin, Arsan was the titular director and scriptwriter of the film &quot;Laure&quot; (1976) about the sexual discoveries of a younger &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; named Laure, again in an exotic setting. The film was in fact directed by Louis-Jacques Rollet-Andriane and Roberto D&#x27;Ettorre Piazzoli, though Rollet-Andriane, reportedly frustrated by problems related to his collaboration with the producer, Ovidio G. Assonitis, asked that Emmanuelle Arsan&#x27;s name not be associated with the project, resulting in the film being credited to an anonymous director.

Using the screen name &quot;Marayat Andriane&quot;, Arsan appeared in the film &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; (1966), and in an episode of the American series &quot;The Big Valley&quot; (&quot;Turn of a Card&quot;, 1967). Although she signed a contract with 20th Century Fox, she never worked as an actress for that company again. Her only other film appearance, credited as Emmanuelle Arsan, was in &quot;Laure&quot;, which was also released under the alternative title &quot;Forever Emmanuelle&quot;.

==Personal life==
Marayat spoke fluent Thai, French, and English. Her hobbies and passions included writing, reading, photography, cinema, and antiques, among others. Louis-Jacques Rollet-Andriane and she had two daughters, Sophie and Danièle. She is known to have had relationships with the French beatnik writer, mime, and photographer Théo Lesouac&#x27;h, and allegedly with the American actor Steve McQueen, during the shooting of &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;, although what really went on between them remains a mystery.

==Later life==
At the beginning of the 1980s, Louis-Jacques and Marayat decided to settle down in France for a much quieter life. An Iranian friend offered the couple a plot of land in the south of the country, near the commune of Callas, in the Var. It was in this woodland domain they constructed their retirement place, &quot;Chantelouve d&#x27;Emmanuelle&quot;, an isolated single-storey house built around a vast patio. Louis-Jacques continued with his writing, happy to correspond with &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; fans under his pen name Emmanuelle Arsan, while Marayat, her dreams of stardom far behind her, was content to grow old gracefully, with the occasional visit to Bangkok. It was at this point that Nitya Phenkun entered their lives. She was an old acquaintance of Louis-Jacques, having been his secretary (and mistress) during his diplomatic posting in Bangkok, and on moving to Chantelouve, she took up her former functions, reportedly forming a threesome with the Rollet-Andriane couple.

==Illness and death==
In 2001, Marayat suddenly fell ill. She was diagnosed with systemic scleroderma, a rare and incurable autoimmune disease, which had first given her trouble at the age of 20. After a period of remission that had lasted for 49 years, the disease returned and attacked her legs, causing her acute suffering and rapidly affecting her mobility. Her health further deteriorated when gangrene rapidly ensued, and both of her legs had to be amputated above the knee. She was, therefore, forced to spend the remaining four years of her life bedridden, being treated at home by a private nurse. Marayat died on 12 June 2005 at Chantelouve, aged 73. Her husband died three years later, in April 2008.
Nitya Phenkun, the sole beneficiary of the copyright of &quot;Emmanuelle&quot;, returned to Thailand soon after Louis-Jacques&#x27; death, and put the Chantelouve estate up for sale.

<doc id="475847" wikidata="Q1269275" url="?curid=475847" title="Herbert Yardley">
<text>Herbert Osborn Yardley (April 13, 1889 – August 7, 1958) was an American cryptologist. He founded and led the cryptographic organization the Black Chamber. Under Yardley, the cryptanalysts of The American Black Chamber broke Japanese diplomatic codes and were able to furnish American negotiators with significant information during the Washington Naval Conference of 1921–1922. Recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal. He wrote &quot;The American Black Chamber&quot; (1931) about his experiences there. He later helped the Nationalists in China (1938–1940) to break Japanese codes. Following his work in China, Yardley worked briefly for the Canadian government, helping it set up a cryptological section (Examination Unit) of the National Research Council of Canada from June to December 1941. Yardley was reportedly let go due to pressure either from the Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson or from the British.

==Early life==
Yardley was born in 1889 in Worthington, Indiana. He learned to use the telegraph from his father, Robert Kirkbride Yardley, a station master and telegrapher for a railroad. His mother, Mary Emma Osborn Yardley, died when he was 13.

After graduation from high school in 1907, Yardley went to the University of Chicago, but dropped out after one year and went back to Worthington, where he worked as a telegrapher for a railroad. He spent his free time learning how to play poker and applied his winnings towards his further schooling. In 1912, after passing the civil service exam, he was hired as a government telegrapher.

Yardley began his career as a code clerk in the U.S. State Department. He accepted a Signal Corps Reserve commission and served as a cryptologic officer with the American Expeditionary Forces in France during World War I.

==Codebreaking==
His career in cryptology began with his work in the code room, as he broke the U.S. government codes that crossed his desk. At that time, American codes were very weak and Yardley solved them easily. He was shocked to learn that President Wilson was using a code that had been in use for over ten years. The weakness of American codes worried Yardley, especially considering the war in Europe, so in May 1916 he began writing a hundred-page &quot;Solution of American Diplomatic Codes&quot;, which he gave to his boss.

Breaking American codes got Yardley wondering about the codes of other countries. American participation in the war gave Yardley an opportunity to convince Major Ralph Van Deman of the need to set up a section to break other countries&#x27; codes. In June 1917, Yardley became a 2nd lieutenant in the Signal Corps and head of the newly created eighth section of military intelligence, MI-8. One early case was the cryptogram discovered in the clothing of German spy Lothar Witzke after he was arrested at the Mexican border in 1918. The evidence linked Witzke to significant sabotage activity in the U.S.

Yardley proved to be a very good administrator and during the war the people of MI-8 performed well even if they did not have any spectacular successes. After the war, the American Army and the State department decided to jointly fund MI-8 and Yardley continued as head of the &quot;Cipher Bureau&quot;. They located their operations in New York City for legal reasons.

Cracking Japanese codes was a priority. David Kahn states:

After almost a year, Yardley and his staff finally managed to break the Japanese codes and were still reading Japanese diplomatic traffic when Washington hosted the Washington Naval Conference in 1921. The information the Cipher Bureau provided the American delegation regarding the Japanese government&#x27;s absolute minimum acceptable battleship requirements was instrumental in getting the Japanese side to agree to a 5:3 ratio instead of the 10:7 ratio the Japanese Navy really wanted. This allowed Japan only 18 battleships to 30 for the U.S. and 30 for Great Britain instead of the 21 battleships Japan desired. This was the height of Yardley&#x27;s cryptanalytic career.

Unfortunately, Yardley spent much of his time in New York involved in unrelated activities. Also, the flow of diplomatic telegrams dried up as companies became less willing to break the law to help the government. In Washington, William Friedman was actively exploring cryptographic frontiers for the Army. The Cipher Bureau was becoming irrelevant. Herbert Hoover&#x27;s Secretary of State, Henry L. Stimson, closed the Cipher Bureau, likely for budgetary reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSA/CSS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; But Stimson was also ethically opposed to cryptology in peace time. Upon finding out about Yardley and the Cipher Bureau, Stimson was furious and withdrew funding, summing up his argument with &quot;Gentlemen do not read each other&#x27;s mail.&quot; Some believe that Stimson was most offended when Yardley bragged that he could read all traffic of the Vatican, for it was after this remark that Stimson turned and left the room.

In 1929, President Herbert E. Hoover&#x27;s new secretary of state, Henry L. Stimson, was provided with a few selected translations so he could become acquainted with the Black Chamber&#x27;s skills. Stimson was shocked. &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he later pronounced, &quot;do not read each other&#x27;s mail.&quot; Having solved the codes of some 20 nations, the Black Chamber was forced to shut down.

==&quot;The American Black Chamber&quot;==
MI-8 closed its doors for good on October 31, 1929, just two days after the stock market crashed. With Yardley&#x27;s esoteric skills in very low demand, and no government pension due to his secretly funded work, he took up writing about his experiences in codebreaking to support his family. His memoirs, &quot;The American Black Chamber&quot;, were published by Bobbs-Merrill in 1931. The book outlined the history of the first U.S. Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) organization, described the activities of MI-8 during World War I and the American Black Chamber in the 1920s, and illustrated the basic principles of signals security.

This work was instantly popular. Its critics at the time concluded that it was &quot;the most sensational contribution to the secret history of the war, as well as the immediate post-war period, which has yet been written by an American. Its deliberate indiscretions exceed any to be found in the recent memoirs of European secret agents.&quot; In the U.S., 17,931 copies were sold, with 5,480 more sold in the U.K. It was translated into French, Swedish, Japanese, and Chinese. The Japanese version sold an unprecedented 33,119 copies.

This book was an embarrassment to the U.S. government and compromised some of the sources Yardley and his associates used. Through this work an estimated 19 nations were alerted that their codes were broken. Much of the post-World War I codebreaking was done by obtaining copies of enciphered telegrams sent over Western Union by foreign diplomats, as was the custom before countries had technology for specialized communications devices. William F. Friedman, considered the father of modern American signals intelligence (SIGINT) gathering, was incensed by the book and the publicity it generated in part because sources and methods were compromised and because Yardley&#x27;s contribution was overstated.

While Yardley may have thought that publishing this book would force the government to re-establish a SIGINT program, it had the opposite effect. The U.S. government considered prosecuting him, but he had not technically violated existing law regarding protection of government records. In 1933, the Espionage Act was amended, PL 37 (USC Title 18, section 952), to prohibit the disclosure of foreign code or anything sent in code. Yardley&#x27;s second book, &quot;Japanese Diplomatic Codes: 1921-1922&quot;, was seized by U.S. marshals and never published. The manuscript was declassified in 1979.

&quot;The American Black Chamber&quot; represents an early example of the exposé national security books that would appear after World War II, such as &quot;The Codebreakers&quot; and &quot;The Puzzle Palace&quot;, which also focus on U.S. SIGINT operations and organizations.

In 1935, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released &quot;Rendezvous,&quot; a fictional film &quot;based on a book by Herbert O. Yardley.&quot; The film, starring William Powell and Rosalind Russell, and directed by William K. Howard, concerns a German spy ring stealing U.S. government codes during World War I, as well as U.S. Army efforts to crack German codes.

James Bamford devoted an entire chapter of &quot;The Puzzle Palace&quot; to an account of Yardley&#x27;s career. Previous accounts of Yardley&#x27;s career had said that the publication &quot;American Black Chamber&quot;, in Japan, had been one of the key triggers to Japanese militarism, because it exposed how American codebreakers had helped force Japan to accept an unfairly small limitation on its Naval tonnage. Bamford revealed that the book was even more infuriating to key Japanese militarists, because, prior to its publication Japanese military intelligence had paid him a fortune for the same information he published for the whole world to see.

==Later life==
Yardley did cryptologic work for Canada (although pressure from the US on the Canadian government meant it was limited) and China during World War II, but he was never again given a position of trust in the US government. Still, in 1999 he was given a place in the National Security Agency Hall of Honor.

None of Yardley&#x27;s many later attempts at writing was as successful as &quot;The American Black Chamber&quot;, but he published several articles and three spy/mystery novels (&quot;The Blonde Countess&quot;, &quot;Red Sun of Nippon&quot;, and &quot;Crows Are Black Everywhere&quot;). He contributed as a writer and technical advisor to several movies, including &quot;Rendezvous&quot;, based very loosely on one of his novels, &quot;The Blonde Countess&quot;. His 1957 book on poker, &quot;Education of a Poker Player&quot;, which combined poker stories with the math behind the poker strategies, sold well. When it was published in the UK in 1959, Ian Fleming was asked to write a preface. Another book of cryptographic memoirs, &quot;The Chinese Black Chamber&quot;, about his work in China, was declassified and published in 1983.

In August 1958, Yardley died in Washington, D.C., nearly a week after having a major stroke. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Grave 429-1 of Section 30.

Yardley is a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.

The National Cryptologic Museum&#x27;s library has 16 boxes of intercepted messages and translations from the Cipher Bureau, previously misidentified as Yardley&#x27;s personal papers.

<text>The coat of arms of [[Burundi]], adopted in 1966, consists of a shield surrounded by three spears. On the shield is the motto of the nation, as well as the head of a lion. Behind the shield there are three crossed traditional African spears. Under the shield the national motto of Burundi appears on a scroll: &quot;Unité, Travail, Progrès&quot; (French: &quot;Unity, Work, Progress&quot;).

== Official description ==
The constitution of Burundi describes the coat of arms as follows:

&quot;The motto of Burundi is &quot;Unité, Travail, Progrès&quot;. The emblem of the Republic is a shield charged with a head of a lion, together with three spears, the whole surrounded by the national motto.&quot;

== History ==
The previous coat of arms of the Kingdom of Burundi, used from 1962 until 1966, looked very similar, except that the royal &quot;karyenda&quot; drum was surmounted on the top as a symbol of the &quot;mwami&quot; (king), surrounded by two laurels. The number of spears was four. The national motto was &quot;Ganza Sabwa&quot;, which is in Kirundi and roughly means &quot;(the mwami) rules and reigns&quot;.

<text>Edward Benjamin Townsend (April 16, 1929 – August 13, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. He performed and composed &quot;For Your Love&quot;, a rhythm and blues doo-wop classic, and co-wrote &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; with Marvin Gaye.

==Biography==
Townsend was born in Fayetteville, Tennessee, United States, in 1929, and his family soon moved to Memphis, where his father was pastor at an African Methodist Episcopal church.

The year Townsend graduated from high school, he was elected to the International American Methodist Episcopal Youth Council (IAMEYC) and traveled worldwide before enrolling in college the next year at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (formerly Arkansas AM&amp;N College). After graduating, he taught for a year. Although he never formally practiced law, he frequently used his law training to assist other entertainers in negotiating their recording and performance contracts.

In 1951, Townsend joined the United States Marine Corps and served in Korea. After his discharge, he recorded a number of singles for various labels, none of which made the charts. In 1958, he took his ballad, &quot;For Your Love&quot; to Capitol Records, hoping to interest Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, but, impressed with his voice, Capitol signed him to record it himself. Dick Clark had just started &quot;American Bandstand&quot; on television and invited Townsend to sing the first month the show aired. He was an overnight success, and the song peaked at number 13 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Later in 1958 he reached No. 59 with a rendition of &quot;When I Grow Too Old to Dream&quot;.

Townsend had no further vocal hits of his own. In 1962, he wrote a song for soul singer, Jimmy Holiday, &quot;How Can I Forget?&quot;, which was later covered by Ben E. King. Then he wrote and produced Theola Kilgore&#x27;s &quot;The Love of My Man.&quot; He also composed &quot;Tears Of Joy&quot;, &quot;Hand It Over&quot;, &quot;I Might Like It&quot;, &quot;Since I Found You&quot; and &quot;Foolish Fool&quot;. In the early 1970s, Ed Townsend teamed up with Marvin Gaye to co-write the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;, and co-produce the album of the same title.

Townsend performed on the PBS television special &quot;Rock, Rhythm, and Doo Wop&quot; filmed at the Benedum Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on May 16 and 17, 2000. DVDs of the event were sold as fundraisers for PBS stations nationwide.

He died of a heart attack on August 13, 2003. Honored with a Purple Heart in the Korean War, Townsend is buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California.

Ed&#x27;s son David Townsend, of the band Surface, died at age fifty in 2005.

<doc id="475861" wikidata="Q504133" url="?curid=475861" title="Jalapeño">
<text>The jalapeño ( , , ) is a medium-sized chili pepper pod type cultivar of the species &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot;. A mature jalapeño chili is long and wide, and hangs down from the plant. The pungency of jalapeño peppers varies, but is usually between 4,000 and 8,500 units on the Scoville scale. Commonly picked and consumed while still green, it is occasionally allowed to fully ripen and turn red, orange, or yellow. It is wider and generally milder than the similar Serrano pepper.

==History and etymology==

The jalapeño is variously named &quot;huachinango&quot;, for the ripe red jalapeño, and &quot;chile gordo&quot; (meaning &quot;fat chili pepper&quot;) also known as &quot;cuaresmeño&quot;.

The name &quot;jalapeño&quot; is Spanish for &quot;from Xalapa&quot;, the capital city of Veracruz, Mexico, where the pepper was traditionally cultivated.

Genetic analysis of &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot; places jalapeños as a distinct genetic clade with no close sisters that are not directly derived from jalapeños. Jalapeños were in use by the Aztecs prior to the Spanish conquest; Bernardino de Sahagún in the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot; writes of Aztec markets selling chipotles (smoked jalapeños) and mole made from chipotles, besides the sale of fresh chilies. The use of peppers in the Americas dates back thousands of years, including the practice of smoking some varieties of peppers in order to preserve them; further well preserved samples and genetic testing would be needed to determine the usage and existence of the jalapeño clade and pod type into the past.

==Cultivation==
In 1999, roughly of land in Mexico was dedicated to jalapeño production; , that had decreased to . Jalapeños account for thirty percent of Mexico&#x27;s chili production, and while the total land area used for cultivation has decreased, there has been a 1.5% increase in volume yield per year in Mexico due to increasing irrigation, use of greenhouses, better equipment, knowledge, and improved techniques. Because of this, in 2009, 619,000 tons of jalapeños were produced with 42% of the crop coming from Chihuahua, 12.9% from Sinaloa, 6.6% from Jalisco, and 6.3% from Michoacán. La Costeña controls about 60% of the world market and, according to company published figures, exports 16% of the peppers that Mexico produces, an 80% share of the 20% that Mexico exports in total. The US imports 98% of La Costeña&#x27;s exports.

According to the USDA, since 2010 California produces the most jalapeños, followed by New Mexico and Texas - a total of of peppers in 2014. It is difficult to get accurate statistics on chilies and specific chilies as growers are not fond of keeping and sharing such data and reporting agencies often lump all green chilies together, or all hot chilies, with no separation of pod type. In New Mexico in 2002 the crop of jalapeños were worth $3 million at the farm gate and $20 million after processing.

China, Peru, Spain, and India also produce commercial chilies, including jalapeños.

 Jalapeños are a pod type of &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot;. The growing period is 70–80 days. When mature, the plant stands tall. Typically, a plant produces 25 to 35 pods. During a growing period, a plant will be picked multiple times. As the growing season ends, the peppers turn red, as seen in sriracha sauce. Jalapeños thrive in a number of soil types and temperatures, though they prefer warmer climates, provided they have adequate water. The optimum temperature for seed germination is , with degradation of germination seen above and little to no germination occurring at ; at the time to 50% germination rate depends on cultivar and seed lot but was tested as being between 4 and 5 days, which is shorter than cayenne. A pH of 4.5 to 7.0 is preferred for growing jalapeños, and well-drained soil is essential for healthy plants. Jalapeños need at least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight per day. Experiments show that unlike bell peppers at least 7.5 millimolar (mM) nitrogen is needed for optimal pod production, and 15 to 22 mM nitrogen produces the best result: the plant produces both more leaves and more pods, rather than just more leaves. Once picked, individual peppers may turn to red of their own accord. The peppers can be eaten green or red. Though usually grown as an annual they are perennial and if protected from frost can produce during multiple years, as with all &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot;.

Jalapeños are subject to root rot and foliar blight, both often caused by &quot;Phytophthora capsici&quot;; over-watering worsens the condition as the fungus grows best in warm wet environments. Crop rotation can help, and resistant strains of jalapeño, such as the &#x27;NuMex Vaquero&#x27; and &#x27;TAM Mild Jalapeño&#x27;, have been and are being bred as this is of major commercial impact throughout the world. As jalapeños are a cultivar, the diseases are common to &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot;: Verticillium wilt, &quot;Cercospora capsici&quot;, Powdery mildew,&quot; Colletotrichum capsici&quot; (Ripe Rot), &quot;Erwinia carotovora&quot; (Soft Rot), Beet curly top virus, Tospovirus (Tomato spotted wilt virus), Pepper mottle virus, Tobacco mosaic virus, Pepper Geminiviridae, and Root-knot nematode being among the major commercially important diseases.

After harvest, if jalapeños are stored at they have a shelf life of up to 3–5 weeks. Jalapeños produce 0.1–0.2 μL per kg per hour of ethylene, very low for chilies, and do not respond to ethylene treatment. Holding jalapeños at 20–25 °C and high humidity can be used to complete the ripening of picked jalapeños. A hot water dip of for 4 minutes is used to kill off molds that may exist on the picked peppers without damaging them. The majority of jalapeños are wet processed, canned, or pickled on harvesting for use in mixes, prepared food products, and salsas.

===Hybrids and sub-cultivars===
There are a wide variety of breeds for consumer and commercial use of jalapeño plants. The majority fall under one of four categories: F1 hybrids, where the parent plants have been hand-emasculated and cross-bred to produce uniform offspring with hybrid vigor; cultivars which are F-11 or F-12 hybrids or later generations where a stable unique population has been developed; landraces; and F2 hybrids.

F1 hybrids produce the highest and most uniform yields but cost 25 times the cost of open-pollinated seed, leading to only 2% of the farmland dedicated to jalapeño cultivation in the United States being planted with F1 hybrids. F2 hybrids often produce similarly to F1 hybrids; however, some F1 hybrids are produced via recessive male sterility to eliminate the need to hand-pollinate, reducing the cost to produce the hybrid, but producing a 25% reduction in yield in the F2 generation. Some notable F1 hybrids are &#x27;Mitla&#x27;, &#x27;Perfecto&#x27;, &#x27;Tula&#x27;, &#x27;Grande&#x27; (a hot jalapeño), &#x27;Sayula&#x27;, &#x27;Senorita&#x27;, and &#x27;Torreon&#x27;, most of them being developed and marketed by Petoseed, a brand of Seminis.

Cultivars are researched and created to promote desirable traits. Common traits selected for are resistance to viruses and other pepper-related diseases, milder peppers, early ripening, more attractive fruit in terms of size, wall thickness, and corking, and higher yields. The land-grant universities and the Chile Pepper Institute promote the use of cultivars as the most sustainable and environmentally safe disease control method both in terms of economics and long-term environmental perspective. Notable cultivars include &#x27;Early Jalapeño&#x27;, &#x27;TAM Mild Jalapeño&#x27;, &#x27;TAM Mild Jalapeño II&#x27;, &#x27;TAM Veracruz&#x27;, the yellow &#x27;TAM Jaloro&#x27;, &#x27;NuMex Vaquero&#x27;, the colorful &#x27;NuMex Piñata&#x27;, &#x27;TAM Dulcito&#x27;, &#x27;Waialua&#x27;, Biker Billy and &#x27;NuMex Primavera&#x27;.

===Sweet hybrids===
Sweet hybridized varieties have been created with no &quot;heat&quot;, although they retain the look and flavor of a jalapeño.

==Eating characteristics==

===Nutrients===
A raw jalapeño is 92% water, 6% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). A reference serving of raw jalapeños provides of food energy, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C, vitamin B6, and vitamin E, with vitamin K in a moderate amount (table). Other micronutrients are low in content (table).

===Scoville heat units===
Compared with other chillies, the jalapeño heat level varies from mild to hot depending on cultivation and preparation and can have from a few thousand to over 10,000 Scoville heat units. The number of scars on the pepper, which appear as small brown lines, called &#x27;corking&#x27;, has a positive correlation with heat level, as growing conditions which increase heat level also cause the pepper to form scars. For US consumer markets, &#x27;corking&#x27; is considered unattractive; however, in other markets, it is a favored trait, particularly in pickled or oil-preserved jalapeños.

The heat level of jalapeños varies even for fruit from the same plant; however, some cultivars have been bred to be generally milder, and on the low side of the heat range, such as the &#x27;TAM Milds&#x27; and &#x27;Dulcito&#x27;, and others to be generally hotter, and on the high end of the heat range, such as &#x27;Grande&#x27;. As the peppers ripen their pungency increases, making red jalapeños to be generally hotter than green jalapeños, at least of the same variety. If the jalapeño plants were stressed by increased water salinity, erratic watering, temperature, light, soil nutrition, insects, or illness, this will increase their pungency.

All of the capsaicin and related compounds are concentrated in vesicles found in the placenta membrane surrounding the seeds; the vesicles appear white or yellow and fluoresce in the range of 530 to 600 nm when placed in violet light. If fresh chili peppers come in contact with the skin, eyes, lips or other membranes, irritation can occur; some people who are particularly sensitive wear latex or vinyl gloves while handling peppers. If irritation does occur, washing the oils off with hot soapy water and applying vegetable oil to the skin may help. When preparing jalapeños, it is recommended that hands not come in contact with the eyes as this leads to burning and redness.

===Serving methods===
* Stuffed jalapeños are hollowed-out fresh jalapeños (served cooked or raw) filled with seafood, meat, poultry, or cheese.
* Pickled jalapeños, a type of pickled pepper, sliced or whole, are often served hot or cold on top of nachos, which are tortilla chips with melted cheese on top, a Tex-Mex dish.
* Chipotles are smoked ripe jalapeños.
* Jalapeño jelly, which is a pepper jelly, can be prepared using jelling methods.
* Jalapeño peppers are often muddled and served in mixed drinks.
* Jalapeño poppers are an appetizer; jalapeños are stuffed with cheese, usually cheddar or cream cheese, breaded or wrapped in bacon, and cooked.
* Armadillo eggs are jalapeños or similar chilis stuffed with cheese, coated in seasoned sausage meat and wrapped in bacon. The &quot;eggs&quot; are then grilled until the bacon starts to crisp.
* &quot;Chiles toreados&quot; are fresh jalapeños that are sauteed in oil until the skin is blistered all over. They are sometimes served with melted cheese on top.
* Texas toothpicks are jalapeños and onions shaved into straws, lightly breaded, and deep-fried.
* Chopped jalapeños are a common ingredient in many salsas and chilis.
* Jalapeño slices are commonly served in Vietnamese pho and bánh mì, and are also a common sandwich and pizza topping in the West.

===Culinary concerns===
Jalapeños are a low-acid food with a pH of 4.8–6.0 depending on maturity and individual pepper. If canned or pickled jalapeños appear gassy, mushy, moldy, or have a disagreeable odor, then to avoid botulism, special precautions are needed to avoid illness and spread of the bacteria. Canning or packaging in calcium chloride increases the firmness of the peppers and the calcium content, whether or not the peppers are pickled as well as canned.

In 2008, fresh jalapeños from Mexico were tested positive for &quot;Salmonella&quot; leading the FDA to believe that the peppers were responsible for much of the 2008 United States salmonellosis outbreak. This large outbreak of &quot;Salmonella&quot; led to increased research into the detection of pathogens on jalapeños, the frequency and behavior of foodborne illness related to jalapeños, and ways to prevent foodborne illnesses from fresh jalapeños. Contaminated irrigation water and processing water are the two most common methods by which jalapeños become contaminated, as was the case in the 2008 outbreak. Jalapeños have similar microbial properties to tomatoes. The outer layer of their skin provides a safe environment for pathogens to survive, and if damaged or chopped provides a growth medium for these pathogens. Washing fresh jalapeños is important to reduce pathogen counts both at the farm and consumer level, but without cold storage it is insufficient to prevent pathogen spread.

==In culture==
The jalapeño is a Mexican chili but was designated by the Texas Legislature as the official &quot;State Pepper of Texas&quot; in 1995. In Mexico, jalapeños are used in many forms such as in salsa, pico de gallo, or grilled jalapeños. Jalapeños were included as food on the Space Shuttle as early as 1982.

&quot;Guinness World Records&quot; recognizes Alfredo Hernandes for the most jalapeños eaten in a minute: 16, on 17 September 2006 at the La Costeña Feel the Heat Challenge in Chicago, Illinois. Patrick Bertoletti holds the Major League Eating jalapeño records at 275 pickled jalapeños in 8 minutes on 1 May 2011, and 191 pickled jalapeños in 6.5 minutes on 16 September 2007 in the &#x27;Short-Form&#x27;.

Joaquín Guzmán, also known as &quot;El Chapo&quot;, the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, operated a cannery in Guadalajara producing &quot;Comadre Jalapeños&quot; in order to ship cocaine to the US.

National Jalapeño Day is September 5th in the United States.

<text>Escort is a British men&#x27;s softcore adult magazine featuring erotica published monthly by &quot;Blue Active Media Ltd&quot;. It is published by Paul Raymond Publications, a company that also publishes a number of similar magazines, including &quot;Club International&quot;, &quot;Mayfair&quot;, &quot;Men Only&quot;, &quot;Men&#x27;s World&quot;, and &quot;Razzle&quot;. The origin of these titles lies in businessman Paul Raymond&#x27;s expansion from strip club management into magazine publishing in the 1960s.

== Publication history ==
A monthly pin-up magazine with the title &quot;Escort&quot; was published between 1958 and 1971 by City Magazines. The title was acquired by Raymond, and from 1971 to 1980 was incorporated into another title he had acquired from City Magazines, &quot;Men Only&quot;.

In 1980, Raymond began publishing &quot;Escort&quot; as a top-shelf magazine with the revived title. By 2012, &quot;Escort&quot; was in its 32nd year, or volume. The magazine is also sold in digital format. Initially this was via the Paul Raymond digital newsstand from 2013 until that website closed. Subsequently it has been available digitally from the publisher&#x27;s main website.

== Content ==
The magazine&#x27;s content is a combination of photographs and text, with the photographs almost entirely being those of partially or completely nude women.

&quot;Escort&quot; specialises in pictures of amateur (i.e. non-professional) models, some of which are sent to the magazine by readers – these are described as &quot;readers&#x27; wives&quot;. It often features photo-shoots taken in an &quot;ordinary&quot; location like a pub, or outdoors at a place familiar to British readers.

In 2008 Stephen Bleach, who had worked as publishing director for Paul Raymond Publications, described &quot;Escort&quot; as &quot;cheerfully brazen&quot; in contrast to &quot;Club International&quot; and &quot;Men Only&quot;, which he described as &quot;pseudo-glamorous&quot;. In 2013 &quot;Escort&quot; was described by Pierre Perrone, a former magazine editor for the company, as &quot;downmarket&quot;.

The theme of the exposition was &quot;The Challenge of a New Road of Development&quot;, with various other sub-themes around sustainable and &#x27;green&#x27; development. The exposition was an officially endorsed Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) specialized exposition commemorating the centenary of the first-ever representation of the &quot;Hermit Kingdom&quot; (Korea) to a world exposition, namely the 1893 Columbian Exposition of Chicago. It claimed to be the first exposition held in a developing country, although both the BIE-sanctioned Exposition internationale du bicentenaire de Port-au-Prince in 1949 and Shanghai&#x27;s Expo 2010 could also claim this title.

==Site zoning==
The exposition site consisted of three main areas - the international zone, the corporate zone and the fun park zone.

Being a specialized exposition, the pavilions in the international zone were for the most part pre-fabricated and rented out to the various international participants for the duration of the exposition. 108 nations and 33 international organizations participated at Taejon Expo &#x27;93 - making it one of the largest expositions ever held. Among the most memorable were the flagship Korean and United Nations Pavilions.

The corporate zone represented the best wizardry that Korean companies could afford, with some spectacular architecture and contents, all along the theme of the exposition, with the majority of these pavilions being permanent in nature. Pavilions included &quot;Starquest&quot; by Samsung, and the three-dimensional IMAX presentation courtesy of Daewoo. For the Korean Air Lines sponsored pavilion, award-winning experience designer Bob Rogers (designer) and the design team BRC Imagination Arts and Iwerks Entertainment (SimEx-Iwerks) produced a 360 degree 9-screen travelogue of a Korean girl who receives magical Circlevision postcards from her pen pals around the world.

There was also the Kumdori Land fun-park zone, named after the Expo&#x27;s alienesque mascot &quot;Kumdori&quot; (Twinkle, the Dream Being), which featured some of the latest in roller-coasters and other more traditional fun-park fare.

==Theme tower==
The center of the exposition was pinnacled by the 93-metre high &quot;Hanbit-tap&quot; - or Tower of Great Light, modeled on a traditional Korean Observatory, where guests could take a lift to the central viewing platform for a bird&#x27;s eye view of the whole exposition site. Today, this platform features a few physics experiments.

Also nearby are the flagship Korean National Pavilion and the United Nations Pavilion, which was built in the shape of a graceful dove.

==Present-day activities==
Today one can visit the former expo site, now called Expo Science Park savour the site from the Tower of Great Light, visit the United Nations Pavilion which now hosts the Daejeon Expo Commemorative Center, World Expo Souvenirs Museum, and Daejeon Unification Pavilion; or use one of the few remaining buildings which host occasional unrelated exhibitions. Further information on Expo Park could be found at the official website. While no longer hosted, content was largely written in Korean, with some English language sub-headings to allow for navigation. The site included the &#x27;Cyberspace&#x27; VR Panorama page where one could view 360 degree photo shoots of various aspects of the site. Part of the site is now being used for movie and television productions while another large piece has become the new headquarters for the Institute for Basic Science which relocated in 2018.

==Legacy==
Taejon Expo Science Park opened in June 1994. Only three main buildings remain from the expo in the park. These being the Tower of Great Light, the Government Pavilion, and the Peace and Friendship Pavilion. Apart from Expo Park, there is a Korean language legacy website for the Expo, a project of the Expo 93 Foundation, at http://www.expo93.co.kr/. One of the features of the website is an e-books section, where several dozen print resources from the Expo - all official Organising Committee publications - have been reproduced online. Whilst the majority of these are also in the Korean language, one publication in English is the comprehensive Expo 93 Travel Manual, which is located at this page.

After the event, the parking lots used for the Expo were transformed into the 387,000 sq/m (96 acre) Daejeon Hanbat Arboretum, the largest man-made arboretum in Korea.

Taejon Expo&#x27; 93, like many other former expo cities and regions, is a member of the BIE-endorsed A.V.E. - Association of Expo Cities and Regions, founded in Seville in 2002.

<doc id="475866" wikidata="Q174072" url="?curid=475866" title="Mangazeya">
<text>Mangazeya () was a Northwest Siberian trans-Ural trade colony and later city in the 17th century. Founded in 1600 by Cossacks from Tobolsk, it was situated on the Taz River, between the lower courses of the Ob and Yenisei Rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean. The name derives from a Nenets ethnonym &quot;Monkansi&quot; or &quot;Mongandi&quot;.

Russian settlers of the White Sea coasts of Russia (&quot;pomors&quot;) founded a route along the Arctic coast to Arkhangelsk to trade with Norwegian, English and Dutch merchants. Mangazeya accumulated furs and ivory (walrus tusks) around the year to be shipped out during the short Northern summer. Trade also occurred along the Siberian River Routes&#x27; Northern Route. It became &quot;a virtual Baghdad of Siberia, a city-state, all but independent of the Russian Empire in its wealth and utter isolation.&quot;

The Northern Sea Route was forbidden in 1619 under the penalty of death and the city closed to outsiders: navigational markings were torn up, posts established to intercept anyone who might attempt to get through, and maps were falsified. The state was unable to collect taxes, and there was a fear of English trading penetration into Siberia; furthermore, &quot;Mangazeya had aroused the envy of inland merchants working out of the Urals, Tyumen, and Tobolsk, who saw it siphoning off commerce that would otherwise have come their way.&quot; The city was finally abandoned following the catastrophic fire of 1678, after which the remaining population was evacuated to Turukhansk (now ) at the junction of the Yenisei with the Lower Tunguska, which was known as New Mangazeya until the 1780s.

The location of original Mangazeya and the Pomors&#x27; Northern Sea Route were forgotten until the 20th century, when archaeologists discovered remains of a wooden Kremlin and a Gostiny dvor (trading centre) on the site of Mangazeya.

There is a 220 kV electrical substation owned by Gazprom with the same name nearby.

<text>The French Film Festival - Richmond, VA was an annual film festival held in Richmond, Virginia, focused on recently produced French-language films.

It was created in 1993 by Drs. Peter and Françoise Kirkpatrick, professors of French literature, culture and film studies at Virginia Commonwealth University and University of Richmond, respectively. It is billed as the largest festival of French film in the United States. Since then, and as of 2015, it has welcomed a delegation totaling more than 380 directors, producers, actors, film scholars, critics, and French government officials. At the 2004 Festival, the Festival&#x27;s founders and directors, Drs. Peter and Françoise Ravaux-Kirkpatrick, were decorated as &quot;Chevaliers de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot;, a high honor in the arts in France, and in 2011, the Médaille Beaumarchais by the French Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques.

The festival usually takes place the last weekend of March, during which the city is filled with French speakers and aficionados of French cinema. It is held at the historic Byrd Theatre. At the 2014 Festival, there were approximately 22,000 attendees/tickets sold.

According to Richmond.com, in 2024 the newly retired and emeriti founders of the festival &quot;said it was the right time for the beloved festival to end.&quot;

== Festival ==

The festival is host to a variety of French films, both short and feature-length. to promote French language, cinema, and culture in the U.S. and in American educational institutions. French directors and starring actors engage the audience in question and answer sessions following the screening of their films.

The Festival is sponsored by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Unifrance, l&#x27;ARP (French acronym for &quot;Guild of French Directors and Producers&quot;), and the SACD (a French acronym for &quot;Guild of Authors, Composers and Directors&quot;). The Community Idea Stations (PBS), as well as the TV channel TV5Monde also are partners of the festival.
The Byrd Theatre, rated by &quot;USA Today&quot; in 2011 as one of the best film palaces remaining in North America, is the annual venue for the Festival. Each year, the French Film Festival brings to the Byrd Theatre the very same technicians and projectionists responsible for the screenings at the International Cannes Film Festival, ensuring the highest quality of both sounds and images 

== Programme ==

Each year, the festival showcases a selection of features, shorts and masterclasses in various sections:

*Feature and Short Selections – The main attraction of the festival
**&quot;Feature Films Selection&quot;– A selection of around 15 US and world premieres of recently produced French features (fictions and documentaries) all presented by their directors, screenwriters or starring actors and screened at the Byrd Theatre.
**&quot;Classics&quot; – A selection of a few award-winning restored French classics, also introduced by their director, cast or technicians.
**&quot;Special Screenings&quot; – exclusive screenings of newly found and restored French silent films by the likes of Georges Méliès or the Lumière Brothers, lent to the Festival by the French Cinémathèque.
**&quot;Short Films Selection&quot; – A selection of around 15 French short films screened at the &quot;Byrd Theatre&quot; and introduced by their directors and/or main actors.
*Master Classes – Each year, the festival organizes several master-classes with distinguished guests from its French delegation, each centered around one central theme as well as the guests&#x27;s career. All master classes are free and open to the public and either take place at the University of Richmond or at the Byrd Theatre.

== Delegation ==

A large delegation of French directors, actors and producers of feature and short films come to the Festival each year to present their films and also interact with the audience through question-and-answer sessions after each showing.

<text>USS &quot;Carnegie&quot; (CVE-38) (previously AVG-38 then later ACV-38) was an escort aircraft carrier built in 1942-43 for transfer to the United Kingdom. She was reclassified ACV-38 on 20 August 1942, and CVE-38 on 15 July 1943. She was commissioned on 9 August 1943 for a period of three days prior to being turned over to the United Kingdom, under whom she served as HMS &quot;Empress&quot; (D42).

==Design and description==

These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided a steam turbine, two boilers connected to one shaft giving 9,350 brake horsepower (SHP), which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts.

<doc id="475878" wikidata="Q5393515" url="?curid=475878" title="Ibero-American Exposition of 1929">
<text>The Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 (; ) was a world&#x27;s fair held in Seville, Spain, from 9 May 1929 until 21 June 1930. Countries in attendance of the exposition included: Portugal, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Ecuador. Each Spanish region and each of the provinces of Andalusia were also represented.

General Miguel Primo de Rivera, then Prime Minister of Spain, gave the opening address. Primo de Rivera allowed the Spanish King Alfonso XIII to give the final words and officially open the exposition. The purpose of the exposition was to improve relations between Spain and the countries in attendance, all of which have historical ties with Spain through either colonisation (parts of Spanish America and the United States) or political union (Portugal and Brazil). Other countries were represented at the &quot;International section&quot; in Barcelona.
==Background==

The exposition was smaller in scale than the International Exposition held in Barcelona during that same year, but it was not lacking in style. The city of Seville had prepared for the Exposition over the course of 19 years. The exhibition&#x27;s buildings were constructed in María Luisa Park along the Guadalquivir River. A majority of the buildings were built to remain permanent after the closing of the exposition.

Many of the buildings built to represent the foreign countries participating in the event, including that of the United States, were to be used as consulates after the closing of the exhibits. By the opening of the exposition all of the buildings were complete, although many were no longer new. Not long before the opening of the Exposition, the Spanish government also began a modernization of the city in order to prepare for the expected crowds by erecting new hotels and widening the medieval streets to allow for the movement of automobiles.

==Pavilions and exhibits==
===Spain===

Spain spent a large amount of money in developing its exhibits for the fair and constructed elaborate buildings to hold them. The exhibits were designed to show the social and economic progress of Spain as well as expressing its culture.

Spanish architect Aníbal González Álvarez-Ossorio designed the largest and most famous of the buildings, which surrounded the Plaza de España. The largest of the exhibits housed in this building was located in the Hall of the Discovery of America (). The building contained documents, maps, and other objects related to Christopher Columbus&#x27; discovery of the Americas, including a set of 120 letters and manuscript that had belonged to him, the last testament of Hernán Cortés, and detailed dioramas of historic moments. An exact replica of the &quot;Santa María&quot;, Columbus&#x27;s ship, complete with a costumed crew, floated on the Guadalquivir River.

The cities of Spain contributed structures designed to reflect their unique cultures to be placed in the &quot;Pavilions of the Spanish regions&quot; (). Spain&#x27;s exhibits also included a large collection of art located in the &quot;Palacio Mudéjar&quot; (&quot;Mudéjar art palace&quot;), &quot;Palacio Renacimiento&quot; (&quot;Renaissance palace&quot;), and the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Palace of the Royal House&quot;).

The Institute of Art from the University of Seville was moved to the Palacio Mudéjar for the duration of the exposition on the permission gained from the exposition committee by Count Columbi. The committee also set aside funds from their budget to purchase materials for the Institute.

In total, Spain built 11 pavilions and two additional buildings.

===Iberian America===

Of the Iberian American nations in attendance of the exposition, 10 constructed pavilions to display their exhibits. Other nations, including Bolivia, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Ecuador displayed their native products in the Commercial galleries of the Americas ().

*: The was designed by architect Martin Noel, and included a movie theatre and displays focusing on Argentinean industries and products.
*: The contained a coffee cultivation exhibit complete with panoramas and models illustrating the different phases of cultivation. Architect Pedro Paulo Bernardes Bastos designed the pavilion, which also included a coffee bar.
* Chile: The was the work of architect Juan Martínez Gutiérrez, who designed the three-story building. The exhibits included displays of Chilean industries, including detailed replicas of a nitrate mine and a copper plant, Araucanian arts and crafts, and galleries displaying Chilean art and history.
*: The was designed by Seville architect José Granados. The pavilion included a collection of sculpture and artwork by Colombian artist Rómulo Rozo, and of Colombian emeralds, and a coffee café that demonstrated all of the steps in coffee cultivation.
*: The contributed demonstrations of the sugar and tobacco industries to the exposition in their pavilion. Murals in the building were done by painter Pastor Argudín Pedroso.
* Dominican Republic: The was designed by Martín Gallart y Canti and included a reproduction of the Columbus&#x27;s Alcázar.
*: The Guatemalan pavilion was designed by Emilio Gómez Flores and José Granados de la Vega. The country signed up late for the exhibition and, as a result, rather than resembling a huge palace, its pavilion looks more like a school portable building with blue and white tiles on the front. The building contained exhibits relating to the resources found in Guatemala.
*: The Mexican pavilion was designed by and included exhibits on archeology, education, and the history of Spanish accomplishments in Mexico. Students in Mexican schools prepared some of the education exhibits.
* Peru: The Peruvian pavilion was designed by architect , being the largest of the ten pavilions. It contained a large archeology collection consisting of three halls filled with pre-Columbian era artifacts, which were to be kept on permanent display. The pavilion also contained an agricultural exhibit filled with stuffed vicuñas, alpacas, llamas, and guanacos. The exhibit was complemented by a pack of live llamas grazing on the pavilion grounds. It currently functions as the country&#x27;s consulate and as a science museum.
* Portugal: The was designed by Carlos and Guilherme Rebelo de Andrade, and currently serves as the country&#x27;s consulate.

*: The was designed by William Templeton Johnson. The United States&#x27; contribution to the exposition consisted of three buildings and marked the end to a several year period in which the U.S. did not construct buildings for foreign expositions. The main building was to serve as the U.S. consulate office after the closing of the exposition, and housed a menagerie of electrical appliances including oil furnaces, electric refrigerators, airplane models, and miniature wind tunnels. The other two structures housed a movie theatre and government exhibits, including contributions from the Departments of Agriculture, Treasury, and Labor, the Commission of Fine Arts, the Navy, and the Library of Congress.
*: The included displays of its industrial schools, including the Institute of Agronomy and an art gallery filled with paintings and bronze sculptures.
*: The was designed by Germán de Falla and also erected a pavilion containing displays of its resources.

==Legacy==

Today, many of the pavilions from the exposition remain, notably the famous Plaza de España, which chronicles each of the regions of Spain in ceramic provincial alcoves and benches, as well as some of the national pavilions, which have now been converted to Consulate-Generals. Many of the buildings have been converted into museums and the pavilion of Argentina is now a flamenco school. They have also been featured in a number of films, including &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, among others.

For Sevillans, the exposition marked the acceptance by the upper class of the &quot;traje de flamenca&quot;, an outfit worn by lower-class women.

The Exposition is reviewed by Evelyn Waugh in his collected travel writings, &#x27;When The Going Was Good&#x27; 1946, Duckworth. See &#x27;A Pleasure Cruise in 1929&#x27;.

<text>USS &quot;Cordova&quot; (CVE-39) (originally AVG-39 then later ACV-39) was an escort carrier launched 27 December 1942 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding of Tacoma, Washington; sponsored by Mrs. A. E. Mitchell. Reclassified CVE-39 on 15 July 1943, &quot;Cordova&quot; was transferred to the Royal Navy on 25 August 1943, as HMS &quot;Khedive&quot; (D62)

&quot;Khedive&quot; served as the command ship for the Allied landings in southern France, in August 1944. From April to August 1945, she was with the East Indies Fleet as part of the 21st Aircraft Carrier Squadron. &quot;Khedive&quot; was to take part in the invasion of Singapore in September 1945, codenamed Operation Tiderace. But with the Japanese surrender, she was merely deployed to the island for security.

She was returned to United States custody on 26 January 1946 and sold into merchant service 23 January 1947 as &quot;Rempang&quot; (later &quot;Daphne&quot;). She was sold for scrap in Spain in 1975.

==Design and description==
These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by a steam turbine, two boilers connected to one shaft giving , which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Hellcat, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

<text>Samuel Knox Skinner (born June 10, 1938) is an American politician, lawyer, and businessman. Skinner served as U.S. Secretary of Transportation and White House Chief of Staff under President George H. W. Bush. Prior to the Bush administration, Skinner served as the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois under President Gerald R. Ford from 1975 to 1977, succeeding James R. Thompson.

==Early life==
Skinner was born in Chicago, Illinois, on June 10, 1938, the son of Imelda Jane Curran and Vernon Orlo Skinner. He grew up in Springfield, Illinois and Wheaton, Illinois, and graduated from Wheaton Community High School in 1956. He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science in accounting. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha, Beta Eta chapter at the University of Illinois. Upon graduation, he served as a lieutenant and a tank platoon leader in the United States Army in 1960–1961. He graduated from DePaul University Law School in 1966, where he served on the law review. Skinner has been involved in the Boy Scouts most of his life, earning the Eagle Scout award as a youth in Wheaton&#x27;s Troop 35, and being honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award as an adult.

After his military service, Skinner held various sales and management positions with the IBM Corporation from 1960 to 1968. In 1967, IBM selected him Outstanding Salesman of the Year. Although offered position to serve as assistant to the chairman of IBM, Thomas Watson Jr., Skinner decided to enter a career in public service.

==Law career==

From 1968 to 1975, Skinner served in the office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois as an assistant United States attorney (AUSA) and, in 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed the 37-year-old Skinner the United States Attorney. As an AUSA, Skinner fought organized crime and public corruption. In 1974, Skinner and co-counsel, then United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois and future Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson, successfully prosecuted then-U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Otto Kerner, Jr.

This was the first time in U.S. history that a sitting federal court of appeals judge was found guilty of a federal crime. During his tenure at the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office, Skinner also worked directly with future U.S. Court of Appeals Judges William J. Bauer, Joel M. Flaum, and Ilana Rovner, U.S. District Court Judge Charles P. Kocoras, future U.S. Attorneys for the Northern District of Illinois Dan K. Webb and Anton R. Valukas, future United States Senator Carol Moseley Braun, and future Illinois Attorney General Tyrone C. Fahner.

From 1977 to 1989, Skinner practiced law as a senior partner in the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP, where he served on the firm&#x27;s executive committee and as its second lateral partner in its 100-year-old history. From 1984 to 1988, while practicing law full-time, he also served as chairman of the regional transportation authority of northeastern Illinois, the nation&#x27;s second-largest mass-transportation district. Also during that time, President Reagan appointed Skinner as vice chairman of the President&#x27;s Commission on Organized Crime.

==George H. W. Bush administration==
After leaving the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office for a career in the private sector, Skinner became active in Republican politics in Illinois. Skinner led the Illinois efforts of George H. W. Bush&#x27;s unsuccessful 1980 presidential campaign and successful 1988 presidential campaign, the last time a Republican candidate for president carried Illinois in the general election.

In December 1988, Skinner was nominated by President Bush to serve as Secretary of Transportation. Skinner was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on January 31, 1989, and assumed the office on February 6, 1989.

As Secretary of Transportation, he served as chief executive officer of a cabinet-level federal department with a budget over $30 billion and a workforce of 105,000 people. During his tenure, Skinner was credited with numerous successes, including the development of the President&#x27;s National Transportation Policy and the passage of landmark aviation and surface-transportation legislation. He also issued regulations mandating wheelchair lifts on buses. In addition, Skinner was instrumental in developing President Bush&#x27;s Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which served as the catalyst for the whole ITS industry.

He also developed the &quot;open skies&quot; policy of the United States that liberalized U.S. international policy and significantly increased the number of international flights to and from the U.S. In addition, Skinner acted as the President&#x27;s point person in numerous crisis situations, including the Eastern Air Lines strike, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the northern California earthquake, Hurricane Hugo, and the 1991 national rail strike. Skinner&#x27;s role in these emergencies earned him the moniker &quot;the Master of Disaster&quot;. &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine twice gave Skinner its highest ranking for his performance as Secretary of Transportation.

After Dick Thornburgh resigned as Attorney General in 1991 to run for the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the death of John Heinz, Skinner was offered the position. However, he turned down the role due to the inability of the Attorney General to engage in election-related political activity per the Hatch Act of 1939. In December 1991, Skinner left his job as Secretary of Transportation to replace John H. Sununu as White House Chief of Staff.

As White House Chief of Staff, Skinner acted as the President&#x27;s chief surrogate and led the implementation of the President&#x27;s domestic policy agenda leading into the 1992 general election. Under Sununu, domestic policy initiatives had drifted into the background in favor of foreign policy centered around the Persian Gulf War. Skinner served in the position from December 1991 until August 1992, when he was asked to work on the campaign full-time at the Republican National Committee and was replaced as chief of staff by then-Secretary of State James Baker.

==Post-Bush administration career==
Upon leaving the White House, Skinner returned to Chicago and became president of Commonwealth Edison and its holding company Unicom Corporation (now Exelon) from 1993 to 1998. In 1998, Skinner left this role to become co-chairman of the Chicago-based law firm Hopkins and Sutter. In July 2000, he was named chairman, president, and CEO of US Freightways, retiring from that role three years later in April 2003.

Skinner is currently on the board of directors of Navigant Consulting, Echo Global Logistics, Virgin America, and the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, and an advisor to Metalmark Capital. He also serves as director emeritus of Express Scripts. In 2015, Skinner was appointed chairman of the Takata Corporation independent quality assurance panel to conduct an internal investigation of the company&#x27;s airbag manufacturing process.

Since 2006, Skinner has served as of counsel at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig. From 2003 to 2008, Skinner was an adjunct professor of management and strategy at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He serves on the board of visitors of the Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy. Mayor Lori Lightfoot appointed Skinner to lead the task force to assist the City in its efforts to recover from the economic consequences of COVID-19.

==Family==
Skinner and his first wife, Susan Ann Thomas, had three children. His eldest son, Thomas Vernon Skinner, is the former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s national compliance program, director of the EPA&#x27;s region 5, and current general counsel of Louisiana State University. Another son, Steven Knox Skinner, is the CEO of KemperSports, a privately owned company that manages over 100 golf courses across the country. His daughter, Jane Skinner Goodell, is a former news anchor on Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Happening Now&quot; and the wife of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.

Skinner currently resides in Winnetka, Illinois, with his wife, Honey Jacobs Skinner, a retired partner at the law firm Sidley Austin LLP. Together, they have two sons, Samuel Jacobs Skinner and William Curran Skinner. Actress Gillian Jacobs is his niece through marriage.

==Awards==
Skinner has been awarded honorary degrees from George Washington University and Lake Forest College.

In 2017, he was inducted as a laureate of the Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the state&#x27;s highest honor) by the governor of Illinois in the areas of government and law.

<text>The traditional Chinese holidays are an essential part of harvests or prayer offerings. The most important Chinese holiday is the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival), which is also celebrated in overseas ethnic Chinese communities (for example in Malaysia, Thailand, or the USA). Traditional holidays are varied from region to region but most are scheduled according to the Chinese calendar; exceptions, like the Qingming and winter solstice days, fall on the respective &quot;jieqi&quot; (solar terms) in the agricultural calendar.

==Public holidays==
Traditional holidays are generally celebrated in Chinese-speaking regions. For the most part however, only Chinese New Year, Qingming Festival, the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival are statutory public holidays. This is the case in both mainland China and Taiwan whilst Hong Kong and Macau also observe Buddha&#x27;s Birthday and Chung Yeung Festival. In Singapore, Chinese New Year is the only traditional Chinese public holiday, likewise with Malaysia.

Each region has its own holidays on top of this condensed traditional Chinese set. Mainland China and Taiwan observe patriotic holidays, Hong Kong and Macau observe Christian holidays, and Malaysia and Singapore celebrate Malay and Indian festivals.

<doc id="475887" wikidata="Q5225024" url="?curid=475887" title="HMS Speaker (D90)">
<text>HMS &quot;Speaker&quot; (D90), a , based on a &quot;C3&quot; hull, was originally the USS &quot;Delgada&quot; (AVG/ACV/CVE-40), which was transferred to the United Kingdom under the Lend-Lease program.

==Design and description==
These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by one shaft, two boilers and a steam turbine giving 9,350 shaft horsepower (SHP), which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

==Preparations==
&quot;Delgada&quot; was launched 20 February 1943 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation, Seattle, Washington; sponsored by Mrs. James B. Sykes and reclassified CVE-40 on 15 July 1943. She was transferred to the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease on 20 November 1943, and served as HMS &quot;Speaker&quot; (D90).

After the loading of equipment, familiarisation by the Royal Navy sailing crew and a day&#x27;s steaming trials, &quot;Speaker&quot; was accepted. She was formally commissioned on 20 November 1943, when the White Ensign was hoisted at a ceremony attended by the builders and the U.S. Naval authorities, and by 6 December she was ready to sail.
As delivered, these carriers required modifications to conform to British standards and the initial works were done at Burrards at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. These included extending the flight deck, fitting redesigned Rying controls and fighter direction layout, modifications to hangar, accommodation and store rooms, extra safety measures, oiling at sea arrangements, gunnery and other internal communications, extra wireless and radio facilities, ship black-out arrangements and other necessary items.

After working up off Vancouver, a passage through the Panama Canal on 8 March 1944 (which required temporary adaptations to conform to the width restrictions), further works at Norfolk, Virginia and loading crated aircraft, stores and passengers at Staten Island, New York, &quot;Speaker&quot; sailed for Liverpool on 8 March. She sailed with an eastbound convoy and arrived on 8 April. She returned to the U.S. to perform a second aircraft ferry run.

On 17 May, she was at Greenock awaiting orders. Now required to be an assault aircraft carrier, supporting army operations, she underwent further modifications at the Caledon Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company, Dundee.

While waiting for her squadron of Hellcats (1840 Naval Air Squadron) to complete their training, &quot;Speaker&quot; filled in as a training carrier from 16 October to 14 December. Nearly 1,500 landings were made by Fairey Barracuda, Fairey Swordfish and Curtiss Helldiver aircraft.

==En route to the Far East==
In late December, Squadron 1840 embarked with new rocket-fitted, Mk. III Hellcats. &quot;Speaker&quot; sailed from the Clyde for Gibraltar and the Mediterranean on 11 January 1945, in company with , and three destroyers. While passing through the Mediterranean, the flotilla flew an anti-submarine search off North Africa after a reported sighting by a merchantman, but without success. The flotilla continued on to join the Eastern Fleet at Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). They paused briefly at Alexandria and refuelled at Aden. Flying practice continued en route, one aircraft and pilot being lost in an accident in the Red Sea.

At Colombo, where they arrived on 4 February, &quot;Speaker&quot; and &quot;Slinger&quot; were ordered onward to join the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) at Sydney, Australia. While off Western Australia, the two carriers assisted in a search for survivors of a troopship sinking. They arrived at Sydney on 23 February. Eight of &quot;Speaker&quot;&#x27;s aircraft and pilots were transferred to . While in port, repairs and maintenance were completed and crew enjoyed shore leave in local homes.

==British Pacific Fleet==
&quot;Speaker&quot; left Sydney on 9 March for the BPF forward base at Manus Island, via the Jomard Passage. After a short and bleak stay, and now part of 30th Aircraft Carrier Squadron, they sailed on 18 March with &quot;Striker&quot; and an escort led by . Their role was to provide air cover (Combat Air Patrol) for the British fuelling area during Operation Iceberg (the invasion of Okinawa). The escort for the &quot;logistic&quot; force were British and Australian destroyers, sloops, frigates and corvettes (such as &quot;Pheasant&quot;, &quot;Crane&quot;, &quot;Woodcock&quot;, &quot;Whimbul&quot;, &quot;Avon&quot;, &quot;Derg&quot;, &quot;Findhorn&quot;, &quot;Parrett&quot;, &quot;Bathhurst&quot;, &quot;Cessnock&quot;, &quot;Pirie&quot; and &quot;Whyalla&quot;).

Despite the routine nature of the duty and the lack of combat action, the morale of the logistic force and its escorts remained high.

On 23 May, the BPF retired to Leyte, for replenishment and &quot;Speaker&quot;″s remaining pilots and aircraft, and some maintenance personnel, were transferred to &quot;Indomitable&quot; to boost front-line strength. &quot;Speaker&quot; was transferred to be a replenishment carrier, with a supply of replacement aircraft for the fleet&#x27;s operational losses and receiving &quot;flyable duds&quot; for repair and injured crew for treatment on the hospital ship &quot;Oxfordshire&quot;.

Operation Iceberg completed in mid-May and the BPF returned to Sydney for repairs, storing and shore leave for the crews. En route, &quot;Speaker&quot; took a sick Australian soldier off an American troopship (&quot;Pontius H. Ross&quot;) for emergency surgery.

==Post-war==
HMS &quot;Speaker&quot; was returned to the United States on 27 July 1946 having stopped at the Royal Naval Dockyard in Bermuda on 18 July where she disembarked Captain S.V. Jethson, RN, to take over duties as Captain Superintendent from Commodore-in-Charge Rear Admiral CH Knox-Little and as Captain-in-Charge of HM Naval Establishments in Bermuda and Commanding Officer of HMS Malabar, and Bermudian soldiers returning from overseas service in the Second World War, then having arrived at Norfolk Navy Yard on 20 July. The flight deck was removed and was sold into merchant service 22 April 1947 as &quot;Lancero&quot; (later renamed &quot;President Osmena&quot; in 1965 and &quot;Lucky One&quot; in 1971). The ship was sold for scrap in Taiwan in 1972.

<doc id="475889" wikidata="Q207592" url="?curid=475889" title="Sylvia Kristel">
<text>Sylvia Maria Kristel (28 September 1952 17 October 2012) was a Dutch actress and model who appeared in over 50 films. She was the eponymous character in five of the seven Emmanuelle films, including originating the role with &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; (1974).

==Early life==
Kristel was born in Utrecht, the Netherlands; she was the elder daughter of an innkeeper, Jean-Nicholas Kristel, and his wife Pietje Hendrika Lamme. In her 2006 autobiography, &quot;Nue&quot;, she stated that she was sexually abused by an elderly hotel guest when she was nine years old, an experience she otherwise refused to discuss. Her parents divorced when she was 14 years old, after her father abandoned the family for another woman. &quot;It was the saddest thing that ever happened to me,&quot; she said of the experience of her parents&#x27; separation.

==Career==
Kristel began modeling when she was 17 years old. In 1971, before becoming famous, she took part in auditions for the female lead (a role ultimately played by Maria Schneider) in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;. 

In 1973, she won the Miss TV Europe contest. She spoke Dutch, English, German, and Italian fluently, and several other languages to a lesser extent. Kristel gained international attention in 1974 for playing the title character in the softcore film &quot;Emmanuelle&quot;, which remains one of the most successful French films ever produced.

After the success of &quot;Emmanuelle&quot;, Kristel was often cast in films capitalizing on a similar sexually provocative image and in roles involving nudity. Notably, she starred in 
a 1981 film adaptation of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;; and in the title role of &quot;Mata Hari&quot; (1985), a biographical film about the World War I spy. She also appeared in lesser-known art house films by prominent French directors Claude Chabrol and Roger Vadim during the 1970s; and starred in &quot;La Marge&quot; (1976), a French box office success co-starring Joe Dallesandro and directed by Walerian Borowczyk.

Her typecast image as Emmanuelle would follow her into film roles in the United States. After her brief comic turn in the &quot;Get Smart&quot; revival film &quot;The Nude Bomb&quot; in 1980, Kristel starred in the sex comedy &quot;Private Lessons&quot; (1981) as Nicole Mallow, a maid who seduces a teenage boy. Although &quot;Private Lessons&quot; was one of the highest-grossing independent films of 1981 (ranking 28th in overall domestic box office receipts in the U.S.), Kristel reportedly saw none of the profits. She continued to appear in films and last played Emmanuelle in the early 1990s.

In addition to her early tryout for &quot;Last Tango,&quot; Kristel would often come close to having leading or supporting parts in several other major films over the first two decades of her career. She was cast as Stella in Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot; The Tenant&quot; (1976) but was replaced by Isabelle Adjani after one day of shooting. In 1977, she was an early choice to star as Hattie in Louis Malle&#x27;s controversial period drama &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; (1978), but the role eventually went to Susan Sarandon. Several years later, Malle asked her to play Ingrid in &quot;Damage&quot;, his 1992 drama of sexual obsession, but Kristel was unavailable at the time and Miranda Richardson was cast. She was friends with Sergio Leone, who wanted her for the role of Carol while casting &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984); the producers did not agree and the part went to Tuesday Weld. In 1982, she was turned down by Tony Scott for the role of Miriam in &quot;The Hunger&quot; (1983); Catherine Deneuve won the part. She also was considered for the role of Lois Lane in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), which went to Margot Kidder; and she unsuccessfully tried to win a role as a Bond Girl in four James Bond movies: &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977), &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979), &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981) and &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983).

Kristel also rejected the female leading roles in &quot;The Story of Adele H.&quot; (1975), &quot;King Kong&quot; (1976),&quot; Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; (1976), &quot;Caligula &quot;(1979), &quot;Body Heat&quot; (1981), &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983), &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), &quot;Body Double&quot; (1984) and &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986).
In 1992, her friend Gérard Depardieu, wanting to help secure her comeback, unsuccessfully tried to persuade the producers of &quot;1492: Conquest of Paradise&quot; to cast her as Queen Isabella I, ultimately played by Sigourney Weaver. 

In May 1990, she appeared in the television series &quot;My Riviera,&quot; filmed at her home in Saint-Tropez and offering insights on her life and motivations in an interview with writer-director Michael Feeney Callan. In 2001, she had a small role in &quot;Forgive Me&quot;, Dutch filmmaker Cyrus Frisch&#x27;s debut. In May 2006, Kristel received an award at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York, for directing the animated short film &quot;Topor and Me,&quot; written by Ruud Den Dryver. The award was presented by Gayle King.

After a hiatus of eight years, she appeared in the film &quot;Two Sunny Days&quot; (2010) and, that same year, in her last acting role, she played Eva de Leeuw in the Italian TV movie &quot;The Swing Girls&quot;.

In June 2021 it was announced that actress Sylvia Hoeks will play Sylvia Kristel in a biopic of her life and career.

==Personal life==

In September 2006, Kristel&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Nue&quot; (&quot;Nude&quot;) was published in France. The writing was translated into English as &quot;Undressing Emmanuelle: A Memoir&quot;, by Fourth Estate, 2 July 2007, in which she described a turbulent personal life that was blighted by addictions to drugs and alcohol, and her quest for a father figure, which resulted in some destructive relationships with older men. The book received some positive reviews.

She had her first major relationship with Belgian author Hugo Claus, who was more than two decades her senior. Their union from 1973 to 1977 produced her only child, a son named Arthur, who was born in 1975. She left her husband for British actor Ian McShane, whom she had met in 1976 on the set of the film &quot;The Fifth Musketeer&quot; (1979). They moved in together in Los Angeles, where he had promised to help launch her American career. However, their five-year affair led to no significant career break for Kristel, but a relationship she describes in her autobiography as &quot;awful he was witty and charming, but we were too much alike.&quot; She began using cocaine about two years into their relationship. This proved her downfall, although at the time she thought of it as a &quot;supervitamin, a very fashionable substance, without danger, but expensive, far more exciting than drowning in alcohol a fuel necessary to stay in the swing.&quot; Sylvia Kristel also had a year-long relationship with French singer Michel Polnareff.

Kristel was interviewed in 2006 for the documentary &quot;Hunting Emmanuelle.&quot; She described how she made a number of poor decisions due to an expensive cocaine addiction. One of those mistakes included selling her interest in &quot;Private Lessons&quot; to her agent for US$150,000; the film grossed more than US$26 million domestically. After McShane, she married twice, first in 1982 to Alan Turner, an American businessman. That marriage ended after five months, and she later married film producer Philippe Blot (1986–1991). She then spent a decade with Belgian radio producer Fred De Vree, until his death in 2004.

Her authorized biography was written by Dutch journalist Suzanne Rethans and was published in September 2019. It took Rethans more than three years to write it. Titled &quot;Begeerd en Verguisd&quot; (), it has not yet been translated into English.

==Illness and death==
Kristel was a heavy cigarette smoker from the age of 11. She was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2001, and underwent three courses of chemotherapy and surgery after the disease spread to her lungs. On 12 June 2012, she suffered a stroke and was hospitalized in critical condition. Four months later, she died in her sleep at age 60 from esophageal and lung cancer. Kristel is buried at her place of birth in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

<doc id="475895" wikidata="Q3630651" url="?curid=475895" title="Indian Army during World War II">
<text>The Indian Army during World War II, a British force also referred to as the British Indian Army, began the war, in 1939, numbering just under 200,000 men. By the end of the war, it had become the largest volunteer army in history, rising to over 2.5 million men in August 1945. Serving in divisions of infantry, armour and a fledgling airborne force, they fought on three continents in Africa, Europe and Asia.

The army fought in Ethiopia against the Italian Army, in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria against both the Italian and German armies, and, after the Italian surrender, against the German Army in Italy. However, the bulk of the Indian Army was committed to fighting the Japanese Army, first during the British defeat in Malaya and the retreat from Burma to the Indian border; later, after resting and refitting for the victorious advance back into Burma, as part of the largest British Empire army ever formed. These campaigns cost the lives of over 87,000 Indian servicemen, while 34,354 were wounded, and 67,340 became prisoners of war. Their valour was recognised with the award of some 4,000 decorations, and 18 members of the Indian Army were awarded the Victoria Cross or the George Cross. Field Marshal Claude Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army from 1942, asserted that the British &quot;couldn&#x27;t have come through both wars (World War I and II) if they hadn&#x27;t had the Indian Army.&quot; British Prime Minister Winston Churchill also paid tribute to &quot;The unsurpassed bravery of Indian soldiers and officers.&quot;

==Background==
In 1939, the Indian Army was an experienced British force, having fought in the Third Afghan War, two major campaigns in Waziristan, during 1919–1920 and 1936–1939, and in several smaller disputes on the North West Frontier since the First World War. There was no shortage of manpower to call upon, but the army did suffer from a shortage of skilled technical personnel. The conversion of the cavalry force into a mechanised tank force had only just begun and was hampered by the inability to supply adequate numbers of tanks and armoured vehicles.

In 1939, British officials had no plan for expansion and training of Indian forces, which comprised about 130,000 men (in addition, there were 44,000 men in British units in India in 1939). Their mission was internal security and defence against a possible Russian threat through Afghanistan. As the war progressed, the size and role of the Indian Army expanded dramatically, and troops were sent to battle fronts as soon as possible. The most serious problem was lack of equipment.

==Organisation==
The Indian Army of 1939 was different from the Indian Army during World War I (also a British force); it had been reformed in 1922, moving away from single battalion regiments to multi-battalion regiments. Overall, the army was reduced to 21 cavalry regiments and 107 infantry battalions. The field army now consisted of four infantry divisions and five cavalry brigades. There was a covering force of 12 infantry brigades to protect the North West Frontier from incursions and one third of the infantry, 43 battalions, were allocated to internal security and to aid the civil power. In the 1930s, the Indian Army began a programme of modernisation—they now had their own artillery—the Indian Artillery Regiment—and the cavalry had started to mechanise. By 1936, the Indian Army had committed to supplying in wartime a brigade each for Singapore, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, Burma and two for Egypt.
But, by 1939, further reductions had reduced the Indian Army to 18 cavalry regiments and 96 infantry battalions, in total 194,373 men including 34,155 non-combatants. They could also call upon 15,000 men from the Frontier Irregular Force, 22,000 men from the Auxiliary Force (India), consisting of European and Anglo-Indian volunteers, 19,000 from the Indian Territorial Force, and 53,000 from the Indian State forces.

There were twenty two regular regiments of cavalry, which supplied tank and armoured car units. (Seven more were raised during the war.) There were twenty regular Indian regiments of infantry (including the Burma Rifles) and ten Gurkha regiments. Before the war, all the Indian regiments had at least two battalions, and most had more. The Gurkha regiments had two battalions each. During the war, the Gurkha regiments raised a further two battalions each, while the Indian regiments raised up to fifteen each. Two further regiments (the Assam Regiment and the Burma Regiment) were created during the war.

The Indian Army started World War II underprepared and short of modern weapons and equipment. It had not expected to be involved in any hostilities and had been advised after the outbreak of war in Europe, by the British government, that it was unlikely to be required at all. So, it was with some surprise when the 4th Infantry and 5th Infantry divisions were requested to serve in the North African and East African Campaigns and four mule companies to join the British Expeditionary Force in France.

===1940===
In May 1940, agreement was reached between the British and Indian governments over the formation of another five infantry and one armoured divisions, which became the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th infantry and the 31st Indian Armoured Divisions. These new divisions were primarily intended to be used in the defence of Malaya (9th Division) and Iraq (6th, 8th and 10th Infantry divisions). The 3rd Indian Motor Brigade, from the armoured division, was to go to Egypt; the formation of the rest of the armoured division was put on hold, because of the shortage of armoured vehicles.

===1941===
In March 1941, the Indian government revised the defence plan for India. Concerned with what the Japanese were planning and the requirement to replace the divisions sent overseas, seven new armoured regiments and 50 new infantry battalions were needed for five new infantry divisions that were formed: the 14th, 17th, 19th, 20th, 34th and the two armoured formations 32nd Indian Armoured Division and 50th Indian Tank Brigade.

===1942===
With the fall of Singapore in 1942, about 40,000 Indian soldiers were captured. They were given a choice; 30,000 joined the Indian National Army. Those who refused became POWs and were mostly shipped to New Guinea.

With the previously formed divisions mostly committed overseas in 1942, the army formed another four infantry divisions (23rd, 25th, 28th, 36th) and the 43rd Indian Armoured Division. However, events during 1942 and the Japanese conquests meant that the 28th Division was not formed and the units earmarked for it were used elsewhere. The 36th Division, uniquely, was created as an Indian Army formation, but was formed from British brigades that had reached India from the Madagascar campaign and from Britain. The final division formed in 1942 was the 26th Indian Infantry Division, which was hastily formed from the various units in training or stationed near Calcutta.

After the perceived poor performance in battles in Malaya and Burma in 1942, it was decided that the existing infantry divisions were over–mechanised. To counter this, the 17th and 39th divisions were selected to become light divisions, of only two brigades which would rely more on animal and four-wheel-drive transport.

By December 1942, agreement was reached that India should become the base for offensive operations. Support should be in place for 34 divisions, which would include two British, one West African, one East African and eleven Indian divisions, and what was left of the Burma Army.

===1943===
The plans for 1943 included the formation of another infantry division, an airborne division and a heavy armoured brigade. Only the 44th Indian Armoured Division was formed, by amalgamating the 32nd and 43rd Armoured divisions. There was a change to the establishment of infantry divisions, which received two extra infantry battalions as divisional troops.

A committee was set up in 1943 to report on the readiness of the army and suggest improvements. Its recommendations were:
# The infantry should have first claims on cadet officers and educated recruits, the quality of officers and non commissioned officers (NCO) should be improved and there should be an increase in pay.
# Basic training should be increased to nine months followed by two months&#x27; specialised jungle training.
# The reinforcement system should be improved and drafts should include experienced NCO&#x27;s
# Infantry brigades should include a British, an Indian and a Gurkha battalion.

To assist in the jungle training of the infantry from July 1943, the 14th and 39th divisions were converted to training divisions. The 116th Indian Infantry Brigade, part of 39th Division, provided the specialised jungle conversion training. An infantry battalion would spend from four to six months with the brigade, before being sent to the front to replace a tired battalion in one of the fighting divisions. The brigades and units of the 14th Division provided jungle training for drafts of reinforcements for the Indian battalions already serving on the Burma front.

===1944===
The planned 44th Indian Airborne Division was finally formed from the 44th Armoured Division, leaving the 31st Armoured as the only armoured division in the army. The infantry division formation was changed again; it was now standardised as three infantry brigades plus three infantry battalions assigned as divisional troops.

The success of the 116th Brigade in training for jungle warfare was recognised. From May 1944, 116th Brigade trained units destined for the Fourteenth Army and 150th Brigade, which was converted from the Risalpur Training Brigade, trained units destined for the Southern Army. The 155th Indian Infantry Brigade was formed to provide training for units destined for the western theatres of war.

===Infantry divisions===
Infantry divisions consisted of three infantry brigades, of three infantry battalions. Usually, one battalion in each brigade was British and two were Indian or Gurkha. Four brigades were raised consisting entirely of Gurkha battalions. Later in the war, as British infantry reinforcements became more scarce, particularly in the South East Asian Theatre, British battalions in brigades fighting in Burma were replaced by Indian units.

In a division with a standard MT (Mechanical Transport) establishment, the divisional units were a reconnaissance unit provided by a mechanised cavalry regiment, and a heavy machine gun battalion armed with thirty-six Vickers machine guns. (Each Indian infantry regiment raised a machine gun battalion in addition to its infantry battalions.) The divisional artillery consisted of three field artillery regiments with twenty-four 25-pounder guns each, one anti-tank regiment with forty-eight anti-tank guns and one light anti-aircraft regiment with up to fifty-four light anti-aircraft guns. There were three engineer field companies and one engineer field park company, plus signals, medical and transport units.

There were variations on the infantry formation, depending on role. The light divisions (14th, 17th and 39th) as formed in 1942 had only two brigades and lacked much heavy equipment. Transport was provided by six mule and four Jeep companies. This type of division was later dropped. The Animal and Mechanised transport divisions (A &amp; MT) (7th, 20th and 23rd and later the 5th) had a mixture of animal and vehicle transport, as the name suggests. In particular, one of the vehicle-drawn field artillery regiments was replaced by a mountain artillery regiment with twelve 3.7-inch howitzers, carried on mules. The anti-tank and light anti-aircraft regiments were replaced by a single regiment, with two batteries each of anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. The divisional reconnaissance unit was replaced by a lightly equipped infantry battalion. Another standard infantry battalion provided the HQ Defence unit.

On 27 May 1944, General George Giffard (the commander of 11th Army Group) ordered that all Indian divisions fighting in Burma should adopt the A &amp; MT establishment. Late that year, however, Lieutenant General William Slim (commanding Fourteenth Army) converted two divisions (the 5th and 17th) to a mixed establishment of two motorised brigades and one airportable brigade, in anticipation of mechanised operations in the comparatively open terrain of central Burma. In April 1945, the 20th Division was also converted to a partially motorised establishment by acquiring the vehicles from a British division whose personnel were being withdrawn from Burma.

===Armoured divisions===
It was intended to form an armoured division in the plans for 1940, 1941 and 1942. However, the Indian armoured formations suffered from a lack of equipment. The shortage of tanks in 1940 was reflected in the organisation of 31st Armoured Division, which first had one armoured and two motor brigades. At the end of 1940, this was changed to two armoured and one motor brigade. When the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade was sent to Egypt, the British armoured division organisation of two armoured brigades and a Support group was adopted.

In June 1942, the division&#x27;s establishment was fixed as one armoured and one infantry brigade. The surplus armoured brigades (50th, 254th, 255th and the 267th) became independent brigades and served in the Burma campaign. In March 1943, the shortage of technical staff forced another review of the armoured force and the 32nd and 43rd armoured divisions were amalgamated to become the 44th Indian Armoured Division. In March 1944, a further review reduced the armoured force to one division (the 31st Armoured Division serving in the Middle East) and three tank brigades (the 50th, 254th and 255th) serving in Burma.

===Airborne troops===
The 50th Independent Indian Parachute Brigade was formed on 29 October 1941, with the British 151st Parachute Battalion, 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion and 153rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion, a medium machine gun company and a medium mortar detachment. The 151st Battalion was later renumbered as the 156th Battalion and returned to Britain and another Gurkha battalion (154th) was formed, but had not joined the brigade when it was heavily involved in the Battle of Sangshak in March 1944.

The headquarters of the 44th Indian Armoured Division was converted in April 1944, to 9th Indian Airborne Division, which was renamed the 44th Airborne Division a few weeks later. After a delay caused by the Japanese invasion of India, the division resumed forming in July. It absorbed the 50th Parachute Brigade, and later two brigades from the disbanding Chindit force The division now consisted of the 50th, 77th Parachute Brigades and 14th Airlanding Brigade, two field artillery regiments, two anti-aircraft regiments and a joint anti-aircraft and anti-tank regiment.

===Artillery===
The Royal Artillery still provided some of the artillery required for Indian Army formations, but the Indian Regiment of Artillery had been formed in 1935, initially consisting of four horse–drawn batteries. The regiment was expanded during the war and, by 1945, had formed 10 field artillery regiments, 13 mountain artillery regiments, 10 anti–tank artillery regiments. Three anti–aircraft brigades were formed from the four heavy anti–aircraft artillery regiments and five light anti–aircraft artillery regiments created. For the regiments service during the war, it was granted the title &quot;Royal Indian Artillery&quot; in 1945.

===Engineers===
The Indian Engineers were a part of every division in the army. The engineers corps started the war with two army troops companies, 11 Field Companies and one field park company. Expansion during the war took the totals of engineers to; five army troops companies, 67 Field companies, six independent field squadrons, 20 field park companies and two independent field park squadrons.

===Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Corps (India)===

The Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Corps (India) was formed in May 1942; recruits had to be a minimum age of 18 years and their duties were clerical or domestic. In December 1942, the minimum age was reduced to 17 years and 11,500 women had enlisted by the end of the war. Volunteers could enlist on Local service or General service terms. Those on General service could be sent to serve anywhere in India. Compared to over two million men, the corps of 11,500 women was small, but recruitment was always hampered by caste and communal inhibitions. Indian women at the time did not mix socially or at work with men and a large part of the corps was formed from the mixed-race Anglo–Indian community. The WAC(I) had an autonomous Air Wing, which served as the Indian counterpart of the WAAF: the women operated switchboards and similar duties at airfields and air headquarters (AHQ). In the earlier part of the war there was likewise a Naval Wing, but with the very localised environment of naval base and the very distinct ethos of the wartime naval services, British and Indian, this department was formally hived-off, in 1944, to become: the Women&#x27;s Royal Indian Naval Service (WRINS), with its own uniform, similar to WRNS.

===Indian States Forces (ISF)===

The armies of the Indian States or Princely states provided a further 250,000 men during the war. They contributed five cavalry regiments and 36 infantry battalions, and between them they had 16 infantry battalions plus signal, transport and pioneers companies away on active service. One of their men, Captain Mahmood Khan Durrani, was awarded the George Cross while in Japanese captivity.

===Chindits===

The Chindits (named after a mythical beast, statues of which guarded Burmese temples) were the brainchild of Brigadier Orde Wingate, who intended that long-range penetration raids behind enemy lines would become the main effort against the Japanese in Burma. In 1943, he mounted Operation &quot;Longcloth&quot; by the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade. In 1944, they staged a much larger operation which involved disbanding the 70th British Infantry Division, its three brigades together with three more brigades were grouped as &quot;Special Force&quot; and referred to for cover purposes as 3rd Indian Infantry Division. In practice, the four Indian Army battalions in Special Force were all from regiments of Gurkha Rifles. There was also a battalion of Burma Rifles, to provide reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. Chindits were in fact ordinary infantry units arbitrarily selected for the mission on the basis of their availability. There was no commando, airborne or other selection procedure, although there was some &quot;weeding out&quot; of less fit personnel during training for operations.

The Chindits were disbanded in February 1945. Several of the brigade headquarters and many of the veterans of the Chindit operations were reformed and merged into 44th Airborne Division, while the force headquarters and signals units formed the core of XXXIV Indian Corps.

In October 1939 shortly after the outbreak of war the Indian army numbered 205,038 men, initially little recruitment was undertaken as there was no expectation in London for India to contribute largely to a European war and the army grew to around 220,000 by the end of 1939 and by mid-1940 to 228,000 mostly from the &#x27;martial races&#x27; namely the Gurkhas and Sikhs. This policy of small increase and of Indian non-commitment was rapidly overturned following the fall of France, London quickly called for the rapid expansion of the Indian army and the army duly grew doubling to 456,000 by the end of 1940 and to 912,000 by the end of 1941 then a further growth to over 1,577,000 by the end of 1942 further growth continued though at a diminishing rate. The total army including auxiliary forces peaked at 2,250,000 men. This was an impressive expansion of military force in a rapid period brought about solely by volunteers and not conscription. However, the British remained prejudiced and favoured their martial race categorisation of troops and deemed that of the 390,000,000 Indians, slightly less than 13,000,000 were intelligent and had the aptitude and sense to become a modern soldier for a modern war, thus only 3% of the adult male population was recruited.

The British recruitment policy however began to break down by mid 1942 as the martial races who were considered the most loyal and able fighters began to not volunteer in the same numbers due to rising demands for labour and higher profit in agriculture. Accordingly, recruits were sourced from beyond the martial races particularly Madras which grew from 3% of the pre-war army to 17% of the wartime army, though they joined not out of patriotism or loyalty but economic necessity as inflation caused by mass printing of money leading to rising prices. This is true especially of the Bengali recruits, whose wages were vastly reduced by inflation. The growth achieved by 1942 proved difficult to maintain as even the martial races of the dogra, Muslim, Sikh, Punjabi and Pathan struggled to fill existing units, though they continued to constitute the bulk of the frontline forces as the non-martial recruits were relegated to rear areas and auxiliary functions. By 1945 the martial races constituted 95% of the infantry, almost all of the armoured formations, artillery formations and air defence formations.

==Armies==
The Indian Army supplied formations for the following British Empire and Commonwealth armies:

===Eighth===
The Eighth Army was formed from the Western Desert Force in September 1941, under the command of Lieutenant General Sir Alan Cunningham. Over time, the Eighth Army would be commanded by Generals Neil Ritchie, Claude Auchinleck and Bernard Montgomery. In the early years of the war, the Eighth Army suffered from poor leadership and repeated reversals of fortune until the Second Battle of El Alamein when it advanced across Libya into Tunisia.

===Ninth===
The Ninth Army was formed on 1 November 1941 with the re-designation of the Headquarters of the British Troops in Mandate Palestine and Transjordan. It controlled British and Commonwealth land forces stationed in the eastern Mediterranean. Its commanders were General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson and Lieutenant-General Sir William George Holmes.

===Tenth===
The Tenth Army was formed in Iraq and from the major part of Paiforce after the Anglo-Iraqi War. It was active in 1942–1943, under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Edward Quinan, and consisted of the III Corps and the XXI Indian Corps. Its main task was the maintenance of the lines of communication to the Soviet Union from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian and the protection of the South Persian and Iraqi oilfields that supplied Britain with all its non American sourced oil.

===Twelfth===
The Twelfth Army was reformed in May 1945, to take control of operations in Burma from the Fourteenth Army. The army Headquarters was created by re-designating the Headquarters of the XXXIII Indian Corps, under Lieutenant-General Sir Montagu Stopford.

===Fourteenth===
The Fourteenth Army was a multinational force comprising units from Commonwealth countries, many of its units were from the Indian Army as well as British units and there were also significant contributions from 81st, 82nd and 11th African divisions. It was often referred to as the &quot;Forgotten Army&quot; because its ongoing operations in the Burma Campaign were largely overlooked by the contemporary press, as the War in Europe drew to a close and even after Victory in Europe (VE), when people took the view the war was over everywhere. It still remained more obscure than those of the corresponding formations in Europe long after the war. The Fourteenth Army was formed in 1943, under the command of Lieutenant General William Slim and was the largest Commonwealth Army during the war, with nearly a million men by late 1944. At various times, four corps were assigned to the army: IV Corps, XV Indian Corps, XXXIII Indian Corps and the XXXIV Indian Corps.

===Eastern===
The Eastern Army (India) was formed from Eastern Command in 1942. It served as the rear area command for the Twelfth and Fourteenth Armies.
Units being rested or reforming would be posted to this command, as would newly-formed or newly-posted units, being prepared for active service. It provided the training bases and depots, the equipment stores and the lines of communication (LOC) to headquarters. In addition, it provided force protection for the front-line forces, cushioning them from any domestic unrest and from any enemy attack from the rear. Its Commanders-in-Chief included Broad, Irwin and Giffard.

===Southern===
The Southern Army was formed from Southern Command in 1942, and disbanded in August 1945. Mostly a British formation used on internal security and for units out of the front line. The 19th Indian Infantry Division was one of its units from 1942 to 1944.

===North Western===
The North Western Army was formed from North Western Command in April 1942, formed to guard the North West Frontier it controlled the Kohat, Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Baluchistan and Waziristan Districts.

==Middle East and Africa==

===North Africa===
Just before the declaration of war, one Indian infantry brigade was sent to reinforce the British garrison in Egypt. In October 1939, a second brigade was sent; they were grouped together as the 4th Indian Infantry Division. By March 1940, two additional brigades and a divisional headquarters had been sent to Egypt; these became the 5th Indian Infantry Division.

Operation Compass (4th Indian and 7th Armoured Division) was the first major Allied military operation of the Western Desert Campaign during the Second World War. It resulted in British and Commonwealth forces pushing across a great stretch of Libya and capturing almost all of Cyrenaica, 115,000 Italian soldiers, hundreds of tanks and artillery pieces and more than 1,100 aircraft with very few casualties of their own.

The Allies&#x27; success against the Italians forced the Germans to reinforce North Africa. The Afrika Corps commanded by Erwin Rommel attacked in March 1941. The 3rd Indian Motor Brigade, fought a delaying battle at Meikili on 6 April, which allowed the 9th Australian Division to safely withdraw to Tobruk.

Operation Battleaxe (4th Indian and 7th Armoured) in June 1941 had the goal of clearing eastern Cyrenaica of German and Italian forces; one of the main benefits of this would be the lifting of the Siege of Tobruk. The operation did not succeed losing over half of their tanks on the first day and only achieved victory at one out of three thrusts. On the second day, they achieved mixed results, being pushed back on their western flank but repelled a significant German counter-attack in their centre. On the third day, the British narrowly avoided outright disaster by successfully withdrawing just prior to a German encircling movement which would have cut them off from retreat.

Operation Crusader (4th Indian, 7th Armoured, 1st South African, 2nd New Zealand and 70th British divisions) between 18 November–30 December 1941. The initial plan was to destroy the Axis armoured force before advancing its infantry. 7th Armoured were heavily defeated by the Afrika Korps at Sidi Rezegh. Rommel&#x27;s subsequent advance of his armoured divisions to the Axis fortress positions on the Egyptian border failed to find the main body of the Allied infantry, which had bypassed the fortresses and headed for Tobruk, so Rommel had to withdraw his armoured units to support the fighting at Tobruk. Despite achieving some tactical successes at Tobruk, the need to preserve his remaining forces prompted Rommel to withdraw his army to the defensive line at Gazala, west of Tobruk, and then all the way back to El Agheila.

4th Division left the desert for Cyprus and Syria in April 1942. By May 1942, their 11th Brigade had returned attached to the 5th Indian fighting south of Tobruk. Their 5th Brigade returned in June 1942, and fought at Mersa Matruh. The 10th Indian Infantry Division arrived from Syria, in time to take part in the Battle of Gazala May–June 1942, then held the Axis forces for 72 hours, in the First Battle of El Alamein permitting Eighth Army to safely withdraw.
HQ 4th Division returned for the Second Battle of El Alamein, holding Ruweisat Ridge at the centre of the Eighth Army&#x27;s line, made a mock attack and two small raids intended to deflect attention to the centre of the front.

Operation Pugilist (4th Indian, 2nd New Zealand and 50th Northumbrian divisions) was an operation in the Tunisian Campaign The object of was to destroy the Axis forces in the Mareth Line, and to capture Sfax. Pugilist itself was indecisive and failed to make a decisive breakthrough. It did, however, establish an alternative route of attack and thus laid the ground for Supercharge II, an outflanking manoeuvre via the Tebaga Gap.

===East Africa===

The Italian conquest of British Somaliland started on 3 August 1940, the 3/15th Punjab Regiment were amongst the forces on hand and they were quickly reinforced from Aden by the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment on 7 August. After the Battle of Tug Argan, the British force was forced to withdraw, the 3/15th Punjab forming part of the rearguard. By 19 August, the British and Indian battalions were evacuated to Aden. British ground losses were 38 killed, 102 wounded, and 120 missing, compared to Italian casualties of 465 killed, 1,530 wounded, and 34 missing.

In December 1940, the 4th Indian Infantry Division was rushed from Egypt to join the 5th Indian Infantry Division in the Sudan. From February to April 1941, the Indian 4th and 5th Infantry Divisions took part in the Battle of Keren, By the end of the campaign, the Italian forces had been cleared from Eritrea and Abyssinia 220,000 of them becoming prisoners of war.

===Iraq and Persia===
In 1941, forces were required to participate in the Anglo-Iraqi War, to safeguard the overland supply route to the Soviet Union. In April, the 8th Indian Infantry Division landed at Basra and marched on Baghdad securing Iraq for the Allied cause from the pro German Rashid Ali. Operation Barbarossa the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, placed the Persian oil fields in danger from the advancing German Army. In August 1941, the Indian 8th and 10th Infantry Divisions invaded southern Persia to secure the oil installations.

The 8th and 10th Indian Infantry Divisions, 2nd Indian Armoured Brigade and the British 4th Cavalry Brigade were all involved in the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran (August–September 1941), which was rapid and conducted with ease. From the south, two battalions from 8th Divisions 24th Indian Brigade making an amphibious crossing of the Shatt al-Arab, captured the petroleum installations at Abadan. The 8th Division then advanced from Basra towards Qasr Shiekh and by 28 August had reached Ahvaz when the Shah ordered hostilities to cease. Further north, eight battalions of British and Indian troops under Major-General William Slim advanced from Khanaqin into the Naft-i-Shah oilfield and on towards the Pai Tak Pass, leading towards Kermanshah and Hamadan. The Pai Tak position was taken on 27 August after the defenders had withdrawn in the night; the planned assault on Kermanshah on 29 August was aborted when the defenders called a truce to negotiate surrender terms.

After hostilities had ended, the 2nd Indian Infantry Division, 6th Indian Infantry Division and 12th Indian Infantry Division all remained in the region on internal security duties.

===Syria and Lebanon===
The Indian Army supplied the 5th Brigade, 4th Indian Infantry Division which attacked from the south with the Australian I Corps and the 10th Indian Infantry Division which also had the 17th Indian Infantry Brigade, 8th Indian Infantry Division under command was part of Iraqforce attack northern and central Syria from the east. 5th Brigade took part in the Battle of Kissoué and the Battle of Damascus, June 1941, and 10th Division the Battle of Deir ez-Zor in July.

==South-East Asia==

===Hong Kong===

The Japanese Army attacked Hong Kong on 8 December 1941, less than eight hours after their attack on Pearl Harbor. The garrison comprised British, Indian and Canadian battalions plus local Hong Kong Chinese reservists. The Indian Army troops were the 5/7th Rajput Regiment and the 2/14th Punjab Regiment. The garrison held out for 18 days before being forced to surrender.

===Malaya===
As in Egypt, the Indian Army dispatched one infantry brigade to Malaya just before the start of the war. By 1941, all training and equipment was geared to fight in North Africa and the Middle East and the forces in Burma and Malaya had been depleted to supply reinforcements to the forces in the west.
As a result, in the spring of 1941, the 9th Indian Infantry Division was sent to Malaya.

On 8 December, the Japanese Army attacked the Malayan peninsula, the defenders now included the Indian 9th and the 11th Indian Infantry Divisions, the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade and a number of independent battalions and units of Imperial Service Troops, in the III Indian Corps. The 11th Indian division fought the Battle of Jitra 11–13 December, the Battle of Kampar 30 December – 2 January, the Battle of Slim River 6–8 January 1942. The 44th Indian Infantry Brigade and the 45th Indian Infantry Brigade had arrived as reinforcement in January 1942. The 45th Brigade fought the Battle of Muar 14–22 January, of the 4,000 men in the brigade only 800 survived the battle.

===Singapore===
The Battle of Singapore 31 January – 15 February ended with the capture of 9th and 11th Indian Divisions and the 12th, 44th and 45th brigades and 55,000 Indian servicemen were made prisoners of war.

During the battle for Singapore, Indian units fought in the Battle of Bukit Timah and the Battle of Pasir Panjang.

===Borneo===

In late 1940, Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham ordered the 2nd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment and a heavy gun battery from the Hong Kong-Singapore Royal Artillery, to be positioned at Kuching, the capital of Sarawak. The battalion, which numbered about 1,050 men, was commanded by British Lieutenant Colonel C.M. Lane and was a part of &quot;SARFOR&quot; (Sarawak Force). Some 230 men of the battalion were killed or captured in the defence of the airfield before the fall of the city to the Japanese on 24 December 1941. Two days later, SARFOR was disbanded; on the 27th, the remainder of the Punjabi force crossed into Dutch Borneo, where Lane placed them under Dutch command. The men continued to resist the Japanese in the dense jungle of southern Borneo until 1 April, when they finally surrendered. Arthur Percival, GOC Malaya, later called their resistance &quot;a feat of endurance which assuredly will rank high in the annals of warfare. It says much for the morale of this fine battalion that it remained a formed and disciplined body to the end.&quot;

===Return to Malaya and Singapore===
25th Indian Infantry Division with 3 Commando Brigade, in January 1945 the Division took part in the first large scale Amphibious Operations in South East Asia, They were ferried across the Four Mile wide Mayu Estuary to land on the Northern beaches of Akyab Island, in the course of the following weeks they occupied Myrbaw and Ruywa. In April 1945. the division was withdrawn to South India to prepare for Operation Zipper the invasion of Malaya, having been chosen for the assault landing role. Although hostilities then ceased, the operation proceeded as planned, 23rd and 25th Divisions was the first formations to land in Malaya 9 September, and then accepting the surrender of the Japanese Army.

Operation Tiderace (5th Indian Infantry Division) commenced when troops set sail from Trincomalee and Rangoon on 21 August for Singapore. The fleet arrived in Singapore on 4 September 1945, and Japanese forces in Singapore officially surrendered to Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Command on 12 September 1945.

===Post-Japanese surrender===
After the Japanese surrender, some divisions were sent to disarm the Japanese and assist the local governments. The 7th Division moved to Thailand, where it disarmed the Japanese occupying army, and liberated and repatriated Allied prisoners of war. The 20th Division was sent to French Indochina, occupying the southern part of the colony. There were several battles with the Viet Minh, who were intent on achieving independence. The 23rd Division was sent to Java, where the end of the war had brought widespread disorder and conflict between the Dutch colonial regime and pro-independence movements.

==Burma==

At the same time, the 9th Division was sent to reinforce Malaya, in the spring of 1941, an infantry brigade was sent to reinforce Burma followed by a second brigade later in the year. On 8 December, the Japanese Army invaded Burma from Siam. Withdrawing to India, the last British and Indian escaped from Burma in July 1942.

===Japanese conquest of Burma===

The Battle of Bilin River was fought in February 1942, by the 17th Indian Infantry Division. The 17th Division held the Japanese at the Bilin River for two days of close-quarters jungle fighting. The Japanese tactics were to outflank, and eventually with encirclement imminent, they were given permission to fall back. The division disengaged under cover of darkness and began a retreat along the dusty track to the Sittang bridge. The Battle of Sittang Bridge followed after which 17th Division lost most of its artillery, vehicles and other heavy equipment. Its infantry manpower was 3,484 just over 40% of its establishment, though it was already well under-strength before the battle started. The Battle of Pegu in March was carried out by the surviving elements of the 17th Division and the 7th British Armoured Brigade, which had just arrived from the Middle East. In April, the Battle of Yenangyaung was fought between the 7th Armoured Brigade, 48th Indian Infantry Brigade and 1st Burma Division for control of the Yenangyaung oil fields. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties during the battle, but the Allied forces were too weak to hold the oil fields and had to retreat to the north. The fighting retreat to India, was successfully completed in May just before the monsoons would have cut them off. Approximately 12,000 of the 40,000 Indian prisoners of war who were captured either during the Malayan campaign or surrendered at Singapore were led by Mohan Singh as the First Indian National Army which was dissolved in December 1942.

===Burma campaign 1943===

The Arakan campaign, which began in December 1942, conducted by what at the time was an improvised formation 14th Indian Infantry Division was a failure. The average British and Indian soldier was not properly trained for fighting in jungle, which together with repeated defeats adversely affected morale. This was exacerbated by poor administration in the rear areas. Drafts of reinforcements sent to replace casualties were found in some cases to have not even completed basic training. There were also questions asked about the ability of the Indian Army&#x27;s high command, which led to the creation of the position of Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Command, leaving the army high command to concentrate on internal security and administration. There was continual patrol activity and low-key fighting south of Imphal, but neither army possessed the resources to mount decisive operations. 17th Division held positions around the town of Tiddim south of Imphal, and skirmished with units of the 33rd Japanese Division. The Japanese had a shorter and easier supply line from the port of Kalewa on the Chindwin River and had the upper hand for most of 1942 and 1943.

===Burma campaign 1944===
The Battle of the Admin Box (5th, 7th and 26th Indian, 81st (West Africa) Division, 36th British Division) in February, came after a limited allied offensive. The Japanese had infiltrated the widely dispersed lines of the 7th Division, and moved north undetected crossed the Kalapanzin River and swung west and south, and attacked the HQ of the 7th Division. The forward divisions were ordered to dig in and hold their positions rather than retreat, while the reserve divisions advanced to their relief. On the ground, the fighting for the Admin Box was severe and Japanese fire caused heavy casualties in the crowded defences and twice set ammunition dumps on fire. However, all attempts to overrun the defenders were thwarted by the tanks of the 25th Dragoons. Although Allied casualties were higher than the Japanese, the Japanese had been forced to abandon many of their wounded to die. For the first time in the Burma Campaign, the Japanese tactics had been countered and turned against them and British and Indian soldiers had held and defeated a major Japanese attack.

The Battle of Imphal and the Battle of Sangshak (17th, 20th, 23rd Indian Divisions, 50th Indian Parachute Brigade and 254th Indian Tank Brigade) took place in the region around the city of Imphal, the capital of the state of Manipur in North-East India from March until July 1944. Japanese army and the Indian National Army attempted to destroy the Allied forces at Imphal and invade India, but were driven back into Burma with heavy losses.

The Battle of Kohima (50th Indian Parachute Brigade and 5th, 7th Indian and 2nd British Divisions) was the turning point of the Japanese U Go offensive. The Japanese attempted to capture Kohima ridge, a feature which dominated the road by which the major British and Indian troops at Imphal were supplied. British and Indian reinforcements counter-attacked to drive the Japanese from the positions they had captured. The Japanese abandoned the ridge, but continued to block the Kohima-Imphal road. From 16 May to 22 June, the British and Indian troops pursued the retreating Japanese and reopened the road. The battle ended on 22 June when British and Indian troops from Kohima and Imphal met at Milestone 109.

===Burma campaign 1945===
The Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay (5th, 7th, 17th, 19th, and 20th Indian divisions, 2nd British Division, and 254th and 255th Indian Tank Brigades) between January and March 1945, were decisive battles near the end of the Burma Campaign. Despite logistical difficulties, the Allies were able to deploy large armoured and mechanised forces in Central Burma, and also possessed air supremacy. Most of the Japanese forces in Burma were destroyed during the battles, allowing the Allies to later recapture the capital, Rangoon, and reoccupy most of the country with little organised opposition.

The Battle of Ramree Island (26th Indian Infantry Division) was fought for six weeks during January and February 1945, as part of the XV Indian Corps 1944–45 offensive on the Southern Front of the Burma Campaign. Ramree Island lies off the Burma coast and was captured along with the rest of Southern Burma, during the early stages of the Campaign, by the rapidly advancing Imperial Japanese Army in 1942. In January 1945 the Allies were able to launch attacks to retake Ramree and its neighbour Cheduba, with the intention of building sea-supplied airbases on them.

Operation Dracula and the Battle of Elephant Point (5th and 17th Infantry, and 44th Indian Airborne Division; 2nd and 36th British Divisions; and 255th Indian Tank Brigade) was the name given to an airborne and amphibious attack on Rangoon by British and Indian forces. When it was launched, the Imperial Japanese Army had already abandoned the city.

==Japan==

===British Commonwealth Occupation Force===
Indian Army units formed part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in occupied Japan. BCOF was responsible for supervising demilitarisation and the disposal of Japan&#x27;s war industries, as well as the occupation of the western prefectures of Shimane, Yamaguchi, Tottori, Okayama, Hiroshima and Shikoku Island.

==Europe==

===France===

Probably the most unusual posting of any unit of the Indian Army during World War II was in 1940, when four mule companies of the British Indian Army Service Corps joined the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. They were evacuated from Dunkirk with the rest of the BEF in May 1940, and were still stationed in England in July 1942.

===Italy===
The Allies landed in Italy on 9 September 1943. The 4th, 8th and 10th Indian Divisions and the 43rd Independent Gurkha Infantry Brigade were all involved during the campaign
In October 1943, the 8th Indian Division fighting on the Adriatic front reached the Barbara Line which was breached in early November. The 8th Division led the assault on the German defensive Bernhardt Line, crossed the Sangro River and advanced to just short of Pescara where Eighth Army halted to wait for better weather in the spring.

The 4th Indian Division took part in the second battle of Monte Cassino, In the final fourth battle of Monte Cassino on 11 May, on the Eighth Army front, XIII Corps had made two strongly opposed night crossings of the Rapido by the British 4th Division and 8th Indian Infantry Division. By 18 May, the Germans had withdrawn to their next line.

The Gothic Line formed the last major line of defence in the final stages of the war along the summits of the Apennines The Gothic Line was breached on both the Adriatic and the central Apennine fronts during the Battle of Gemmano in August (4th Indian Divisions last battle before moving to Greece). On the United States Fifth Army&#x27;s far right wing, on the right of the XIII Corps front, 8th Indian Division fighting across trackless ground had captured the heights of Femina Morta, and 6th British Armoured Division had taken the San Godenzo Pass on Route 67 to Forlì, both on 18 September. On 5 October, the 10th Indian Division, switched from British X Corps to British V Corps, had crossed the Fiumicino river high in the hills and turned the German defensive line on the river forcing the German Tenth Army units downstream to pull back towards Bologna.

In the 1945 spring offensive, the critical role of getting across the Senio, honeycombed with defensive tunnels and bunkers front and rear, was given to the 8th Indian Division, reprising the role they played crossing the Rapido in the final Battle of Monte Cassino. On 29 April 1945, the Germans signed an instrument of surrender; hostilities in Italy formally ceased on 2 May.

===Greece===
On 24 October 1944, the 4th Indian Infantry Division were shipped to Greece, to help stabilise the country after the German withdrawal. The plan called for the division to be dispersed in three widely scattered areas. The 7th Indian Brigade and Divisional troops were allocated Greek Macedonia, Thrace and Thessaly, with instructions to keep watch on the borders of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. The 11th Indian Brigade would garrison the towns of Western Greece and the Ionian islands. The 5th Indian Brigade would take over the Aegean area and the Cyclades, and would move into Crete when the enemy garrisons in that island capitulated.

On 3 December, the ELAS members of the Greek Government resigned. A general strike was declared, and police opened fire on demonstrators. In Italy, the 4th and 46th British Infantry Divisions were ordered to leave for Greece. On 15 January, a truce had been concluded in Athens, by the terms of which ELAS undertook to withdraw from the capital and Salonika and to occupy rural concentration areas. Except for isolated incidents, this truce ended operations in Greece.

==India==
The 14th Indian Infantry Division and the 39th Indian Infantry Division were converted to training formations in 1943, and remained in India till the end of the war. Other units that only served in India include the 32nd Indian Armoured Division and the 43rd Indian Armoured Division which never completed forming before being converted to the 44th Indian Airborne Division in 1943. The Assam-based 21st Indian Infantry Division was also broken up to form 44th Airborne in 1944. The 34th Indian Infantry Division provided the garrison for Ceylon, and remained there during the war, it was disbanded in 1945, never having seen active service.

==Victoria Cross==
Indian personnel received 4,000 awards for gallantry, and 31 Victoria Crosses. The Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest military decoration, which is, or has been, awarded for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; to members of the armed forces of the Commonwealth countries, and previous British Empire territories. The Victoria Cross is awarded for 

The following members of the Indian Army were recipients of the Victoria Cross in World War II;

===East African campaign awards===
* Second-Lieutenant Premindra Singh Bhagat, Corps of Indian Engineers
:During the pursuit of the enemy following the capture of Metemma on the night 31 January – 1 February 1941, for his persistence (over a period of 96 hours working from dawn to dusk) and gallantry, in personally supervising the clearing of 15 minefields.
* Subadar Richhpal Ram, 6th Rajputana Rifles (posthumous award)
:On 7 February 1941, at Keren, Eritrea, Richhpal Ram led a successful attack on the enemy and subsequently repelled six counter-attacks and then, without a shot left, brought the few survivors of his company back. Five days later, when leading another attack, his right foot was blown off, but he continued to encourage his men until he died.

===Malayan campaign awards===
* Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Edward Cumming, 12th Frontier Force Regiment
:On 3 January 1942, near Kuantan, Malaya, the Japanese made a furious attack on the battalion and a strong enemy force penetrated the position. Cumming, with a small party of men, immediately led a counter-attack and although all his men became casualties and he, himself, had two bayonet wounds in the stomach he managed to restore the situation sufficiently for the major portion of the battalion and its vehicles to be withdrawn. Later, he drove in a carrier, under very heavy fire, collecting isolated detachments of his men and was again wounded. His gallant actions helped the brigade to withdraw safely.

===Tunisian campaign awards===
* Company Havildar Major Chhelu Ram, 6th Rajputana Rifles (posthumous award)
:On the night of 19–20 April 1943, at Djebel Garci, Tunisia, despite being wounded took command of the company, leading them in hand-to-hand fighting. Wounded again, he continued rallying his men until he died.
* Subadar Lalbahadur Thapa, 2nd Gurkha Rifles
:On 5–6 April 1943, during the silent attack on Rass-es-Zouai, Tunisia, Lalbahadur Thapa, commanding two sections, made his first contact with the enemy at the foot of a pathway winding up a narrow cleft which was thickly studded with enemy posts. The garrison of the out-posts were all killed by the subadar and his men, by kukri or bayonet and the next machine-gun posts were dealt with similarly. This officer then continued to fight his way up the bullet-swept approaches to the crest where he and the riflemen with him killed four - the rest fled. This made advance by the whole division was made possible.

===Burma campaign awards===
* Captain Michael Allmand. 6th Gurkha Rifles (posthumous award)
** On 11 June 1944, when his platoon come within 20 yards of the Pin Hmi Road Bridge, the enemy opened heavy and accurate fire, inflicting severe casualties and forcing the men to seek cover. Captain Allmand, however, with the utmost gallantry charged on by himself, hurling grenades into the enemy gun positions and killing three Japanese himself with his kukrie. Inspired by the splendid example of their platoon commander the surviving men followed him and captured their objective. Two days later Captain Allmand, owing to casualties among the officers, took over command of the Company and, dashing 30 yards ahead of it through long grass and marshy ground, swept by machine gun fire, personally killed a number of enemy machine gunners and successfully led his men onto the ridge of high ground that they had been ordered to seize. Once again, on 23 June, in the final attack on the Railway Bridge at Mogaung, Captain Allmand, although suffering from trench-foot, which made it difficult for him to walk, moved forward alone through deep mud and shell-holes and charged a Japanese machine gun nest single-handed, but he was mortally wounded and died shortly afterwards.
* Major Frank Gerald Blaker 9th Gurkha Rifles (posthumous award)
** On 9 July 1944, Major Blaker was commanding a company which was held up during an important advance by close-range firing from medium and light machine-guns. The major went ahead of his men through very heavy fire and despite being severely wounded in the arm, located the machine-guns and charged the position alone. Even when mortally wounded, he continued to cheer on his men whilst lying on the ground. His fearless leadership inspired his men to storm and capture the objective.
* Naik Fazal Din, 10th Baluch Regiment (posthumous award)
** On 2 March 1945, during an attack, Naik Fazal Din&#x27;s section was held up by fire from the enemy bunkers, whereupon he personally attacked the nearest bunker and silenced it, then led his men against the other. Suddenly six Japanese, led by two officers wielding swords, rushed out and Naik Fazal Din was run through the chest by one of them. As the sword was withdrawn, the naik wrested it from the hands of its owner and killed him with it. Having killed another Japanese with the sword he waved it aloft, continuing to encourage his men before staggering back to make his report and collapsing.
* Havildar Gaje Ghale, 5th Gurkha Rifles
** During the period 24–27 May 1943, Havildar Gaje Ghale was in charge of a platoon of young soldiers engaged in attacking a strong Japanese position. Wounded in the arm, chest and leg he nevertheless continued to lead assault after assault, encouraging his men by shouting the Gurkha&#x27;s battle-cry. Spurred on by the irresistible will of their leader, the platoon stormed and captured the position which the havildar then held and consolidated under heavy fire, refusing to go to the Regimental Aid post until ordered to do so.
* Rifleman Bhanbhagta Gurung, 2nd Gurkha Rifles
** On 5 March 1945, his company became pinned down by an enemy sniper and were suffering casualties. As this sniper was inflicting casualties on the section, Rifleman Bhanbhagta Gurung, being unable to fire from the lying position, stood up fully exposed to the heavy fire and calmly killed the enemy sniper with his rifle, thus saving his section from suffering further casualties. The section advanced again but came under heavy fire once again. Without waiting for orders, Gurung dashed out to attack the first enemy fox-hole. Throwing two grenades, he killed the two occupants and without any hesitation rushed on to the next enemy fox-hole and killed the Japanese in it with his bayonet. He cleared two further fox-holes with bayonet and grenade. &quot;During his single-handed attacks on these four enemy fox-holes, Rifleman Bhanbhagta Gurung was subjected to almost continuous and point-blank Light Machine Gun fire from a bunker on the North tip of the objective.&quot; For the fifth time, Gurung &quot;went forward alone in the face of heavy enemy fire to knock out this position. He doubled forward and leapt on to the roof of the bunker from where, his hand grenades being finished, he flung two No. 77 smoke grenades into the bunker slit.&quot; Gurung killed two Japanese soldiers who ran out of the bunker with his Kukri, and then advanced into the cramped bunker and killed the remaining Japanese soldier. Gurung ordered three others to take up positions in the bunker. &quot;The enemy counter-attack followed soon after, but under Rifleman Bhanbhagta Gurung&#x27;s command the small party inside the bunker repelled it with heavy loss to the-enemy. Rifleman Bhanbhagta Gurung showed outstanding bravery and a complete disregard for his own safety. His courageous clearing of five enemy positions single-handed was in itself decisive in capturing the objective and his inspiring example to the rest of the Company contributed to the speedy consolidation of this success&quot;.
* Rifleman Lachhiman Gurung, 8th Gurkha Rifles
** On 12–13 May 1945, Rifleman Lachhiman Gurung was manning the most forward post of his platoon which bore the brunt of an attack by at least 200 of the enemy. Twice he hurled back grenades which had fallen on his trench, but the third exploded in his right hand, blowing off his fingers, shattering his arm and severely wounding him in the face, body and right leg. His two comrades were also badly wounded but the rifleman, now alone and disregarding his wounds, loaded and fired his rifle with his left hand for four hours, calmly waiting for each attack which he met with fire at point blank range. Afterwards, when the casualties were counted, it is reported that there were 31 dead Japanese around his position which he had killed, with only one arm.
* Jemadar Abdul Hafiz, 9th Jat Regiment (posthumous award)
** On 6 April 1944, Jemadar Abdul Hafiz was ordered to attack with his platoon a prominent position held by the enemy, the only approach to which was across a bare slope and then up a very steep cliff. The Jemadar led the assault, killing several of the enemy himself and then pressed on regardless of machine-gun fire from another feature. He received two wounds, the second of which was fatal, but he had succeeded in routing an enemy vastly superior in numbers and had captured a most important position.
* Lieutenant Karamjeet Singh Judge, 15th Punjab Regiment (posthumous award)
** On 18 March 1945, Lieutenant Karamjeet Singh Judge, a platoon commander of a company ordered to capture a cotton mill, dominated the battlefield by his numerous acts of gallantry. After eliminating ten enemy bunkers he directed one tank to within 20 yards of another and asked the tank commander to cease fire while he went in to mop up. While doing so he was mortally wounded.
* Rifleman Ganju Lama, 7th Gurkha Rifles
** On 12 June 1944,&#x27;B&#x27; Company was attempting to stem the enemy&#x27;s advance when it came under heavy machine-gun and tank machine-gun fire. Rifleman Ganju Lama, with complete disregard for his own safety, took his PIAT gun and, crawling forward, succeeded in bringing the gun into action within 30 yards of the enemy tanks, knocking out two of them. Despite a broken wrist and two other serious wounds to his right and left hands he then moved forward and engaged the tank crew who were trying to escape. Not until he had accounted for all of them did he consent to have his wounds dressed.
* Rifleman Tul Bahadur Pun, 6th Gurkha Rifles
** On 23 June 1944, during an attack on the railway bridge, a section of one of the platoons was wiped out with the exception of Rifleman Tul Bahadur Pun, his section commander and one other. The section commander immediately led a charge on the enemy position but was at once badly wounded, as was the third man. Rifleman Pun, with a Bren gun continued the charge alone in the face of shattering fire and reaching the position, killed three of the occupants and put five more to flight, capturing two light machine-guns and much ammunition. He then gave accurate supporting fire, enabling the rest of his platoon to reach their objective.
* Rifleman Agansing Rai, 5th Gurkha Rifles
** on 26 June 1944, under withering fire Agansing Rai and his party charged a machine-gun. Agansing Rai himself killed three of the crew. When the first position had been taken, he then led a dash on a machine-gun firing from the jungle, where he killed three of the crew, his men accounting for the rest. He subsequently tackled an isolated bunker single-handed, killing all four occupants. The enemy were now so demoralised that they fled and the second post was recaptured.
* Sepoy Bhandari Ram, 10th Baluch Regiment
** On 22 November 1944, Sepoy Bhandari Ram&#x27;s platoon was pinned down by machine-gun fire. Although wounded he crawled up to a Japanese light machine-gun in full view of the enemy and was wounded again, but continued crawling to within 5 yards of his objective. He then threw a grenade into the position, killing the gunner and two others. This action inspired his platoon to rush and capture the enemy position. Only then did he allow his wounds to be dressed.
* Lance Naik Sher Shah, 16th Punjab Regiment (posthumous award)
** On 19–20 January 1945, Lance Naik Sher Shah was commanding a left forward section of his platoon when it was attacked by overwhelming numbers of Japanese. He broke up two attacks by crawling right in among the enemy and shooting at point-blank range. On the second occasion he was hit and his leg shattered, but he maintained that his injury was only slight and when the third attack came, he again crawled forward engaging the enemy until he was shot through the head and killed.
* Naik Gian Singh, 15th Punjab Regiment
** On 2 March 1945, Naik Gian Singh who was in charge of the leading section of his platoon, went on alone firing his tommy gun, and rushed the enemy foxholes. In spite of being wounded in the arm, he went on, hurling grenades. He attacked and killed the crew of a cleverly concealed anti-tank gun, and then led his men down a lane clearing all enemy positions. He went on leading his section until the action had been satisfactorily completed.
* Naik Nand Singh, 11th Sikh Regiment
** On 11–12 March 1944, Naik Nand Singh, commanding a leading section of the attack, was ordered to recapture a position gained by the enemy. He led his section up a very steep knife-edged ridge under very heavy machine-gun and rifle fire and although wounded in the thigh, captured the first trench. He then crawled forward alone and, wounded again in the face and shoulder, nevertheless captured the second and third trenches.
* Havildar Parkash Singh, 8th Punjab Regiment
** On 6 January 1943, Havildar Parkash Singh drove his own carrier forward and rescued the crews of two disabled carriers under very heavy fire. Again on 19 January in the same area he rescued two more carriers which had been put out of action by an enemy anti-tank gun. He then went out yet again and brought to safety another disabled carrier containing two wounded men.
* Jemadar Prakash Singh Chib, 13th Frontier Force Rifles (posthumous award)
** On 16/17 February 1945, Jemadar Prakash Singh was commanding a platoon which took the main weight of fierce enemy attacks. He was wounded in both ankles and relieved of his command, but when his second-in-command was also wounded, he crawled back and took command of his unit again, directing operations and encouraging his men. He was wounded in both legs a second time but he continued to direct the defence, dragging himself from place to place by his hands. When wounded a third time and final time, he lay shouting the Dogra war-cry as he died, inspiring his company that finally drove off the enemy.
* Havildar Umrao Singh, Indian Artillery Regiment
** On 15–16 December 1944, Havildar Umrao Singh was a field gun detachment commander in an advanced section of the 30th Mountain Regiment, Indian Artillery, attached to the 81st West African Division. Singh&#x27;s gun was in an advanced position, supporting the 8th Gold Coast Regiment. After a 90-minute sustained bombardment from 75 mm guns and mortars, Singh&#x27;s gun position was attacked by at least two companies of Japanese infantry. Using a Bren light machine gun he directed the rifle fire of the gunners, holding off the assault, and was wounded by two grenades. A second wave of attackers killed all but Singh and two other gunners, but was also beaten off. The three soldiers had only a few bullets remaining, and these were rapidly exhausted in the initial stages of the assault by a third wave of attackers. Undaunted, Singh picked up a &quot;gun bearer&quot; (a heavy iron rod, similar to a crow bar) and used that as a weapon in hand-to-hand fighting. He was seen to strike down three infantrymen, before succumbing to a rain of blows. Six hours later, after a counterattack, he was found alive but unconscious near to his artillery piece, almost unrecognisable from a head injury, still clutching his gun bearer. Ten Japanese soldiers lay dead nearby. His field gun was back in action later that day.
* Subadar Ram Sarup Singh, 1st Punjab Regiment (posthumous award)
** On 25 October 1944, two platoons were ordered to attack a particularly strong enemy position. The platoon commanded by Subadar Ram Sarup Singh attained its objective, completely routing the enemy, and although the subadar was wounded in both legs he insisted on carrying on. Later, the enemy&#x27;s fierce counter-attack was only halted by Subadar Ram Sarup Singh&#x27;s dashing counter-charge in which he killed four of the enemy himself. He was again wounded, in the thigh, but continued to lead his men, killing two more of the enemy, until he was mortally wounded.
* Acting Subedar Netrabahadur Thapa, 5th Gurkha Rifles (posthumous award)
** On 25–26 June 1944, Acting Subedar Thapa was in command of a small isolated hill post at Bishenpur, Burma when the Japanese army attacked in force. The men, inspired by their leader&#x27;s example, held their ground and the enemy were beaten off, but casualties were very heavy and reinforcements were requested. When these arrived some hours later they also suffered heavy casualties. Thapa retrieved the reinforcements&#x27; ammunition himself and mounted an offensive with grenades and kukris, until he was killed.

===Italian campaign awards===
* Naik Yeshwant Ghadge, 5th Mahratta Light Infantry (posthumous award)
** On 10 July 1944, a rifle section commanded by Naik Yeshwant Ghadge came under heavy machine-gun fire at close range which killed or wounded all members of the section except the commander. Without hesitation Naik Yeshwant Ghadge rushed the machine-gun position, first throwing a grenade which knocked out the machine-gun and firer and then he shot one of the gun crew. Finally, having no time to change his magazine, he clubbed to death the two remaining members of the crew. He fell mortally wounded, shot by an enemy sniper.
* Rifleman Thaman Gurung, 5th Gurkha Rifles (posthumous award)
** On 10 November 1944, Rifleman Thaman Gurung was acting as a scout to a fighting patrol. It was undoubtedly due to his superb gallantry that his platoon was able to withdraw from an extremely difficult position without many more casualties than were in fact incurred and that some very valuable information was obtained which resulted in the capture of the feature three days later. The rifleman&#x27;s bravery cost him his life.
* Sepoy Ali Haidar, 13th Frontier Force Rifles
** On 9 April 1945, during the crossing of the Senio River, only Sepoy Ali Haidar and the two other men of his section managed to get across under heavy machine-gun fire. Then, while the other two covered him, the sepoy attacked the nearest strong point and, in spite of being wounded, put it out of action. In attacking a second strong-point he was again severely wounded but managed to crawl closer, throw a grenade and charge the post; two of the enemy were wounded, the remaining two surrendered. The rest of the company were then able to cross the river and establish a bridgehead.
* Sepoy Namdeo Jadav, 5th Mahratta Light Infantry
** On 9 April 1945, Italy, when a small party were almost wiped out in an assault on the east floodbank of the river, Sepoy Namdeo Jadav carried two wounded men under heavy fire through deep water, up a steep bank and through a mine belt to safety. Then, determined to avenge his dead comrades, he eliminated three enemy machine-gun posts. Finally, climbing on top of the bank he shouted the Maratha war cry and waved the remaining companies across. He not only saved many lives but enabled the battalion to secure the bridgehead and ultimately to crush all enemy resistance in the area.
* Sepoy Kamal Ram, 8th Punjab Regiment
** On 12 May 1944, the company advance was held up by heavy machine-gun fire from four posts on the front and flanks. The capture of the position was essential and Sepoy Kamal Ram volunteered to get round the rear of the right post and silence it. He attacked the first two posts single-handed, killing or taking prisoner the occupants and together with a Havildar he then went on to complete the destruction of a third. His outstanding bravery unquestionably saved a difficult situation at a critical period of the battle.
* Rifleman Sher Bahadur Thapa, 9th Gurkha Rifles (posthumous award)
** On 18–19 September 1944, when a company of the 9th Gurkha Rifles encountered bitter opposition from a German prepared position, Rifleman Sher Bahadur Thapa and his section commander, who was afterwards badly wounded, charged and silenced an enemy machine-gun. The rifleman then went on alone to the exposed part of a ridge where, ignoring a hail of bullets, he silenced more machine-guns, covered a withdrawal and rescued two wounded men before he was killed.

==George Cross==
The George Cross (GC) is the counterpart of the Victoria Cross and the highest gallantry award for civilians as well as for military personnel in actions which are not in the face of the enemy, or for which purely military honours would not normally be granted.
The following members of the Indian Army were recipients of the George Cross in World War II;
* Captain Mateen Ahmed Ansari, 7th Rajput Regiment (posthumous award)
** He was taken prisoner by the Japanese after they invaded Hong Kong in December 1941. After the Japanese discovered that he was related to the ruler of one of the Princely States, they demanded that he renounce his allegiance to the British and foment discontent in the ranks of Indian prisoners in the prison camps. He refused and was thrown into the notorious Stanley Jail in May 1942, where he was starved and brutalised. When he remained firm in his allegiance to the British on his return to the prison camps, he was again incarcerated in Stanley Jail, where he was starved and tortured for five months. He was then returned to the original camp, where he continued his allegiance to the British, and even helped to organise escape attempts by other prisoners. He was sentenced to death, with over 30 other British, Chinese and Indian prisoners and beheaded on 20 October 1943.
* Sowar Ditto Ram, Central India Horse (posthumous award)
** Sowar Ditto Ram was posthumously awarded the George Cross for his gallantry in helping a wounded comrade on 23 July 1944 at Monte Cassino in Italy.
* Lieutenant Colonel Mahmood Khan Durrani, 1st Bahawalpur Infantry, Indian State Forces
** At the time of his capture, he was attached to the 1st Bahawalpur Infantry of the Indian State Forces. During the retreat in Malaya in 1942, he and small party of soldiers managed to evade capture for three months before their location was betrayed to the Japanese sponsored Indian Nationalist Army. He refused to co-operate with the INA and worked to counter their attempts to infiltrate agents into India. In May 1944, he was arrested and systematically starved and tortured by the Japanese, but refused to betray his comrades. He was then handed over by the Japanese to the INA where he was again brutally tortured and, at one point, sentenced to death. He stood firm throughout his ordeal.
* Lance Naik Islam-ud-Din, 9th Jat Regiment (posthumous award)
** 12 April 1945 in Pyawbwe, Central Burma when he sacrificed his own life to save others.
* Naik Kirpa Ram 13th Frontier Force Rifles (posthumous award)
** During a field firing exercise at a rest camp in Bangalore, a rifle grenade misfired and fell only eight yards from his section. The twenty-eight-year-old soldier rushed forward, shouting at the men to take cover and attempted to throw it to a safe distance. It exploded in his hand, wounding him fatally, but his self-sacrifice saved his comrades from harm.
* Havildar Abdul Rahman, 9th Jat Regiment (posthumous award)
** He was awarded the decoration for the gallantry he showed in attempting an air crash rescue on 22 February 1945 in Kletek in Java.
* Lieutenant Subramanian, Queen Victoria&#x27;s Own Madras Sappers and Miners (posthumous award)
** Sacrificed his own life on 24 June 1944 by throwing himself over a mine to protect others from the blast.

==Aftermath==
World War II cost the lives of over 87,000 soldiers, air crews and mariners from the Indian Empire, This included 24,338 killed and 11,754 missing in action. the overwhelming majority being members of the Indian Army. Another 34,354 more were wounded,

Of the 79,489 Indian personnel who became prisoners of war (POWs), German and/or Italian forces held 15,000–17,000. Between 2,500 and 4,000 of these POWs subsequently enlisted in the Italian &quot;Battaglione Azad Hindoustan&quot; and/or German &quot;Indische Legion&quot;, with the intention of fighting the Allies. More than 40,000 Indian POWs captured by Japanese forces volunteered for the pro-Japanese Indian National Army (INA), which fought the Allies in Burma and north-east India. Out of 60,000 Indian POWs taken at the Fall of Singapore, 11,000 died in Japanese camps from disease, malnutrition, physical abuse, or overwork; many of these had been transported to New Guinea or the Solomon Islands, where they were used as forced labour by Japanese forces.

In late 1943, when Italy capitulated to the Allies, Indians were among tens of thousands of Allied POWs who escaped from, or were liberated from POW camps. During 1943 and 1944, 128 Indian POWs were repatriated from Germany in prisoner exchanges. More than 200 Indian POWs died in captivity in Europe. By 30 April 1945, only 8,950 Indian prisoners of war remained in German camps. The German &quot;Indische Legion&quot; saw little front-line action, suffered few casualties and many of its recruits were returned to POW camps. In July 1945, the British government reported that at least 1,045 members of the &quot;Legion&quot; had already been repatriated to India, or were being held for questioning in the UK, while about 700 remained at large in Europe.) Conversely, 2,615 of the POWs recruited by the INA were killed in action against the Allies or missing.

World War II was the last time the Indian Army fought as part of the British military apparatus, as independence and partition followed in 1947. On 3 June 1947, the British Government announced the plan for the partition of the sub–continent between India and Pakistan. On 30 June 1947, the procedure for the division of the armed forces was agreed upon. After partition, the Indian Army was divided between the armies of the newly independent states, the Indian Army and the Pakistan Army. Field Marshal Claude Auchinleck, then Commander-in-Chief, India, was appointed Supreme Commander to ensure smooth division of units, stores and so on. It was announced on 1 July 1947, that both countries would have operational control of their respective armed forces by 15 August 1947.

<doc id="475896" wikidata="Q320980" url="?curid=475896" title="Lucas van Leyden">
<text>Lucas van Leyden (1494 – 8 August 1533), also named either Lucas Hugensz or Lucas Jacobsz, was a Dutch painter and printmaker in engraving and woodcut. Lucas van Leyden was among the first Dutch exponents of genre painting and was a very accomplished engraver.
Lucas was the son of the painter Huygh Jacobsz. He was born, died, and was mainly active in Leiden.

Carel van Mander characterizes Lucas as a tireless artist, who as a child annoyed his mother by working long hours after nightfall, which she forbade not only for the cost of candlelight, but also because she felt that too much study was bad for his sensibilities. According to Van Mander, as a boy he only consorted with other young artists, such as painters, glass-etchers and goldsmiths, and was paid by the &quot;Heer van Lochorst&quot; (Johan van Lockhorst of Leiden, who died in 1510) a golden florin for each of his years at age 12 for a watercolor of St. Hubert.

==Paintings==

He learned basic techniques from his father and from Cornelis Engelbrechtsz, but his precocious originality was paramount. Where he learnt engraving is unknown, but he took advantage of the works of Marcantonio Raimondi, whose motifs are reworked in Lucas&#x27; engravings and paintings, and became highly skilled in that art at a very early age: the earliest known print by him (&quot;Mohammed and the Murdered Monk&quot;) dates from 1508, when he was perhaps only 14, yet reveals no trace of immaturity in inspiration or technique.

Seventeen paintings surely by Lucas survive, and a further twenty-seven are known from descriptions by Carel van Mander, from contemporary copies or from drawings of them made by Jan de Bisschop in the later 17th century. Max Friedländer described no clear pattern of stylistic development, in large part because Lucas&#x27; oeuvre was swelled and obscured by attributions since found unsustainable.

Four broad stages in his artistic development are characterized by Elise Lawton Smith as his early half-length figures (&quot;c&quot; 1506–1512), the development of his landscapes (&quot;c&quot; 1512–1520), the influence of Antwerp paintings (&quot;c&quot; 1521–25) and the late works (&quot;ca&quot; 1525–1531), where multiple figures are deployed against wooded landscapes, as in the &quot;Healing of blind man of Jericho&quot; (&quot;illustration&quot;).

Raimondi&#x27;s studies of nudes inspired van Leyden in his later work, particularly his altarpieces, in which he is an early Dutch adopter of the Italian-style nude figure. Two further artistic influences were Albrecht Dürer and Jan Gossaert. Indeed, he was friends with both, and Dürer drew van Leyden&#x27;s portrait when they met in 1521. Dürer&#x27;s mastery of engraving and Gossaert&#x27;s Romanist style both heavily influenced van Leyden&#x27;s work.


== Prints ==

Lucas&#x27;s print included secular subjects, and many depictions of famous Biblical scenes, including &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, &quot;The Virgin and Child on the Crescent&quot;, and &quot;The Holy Family&quot;.

=== The Power of Women Series ===
From 1513 to 1517, Lucas created a series of woodcuts called &quot;The Power of Women&quot;, which consisted of two large and small sets of prints. The series is one of a number of representations of the Power of Women theme, which was extremely popular in Renaissance art and literature. Artworks in the genre depict the traditional roles of men and women in inverse, with women dominating over men in various situations. The subjects illustrated often consist of legendary historical women who were considered to be virtuous heroines as well as women who were considered cunning, seductive, and manipulative of men. The purpose of the &quot;Power of Women&quot; theme was to demonstrate that even the strongest and wisest of men were not resistant to the sexuality of women.

==== Large Power of Women (1513—) ====
&quot;The Mouth of Truth&quot;: A woman kneels in front of the Emperor of Rome and places her hand in the mouth of a statue of a lion while a crowd observes in the background.

&quot;The Fall of Man&quot;: In the foreground, Eve stands to the left of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, around which a serpent is wrapped, and hands an apple to Adam, who sits to the right of the tree. In the background to the right, an angel drives Adam and Eve out of Eden.

&quot;Samson and Delilah:&quot; Delilah sits a bed of rocks while Samson lies sleeping in her lap. She holds his hair in one hand and cuts it with a knife.

&quot;Solomon&#x27;s Idolatry:&quot; King Solomon kneels in front of an idol of Moloch in the center foreground while one of his mistresses and a crowd of men observe him from behind.

&quot;Herod and Herodias&quot;: Herod and Herodias sit at a table while their daughter Salome approaches them, holding a plate bearing the head of St. John the Baptist.

&quot;The Poet Virgil Suspended in a Basket:&quot; Virgil is shown stranded in a basket hung on the side of a tower in the town square, with a jeering crowd below him.

==== Small Power of Women (1517—) ====
&quot;The Fall of Man&quot;: In the foreground, Adam and Eve are around the tree of knowledge of good and evil, with the serpent wrapped around the trunk and holding an apple. In the background, an angel drives Adam and Eve out of paradise.

&quot;Jael Killing Sisera&quot;: In the foreground, Jael hammers a tent peg into Sisera&#x27;s ear as he lies on the ground. In the middle ground on the right, Jael points out the foreground scene to a group of armed Israelites. In the background on the left, Sisera drinks from a goblet given to him by Jael.

&quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;: Same as woodcut of larger size. Delilah sits a bed of rocks while Samson lies sleeping in her lap. She holds his hair in one hand and cuts it with a knife.

&quot;Solomon&#x27;s Idolatry&quot;: Same as woodcut of larger size. King Solomon kneels in front of an idol of Moloch in the center foreground while one of his mistresses and a crowd of men observe him from behind.

&quot;Jezebel Promising Naboth&#x27;s Vineyards to King Ahab&quot;: Jezebel stands beside her husband King Ahab of Israel, who is lying on his bed in his room.

&quot;Herod and Herodias&quot;: In the foreground, Salome holds a plate bearing the head of St. John the Baptist in front of Herod and Herodias, who are sitting at a table. Through a window on the back wall, St. John the Baptist is seen being beheaded.
==Family==
In 1515, Lucas married Elisabeth van Boschhuysen, from a patrician Leiden family. The marriage remained childless. Lucas did have a daughter Marijtje, born in Leiden out of wedlock around 1512. This daughter Marijtje would later marry the painter Dammas Claesz de Hoij. In their offspring, the De Hoij family, one can find prominent artists throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

== Collections ==
Today, Lucas&#x27;s work is held in the permanent collections of several institutions worldwide, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the British Museum, the Princeton University Art Museum, the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Fralin Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Ashmolean Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, the Worcester Art Museum, the Clark Art Institute, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum.

<text>The Almanac of American Politics is a reference work published biennially by Columbia Books &amp; Information Services. It aims to provide a detailed look at the politics of the United States through an approach of profiling individual leaders and areas of the country. The first edition of the &quot;Almanac&quot; was published in 1972. The &quot;National Journal&quot; published biennial editions of the &quot;Almanac&quot; from 1984 through 2014. In 2015, Columbia Books &amp; Information Services became the publisher.

==Overview==
The &quot;Almanac&quot; is broken down alphabetically by state, with each congressional district in each state profiled separately. The information provided by the &quot;Almanac&quot; includes:
*Demographic information on each district, including income, racial distribution, and other statistics.
*Profiles of the Congressional representative from each district as well as each state&#x27;s Senators, including voting record on key votes, advocacy group ratings, etc.; profiles of governors are also included.
*Individually written profiles of each district, commissioned for the &quot;Almanac&quot;.
*In-depth profiles of every governor, Senator, and House member.
*Analysis of elections for Senate, House and governor races, and how those results shape the public policy debates in Congress and the nation.
*A breakdown of the votes cast in the last U.S. presidential election for all states and districts, including primaries.
*Campaign finance data on spending by all members of the U.S. Congress in their most recent election, including all-new listings of the “outside money” spent in those contests.
*Analysis of voter turnout in each state and congressional district for the last presidential and mid-term elections.
*More than 60 state and congressional district maps, the key votes cast by members of the House and Senate, and interest group ratings.

In addition, an overview look at each state is given, including prospects for the upcoming presidential election and demographic trends.

The 2014 and 2012 editions of the &quot;Almanac&quot; are both 1,838 pages long. The &quot;Almanac&quot; was first published in 1971; subsequent editions have appeared biennially since 1973. The main editors were originally Michael Barone, now a writer at the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot;; Grant Ujifusa; and Douglas Matthews. Matthews stopped contributing after the 1980 edition. Barone and Chuck McCutcheon authored the 2012 edition, and were joined by Sean Trende and Josh Kraushaar for the 2014 edition. The co-authors of the 2016 edition are Barone, Richard E. Cohen, Charlie Cook, and James A. Barnes.

<text>HMS &quot;Nabob&quot; (D77) was a escort aircraft carrier which served in the Royal Navy during 1943 and 1944. The ship was built in the United States as
the USS &quot;Edisto&quot; (CVE-41) (originally AVG-41 then later ACV-41) but did not serve with the United States Navy. In August 1944 the ship was torpedoed by the while participating in an attack on the . &quot;Nabob&quot; survived the attack, but upon returning to port, was considered too damaged to repair. The escort carrier remained in port for the rest of the war and was returned to the United States following it. &quot;Nabob&quot; is one of two Royal Navy escort carriers built in the United States which is listed as lost in action (both of which were damaged beyond repair, but returned) during World War II. The ship was sold for scrap by the United States but found a second life when purchased and converted for mercantile use under her British name, &quot;Nabob&quot;. Later renamed Glory, the ship was sold for scrapping in 1977.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Bogue&quot; class were larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American-built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. The &quot;Ruler&quot; type vessels were essentially a repeat version of the . Based on the Type C3 design, the &quot;Ruler&quot; class were acquired by the Royal Navy as part of Lend-Lease after delays in the construction of the , which the Royal Navy had intended to acquire. All the vessels in the class had a complement of 646 officers and ratings and an overall length of , a beam of at the waterline and total with a mean draught of . The escort carriers had a standard displacement of and a deep load displacement of . Propulsion was provided by one shaft turned by an Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbine powered by two Foster Wheeler boilers, rated at , which could propel the ship at maximum . The escort carrier could carry of fuel oil and had a maximum range of at or at maximum speed.

Aircraft operations were commanded from a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side of the ship. The flight deck was long and wide. The H4C hydraulic aircraft catapult was capable of launching aircraft at . To receive aircraft the ship was equipped with nine arrestor wires capable of taking aircraft at , backed up by three aircraft barriers. Two aircraft elevators accessed the below-deck hangar, with the forward elevator being long by wide and the aft elevator being 34 feet wide and 42 feet long with both capable of taking aircraft. Aircraft could be housed in the hangar below the flight deck. However, the sloping contour of the hangar combined with the elevator arrangement made handling and storage of aircraft difficult and time-consuming. The escort carriers could store of avgas. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of fighter and anti-submarine (ASW) aircraft, though up to 90 could be ferried.

Armament comprised two Mark 9 /51 calibre guns, eight twin-mounted 40 mm Bofors guns, fourteen twin-mounted 20 mm Oerlikon cannon and seven single-mounted 20 mm Oerlikon cannon. Since the escort carriers came as part of Lend-Lease, they retained their American radar systems, with the SG surface radar and the SK air search radar.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Edisto&quot; was laid down on 20 October 1942 at the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp yard in Tacoma, Washington. The ship was launched on 9 March 1943. &quot;Edisto&quot; was completed and transferred under Lend-Lease to the United Kingdom on 7 September 1943 prior to her commissioning as HMS &quot;Nabob&quot; with the pennant number D77 into the Royal Navy at Tacoma. The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) wanted to obtain experience with aircraft carriers before their acquisition of their own carriers and sought Admiralty permission to take over &quot;Nabob&quot;. However, due to Lend-Lease stipulations, the escort carrier could not be commissioned in any force but the Royal Navy. In the end a compromise was made whereby the crew would be Canadian while the vessel remained under Royal Navy control.

Following her commissioning, the ship travelled to Vancouver, to undergo modification to Royal Navy standards beginning on 1 November at Burrard Dry Dock. The conversion completed on 12 January and an arrangement was agreed upon where the crew of the ship would be drawn primarily from the RCN with the exception of the air component, which would be provided by the Fleet Air Arm. &quot;Nabob&quot; sailed to San Francisco in February under the command of Captain Nelson Lay of the RCN, where the escort carrier embarked 852 Naval Air Squadron equipped with Grumman Avenger torpedo bombers.

Intended for service as an ASW carrier, &quot;Nabob&quot; was assigned to the British Home Fleet. The ship sailed for New York City to collect a deck load of P-51 Mustangs for the United Kingdom. The mixed crew of British aircrew and engine room personnel with the rest Canadian, led to personnel issues. The entire crew received the lesser British rate of pay and used British food and disciplinary standards. This led to a near revolt among the Canadians and to desertions at a stopover at Norfolk, Virginia. This led Captain Lay to fly to Ottawa to demand Canadian standards of pay for the entire crew before the ship set sail again. His request was granted. The escort carrier arrived in British waters in April and after disembarking the aircraft, sailed to the River Clyde to undergo a refit to repair builder&#x27;s defects.

&quot;Nabob&quot; returned to service on 29 June, beginning work ups with 852 Squadron and joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow on 1 August. 856 Naval Air Squadron joined the ship that month. In August, &quot;Nabob&quot; participated in two operations off the Norwegian coast. The first, beginning on 10 August named Operation Offspring, saw the escort carrier paired with and . This became the largest mining operation by the Home Fleet during the war and 47 mines were dropped between Haarhamsfjord and Lepsorev by 852 and 842 Naval Air Squadrons. One of the Avenger aircraft was shot down. The second operation was air strikes against the (Operation Goodwood). &quot;Nabob&quot; was a member of Force 2 during Operation Goodwood, where her Grumman Wildcats of 852 Squadron flew combat air patrol over the carrier and her Avengers of 852 and 856 Naval Air Squadrons flew anti-submarine patrols. On 22 August, while the main force attacking &quot;Tirpitz&quot; prepared for another strike, the escort carriers went to refuel the destroyers. During these operations, &quot;Nabob&quot; was torpedoed by the German submarine in the Barents Sea. The torpedo impact made a hole , below the waterline on the starboard side aft. The stern sank before flooding could be controlled. Eventually the damage control parties effected enough repairs that the ship could make . Five days later she steamed into Scapa Flow under her own power but had lost 21 men.

At Scapa Flow, emergency work was done to keep the ship afloat, but &quot;Nabob&quot; was eventually judged not worth repairing due to a lack of shipyard capacity. The escort carrier was beached and abandoned on 30 September 1944 on the south shore of the Firth of Forth, then cannibalized for other ships but retained as part of the Reserve Fleet of Rosyth Command. On 10 October 1944, &quot;Nabob&quot; was paid off at Rosyth. She was returned to United States Navy at Rosyth on 16 March 1946. Never entering US service, the ship was sold on 26 October 1946.
&quot;Nabob&quot; was sold for scrapping in the Netherlands in September 1947. However, the vessel was resold and converted as the merchant &quot;Nabob&quot; of Norddeutscher Lloyd in 1951, entering service in 1952. In 1967 the ship&#x27;s registry changed to Panama and was the ship was renamed &quot;Glory&quot;. She was sold for scrap in Taiwan on 6 December 1977.

<text>Bruce Leslie McLaren (30 August 1937 – 2 June 1970) was a New Zealand racing driver, automotive designer, engineer and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . McLaren was runner-up in the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Cooper, and won four Grands Prix across 13 seasons. In endurance racing, McLaren won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Ford. He founded McLaren in 1963, who have since won nine World Constructors&#x27; Championship titles and remain the only team to have completed the Triple Crown of Motorsport.

Born and raised in Auckland, McLaren initially studied engineering at the University of Auckland before dropping out to focus on his motor racing career. Having entered his first hillclimbing event aged 14, he progressed to Formula Two in 1957, winning the New Zealand Championship the following year. His performance at the New Zealand Grand Prix attracted the attention of Jack Brabham, with whom he partnered at Cooper in having already debuted at the 1958 German Grand Prix, where he finished fifth in his Formula Two machinery. Aged 22, McLaren took his maiden win at the , becoming the then-youngest driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix, a record which stood for 44 years. Remaining at Cooper for , McLaren took a further win in Argentina—amongst several podiums—as he finished championship runner-up to teammate Brabham. After a winless season for Cooper, Brabham won the 1962 Monaco Grand Prix, finishing third in the championship to Graham Hill and Jim Clark. Cooper struggled for performance from to as Lotus, BRM and Ferrari dominated the championship, prompting McLaren to enter Formula One with his own team. McLaren founded Bruce McLaren Motor Racing in 1963, with whom he competed from until his death in . With the team, he won the in and finished third in the 1969 World Drivers&#x27; Championship. In June 1970, he died whilst testing the McLaren M8D at Goodwood, having achieved four wins, three fastest laps and 27 podiums in Formula One. 

Outside of Formula One, McLaren competed in nine editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans from to , winning in alongside Chris Amon in the Ford GT40 Mk II. He was also a two-time champion of the Canadian-American Challenge Cup in 1967 and 1969, driving his own M6A and M8B, and won the Tasman Series in 1964. His legacy has been cemented with the McLaren Group, whose achievements have included winning nine World Constructors&#x27; Championships, two Indianapolis 500s, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans in . McLaren was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1991.

==Early life==
Born in Auckland, New Zealand, Bruce McLaren attended Meadowbank Primary School. As a nine-year-old, he was diagnosed with Perthes disease in his hip that left his left leg shorter than the right.

His parents, Les and Ruth McLaren, owned a service station and workshop in Remuera Rd, Remuera, Auckland; Les McLaren had been a motorcycle racing enthusiast, but gave that up due to an injury before Bruce&#x27;s birth, and began racing cars at the club level instead. Bruce spent all of his free hours hanging around the workshop and developed his passion during his formative years. The former garage was first listed as a category 1 historic place by Heritage New Zealand in 2006.

After finishing high school at Seddon Memorial Technical College, McLaren enrolled in the School of Engineering at Auckland University, however he dropped out after motor racing success; his student record card was reported to have been ended with the words &quot;went motor racing&quot;.

===Etymology of McLaren surname===
In 1972, 2 years after Bruce&#x27;s death, his great-grandfather Ben McLaren celebrated his 100th birthday. After retrieving his birth certificate, it was found that his original surname was &#x27;Howie&#x27; rather than &#x27;McLaren&#x27;, which was thought to have been his original family name.

Howie, born in the Australian state of South Australia, had relocated to New Zealand and married a publican’s daughter whilst residing there. After returning to South Australia, he fell in love with, and subsequently began a relationship with Frances Moyle, a married woman with three children. Howie then again relocated to New Zealand with his new wife Frances, adopting the surname &#x27;McLaren&#x27;, a reference to the famous McLaren Vale wine region in South Australia (located 40 km (24 mi) south of Adelaide, the state&#x27;s capital city), to conceal his old life.

==Career==

Les McLaren restored an Austin 7 Ulster, which 14-year-old Bruce used in 1952 when he entered his first competition, a hillclimb at Muriwai, where he won the 750 cc class. Two years later, he took part in his first real race and showed promise. He moved up from the Austin to a Ford 10 special and an Austin-Healey, then a Formula Two (F2) Cooper-Climax sports racing car. He immediately began to modify, improve and master it, so much so that he was runner-up in the 1957–58 New Zealand championship series.

McLaren founded McLaren Automotive in 1963.

===Driving career===
====Grand Prix====

His performance in the New Zealand Grand Prix in 1958 was noticed by Australian driver Jack Brabham (who would later invite McLaren to drive for him). Because of his obvious potential, the New Zealand International Grand Prix organisation selected him for its &#x27;Driver to Europe&#x27; scheme designed to give a promising Kiwi driver year-round experience with the best in the world. McLaren was the first recipient, to be followed by others later including Denny Hulme.
McLaren went to Cooper and stayed seven years. He raced in F2 and was entered in the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring in which F2 and F1 cars competed together. He astounded the motor racing fraternity by being the first F2, and fifth overall, in a field of the best drivers in the world.

McLaren joined the Cooper factory F1 team alongside Jack Brabham in 1959 and won the 1959 United States Grand Prix at age 22 years 104 days, becoming the youngest ever GP winner (not including the Indianapolis 500) up to that time. This record would stand for more than four decades until Fernando Alonso&#x27;s victory at the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix. He followed that with a win in the Argentine Grand Prix, the first race of the 1960 Formula One season, and he would finish runner-up that season to Brabham.

McLaren won the 1962 Monaco Grand Prix, eventually finishing third in the championship that year. The next year, he founded Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Ltd, which remains in the Formula One championship simply as McLaren. McLaren continued to race and win in Coopers (including the New Zealand GP in 1964).

McLaren left Cooper at the end of 1965, and announced his own GP racing team, with co-driver and fellow Kiwi Chris Amon. Amon left in 1967 to drive for Ferrari. In 1968, McLaren was joined by another fellow Kiwi Denny Hulme, who had become world champion in 1967 with Brabham. McLaren took his fourth career win racing his own McLaren car at Spa in 1968, achieving the team&#x27;s first Grand Prix win. Hulme won twice in the McLaren-Ford.

The championship was also a success, with McLaren finishing third in the standings despite taking no wins. In tribute to his homeland, McLaren&#x27;s cars featured the &quot;speedy Kiwi&quot; logo.

==== Can-Am series ====
McLaren&#x27;s design flair and ingenuity were graphically demonstrated in powerful sports car racing. Just as the Can-Am began to become very popular with fans in Canada and the U.S., the new McLaren cars finished second twice, and third twice, in six races.

In 1967, they won five of six races and in 1968, four of six. The following year, McLarens proved unbeatable, winning all 11 races. In two races, they finished 1–2–3.

==== 24 Hours of Le Mans ====

In 1965, McLaren and co-driver Ken Miles raced a Ford GT40 in the 24 Hour Race at Le Mans. The car was leading after 45 laps but retired due to gearbox failure. In 1966, McLaren and co-driver Chris Amon won the race in a Ford GT40, in a Ford 1-2-3 finish. The Ken Miles-Denny Hulme entry crossed the line first but had travelled less distance due to the Le Mans style start.

=== Career as a constructor ===
McLaren was a competitive driver, but his legacy, the McLaren racing team, stems from his abilities as an analyst, engineer, and manager. In the early days of McLaren sports cars, McLaren was testing and as he drove out of the pits, he noticed the fuel filler access door was flapping up and down as he drove. The current aerodynamic thinking was that it should have been pressed more firmly in place as the speed of the car increased. Instead, it bounced more vigorously as the speed increased. Instantly, his frustration at the sloppy work changed and he had an insight. Stopping in the pits, he grabbed a pair of shears and started cutting the bodywork away behind the radiator. Climbing back in the car, he immediately began turning lap times faster than before.

Later, he explained, I was first angry that the filler door hadn&#x27;t been properly closed but then I began to wonder why it wasn&#x27;t being pressed down by the airflow. The only answer was that there had to be a source of higher pressure air under it than over it. From that session came the &quot;nostrils&quot; that have been a key McLaren design feature, including in the McLaren P1 road car.

McLaren noticed that his team&#x27;s cars were less innovative than the Chaparrals of rival driver/designer Jim Hall, but their superior reliability was rewarded by race and championship victories. That culture continued after his death and, when Ron Dennis bought the team, was reinforced by the lessons learned in his early career as a race mechanic.

==Death==
Bruce McLaren died aged 32 when his Can-Am car crashed on the Lavant Straight just before Woodcote corner at Goodwood Circuit in England on 2 June 1970. He had been testing his new McLaren M8D when the rear bodywork came adrift at speed. The loss of aerodynamic downforce destabilised the car, which spun, left the track, and hit a bunker used as a flag station.

Motorsport author Eoin Young said that McLaren had &quot;virtually penned his own epitaph&quot; in his 1964 book &quot;From the Cockpit&quot;. Referring to the death of teammate Timmy Mayer, McLaren had written:

He was buried at Waikumete Cemetery in Glen Eden. McLaren was survived by his wife, sisters and daughter, Amanda, who is a brand ambassador for McLaren and is one of the trustees of the Bruce McLaren Trust alongside her husband. His wife died in 2016.

<doc id="475904" wikidata="Q275475" url="?curid=475904" title="Kaa">
<text>Kaa is a fictional character from &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; stories written by Rudyard Kipling. In the books and many of the screen adaptations, Kaa is an ally of protagonist Mowgli, acting as a friend and trusted mentor or father figure alongside Bagheera and Baloo. However, Disney&#x27;s screen adaptations portray him as a secondary antagonist who attempts to eat Mowgli.

==Kipling&#x27;s Mowgli stories==
First introduced in the story &quot;Kaa&#x27;s Hunting&quot; in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Kaa is a huge and powerful snake, more than 100 years old and still in his prime. In &quot;Kaa&#x27;s Hunting&quot;, Bagheera and Baloo enlist Kaa&#x27;s help to rescue Mowgli when the man-cub is kidnapped by Bandar-log (monkeys) and taken to an abandoned human city called the Cold Lairs. Kaa breaks down the wall of the building in which Mowgli is imprisoned and uses his serpentine hypnosis to draw the monkeys toward his waiting jaws. Bagheera and Baloo are also hypnotized, but Mowgli is immune because he is human and breaks the spell on his friends.

Kaa is a symbol of cold-blooded power, both physically and psychologically.

The python despises poisonous snakes:

In &quot;The Second Jungle Book&quot;, Kaa appears in the first half of the story &quot;The King&#x27;s Ankus&quot;. After Kaa and Mowgli spend some time relaxing, bathing and wrestling, Kaa persuades Mowgli to visit a treasure chamber guarded by an old cobra beneath the same Cold Lairs. The cobra tries to kill Mowgli but its venom has dried up. Mowgli takes a jeweled item away as a souvenir, not realizing the trouble it will cause them, and Kaa departs.

In &quot;Red Dog&quot;, Mowgli asks Kaa for help when his wolf pack is threatened by rampaging dholes (the red dogs of the title). Kaa goes into a trance so that he can search his century-long memory for a stratagem to defeat the dogs:

With Kaa&#x27;s help Mowgli tricks the dholes into attacking prematurely. Kaa takes no part in the resulting battle (obliquely citing his loyalty to the boy rather than to the wolves, who often caused Mowgli grief) but Mowgli and the wolves finally kill all the dholes, though not without grievous losses.

In &quot;The Spring Running&quot;, as the teenage Mowgli reluctantly prepares to leave the jungle for the last time, Kaa tells Mowgli that &quot;it is hard to cast the skin&quot;, but Mowgli knows he must cast the skin of his old life in order to grow a new one. Kaa, Baloo and Bagheera sing for Mowgli in &quot;The Outsong&quot;, a poem and the ending of &quot;The Spring Running&quot;.

==Disney adaptations==
===1967 animated film and sequels===

Kaa appears in the 1967 animated adaptation by Walt Disney Productions. This version of Kaa is recast as a secondary antagonist, as Walt Disney felt audiences would not sympathize with a snake character. The voice of Kaa is provided by Sterling Holloway.

Kaa notices Mowgli in a tree one night and, rather than a serpentine dance, uses his hypnotic eyes to lull Mowgli into a deep sleep. Kaa nearly eats Mowgli before Bagheera awakens nearby, notices him, and slaps him, awakening Mowgli. Kaa retaliates by hypnotizing Bagheera, though Mowgli pushes Kaa out of the tree, making him unravel violently. Kaa encounters Mowgli again later in the film and once again, hypnotizes him in quick succession, this time using his song, &quot;Trust in Me&quot;, to lull him into a deep sleep, though he must hide him when Shere Khan asks him if he&#x27;s seen the boy. Shere Khan makes Kaa swear to tell him when he finds Mowgli and leaves, though Mowgli eventually wakes up and pushes Kaa out of the tree again.

Kaa is based on earlier characters from Disney films who comically and unsuccessfully attempt to eat the protagonist, including Tick-Tock the crocodile from &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and the wolf from &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;. Holloway provided Kaa with a hissing lisp while voicing him, which the Sherman Brothers incorporated into Kaa&#x27;s song &quot;Trust in Me&quot;.

Kaa returns in &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;, now voiced by Jim Cummings and has a smaller role. Kaa again tries and fails to eat Mowgli while he and Baloo are singing &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot;. After Mowgli inadvertently loses his prickly pear which lands on Kaa&#x27;s head, he angrily swears that he will &quot;never again associate with mancubs&quot; until he discovers Mowgli&#x27;s human friend Shanti. He hypnotizes her, and tries to eat her. Mowgli&#x27;s adoptive brother Ranjan thwarts him, causing him to fall down a cliff. Shere Khan finds Kaa again and asks him where Mowgli is, but Kaa lies that Mowgli is heading toward the swamp.

Kaa appears in the prequel series &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot;, where he is voiced by Jim Cummings. Kaa is seen as a snakeling who is still trying to master his hypnotic abilities, though he is cowardly. He is shown as a protagonist as opposed to the 1967 film, being friendly with the other cubs.

===1994 live-action film===
Kaa appears in the 1994 live-action adaptation. Most of his appearances were created using animatronics and computer-generated imagery, although an unnamed trained anaconda was also used.

Kaa is depicted as a far more menacing predator who lives in Monkey City with King Louie, guarding the orangutan&#x27;s treasure from intruders. Kaa attacks Mowgli and tries to drown him in a moat, but Mowgli wounds him with a dagger, forcing him to flee in a cloud of blood. Later, Louie summons Kaa again after Mowgli defeats Captain Boone and Boone begins stealing treasure; Kaa scares Boone into the moat, where the stolen treasure weighs him down to the bottom. Struggling to free himself, Boone sees the skeletal remains of Kaa&#x27;s former victims before being killed by the python.

===2016 live-action/CGI hybrid film===
Kaa appears in the 2016 remake of the 1967 film as an Indian python. This version of Kaa is female and voiced by Scarlett Johansson.

As in the 1967 film, Kaa is a villain desiring to hypnotize and eat Mowgli but like the 2003 sequel Kaa has a minor role. While Mowgli is hypnotized, Kaa reveals that he came to live in the jungle after Shere Khan killed his father and Bagheera found him, then describes to him the power of the dangerous &quot;red flower,&quot; fire. Kaa tries to devour Mowgli, but Baloo discovers her and rescues Mowgli.

Johansson described Kaa in an interview as a &quot;window into Mowgli&#x27;s past&quot; who uses storytelling to seduce and entrap Mowgli, noting that the way Kaa moves is &quot;very alluring&quot; and &quot;almost coquettish&quot;. Johansson also recorded a new version of &quot;Trust in Me&quot; for the film, saying the song was &quot;a strange melody. We wanted it to be a lullaby, but it has a very mysterious sound.&quot;

===Other appearances===
* A snake-like character resembling Kaa made a cameo during the final scene of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988) with the other Disney characters.
* Kaa has several cameo appearances in the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. He also appears as one of the main villains in the direct-to-video film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s House of Villains&quot;.
* In the 2022 short &quot;The Simpsons: Welcome to the Club&quot; Kaa is one of the Disney villains meeting Lisa Simpson, being voiced by Dawnn Lewis. This was the very first time the character appears in animation ever since &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;. In the end credits he was shown hypnotizing Homer Simpson in his coils.
* In the 2023 short &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot; Kaa is shown hypnotizing Clarabelle Cow, and Mickey Mouse tells Kaa to stop it, but Rapunzel knocks Kaa out cold with her frying pan. He is later seen at the end on the roof for the group photo with all the characters.
* Kaa appears as a playable character in the mobile game &quot;Disney Heroes Battle Mode&quot;.

==Other adaptations==
* In the 1989 Japanese anime series &quot;Jungle Book Shōnen Mowgli&quot;, Kaa is voiced by Keaton Yamada in the Japanese and Terrence Scammell in the English dub.
* In the 1967 &quot;Adventures of Mowgli&quot; Soviet cartoons, Kaa was voiced by Vladimir Ushakov in the Russian version, by Sam Elliott in the English dub, and by Adriano Celentano in the Italian dub.
* Kaa also made an appearance in the 1997 live-action film &quot;The Second Jungle Book: Mowgli &amp; Baloo&quot;. She appears as the snake charmer Karait&#x27;s pet female python.
* In the 2010 CGI animated television series, Kaa is given a more ferocious personality than in the books, but at the same time he is friends and allies with Mowgli, Bagheera, and Baloo.
* In &quot;&quot;, Kaa (Cate Blanchett) is a gigantic female Indian python with a calm but intimidating personality. She is a seer and with big, dark green and light yellow scales. She has more human facial features and full puffy lips. This version is a seer who takes a mentor-like role toward Mowgli and even saving his life at one point in the film.

<text>The first USS &quot;Estero&quot; (CVE-42) (previously AVG-42 then later ACV-42) was an escort aircraft carrier launched 22 March 1943 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation, Seattle, Washington, and sponsored by Mrs. C. N. Ingraham. She was reclassified CVE-42 on 15 July 1943. Completed in October 1943, she was transferred to the Royal Navy on 3 November 1943 and commissioned the same day as HMS &quot;Premier&quot;.

She served in World War II as an ASW escort carrier in European waters and additionally as a ferry carrier. She was returned to United States custody 2 April 1946, she was stricken on 21 May 1946 and was sold into merchant service as the &quot;Rhodesia Star&quot; (later renamed &quot;Hong Kong Knight&quot;) in 1947. She was scrapped in Taiwan in 1974.

==Design and description==

These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided a steam turbine, two boilers connected to one shaft giving 9,350 brake horsepower (SHP), which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

<text>In compiler construction, strength reduction is a compiler optimization where expensive operations are replaced with equivalent but less expensive operations. The classic example of strength reduction converts &quot;strong&quot; multiplications inside a loop into &quot;weaker&quot; additions – something that frequently occurs in array addressing.

Examples of strength reduction include replacing a multiplication within a loop with an addition and replacing exponentiation within a loop with a multiplication.

== Code analysis ==
Most of a program&#x27;s execution time is typically spent in a small section of code (called a hot spot), and that code is often inside a loop that is executed over and over.

A compiler uses methods to identify loops and recognize the characteristics of register values within those loops. For strength reduction, the compiler is interested in:
*Loop invariants: the values which do not change within the body of a loop.
*Induction variables: the values which are being iterated each time through the loop.

Loop invariants are essentially constants within a loop, but their value may change outside of the loop. Induction variables are changing by known amounts. The terms are relative to a particular loop. When loops are nested, an induction variable in the outer loop can be a loop invariant in the inner loop.

Strength reduction looks for expressions involving a loop invariant and an induction variable. Some of those expressions can be simplified. For example, the multiplication of loop invariant codice_1 and induction variable codice_2

c = 7;
for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
 y[i] = c * i;


can be replaced with successive weaker additions

c = 7;
k = 0;
for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
 y[i] = k;
 k = k + c;


== Strength reduction example ==

Below is an example that will strength-reduce all the loop multiplications that arose from array indexing address calculations.

Imagine a simple loop that sets an array to the identity matrix.
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
 for (j = 0; j &lt; n; j++)
 A[i,j] = 0.0;
 A[i,i] = 1.0;


===Intermediate code===

The compiler will view this code as
0010 ; for (i = 0, i &lt; n; i++)
0020 ; {
0030 r1 = #0 ; i = 0
0040 G0000:
0050 load r2, n ; i &lt; n
0060 cmp r1, r2
0070 bge G0001
0080
0090 ; for (j = 0; j &lt; n; j++)
0100 ; {
0110 r3 = #0 ; j = 0
0120 G0002:
0130 load r4, n ; j &lt; n
0140 cmp r3, r4
0150 bge G0003
0160
0170 ; A[i,j] = 0.0;
0180 load r7, n
0190 r8 = r1 * r7 ; calculate subscript i * n + j
0200 r9 = r8 + r3
0210 r10 = r9 * #8 ; calculate byte address
0220 fr3 = #0.0
0230 fstore fr3, A[r10]
0240
0250 r3 = r3 + #1 ; j++
0260 br G0002
0270 ; }
0280 G0003:
0290 ; A[i,i] = 1.0;
0300 load r12, n ; calculate subscript i * n + i
0310 r13 = r1 * r12
0320 r14 = r13 + r1
0330 r15 = r14 * #8 ; calculate byte address
0340 fr4 = #1.0
0350 fstore fr4, A[r15]
0360
0370 ; i++
0380 r1 = r1 + #1
0390 br G0000
0400 ; }
0410 G0001:
This expresses 2-dimensional array &quot;A&quot; as a 1-dimensional array of n*n size, so that whenever the high-level code expresses A[x, y] it will internally be A[(x*n)+y] for any given valid indices x and y.

=== Many optimizations ===

The compiler will start doing many optimizations – not just strength reduction. Expressions that are constant (invariant) within a loop will be hoisted out of the loop. Constants can be loaded outside of both loops—such as floating point registers fr3 and fr4. Recognition that some variables don&#x27;t change allows registers to be merged; n is constant, so r2, r4, r7, r12 can be hoisted and collapsed. The common value i*n is computed in (the hoisted) r8 and r13, so they collapse. The innermost loop (0120-0260) has been reduced from 11 to 7 intermediate instructions. The only multiply that remains in the innermost loop is line 0210&#x27;s multiply by 8.
0010 ; for (i = 0, i &lt; n; i++)
0020 {
0030 r1 = #0 ; i = 0
0050 load r2, n
0130 ; load r4, n killed; use r2
0180 ; load r7, n killed; use r2
0300 ; load r12, n killed; use r2
0220 fr3 = #0.0
0340 fr4 = #1.0
0040 G0000:
0060 cmp r1, r2 ; i &lt; n
0070 bge G0001
0080
0190 r8 = r1 * r2 ; calculate subscript i * n
0310 ; r13 = r1 * r2 killed; use r8 ; calculate subscript i * n
0090 ; for (j = 0; j &lt; n; j++)
0100 {
0110 r3 = #0 ; j = 0
0120 G0002:
0140 cmp r3, r2 ; j &lt; n
0150 bge G0003
0160
0170 ; A[i,j] = 0.0;
0200 r9 = r8 + r3 ; calculate subscript i * n + j
0210 r10 = r9 * #8 ; calculate byte address
0230 fstore fr3, A[r10]
0240
0250 r3 = r3 + #1 ; j++
0260 br G0002
0270 }
0280 G0003:
0290 ; A[i,i] = 1.0;
0320 r14 = r8 + r1 ; calculate subscript i * n + i
0330 r15 = r14 * #8 ; calculate byte address
0350 fstore fr4, A[r15]
0360
0370 ;i++
0380 r1 = r1 + #1
0390 br G0000
0400 }
0410 G0001:
There are more optimizations to do. Register r3 is the main variable in the innermost loop (0140-0260); it gets incremented by 1 each time through the loop. Register r8 (which is invariant in the innermost loop) is added to r3. Instead of using r3, the compiler can eliminate r3 and use r9. The loop, instead of being controlled by r3 = 0 to n-1, can be controlled by r9=r8+0 to r8+n-1. That adds four instructions and kills four instructions, but there&#x27;s one fewer instruction inside the loop.
0110 ; r3 = #0 killed ; j = 0
0115 r9 = r8 ; new assignment
0117 r20 = r8 + r2 ; new limit
0120 G0002:
0140 ; cmp r3, r2 killed ; j &lt; n
0145 cmp r9, r20 ; r8 + j &lt; r8 + n = r20
0150 bge G0003
0160
0170 ; A[i,j] = 0.0;
0200 ; r9 = r8 + r3 killed ; calculate subscript i * n + j
0210 r10 = r9 * #8 ; calculate byte address
0230 fstore fr3, A[r10]
0240
0250 ; r3 = r3 + #1 killed ; j++
0255 r9 = r9 + #1 ; new loop variable
0260 br G0002
Now r9 is the loop variable, but it interacts with the multiply by 8. Here we get to do some strength reduction. The multiply by 8 can be reduced to some successive additions of 8. Now there are no multiplications inside the loop.
0115 r9 = r8 ; new assignment
0117 r20 = r8 + r2 ; new limit
0118 r10 = r8 * #8 ; initial value of r10
0120 G0002:
0145 cmp r9, r20 ; r8 + j &lt; r8 + n = r20
0150 bge G0003
0160
0170 ; A[i,j] = 0.0;
0210 ; r10 = r9 * #8 killed ; calculate byte address
0230 fstore fr3, A[r10]
0240
0245 r10 = r10 + #8 ; strength reduced multiply
0255 r9 = r9 + #1 ; loop variable
0260 br G0002
Registers r9 and r10 (= 8*r9) aren&#x27;t both needed; r9 can be eliminated in the loop. The loop is now 5 instructions.
0115 ; r9 = r8 killed
0117 r20 = r8 + r2 ; limit
0118 r10 = r8 * #8 ; initial value of r10
0119 r22 = r20 * #8 ; new limit
0120 G0002:
0145 ; cmp r9, r20 killed ; r8 + j &lt; r8 + n = r20
0147 cmp r10, r22 ; r10 = 8*(r8 + j) &lt; 8*(r8 + n) = r22
0150 bge G0003
0160
0170 ; A[i,j] = 0.0;
0230 fstore fr3, A[r10]
0240
0245 r10 = r10 + #8 ; strength reduced multiply
0255 ; r9 = r9 + #1 killed ; loop variable
0260 br G0002
=== Outer loop ===

Back to the whole picture:
0010 ; for (i = 0, i &lt; n; i++)
0020 {
0030 r1 = #0 ; i = 0
0050 load r2, n
0220 fr3 = #0.0
0340 fr4 = #1.0
0040 G0000:
0060 cmp r1, r2 ; i &lt; n
0070 bge G0001
0080
0190 r8 = r1 * r2 ; calculate subscript i * n
0117 r20 = r8 + r2 ; limit
0118 r10 = r8 * #8 ; initial value of r10
0119 r22 = r20 * #8 ; new limit
0090 ; for (j = 0; j &lt; n; j++)
0100 {
0120 G0002:
0147 cmp r10, r22 ; r10 = 8*(r8 + j) &lt; 8*(r8 + n) = r22
0150 bge G0003
0160
0170 ; A[i,j] = 0.0;
0230 fstore fr3, A[r10]
0240
0245 r10 = r10 + #8 ; strength reduced multiply
0260 br G0002
0270 }
0280 G0003:
0290 ; A[i,i] = 1.0;
0320 r14 = r8 + r1 ; calculate subscript i * n + i
0330 r15 = r14 * #8 ; calculate byte address
0350 fstore fr4, A[r15]
0360
0370 ;i++
0380 r1 = r1 + #1
0390 br G0000
0400 }
0410 G0001:
There are now four multiplications within the outer loop that increments r1. Register r8 = r1*r2 at 0190 can be strength reduced by setting it before entering the loop (0055) and incrementing it by r2 at the bottom of the loop (0385).

The value r8*8 (at 0118) can be strength reduced by initializing it (0056) and adding 8*r2 to it when r8 gets incremented (0386).

Register r20 is being incremented by the invariant/constant r2 each time through the loop at 0117. After being incremented, it is multiplied by 8 to create r22 at 0119. That multiplication can be strength reduced by adding 8*r2 each time through the loop.

Furthermore, r1 is only being used to control the loop, so r1 can be replaced by a different induction variable such as r40. Where i went 0 &lt;= i &lt; n, register r40 goes 0 &lt;= r40 &lt; 8 * n * n.

== Other strength reduction operations ==
Operator strength reduction uses mathematical identities to replace slow math operations with faster operations. The benefits depend on the target CPU and sometimes on the surrounding code (which can affect the availability of other functional units within the CPU).

* replacing integer division or multiplication by a power of 2 with an arithmetic shift or logical shift
* replacing integer multiplication by a constant with a combination of shifts, adds or subtracts
* replacing integer division by a constant with a multiplication, taking advantage of the limited range of machine integers. This method also works if divisor is a non-integer sufficiently greater than 1, e.g. √2 or π.

== Induction variable (orphan) ==

Induction variable or recursive strength reduction replaces a function of some systematically changing variable with a simpler calculation using previous values of the function. In a procedural programming language this would apply to an expression involving a loop variable and in a declarative language it would apply to the argument of a recursive function. For example,

 f x = ... (3 ** x) ... (f (x + 1)) ...

becomes

 f x = f&#x27; x 1
 where
 f&#x27; x z = ... z ... (f&#x27; (x + 1) (3 * z)) ...

Here modified recursive function takes a second parameter z = 3 ** x, allowing the expensive computation (3 ** x) to be replaced by the cheaper (3 * z).

<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best singles of the United States. Published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single&#x27;s weekly physical sales and airplays. There were 15 singles that topped the chart this year. The first of these, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Angel&quot; by R. Kelly and Celine Dion, spent two weeks at the top, concluding a six-week run that had begun in December 1998.

During the year, 11 acts had achieved a first U.S. number-one single, including: Britney Spears, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Destiny&#x27;s Child, Dru Hill, Kool Moe Dee, Christina Aguilera, Enrique Iglesias, Jay-Z, Santana, and Rob Thomas. The longest running number-one single is &quot;Smooth&quot; by Santana featuring Matchbox Twenty frontman Rob Thomas, which attained 12 weeks at number-one. Ten of those weeks were logged in 1999 and two additional weeks were logged in 2000.

TLC was the only act with more than one number one song, with them hitting the top twice.

<text>USS &quot;Jamaica&quot; (CVE-43) (originally AVG-43 then later ACV-43), was an escort carrier of World War II that served in the British Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Shah&quot; (D21). Returned to the United States at war&#x27;s end, she was converted into a merchant vessel and she was sold into civilian service in 1946 as Salta. She was ultimately scrapped in 1966.

==Design and description==
HMS &quot;Shah&quot; was a in the Royal Navy. The ships in this class were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all preceding American-built escort carriers. Their hulls were designed as merchant ships but they were laid down as escort carriers and were not later conversions. All had a complement of 646 officers and ratings and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided a steam turbine, two boilers connected to one shaft giving , which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4 inch dual-purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannon in single mounts.
Her operational complement of aircraft carried changed over time, typically being some combination of up to about 18 Grumman Avengers, Grumman Wildcats, Grumman Hellcats, and Supermarine Walrus, plus deck cargo.

==Military service as &quot;Shah&quot;==
MC Hull 254 was laid down 13 November 1942 and launched as &quot;Jamaica&quot; under contract to the Maritime Commission by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding at Tacoma, Washington, on 21 April 1943 sponsored by Mrs. C. T. Simard. She was reclassified CVE-43 on 15 July 1943 and acquired by the United States Navy.

She was transferred to the United Kingdom under lend-lease, commissioning on 27 September 1943, as one of a large group of escort carriers suitable for anti-submarine work transferred to the Royal Navy in the Pacific.

&quot;Jamaica&quot; was renamed &quot;Shah&quot;, with a RN pennant number of D21. Commanded by William John Yendell, her initial air complement was 851 Naval Air Squadron with 12 Grumman Avenger II torpedo bombers and a flight of Grumman Wildcat fighters.

After sea trials, she was modified in Canada for convoy defence, this being completed at the end of the year. She sailed from Vancouver for San Francisco to take on her complement of operational aircraft, 12 Grumman Avengers and a flight of Grumman Wildcats. However, no flying was possible as her decks were also filled with Curtiss P-40s to be ferried to Cochin. From San Francisco she sailed to Williamstown, Melbourne, Australia. After resupplying she continued in this configuration to Cochin and Colombo.

Her duties were chiefly convoy defence and trade protection against German U-boats operating in the Indian Ocean with a shore base at Trincomalee. She took an active part in the war, heading the hunter-killer group which sank in the Indian Ocean on 12 August 1944. Alerted to the submarine&#x27;s presence in the area, 851&#x27;s Avengers located the U-boat and attempted to attack her, and directed the other ships in the group, , the and the sloop to a point where the U-boat was depth charged resulting in it sinking.

&quot;Shah&quot; was transferred to the East Indies Fleet and then refitted in Durban before taking part in the Burma campaign in 1945. Having suffered several aircraft losses on patrol and landing accidents, her complement was augmented around this time by a flight of Grumman Hellcats. During April and May 1945 she participated in Operation Bishop, launching patrols and strikes against Nicobar preparatory to the invasion of Rangoon.
Soon after, she was tasked with the search for the Japanese cruiser . Mechanical problems with the catapult resulted in most of 851&#x27;s Avengers being sent to in exchange for Hellcats from 800 and 804 Squadron. A serious landing accident by one of those Hellcats effectively removed &quot;Shah&quot; from operations on 11 May. Nonetheless 851&#x27;s Avengers, flying from &quot;Emperor&quot;, were able to locate and damage &quot;Haguro&quot;, prior to her sinking by the 26th Destroyer Flotilla in Operation Dukedom.

The Hellcats that survived the earlier landing accident were flown off &quot;Shah&quot; and she briefly returned to Ceylon and Bombay for refitting and training. Collecting surviving Avengers from 851 and 845 Squadrons, plus Hellcats and a Walrus for support and recovery during landing operations, in August she sailed to join Operation Zipper on the Malay coast, only to be stood down en route when Japan capitulated.

Disembarking her aircraft at Trincomalee on 26 August, she then sailed to the Clyde naval base via Aden and the Suez Canal where she was prepared for return to the United States. Arriving at Norfolk on 16 October, she was formally handed over to the United States on 26 November 1945.

==Merchant service as &quot;Salta&quot;==
She was sold into merchant service to Argentina on 20 June 1947 as &quot;Salta&quot;, named after the Argentinian city. The Newport News shipyard performed the conversion.

In 1963 she was the first ship on scene at the rescue of passengers and crew from the Greek liner when it caught fire in the Atlantic. At the time she was under the command of Captain José Barrere, on its way from Genoa, Italy, to Buenos Aires. &quot;Salta&quot; rescued 475 people and took aboard most of &quot;Lakonia&quot;″s lifeboats. &quot;Salta&quot; was scrapped in Buenos Aires in 1966.

<text>The IEEE 1164 standard (&quot;Multivalue Logic System for VHDL Model Interoperability&quot;) is a technical standard published by the IEEE in 1993. It describes the definitions of logic values to be used in electronic design automation, for the VHDL hardware description language. It was sponsored by the Design Automation Standards Committee of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The standardization effort was based on the donation of the Synopsys MVL-9 type declaration.

The primary data type (standard unresolved logic) consists of nine character literals (see table on the right). This system promoted a useful set of logic values that typical CMOS logic designs could implement in the vast majority of modeling situations, including:

* codice_1 literal to make tri-state buffer logic easy
* codice_2 and codice_3 weak drives to permit wired-AND and wired-OR logic.
* codice_4 for default value for all object declarations so that during simulations uninitialized values are easily detectable and thus easily corrected if necessary.

In VHDL, the hardware designer makes the declarations visible via the following codice_5 and codice_6 statements:
library IEEE;
use IEEE.std_logic_1164.all;
==Using values in simulation==

===Use of codice_4===
Many hardware description language (HDL) simulation tools, such as Verilog and VHDL, support an unknown value like that shown above during simulation of digital electronics. The unknown value may be the result of a design error, which the designer can correct before synthesis into an actual circuit. The unknown also represents uninitialised memory values and circuit inputs before the simulation has asserted what the real input value should be.

HDL synthesis tools usually produce circuits that operate only on binary logic.

===Use of codice_8===
When designing a digital circuit, some conditions may be outside the scope of the purpose that the circuit will perform. Thus, the designer does not care what happens under those conditions. In addition, the situation occurs that inputs to a circuit are masked by other signals so the value of that input has no effect on circuit behaviour.

In these situations, it is traditional to use codice_9 as a placeholder to indicate &quot;Don&#x27;t Care&quot; when building truth tables, but VHDL uses codice_10. &quot;Don&#x27;t care&quot;s are especially common in state machine design and Karnaugh map simplification. The codice_8 values provide additional degrees of freedom to the final circuit design, generally resulting in a simplified and smaller circuit.

Once the circuit design is complete and a real circuit is constructed, the codice_8 values will no longer exist. They will become some tangible codice_13 or codice_14 value but could be either depending on the final design optimization.

===Use of codice_1===
Some digital devices support a form of three-state logic on their outputs only. The three states are &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot;.

Commonly referred to as tristate logic (a trademark of National Semiconductor), it comprises the usual true and false states, with a third &quot;transparent&quot; high impedance state (or &#x27;off-state&#x27;) which effectively disconnects the logic output. This provides an effective way to connect several logic outputs to a single input, where all but one are put into the high impedance state, allowing the remaining output to operate in the normal binary sense. This is commonly used to connect banks of computer memory and other similar devices to a common data bus; a large number of devices can communicate over the same channel simply by ensuring only one is enabled at a time.

While outputs can have one of three states, inputs can only recognise two. Although it could be argued that the high-impedance state is effectively an &quot;unknown&quot;, there is no provision in most electronics to interpret a high-impedance state as a state in itself. Inputs can only detect &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;.

When a digital input is left disconnected, the digital value interpreted by the input depends on the type of technology used. TTL technology will reliably default to a &quot;1&quot; state. On the other hand, CMOS technology will temporarily hold the previous state seen on that input (due to the capacitance of the gate input). Over time, leakage current causes the CMOS input to drift in a random direction, possibly causing the input state to flip. Disconnected inputs on CMOS devices can pick up noise, they can cause oscillation, the supply current may dramatically increase (crowbar power) or the device may completely destroy itself.

<text>HMS &quot;Patroller&quot; was an escort carrier in the Royal Navy during the Second World War. Laid down in 1942 at the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding company, she was originally named USS &quot;Keweenaw&quot; (CVE-44). USS &quot;Keweenaw&quot; (previously AVG-44 then later ACV-44) was an escort carrier laid down under Maritime Commission contract by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding of Tacoma, Washington, 27 November 1942; launched 6 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. R. G. Risley; assigned to the United Kingdom 10 June 1943; reclassified CVE-44 on 15 July 1943; and transferred to the United Kingdom under lend-lease 22 October 1943.

During the remainder of war, she served the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Patroller&quot; and operated in the Atlantic on convoy escort and patrol duty, with brief stints as a transport carrier for both the Army and Navy. Arriving Norfolk, Virginia, 9 December 1946, she was returned to the United States Navy the same day. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry 7 February 1947 and she was sold to Waterman Steamship Corp., 26 August 1947 as &quot;Almkerk&quot; (later renamed &quot;Pacific Reliance&quot;). She was scrapped in Taiwan in 1974.

==Design and description==

These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by one shaft, two boilers and a steam turbine giving 9,350 shaft horsepower (SHP), which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

<text>Sebastian Franck (20 January 1499 Donauwörth, Swabia – c. 1543 Basel, Switzerland) was a 16th-century German freethinker, humanist, and radical reformer.

==Biography==
Franck was born in 1499 in Donauwörth, Swabia. Because of this he styled himself Franck von Wörd. He entered the University of Ingolstadt on 26 March 1515, and afterwards went to Bethlehem College, incorporated with the university, as an institution of the Dominicans at Heidelberg. Here he met Martin Bucer and Martin Frecht, with whom he might have attended Luther&#x27;s Heidelberg disputation in October 1518.

Originally ordained as a priest, in 1525 Franck went over to the Reformed party at Nuremberg and became preacher at Gustenfelden. His first work was a German translation (with additions) of the first part of the &quot;Diallage&quot; (or &quot;Conciliatio locorum Scripturae&quot;), directed against Sacramentarians and Anabaptists by Andrew Althamer, then deacon of St. Sebald at Nuremberg. On 17 March 1528 he married Ottilie Beham, supposedly the sister of the &quot;godless&quot; painters, Bartholomew and Sebald Beham, pupils of Albrecht Dürer and followers of Hans Denck. In the same year he wrote a treatise against drunkenness. In 1529 he produced a free version of the &quot;Supplycacyon of the Beggers&quot;, written by the English Protestant Simon Fish. Franck, in his preface, says the original was in English; elsewhere he says it was in Latin; the theory that his German was really the original is not warranted.

Advance in his religious ideas led him to seek the freer atmosphere of Strasbourg in the autumn of 1529. To his translation (1530) of a Latin &quot;Chronicle and Description of Turkey&quot; (&quot;Turkenchronik&quot;), by a Transylvanian captive, which had been prefaced by Luther, he added an appendix holding up the Turk as in many respects an example to Christians. He also substituted, in lieu of the restrictions of Lutheran, Zwinglian and Anabaptist sects, the vision of an invisible spiritual church, universal in its scope. To this ideal he remained faithful. At Strassburg began his friendship with Kaspar Schwenkfeld. Here he also published, in 1531, his most important work, the &quot;Chronica, Zeitbuch und Geschichtsbibel&quot;, largely a compilation on the basis of the Nuremberg Chronicle (1493), and in its treatment of social and religious questions connected with the Reformation. In it he exhibited a strong sympathy with &quot;heretics&quot; and fairness to all kinds of freedom in opinion. As a German historian, he is a forerunner of Gottfried Arnold. Driven from Strassburg by the authorities, after a short imprisonment in December 1531, he tried to make a living in 1532 as a soapboiler at Esslingen, removing in 1533 for a better market to Ulm, where on 28 October 1534 he was admitted as a burgess.

His &quot;Weltbuch&quot;, a supplement to his &quot;Chronica&quot;, was printed at Tübingen in 1534. His publication, in the same year, of the &quot;Paradoxa&quot; brought him into trouble with the authorities. An order for his banishment was withdrawn on his promise to submit future works for censure. Not interpreting this as applying to works printed outside Ulm, he published in 1538 at Augsburg his &quot;Guldin Arch&quot; and at Frankfort his &quot;Germaniae chronicon&quot;, with the result that he had to leave Ulm in January 1539. He seems to have had no settled abode from that time. At Basel he found work as a printer, and it was probably there that he died in the winter of 1542–1543. He had published in 1539 his &quot;Kriegbuchlein des Friedens&quot;, his &quot;Schrifftliche und ganz grundliche Auslegung des 64 Psalms&quot;, and his &quot;Das verbutschierte mit sieben Siegein verschlossene Buch&quot; (a biblical index, exhibiting the dissonance of Scripture). In 1541 he published his &quot;Spruchwörter&quot; (a collection of proverbs). In 1542 he issued a new edition of his &quot;Paradoxa&quot; and some smaller works.

Franck combined the humanist&#x27;s passion for freedom with the mystic&#x27;s devotion to the religion of the spirit. Luther contemptuously dismissed him as a mouthpiece of the devil. Martin Frecht of Nuremberg pursued him with bitter zeal. But his courage did not fail him, and in his last year, in a public Latin letter, he exhorted his friend Johann Campanus to maintain freedom of thought in face of the charge of heresy.

Franck came to believe that God communicates with individuals through a portion of the divine remaining in each human being. He came to dismiss the &quot;human institution&quot; of the church, and believed that theology could not properly claim to give expression to this inner word of God in the heart of the believer. For example, Franck wrote, &quot;To substitute Scripture for the self-revealing Spirit is to put the dead letter in the place of the living Word...&quot;

Franck’s comment “God is an unutterable sigh, lying in the depths of the heart,” quoted by Julius Wilhelm Zincgref was described by Ludwig Feuerbach as “the most remarkable, the profoundest, truest expression of Christian Mysticism”.

<text>USS &quot;Prince&quot; (CVE-45) (originally named &quot;McClure&quot;, designated AVG-45 then later ACV-45) was an escort carrier laid down on 17 December 1942 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation of Tacoma, Washington. She was renamed &quot;Prince&quot; on 13 November 1942 and launched on 18 May 1943. She was sponsored by Mrs. J. L. McGuigan, reclassified CVE-45 on 15 July 1943 and transferred to the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease on 17 October 1943.

&quot;Prince&quot; served the United Kingdom as HMS &quot;Rajah&quot; (D10). She was returned to the United States Navy at Norfolk, Virginia on 13 December 1946. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry on 7 February 1947 and delivered to her purchaser, Waterman Steamship Corporation, on 7 July. She became the merchant ship &quot;Drente&quot; (later renamed &quot;Lambros&quot;, then &quot;Ulysses&quot;) in 1948. She was scrapped in Taiwan in 1975.

==Design and description==
These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by two boilers connected to a steam turbine, which was connected to one shaft, giving 9,350 brake horsepower (SHP). This could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. The ship&#x27;s armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. Each ship had a maximum capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighters and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

<doc id="475942" wikidata="Q1539601" url="?curid=475942" title="Oliver (chimpanzee)">
<text>Oliver (c. 1957 – 2 June 2012) was a former &quot;performing&quot; chimpanzee once promoted as a missing link or &quot;humanzee&quot; due to his somewhat human-like appearance and a tendency to walk upright. Despite his somewhat unusual appearance and behavior, scientists found that Oliver was not a human-chimpanzee hybrid.

==Early life==
Supposedly, the chimpanzee was caught in the Congo.
Oliver was acquired as a young animal in 1970 by trainers Frank and Janet Berger. Some physical and behavioral evidence led the Bergers to believe Oliver was a creature other than a chimpanzee, perhaps a human-chimpanzee hybrid. Oliver possessed a flatter face than his fellow chimpanzees; was in the habit of walking bipedally, rather than on his knuckles much more often than his chimpanzee peers (until he was later struck with arthritis); and may have preferred human females over chimpanzee females. In a December 16, 2006 Discovery Channel special, Janet Berger stated that Oliver started to become attracted to her when he reached the age of 16. She and her husband Frank Berger decided to sell Oliver to New York attorney Michael Miller.

==Enchanted Village and other facilities (1977–1989)==

In 1977, Oliver&#x27;s owner, Michael Miller, gave Oliver to Ralph Helfer, partner in a small theme park called Enchanted Village in Buena Park, California, built on the site of the defunct Japanese Village and Deer Park attraction. When Enchanted Village closed later that year, Helfer continued exhibiting Oliver in a new venture, Gentle Jungle, which changed locations a few times before finally closing in 1982. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; did an extensive article about Oliver as a possible missing link or a new subspecies of chimpanzee. Oliver was transferred to the Wild Animal Training Center in Riverside, California, owned by Ken Decroo, but he was reportedly sold by Decroo in 1985. The last trainer to own Oliver was Bill Rivers. Rivers reported problems with Oliver kissing monkeys residing at the same location.

==Buckshire Corporation (1989–1998)==
Oliver was purchased in 1989 by the Buckshire Corporation, a Pennsylvania laboratory leasing out animals for scientific and cosmetic testing. His intake examination revealed some previous rough handling. He was never used in experiments, but for the next nine years, his home was a small cage, whose restricted size resulted in muscular atrophy to the point that Oliver&#x27;s limbs trembled. In 1996, Sharon Hursh, president of the Buckshire Corporation, after being petitioned by animal sanctuary Primarily Primates, allowed his retirement to Buckshire&#x27;s colony of 13 chimpanzees.

==Primarily Primates (1998–2012)==
In 1998, Oliver was transferred to Primarily Primates, which was founded by Wallace Swett in 1978. Older, partially sighted and arthritic, Oliver ended up at a spacious, open-air cage at Primarily Primates Inc. (PPI) in Bexar County, Texas. 

In 2005, just a few years into Oliver’s residency at the sanctuary, legal problems emerged after allegations of animal cruelty arose against the facility. Animal rights organization PETA was alerted by volunteers that animals residing at Primarily Primates were kept in barren and dirty cages, warranting the visit of a videographer to document the conditions. Additionally, the deaths of two research chimps sent from Ohio State University to stay at PPI raised more concern for the animals’ safety and a lawsuit was filed. Specific regards for the welfare of Oliver were later voiced by Houston SPCA vice president Jorge Ortega in an affidavit, where he claimed that during a visit to the Texas facility he was disturbed by Oliver’s enclosure, describing it as “filthy, too small,” without “meaningful enrichment materials,” and lacking a bucket or bowl for food. Texas Assistant Attorney General Ted Ross argued the long mismanagement of donation funds and understaffing is what led to such detriment.

In 2006, Oliver was placed in the temporary care of wildlife rehabilitator Lee Theisen-Watt, who had been court-appointed to oversee Primarily Primates while the state of Texas determined who would ultimately be in charge of the facility. 

On April 27, 2007, the state of Texas entered into a settlement agreement which removed Lee Theisen-Watt as overseer of Primarily Primates and replaced her with a board of directors that was headed by Eric Turton and Priscilla Feral. The settlement also dismissed all charges against Primarily Primates. Wally Swett was required to leave the property and was prohibited from serving either on the board or as an employee in the future.

Oliver remained in the care of Primarily Primates while the facility went through major renovations. Members of the re-formed board of directors expressed concern for Oliver in court proceedings and in news articles about the ongoing dispute over management of the sanctuary. Ethan Calamusa of the &quot;Star-Telegram&quot; reported that Friends of Animals was merging with Primarily Primates in order to restructure its management and address past concerns about the future of the sanctuary. Oliver lived out the remainder of his life in the care of the restructured Primarily Primates sanctuary.

==Death==
Oliver spent his last years with another chimpanzee, a female known as Raisin. She was placed with Oliver for companionship since Oliver&#x27;s advanced age and years in the research lab left him arthritic, mostly blind, and unable to interact daily with younger, more playful chimpanzees at the sanctuary.

News of Oliver as well as photos were often posted online by his caregivers, owing to public interest. He took part in regular enrichment activities including a watermelon smashing party documented in the Friends of Animals online newsletter, and even the chance to paint. Although elderly, Oliver had access to the outdoors and lived the rest of his life in quiet retirement.

Oliver died in his sleep and was found on June 2, 2012, with Raisin next to him; he was at least 55 years old. Stephen René Tello, executive director of Primarily Primates, said that Oliver would be cremated and his ashes would be spread on the grounds of the sanctuary of the primates.

==Genetic testing==
In 1996, while Oliver was still housed by the Buckshire Corporation, a geneticist from the University of Chicago tested portions of his DNA, and revealed that he had the 48 chromosomes of a normal chimpanzee, disproving past rumors that he had 47 (chimpanzees normally have 48 and humans normally have 46). In a separate study, Oliver&#x27;s cranial morphology, ear shape, freckles, and baldness were found to fall within the range of variability exhibited by the common chimpanzee. Further genetic testing, published in the &quot;American Journal of Physical Anthropology&quot;, found that Oliver&#x27;s mitochondrial DNA closely matched that of the central chimpanzee subspecies, which lives in the Republic of the Congo, Gabon, and other areas of Central Africa.

<text>A chipotle (, , , ; ), or chilpotle, is a smoke-dried ripe jalapeño chili pepper used for seasoning. It is a chili used primarily in Mexican and Mexican-inspired cuisines, such as Tex-Mex and Southwestern United States dishes. It comes in different forms, such as &quot;chipotles en adobo&quot; (stewed in adobo sauce).

==Production==
Jalapeño pepper (&quot;Capsicum annuum&quot;) is one of the most typical ingredients of Mexican cuisine. This chili pepper is consumed at the rate of 7–9 kg per year, per capita. It is mostly consumed fresh but also in different forms, such as pickled, dried, and smoked. Jalapeño varieties differ in size and heat. Typically, a grower passes through a jalapeño field, picking the unripe, green jalapeños for the market. Jalapeños are green for most of the season, but in the fall, which is the end of the growing season, they naturally ripen and turn bright red. In Mexico and the United States, there is a growing market for ripe red jalapeños (the last stage of maturation). They are kept on the bush as long as possible. When they are deep red and have lost much of their moisture, they are picked to be made into chipotles.

Smoking is a common technique of food preservation that provides a distinctive aroma and flavor and is traditionally carried out in a field open-oven. The smoking process can affect structural, chemical and nutritional properties of food. Furthermore, the type of wood used in the smoking process impacts the resulting smoked food. The smoking of jalapeños dates back centuries and was mainly used by the Aztecs, who are thought to have preserved the chilis by smoking them, a process they also used on meats. Chipotle production involves using firewood to dry and smoke the red jalapeño for six days in an open-smoker installation. The temperature is maintained between 65 and 75 °C, using mainly pecan wood.

Traditionally, the peppers are moved to a closed smoking chamber and spread on metal grills, but in recent years producers have begun using large gas dryers. Wood is put in a firebox, and the smoke enters the sealed chamber. Every few hours, the jalapeños are stirred to mix in the smoke. They are smoked for several days until most of the moisture is removed. The moisture within the red jalapeño peppers slightly decreases from 88% to 81% during the first three days, but by the end of the drying process, the moisture level reaches a final value of 6%. In the end, the chipotles are dried and shriveled like prunes or raisins. The underlying heat of the jalapeños combines with the taste of smoke, forming a flavor distinctive to chipotle peppers. Typically, ten pounds of jalapeños make one pound of chipotles after thoroughly drying. In recent years, some commercial producers have begun using large gas dryers and artificial smoke flavoring, which expedites the drying process but produces a less flavorful chipotle.

Other chilis can be smoked and dried for chipotle pepper, such as the bell or serrano variety, but smoked red jalapeños are most commonly used.

== History and etymology ==
The technique of smoke-drying jalapeños can be traced back to the early food preservation practices used in Mesoamerica, even before the Aztecs.
The name comes from the Nahuatl word (), meaning &#x27;smoked chili&#x27;. 
This form of chili was most likely encountered by Christopher Columbus on his trip to the New World and brought back to Spain, where it later spread to Europe, India, and beyond. Since the chilis are smoked, this would have enabled them to survive the long journey across several oceans.

==Varieties==

Chipotles are predominantly sourced from Mexico, where they produce two different varieties of the spice: &quot;morita&quot;, which is most commonly found in the United States, and the larger &quot;meco&quot;, which is mainly used domestically. &quot;Morita&quot; means &quot;small mulberry&quot; in Spanish and is grown primarily in the state of Chihuahua; it is typically darker in color with a reddish-purple exterior. They are smoked for less time and, in many cultures, considered inferior to the meco. The meco, also known as chili ahumado or típico, is grayish tan with a dusty-looking surface; some say it resembles a cigar butt. This pepper variation tends to be smokier in taste and is the preferred chipotle of many natives. They are sometimes referred to as chili navideño because they are reconstituted and stuffed to make a traditional dish that is most popular at Christmas time among Mexican locals. 

Most chipotle meco never make it across the Mexican border, although they can occasionally be found for sale in Mexican specialty markets.

Chipotle grande is a smoke-dried Huachinango chili with a similar flavor profile; however, the chili is larger and higher in cost. Sold fresh at the market, this variation of the chipotle pepper will typically sell for three to four times as much as jalapeño. 

Many pair this spice with annatto, cumin, ginger, oregano and tomato powder. Additionally, it is commonly paired with traditional dishes such as bean soup, pimento cheese, tomatillo salsa, fish tacos, and grilled flank steak. 

===Forms of chipotle===

Chipotles are purchased in numerous forms: chipotle powder, chipotle flakes, chipotle pods, canned chipotles in adobo sauce, concentrated chipotle base, and wet chipotle meat marinade.

Canned adobo sauce is the most common form in the United States, though its marinade or food preservative form originated in Spain. The marinade typically contains various spices, herbs, and vegetables, including tomatoes, onions, powdered dried chilis, garlic, and vinegar. &quot;Chipocludo,&quot; a term for preserving chipotles practiced in Central Mexico, refers to conservation in a jar of brown sugar and vinegar marinade. &quot;En adobo&quot; or &quot;chipotles adobado&quot; are denominations for seasoned canned chipotles in sauce.

==Use==
Chipotles impart a relatively mild but earthy spiciness to many dishes in Mexican cuisine. The chilis are used to make various salsas. Chipotle can be ground and combined with other spices to make a meat marinade – &quot;adobo&quot;. Chipotle is used, typically in powdered form, as an ingredient in homemade and commercial products, including some brands of barbecue sauce and hot sauce, as well as in some chili con carnes and stews. Usually, when used commercially, the product is advertised as having chipotle in it.

Chipotles are spicy and have a distinctive smoky flavor. The flesh is thick, so the chilis are usually used in a slow-cooked dish rather than raw. They can also be lightly toasted on a dry comal or skillet until they are fragrant and slightly swell. When overcooked, they can be very bitter. For some traditional Mexican sauces, the toasted chilis would be sautéed in oil or lard before being pureed. The chilis can also be soaked in warm water or stock until they become pliable and then can be added to a dish. The different forms of chipotle can be added to soups, stews, and in the braising liquid for meat. They can also accompany beans, pickled vegetable mixes, scrambled eggs, or &quot;chilaquiles&quot;. They can also be stuffed, baked, and added to cake or brownies.

<doc id="475948" wikidata="Q4883869" url="?curid=475948" title="Belleville Rendez-vous (song)">
<text>&quot;Belleville Rendez-vous&quot; is a song from the 2003 animated film &quot;Les Triplettes de Belleville&quot;, with music by Benoît Charest and lyrics by Sylvain Chomet. It was performed &quot;in character&quot; in the film by Béatrice Bonifassi.

==Description==
The soundtrack album includes two versions of the song, one in French and the other in English, both performed by – M – (a.k.a. Matthieu Chedid). It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song and has subsequently been covered by the male duo the Lost Fingers and the female trio Rock Paper Scissors. Another version of the song, subtitled &quot;maquette&quot;, or &quot;demo&quot;, was also included in the soundtrack and sung by Béatrice Bonifassi, who also provided the singing voice of the triplets.

==Music video==
The music video, which comes in French and English versions, shows – M – visiting a psychiatrist. As he tells his troubles in song, ghosts, having heads resembling his, start appearing and dancing on screen. The mental troubles of – M – begin to take their toll as he stands and dances wildly to the dance of the ghosts, much to the fear of the psychiatrist, who slowly walks to keep distance. The music video ends with – M – being grabbed by medical personnel, with one of them tranquilizing him before they take him away.

<text>A race condition or race hazard is the condition of an electronics, software, or other system where the system&#x27;s substantive behavior is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events, leading to unexpected or inconsistent results. It becomes a bug when one or more of the possible behaviors is undesirable.

The term &quot;race condition&quot; was already in use by 1954, for example in David A. Huffman&#x27;s doctoral thesis &quot;The synthesis of sequential switching circuits&quot;.

Race conditions can occur especially in logic circuits or multithreaded or distributed software programs. Using mutual exclusion can prevent race conditions in distributed software systems.

==In electronics==
A typical example of a race condition may occur when a logic gate combines signals that have traveled along different paths from the same source. The inputs to the gate can change at slightly different times in response to a change in the source signal. The output may, for a brief period, change to an unwanted state before settling back to the designed state. Certain systems can tolerate such glitches but if this output functions as a clock signal for further systems that contain memory, for example, the system can rapidly depart from its designed behaviour (in effect, the temporary glitch becomes a permanent glitch).

Consider, for example, a two-input AND gate fed with the following logic: formula_1A logic signal formula_2 on one input and its negation, formula_3 (the ¬ is a Boolean negation), on another input in theory never output a true value: formula_4. If, however, changes in the value of formula_2 take longer to propagate to the second input than the first when formula_2 changes from false to true then a brief period will ensue during which both inputs are true, and so the gate&#x27;s output will also be true.

A practical example of a race condition can occur when logic circuitry is used to detect certain outputs of a counter. If all the bits of the counter do not change exactly simultaneously, there will be intermediate patterns that can trigger false matches.

===Critical and non-critical forms===
A &quot;critical race condition&quot; occurs when the order in which internal variables are changed determines the eventual state that the state machine will end up in.

A &quot;non-critical race condition&quot; occurs when the order in which internal variables are changed does not determine the eventual state that the state machine will end up in.

===Static, dynamic, and essential forms===
A &quot;static race condition&quot; occurs when a signal and its complement are combined.

A &quot;dynamic race condition&quot; occurs when it results in multiple transitions when only one is intended. They are due to interaction between gates. It can be eliminated by using no more than two levels of gating.

An &quot;essential race condition&quot; occurs when an input has two transitions in less than the total feedback propagation time. Sometimes they are cured using inductive delay line elements to effectively increase the time duration of an input signal.

== Workarounds ==
Design techniques such as Karnaugh maps encourage designers to recognize and eliminate race conditions before they cause problems. Often logic redundancy can be added to eliminate some kinds of races.

As well as these problems, some logic elements can enter metastable states, which create further problems for circuit designers.

==In software==
A race condition can arise in software when a computer program has multiple code paths that are executing at the same time. If the multiple code paths take a different amount of time than expected, they can finish in a different order than expected, which can cause software bugs due to unanticipated behavior. A race can also occur between two programs, resulting in security issues.

Critical race conditions cause invalid execution and software bugs. Critical race conditions often happen when the processes or threads depend on some shared state. Operations upon shared states are done in critical sections that must be mutually exclusive. Failure to obey this rule can corrupt the shared state.

A data race is a type of race condition. Data races are important parts of various formal memory models. The memory model defined in the C11 and C++11 standards specify that a C or C++ program containing a data race has undefined behavior.

A race condition can be difficult to reproduce and debug because the end result is nondeterministic and depends on the relative timing between interfering threads. Problems of this nature can therefore disappear when running in debug mode, adding extra logging, or attaching a debugger. A bug that disappears like this during debugging attempts is often referred to as a &quot;Heisenbug&quot;. It is therefore better to avoid race conditions by careful software design.

===Example===
Assume that two threads each increment the value of a global integer variable by 1. Ideally, the following sequence of operations would take place:

In the case shown above, the final value is 2, as expected. However, if the two threads run simultaneously without locking or synchronization (via semaphores), the outcome of the operation could be wrong. The alternative sequence of operations below demonstrates this scenario:

In this case, the final value is 1 instead of the expected result of 2. This occurs because here the increment operations are not mutually exclusive. Mutually exclusive operations are those that cannot be interrupted while accessing some resource such as a memory location.

=== Data race ===

Not everyone regards data races as a subset of race conditions. The precise definition of data race is specific to the formal concurrency model being used, but typically it refers to a situation where a memory operation in one thread could potentially attempt to access a memory location at the same time that a memory operation in another thread is writing to that memory location, in a context where this is dangerous. This implies that a data race is different from a race condition as it is possible to have nondeterminism due to timing even in a program without data races, for example, in a program in which all memory accesses use only atomic operations.

This can be dangerous because on many platforms, if two threads write to a memory location at the same time, it may be possible for the memory location to end up holding a value that is some arbitrary and meaningless combination of the bits representing the values that each thread was attempting to write; this could result in memory corruption if the resulting value is one that neither thread attempted to write (sometimes this is called a &#x27;torn write&#x27;). Similarly, if one thread reads from a location while another thread is writing to it, it may be possible for the read to return a value that is some arbitrary and meaningless combination of the bits representing the value that the memory location held before the write, and of the bits representing the value being written.

On many platforms, special memory operations are provided for simultaneous access; in such cases, typically simultaneous access using these special operations is safe, but simultaneous access using other memory operations is dangerous. Sometimes such special operations (which are safe for simultaneous access) are called &quot;atomic&quot; or &quot;synchronization&quot; operations, whereas the ordinary operations (which are unsafe for simultaneous access) are called &quot;data&quot; operations. This is probably why the term is &quot;data&quot; race; on many platforms, where there is a race condition involving only &quot;synchronization&quot; operations, such a race may be nondeterministic but otherwise safe; but a &quot;data&quot; race could lead to memory corruption or undefined behavior.

=== Example definitions of data races in particular concurrency models ===
The precise definition of data race differs across formal concurrency models. This matters because concurrent behavior is often non-intuitive and so formal reasoning is sometimes applied.

The &quot;C++ standard&quot;, in draft N4296 (2014-11-19), defines data race as follows in section 1.10.23 (page 14)
Two actions are &quot;potentially concurrent&quot; if
* they are performed by different threads, or
* they are unsequenced, and at least one is performed by a signal handler.

The execution of a program contains a &quot;data race&quot; if it contains two potentially concurrent conflicting actions, at least one of which is not atomic, and neither happens before the other, except for the special case for signal handlers described below [omitted]. Any such data race results in undefined behavior.
The parts of this definition relating to signal handlers are idiosyncratic to C++ and are not typical of definitions of &quot;data race&quot;.

The paper &quot;Detecting Data Races on Weak Memory Systems&quot; provides a different definition:

&quot;two memory operations &quot;conflict&quot; if they access the same location and at least one of them is a write operation ...
&quot;Two memory operations, x and y, in a sequentially consistent execution form a race 〈x,y〉, iff x and y conflict, and they are not ordered by the hb1 relation of the execution. The race 〈x,y〉, is a &quot;data race&quot; iff at least one of x or y is a data operation.

Here we have two memory operations accessing the same location, one of which is a write.

The hb1 relation is defined elsewhere in the paper, and is an example of a typical &quot;happens-before&quot; relation; intuitively, if we can prove that we are in a situation where one memory operation X is guaranteed to be executed to completion before another memory operation Y begins, then we say that &quot;X happens-before Y&quot;. If neither &quot;X happens-before Y&quot; nor &quot;Y happens-before X&quot;, then we say that X and Y are &quot;not ordered by the hb1 relation&quot;. So, the clause &quot;... and they are not ordered by the hb1 relation of the execution&quot; can be intuitively translated as &quot;... and X and Y are potentially concurrent&quot;.

The paper considers dangerous only those situations in which at least one of the memory operations is a &quot;data operation&quot;; in other parts of this paper, the paper also defines a class of &quot;synchronization operations&quot; which are safe for potentially simultaneous use, in contrast to &quot;data operations&quot;.

The &quot;Java Language Specification&quot; provides a different definition:

Two accesses to (reads of or writes to) the same variable are said to be conflicting if at least one of the accesses is a write ... When a program contains two conflicting accesses (§17.4.1) that are not ordered by a happens-before relationship, it is said to contain a data race ... a data race cannot cause incorrect behavior such as returning the wrong length for an array.

A critical difference between the C++ approach and the Java approach is that in C++, a data race is undefined behavior, whereas in Java, a data race merely affects &quot;inter-thread actions&quot;. This means that in C++, an attempt to execute a program containing a data race could (while still adhering to the spec) crash or could exhibit insecure or bizarre behavior, whereas in Java, an attempt to execute a program containing a data race may produce undesired concurrency behavior but is otherwise (assuming that the implementation adheres to the spec) safe.

==== Sequential Consistency for Data Race Freedom ====
An important facet of data races is that in some contexts, a program that is free of data races is guaranteed to execute in a sequentially consistent manner, greatly easing reasoning about the concurrent behavior of the program. Formal memory models that provide such a guarantee are said to exhibit an &quot;SC for DRF&quot; (Sequential Consistency for Data Race Freedom) property. This approach has been said to have achieved recent consensus (presumably compared to approaches which guarantee sequential consistency in all cases, or approaches which do not guarantee it at all).

For example, in Java, this guarantee is directly specified:

A program is correctly synchronized if and only if all sequentially consistent executions are free of data races.

If a program is correctly synchronized, then all executions of the program will appear to be sequentially consistent (§17.4.3).

&quot;This is an extremely strong guarantee for programmers. Programmers do not need to reason about reorderings to determine that their code contains data races. Therefore they do not need to reason about reorderings when determining whether their code is correctly synchronized. Once the determination that the code is correctly synchronized is made, the programmer does not need to worry that reorderings will affect his or her code.&quot;

&quot;A program must be correctly synchronized to avoid the kinds of counterintuitive behaviors that can be observed when code is reordered. The use of correct synchronization does not ensure that the overall behavior of a program is correct. However, its use does allow a programmer to reason about the possible behaviors of a program in a simple way; the behavior of a correctly synchronized program is much less dependent on possible reorderings. Without correct synchronization, very strange, confusing and counterintuitive behaviors are possible.&quot;
By contrast, a draft C++ specification does not directly require an SC for DRF property, but merely observes that there exists a theorem providing it:
[Note:It can be shown that programs that correctly use mutexes and memory_order_seq_cst operations to prevent all data races and use no other synchronization operations behave as if the operations executed by their constituent threads were simply interleaved, with each value computation of an object being taken from the last side effect on that object in that interleaving. This is normally referred to as “sequential consistency”. However, this applies only to data-race-free programs, and data-race-free programs cannot observe most program transformations that do not change single-threaded program semantics. In fact, most single-threaded program transformations continue to be allowed, since any program that behaves differently as a result must perform an undefined operation.— end note
Note that the C++ draft specification admits the possibility of programs that are valid but use synchronization operations with a memory_order other than memory_order_seq_cst, in which case the result may be a program which is correct but for which no guarantee of sequentially consistency is provided. In other words, in C++, some correct programs are not sequentially consistent. This approach is thought to give C++ programmers the freedom to choose faster program execution at the cost of giving up ease of reasoning about their program.

There are various theorems, often provided in the form of memory models, that provide SC for DRF guarantees given various contexts. The premises of these theorems typically place constraints upon both the memory model (and therefore upon the implementation), and also upon the programmer; that is to say, typically it is the case that there are programs which do not meet the premises of the theorem and which could not be guaranteed to execute in a sequentially consistent manner.

The DRF1 memory model provides SC for DRF and allows the optimizations of the WO (weak ordering), RCsc (Release Consistency with sequentially consistent special operations), VAX memory model, and data-race-free-0 memory models. The PLpc memory model provides SC for DRF and allows the optimizations of the TSO (Total Store Order), PSO, PC (Processor Consistency), and RCpc (Release Consistency with processor consistency special operations) models. DRFrlx provides a sketch of an SC for DRF theorem in the presence of relaxed atomics.

===Computer security===
Many software race conditions have associated computer security implications. A race condition allows an attacker with access to a shared resource to cause other actors that utilize that resource to malfunction, resulting in effects including denial of service and privilege escalation.

A specific kind of race condition involves checking for a predicate (e.g. for authentication), then acting on the predicate, while the state can change between the &quot;time of check&quot; and the &quot;time of use&quot;. When this kind of bug exists in security-sensitive code, a security vulnerability called a time-of-check-to-time-of-use (&quot;TOCTTOU&quot;) bug is created.

Race conditions are also intentionally used to create hardware random number generators and physically unclonable functions. PUFs can be created by designing circuit topologies with identical paths to a node and relying on manufacturing variations to randomly determine which paths will complete first. By measuring each manufactured circuit&#x27;s specific set of race condition outcomes, a profile can be collected for each circuit and kept secret in order to later verify a circuit&#x27;s identity.

===File systems===
Two or more programs may collide in their attempts to modify or access a file system, which can result in data corruption or privilege escalation. File locking provides a commonly used solution. A more cumbersome remedy involves organizing the system in such a way that one unique process (running a daemon or the like) has exclusive access to the file, and all other processes that need to access the data in that file do so only via interprocess communication with that one process. This requires synchronization at the process level.

A different form of race condition exists in file systems where unrelated programs may affect each other by suddenly using up available resources such as disk space, memory space, or processor cycles. Software not carefully designed to anticipate and handle this race situation may then become unpredictable. Such a risk may be overlooked for a long time in a system that seems very reliable. But eventually enough data may accumulate or enough other software may be added to critically destabilize many parts of a system. An example of this occurred with the near loss of the Mars Rover &quot;Spirit&quot; not long after landing, which occurred due to deleted file entries causing the file system library to consume all available memory space. A solution is for software to request and reserve all the resources it will need before beginning a task; if this request fails then the task is postponed, avoiding the many points where failure could have occurred. Alternatively, each of those points can be equipped with error handling, or the success of the entire task can be verified afterwards, before continuing. A more common approach is to simply verify that enough system resources are available before starting a task; however, this may not be adequate because in complex systems the actions of other running programs can be unpredictable.

===Networking===
In networking, consider a distributed chat network like IRC, where a user who starts a channel automatically acquires channel-operator privileges. If two users on different servers, on different ends of the same network, try to start the same-named channel at the same time, each user&#x27;s respective server will grant channel-operator privileges to each user, since neither server will yet have received the other server&#x27;s signal that it has allocated that channel. (This problem has been largely solved by various IRC server implementations.)

In this case of a race condition, the concept of the &quot;shared resource&quot; covers the state of the network (what channels exist, as well as what users started them and therefore have what privileges), which each server can freely change as long as it signals the other servers on the network about the changes so that they can update their conception of the state of the network. However, the latency across the network makes possible the kind of race condition described. In this case, heading off race conditions by imposing a form of control over access to the shared resource—say, appointing one server to control who holds what privileges—would mean turning the distributed network into a centralized one (at least for that one part of the network operation).

Race conditions can also exist when a computer program is written with non-blocking sockets, in which case the performance of the program can be dependent on the speed of the network link.

===Life-critical systems===
Software flaws in life-critical systems can be disastrous. Race conditions were among the flaws in the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine, which led to the death of at least three patients and injuries to several more.

Another example is the energy management system provided by GE Energy and used by Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp (among other power facilities). A race condition existed in the alarm subsystem; when three sagging power lines were tripped simultaneously, the condition prevented alerts from being raised to the monitoring technicians, delaying their awareness of the problem. This software flaw eventually led to the North American Blackout of 2003. GE Energy later developed a software patch to correct the previously undiscovered error.

===Tools===
Many software tools exist to help detect race conditions in software. They can be largely categorized into two groups: static analysis tools and dynamic analysis tools.

Thread Safety Analysis is a static analysis tool for annotation-based intra-procedural static analysis, originally implemented as a branch of gcc, and now reimplemented in Clang, supporting PThreads.

Dynamic analysis tools include: 
* Intel Inspector, a memory and thread checking and debugging tool to increase the reliability, security, and accuracy of C/C++ and Fortran applications; Intel Advisor, a sampling based, SIMD vectorization optimization and shared memory threading assistance tool for C, C++, C#, and Fortran software developers and architects; 
* ThreadSanitizer, which uses binary (Valgrind-based) or source, LLVM-based instrumentation, and supports PThreads; and Helgrind, a Valgrind tool for detecting synchronisation errors in C, C++ and Fortran programs that use the POSIX pthreads threading primitives.
* Data Race Detector is designed to find data races in the Go Programming language.

There are several benchmarks designed to evaluate the effectiveness of data race detection tools
* DataRaceBench is a benchmark suite designed to systematically and quantitatively evaluate data race detection tools which analyze multi-threaded applications written in OpenMP.

==In other areas==

Neuroscience is demonstrating that race conditions can occur in mammal brains as well.

In UK railway signalling, a race condition would arise in the carrying out of Rule 55. According to this rule, if a train was stopped on a running line by a signal, the locomotive fireman would walk to the signal box in order to remind the signalman that the train was present. In at least one case, at Winwick in 1934, an accident occurred because the signalman accepted another train before the fireman arrived. Modern signalling practice removes the race condition by making it possible for the driver to instantaneously contact the signal box by radio.

<doc id="475953" wikidata="Q950354" url="?curid=475953" title="Jitterbug">
<text>Jitterbug is a generalized term used to describe swing dancing. It is often synonymous with the lindy hop dance but might include elements of the jive, east coast swing, collegiate shag, charleston, balboa and other swing dances.

Swing dancing originated in the African-American communities of New York City in the early 20th century. Many nightclubs had a whites-only or blacks-only policy due to racial segregation, however the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem had a no-discrimination policy which allowed whites and blacks to dance together and it was there that the Lindy Hop dance flourished, started by dancers such as George Snowden and Frank Manning. The term jitterbug was originally a ridicule used by black patrons to describe whites who started to dance the Lindy Hop, as they were dancing faster and jumpier than was intended, like &quot;jittering bugs&quot;, although it quickly lost its negative connotation as the more erratic version caught on. Both the Lindy Hop and the &quot;jitterbug&quot; became popular outside Harlem when the dance was featured in Hollywood films and Broadway theatre, starring the performance group Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers.

== Etymology ==

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;) the word &quot;jitterbug&quot; is a combination of the words &quot;jitter&quot; and &quot;bug&quot;; both words are of unknown origin.

The first use of the word &quot;jitters&quot; quoted by the &quot;OED&quot; is from 1929, Act II of the play &quot;Strictly Dishonorable&quot; by Preston Sturges where the character Isabelle says: &quot;Willie&#x27;s got the jitters&quot; is answered by a judge &quot;Jitters?&quot; to which Isabelle answers &quot;You know, he makes faces all the time.&quot; The second quote in the &quot;OED&quot; is from the N.Y. Press from 2 April 1930: &quot;The game is played only after the mugs and wenches have taken on too much gin and they arrive at the state of jitters, a disease known among the common herd as heebie jeebies.&quot; 

The first quote containing the term “jitter bug” recorded by the &quot;OED&quot; is from the 1934 Cab Calloway song “Jitter Bug”. The magazine &quot;Song Hits&quot;, in the 19 November 1939 issue, published the lyrics, including: “They’re four little jitter bugs. He has the jitters ev’ry morn; that’s why jitter sauce was born.”

According to H. W. Fry in his review of &quot;Dictionary of Word Origins&quot; by Joseph Twadell Shipley in 1945 the word &quot;jitters&quot; &quot;is from a spoonerism [&#x27;bin and jitters&#x27; for &#x27;gin and bitters&#x27;]...and originally referred to one under the influence of gin and bitters&quot;.

Wentworth and Flexner explains &quot;jitterbug&quot; as &quot;[o]ne who, though not a musician, enthusiastically likes or understands swing music; a swing fan&quot; or &quot;[o]ne who dances frequently to swing music&quot; or &quot;[a] devotee of jitterbug music and dancing; one who follows the fashions and fads of the jitterbug devotee... To dance, esp[ecially] to jazz or swing music and usu[ally] in an extremely vigorous and athletic manner&quot;.

==Early history==
Jitterbugging developed from dances performed by African-Americans at juke joints and dance halls. The Carolina shag and single Lindy Hop dances formed the basis of the jitterbug, which gave way to the double Lindy Hop when rock and roll became popular.

White dancers picked up the energetic jitterbug from dancers at black venues. Venues in the Hill District of Pittsburgh were popular places for whites to learn the jitterbug. The Savoy Ballroom, a dance hall in Harlem, was a famous cross-cultural venue, frequented by both black locals and white tourists. Norma Miller, a former Lindy Hop dancer who regularly performed at the Savoy, noted that the dances performed there were choreographed in advance, which was not always understood by the tourists, who sometimes believed the performers were just dancing socially. 

A musical number called &quot;The Jitterbug&quot; was written for the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The &quot;jitterbug&quot; was a bug sent by the Wicked Witch of the West to waylay the heroes by forcing them to do a jitterbug-style dance. Although the sequence was not included in the final version of the film, the witch is later heard to tell the flying monkey leader, &quot;I&#x27;ve sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.&quot; The song as sung by Judy Garland as Dorothy and some of the establishing dialogue survived from the soundtrack as the B-side of the disc release of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;.

==Popularity==
In 1944, with the United States&#x27; continuing involvement in World War II, a 30% federal excise tax was levied against night clubs that featured dancing. Although the tax was later reduced to 20%, &quot;No Dancing Allowed&quot; signs went up all over the country. It has been argued that this tax had a significant role in the decline of public dancing as a recreational activity in the United States.

World War II facilitated the spread of jitterbug across the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. Across the Atlantic in preparation for D-Day, there were nearly 1,6 million American troops stationed throughout Britain in May 1944. Numbers dwindled thereafter, but as late as April 30, 1945 there were still over 224,000 airmen, 109,000 communications zone troops, and 100,000 in hospitals or preparing to serve as individual replacements.

Dancing was not a popular pastime in Britain before the war, and many ballrooms had been closed for lack of business. In the wake of the arrival of American troops, many of these re-opened, installing jukeboxes rather than hiring live bands. Working class women who had never danced recreationally before made up a large part of the attendees, along with American soldiers and sailors. British Samoans were doing a &quot;Seabee version&quot; of the jitterbug by January 1944. By November 1945 after the departure of the American troops following D-Day, English couples were being warned not to continue doing energetic &quot;rude American dancing,&quot; as it was disapproved of by the upper classes. &quot;Time&quot; reported that American troops stationed in France in 1945 jitterbugged, and by 1946, jitterbug had become a craze in England. It was already a competition dance in Australia.

A United Press item datelined Hollywood on 9 June 1945 stated that dancer Florida Edwards was awarded a $7,870 judgement by the district court of appeals for injuries she sustained while jitterbugging at the Hollywood Canteen the previous year.

In 1957, the Philadelphia-based television show &quot;American Bandstand&quot; was picked up by the American Broadcasting Company and shown across the United States. &quot;American Bandstand&quot; featured popular songs of the day, live appearances by musicians, and dancing in the studio. At this time, the most popular fast dance was jitterbug, which was described as &quot;a frenetic leftover of the swing era ballroom days that was only slightly less acrobatic than Lindy&quot;.

In a 1962 article in the &quot;Memphis Commercial Appeal&quot;, bassist Bill Black, who had backed Elvis Presley from 1954 to 1957, listed &quot;jitterbug&quot; along with the twist and cha-cha as &quot;the only dance numbers you can play&quot;.

<text>In fluid dynamics, a fluid parcel, also known as a fluid element or material element, is an infinitesimal volume of fluid, identifiable throughout its dynamic history while moving with the fluid flow. As it moves, the mass of a fluid parcel remains constant, while—in a compressible flow—its volume may change, and its shape changes due to distortion by the flow. In an incompressible flow, the volume of the fluid parcel is also a constant (isochoric flow).

Material surfaces and material lines are the corresponding notions for surfaces and lines, respectively.

The mathematical concept of a fluid parcel is closely related to the description of fluid motion—its kinematics and dynamics—in a Lagrangian frame of reference. In this reference frame, fluid parcels are labelled and followed through space and time. But also in the Eulerian frame of reference the notion of fluid parcels can be advantageous, for instance in defining the material derivative, streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines; or for determining the Stokes drift.

The fluid parcels, as used in continuum mechanics, are to be distinguished from microscopic particles (molecules and atoms) in physics. Fluid parcels describe the average velocity and other properties of fluid particles, averaged over a length scale which is large compared to the mean free path, but small compared to the typical length scales of the specific flow under consideration. This requires the Knudsen number to be small, as is also a pre-requisite for the continuum hypothesis to be a valid one. Further note, that unlike the mathematical concept of a fluid parcel which can be uniquely identified—as well as exclusively distinguished from its direct neighbouring parcels—in a real fluid such a parcel would not always consist of the same particles. Molecular diffusion will slowly evolve the parcel properties.

<text>is a Japanese animated media franchise about a five-member superhero ninja team created by Tatsuo Yoshida and produced by Tatsunoko Productions. The original anime series, which debuted in 1972, was eponymously entitled &quot;Kagaku Ninja-tai Gatchaman&quot; and is best known in the English-speaking world as the adaptation entitled &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; (1978). The series had additional English adaptations with &quot;G-Force: Guardians of Space&quot; (1986) and the 2005 ADV Films uncut release. Tatsunoko also uses the official translation &quot;Science Commando Gatchaman&quot; in related products and media.

The original &quot;Kagaku Ninja-tai Gatchaman&quot; series was followed by an animated film and two direct sequel series, &quot;Gatchaman II&quot; (1978) and &quot;Gatchaman Fighter&quot; (1979). During the 1990s, episodes from both series were dubbed into English by Saban as &quot;Eagle Riders&quot;.

In the years since, the franchise has spawned many different productions, some that were left unproduced or evolved significantly from its development. This includes a 1994 original animated video remake, an unproduced 1998 television remake, a cancelled 2011 animated film reboot by Imagi Animation Studios, a 2013 Japanese live-action film reboot by Nikkatsu Studios, various spinoffs, re-imaginings, and merchandise.

==Original series==

===Plot===
Recurring themes of &quot;Gatchaman&quot; involve conservation, environmentalism and the responsible use of technology for progress. The series centers around five young superhero ninja employed by Kōzaburō Nambu of the fictitious International Science Organization to oppose an international terrorist organization of technologically advanced villains (Galactor) who are trying to control Earth&#x27;s natural resources, such as water, oil, sugar and uranium. The leader of Galactor is an androgynous, masked antagonist named Berg Katse, who is later revealed to be a shape-shifting mutant acting on the orders of an alien superior (Leader X). Their mechas are often animal-based.

Most of the team are in their late teens, except for Jinpei (who is about ten or eleven years old). They include &quot;Ken Washio&quot;, the team leader and tactical expert; &quot;Jō Asakura&quot;, his second-in-command marksman and weapons expert; &quot;Jun&quot;, the team&#x27;s electronics and demolitions expert; &quot;Jinpei&quot;, the youngest and the reconnaissance expert as well as an adopted brother of Jun; and &quot;Ryū Nakanishi&quot;, the ship&#x27;s pilot. The main characters wear teen clothing with T-shirts numbered to show their rank in the team or caped, birdlike battle uniforms. The Science Ninja Team is often aided by a squadron of combat pilots led by the enigmatic Red Impulse, who is later revealed as Ken&#x27;s father.

The Gatchaman team employs a unique and effective martial art developed by Dr. Nambu, drawing on their ability to perform feats similar to their avian namesakes, such as high-speed running, flight, high jumping, and silent attacks. This fighting system, known as , is mentioned in the Japanese lyrics of the &quot;Gatchaman&quot; theme. The team members also use signature weapons and mecha-style vehicles, each with a mundane, disguised form. To change modes, each member is equipped with a wrist device that, in addition to communications and tracking, enables a change when the proper gesture and voice command (&quot;Bird, go!&quot;) is given.

Their vehicles are docked in the team&#x27;s main vehicle: the God Phoenix, a supersonic plane capable of underwater travel and space flight. The God Phoenix is armed with Bird Missiles, which are fired from a rack mounted atop the center section. After the original God Phoenix is destroyed by an octopus mecha, an improved version carries a pair of Super Bird Missiles in twin drop-down pods on the bottom center section. The ship also has an energy-beam weapon that opens the nose doors for the weapon apparatus mounted on the frame holding Joe&#x27;s car; however, its solar power source is unreliable because of its sensitivity to cloud cover. The plane can also temporarily transform into a massive bird of flame (like the legendary phoenix) to escape danger or attack, although the process endangers the team because of extreme pressure in the passenger cabin and it consumes a great deal of fuel.

===Characters===




===Episodes===
===Production===
Created in the wake of the Henshin (transformation) boom begun by Shotaro Ishinomori&#x27;s &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; in 1971, &quot;Gatchaman&quot; was conceived as a blending of ninja adventure with science fiction.

===Film version===
In 1978, Tatsunoko released a condensed theatrical compilation of the first two-story arcs in the series with additional new animation.

The film was released in English for the first time by Sentai Filmworks in 2015. The dub featured the cast reprising their roles from the ADV dub of the original TV anime for the film.

==Adaptations==
After its broadcast in Japan, &quot;Gatchaman&quot; was later exported to other countries and translated into several languages. In Taiwan, beginning in 1977 it was known as &quot;Ke Xue Xiao Fei Xia&quot; (/ &quot;kēxué xiǎofēixiá&quot;, &quot;Scientific Flying Fantasy Warriors&quot;).

The original series has seen several English adaptations with varying levels of modifications. Many of these versions later spawned foreign-language releases of their own:

===&quot;Battle of the Planets&quot;===

Sandy Frank and Jameson Brewer syndicated the series on American television in 1978, in heavily edited form, as &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; (&quot;BOTP&quot;). In this version, the team was known as G-Force and protected the Earth from constant threats from the planet Spectra. Several scenes were replaced with new segments by Gallerie International Films, with additional characters: the robot 7-Zark-7 and his associates, 1-Rover-1 (a robot dog) and Susan (a sentient computer), all of which were stationed at the outpost Centre Neptune and provided both comic relief and linking narrative to the wider story. Other segments included the Phoenix flying in space. The quality of the new segments did not match the original content, with the G-Force and 7-Zark-7 never actually appearing together. New music by Hoyt Curtin was blended with the original soundtrack. Although all 105 episodes of &quot;Gatchaman&quot; were used as sources, only 85 episodes of BOTP were produced. An animated TV movie was made, combining several episodes into a new storyline. In 2003, Sandy Frank announced a series of eight compilation films that ultimately went unreleased.

&quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; was released on VHS and DVD from 2001 to 2003 by Rhino Entertainment in six volumes and a complete DVD collection. The DVDs included a subtitled version of the corresponding Japanese episodes, alongside a single episode of the later English adaptation, &quot;G-Force&quot;. When Sentai Filmworks acquired the rights to &quot;Gatchaman&quot; in 2014, &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; became available to stream on The Anime Network and temporarily on Hulu.

====&quot;Battle of the Planets: Phoenix Ninjas&quot;====
&quot;Battle of the Planets: Phoenix Ninjas&quot; is a scrapped reboot of the first American adaptation of &quot;Science Ninja Team Gatchaman&quot;. Tatsunoko partnered up with d-rights and Nelvana, a Canadian animation company owned by Corus Entertainment, on the project. The last new information on the project was in 2016 and it appears to be canceled.

===&quot;G-Force: Guardians of Space&quot;===

With &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; ending its syndicated run and broadcast standards becoming laxer, a second English translation from Turner Program Services and Fred Ladd, by license of Sandy Frank, was produced. Entitled &quot;G-Force: Guardians of Space&quot;, this adaptation consisted of 85 episodes, spanning episodes 1–87 but skipping episodes 81 and 86. The series aired internationally beginning in 1987, but would not air in its entirety in the U.S until its run on Cartoon Network in 1995 &amp; Air on toonami&#x27;s midnight run in 2000. Although this version was less heavily edited and had a relatively faithful translation, the voice acting, background music and the Americanized character names were criticized.

A single episode from &quot;G-Force&quot; was included as a bonus on Rhino&#x27;s individual &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; DVDs released through 2001 and 2003. Seven more episodes were released in a 2004 best-of collection, making 13 out of the show&#x27;s 85 episodes available on disc.

===&quot;Battle of the Planets: The New Exploits of G-Force&quot;===
Development began for an uncensored version of &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot;. An animated TV movie was made (Battle of the Planets: The Movie, featuring David Bret Edgen as Zark), combining several episodes into a new storyline. In 2003, Sandy Frank announced a series of 8 compilation films that ultimately went unreleased. 
Sandy Frank announced a third English adaptation of the series in 2003 that was also never released. &quot;Battle of the Planets: The New Exploits of G-Force&quot; was set to be a 52-episode series encompassing content from the first 85 episodes of &quot;Gatchaman&quot;, the 20 previously unlocalized ones , and new CG animation produced by JulesWorld (including 7-Zark-7). The series would have been recorded at Ocean Studios in Vancouver, Canada and would have featured a new score and script to help modernize the show and create a tone in-between the two prior adaptations. While never released, the twenty-second episode of &quot;Gatchaman&quot; was adapted into a pilot called &quot;The Sea Dragon&quot;. It received two forms: one that focused on adventure and action and another that focused on comedy. At the time, this rendition of the show was sold as &quot;Battle of the Planets: The New Adventures of G-Force&quot;.

==DVD releases==
At Anime Central 2004, ADV Films announced that it had acquired the rights to release the series. In 2005, ADV released on DVD in 18 volumes (and nine limited-edition sets) containing a new uncut English dub and original Japanese audio with English subtitles under the name &quot;Gatchaman&quot;. This release included all 105 episodes. The dub aimed to be a faithful translation, without attempts to modify the show for younger viewers. The English dub contained creative changes: profanity, 1970s slang and thick, occasionally stereotypical accents were added. The series was released on Blu-ray and DVD in Japan on October 19, 2012.

In 2007, Sandy Frank&#x27;s long-term contract with Tatsunoko Productions (owners of the &quot;Gatchaman&quot; franchise), which gave it all domestic U.S rights to the first &quot;Gatchaman&quot; series and its English adaptations, lapsed and all video releases went out of print. Sentai Filmworks, a company founded by the creators of ADV, later signed a contract with Tatsunoko, acquiring the North American home video rights to the &quot;Gatchaman&quot; franchise in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sentai TV/OVA License&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Section23 Films released a complete collection of the series on Blu-ray and DVD on December 10, 2013. The Blu-ray set contains 14 discs in three keep cases, and the DVD set has 22 discs in four cases. Both sets contain all 105 episodes of the original series (with the ADV English version and Japanese audio).

==Other anime series==

===&quot;Gatchaman II&quot;===

A sequel, filmed with a different color process, was released four years later. Resembling the Blue Hawk, the new God Phoenix is larger and painted with the face of a bird. The personal mecha are also upgraded, with similar bird-designed paint jobs. Ryu has a tank-like mecha and a Pilot Machine to assist him.

&quot;Gatchaman II&quot; sees Sosai X turn a young shipwreck survivor into his newest commander Gel Sadra and resumes his plot to destroy the Earth. Gatchaman reunites with Joe, now a cyborg, after Galactor sends a spy to serve as his replacement on the team. The group is also aided by Dr. Pandora, who is revealed to be Gel Sadra&#x27;s mother.

In the end, Sosai X is destroyed by Joe and Gel Sadra dies after betraying Sosai X, after the villain murders her mother.

Episodes from this series and &quot;Gatchaman Fighter&quot; were combined and translated into English as &quot;Eagle Riders&quot; in 1996 by Saban Entertainment. &quot;Gatchaman II&quot; served as the bulk of the series, though its ending is changed to have Gel Sadra turn into Gatchaman Fighter villain Egoblauser.

Another release in South Korea is Eagle 5 Brothers (독수리 5 형제, Dokksuri Hyeongje) which does not contain unusual changes in audio. Instead, it contains visual changes.

===&quot;Gatchaman Fighter&quot;===

This series aired in 1979, immediately after &quot;Gatchaman II&quot;. Here, the team&#x27;s mecha bear no resemblance to birds. Earth is again threatened by evil; the mad tyrant Egoblauser (who has usurped control over the shattered forces of Galactor) and Sosai X, who has been reborn as Sosai Z.

Unlike &quot;Gatchaman II&quot;, &quot;Gatchaman Fighter&quot; is a much darker series, especially in the final episodes with regards to casualties and deaths of longtime series characters. The ending itself has Gatchaman presumed dead, sacrificing their lives to destroy Sosai X once and for all.

Select episodes from this series and &quot;Gatchaman II&quot; were combined and translated into English as &quot;Eagle Riders&quot; in 1996 by Saban Entertainment.

===&quot;Gatchaman&quot; (OVA)===

A 1994 original video animation remake series produced in association with Artmic that featured updated character designs and altered backgrounds.

Urban Vision released it on VHS in 1997 and DVD in 2001 with an English dub produced by Harmony Gold and Japanese audio with English subtitles. In 2013, Sentai Filmworks licensed the series and produced a new English dub from Seraphim Digital with the same cast as their ADV/Sentai&#x27;s releases of the original series and film. The new dub was released on DVD and Blu-Ray and is available for streaming on The Anime Network.

===&quot;New Gatchaman&quot;===
 is a project that was attempted around the same time that &quot;Mach Go Go Go &#x27;97&quot; was made. This version of &quot;Speed Racer&quot; was not so successful and as a result, it was canceled along with the project of &quot;Gatchaman &#x27;98&quot;.

===&quot;NTT/SMAP Gatchaman&quot;===

NTT Gatchaman was a series of commercials that were made to promote the Internet service provider NTT-East in fall 2000. Some of the commercials featured Japanese boy band group SMAP portraying live action versions of the characters, while the other two were animated by Tatsunoko Production and featured modernized costume redesigns of the Science Ninja Team. The animated commercials were directed by Keiichi Sato, with character designs by Kenji Hayama. A light novel based on these commercials were sent by e-mail by NTT-East as a gift for new subscribers. To this date, the contents of this light novel remain unknown. 
Based on sketches found on the Internet, fans have speculated if the commercials were an attempt to revive the franchise with a new anime. However, no such series was made at that time, and the franchise would not receive any new animated material for thirteen years until &quot;Gatchaman Crowds&quot;.

===&quot;Good Morning Ninja Team Gatchaman&quot;===

In 2011, Tatsunoko produced a series of 200 two-minute animated shorts called for broadcast on NTV&#x27;s &quot;Zip!&quot; television series. While the series used the original&#x27;s designs, it was more comedic in nature and featured none of the original actors. The characters were instead voiced by Scha Dara Parr&#x27;s Bose and Ani, along with actor Tomu Miyazaki.

Additional shorts were produced in promotion of the Japanese launch of &quot;Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate&quot;.

===&quot;Gatchaman Crowds&quot;===

A reboot of the Gatchaman series premiered in July 2013 on NTV. The story is set in Tachikawa City, Tokyo, where some of its residents have been chosen to join a team to confront a mysterious entity known as MESS. The series follows Hajime Ichinose, a 16-year-old girl who is the team&#x27;s newest member. A second season, titled &quot;Gatchaman Crowds insight&quot;, started airing on July 6, 2015.

As it aired in Japan, both seasons of the show were simulcast on Crunchyroll. Sentai Filmworks licensed and dubbed both seasons. They released them on home video between 2014 and 2016.

===Crossovers===

Ken the Eagle and Jun the Swan, along other Tatsunoko superheroes were featured on the PlayStation video game &quot;Tatsunoko Fight&quot; developed by Takara and released in 2000.

Super deformed animal versions of the &quot;Gatchaman&quot; team appeared alongside similar renditions of Tatsunoko&#x27;s &quot;Casshan&quot; and &quot;Golden Lightan&quot; in . The 26-episode anime series ran on Yomiuri TV between from October 4, 2010 and March 28, 2011.

On March 26, 2016, Tatsunoko announced a collaboration with Digital Frontier to create the &quot;Infini-T Force&quot; 3D CGI anime project. The team features members from &quot;Gatchaman&quot; alongside &quot;&quot;, &quot;Casshan&quot; and &quot;Hurricane Polymar&quot;. Set for release in 2017 alongside Tatsunoko&#x27;s 55th anniversary, the project will contain an original story and will not be an adaptation of Ukyō Kodachi and Tatsuma Ejiri&#x27;s manga series.

==Film adaptations==

===Canceled Imagi film===
Imagi began developing a film version in 2004, with producer Tom Gray saying that it would have a PG-13 or R rating. A &quot;Gatchaman&quot; film was first announced in February 2006, with an expected 2008 release. Kevin Munroe (&quot;TMNT&quot;) was scheduled to write and direct, with Lynne Southerland (co-director of &quot;Mulan 2&quot;) as producer, and an initial treatment was begun. However, in 2008 Munroe was taken off the project to direct &quot;Dylan Dog&quot;. Although early scripts were written by Paul Dini, in fall 2007 he was released from the project. In June 2007, Robert Mark Kamen was signed to write the screenplay in preparation for a 2008 release.

At the July 2008 Comic-Con, Imagi introduced a Paul Dini-scripted trailer. In August, art director Felix Ip began posting screenshots from the trailer. At the July 2009 Anime Expo, Imagi shared another 45-second, Dini-scripted trailer. Although it did not reveal much plot, it was the first public look at the 3D characterizations of the main villain Galactor and the Gatchaman team in and out of costume. The trailer also introduced the film&#x27;s theme: &quot;A world in chaos, an alien evil, a lone warrior is found; Earth&#x27;s last hope, five shall rise, Gatchaman.&quot; In July 2009 Imagi posted a new one-minute trailer for &quot;Gatchaman&quot; on its company website, with a release date of 2011.

In December 2009, auditors reported growing concerns with the half-year results posted by Imagi. Although the company said that it was on course for the release of &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, according to the audit firm &quot;It is uncertain whether the group will have the necessary financial resources to complete [the films] &quot;Gatchaman&quot;, &quot;Tusker&quot;, and &quot;Cat Tale&quot;.&quot; In January 2009 the auditing firm announced that the studio lacked funding for the release of &quot;Tusker&quot;, &quot;Cat Tale&quot; and &quot;Gatchaman&quot;, although Felix Ip reported that &quot;Gatchaman&quot; was expected to be released later in 2009. In June 2009, Imagi opened &quot;Gatchaman&quot; for licensing and announced a planned 3-D theatrical release in 2011. On December 11, 2009 Imagi&#x27;s Hong Kong-based parent company, Imagi International Holdings Limited, laid off 100 employees. In January 2010 it announced that although the &quot;Gatchaman&quot; project would be delivered in 100-percent stereoscopic 3D, to safeguard working capital it would close its U.S. subsidiaries. The U.S. closure was finalized in late January, with about 30 staffers laid off and a few key personnel continuing as consultants as Imagi sought $30 million from investors for its animation projects. In February 2010 the parent company laid off another 300 employees, calling the layoffs temporary as it sought new investors. On June 21, 2011, Imagi announced in its annual report that the &quot;Gatchaman&quot; film project was cancelled.

===Nikkatsu film===

Nikkatsu Studios produced a live-action version of &quot;Gatchaman&quot; for Japan, which was released in August 2013.

===American live-action film===
It was announced at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2019 that Joe and Anthony Russo are producing a live-action &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; film through their production company, AGBO Studios with the possibility of directing.

==Character variations==
===Team variations in different versions===

==Legacy==

===Impact===
&quot;Gatchaman&quot; helped establish the convention of the five-member hero team emulated in later series, notably in the successful tokusatsu &quot;Super Sentai&quot; franchise (a genre exemplified by the English series adaptation of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise many years later). The Sentai series &quot;Chōjin Sentai Jetman&quot; was, in many ways, a homage to &quot;Gatchaman&quot;.

<text>The Jackson Generals were a professional baseball team located in Jackson, Tennessee. From 1998 to 2020, they were a part of Minor League Baseball&#x27;s Southern League (SL) as the Double-A affiliate of the Chicago Cubs (1998–2006), Seattle Mariners (2007–2016), and Arizona Diamondbacks (2017–2020). Known as the West Tenn Diamond Jaxx from 1998 to 2010, the team borrowed its Generals moniker from the original Jackson Generals in 2011. They played their home games at The Ballpark at Jackson, which opened in 1998. 

Jackson served as a farm club for three Major League Baseball franchises. Over 22 years of competition, the Generals have played in 3,053 regular season games and compiled a 1,553–1,500 win–loss record. They have qualified for the postseason on 10 occasions, winning 7 division titles and 4 Southern League championships. The team&#x27;s first came in 2000 as the Double-A affiliate of the Chicago Cubs. They won a second in 2016 while affiliated with the Seattle Mariners. Their two most-recent titles were won back-to-back in 2018 and 2019 with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Jackson has a postseason record of 39–31. Combining all 3,123 regular season and postseason games, the Generals have an all-time record of 1,592–1,531.

==History==

===Prior professional baseball in Jackson===
Professional baseball was first played in Jackson, Tennessee, in 1903 by the Jackson Railroaders of the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League. They were followed in the KITTY League by the Jackson Climbers in 1911 and the Jackson Blue Jays in 1924. The Blue Jays moved to the Tri-State League in 1925 as the Jackson Giants and became the Jackson Jays in 1926. The original Jackson Generals played in the KITTY League from 1935 to 1942 and 1950 to 1954. Jackson went without a team for the next 42 years.

===Chicago Cubs (1998–2006)===
Following the 1997 season, the Southern League&#x27;s Memphis Chicks relocated from nearby Memphis, to Jackson as the West Tenn Diamond Jaxx. The team&#x27;s nickname was selected from over 1,500 suggestions submitted to &quot;The Jackson Sun&quot; in a name-the-team contest. The winning entry, &quot;Diamond Jacks&quot;, was inspired by a diamond shape on the contest entry blank. This was modified to &quot;Diamond Jaxx&quot; and paired with &quot;West Tenn&quot;, short for &quot;West Tennessee&quot; in which Jackson is located. The Diamond Jaxx became the Double-A affiliate of the Chicago Cubs. The team would play their home games at the newly constructed 6,000-seat Pringles Park, which cost approximately US$8 million.

The West Tenn Diamond Jaxx opened their inaugural season on the road against the Jacksonville Suns on April 2, 1998, at Wolfson Park in Jacksonville, Florida, winning 6–4. They played their home opener on April 16 before a sellout crowd of 6,054 people at Pringles Park. Tied 4–4 in the bottom of the ninth inning with the bases loaded, Jackson&#x27;s Terry Joseph was hit by a pitch forcing in the winning run in the 5–4 victory. Managed by Dave Trembley, the Diamond Jaxx ended their first season in fourth place in the Western Division with a 66–74 record.

Jackson hosted the 1999 Southern League All-Star Game on June 23. In the midsummer contest, the Western Division All-Stars defeated the Eastern Division, 5–2, with 4,169 in attendance. On July 22, David Manning pitched a no-hitter against Jacksonville at Pringles Park, a 1–0 win. The Diamond Jaxx won both the First and Second Half Western Division titles that season, with a league-leading 84–57 record, qualifying for the postseason playoffs. They won the division title by defeating the Chattanooga Lookouts, 3–1, in a best-of-five series. They were, however, defeated in finals by the Orlando Rays, 3–1. Trembley was selected for the Southern League Manager of the Year Award. 

The Diamond Jaxx returned to the postseason in 2000 under the leadership of Manager of the Year Dave Bialas after winning the second half and posting a league-best 80–58 mark. They won the Western Division title versus the Birmingham Barons, 3–2, then won their first Southern League championship by defeating Jacksonville, 3–2.

They won another second half title in 2002, but were eliminated in the Western Division series by Birmingham, 3–2. Jackson missed the playoffs for the next two seasons, including the 2004 campaign in which second baseman Richard Lewis won the Southern League Most Valuable Player Award. They won both halves of the 2005 season and won the Northern Division title versus the Carolina Mudcats, 3–0, but lost the championship to Jacksonville, 3–1. Jackson led the league with an 83–56 record. Ricky Nolasco was selected for the 2005 Southern League Most Outstanding Pitcher Award.

At the 2006 Southern League All-Star Game, Jackson third baseman Scott Moore was selected as the game&#x27;s MVP. Following the 2006 season, the Chicago Cubs ended their nine-year affiliation with the Diamond Jaxx, citing poor attendance and a desire for their Double-A players to compete before larger audiences. Jackson had a composite record of 655–598 through nine seasons with the Cubs.

===Seattle Mariners (2007–2016)===
The Diamond Jaxx entered into an affiliation with the Seattle Mariners in 2007. The finished that season with a 60–79 record. In October 2007, team owners Lozinak Baseball Properties entered into an agreement to sell the Diamond Jaxx to a group of Middle Tennessee-based investors headed by Reese Smith III and David Freeman. The new owners planned to keep the team in Jackson and sought to improve attendance. The sale was approved at the Winter Meetings that December.

Jackson won the First Half Northern Division title in 2008, but lost the division series to Carolina, 3–0. The 2010 team, lost the Northern Division title to the Tennessee Smokies, winners of both halves, 3–1.

During the 2010 playoffs, the team announced plans to rebrand for the 2011 season by becoming the Jackson Generals. The moniker was previously used by the original Jackson Generals, who represented the city in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League from 1935 to 1942 and 1950 to 1954. The Generals hosted their second Southern League All-Star Game on June 21, 2011. The North Division All-Stars defeated the South Division, 6–3, before a crowd of 5,516 at Pringles Park.

After missing the playoffs in 2011, the 2012 Generals won the First Half Northern Division title and posted a league-leading 79–61 record. They then defeated the Chattanooga Lookouts, 3–1, to advance to their first league championship series since 2005. They lost the finals to the Mobile BayBears, 3–1. Brandon Maurer was selected as the season&#x27;s Most Outstanding Pitcher. Losing campaigns from 2013 to 2015, including a franchise-low 53–84 (.387) record in 2015, kept the Generals from the playoffs for three consecutive years, the longest postseason drought in franchise history.

The 2016 Generals, managed by Daren Brown, led the league with a franchise-best 84–55 (.604) mark, winning the first half title. They won the Northern Division title against the Montgomery Biscuits, 3–1, before winning their second Southern League crown over the Mississippi Braves, 3–0. Jackson swept the Southern League awards with outfielder Tyler O&#x27;Neill winning the MVP Award, Ryan Yarbrough as the Most Outstanding Pitcher, and Brown winning the Manager of the Year Award.

The Generals ended their affiliation with the Seattle Mariners after the playoffs, intending to partner with a new major league team. Over 10 years as a Mariners affiliate, the Diamond Jaxx/Generals accumulated a record of 674–712. Over all 19 years in Jackson, the team had an all-time record of 1,329–1,310.

===Arizona Diamondbacks (2017–2020)===
The Generals next affiliated with the Arizona Diamondbacks in a player development contract that began with the 2017 season. They missed the playoffs in their first season with Arizona, but first baseman Kevin Cron won the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award. On June 14, 2018, five Generals combined to pitch a no-hitter against Jacksonville on the road. Justin Donatella (3 innings pitched), Daniel Gibson (2 IP), Kirby Bellow (1 IP), Kevin Ginkel (2 IP), and Brad Goldberg (1 IP) held the Suns hitless for nine innings in the 6–0 win. The team went on to win back-to-back Southern League championships in 2018 and 2019. Jackson won the 2018 first half, defeated Montgomery, 3–2, for the Northern Division title, then won the franchise&#x27;s third league title with a 3–1 series win over the Biloxi Shuckers. 

The 2019 team did not win either half of the season, but received a postseason berth with the Northern Division&#x27;s second-best overall record. Similar to the previous year, the Generals bested the Biscuits, 3–1 in the division series, then won their fourth Southern League championship versus the Shuckers, 3–2.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. Jackson was scheduled to host the 2020 Southern League All-Star Game at The Ballpark at Jackson, but it was cancelled earlier on May 19.

Through three years of affiliation with Arizona, the Generals&#x27; record was 224–190. Over all 22 years of competition, they had an all-time record of 1,553–1,500.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues after the 2020 season, the Generals were not invited to serve as any team&#x27;s affiliate, effectively ending their affiliation with the Diamondbacks and their run in affiliated baseball. The future of the team is uncertain. While Major League Baseball has stated its intentions to assist cities like Jackson in joining independent baseball leagues, the team&#x27;s lease requires them to maintain a Class A, Double-A, or Triple-A affiliation to remain at their ballpark.

With no team lined up for 2021, the Generals agreed to operate The Ballpark at Jackson as a temporary home for the Winnipeg Goldeyes, an independent American Association team based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, which was displaced due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. However, Jackson Mayor Scott Conger notified the teams that the Generals lost their authority to manage the city-owned ballpark when they lost their affiliation with Minor League Baseball and that they were issued an eviction notice to leave the stadium after May 30, nine days after the Goldeyes&#x27; May 21 home opener. On June 1, the Goldeyes entered into a new license agreement with the city to continue use of the facility. Meanwhile, the Generals and the City of Jackson went to an arbiter to decide which party had legal control of the stadium. The arbiter ruled in favor of the city, determining the Generals&#x27; lease to be invalid after the loss of its affiliation and requiring the team to vacate the ballpark. The city plans to host a team of the collegiate summer Prospect League in 2023. The team will be called the Jackson Rockabillys.

==Season-by-season results==

Jackson&#x27;s best season record occurred in 2016, when they finished 84–55 (.604) as an affiliate of the Seattle Mariners. Their lowest season record has been 53–84 (.387) in 2015, also as a Mariners affiliate. Of the three Major League Baseball teams with which Jackson has been affiliated, they have experienced their best record with the Arizona Diamondbacks from 2017 to 2020. The team has a composite regular season record of 224–190 (.541). They have reached the postseason on two occasions, winning two division titles and two Southern League championships. Their postseason record has been 12–6 (.667). Conversely, the team&#x27;s lowest record has been with the Mariners from 2007 to 2016. They compiled a 674–712 (.486) record and reached the postseason on four occasions, winning two division titles and one league championship. Their postseason record was 11–11 (.500).



==Television and radio==
All Jackson Generals games were shown on MiLB.TV. All games were also broadcast on radio by Radio Willie 94.1 FM and 1390 AM with sportscaster Tyler Springs handling the play-by-play since 2017.

==Awards==

Six Generals players won Southern League awards in recognition for their performance with Jackson. Three won Most Valuable Player Awards, while three won the Most Outstanding Pitcher Award. Three managers won the Manager of the Year Award. The team also won one Executive of the Year Award. Altogether, the Generals won 10 Southern League awards.

<text>The Battle of Jieting was fought between the states of Cao Wei and Shu Han in 228 during the Three Kingdoms period in China. The battle was part of the first Northern Expedition led by Shu&#x27;s chancellor-regent, Zhuge Liang, to attack Wei. The battle concluded with a decisive victory for Wei.

==Opening moves==
Zhuge Liang first sent generals Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi as a decoy force to Ji Valley () and pretend to attack Mei County (; southeast of present-day Fufeng County, Shaanxi) via Xie Valley () as a way to lure the main Wei forces of the region, while Zhuge Liang personally led a force towards Mount Qi. Cao Zhen led his army to oppose Zhao Yun while the three Wei-controlled commanderies – Nan&#x27;an (; around present-day Longxi County, Gansu), Tianshui and Anding (; around present-day Zhenyuan County, Gansu) – responded to the Shu invasion by defecting to the Shu side.

People of Wei saw Liu Bei as the main hero of Shu Han. Following his death, there were a few years of peace. Thus, the western lands were unprepared for such a dire situation. When they learned that there was a massive risk of losing the Guanzhong region. Cao Rui, the emperor of Wei, personally moved to Chang&#x27;an and assembled a secondary force under Zhang He to attack Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang chose generals Ma Su as the vanguard commander along with Wang Ping to intercept Zhang He, rather than the suggested veterans officers Wei Yan or Wu Yi.

==Battle==

Jieting was a crucial region for securing supplies, and Zhuge Liang sent Ma Su and Wang Ping to guard the region. Ma Su went accompanied by Wang Ping but did not listen to his sound military advice. Relying purely on books of military tactics, Ma Su chose to &quot;take the high ground&quot; and set up his base on the mountains instead of in a city as instructed by Zhuge Liang. He also ignored Wang Ping&#x27;s advice to make camp in a valley well supplied with water. Wang Ping, however, managed to persuade Ma Su to give him command of a portion of the troops, and Wang Ping set up his base camp near Ma Su&#x27;s camp, in order to offer assistance when Ma Su was in danger.

Due to this tactical mistake, the Wei army led by Zhang He encircled the hill, cut off the water supply to the Shu troops and defeated them. Amidst the panic, Ma Su is recorded to have left his post, leaving the army with no commander. Wang Ping rallied Ma Su&#x27;s army and with only a handful of soldiers did his best to keep the retreat organized. He ordered his soldiers to beat their drums loudly to create the impression that reinforcements had arrived. Zhang He believed this to possibly be a sign of an ambush and so he did not pursue. When Zhuge Liang arrived, he attempted to defeat Zhang He; however, he did not find a way to win and so the Shu army had to retreat to Hanzhong. 

Though he survived the battle, Ma Su&#x27;s army suffered a heavy defeat. (Wang Ping was able to rally Ma Su&#x27;s remaining troops and gather the Shu army&#x27;s scattered supplies.) Thus, Ma Su was arrested and sentenced to execution by a reluctant and tearful Zhuge Liang.

==Aftermath==
A large number of Shu Han&#x27;s generals were punished. Ma Su was sentenced to death by Zhuge Liang as a way to soothe the masses. Zhang Xiu () and Li Sheng () were also executed. According to the &quot;Jin Shu&quot;, Chen Shou&#x27;s father was implicated and sentenced to (), a punishment involving the shaving of a person&#x27;s head. Xiang Lang was dismissed from his position as chief clerk because he did not report that Ma Su fled due to their friendship. Huang Xi () and other generals were relieved of the command of their soldiers by Zhuge Liang. Wang Ping, on the other hand, was promoted to General Who Attacks Bandits () for his efforts in minimizing casualties and for trying to prevent Ma Su&#x27;s actions. Zhuge Liang himself sent a memorial to the Emperor Liu Shan requesting to be demoted for the defeat at Jieting, which he was.

Before his execution, Ma Su wrote a letter to Zhuge Liang: &quot;You wise lord regarded me like a son and myself looked upon you as a father. I dearly hope that this is the righteousness of the execution of Gun leading to the rise of Yu the Great. May our whole life&#x27;s relationship not be reduced by this. Though I shall die, I shall bear no resentments against the yellow earth.&quot; At the time, many among the army wept for his death.

Because of the loss of Jieting, the supply situation became dire for Zhuge Liang&#x27;s army and he had to retreat to his main base at Hanzhong while the Wei forces under Cao Zhen and Zhang He then used the opportunity to quell the rebellions in the three commanderies and restore peace. The defeat at Jieting caused the First Northern Expedition to result in failure.

== Location ==
The exact location of the battle is not certain; according to research by the &quot;&quot; newspaper, there are several plausible locations:

* Jieting village, Maiji District, southeast of Tianshui
* Gongmen town, east of Zhangjiachuan County
* Jieting Mountain in Mian County, Shaanxi Province
* Longcheng town, east of Qin&#x27;an County, Gansu
* Other locations named by some are Huating and Zhuanglang

A memorial of the battle is located in Longcheng town. Topographical evidence and weapons found suggest that Longcheng is the most likely location, although there is no consensus among experts. 

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Ma Su was executed on the order of a tearful Zhuge Liang, whose continued high appraisal for Ma&#x27;s intelligence made that a very reluctant decision. The scene has also been reenacted in Chinese opera. A Chinese proverb, &quot;wiping away tears and executing Ma Su&quot; (), refers specifically to this incident, meaning &quot;punishing a person for his wrongdoings regardless of relations or his abilities. A Japanese equivalent is .

In the novel, the loss of Jieting exposed Zhuge Liang&#x27;s current location, the defenceless Xicheng (). Zhuge Liang used the Empty Fort Strategy to ward off the enemy before retreating.

In many stories, including the novel, the battle includes Sima Yi on the Wei side, but this event is impossible according to his biography in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. Moss Roberts comments on this in his fourth volume of his English translation of &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; on (page 2179 under Chapter 95 Notes, fourth and last paragraph of the chapter notes):

In the abstract theory above, Roberts explains and compares historic history with fictional tales and the most likely reason Sima Yi was included before the Battle of Mount Qi. Based on Robert&#x27;s view of the fictional novel&#x27;s tendency to build up the rivalry between Sima Yi and Zhuge Liang, and the contradiction of Sima Yi&#x27;s location at the time of this event, some share Robert&#x27;s opinion that the event did not happen. However, many historians agree that Sima Yi&#x27;s absence alone cannot disprove the occurrence. The historical basis for the event comes from an anecdote shared by Guo Chong () in the early Jin dynasty (266–420). The anecdote is translated as follows:

&quot;Zhuge Liang garrisoned at Yangping (; around present-day Hanzhong, Shaanxi) and ordered Wei Yan to lead the troops east. He left behind only 10,000 men to defend Yangping. Sima Yi led 200,000 troops to attack Zhuge Liang and he took a shortcut, bypassing Wei Yan&#x27;s army and arriving at a place 60 li away from Zhuge Liang&#x27;s location. Upon inspection, Sima Yi realised that Zhuge Liang&#x27;s city was weakly defended. Zhuge Liang knew that Sima Yi was near, so he thought of recalling Wei Yan&#x27;s army back to counter Sima Yi, but it was too late already and his men were worried and terrified. Zhuge Liang remained calm and instructed his men to hide all flags and banners and silence the war drums. He then ordered all the gates to be opened and told his men to sweep and dust the ground. Sima Yi was under the impression that Zhuge Liang was cautious and prudent, and he was baffled by the sight before him and suspected that there was an ambush. He then withdrew his troops. The following day, Zhuge Liang clapped his hands, laughed, and told an aide that Sima Yi thought that there was an ambush and had retreated. Later, his scouts returned and reported that Sima Yi had indeed retreated. Sima Yi was very upset when he found out later.&quot;

Later, in the fifth century, Pei Songzhi added the anecdote as an annotation to Zhuge Liang&#x27;s biography in the Sanguozhi. Since Zhuge Liang wrote on the use of this tactic in his compilation work, &quot;Thirty Six Stratagems&quot;, going so far as to detail how the psychology employed works, and why:

&quot;When the enemy is superior in numbers and your situation is such that you expect to be overrun at any moment, then drop all pretense of military preparedness, act calmly, and taunt the enemy, so that the enemy will think you have a huge ambush hidden for them. It works best by acting calm and at ease when your enemy expects you to be tense. This ploy is only successful if in most cases you do have a powerful hidden force and only sparsely use the empty fort strategy.&quot;

Also worthy of note is that Zhuge Liang wrote this passage in his sixth chapter, titled &quot;Desperate Stratagems&quot;, (／, ), further supporting the implication that he had experience in using this tactic, and his description does match the situation described by Guo Chong. However, there are a number of texts that dispute the accuracy of Guo Chong&#x27;s anecdote.

<doc id="475973" wikidata="Q1364104" url="?curid=475973" title="Sean Michaels (actor)">
<text>Sean Michaels (born February 20, 1958) is an American pornographic actor, model, director and former trade union leader. In 2002, &quot;AVN&quot; ranked him 14th on their list of &quot;The Top 50 Porn Stars of All Time&quot;. Michaels has won several prominent adult industry awards, including the NightMoves Award for Best Actor. He has also been inducted into the AVN, NightMoves, Urban X, and XRCO Halls of Fame.

==Early life==
Michaels was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Boys and Girls High School, the oldest public high school in Brooklyn. After moving to the West Coast, he worked as a nurse for an urgent care facility in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. He also did runway and print modeling prior to entering the porn industry.

==Career==
Michaels started out working in the adult entertainment industry as a model for skin magazines. Dissatisfied with the portrayal of black men in pornography, which he saw as &quot;very demeaning and stereotypical&quot;, Michaels began performing in adult films in 1989. Michaels chose his stage name by combining the first names of two male celebrities he admired: Sean Connery, whom he described as a &quot;man&#x27;s man, on and off camera&quot;, and Michael Jordan.

Michaels gained recognition in the industry after appearing in his mentor John Leslie&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;Oh What A Night&quot;. Micheals received the XBIZ Award for Woodsman of the Year in 1994. The following year, he was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame. In 1996, he started his own film studio, Sean Michaels Productions, which was later changed to Sean Michaels International the following year when Anabolic Video began handling its distribution.

Along with Lisa Ann and Nikki Benz, Michaels hosted the XRCO Awards in April 2010. In 2018, he performed in his first bisexual scene for Kick Ass Pictures. In regards to the scene, Michaels commented, &quot;I feel strongly about doing the things you want to do in life. Cuckold fans have been asking me for years to do bi scenes, and I&#x27;m happy to be making this move. I believe it&#x27;s important for people to grow sexually in any way they choose.&quot;

==Legal dispute==
In 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) issued Michaels a cease and desist letter, asking him to stop using his name due to the similarity it had to wrestler Shawn Michaels. Sean Michaels&#x27; name was already registered as a trademark, while Shawn Michaels had not registered his moniker. Michaels later announced he planned to countersue the WWE. As of April 1, 2011, the trademark of &quot;Sean Michaels&quot; is no longer active.

==Advocacy and impact==
In 2016, Michaels was elected President of the Adult Performance Artists Guild, then the Adult Performers Actors Guild (APAG). As President, he announced the APAG would push to raise the legal age to perform in adult films from 18 to 21, commenting that &quot;it&#x27;s 21 years old to drink, so you should have to be 21 to do porn.&quot; Amidst criticism from APAG members who saw him as reducing his union participation, Michaels officially resigned from his role. He was replaced in the role by actress Alana Evans, who had served as vice president under him. Evans revealed that Michaels was being &quot;blackballed&quot; in the pornographic industry due to his guild participation.

In the May 1997 issue of &quot;Vibe&quot;, he was labeled &quot;the preeminent force in interracial erotic entertainment.&quot; In her book &quot;A Taste for Brown Sugar: Black Women in Pornography&quot;, women&#x27;s studies scholar Mireille Miller-Young notes how Michaels&#x27; portrayal of &quot;suave and professional&quot; characters in his films has challenged the stereotyping of black men as &quot;sexual beasts&quot; in pornography and expanded opportunities for black performers. Violet Blue shares a similar sentiment in &quot;The Ultimate Guide to Adult Videos&quot;, calling Michaels a &quot;major force in changing the face and attitudes of the adult industry towards black performers.&quot; Blue concluded by dubbing him &quot;the most famous black man to ever appear in porn.&quot;

<doc id="475977" wikidata="Q1632425" url="?curid=475977" title="Can't Hardly Wait">
<text>Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait is a 1998 American teen romantic comedy film written and directed by Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont. It stars an ensemble cast including Ethan Embry, Charlie Korsmo, Lauren Ambrose, Peter Facinelli, Seth Green, and Jennifer Love Hewitt, and contains a number of &quot;before-they-were-famous&quot; appearances by teen stars. The story takes place at a high school graduation party.

The film received mixed reviews from critics. It grossed a total of $25 million at the North American domestic box office, against a production budget of $10 million. The soundtrack peaked at number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

==Concept==
The story takes place at a high school graduation party in the late 1990s and in a style much like that of the high school movies of the 1980s. The idea of setting most of the movie at a party was based primarily on concerns to keep production costs low and was also inspired by the movies of John Hughes and the party scene in &quot;Say Anything...&quot;.

The film takes its name from The Replacements&#x27; song of the same title, from their 1987 album &quot;Pleased to Meet Me&quot;, which plays over the film&#x27;s closing credits.

==Plot==
In 1998, the senior class of suburban high school Huntington Hillside High are attending a graduation party at the house of a rich class member. Among them is Preston Meyers, an outsider who plans to proclaim his secret four-year-long love to Amanda Beckett.

Amanda, the most popular girl in school and the senior class prom queen, has been dumped by popular jock Mike Dexter. His classmate William Lichter targets him, plotting revenge against Mike for years of bullying. Kenny Fisher is a wannabe thug who plans on losing his virginity by the end of the night.

Amanda is consoled by her popular girlfriends, but realizes she has nothing in common with them. She tries to figure out if she has an identity beyond only being known as &quot;Mike Dexter&#x27;s girlfriend&quot;.

Amanda discovers a letter addressed to her by Preston and, moved by its contents, makes it her mission to find him, though she does not know what he looks like and no one she asks gives any helpful descriptions. Meanwhile, Preston&#x27;s antisocial best friend Denise Fleming and Kenny accidentally lock themselves inside a bathroom away from the party, where they talk about their old friendship and how they had drifted apart. Their conversation leads to the restoration of their friendship and escalates into them having sex.

A graduate from Mike&#x27;s high school, Trip McNeely, tells him that guys like them are &quot;a dime a dozen&quot; in college. Trip emphasizes how he dumped his girlfriend in the same fashion that Mike did to &quot;score&quot; with other women and was unsuccessful. Terrified of this prospect, Mike tries to get Amanda back, but she is happier without him and humiliates him in front of everyone there.

After seeing the school jock turned down, multiple guys begin to hit on Amanda, much to her disgust. Preston finds her and professes his love, but as she still has not learned what he looks like, she assumes he is another pervert and rejects him in front of the entire party. Amanda later realizes her mistake when she sees Preston&#x27;s yearbook picture and tries to find him, but he has already driven home in disappointment.

Meanwhile, William devises his plan to get revenge on Mike and goes into the party to drive him out. While there, William begins drinking alcohol to fit in, drinking enough to make him forget why he was there. An impromptu sing-along to Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;Paradise City&quot; causes him to become popular, with multiple women trying to have sex with him.

William later begins talking with Mike, who apologizes for bullying him. After William forgives him, the two bond and seemingly become friends. When both are jailed as a result of a police bust, Mike takes the blame.

The next morning, when William sees Mike and his friends at a diner, he tries to thank him for taking the fall. However, Mike acts as though he remembers nothing that happened the previous night, and again ridicules him in front of his friends.

Meanwhile, Preston is at a train station about to leave for Boston when Amanda arrives and asks him about the letter. He confesses he wrote it and is about to depart for a writing workshop with Kurt Vonnegut. The two say goodbye and Preston walks away, but then stops and runs back to Amanda before the two kiss.

The epilogue explains what happens to all of the main characters:
* William becomes one of the most popular students at Harvard. He forms a computer company that makes him worth millions, and starts dating a supermodel.
* Mike goes to college but, after drinking too much, loses his football scholarship. He ends up forty pounds overweight and working at a car wash, a job he loses when incriminating Polaroids surface.
* The day after the party, Denise and Kenny go to a diner, where she dumps him five minutes later. Ten minutes pass before they find a bathroom and get back together.
* Seven hours later, Preston boards a train to Boston. Amanda writes him a letter for every day that he is away. They remain together.

==Cast==
==Production==
The script for &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot; was originally written in 1996, by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan who were looking for a project they could develop and direct themselves on a limited budget. The project was approved by Columbia Pictures in mid-1997, following the success of teen-oriented horror film &quot;Scream&quot; in early 1997. Principal photography for &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot; started in October 1997, and ran for 26 days. Jennifer Love Hewitt was known for &quot;Party of Five&quot; when she signed on to the film, and appeared in the slasher hit &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, which helped to further raise her profile. According to Charlie Korsmo, Adam Hann-Byrd was originally cast as William Lichter.

The cast had a week of rehearsals before filming.

The film initially received an R-Rating due to MPAA objections about the depiction of teens drinking alcohol at an unsupervised party and drug use. The film was recut to receive a PG-13 rating.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot; was released on June 12, 1998, and grossed $8,025,910 in its opening weekend. Its total domestic gross was $25,605,015, more than double its production budget.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 42% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Occasionally clever and moderately intelligent, &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot; also contains too many cheap laughs, recycled plotting, and flat characters.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;For all its nonstop energy and high spirits, &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot; allows its characters to emerge as fully dimensional individuals; they&#x27;ve been written with care and perception and played with equal aplomb by a roster of talented young actors&quot;.
Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot; has freshness, comic invention and an engaging romantic spirit.&quot;
Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote: &quot;But the film deserves credit, both for its breezy pacing and its uncommon tendency to make its characters smarter and geekier than they might have been.&quot;

Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film a &quot;mediocre attempt to recapture the exuberance and candid portraiture of such high school movie classics as &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; and &quot;Dazed and Confused.&quot;&quot; Levy praised the cast but was critical of the &quot;uneven script and rough direction&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4, and wrote: &quot;The kind of movie that somehow succeeds in moving very, very slowly even while proceeding at a breakneck pace. It cuts quickly back and forth between nothing and nothing... It doesn&#x27;t have the zing of life and subversion that the best high school movies always have.&quot;

===Awards===
In 2012, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot; number 44 on its list of the 50 Best High School Movies of all time.

* MTV Movie Awards
** Best Female Performance: (Jennifer Love Hewitt) Nominated
* Young Artist Awards
** Best Performance in a Feature Film — Leading Young Actress: (Jennifer Love Hewitt) Nominated

==Sequel==

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS and DVD on November 17, 1998. On September 30, 2008, it was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray as the &quot;10 Year Reunion Edition&quot; to commemorate the film&#x27;s 10th anniversary.

<text>Belle Isle is a 54 acre island in the city of Richmond, Virginia on the James River, and is part of the James River Park System. It is accessible to pedestrian and bicycle traffic via a suspension footbridge that runs under the Robert E. Lee Memorial Bridge from the northern shore or via a wooden bridge from the southern shore. Except when the water level of the James is high, it is also reachable by foot from the southern shore via easy boulder-hopping. From Belle Isle, one can see Hollywood Cemetery, the old Tredegar Iron Works, and Richmond City&#x27;s skyline. There are many bike trails around the island as well as a small cliff used for rock climbing instruction.

==History==
In the 1600s, the area of Richmond, Virginia, was part of the Tsenacommacah, a homeland of the Powhatan people.

Belle Isle was originally known as Broad Rock Island by the English. It was first mapped by European John Smith of Jamestown in 1607. In the 18th century the island was occupied by a fishery. In 1814, the Old Dominion Iron and Nail Company completed a nail factory. During the 1860s, the island was inhabited by a village complete with a school, church, and general store.

===Civil War===
The island served as a prison for Union soldiers during the American Civil War. Between 1862 and 1865, the island was home to about 30,000 POWs and as many as 1,000 died, though accounts vary with the South claiming the death rate was low, while the North claimed it was very high. The Battle of Walkerton was the result of a failed Union attempt to free them.

John L. Ransom, late First Sergeant Ninth Michigan Cavalry, published in 1881 his &#x27;Andersonville Diary&#x27; which includes his account of life as a prisoner on Belle Isle during the winter of 1863-1864. 
He described his arrival thus:

Arrived on the morning of Nov. 13th, seven days after capture, at the south end of the “long bridge,” ordered out of the cars and into line, counted off and started for Belle Isle. Said island is in the James River, probably covers ten or twelve acres, and is right across from Richmond. The river between Richmond and the island is probably a third or half a mile. The “long bridge” is near the lower part of the island. It is a cold, bleak piece of ground and the winter winds have free sweep from up the river. Before noon we were turned into the pen which is merely enclosed by a ditch and the dirt taken from the ditch thrown up on the outside, making a sort of breastwork. The ditch serves as a dead line, and no prisoners must go near the ditch. The prison is in command of a Lieut. Bossieux, a rather young and gallant looking sort of fellow. Is a born Southerner, talking so much like a negro that you would think he was one, if you could hear him talk and not see him. He has two rebel sergeants to act as his assistants, Sergt. Hight and Sergt. Marks. These two men are very cruel, as is also the Lieut. when angered. Outside the prison pen is a bake house, made of boards, the rebel tents for the accommodation of the officers and guard, and a hospital also of tent cloth. Running from the pen is a lane enclosed by high boards going to the water&#x27;s edge. At night this is closed up by a gate at the pen, and thrown open in the morning. About half of the six thousand prisoners here have tents while the rest sleep and live out of doors.

In 1864, Peter DeWitt, Assistant Surgeon at Jarvis Hospital, Baltimore, received a number of prisoners recently released from the Prisoner of War camp at Belle Isle. He described the &quot;great majority&quot; of the patients as being:
in a semi-state of nudity...laboring under such diseases as chronic diarrhoea, phthisis pulmonalis, scurvy, frost bites, general debility, caused by starvation, neglect and exposure. Many of them had partially lost their reason, forgetting even the date of their capture, and everything connected with their antecedent history. They resemble, in many respect, patients laboring under cretinism. They were filthy in the extreme, covered in vermin...nearly all were extremely emaciated; so much so that they had to be cared for even like infants.

In May 1864, Lucius Eugene Chittenden, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Abraham Lincoln was sent by the president to investigate freed prisoners from Belle Isle and gave his eyewitness account in, &quot;Recollections of President Lincoln and His Administration,&quot; published in the late 1890s. He related the shock Lincoln shared at learning that Union prisoners had been left by the Confederates to freeze and starve to death in the shadow of the Confederate Capital.

===Twentieth century to present===
The Virginia Electric Power Company built and operated a hydroelectric power plant on the island between 1904 and 1963. Which has now been left vacant along with many other buildings.

Belle Isle is briefly mentioned in Chapter III of MacKinlay Kantor&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the Civil War, &quot;Andersonville&quot; (1955). Conditions at the prison camp are described in more detail in Chapters IX and XIII.

The original Lee Bridge was built over the island in 1934 and replaced by the current version in 1988. Belle Isle was formally made into a park in 1973.

In the 2001 movie &quot;Hannibal&quot;, the power plant can be seen as Agent Starling runs across the bridge on the south side of the island.

Belle Isle offers Richmonders the opportunity to view wildlife in its natural habitat, at a location only a few minutes from the heart of the city. Songbirds, ducks, cormorants and blue herons are a common sight. Squirrels, other small mammals, amphibians and reptiles also inhabit the island. Some sections of trails are a part of the East Coast Greenway.

<text>Belle-Île (), Belle-Île-en-Mer (), or Belle Isle (, ; ) is a French island off the coast of Brittany in the &quot;département&quot; of Morbihan, and the largest of Brittany&#x27;s islands. It is from the Quiberon peninsula.

Administratively, the island is divided into four communes:
* Bangor
* Le Palais
* Locmaria
* Sauzon

Belle-Île formed a canton until 2015 when it was merged into the canton of Quiberon as part of a general overhaul.

==Geography==

The island measures and has an average elevation of . The area is about . The coasts are a mixture between dangerously sharp cliff edges on the southwest side, the &quot;Côte Sauvage&quot; (&quot;wild coast&quot;), and placid beaches, the largest being &quot;les Grands Sables&quot; (&quot;the great sands&quot;) and navigable harbours on the northeast side. The island&#x27;s climate is oceanic, having less rain and milder winters than on the mainland.

The two main ports are Le Palais (accessible by ferry from Quiberon, Port-Navalo and Vannes) and Sauzon (accessible by ferry from Quiberon and Lorient).

There used to be forests on the island, but these have long disappeared due to increasing agricultural use of the land.

===Climate===
Belle Île experiences a warm-summer Mediterranean climate.
==Demography==
At the 2009 census, the population of Belle Île was 4,920. However, in summer the population may increase to 25,000, with a peak at 35,000 between 15 July and 15 August due to tourist activity.


==History==

Belle Île was separated from the mainland about 6000 BC, earlier than the neighbouring islands of Houat and Hœdic. Archaeological finds from the Bronze Age suggest that the island enjoyed a large increase in population in this time, probably due to improvements in seafaring. It was then a naval base for the Veneti.

The Roman name of the island seems to have been &quot;Vindilis&quot;, which in the Middle Ages became corrupted to &quot;Guedel&quot;. During the ninth century Belle-Île belonged to the county of Cornouaille.
In 1572, the monks of the abbey of Ste Croix at Quimperlé ceded the island to the Retz family, in whose favour it was raised to a marquisate in the following year. It subsequently came into the hands of the family of Fouquet. The island&#x27;s fortifications were erected by Vauban on behalf of Nicolas Fouquet, prior to Fouquet incurring the displeasure of Louis XIV; the land was ceded to the crown in 1718.

===Seven Years&#x27; War===

The island was held by British troops from 1761, following its capture by an expedition sent out from England, to 1763, when it was returned to France in exchange for Menorca as part of the Peace of Paris. Because of the upheaval from the conflict, half the population had moved back to the mainland and the abandoned lands were offered to the deported Acadians who settled here in 1766.

The attacks on Belle Île and siege of Belle Île have been described by Olaudah Equiano () in his autobiography, &quot;The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The African&quot;, 1789, June 1792. His book was a bestseller in his own time. He became a central figure in the British abolitionist movement, as a forceful abolitionist lecturer, based on his own experiences as a former slave. Equiano gave a detailed eyewitness report of the attacks and siege.

Much of the island&#x27;s current population is descended from repatriated Acadian colonists who returned to France after being expelled from Acadia (1755–1764) during the Expulsion of the Acadians.

Today, Belle-Île&#x27;s population is about 5,300, and its economy is largely dependent on tourism and fishing.

==Culture==
During the summer the island&#x27;s population increases dramatically, as many people own a second home on the island due to its secluded location and beaches.

&quot;Lyrique en Mer/Festival de Belle Île&quot; is the largest opera festival in western France. Founded in 1998 by American opera singer Richard Cowan, the festival produces two staged operas every summer, conducted by Music Director Philip Walsh and directed by Mr. Cowan, the Artistic Director. Additionally, there are sacred concerts in all four of the island&#x27;s historic churches, as well as many smaller concerts and Master Classes. &quot;Lyrique en Mer&quot; has wide support from the French business community as well as from the &quot;Conseil Général&quot;, the &quot;Conseil Régional&quot;.

=== Depictions ===
The island has been a popular location for artists. Octave Penguilly L&#x27;Haridon&#x27;s 1859 painting &quot;Les Petites mouettes&quot; (&quot;Little Gulls&quot;) (1858, Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rennes) depicts the island. It was praised by Maxime Du Camp and Charles Baudelaire, who referred to the sense of the uncanny, as though the rocks make &quot;a portal open to infinity...a &quot;wound&quot; of white birds, and the solitude!&quot; During the 1870s and 1880s, French Impressionist painter Claude Monet painted the rock formations at Belle Île. Monet&#x27;s series of paintings of the rocks at Belle Île astounded the Paris art world when he first exhibited them in 1887. Most notable are the &quot;Storm, Coast at Belle-Ile&quot; and &quot;Cliffs at Belle-Ile&quot; both rendered in 1886. The first time Auguste Rodin saw the ocean off the Brittany coast he exclaimed, “It’s a Monet.&quot;

Australian born artist John Russell was a man of means and having married a beautiful Italian, Mariana Antoinetta Matiocco, he settled at Belle Île off the coast of Brittany where he established an artists&#x27; colony.
Russell had met Vincent van Gogh in Paris and formed a friendship with him. Van Gogh spoke highly of Russell&#x27;s work, and after his first summer in Arles in 1888 he sent twelve drawings of his paintings to Russell, to inform him about the progress of his work. Monet often worked with Russell at Belle Île and influenced his style, though it has been said that Monet preferred some of Russell&#x27;s Belle Île seascapes to his own. Russell did not attempt to make his pictures known.

In 1897 and 1898 Henri Matisse visited Belle Île. Russell introduced him to impressionism and to the work of Van Gogh (who was relatively unknown at the time). Matisse&#x27;s style changed radically, and he would later say &quot;Russell was my teacher, and Russell explained colour theory to me.&quot;

The island is the setting for portions of the novel &quot;The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later&quot;, Alexandre Dumas père&#x27;s second sequel to &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. Dumas has his character Aramis fortify the island (in place of Vauban, historically) and Porthos dies there, in the caves of Locmaria.

<doc id="475991" wikidata="Q7983281" url="?curid=475991" title="Werewolves of London">
<text>&quot;Werewolves of London&quot; is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Warren Zevon, written by Zevon, LeRoy Marinell and Waddy Wachtel. It first appeared on &quot;Excitable Boy&quot; (1978), Zevon&#x27;s third studio album, then it was released as a single by Asylum Records in March 1978, becoming a Top 40 US hit, the only one of Zevon&#x27;s career, reaching No. 21 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in May.

Inspired by Phil Everly, it includes Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s Mick Fleetwood on drums and John McVie on bass.

==Background and recording==
The song began as a joke by Phil Everly (of the Everly Brothers) to Zevon in 1975, over two years before the recording sessions for &quot;Excitable Boy&quot;. Everly had watched a television broadcast of the 1935 film &quot;Werewolf of London&quot; and &quot;suggested to Zevon that he adapt the title for a song and dance craze.&quot; Zevon played with the idea with his band members LeRoy P. Marinell and Waddy Wachtel, who wrote the song together in about 15 minutes, all contributing lyrics that were transcribed by Zevon&#x27;s wife Crystal. However, none of them took the song seriously.

Soon after, Zevon&#x27;s friend Jackson Browne saw the lyrics and thought &quot;Werewolves of London&quot; had potential and began performing the song during his own live concerts. T Bone Burnett also performed the song, on the first leg of Bob Dylan&#x27;s Rolling Thunder Revue tour in the autumn of 1975. Burnett&#x27;s version of the song included alternate or partially improvised lyrics mentioning stars from classical Hollywood cinema, along with mentions of vanished labor leader Jimmy Hoffa, and adult film stars Marilyn Chambers and Linda Lovelace. &quot;Excitable Boy&quot; and &quot;Werewolves of London&quot; were considered for, but not included on, Zevon&#x27;s second album &quot;Warren Zevon&quot; in 1976.

According to Wachtel, &quot;Werewolves of London&quot; was &quot;the hardest song to get down in the studio I&#x27;ve ever worked on.&quot; However, Wachtel &quot;laid down his solo in one take.&quot; They tried at least seven different configurations of musicians in the recording studio before being satisfied with McVie and Fleetwood&#x27;s contributions. Bob Glaub and Russ Kunkel were among the several musicians who auditioned; Zevon rejected them because he thought their playing was &quot;too cute&quot;. Although 59 takes were recorded, Browne and Zevon selected the second take for the final mix. Wachtel recalled that the session began in the evening and went into the next morning. The protracted studio time and musicians&#x27; fees led to the song eating up most of the album&#x27;s budget.
The song&#x27;s lyrics &quot;He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fook&#x27;s / Gonna get a big dish of beef chow mein&quot; refer to Lee Ho Fook, a Chinese restaurant that was at 15 Gerrard Street in London&#x27;s Chinatown, which is in the West End of London. It closed in 2008. Egon Ronay&#x27;s Dunlop Guide for 1974 discussed the restaurant and said it served Cantonese cuisine. In concerts, Zevon would often change the line &quot;You better stay away from him, he&#x27;ll rip your lungs out, Jim / I&#x27;d like to meet his tailor&quot;, to &quot;And he&#x27;s looking for James Taylor&quot;.

Over Zevon&#x27;s objections, Elektra Records chose &quot;Werewolves of London&quot; as the album&#x27;s first single (he preferred &quot;Johnny Strikes Up the Band&quot; or &quot;Tenderness on the Block&quot;). The song was a quick hit, staying in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 chart for over a month.

==Personnel==
*Warren Zevon – piano, vocals
*Mick Fleetwood – drums
*John McVie – bass
*Waddy Wachtel – guitars

==Reception and legacy==
BBC Radio 2 listeners rated it as having the best opening line in a song: &quot;I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand&quot;.

Zevon later said of the song, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why that became such a hit. We didn&#x27;t think it was suitable to be played on the radio. It didn&#x27;t become an albatross. It&#x27;s better that I bring something to mind than nothing. There are times when I prefer that it was &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think bad about the song. I still think it&#x27;s funny.&quot; He also described &quot;Werewolves of London&quot; as a novelty song, &quot;[but] not a novelty the way, say, Steve Martin&#x27;s &quot;King Tut&quot; is a novelty.&quot;

The song had a resurgence in popularity in 1986 due to its use in a scene in &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, where Tom Cruise dances and lip-syncs to the song in a scene in which Cruise &quot;displayed the depths of his talents at the billiards game of 9-ball.&quot;

After Zevon&#x27;s death in 2003, Jackson Browne stated that he interpreted the song as describing an upper-class English womanizer: &quot;It&#x27;s about a really well-dressed, ladies&#x27; man, a werewolf preying on little old ladies. In a way it&#x27;s the Victorian nightmare, the gigolo thing.&quot;

==Samples and other versions==
* The Grateful Dead covered the song in a number of live concerts in 1978, one of which was released on &quot;Red Rocks: 7/8/78&quot;. The group resurrected the song for Halloween night concerts in 1985, 1990, and 1991.
* David Lindley performed the song live in concert with Jackson Browne before it was released by Zevon. Lindley adapted the lyrics, taking some ideas from Burnett&#x27;s version, and released the song on the 1988 album, &quot;Very Greasy&quot; by Lindley and his band El Rayo X.
* Adam Sandler provided a version for the tribute album, &quot;Enjoy Every Sandwich: The Songs of Warren Zevon&quot; (October 2004). Sandler also performed it on the &quot;Late Show&quot; on December 15, 2004.
* American pop-rocker Masha covered the song for a Three Olives Vodka ad campaign in 2014.
*Dexy&#x27;s Midnight Runners song &quot;One of Those Things&quot; has a riff taken from &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;. For the 1997 re-release of the album &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand Me Down&quot;, Kevin Rowland admitted in the liner notes that he had used the riff and consequently Zevon and his co-writers, LeRoy Marinell and Waddy Wachtel, were given writing credits on the song.
* Kid Rock sampled this song in 2008 (and Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, which has a similar riff) on &quot;All Summer Long&quot; and credits Zevon as a songwriter.
* In 2017, Italian comedy-rock band Elio e le Storie Tese made an Italian version of this song, &quot;Licantropo Vegano&quot; (&quot;Vegan Werewolf&quot;); the difference with the original version is that the werewolf is vegan and the song is based in Milan, and not in London.

<text>Viktor Felixovich Vekselberg (born April 14, 1957) is a Russian-Israeli businessman and oligarch. He is the founder and chairman of Renova Group, a Russian conglomerate. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, as of November 2021, his fortune is estimated at $9.3 billion, making him the 262nd richest person in the world. Born in Ukraine, he has Russian, Israeli and Cypriot citizenship.

==Early life, family and education==
Viktor Vekselberg was born in 1957 to a Ukrainian Jewish father and a Russian mother in Drohobych, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (although some reports state that he was born in Lviv). All of Vekselberg&#x27;s family of seventeen fell victim to the Holocaust. They were murdered and buried in a mass grave during the Nazi repressions in Drohobych, Western Ukraine. Only Vekselberg&#x27;s father and his cousin survived the massacre. Vekselberg&#x27;s father had gone off to war, while his neighbors hid his cousin in a pit-house for almost four years. At the end of the war, she managed to flee to the territory that was controlled by the U.S. troops and later she moved to the U.S. Andrew Intrater is Vekselberg&#x27;s cousin.

In 1979, he graduated from the Moscow State University of Railway Engineering. After that, he worked as a researcher and headed the laboratory of the Design Bureau for rodless pumps &quot;Konnas&quot;.

== Activities ==
=== Russian Activities ===
In 1988, after the Gorbachev administration relaxed restrictions on private business as part of its new policy Perestroika and Glasnost, Vekselberg founded company Komvek, and in 1990, he co-founded Renova Group with college classmates, Leonard Blavatnik and Vladimir Balaeskoul (later, they both sold their stakes in Renova to Vekselberg). In the mid-1990s, Vekselberg and Blavatnik embarked on accumulating interests in aluminium smelters. The two partners recommissioned production at Irkutsk Aluminium Plant which had been previously suspended. In 1996, they co-founded Siberian-Urals Aluminium Company (SUAL) by merging of Ural and Irkutsk Aluminium Plants into Russia&#x27;s first aluminium holding company. (SUAL would later merge with Russian Aluminium of Oleg Deripaska and alumina assets of Glencore to create United Company RUSAL, the world&#x27;s largest aluminium company).  In 2002, SUAL constructed the first private railway in Russia to connect a bauxite mine in the Komi Republic with Ural Aluminium Plant through Trans-Siberian Railroad.

SUAL was the first major Russian company to pursue a consistent social policy in regions, offering support to local communities and small entrepreneurs. As from 2001, SUAL initiated several social and economic partnerships between its aluminium smelters and local municipalities in the regions of their presence. Moreover, SUAL set up a lifetime pension plan for World War II veterans who used to work at the plants that became part of SUAL.

In 1997, Alfa Group (owned by Mikhail Fridman, German Khan, and Alexei Kuzmichev) created with Vekselberg and Blavatnik a partnership for the acquisition of an interest in Tyumen Oil Company (TNK) that later became one of Russia&#x27;s largest oil and gas companies. In order to jointly hold oil assets, Alfa Group, Access Industries (a company owned by Blavatnik) and Vekselberg&#x27;s Renova established AAR consortium.

In 2003, AAR and British Petroleum (a British-American company then) merged their Russian oil assets in a 50-50 joint venture named TNK-BP, and that was the largest private transaction in Russian history. Acting as the chairman of the executive board of TNK, Vekselberg was instrumental in negotiating and closing the transaction. Vekselberg&#x27;s indirect participation in TNK-BP amounted to 12.5%.

In the 2000s, TNK-BP was the third oil &amp; gas company in Russia. Among other things, TNK-BP considered construction of a gas pipeline from the Kovykta gas condensate field through Mongolia to China and South Korea. Also, the original plan also envisaged the possibility to build up a large helium production facility on the basis of Sayanskkhimplast plant to export helium to Asia-Pacific markets. In the middle of 2012, BP started talks with the state oil company Rosneft with a view to selling BP&#x27;s 50% stake in TNK-BP. Rosneft finalised preliminary approval of a comprehensive deal in early 2013, offering to buy out TNK-BP in its entirety - AAR received cash consideration for its stake, BP received cash and Rosneft shares.

In 2006, Renova Group decided to diversify its business and divest form oil and gas sector to expand its footprint in manufacturing, hi-tech, and renewable energy. In 2007, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s assigned a &#x27;BB&#x27; long-term corporate credit rating to Renova Holding Ltd. and that spoke for the Group&#x27;s significant progress in portfolio diversification and liquidity improvement. After divesting from the oil &amp; gas sector, Vekselberg focused on the renewable energy, transport infrastructure, manufacturing, and IoT. Vekselberg became a pioneer in the Russian solar power sector. In 2017, Vekselberg inaugurated Platov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don, the first greenfield airport built in Russia after the collapse of the USSR. Platov airport was closed following Russian invasion against Ukraine. Eurocontrol predicts that the suspension of airports in the South of Russia will last until 2029. In 2019, Gagarin International Airport, the second greenfield airport, was put in operation in Saratov.

The Skolkovo Foundation was established in 2010 as a non-profit organization to encourage Russian innovation and openness of the Russian economy. The Board of the Skolkovo Foundation was led by two elected co-chairs, namely Viktor Vekselberg and ex-Chair of Intel Craig Barrett. As its president, Vekselberg signed a deal for Cisco Systems to invest $1 billion over ten years into Skolkovo Foundation projects. In 2018, Vekselberg stepped down as chairman of Skolkovo Foundation. Lucia Ziobro, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston office published in a column of trade journal that  the Skolkovo Foundation may being used by the Russian government to gain access to classified American technology. 

=== International activities ===
In 2004, Renova Group opened a branch in Zurich, Renova Management AG, as a part of the strategic plan to diversify its business towards hi-tech.

In July 2006, Renova Group acquired 10.25% in Unaxis Holding AG (later renamed as OC Oerlikon) from Victory Industriebeteiligung AG, an Austrian conglomerate.

In April 2007, Everest Beteiligungs GmbH, a joint venture of Renova Group and Victory, acquired approximately 18% in shares and additional 14% in physical delivery options in Sulzer.

Later, in 2007 – 2008, Victory sold out their stakes in both companies. In 2009, Renova Group raised its stake in Oerlikon to 44.7%.

This accumulation of stakes in the two flagships of the Swiss economy by the foreign conglomerate raised concerns with the Swiss authorities. Nevertheless, in 2010 the Federal Criminal Court confirmed that neither Vekselberg, nor Victory done any wrongdoing while building stakes in Oerlikon. Later, the Federal Department of Finance dropped the criminal proceedings initiated against the three investors in Sulzer in 2009.

The world financial crisis 2008 fully impacted Oerlikon company in November 2009 when it became apparent that the group would not have enough liquidity to repay loans. The company arranged a bank waiver to negotiate with all lenders and shareholders for a long-term solution and at AGM in April 2010 Renova Group agreed to inject capital in Oerlikon as part of the restructuring plan. Michael Süss, Oetlikon CEO, recently noted it has saved the company, this view is supported by the local expert community.

Because of a strong decline in European metal consumption and a significant decrease in metal prices in the local market Schmolz+Bickenbach (renamed in 2020 as Swiss Steel) meat the covenant breach in November 2012. Next year Renova Group had to be initiated a capital increase in the company for it can continue to develop in the long term and on a solid financial basis.

In March 2017, he was offered citizenship of the Republic of Cyprus due to his investments in the country; however, a spokesperson for Vekselberg reiterated that he only had Russian citizenship.

==Sanctions==
Vekselberg is one of many Russian &quot;oligarchs&quot; named in the Countering America&#x27;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017.

In March 2018, members from Robert Mueller&#x27;s team of special counsel investigators questioned Vekselberg at a New York area airport.

According to journalist Stephen Smith, Vekselberg is close to the Kremlin.

In April 2018, the United States Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on Vekselberg and Renova Group through designation under (&quot;Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine&quot;). United States imposed sanctions on him and 23 other Russian nationals in relation to Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea, officially freezing up to $2 billion in assets. Also he has been sanctioned by The U.S. Department of the Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) “for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy”.

In February 2021, Vekselberg complained that approximately $1.5 billion of his funds were frozen in American and Swiss bank accounts and that he was not allowed to send at least part of them to charity. Between 2018 and 2020 a US business PURE Insurance assisted Vekselberg with $315,891 of transactions in breach of sanctions and was accordingly fined $466,200 by OFAC in 2023.

On September 1, 2022, several properties believed to be linked to Vekselberg were searched by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security. The inspection included an apartment in Manhattan; an estate in the Hamptons, New York; and property on Fisher Island in Florida. Officials were seen carrying boxes out of the two New York locations.

In March 2022, following Russia&#x27;s invasion against Ukraine, the United States strengthened its sanctions and the UK, Poland and Australia also placed sanctions on Vekselberg, thereby seizing his assets and imposing a travel ban. During the Lady R incident Vekselberg was noted in the media as a possible source of Russian foreign influence over the South Africa&#x27;s governing party, the African National Congress (ANC), through his 49% ownership stake in United Manganese of Kalahari which is a joint venture with the ANC owned Chancellor House. United Manganese of Kalahari made a US$1.3 million donation to the party in 2022.

===Seizure of the Motoryacht &quot;Tango&quot;===

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, United States President Joe Biden signed , &quot;Prohibiting Certain Imports, Exports, and New Investment With Respect to Continued Russian Federation Aggression,&quot; an order of economic sanctions under the United States International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The order targeted two properties of Vekselberg worth an estimated $180 million: an Airbus A319-115 jet and the motoryacht &quot;Tango&quot;. Estimates of the value of the &quot;Tango&quot; range from $90 million (U.S. Department of Justice estimate) to $120 million (from the website Superyachtfan.com).

In April 2022, the yacht was seized by Civil Guard of Spain and U.S. federal agents in Mallorca. A United States Department of Justice press release states that the seizure of the &quot;Tango&quot; was by request of Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency task force operated through the United States Deputy Attorney General.

The matter is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The affidavit for the seizure warrant states that the yacht is seized on probable cause to suspect violations of (conspiracy to commit bank fraud), (International Emergency Economic Powers Act), and (money laundering), and as authorized by American statutes on civil and criminal asset forfeiture.

== Philanthropy ==

===Jewish philanthropy and remembrance of Holocaust===
Vekselberg is a Russian Jewish Congress Consul for Countering Antisemitism, a member of the Bureau of the Presidium of the Congress. Vekselberg has provided support to local Jewish communities throughout Russia and Ukraine in the course of the past decades. With his support, Synagogues and Jewish Community centers have been restored, built and renovated in Ekaterinburg, Irkutsk, Novosibirsk, Moscow, and Saratov.

Since the 1990s, Vekselberg has funded the maintaining of the Bronnitsky Wood Memorial near Drohobych to honor the memory of Jews murdered by Nazis during World War II.

He donated $4.5 million to the construction of the $50 million Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center in Moscow, and until February of 2021 he was the chairman of the museum&#x27;s board of trustees. Then Vekselberg was elected as honorary chairman of the board of trustees.

He finances the restoration and construction of synagogues in Russia, including the construction of the Choral Synagogue in Saratov.

In June 2018, a synagoge in Drogobych, Vekselberg’s native town in Western Ukraine, was restored from ruins and reopened its doors to public. Vekselberg financed the restoration works and managed to track down the Torah scroll which had been taken out from Drohobych during the Holocaust and later to be hidden in Israel in 1946. He donated this scroll to the synagogue in the loving memory of his father, Felix Solomonovich Vekselberg. 

In 2019, a monument was opened in Moscow to commemorate resistance heroes in concentration camps and ghettos. Vekselberg donated $300,000 to its creation.

In 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic broke out, Viktor Vekselberg donated over 2 billion rubles to buy medical equipment, personal protective equipment, and food for socially vulnerable groups of citizens.

In 2021, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov awarded Viktor Vekselberg, among other leaders of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, for helping to bring back Russian tourists from abroad.

=== Fabergé Museum ===
In February 2004, Vekselberg purchased nine Fabergé Imperial Easter eggs from the Forbes publishing family in New York City. The collection was transported to Russia and exhibited in the Kremlin and in Dubrovnik in 2007. Vekselberg is the single largest owner of Fabergé eggs in the world, owning fifteen of them (nine Imperial, two Kelch, and four other Fabergé eggs). In a 2013 BBC Four documentary, Vekselberg revealed that he had spent just over $100 million purchasing the nine Fabergé Imperial eggs from the Forbes collection. He claims never to have displayed them in his home, saying he bought them because they are important to Russian history and culture, and he believed them to be the best jewelry art in the world. In the same BBC documentary, Vekselberg revealed plans to open a museum to display the eggs in his collection. The result was the Fabergé Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia, which had its official opening ceremony on November 19, 2013.

In September 2006, Vekselberg agreed to pay approximately $1 million in expenses to transport the Lowell House Bells from Harvard University in the United States back to their original location in the Danilov Monastery and to purchase replacement bells.

Vekselberg paid £1.7 million at a Christie&#x27;s auction in 2005 for &quot;Odalisque&quot;, a nude said to be the work of Russian artist Boris Kustodiev. However, soon after the purchase, experts working for Vekselberg&#x27;s art fund, Aurora, began to cast doubt on the picture&#x27;s authenticity. They claimed that Kustodiev&#x27;s signature, dated 1919, was done in aluminium-based pigment not available until after the artist&#x27;s death in 1927. Vekselberg sued Christie&#x27;s, and the judge ruled in July 2012 that he was entitled to recover the £1.7 million that he paid for the painting, plus Christie&#x27;s was ordered to pay around £1 million in costs.

==Personal life==
He is married to Marina and has two children, a daughter and a son. His father is Jewish, and his mother Christian. He identifies himself as multi-national and does not attend weekly synagogue or church services. He has also identified as Jewish.

He has a daughter and grandson who live in New York.

Vekselberg reportedly lives in Switzerland.

<doc id="476003" wikidata="Q6716311" url="?curid=476003" title="MIT Mystery Hunt">
<text>The MIT Mystery Hunt is an annual puzzle hunt competition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is one of the oldest and most complex puzzle hunts in the world and attracts roughly 120 teams and 3,000 contestants (with about 2,000 on campus) annually in teams of 5 to 150 people. It has inspired similar competitions at Microsoft, Stanford University, Melbourne University, University of South Carolina, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and University of Aveiro (Portugal) as well as in the Seattle, San Francisco, Miami, Washington, D.C., Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio metropolitan areas. Because the puzzle solutions often require knowledge of esoteric and eclectic topics, the hunt is sometimes used to exemplify popular stereotypes of MIT students.

The hunt begins at noon on the Friday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, when the teams assemble to receive the first puzzles. It concludes with a puzzle-guided journey (a &quot;runaround&quot;) to find a &quot;coin&quot; hidden on MIT&#x27;s campus. Each puzzle hunt is created and organized by the winning team of the previous year, which can lead to substantial differences in the rules and structure. While early hunts involved a few dozen linear puzzles, recent hunts have increased in complexity, some involving as many as 250 distinct puzzles arranged in rounds, hidden rounds, and metapuzzles. Recent hunts have also revolved around themes introduced as a skit by organizers at the opening ceremony.

==Structure==

The objective of the hunt is to solve a set of puzzles in order to locate a coin hidden on the MIT campus. Participants can organize into teams of any size and are not required to be physically present. In recent years, team sizes have grown to around 200 solvers for the largest teams. The proportion of hunters who participate remotely has grown over time, as well.

The hunt and its puzzles are organized and created by the team that won the event the previous year, ensuring that no hunt will be won (or run) consecutively by the same people; each year&#x27;s writers are free to change any aspects of the internal structure of the Hunt. At noon on the Friday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day the teams gather at MIT, where organizers present a skit revealing the hunt&#x27;s theme and the initial round of puzzles, as well as announcing rules and other administrative matters. The teams can locate their headquarters anywhere and, over the course of the Hunt, check in with the organizers to verify the answers to individual puzzles. Some teams make extensive use of remote solvers—players who are located beyond the MIT campus. After the Hunt concludes, the organizers typically hold a wrap-up meeting at which the solutions to all the metapuzzles and the overall structure of the Hunt are revealed. Since 2009, hunts have been run for a fixed duration regardless of when the coin is first found, allowing more than one team to complete it (the record for most teams to complete a hunt is the 2017 Hunt: 17 teams completed it, the winners took only 18 hours).

While the puzzles in early hunts were either linear (after solving one puzzle, a new puzzle would be revealed) or released en masse, since 1998 the puzzles have been released in rounds. Successive rounds can be released at predetermined times, based upon completing a requisite number of puzzles in a previous round, or based on another metric entirely. The distinguishing feature of the present-day Mystery Hunt is employing the solutions to all the puzzles in a round to solve a metapuzzle, usually lacking any instructions. Once a team has solved all the metapuzzles, it may begin the &quot;runaround&quot; phase to find the hidden coin: the team follows a series of clues or puzzles that leads them from one location on the MIT campus to another until reaching the location where the coin is hidden. The entire hunt usually lasts approximately 48 hours, although the 2003, 2013, 2023, and 2024 hunts all required over 60 hours for the winning team, ending on Monday. Although the hidden prize is always called &quot;the coin&quot;, a variety of items have been used as the &quot;coin&quot;, including a compact disc, a fragment of a meteorite, a snowglobe, and a wooden cube.

The mystery hunt employs a wide range of puzzles including crosswords, cryptic crosswords, logic puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, anagrams, connect-the-dots, ciphers, riddles, paint by numbers, sudokus, and word searches. Solutions to these classic puzzles are further complicated by employing arcane or esoteric topics like quantum computing, stereoisomers, ancient Greek, Klingon, Bach cantatas, coinage of Africa, and Barbie dolls. Puzzles might also employ pictures, audio files, video games, physical objects, and/or locations within MIT or the Boston area. The hunt also assumes extensive familiarity with MIT&#x27;s campus, culture, and lore.

==History==
The Mystery Hunt was started in 1981 by then-graduate student Bradley Schaefer. The first Hunt consisted of 12 subclues on a single sheet of paper including a Vigenere cipher, a short runaround, and an integral. The answers to the subclues detailed the location of an Indian Head penny hidden on campus. The individuals who found the coin were allowed to take their pick of a $20 gift certificate to the school bookstore, a $50 donation to the charity of their choice, and a keg of beer. The hunt was organized for the next two years by Schaefer and after he graduated, the winners were given the honor of writing the hunt the next year.

Over the next several years, the hunt became longer and more involved as the number of participants increased. The earliest recorded theme is Captain Red Herring&#x27;s Mystery Island in 1992. The 1984 Hunt had 22 clues, and the 1987 Hunt had 19 clues and a final runaround. The Mystery Hunt has continued to grow, with the 2014 Hunt containing 115 puzzles, 10 metapuzzles, 5 events, a 24-puzzle mid-hunt runaround, and a 5-puzzle final runaround.

Though metapuzzles have existed in some form for many Mystery Hunts, the structure regarding how the puzzles combine into metapuzzles and how puzzles are released varies. For example, in the 2006 Hunt, &quot;antepuzzles&quot; provided access to new rounds, whose answers were derived from pieces of information attached to the round puzzles, but otherwise irrelevant to them (for example, the colors in which the puzzle titles were printed); in the 2009 Hunt, apart from the shorter introductory rounds, each main round had a unique structure and way of releasing new puzzles. In some Hunts, such as 1999&#x27;s and 2008&#x27;s, solvers are not told which sets of puzzles must be combined to create metapuzzles; figuring out the correct groupings is part of the puzzle.

While the hunt is hosted on MIT&#x27;s campus, puzzles are generally delivered through a website that tracks team progress on puzzles that updates when puzzles are solved. Puzzles may also involve physical components to be solved on campus. In 2021 and 2022, the Mystery Hunt was held entirely remotely, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="476004" wikidata="Q783992" url="?curid=476004" title="Burton Cummings">
<text>Burton Lorne Cummings (born December 31, 1947) is a Canadian musician and songwriter. He is best known for leading The Guess Who during that band&#x27;s most successful period from 1965 to 1975, and for a lengthy solo career.

Cummings has been inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and has been cited as one of the most influential performers in Canadian rock music. He has also been named as an officer of the Order of Canada and Order of Manitoba. The Burton Cummings Theatre and Burton Cummings Community Centre in Winnipeg are named in his honour.

== Career ==

=== Early years ===
Cummings was born and raised in Winnipeg by his mother and maternal grandparents, after his father left the family during his infancy. He attended St. John&#x27;s High School but dropped out at age 17 to pursue a career in music; the school granted him an honorary diploma in 2010.

In 1964 Cummings joined local R&amp;B band the Deverons (not to be confused with an American group called the Devrons) on piano and vocals. The Deverons released two singles locally in Winnipeg. In early 1966, shortly after his 18th birthday, Cummings joined another regionally successful band, Chad Allan &amp; The Expressions, to replace departed keyboardist Bob Ashley. Cummings also took on lead vocal duties in conjunction with group leader Chad Allan.

This group had been subjected to a record company publicity stunt in which their 1965 hit single &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot; was released anonymously with the message &quot;Guess Who?&quot; to trick listeners into thinking it was by a famous British Invasion band. Disc jockeys announced the single as being by someone called &quot;Guess Who?&quot;, forcing the group to accept the nickname; their latest releases had been issued under the name Chad Allan &amp; The Expressions with &quot;Guess Who?&quot; displayed prominently on the covers.

=== With The Guess Who ===

A few months after Cummings joined Chad Allan &amp; The Expressions, Allan left his namesake band, leaving Cummings as the sole singer. The band&#x27;s name was changed to simply The Guess Who, with Cummings becoming one of the band&#x27;s primary songwriters in conjunction with guitarist Randy Bachman. Their first album under this name was &quot;It&#x27;s Time&quot; in the summer of 1966.

The band became internationally successful upon the release of their album &quot;American Woman&quot; in 1970, which reached the top ten in several countries and made The Guess Who the first Canadian band to achieve a number one single in the United States. Bachman then left The Guess Who, and Cummings continued to lead the band through several more internationally successful albums. Cummings and drummer Garry Peterson were the only consistent members of the band during this era. Cummings disbanded The Guess Who in 1975 due to songwriting disagreements with guitarist Dominic Troiano.

=== Solo career ===
After leaving The Guess Who, Cummings embarked on a solo career; his self-titled debut solo album was released in 1976 and reached the top ten on the Canadian albums chart. The single &quot;Stand Tall&quot; was an international hit and sold more than one million copies in the United States. In 1977 he was presented with a Juno Award as best male vocalist. Also in 1977 he provided backing vocals for the Eric Carmen album &quot;Boats Against the Current,&quot; and released his second solo album &quot;My Own Way to Rock&quot;.

His 1978 album &quot;Dream of a Child&quot; sold more than 300,000 copies in Canada, making it one of the country&#x27;s highest-selling albums up to that point. Due to a dispute with his record label, his 1980 album &quot;Woman Love&quot; was not released in the United States but was another substantial hit in Canada that earned Cummings another Juno Award. The 1981 album &quot;Sweet Sweet&quot; was much less successful. Cummings also dabbled in acting during this period, with an appearance in the film &quot;Melanie&quot; in 1982. Cummings joined a short reunion tour of the classic Guess Who lineup in 1983, which resulted in the live album &quot;Together Again!&quot; (known as &quot;The Best of The Guess Who - Live!&quot; in the United States). The solo albums &quot;Heart&quot; (1984) and &quot;Plus Signs&quot; (1990) were moderately successful in Canada.

After an extended break from recording, Cummings released the live album &quot;Up Close and Alone&quot; in 1997, featuring songs from throughout his career performed on solo piano. Cummings then convened another reunion of The Guess Who for an extensive nostalgia tour from 2000 to 2003. In July 2003 the group performed before an estimated audience of 450,000 at the Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto SARS benefit concert. The show was the largest outdoor ticketed event in Canadian history.
In 2004, Cummings released the one-off single &quot;With God on Our Side&quot;, a Bob Dylan cover, which reached no. 29 on the Canadian singles chart. In 2006, Cummings and Randy Bachman started a new duo project backed by the Canadian rock band The Carpet Frogs, but were unable to use the name The Guess Who, which had been trademarked by bassist Jim Kale. The project became known as the Bachman-Cummings Band or simply Bachman-Cummings, and performs occasionally whenever both men are available. They released the covers album &quot;Jukebox&quot; in 2007 and most recently performed live in 2020. They have been selected to perform for a celebration of Manitoba&#x27;s 150th anniversary, to take place after delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Carpet Frogs have also served as Cummings&#x27;s solo band. In 2008, Cummings released his first all-new solo album in 18 years, &quot;Above the Ground.&quot; In 2017 he released a book of poetry titled &quot;The Writings of B. L. Cummings&quot;. He returned to solo performances in 2019, with shows featuring cover songs and original songs from throughout his career with The Guess Who and as a solo artist. His latest album, &quot;A Few Good Moments&quot;, was released on September 26, 2024.

== Awards ==

Throughout his career, Cummings has won five RPM Awards, six Juno Awards, 22 SOCAN Awards, three BMI America Awards, and a Genie Award.

In 2001, Cummings and the rest of The Guess Who received honorary doctorates from Manitoba&#x27;s Brandon University, which Cummings considered a singular honour as a high school dropout. That year Cummings also won three SOCAN Classic Awards.

On December 30, 2009, Cummings was named an officer of the Order of Canada by Governor General Michaëlle Jean, to mark a lifetime of outstanding achievement, dedication to community, and service to the nation. On June 28, 2011, Cummings was awarded with a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame; he had previously received a star as a member of The Guess Who in 2001. He was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 2016, and received a SOCAN lifetime achievement award in 2018.

== Personal life ==
Cummings married Cheryl DeLuca on September 22, 1981. They had no children. He lived in Sherman Oaks, California, for many years until moving to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, in 2017. He is part owner of the Winnipeg-based restaurant chain Salisbury House. In May 2018, Cummings was involved in a serious car crash in Los Angeles that required physical and mental therapy and the cancellation of several weeks of performances.

<doc id="476006" wikidata="Q7186772" url="?curid=476006" title="Phoenix (computer)">
<text>Phoenix (February 1973 – 30 September 1995) was an IBM mainframe computer at Cambridge University&#x27;s Computer Laboratory. &quot;Phoenix/MVS&quot; was also the name of the computer&#x27;s operating system, written in-house by Computer Laboratory members. Its DNS hostname was .

== Hardware ==
The Phoenix system was an IBM 370/165. It was made available for test purposes to 20 selected users, via consoles in the public console room, in February 1973. The following month, the Computing Service petitioned the Computer Board for an extra mebibyte of store, to double the amount of storage that the machine had. The petition was accepted and the extra store was delivered in September 1973.

== Communications ==
The IBM-supplied Telecommunications Access Method (TCAM) and communications controller were replaced in 1975 by a system, called Parrot, that was created locally by the staff of the Computer Laboratory, comprising their own software and a PDP-11 complex. Their goal in doing so was to provide a better user interface than was available with a standard IBM system, alongside greater flexibility, reliability, and efficiency. They wanted to support 300 terminals. The initial system, supplied in 1972, comprised the PDP-11 emulating an IBM 2703 transmission control unit, which TCAM communicated with just as though it were a 2703. The PDP-11 was used instead of a bank of 2703s because for a projected 300 terminals a bank of 2703s was not scalable, too expensive, and inadequate for the Computing Service&#x27;s needs, since it required paper tape readers and card punches as well. Even this solution proved to be unsatisfactory, and in 1975 TCAM was replaced by Parrot, with 200 terminals connected to the PDP-11, of which 80 could be simultaneously active. For full technical details of Parrot, see the technical report by Hazel and Stoneley.

== Software ==
The staff were motivated to write their own system software for the IBM installation as a result of their dissatisfaction with IBM&#x27;s own interactive command interpreter TSO. The initial product of their efforts was a Phoenix command interpreter which completely replaced the TSO command interpreter and was also available as a language for controlling batch job submissions through the use of a single IBM JCL command to invoke the Phoenix command interpreter. The Phoenix command interpreter was based on that of the Titan Multiple Access System which had inline input files and was in service from 1967.

Steve Bourne, who wrote the Bourne Shell for Unix, was at Cambridge in the 1960s and early 1970s. It seems likely that some of the Bourne Shell&#x27;s constructs in Unix also derived from the Titan command interpreter.

GEC&#x27;s OS4000 JCL was based on the Phoenix command interpreter.

== Upgrades ==
By 1973 Phoenix had a thousand megabytes of disk space. In 1982 it was upgraded to an IBM 3081D, and in 1989 to an IBM 3084Q.

== Decommissioning ==
The system was decommissioned 24 years after its installation, on 30 September 1995 at 09:17 (by its own clock).

== Help command ==
Phoenix/MVS is remembered for the responses that it gave to its codice_1 command. One such was the response to the command codice_2, to which Phoenix/MVS would reply &quot;Deities must be invoked directly and not via Phoenix MVS.&quot;

== Games ==
One recreational activity on Phoenix was the playing of interactive fiction games. Because the games were large and demanded significant machine resources whilst running, they were generally played outside of prime time, when research palled. (The exit message of one game, &quot;Fyleet&quot; written by Jonathan Partington in 1985, was &quot;Well go and do some work then&quot;.) Other games were &quot;Advent&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Colossal Cave&quot;), &quot;Zork&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Dungeon&quot;), and &quot;Acheton&quot;.

&quot;Acheton&quot; was created by two Cambridge graduate students, Jon Thackray and David Seal, in 1978–1979, and expanded over the ensuring two years with the aid of Jonathan Partington. It was written with the aid of a game assembler, which, unlike the contemporary ZIL game assembler from Infocom, was freely available for use by all users of Phoenix between 1980 and 1995.

Several large early British games developed on Phoenix were sold commercially for microcomputers by Acornsoft and, later, Topologika. This was comparable to Infocom&#x27;s contemporaneous commercialisation of the MIT mainframe game Zork. Many of these games were subsequently translated by Graham Nelson to run on the Z-Machine.

The commercial release of &quot;Brand X&quot; was &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Quest&quot;.

== Bulletin board ==

Phoenix also hosted a lively bulletin board named GROGGS, which fostered the community spirit amongst the machine&#x27;s users. After Phoenix was decommissioned, GROGGS migrated to a Unix system, and survived until August 2020. A second, more structured bulletin board, ZINQUE, was popularly held to stand for &#x27;Zinque Is Not Quite Unix Either&#x27;.

== Wake ==

Phoenix inspired great affection in its users, to such an extent that a wake was held on 1 September 1995 to mourn its passing. A University newsgroup called &quot;ucam.phx.nostalgia&quot; was also created for reminiscences.

== Current location ==

The IBM 3084 was taken out by Prof. Jim Austin after it was shut down. It is now on display at the Computer Sheds computer museum in East Yorkshire, UK.

<doc id="476008" wikidata="Q1272835" url="?curid=476008" title="The Statement (film)">
<text>The Statement is a 2003 drama thriller film directed and produced by Norman Jewison, from a screenplay by Ronald Harwood, based on the 1996 novel by Brian Moore. It stars Michael Caine, Tilda Swinton, Jeremy Northam, Alan Bates, William Hutt, John Neville and Charlotte Rampling.

The film is inspired by the true story of Paul Touvier, a Vichy French police official who was indicted after World War II for ordering the execution of seven Jews in retaliation for the French Resistance&#x27;s assassination of Vichy France minister Philippe Henriot. For decades after the war, he escaped trial thanks to an intricate web of protection, which allegedly included senior members of the Roman Catholic priesthood. He was arrested in 1989 inside a Traditionalist Catholic priory in Nice and was convicted in 1994. He died in prison in 1996, at the age of 81.

An international co-production of Canada, the United Kingdom, and France, &quot;The Statement&quot; was released in Canada on December 12, 2004. It received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics, though it won Best Overall Sound and Best Sound Editing at the 24th Genie Awards. &quot;The Statement&quot; is the last film by Jewison before his retirement and death in 2024. It was also Bates&#x27;s final theatrical role prior to his death in the year of the film’s release.

==Plot==
Pierre Brossard, a French Nazi collaborator, orders seven Jews executed during World War II. Some 40 years later, he is pursued by David Manenbaum, a hitman who is under orders to kill Brossard and leave a printed statement on his body proclaiming the assassination was vengeance for the Jews executed in 1944. Brossard kills Manenbaum, hiding the dead body after finding the statement and discovering that his pursuer was travelling on a Canadian passport. Brossard for years has taken refuge in sanctuaries in southern France within the Traditionalist Catholic community, appealing to long-time allies who have operated in great secrecy to shield him and provide him with funds. But now they bring increased scrutiny to themselves for continuing to do so.

The murder of Manenbaum attracts the interest of local police and eventually the persistent Investigating Judge Annemarie Livi. She becomes absorbed by the case, not discouraged by the lack of assistance she encounters from official sectors. Livi forms an alliance with the similarly dedicated Colonel Roux, a senior French Gendarmerie investigator, and the pair initially suspect that Manenbaum was part of a Jewish assassination plot. They discover that Brossard has been the subject of several previous investigations, dating back more than 40 years, which have all failed. Livi and Roux discover hidden resources, tightening the noose around Brossard, who finds his allies increasingly reluctant to help him.

Brossard in desperation pays a surprise visit to his estranged wife Nicole, a maid who is living in lower-middle-class circumstances in Marseille and is very apprehensive about seeing him again. Brossard&#x27;s allies, including certain priests and a wartime colleague who has risen into a position of great power within the French government, are feeling the heat from the relentless questioning of Livi and Roux. Now desperate and unsure whom to trust, Brossard seeks new identity papers and money so he can escape France forever. On the night he is to escape, however, his handler Pochon shoots him dead on orders from his former protectors within the government, who fear he will cause trouble for them if captured.

Following Brossard&#x27;s death, Livi and Roux trace the conspiracy to protect him to a high-ranking government official, and arrest him for treason.

==Cast==
==Historical basis==
&quot;The Statement&quot; is based on the best-selling 1995 novel of the same name by Brian Moore. In the novel and film, the fictional Brossard is based on Paul Touvier, a member of the Milice, a paramilitary police force of the Vichy French regime during World War II who ordered the execution of seven Jews in 1944. After the war, he was convicted of treason and sentenced to death in absentia, but with the aid of right-wing Roman Catholic clergymen, who provided him refuge in safe houses and monasteries, Touvier avoided capture. He received a controversial pardon from the President of France, Georges Pompidou, in 1971, but remained on the run. Unlike Brossard, Touvier was finally arrested in 1989, on a new charge of crimes against humanity; tried, convicted, and sentenced to life in prison, he died in jail in 1996, aged 81.

==Reception==
The film holds an approval rating of 24% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;The movie bores despite a splendid performance by Michael Caine.&quot; The film grossed a little over $765,000 domestically and $1.55 million worldwide in its limited release against a budget of $27 million.
