<text>Maurice O&#x27;Connor Drury (3 July 1907 – 25 December 1976) was an Irish psychiatrist, best known for his accounts of his conversations, and close friendship, with the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. 

==Early life and education==
&#x27;Con&#x27; Drury (as he would be known to his friends) was born in Marlborough, Wiltshire, England of Irish parents. He grew up in Exeter, Devon, England, where his father, Henry D&#x27;Olier Drury, who had been a teacher in Marlborough College, retired.

Drury was educated at Exeter Grammar School. He then studied philosophy at Trinity College, Cambridge. His tutors included G. E. Moore, C. D. Broad and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Drury became Wittgenstein&#x27;s friend for many years to come, until the latter&#x27;s death in 1951.

After graduation Drury entered the Cambridge theological college Westcott House, leaving after one year. He then enrolled in the medical school in Trinity College Dublin, graduating in 1939.

==Medical career==
Drury joined the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving in Egypt and taking part in the Normandy landings. After his demobilisation, Drury worked as a House Physician in a hospital in Taunton. In 1947 he was appointed Resident Psychiatrist at St Patrick&#x27;s Hospital Dublin. From 1951 he also worked in a subsidiary nursing home, St Edmundbury, Lucan, Dublin. He lectured medical students on psychology in Trinity College and the Royal College of Surgeons. He is described as relating to his student audience as &quot;quite an intellectual man, who was very much speaking and relating to an audience as an intellectual.&quot; He was promoted to Senior Consultant Psychiatrist in 1969. In 1970 due to anginal pain he moved to a private residence in Dublin.

==Personal life==
He married the matron of St Patrick&#x27;s Hospital, Eileen Herbert, in 1951. One of his children, Luke Drury, a physicist, was elected president of the Royal Irish Academy in 2011. His second son, Paul, was one of Ireland&#x27;s most prominent newspaper editors, editing &quot;The Star&quot;, &quot;Evening Herald&quot;, &quot;Irish Daily Mai&quot;l, and &quot;Ireland on Sunday&quot;. He was also deputy editor of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;. He died in 2015.

Drury was a member of the Zoological Society of Ireland.

==Writings==
Drury was the author of one book, &quot;The Danger of Words&quot; (1973). This was included in a collection of many of his writings edited by John Hayes and published in 2017. His papers are on deposit in the library of Mary Immaculate College Limerick. Ray Monk described the book as perhaps &quot;the most truly Wittgensteinian work published by any of Wittgenstein&#x27;s students.

==Philosophy==
Drury&#x27;s book, &quot;The Danger of Words&quot; has been described by Ray Monk as &quot;in its attitudes and concerns, more truly Wittgensteinian&quot; than almost any other book published by one of Wittgenstein&#x27;s students. 

Drury brought Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;critique of language&quot; to bear on the practice of medicine, and particularly psychology that promised the same control over the mind that physics achieved with matter. This promise, pointed out Drury, was one where the delivery date was always being pushed into the future.

<text>Pui O Beach is a gazetted beach running along almost the entire shoreline of Pui O in Lantau Island, Hong Kong, facing Pui O Wan and neighbouring Chi Ma Wan Peninsula. The beach has barbecue pits and is managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong Government. The beach is 260 metres long and is rated as good to fair by the Environmental Protection Department for its water quality in the past twenty years. The water flow of Pui O Beach comes from the sea and nearby rivers, so Pui O Beach is the junction of fresh water.

==Usage==
Due to the geological composition of surrounding area, the sand on the beach is mixture of black and yellow. The Hong Kong Government has constructed facilities on the upper beach for wild camping. As the beach faces south-southwest, the sunset can be clearly watched in Pui O. There are many restaurants beside the beaches, most of which sell swimming supplies and food.

==Features==
The beach has the following features:
* BBQ pits (six)
* Changing rooms
* Showers
* Toilets
* Fast food kiosk

===Pui O Campsite===
There is a campsite at Pui O Beach that is open to the public and free of charge. It is open 24 hours for camping and is managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. Users can register with the management office before using it. There are a total of 52 camping spots in the camping site, each of which is divided by wooden fences, and the ground is mainly sand. The camp is equipped with facilities like camp bays, barbecue pits and an office. The camp is currently temporarily closed until further notice due to COVID-19 pandemic.

==Incident==
On 23 November 2018, Billy, a widely known eight-year-old bull who lived at the beach, died with his stomach full of plastic bags. An examination showed that the animal’s stomach and intestinal tract had been blocked with enough plastic bags to fill two rubbish bins.

<doc id="486042" wikidata="Q713461" url="?curid=486042" title="A-Mei">
<text>Kulilay Amit, Han Chinese name Chang Hui-mei (), better known by her stage name A-Mei (, born 9 August 1972), is a Taiwanese singer and record producer of Puyuma descent. Born as Amit Kulilay in eastern Taiwan, she made her debut in 1996. A leading figure of the Mandopop music scene since the mid-1990s, A-Mei is widely known for breaking ground for Taiwanese indigenous peoples and being a voice for LGBT rights and gender equality. She has been given the moniker &quot;Queen of Mandopop&quot; and the &quot;Pride of Taiwan.&quot; Her career longevity, resilience, artistry, and versatility have established her as a pop culture icon in the Sinophone world.

Born and raised in Beinan, Taitung, Taiwan, A-Mei moved to Taipei at age 20 in 1992. In 1996, she released her debut studio album, &quot;Sisters&quot;, which saw major commercial success and sold over a million copies in Taiwan. Her sophomore record, &quot;Bad Boy&quot; (1997), found even greater success, eventually becoming the country&#x27;s best-selling album overall. Her follow up releases—&quot;Holding Hands&quot; (1998), &quot;Can I Hug You, Lover?&quot; (1999) and &quot;Regardless&quot; (2000)—received critical and commercial acclaim, with the first two albums also selling well over a million copies. A cross-straits controversy caused her to experience a decline in sales in 2004; she would later experience a resurgence in 2006 with her album &quot;I Want Happiness?&quot;.

Her albums &quot;Truth&quot; (2001), &quot;Amit&quot; (2009), and &quot;Faces of Paranoia&quot; (2014) each won her a Golden Melody Award for Best Mandarin Female Singer, making her one of the singers who won the category the most times. Having sold over 50 million records, A-Mei is the best-selling female artist in Taiwanese music history. She is recognized as having the influence and cultural impact in the Sinophone world, equivalent to artists such as Madonna in Western music and popular culture. In 2017, she was included in the &quot;Charity Heroes List&quot; by the Asian edition of &quot;Forbes&quot;, and her influence is even greater than that of many famous Taiwanese political and business figures.

==Life and career==
===1972–1995: Early years and musical beginnings===
A-Mei was born on 9 August 1972 in the Tamalakaw tribe (belonging to the Puyuma) in Beinan, Taitung, Taiwan. Her Puyuma-language name is Kulilay Amit, alternatively transliterated Gulilai Amit. She was the seventh child in a family of nine children. During her childhood A-Mei&#x27;s family was impoverished, making it increasingly difficult to raise so many offspring. To support the family, the father originally wanted to give A-Mei and her younger sister Saya Chang to relatives for adoption. It was A-Mei&#x27;s mother who took them to hide deep in the mountains to escape the fate of being adopted. Despite avoiding the fate of being separated from her family, A-Mei&#x27;s upbringing was still quite difficult due to always being short on money. Although A-Mei couldn&#x27;t receive formal training in music and stage performances, she showed her love for stage singing performances since she was a child. Like most Native Taiwanese people, she was exposed to tribal music very early on. Her mother used to record herself singing, then play it back on tape for her daughters to hear. A-Mei had always been fascinated by music, saying that she was addicted to the radio and would rush to watch the late night music programs that introduced her to English songs when she was a child. Oftentimes she summoned the children in the village and persuaded everyone to use flashlights to create &quot;stage lighting effects&quot; for her. In addition to her talent in music, A-Mei was also very good at sports. In elementary school, under the careful guidance of coach Shi Shunxiong, she earned a second-degree black belt and once represented her school in a taekwondo competition.

In 1992 A-Mei left her hometown of Taitung for the first time to work in a restaurant and sell clothes at a roadside stand in Taipei. She first connected to the entertainment business by joining the televised &quot;Five Lights Singing Contest&quot; on TTV Main Channel in 1992 after encouragement from her father. She made it all the way through to the finals but lost in the final round.
She was disappointed and was almost ready to give up interest in music competitions. A-Mei&#x27;s father then told her, &quot;You definitely can sing, and you perform songs beautifully. Why don&#x27;t you enter the competition again to show that you have a talent for music?&quot; So, encouraged by the kind words from her father, she attended the singing contest again in 1993. Her performances enchanted the judges and she was crowned champion the following year. Unfortunately her father didn&#x27;t live to see her victory due to him succumbing to his illness, leaving A-Mei devastated. Years later in 2009 when she released an album for the first time under her real name Amit, she sung the song &quot;Disappear (掉了)&quot; which expresses how dearly she misses him. After winning the Taiwan TV Five Lights Awards program, he was invited by Japan Asia Airways to go to Japan to perform at the &quot;World Music Tour&quot; in Tokyo.

After her father&#x27;s death, A-Mei struggled to recall her passion for music until 1995 when she began to sing in local pubs with a rock band called &quot;Relax&quot; which was formed by her musician cousin. Her pub performance impressed Taiwanese music producer Chang Yu-sheng and Chang Hsiao-yen, the head of Taiwanese record label Forward Music at the time; she signed a recording deal with Forward Music in March 1996.

===1996–1997: Career beginnings, &quot;Sisters&quot;, and &quot;Bad Boy&quot;===
After she signed a recording deal with Forward Music she made an appearance on Chang Yu-sheng&#x27;s album, &quot;Red Passion&quot;, which was released on 12 July 1996, where they sang a duet titled &quot;The One Who Loved Me Most, Hurt Me The Most (最愛的人傷我最深).&quot; In November 1996, when A-Mei was invited to sing &quot;I&#x27;m a Dreamer on Air (空中的夢想家),&quot; the theme song for Taiwan&#x27;s UFO Radio station, she again drew attention from the public. On 13 December 1996, A-Mei released her debut album &quot;Sisters&quot;, which she made under the tutelage of Chang. Originally, the head honchos at Forward Music worried that A-Mei&#x27;s aboriginal heritage would have a negative impact on the album&#x27;s sales due to discrimination against aboriginal people still being widespread at the time. In spite of this, A-Mei still emphasized to the media that she was from an aboriginal background and was the very first Taiwanese mainstream pop star to proudly flaunt her aboriginal identity. On the contrary, the album &quot;Sisters&quot; became a runaway success. The album topped the Taiwan IFPI chart for nine consecutive weeks and sold a total of 1.21 million copies in Taiwan and four million in Asia. The sales result for &quot;Sisters&quot; surprised Forward Music, since they had no expectations of it being so well-received, who even forgot to sign her up for the 8th Golden Melody Awards (the Sinophone equivalent to the Grammy Awards). 
The songs on &quot;Sisters&quot; such as &quot;You Don&#x27;t Want Anything (原來你什麼都不要),&quot; &quot;Released (解脫),&quot; &quot;Cut Love (剪愛)&quot; and the titular track enjoyed hefty radio airplay throughout the Sinophone world. On the album&#x27;s titular track, Chang invited A-Mei&#x27;s mother, sisters and other relatives to participate in the chorus singing and added Puyuma musical elements to make the song more culturally enriching. The outstanding sales of &quot;Sisters&quot; helped it become the fourth best-selling album in Taiwan overall. It won the top ten albums of the Chinese Musicians Exchange Association in 1997, and eventually was placed at No. 10 in the selection of the &quot;200 Best Taiwanese Popular Music Albums.&quot;

On 17 May 1997, &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; declared A-Mei Asia&#x27;s most popular singer. On 7 June 1997, she released her second studio album titled &quot;Bad Boy&quot;. For this record Chang was still highly involved in the songwriting and production department. &quot;Bad Boy&quot; became A-Mei&#x27;s second consecutive album to top the Taiwan IFPI chart for nine weeks, and sold 1.38 million copies, making it the most sold album in Taiwanese music history. Additionally it sold an excess of six million copies throughout Asia, making A-Mei one of the most powerful and sought-after celebrities in the continent. The album &quot;Bad Boy&quot; spawned numerous hit singles such as the title track, &quot;Can&#x27;t Cry (哭不出來),&quot; &quot;Whenever I Think About You (一想到你呀),&quot; &quot;Dancing Alone (一個人跳舞)&quot; and &quot;Listen to the Sea (聽海).&quot; They all have now been regarded as modern-day classics and are still receiving heavy rotation and being sung by contestants on televised major music competitions to this day. A-Mei performed songs from the album on her A-Mei Live In Concert 1998 concert tour the following year. &quot;Bad Boy&quot; earned her two Golden Melody Award nominations for Album of the Year and Best Mandarin Female Singer. However, tragedy struck five months after the album&#x27;s release; her manager Chang died on 12 November 1997, at age 31, after falling into a coma for 24 days due to a car crash that occurred on 20 October 1997. During Chang&#x27;s stay in the hospital, A-Mei visited him many times. At that time, to pay tribute to Chang who was dying, she released the CD single &quot;Listen to You, Listen to Me (聽你聽我).&quot; On 29 December 1997, she released the innovative album &quot;You Make Me Free Make Me Fly!&quot;, which featured the songs that were to be performed on her upcoming tour. The album was another hit, shipping 800,000 units in Taiwan and four million throughout Asia.

=== 1998–1999: &quot;Holding Hands&quot;, &quot;Can I Hug You, Lover?&quot; and &quot;A-Mei New Century Collection&quot; ===
A-Mei embarked on her first solo concert tour which was in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, in January 1998. On 10 January 1998, A-Mei held her first large-scale ticketed concert titled A-Mei Live in Concert 1998, breaking the record for the shortest time a large-scale concert has been held by a Taiwanese singer since their debut (there was only a year and 28 days between the release date of the first album and the date of the concert). It also became the fastest-selling concert in Taiwan in the past decade and had a very fanatic audience, with both the Taipei and Kaohsiung shows being full houses. The two shows at the Singapore Indoor Stadium also set a number of records, including the record for the fastest sold-out concert: the first show was sold out within ten hours while the second was sold out within eight hours.

Due to her immense fame, A-Mei was formally invited by the Japanese public broadcaster NHK to perform as a representative of Taiwan in the annual ceremony &quot;Asia Live Dream&quot; in February 1998. 12 October 1998, saw the release of her fourth studio album, &quot;Holding Hands&quot;. In the album, A-Mei sang the posthumous works &quot;Are You Ready&quot; and &quot;Her Consciousness (後知後覺)&quot; of her mentor Chang Yu-sheng and for the first time collaborated with Taiwanese singer-songwriter David Tao, who had just risen in the music scene. He wrote and composed the songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Lie To Me (不要騙我)&quot; and &quot;High High High.&quot; Continuing her winning streak of success, the album earned a RIT record certification by selling over 790,000 copies in the span of one month. Cumulative sales reached 1.1 million copies in Taiwan and four million in Asia. &quot;Holding Hands&quot; earned her a Golden Melody Award nomination for Best Mandarin Female Singer. Also in 1998, she won the Best Theme Song award at the Star Awards 1998 ceremony for her performance of the song &quot;I Do Not Mind (我無所謂),&quot; which served as the opening theme song to the TV series &quot;Rising Expectations&quot;. On December 31, a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert titled &quot;Sisters Acting, Singing and Partying Through 1999&quot; was held at Nangang in Taipei.

In January 1999, A-Mei endorsed Sprite in Sinophone territories, singing the song &quot;Give Me Feelings (給我感覺)&quot; in the commercials. The commercial was filmed in Shanghai, which resulted in serious traffic jams around the shooting site. At this point she had won more than 30 awards in just two and a half years since her debut, and her total album sales exceeded ten million. In the past two years, she had been awarded consecutively. In the preceding year alone MTV selected her record as the best Mandarin album. A-Mei won the &quot;Gold Award for Female Singer in the Music World&quot; in the 1998 Ultimate Song Chart Awards Ceremony held by Commercial Radio Hong Kong and the &quot;Asia Pacific Music Award&quot; in the 1998 Top Ten Golden Songs Awards Ceremony. Winning &quot;District&#x27;s Most Popular Hong Kong Female Singer,&quot; she had become the only non-Hong Kong native and non-Hong Kong debut singer to win those two awards. On 20 April 1999, her EP entitled &quot;Feel&quot; was released and sold 180,000 copies, making it the best-selling mini-album in Taiwan&#x27;s music history. On 8 June 1999, A-Mei released her fifth album &quot;Can I Hug You, Lover?&quot;. Carrying the momentum of the upcoming Mei Li 99 concert, the album sold more than 500,000 copies within its first week of availability in Taiwan, and was No. 1 on the IFPI chart for an eleven consecutive weeks, breaking the nine week championship record of her very own album &quot;Bad Boy&quot;. It sold a total of 1.18 million copies in Taiwan, and finally more than eight million copies in Asia, breaking the Asian sales record of six million copies of the highest-selling album in Taiwan, &quot;Bad Boy&quot;, to become A-Mei&#x27;s highest-selling album in Asia to date. The album also earned her a Golden Melody Award nomination for Best Mandarin Female Singer.

In the following months A-Mei held her second Asia concert Tour, Mei Li 99, visiting various cities in Taiwan and other Asian cities, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing and Shanghai. She became the first Taiwanese singer to perform at the Shanghai Stadium, with the seats at the venue filled to the brim; it is notable that there were nearly 80,000 attendees attending the show, making it the most successful concert in that city&#x27;s history. On 6 August 1999, she became the first artist to perform a concert at Beijing&#x27;s Workers&#x27; Stadium. With more than 60,000 tickets sold, she broke the record for the highest number of spectators for a single performance in the city. More than 50,000 people poured into the two concerts at Hong Kong&#x27;s now defunct Kai Tak Airport, making her the first and last Taiwanese singer to hold two ticketed concerts there. At the Taipei Municipal Stadium, she became the only female singer to &quot;open the entire venue&quot; to a crowd of nearly 50,000 people, thus being regarded as a major benchmark in Taiwan&#x27;s concert history. A-Mei is also the first to perform in Taitung County by holding a large-scale ticketed concert at the Taitung County Stadium that attracted tens of thousands of people. In Singapore, she also became the first act to perform at the Singapore National Stadium; all the 35,000 tickets at that concert sold out completely. The tour held 14-concerts and attracted about 500,000 spectators, all told.

At this point in time Eastern and even Wester papers had dubbed her popularity the &quot;A-Mei syndrome.&quot; In the same year, A-Mei became the first Taiwanese artist to appear on the cover of Asia Weekly. Many people at the time even believed that she had the ability to inherit Teresa Teng&#x27;s popularity in mainland China. In September 1999, she sang &quot;Love, Never Disappears (愛, 永遠不會消失),&quot; a song composed by Wang Leehom, to honor the victims of the 921 earthquake (also known as Chi-Chi earthquake) and donated her concert revenue from that night in Singapore to charity. In December 1999, she performed with Jacky Cheung at the 36th Golden Horse Awards. A-Mei&#x27;s so-called &quot;sister power&quot; became unstoppable at that point, and she was listed among the &quot;Top Ten Chinese Voice Figures&quot; in 1999 by Huasheng Magazine. On 28 December 1999, A-Mei released the greatest hits album &quot;A-Mei New Century Collection&quot;. It also became a hot seller, shipping 410,000 copies in Taiwan and 3 million copies in Asia. It is Taiwan&#x27;s best-selling album by a female artist in the 21st century. On 31 December 1999, she participated in two New Year&#x27;s Eve concerts in Taipei City.

=== 2000: China Ban and &quot;Regardless&quot;===
Initially, the year 2000 began without a hitch. In January 2000, A-Mei performed Sprite&#x27;s new Chinese commercial song, &quot;I Want to Fly (我要飛).&quot; During that same month, the latest issue of the now defunct American magazine &quot;Details&quot; produced the Millennium &quot;International Ecstasy List.&quot; Taiwan&#x27;s Shu Qi and A-Mei were both on the list, with &quot;Details&quot; going as far as calling her China&#x27;s Madonna. On February 4, 2000, she was invited to CCTV Spring Festival Gala 2000, where she sung the song &quot;Give Me Feelings (给我感觉),&quot; which is a treatment that many famous singers have never had the chance to enjoy. After the Spring Festival Gala A-Mei&#x27;s popularity continued to skyrocket in mainland China. On 28 February 2000, she became the first Taiwanese artist to be interviewed by the American cable television network CNN. CNN called A-Mei the &quot;Asian Music Ambassador&quot; and praised her for taking the mainland by storm with her singing at a time when cross-strait relations were tense and everchanging. In March 2000, she held two shows in Hong Kong with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra; singing a wide variety of songs that included Chinese, English, Cantonese and Taiwanese Hokkien classics at the Hong Kong Coliseum. A month later on 14 April 2000, she released the audio of the performances on a live album titled &quot;Time to Say Goodbye, A-Mei Hong Kong Live&quot;.

On 20 May 2000 she sang the National Anthem of the Republic of China at the presidential inauguration ceremony of Chen Shui-bian, angering the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China which subsequently interfered her with visiting mainland China until July 2001. Under pressure from Beijing, Sprite also buckled and cut its contract with A-Mei by removing her as its endorser, meanwhile contemporary hit radio stations in China temporarily ceased broadcasting her music. On 5 December 2000, she released her seventh studio album titled &quot;Regardless&quot;, which turned out to ultimately be A-Mei&#x27;s last original studio record to be released under Forward Music. The album was another hit for her by selling over 360,000 copies in Taiwan and over a million copies across Asia. &quot;Regardless&quot; is listed as one of the best-selling albums in Taiwan in the 21st century. The album earned her a Golden Melody Award nomination for Best Mandarin Female Singer at the 12th Golden Melody Awards. To promote the album she held a concert at Nangang District, Taipei on the day of its premiere. A-Mei also held press conferences in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia. On 31 December 2000, she participated in a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in Taipei.

===2001–2003: Switch to Warner Music, &quot;Truth&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot; and &quot;Brave&quot;===
A-Mei graced the cover of Newsweek in January 2001, with the headline &quot;Pop &amp; Politics.&quot; This made her the only Taiwanese singer to pose on the magazine&#x27;s cover to date. After finding a home in June 2001 with Warner Music Taiwan, A-Mei sang the Mandarin theme song for the movie &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, which was a cover of Faith Hill&#x27;s &quot;There You&#x27;ll Be.&quot; In August, Beijing hosted the 2001 Summer Universiade; when she was invited to be a guest at the opening ceremony and sang the two songs &quot;Sisters (姊妹)&quot; and &quot;Holding Hands (牵手)&quot; at the finale, the entire venue of 80,000 people screamed and cheered. On 7 September 2001, Forward Music released the compilation album, &quot;Journey&quot;, which included all unreleased songs A-Mei recorded when she was signed under Forward Music. The album sold over 100,000 copies in Taiwan and a million copies across Asia. 29 October 2001, saw the release of her first album under Warner, which was simply titled &quot;Truth&quot;. Commercially, the album was a success, selling over 200,000 copies in Taiwan and 1.6 million copies across Asia. Hit songs like the title track, &quot;Remember (記得)&quot; and &quot;Hate That I Love You (我恨我愛你)&quot; became popular songs in major televised singing talent shows years down the line. On 9 November 2001, in Taipei City, the &quot;Real New Song Concert&quot; was held at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall where A-Mei held a free large-scale concert to promote the album. More than 30,000 fans were packed at the venue, allowing fans who had not seen each other for a long time to share her musical works over the past year. In December 2001, A-Mei held seven concerts in the United States and Canada. The Toronto show is also the most successful solo concert held by a Taiwanese singer there in recent years. At the last performance of the tour in Silicon Valley, San Francisco, a small autograph session for a hundred fans was held. During the event the local mayor of Cupertino presented the &quot;Outstanding Artist Award from Cross-Strait and Three Places.&quot; On 31 December 2001, she participated in a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in Taipei City.

In 2002 A-Mei won the Best Mandarin Female Singer award for the very first time with the album &quot;Truth&quot; at the 13th Golden Melody Awards; it was a deserving win after four years of consecutive nominations in the same category since her second album &quot;Bad Boy&quot;. Also a performing guest, she put on a showcase titled, &quot;Best of Asia&quot; that evening. A-Mei was named as one of the 25 Asian Heroes featured in the special issue of Time Magazine in 2002. On 30 August 2002, she released her tenth studio album &quot;Fever&quot;. The first batch of 120,000 copies was sold out within five days of its release, and the demand for goods continued to soar past the 150,000 mark. The album sold 180,000 copies in Taiwan and over two million copies throughout Asia, making it yet another success. &quot;Fever&quot; earned her two Golden Melody Award nominations for Album of the Year and Best Mandarin Female Singer. On 3 August 2002, she embarked on her third concert tour, A-Class Entertainment World Tour, which visited Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and United States. In the same year, she won the MTV Asia Award for Favorite Artist Taiwan. A-Mei appeared on the cover of Asia Weekly for the second time at the end of the year. The magazine titled &quot;A-Mei Sings the Future of Cross-Strait, Singing Through the Political Wall of the Taiwan Strait,&quot; using her singing to penetrate the ideologies of both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and sung out new hope for the future of the Taiwan Strait. In Star News&#x27; poll of young Taiwanese people&#x27;s favorite female idols, according to the newspaper&#x27;s questionnaire survey results, A-Mei won the title of teenagers&#x27; favorite female idol with 5.8%. Beating out other popular figures like Stefanie Sun, Coco Lee and Elva Hsiao.

Due to the SARS epidemic in 2003 A-Mei enthusiastically participated in the charity record co-sponsored by Wang Leehom, David Tao and Azio TV. The song was titled &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; and featured other prolific musicians like Jay Chou, Elva Hsiao, Jolin Tsai, S.H.E and Jody Chiang. In June 2003, A-Mei sponsored the Korean PC game &quot;A3,&quot; being paid tens of millions for the endorsement. On the 27th of the same month, the album &quot;Brave&quot; was released. She also had her first starring role in a film serving as the heroine of the movie &quot;Brave&quot;, and sang the theme song &quot;Brave&quot; for the movie of the same name. The song &quot;Brave&quot; became the champion song in the gay love song vote that year. &quot;Brave&quot; is the only A-Mei album to date to not receive a nomination for a Golden Melody, but it still achieved great sales of 170,000 copies in Taiwan and 1.6 million in Asia. The commercial success of &quot;Brave&quot; convinced the record company to spend tens of millions holding three &quot;It&#x27;s Me Who&#x27;s Missing You&quot; summer concerts in Taitung&#x27;s Seaside Park, Sizihwan and Fulong Beach. In the second half of 2003 the A-Class Entertainment World Tour was held in Malaysia, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Connecticut, Las Vegas and other places. In November 2003, she participated in the &quot;City of Joy – Chang Yu-Sheng, All Star Tribute Concert&quot; to commemorate her mentor the late Chang Yu-sheng.

===2004–2005: &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot;, decline in sales and popularity, and studying abroad at Boston===
At the MTV Asia Awards 2004 A-Mei won the award for Favorite Artist Taiwan for the second time on Valentine&#x27;s Day 2004. At the end of April 2004, A-Mei won a World Peace Music Award in recognition of her emphasis on indigenous culture and her extraordinary influence in the Sinophone world, making her the first Taiwanese singer to win this award. On 12 June 2004, A-Mei became the focus of international controversy when she was forced to abruptly cancel a concert in Hangzhou after students from Zhejiang University branded her a &quot;supporter of Taiwanese independence.&quot; Several hundred students invaded a press conference at which she had been scheduled to appear, chanting slogans and holding banners decrying the &quot;green performer.&quot; Concerned for A-Mei&#x27;s safety, the organizers canceled her appearance. Back home in Taiwan, A-Mei was under fire from individuals who championed Taiwanese pride. China&#x27;s state-run CCTV had quoted her as saying, apparently about her decision to sing her national anthem at President Chen&#x27;s inauguration in Taiwan: &quot;I had to suffer the consequences of a decision that was not made by me ... I should have been more discreet in my behavior, which impacts so many people.&quot; The former Vice President Annette Lu even questioned the patriotism of the popster. Meanwhile, Premier Yu Shyi-kun offered a clarification of his own previous remarks about the singer. He explained that his remarks were intended to criticize China, and that he had not intended to criticize the singer herself, arguing that the local media had misquoted him. While politics and showbiz are not exactly bedfellows in Asia, A-Mei clarified that she has no intention of engaging in anything irrelevant to her profession. In response to the uproar, A-Mei called on the media to cease its sensational reporting and to end their distortion of her words. She reinforced her position by stating, &quot;What we really need is more peace and love in our country.&quot; Political issues aside, A-Mei gave a benefit concert in Taipei on 22 July 2004, for the victims of Typhoon Mindulle, which caused widespread destruction that summer, especially in the aboriginal areas in the country. The concert was free, but each audience member was asked to make a donation of US$30. On 31 July 2004, A-Mei set foot in Beijing once again and held a successful concert, with an estimated 10,000-strong audience. As reported by the media, A-Mei confessed that she had never felt such great pressure at a concert before, when fans begged her not to be disturbed by the raucous protesters.

Undeterred by negativity, A-Mei proceeded to work on her new album &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot;, which was released on 21 September 2004. A-Mei composed the two songs &quot;Love Is The Only Way (愛是唯一)&quot; and &quot;Crucial Moment (關鍵時刻)&quot; on the album. The album earned her a Golden Melody Award nomination for Best Mandarin Female Singer at the 16th Golden Melody Awards. The music video of the song, &quot;Love Is The Only Way&quot; was nominated for Best Music Video of the Year. In October, it was featured in American LGBT magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot;. While &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot; performed well at first, it quickly fell off the charts due to its sound, which was different from the standard Mandarin pop sound at that time. A-Mei also stirred up controversy with the song &quot;Love Is The Only Way,&quot; which had a music video that depicted a same-sex wedding with the two grooms sharing a kiss. The video ended up being banned from broadcasting in the mainland. As a whole the album sold about 80,000 units in Taiwan, which is considerably lower than her previous releases. &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot; became A-Mei&#x27;s lowest-selling studio album to that point and was generally viewed as an abject commercial failure. The many personal and professional setbacks over the past year made A-Mei contemplate on whether her current situation was suitable for continuing her music career; so at the end of 2004 she came up with the idea of temporarily leaving the music scene to go study abroad in Boston, Massachusetts. In the same year, A-Mei became the only Chinese singer to be featured on the cover of the UK&#x27;s NME, with her album &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot; trumping Oasis&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot;, Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;X&amp;Y&quot;, and the rest of the powerhouses to be crowned the &#x27;Best British Album of the New Century&#x27;, and to be featured on the cover.

In January 2005 she went to Hong Kong to participate in a charity show that was meant to raise funds for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. In February 2005, she headed to Boston for a three-month language study through Boston University&#x27;s Center for English Language &amp; Orientation Programs. The trip to Boston was intended as a journey of self-discovery rather than a mere getaway. After returning to Taiwan she first participated in Ni Min-jan&#x27;s public memorial and sang to comfort his family. Meanwhile, a series produced by the Discovery Channel in collaboration with Taiwan&#x27;s Government Information Office called &quot;Portraits Taiwan (台灣人物誌)&quot; that spotlighted Taiwanese icons in different fields, selected A-Mei as the representative of the &quot;Mass Culture and Entertainment&quot; category. A-Mei took up the task as the Taiwanese World Vision International ambassador and headed to southern Sudan with the charitable organization in June/July 2005. On 2 September 2005, she went to Shanghai to participate in Jackie Chan&#x27;s racing fundraiser. On 1 October 2005, A-Mei participated in a national women&#x27;s charity endorsement, which also made her the first singer to sing at the Taipei Arena. In November of the same year, A-Mei performed &quot;Singing Sister Shadow&quot; at the 42nd Golden Horse Awards. Her live singing skills and stage charm were unanimously praised by the public, and the performance was regarded as her first big step to return to the pinnacle of the music scene after a brief slump.

===2006–2007: Resurgence of sales, revived popularity, &quot;I Want Happiness?&quot; and &quot;Star&quot;===
On 17 February 2006 she released her thirteenth studio album, &quot;I Want Happiness?&quot;. Producer Eric Chen used A-Mei&#x27;s most pure and direct singing as the main theme. On the first day of release nearly 100,000 copies of the album were pre-ordered. Popular singles from the album such as the title track and &quot;Hostage (人質)&quot; became popular songs in KTV and major televised singing competitions. Widely considered as her comeback album, &quot;I Want Happiness?&quot; was a commercial success by selling 160,000 copies in Taiwan, and the record is credited for saving her career from its imminent doom. In the mainland Chinese market, it even won the first half of the year with total sales of 960,000 copies. The album sales champion eventually sold over two million copies in Asia and earned her a Golden Melody Award nomination for Best Female Mandarin Singer. On 27 May 2006, a ticketed concert was held in Las Vegas, with all of the 7,000 tickets sold out entirely. The organizers also specially arranged for A-Mei to take a helicopter to the press conference venue to enjoy diva-level treatment. In June 2006, A-Mei participated in the finale performance titled &quot;Music ORZ&quot; at the 17th Golden Melody Awards. In December 2006, she produced a musical, &quot;In Love with Carmen&quot;, which was performed twice at Taipei Arena. During the performances she invited the Singaporean singer A-do and the Taiwanese singer A-Lin (who had just debuted at the time) to join her on stage.

In April 2007, EMI Taiwan spent more than ten million to hold a pan-Asian press conference in Hong Kong that was meant to announce the signing of A-Mei to their company. During the event she signed a three-year and three album recording contract worth NT$150 million, making her the highest-paid female singer in the region at the time. On 3 August 2007, she released her fourteenth studio album, &quot;Star&quot;. The critically and commercially acclaimed effort earned her three Golden Melody Award nominations for Best Mandarin Album, Best Female Mandarin Singer, and Song of the Year for &quot;A Moment (一眼瞬間),&quot; which was a duet with Taiwanese singer Jam Hsiao. &quot;Star&quot; occupied the No. 1 spot on Taiwan&#x27;s G-Music charts for four consecutive weeks and ended up selling over 130,000 copies in Taiwan and 1.7 million copies in Asia. To celebrate the sales of &quot;Star&quot; a concert was held at Tamsui Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf on 9 September 2007. 30,000 attended that night, setting a record for the largest number of people attending a concert held by a singer at that venue. On 22 September 2007, she participated in the fourth Asia Song Festival in Seoul, South Korea, with her three-song performance receiving many praises. In the same month A-Mei became the very first Taiwanese singer to be interviewed by the news agency Reuters. In October 2007, she served as the &quot;Rainbow Ambassador&quot; for the fifth annual Taiwan Pride parade. She said that she was very happy for the support her gay fans have given her along the way and will always support gays who are in hiding along with the ones who are happy to come forward. She also generously embraced HIV carriers Yahui and Ladybug on stage and expressed her hope to participate in the Pride Parade every year. In November 2007, she embarked on her fourth solo concert tour called the Star World Tour which visited Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Canada and United States.

===2008–2010: &quot;Turandot&quot; and &quot;Amit&quot;===

In February 2008, A-Mei filmed the music video for the 2008 Olympics theme song &quot;Forever Friends&quot; in the Forbidden City. From March to May 2008, she embarked on an opera tour of the musical &quot;Turandot&quot; in Japan, which was produced by Joe Hisaishi and directed by Amon Miyamoto. A-Mei overcame the language barrier and performed in Tokyo with many Japanese actors. She performed 59 consecutive performances overall in major Japanese cities such as Osaka and Nagoya, with all of the performances being very well received. On 12 May 2008, the 2008 Sichuan earthquake occurred. She donated the NT$5 million revenue from 11 performances of &quot;Turandot&quot; between the 12th to the 22nd to the earthquake victims so that they could rebuild their homes. At the 19th Golden Melody Awards that year, not only was she nominated for five awards and invited to perform for her &quot;Star&quot; album, A-Mei brought her &quot;Amit&quot; performance style to the big stage for the first time with pop punk music.

At the end of March 2009, the Star World Tour ended at the Taipei Arena. The tour lasted a year and five months and held 20 performances in 13 cities, attracting an audience of 500,000 spectators. A-Mei became the first Chinese singer to perform five consecutive concerts with the same theme at the Taipei Arena. She released her fifteenth studio album, &quot;Amit&quot;, on 26 June 2009, which was her very first album to be released under her aboriginal birth name. This album showed a significant change in the genre of music A-Mei sung, as most of the songs incorporated hard rock music. The songs in the album extensively touch on serious topics such as personality conflicts, lost family ties, human sexuality, female consciousness, homosexuality, among others. The commercially successful album sold over 120,000 copies in Taiwan and topped the G-Music charts for three nonconsecutive weeks, while sales across Asia exceeded 1.3 million. On 5 September 2009, she became the spokesperson for the 2009 Summer Deaflympics held in Taipei and participated in the opening ceremony as a guest, singing the theme song &quot;Dreams You Can Hear (聽得見的夢想).&quot; In November 2009, she embarked on her fifth concert tour, Amit First Tour, which visited Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia. In March 2010, she was paid nearly ten million yuan to become the spokesperson of Coca-Cola in Taiwan. At the 21st Golden Melody Awards, A-Mei became the most decorated artist that night with the album &quot;Amit&quot; winning a total of six trophies. The last time A-Mei had received a major Golden Melody Award was when she won the Golden Melody Award for Best Female Mandarin Singer in 2002 for her album &quot;Truth&quot; eight years prior.

===2011–2013: &quot;R U Watching Me?&quot; and &quot;AMeiZING World Tour&quot;===

In January 2011, The Biography Channel (now known as FYI), which mainly reports on the world&#x27;s most influential and representative figures, produced a special episode about A-Mei, which was broadcast in 23 countries around the world with more than 67 million viewers. The exclusive interview focuses on A-Mei&#x27;s story from when she went to study in the United States in 2005 when her career had circled the drain, to when she later produced a musical and became a sensation in the music industry as Amit. She is the first Taiwanese singer to accept this interview. In March 2011, she renewed her contract with Coca-Cola Company to become the spokesperson for their 125th anniversary; A-Mei was also allowed to personally design a limited edition commemorative bottle. On 23 April 2011, the album &quot;R U Watching Me?&quot;, which took three years to produce, was released. &quot;R U Watching Me?&quot; sold more than 65,000 copies in Taiwan, becoming the fifth highest-selling album in Taiwan that year. The album earned her a Golden Melody Award nomination for Best Mandarin Female Singer. In May 2011, CNN sat down and interviewed A-Mei for the second time. During the interview she talked about her singing career, image transformation, etc. in the &quot;Asian Celebrity Chat Room&quot; &quot;TalkAsia&quot;. In June 2011, A-Mei ranked first in a Forbes survey of &quot;The 25 Most Famous Taiwanese in Mainland China,&quot; making her influence bigger than that of many well-known political and business figures. At the 22nd Golden Melody Awards ceremony, A-Mei sang the song medley &quot;My Dearest Music Master.&quot; In the same month the revised album &quot;R U Watching Me Our Celebration Edition&quot; was released, and the &quot;COCA COLA Happy 125 Years A-Mei Live&quot; concert was held at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall on the 25th with 30,000 fans in attendance, marking a rare event at that venue in recent years.

In September 2011 she embarked on her sixth concert tour called the AMeiZING World Tour to commemorate the 15th anniversary of her debut; the tour kicked off in Chengdu, China at the Chengdu Sports Centre and went on to play 59 shows in total in Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, United Kingdom and United States. During the tour&#x27;s London stop on, she became the first Chinese-speaking female singer to hold a large-scale solo concert at The O2 Arena in England, setting a precedent for Taiwanese popstars in the European music market. In July 2013, A-Mei became one of the judges of Chinese talent show, &quot;The Voice of China (season 2)&quot;, along with Wang Feng, Na Ying, and Harlem Yu. In December of the same year, A-Mei held a free outdoor concert to support the legalization of same-sex marriage at Huashan 1914 Creative Park. The concert had no sponsorships, so the production cost of more than three million was paid all by herself.

=== 2014–2019: EMI / Universal Music, &quot;Faces of Paranoia&quot;, &quot;Amit 2&quot; and &quot;Story Thief&quot; ===
In January 2014 A-Mei was placed on the Asia Gay Equality Heroes list made by the well-known international gay magazine &quot;Element Magazine&quot; in Singapore. After Universal Music Group acquired EMI, it became one of Universal&#x27;s record labels. In June 2014, A-Mei signed a recording deal with EMI Taiwan and was selected as the chief brand officer for the record label. The brand director of China also announced that Show Lo and Rainie Yang have joined the company. On 2 July 2014, she released her fourteenth studio album, &quot;Faces of Paranoia&quot;. The album earned Golden Melody Award shortlistings for Best Mandarin Female Singer and Song of the Year with the album&#x27;s titular song; she ended up taking home the prize for Best Mandarin Female Singer. At the tail end of summer 2014, a concert was held at the Fulfillment Amphitheater in Taichung, with all of the 6,000 tickets selling out instantly.

<text>Makar(a) Sankrānti (), () also referred to as Uttarāyana, Makara, or simply Sankrānti, is a Hindu observance and a mid-winter harvest festival in India and Nepal. It is typically celebrated on 14 January annually (15 January on a leap year), this occasion marks the transition of the sun from the zodiac of Sagittarius (&quot;dhanu&quot;) to Capricorn (&quot;makara&quot;). As this transition coincides with the sun&#x27;s movement from south to north, the festival is dedicated to the solar deity, Surya, and is observed to mark a new beginning. Across India, the occasion is celebrated with numerous multi-day festivals. 

The festivities associated with Makar Sankranti are known by various names including &quot;Sankranthi or Peddha Panduga&quot; in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, &quot;Khichari&quot; in Bhojpuri region, &quot;Magh Bihu&quot; in Assam, &quot;Maghi Saaji&quot; in Himachal Pradesh, &quot;Makaravilakku&quot; in Kerala, Makara sankranti in Karnataka, &quot;Maghi Sangrand&quot; in Punjab, &quot;Pongal&quot; in Tamil Nadu, &quot;Maghi Sangrand&quot; or &quot;Uttarain&quot; (Uttarayana) in Jammu, &quot;Sakrat&quot; in Haryana, Sakraat in Rajasthan, &quot;Sukarat&quot; in central India, &quot;Uttarayana&quot; in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, &quot;Ghughuti&quot; in Uttarakhand, &quot;Dahi Chura&quot; in Bihar, &quot;Makar Sankranti&quot; in Odisha, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Goa, West Bengal (also called &quot;Poush Sankranti or Mokor Sonkranti&quot;), Uttar Pradesh (also called &quot;Khichidi Sankranti&quot;), Uttarakhand (also called &quot;Uttarayani&quot;) or as simply, &quot;Maghe Sankranti&quot; (Nepal), &quot;Songkran&quot; (Thailand), &quot;Thingyan&quot; (Myanmar), &quot;Mohan Songkran&quot; (Cambodia), Til Sakraat in Mithila, and &quot;Shishur Senkrath&quot; (Kashmir). On Makar Sankranti, Surya (Hindu solar deity) is worshipped along with Vishnu and goddess Lakshmi throughout India.

Makar Sankranti is observed with social festivities such as colourful decorations, rural children going house to house, singing and asking for treats in some areas, &quot;melas&quot; (fairs), dances, kite flying, bonfires and feasts. The &quot;Magha Mela&quot; is mentioned in the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Many observers go to sacred rivers or lakes and bathe in a ceremony of thanks to the Sun. Every twelve years, the Hindus observe &quot;Makar Sankranti&quot; with Kumbha Mela – one of the world&#x27;s largest mass pilgrimage, with an estimated 60 to 100 million people attending the event. At this event, they say a prayer to the Sun and bathe at the Prayagaraj confluence of the River Ganga and River Yamuna, a tradition attributed to Adi Shankaracharya. Makar Sankranti is a time of celebration and thanks giving, and is marked by a variety of rituals and tradition.

== Date variations ==

Makar Sankranti is set by the solar cycle and corresponds to the exact time astronomical event of the Sun entering Capricorn and is observed on a day that usually falls on 14 January of the Gregorian calendar, but on 15 January in leap years. Makar Sankranti&#x27;s date and time is analogous to Sidereal time of Zodiac sign of Capricorn (when sun enters).

The year is 365.24 days long and the time difference between the two consecutive instances of Makar Sankranti is almost the same as the year. There are 365 days in a year. Thus, every four years the calendar is offset by one day which is adjusted by adding leap day (29 February). Hence, Makar Sankranti falls on 15 January every leap year. Sidereal time of sign of Capricorn also shifts by a day due to leap year. Similarly, the time of equinoxes also shifts by a day in each four year window. For example, the equinox of September does not fall on the same date each year nor does the winter solstice. Any event related to one revolution of the Earth around the Sun will have this date shift within a four year cycle. Similar changes can be seen in the exact time of solstices and equinoxes. See the table, how the time of the equinox and a solstice increases and decreases in a cycle of four years.

The time difference between two consecutive winter solstices is about 5 hours 49 minutes 59 seconds, with respect to winter solstice time, and the time difference between two consecutive Mankar Sankranti is about 6 hours and 10 minutes. Towards the end of the 21st century, there will be more occurrences of Makar Sankranti on 15 January in a four-year cycle.
And Makar Sankranti will be on 16 January for the first in the year 2102 as 2100 will not be a leap year.

=== Makar Sankranti and Uttar Ayana ===

Makar Sankranti is celebrated when the Sun&#x27;s ecliptic longitude becomes 270° measured from a fixed starting point which is in opposition to Spica, i.e. this is a sidereal measure. Uttarayana begins when the Sun&#x27;s ecliptic longitude becomes 270° measured from the Vernal equinox, i.e. this is a tropical measure. While both concern a measure of 270° their starting points are different. Hence, Makar Sankranti and Uttarayana occur on different days. On the Gregorian calendar, Makar Sankranti occurs on 14 or 15 January; Uttarayana starts on 21 December.

Due to the precession of the equinoxes the tropical zodiac (i.e. all the equinoxes and solstices) shifts by about 1° in 72 years. As a result, the December solstice (Uttarayana) is continuously but very slowly moving away from Makar Sankranti. Conversely, the December solstice (Uttarayana) and Makar Sankranti must have coincided at some time in the distant past. Such a coincidence last happened 1700 years back, in 291 CE.

== Significance ==
Every year &quot;Makar Sankranti&quot; is celebrated in the month of January. This festival is dedicated to the Hindu religious sun god &quot;Surya&quot;. This significance of Surya is traceable to the Vedic texts, particularly the Gayatri Mantra, a sacred hymn of Hinduism found in its scripture named the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. Makara Sankranti is also associated with the birth and coming of the final Avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu, Kalki.

Makara Sankranti is regarded as important for spiritual practices and accordingly, people take a holy dip in rivers, especially Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri. The bathing is believed to result in merit or absolution of past sins. They also pray to the Sun and give thanks for their successes and prosperity. A shared cultural practices found amongst Hindus of various parts of India is making sticky, bound sweets particularly from sesame (&quot;til&quot;) and a sugar base such as jaggery (&quot;gud, gur, gul&quot;). This type of sweet is a symbolism for being together in peace and joyfulness, despite the uniqueness and differences between individuals. For most parts of India, this period is a part of early stages of the Rabi crop and agricultural cycle, where crops have been sown and the hard work in the fields is mostly over. The time thus signifies a period of socializing and families enjoying each other&#x27;s company, taking care of the cattle, and celebrating around bonfires, in Gujarat the festival is celebrated by flying kites.

Makara Sankranti is an important pan-Indian solar festival, known by different names though observed on the same date, sometimes for multiple dates around the Makar Sankranti. It is known as &quot;Pedda Panduga&#x27;/&#x27;Makara Sankranti&quot; in Andhra Pradesh, &quot;Makara Sankranti&quot; in Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharashtra, &quot;Pongal&quot; in Tamil Nadu, &quot;Magh Bihu&quot; in Assam, &quot;Magha Mela&quot; in parts of central and north India, as &quot;Makar Sankranti&quot; in the west, &quot;Makara Sankranti&quot; or &quot;Shankaranti&quot; in Kerala, and by other names.

Day 2-Sankranti 

Sankranti

In Maharashtra, on Makar Sankranti day, people exchange til-gul (sweetmeats made from sesame seeds and jaggery).

Married women invite friends/family members and celebrate &quot;Haldi-Kunku&quot;. Guests are given til-gul and some small gift, as a part of the ritual. On this day, Hindu women and men make it a point to wear black clothes. As Sakranti falls in the winter months of the region, wearing black adds to the body warmth. This is an essential reason behind wearing black, which is otherwise barred on festival days. As per another legend, Lord Surya forgave his son Shani and his son visited him on Sankranti. That is the essential reason why people distribute sweets and urge them to let go of any negative or angry feelings. Also, newly married women offer five sunghat or small clay pots with black beaded threads tied around them, to the Shakti deity. These pots are filled with newly harvested food grains and are offered with betel leaves and areca nut. Its observance takes place on a rather subdued note, unlike major festivals of the region like Ganesh Chaturthi.

It is astronomically important for devotees who worship the sun god at the great Konark temple with fervour and enthusiasm as the sun starts its annual swing northwards. According to various Indian calendars, the Sun&#x27;s movement changes and the days from this day onwards become lengthier and warmer and so the Sun-God is worshiped on this day as a great benefactor. Many individuals at the start of the day perform a ritual bath while fasting. Makara Mela (Fun fair) is observed at Dhabaleswar in Cuttack, Hatakeshwar at Atri in Khordha, Makara Muni temple in Balasore and near deities in each district of Odisha.

===Kerala===
In Kerala, this is called as Sankranti or Makara Sankranti. In Malabar villages, this used to be celebrated as the victory over a demon. In Sabarimala, on this day, the Makaravilakku is lit to show the significanceofthelord- god.

===Tripura===
The Tripuri is the promoter of Hangrai festivals. They have first introduced this festival of immersing of ancestors&#x27; remains in the holy river. Since then it was adopted by other groups in India and popularized over the years.

Mythology inform us that when the world was just created by Lord Siva or Sibrai there was only the grassland and nothing was present. The god then created an egg to produce a human being. The egg hatched to give birth to a human being, creating a big bang. He crawled out of eggshells and looked around for anyone like him, but he found none. There was total silence, peace tranquility, and harmony on the earth. He was frightened by seeing this scenario of earth. He remained near the eggshell most of the time and went back near to the empty eggshell, went inside of half of the shell and covered it with another one, and hid there.

The almighty God was upset by this development. Years later he created another egg, and after ten months it hatched. There was a big bang when it hatched that shook the earth and gave birth to another human. He was very courageous and powerful, as soon as he came out of the human eggshell, he started shouting and announced to the whole of the world, &#x27;I am the first to be born in this earth, I am the eldest on the earth, no one is elder to me in this earth. He named himself Subrai and declared to the whole of the earth that he is the ruler of this earth and king of this universe. Hearing the big bang Hangrai got more frightened, closed his eyes, and silently remained inside the shell. But when he heard the voice like his own, he came out of his shell and met Subrai. At this Subrai told that he is older than Hangrai, since then Subrai became the elder brother of Hangrai, and people knew them as it is.

Thousand of years later when they grew older, the time had come to leave this world. As Hangrai grew older than Subrai, one day he felt sick very seriously, Hangrai was on his death bed, Subrai was taking care of him. Then god came before them and said, &#x27;Among both of you, Hangrai is elder than Subrai, I only know this, because I have created both of you. Hangrai will leave this earth very soon. Subrai will do all necessary rituals to cremate the body of Hangrai.&#x27; And god disappeared from there.

Then Subrai cried like a baby, touching the feet of Hangrai, saying, &#x27;Elder brother, I have treated you like a younger brother for thousands of years, forgive me for my wrongdoing unto you.&#x27;

Hangrai said, &#x27;I have done so!&#x27; and touched his head as gesture of forgiving and blessing unto him, and then breadth for his last.

After the death of Hangrai, his younger brother Subrai cremated his body and did all the rituals, and immerged Hangrai&#x27;s remaining in the holy water of the river on the last day of Pousa month. Since then, people observed these rituals and festivals every year and continued to this day. That is why the day is named &quot;Hangrai&quot;, which has later adopted by other ethnic groups of people of India.

Every year on the day of Hangrai the Tripuri people observe it in grand pomp and show. In every house of Tripuri preparation for Hangrai starts two-three days before. Houses are cleaned, washed whitewashed. All the utensils, clothes, articles are cleaned, homes are decorated. Different types of Tripura cakes, dishes, and drinks are prepared, near and dear ones, relatives are invited for a feast.

===Uttar Pradesh===

Over two million people gather at their respective sacred places for this holy bathing such as Prayagraj and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and Haridwar in Uttarakhand. The day at a domestic household begins by taking ritual bath before sunrise, doing ritualistic prayers to the rising Sun. It also includes pledging for and donating Food, clothing and money to Brahmin/s called Purohita. It is followed by generous gifting of Food, Clothing, jewelleries and money to female relatives like to married Daughters, Sisters and Daughter-in-Laws and their families.

===Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, and among Tamil diasporas worldwide===
On this day, the Tamil farmers and the Tamil People honour and perform a pooja to the Sun God Suriya Narayanan. This happens when the sun enters the zodiac sign of Capricorn (Makara). The Thai Pongal festival is celebrated in mid-January, or the Tamil month of Thai, to coincide with the rice harvest.

Pongal practices and rituals in Sri Lanka and diasporic countries aren&#x27;t much differentiated from those followed in Southern India, outside notably the Jalikkattu practice, which is not existent among Sri Lankan Tamils and diasporic Tamil communities. 

In Sri Lanka, celebrations of Pongal extend generally to two days and not four, and instead of the Pongal dish, a similar food called Pukkai is offered. Its preparation happen on the first day and not on the second as in India (where Pongal start one day earlier with Boghi day). Hence here, Pongal celebration is focused on the day of Thai Pongal only.

<text>The Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens (HKZBG) is one of the oldest zoological and botanical centres in the world, and the oldest park in Hong Kong. Founded in 1864, its first stage was opened to the public in 1871. It occupies an area of in Central, on the northern slope of Victoria Peak.

Similar to Hong Kong Park, Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens provides a natural environment and atmosphere. While physically smaller than Hong Kong Park it contains more plants, animals and facilities.

==History==


The park was previously named &quot;Bing Tau Fa Yuen&quot; (). &quot;Bing Tau&quot; literally means &#x27;the head of the soldiers&#x27; or the &#x27;commander-in-chief&#x27;. According to the Hong Kong government&#x27;s Leisure and Cultural Services Department, it was nicknamed as such by the city&#x27;s Cantonese community, as it was the former site of the city&#x27;s Government House. Alternatively, &quot;Bing Tau&quot; may be the phonetic transliteration of the first two syllables of the word &quot;botanical&quot;. In the old days, many lovers liked to go there on a date. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, it was renamed as .

The founder of The Garden Company Limited discussed at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens and came up with the idea of starting a company; therefore, it was named after &quot;Garden&quot; and its Cantonese transliteration &quot;Garden&quot;. The park was closed from 1931 to 1933 to allow for the construction of a reservoir under the park.

==Memorials==

Located at the southern entrance to the gardens, at Upper Albert Road, sits the Chinese War Memorial, which is dedicated to the Chinese who died assisting the Allies during World War I and World War II. The inscription on the lintel reads: &quot;In Memory of the Chinese who died loyal to the Allied cause in the Wars of 1914–1918 and 1939–1945&quot;. A granite arch in the shape of a &quot;paifang&quot; was erected in 1928. Reference to the Second World War was added later.

A bronze statue of King George VI was erected in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of British colonial rule over Hong Kong (1841–1941).

==Plants==
There are more than 1,000 species of plants in the gardens, mostly indigenous to tropical and sub-tropical regions. It includes some rare species like the dawn redwood and the local Ailanthus. Besides these, some species which can produce flowers throughout the year can also be found there, like the Hong Kong orchid tree.

Different Species are grown in the Thematic gardens in the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens.

===Bamboo Garden===
This garden grows about ten times bigger than other gardens.

===Camellia Garden===
More than 30 species are grown in this garden. Crapnell&#x27;s camellia (&quot;Camellia crapnelliana&quot;), Grantham&#x27;s camellia (&quot;Camellia granthamiana&quot;) and Hong Kong camellia (&quot;Camellia hongkongensis&quot;) are native to Hong Kong.

Some introduced rare species such as Yunnan camellia (&quot;Camellia reticulata&quot;) and golden camellia (&quot;Camellia nitidissima&quot; and &quot;Camellia euphlebia&quot;) can also be found in this garden.

===Magnolia Garden===

This garden grows 5 species of magnolia:
* Chinese magnolia (&quot;Magnolia coco&quot;)
* Yulan (&quot;Magnolia denudata&quot;)
* Purple magnolia (&quot;Magnolia liliiflora&quot;)
* Saucer magnolia (&quot;Magnolia × soulangeana&quot;)
* Southern magnolia (&quot;Magnolia grandiflora&quot;).

===Greenhouse===

Various species of orchids, ferns, bromeliads, vines and carnivorous plants are grown in the greenhouse.

===Palm Garden===

This garden grows over 30 species under 22 genera of the palm family.

===Bauhinia Garden===

This garden grows 8 species including Hong Kong orchid tree (&quot;Bauhinia blakeana&quot;), purple camel&#x27;s foot (&quot;Bauhinia purpurea&quot;) and camel&#x27;s foot tree (&quot;Bauhinia variegata&quot;).

=== Azalea Garden ===

This garden grows over 10 azalea species including red azalea (&quot;Rhododendron simsii&quot;), lovely azalea (&quot;Rhododendron pulchrum&quot;), purple azalea (&quot;Rhododendron pulchrum&quot; var. &quot;phoeniceum&quot;) and white azalea (&quot;Rhododendron mucronatum&quot;), those are native to Hong Kong. There are also rare species such as yellow azalea (&quot;Rhododendron molle&quot;) and Westland&#x27;s rhododendron (&quot;Rhododendron moulmainense&quot;).

=== Herb Garden ===
Various species of herb are grown in the garden.

==Animals==

The size of the garden precludes the keeping of very large mammal species such as giraffes. Nevertheless, the collection of primates is varied, including creatures such as the Hoffmann&#x27;s two-toed sloth, Red necked wallaby, golden lion tamarin, gibbon, orangutan, ring-tailed lemur and black-and-white ruffed lemur. Apart from the plants, there are over 400 birds, 50 mammals and 20 reptiles.

===Mammals and reptiles===

A taxidermy specimen of Siu Fa, the female jaguar that lived in Hong Kong for nearly 20 years is on display at the Education and Exhibition Centre of HKZBG from 5 March 2009.

A pigeon pair of Bornean orangutan twins were born in the HKZBG in July 2011, joining the big family of the gardens. This is the first-ever successful breeding of Bornean orangutan twins in the HKZBG, bringing to five the total number of this primate in the gardens

To enhance public understanding and appreciation of all living creatures, the two female meerkats introduced to the HKZBG are aged 4 and 5, and are housed in the newly-decorated &quot;Meerkat&#x27;s Home&quot;.

In 2020, The mammal and reptile section of the Zoological &amp; Botanical Gardens were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 epidemic. The mammal families at the gardens expanded during the epidemic.

To celebrate its 150th anniversary in 2021, a female Asian small-clawed otter and red necked wallaby were introduced to the HKZBG.

Yellow-cheeked gibbons, ring-tailed lemurs, white-faced saki, black-and-white ruffed lemurs and cotton-top tamarins all welcomed new additions to the family.

The reptiles are primarily snakes, crocodilians, and turtles such as the African spurred tortoise, radiated tortoise, Chinese alligator and Burmese python.

===Birds===

Over 100 avian species have successfully reared young, including the Japanese red-crowned crane, peacock pheasant and the Bali mynah, all of which are highly endangered in the wild.

Just outside the greenhouse are several large aviaries housing species of waterfowl, such as the wood duck, flamingo, blue crane and intensely-coloured scarlet ibis, perching atop a man-made waterfall.

There are also terrestrial birds; many of them small, and with several species from East Asia and Africa. Yellow-casqued hornbill are among the HKZBG&#x27;s larger avian species.

An injured black-faced spoonbill was rescued in Nam Sang Wai by staff of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, and transferred to the KFBG Wild Animal Rescue Centre in March 2018. This spoonbill, which was unable to fly after an operation, will be able to join the other waterfowl at HKZBG, and so will have excellent human-provided care as well as companions in captivity.

To celebrate its 150th anniversary this year, the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens will hold a number of free public activities, in addition to adding black-crowned cranes, great white pelicans, and great curassow, in addition to bird-watching platforms.

The small brick buildings that house some of the smaller birds were once staff quarters, for Chinese workers at the park. These were recently renovated, resulting in the destruction of a row of defunct Victorian gas lamp posts; these may have been the last remaining such lamps in Hong Kong, and possibly in all of East Asia.

=== Animal welfare concerns ===

In 2014, the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; reported that the Kadoorie Institute, Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), Animals Asia Foundation, and orangutan foundation Orangutanaid all have expressed &quot;sincere doubts over the welfare of [the gardens&#x27;] animals&quot; and recommended that the park return to its origins as a botanical garden. SPCA deputy director Jane Grey criticised the gardens&#x27; facilities as being outdated, inadequate, and overcrowded, comparing it to a &quot;menagerie from the turn of the last century&quot;. Later that year, renowned primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall expressed her concern over the gardens&#x27; treatment of orangutans in Hong Kong&#x27;s zoo, saying that they were &quot;not in a good situation&quot; and that &quot;large animals in small cages with nothing to do are not happy animals&quot;.

In 2024, 12 monkeys were found dead, reportedly due to melioidosis, a bacterial infection spread through contact with contaminated soil. The monkey deaths included critically endangered cotton-top tamarins as well as white-faced sakis and a De Brazza&#x27;s monkey.

==Transport==
The main entrance is located at Upper Albert Road. A number of bus routes give access to the facility. Admission is free to all parts of the Zoological and Botanical Gardens.

<text>Hazel Carter (1894–1918) is American soldier. 

== Early life ==
Carter was born in 1894 in the Huachuca Mountains outside of Douglas, Arizona Territory. She was known as a skilled hunter and farmer. According to her father Peter Blauser, Carter graduated from college but chose to live a life on a ranch where she tended to 200 cattle and 16 saddle horses. She married John J. Carter on December 12, 1916.

== World War I involvement ==
When her husband was sent to France on the first American contingent to fight in World War I, she first tried to join the Red Cross in Douglas, but was not accepted. Carter then cut her hair short and stole an Army uniform. She boarded the same train as the one carrying her husband and went undetected for two days when she was forced off the train and told to go back to Douglas. However, she got back on the train. At the port, she was able to get onto a ship and stow away. Carter claims her husband did not know of her presence on the train until they neared Chicago. The contingent was five days at sea when her identity was revealed. Her voice was what eventually gave her away and Captain Eugene D. Rideout realized that she was a woman. Upon arrival on the shores of Europe, she was not permitted to disembark from the ship&#x27;s deck.

A request by Carter to remain as a nurse was refused. Her husband was demoted from corporal to private as a result of the debacle. Carter states that her mother did not know she was stowing away. Carter&#x27;s American Civil War veteran grandfather, H. Clark remarked how proud he was of his granddaughter, stating &quot;I knew she would do it…That girl sure has grit. I wish she could stay and fight the Germans. You ought to have seen her in uniform. She made a better looking soldier than John, I do believe. She can handle a rifle better than most men. They sure should have let her stay.&quot;

On return, she was detained and questioned at the police headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. She then moved on to Atlantic City, New Jersey. A hero&#x27;s welcome was planned for her return to Douglas. Carter was met by a brass band and supporters. She also wrote about her experiences and her account was published by The Bell Syndicate. Carter authored a series of four articles detailing her experience that were serialized nationally by several newspaper companies.

== Death ==
Before her death, she intended on earning enough money to return to France to serve as an Army nurse. Carter died in Lordsburg, New Mexico, on July 11, 1918, after being ill for two days. Her husband was still fighting overseas when she passed. It was said by friends that her health declined after her return and they believed she died of a &quot;broken heart.&quot; Carter&#x27;s body was returned to Douglas for burial and she was given a military funeral with a military chaplain and six soldiers as pallbearers. In 1918 after the funeral, it was reported by her cousin, Ella Murphy, that Carter&#x27;s was the first military funeral held in the United States for a woman.

<doc id="486077" wikidata="Q1131329" url="?curid=486077" title="Grotto">
<text>A grotto or grot is a natural or artificial cave or covered recess. 
Naturally occurring grottoes are often small caves near water that are usually flooded or often flooded at high tide. 
Sometimes, artificial grottoes are used as garden features. The &quot;Grotta Azzurra&quot; at Capri and the grotto at Tiberius&#x27; Villa Jovis in the Bay of Naples are examples of popular natural seashore grottoes.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;grotto&quot; comes from Italian &quot;grotta&quot;, Vulgar Latin &quot;grupta&quot;, and Latin &quot;crypta&quot; (&quot;a crypt&quot;). It is also related by a historical accident to the word &quot;grotesque&quot;. In the late 15th century, Romans accidentally unearthed Nero&#x27;s &quot;Domus Aurea&quot; on the Palatine Hill, a series of rooms, decorated with designs of garlands, slender architectural framework, foliage, and animals. The rooms had sunk underground over time. The Romans who discovered this historical monument found it very strange, partly because it was uncovered from an &quot;underworld&quot; source. This led the Romans of that era to give it the name &quot;grottesca&quot;, from which came the French &quot;grotesque&quot;.

==Antiquity==

Grottoes were very popular in Greek and Roman culture. Spring-fed grottoes were a feature of Apollo&#x27;s oracles at Delphi, Corinth, and Clarus. The Hellenistic city of Rhodes was designed with rock-cut artificial grottoes incorporated into the city, made to look natural. At the great Roman sanctuary of Praeneste south of Rome, the oldest portion of the primitive sanctuary was situated on the second lowest terrace, in a grotto in the natural rock where a spring developed into a well. According to tradition, Praeneste&#x27;s sacred spring had a native nymph, who was honored in a grotto-like watery nymphaeum.

==Cellars in Ticino==

In Ticino, the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, grottoes were places where wine and food were stored and preserved. They were built by exploiting the morphology of rocks and boulders, to create rooms with a cool climate suitable for food, particularly milk and cheese, as well as potatoes, sausages, and wine storage.

The importance of these cellars is demonstrated in their number; for example, there are 40 grotti in Maggia, no fewer in Moghegno, and about 70 in Cevio behind Case Franzoni. Some grotti have been opened to the public, as in Avegno, but most have lost their original character as they became rustic restaurants which serve basic local food and drink. A true grotto is dug out under a rock or between two boulders, where subterranean air currents keep the room cool. Often a grotto had a second floor with another one or two rooms for the fermentation cask and tools of the vintage. In front of the grotto were a table and benches of stone, where the farmers could rest and refresh themselves.

== Garden grottoes ==

The popularity of artificial grottoes introduced the Mannerist style to Italian and French gardens of the mid-16th century. Two famous grottoes in the Boboli Gardens of Palazzo Pitti were begun by Vasari and completed by Ammanati and Buontalenti between 1583 and 1593. One of these grottoes originally housed the &quot;Prisoners&quot; of Michelangelo. Before the Boboli grotto, a garden was laid out by Niccolò Tribolo at the Medici Villa Castello, near Florence. At Pratolino, in spite of the dryness of the site, there was a Grotto of Cupid (surviving), with water tricks for the unsuspecting visitor. The Fonte di Fata Morgana (&quot;Fata Morgana&#x27;s Spring&quot;) at Grassina, not far from Florence, is a small garden building, built in 1573–74 as a garden feature in the extensive grounds of the Villa &quot;Riposo&quot; (rest) of Bernardo Vecchietti. It is decorated with sculptures in the Giambolognan manner.

The outsides of garden grottoes are often designed to look like an enormous rock, a rustic porch, or a rocky overhang. Inside, they are decorated as a temple or with fountains, stalactites, and imitation gems and shells (sometimes made in ceramic); herms and mermaids, mythological subjects suited to the space; and naiads, or river gods whose urns spilled water into pools. Damp grottoes were cool places to retreat from the Italian sun, but they also became fashionable in the cool drizzle of the Île-de-France. In the Kuskovo Estate, there is the Grotto Pavilion, built between 1755 and 1761.
Grottoes could also serve as baths; an example of this is at the Palazzo del Te, in the &#x27;Casino della Grotta&#x27;, where a small suite of intimate rooms is laid out around a grotto and &quot;loggetta&quot; (covered balcony). Courtiers once bathed in the small cascade that splashed over the pebbles and shells encrusted in the floor and walls.

Grottoes have also served as chapels, or at Villa Farnese at Caprarola, a little theater designed in the grotto manner. They were often combined with cascading fountains in Renaissance gardens.

The grotto designed by Bernard Palissy for Catherine de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s château in Paris, the Tuileries, was renowned. There are also grottoes in the gardens designed by André Le Nôtre for Versailles. In England, an early garden grotto was built at Wilton House in the 1630s, probably by Isaac de Caus.

Grottoes were suitable for less formal gardens too. Pope&#x27;s Grotto, created by Alexander Pope, is almost all that survives of one of the first landscape gardens in England, at Twickenham. Pope was inspired after seeing grottoes in Italy during a visit there. Efforts are underway to restore his grotto. There are grottoes in the landscape gardens of Painshill Park, Stowe, Clandon Park, and Stourhead. Scott&#x27;s Grotto is a series of interconnected chambers, extending 67 ft (20 metres) into the chalk hillside on the outskirts of Ware, Hertfordshire. Built during the late 18th century, the chambers and tunnels are lined with shells, flints, and pieces of colored glass. The Romantic generation of tourists might not actually visit Fingal&#x27;s Cave, on the remote isle of Staffa in the Scottish Hebrides, but they have often heard of it, perhaps through Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Hebrides Overture&quot;, better known as &quot;Fingal&#x27;s Cave&quot;, which was inspired by his visit. In the 19th century, when miniature Matterhorns and rock gardens became fashionable, a grotto was often found, such as at Ascott House. In Bavaria, Ludwig&#x27;s Linderhof contains an abstraction of the grotto under Venusberg, which is figured in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;.

Although grottoes have largely fallen from fashion since the British Picturesque movement, architects and artists occasionally try to redefine the grotto in contemporary design works. Such examples include Frederick Kiesler&#x27;s &quot;Grotto of Meditation for New Harmony&quot; (1964), ARM&#x27;st post-modern &quot;Storey Hall&quot; (1995), Aranda/Lasch&#x27;s &quot;Grotto Concept,&quot; (2005), DSDHA&#x27;s &quot;Potters Field Park Pavilions&quot; (2008)&quot;,&quot; Callum Moreton&#x27;s &quot;Grotto&quot; pavilion (2010), and Antonino Cardillo&#x27;s &quot;Grottoes&quot; series (2013–2023).

==Religious grottoes ==
Today, artificial grottoes are purchased and built for ornamental and devotional purposes. They are often used as shrines in which to place statues of saints, particularly the Virgin Mary, in outdoor gardens.

Many Roman Catholics visit a grotto where Bernadette Soubirous saw apparitions of Our Lady of Lourdes. Numerous garden shrines are modeled after these apparitions. They can commonly be found displayed in gardens and churches, among other places (see Lourdes grotto).

The largest grotto is believed to be the Grotto of the Redemption in West Bend, Iowa.

<doc id="486086" wikidata="Q218248" url="?curid=486086" title="Grotesque">
<text>Since at least the 18th century (in French and German, as well as English), grotesque has come to be used as a general adjective for the strange, mysterious, magnificent, fantastic, hideous, ugly, incongruous, unpleasant, or disgusting, and thus is often used to describe weird shapes and distorted forms such as Halloween masks. In art, performance, and literature, however, &quot;grotesque&quot; may also refer to something that simultaneously invokes an audience feeling of uncomfortable bizarreness as well as sympathetic pity.

The English word first appears in the 1560s as a noun borrowed from French, itself originally from the Italian &quot;grottesca&quot; (literally &quot;of a cave&quot; from the Italian &quot;grotta&quot;, &#x27;cave&#x27;; see grotto), an extravagant style of ancient Roman decorative art rediscovered at Rome at the end of the fifteenth century and subsequently imitated. The word was first used of paintings found on the walls of basements of ruins in Rome that were called at that time &quot;le Grotte&quot; (&#x27;the caves&#x27;). These &#x27;caves&#x27; were in fact rooms and corridors of the Domus Aurea, the unfinished palace complex started by Nero after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64, which had become overgrown and buried, until they were broken into again, mostly from above. Spreading from Italian to the other European languages, the term was long used largely interchangeably with arabesque and moresque for types of decorative patterns using curving foliage elements.

Rémi Astruc has argued that although there is an immense variety of motifs and figures, the three main tropes of the grotesque are doubleness, hybridity and metamorphosis. Beyond the current understanding of the grotesque as an aesthetic category, he demonstrated how the grotesque functions as a fundamental existential experience. Moreover, Astruc identifies the grotesque as a crucial, and potentially universal, anthropological device that societies have used to conceptualize alterity and change. 

==History==
===Early examples in Roman ornament===
In art, grotesques are ornamental arrangements of arabesques with interlaced garlands and small and fantastic human and animal figures, usually set out in a symmetrical pattern around some form of architectural framework, though this may be very flimsy. Such designs were fashionable in ancient Rome, especially as fresco wall decoration and floor mosaic. Stylized versions, common in Imperial Roman decoration, were decried by Vitruvius (c. 30 BC) who, in dismissing them as meaningless and illogical, offered the following description: 
 For example, reeds are substituted for columns, fluted appendages with curly leaves and volutes take the place of pediments, candelabra support representations of shrines, and on top of their roofs grow slender stalks and volutes with human figures senselessly seated upon them.

Emperor Nero&#x27;s palace in Rome, the Domus Aurea, was rediscovered by chance in the late 15th century, buried in fifteen hundred years of land fill. Access into the palace&#x27;s remains was from above, requiring visitors to be lowered into it using ropes as in a cave, or &quot;grotte&quot; in Italian. The palace&#x27;s wall decorations in fresco and delicate stucco were a revelation.

===Etymology in Renaissance===

The first appearance of the word &quot;grottesche&quot; appears in a contract of 1502 for the Piccolomini Library attached to the duomo of Siena. They were introduced by Raphael Sanzio and his team of decorative painters, who developed &quot;grottesche&quot; into a complete system of ornament in the Loggias that are part of the series of Raphael&#x27;s Rooms in the Vatican Palace, Rome. &quot;The decorations astonished and charmed a generation of artists that was familiar with the grammar of the classical orders but had not guessed till then that in their private houses the Romans had often disregarded those rules and had adopted instead a more fanciful and informal style that was all lightness, elegance and grace.&quot; In these grotesque decorations a tablet or candelabrum might provide a focus; frames were extended into scrolls that formed part of the surrounding designs as a kind of scaffold, as Peter Ward-Jackson noted. Light scrolling grotesques could be ordered by confining them within the framing of a pilaster to give them more structure. Giovanni da Udine took up the theme of grotesques in decorating the Villa Madama, the most influential of the new Roman villas.

In the 16th century, such artistic license and irrationality was controversial matter. Francisco de Holanda puts a defense in the mouth of Michelangelo in his third dialogue of &quot;Da Pintura Antiga&quot;, 1548:
&quot;this insatiable desire of man sometimes prefers to an ordinary building, with its pillars and doors, one falsely constructed in grotesque style, with pillars formed of children growing out of stalks of flowers, with architraves and cornices of branches of myrtle and doorways of reeds and other things, all seeming impossible and contrary to reason, yet it may be really great work if it is performed by a skillful artist.&quot;

===Mannerism===

The delight of Mannerist artists and their patrons in arcane iconographic programs available only to the erudite could be embodied in schemes of &quot;grottesche&quot;, Andrea Alciato&#x27;s &quot;Emblemata&quot; (1522) offered ready-made iconographic shorthand for vignettes. More familiar material for grotesques could be drawn from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

The Vatican loggias, a loggia corridor space in the Apostolic Palace open to the elements on one side, were decorated around 1519 by Raphael&#x27;s large team of artists, with Giovanni da Udine the main hand involved. Because of the relative unimportance of the space, and a desire to copy the Domus Aurea style, no large paintings were used, and the surfaces were mostly covered with grotesque designs on a white background, with paintings imitating sculptures in niches, and small figurative subjects in a revival of Ancient Roman style. This large array provided a repertoire of elements that were the basis for later artists across Europe.

In Michelangelo&#x27;s Medici Chapel Giovanni da Udine composed during 1532–1533 &quot;most beautiful sprays of foliage, rosettes and other ornaments in stucco and gold&quot; in the coffers and &quot;sprays of foliage, birds, masks and figures&quot;, with a result that did not please Pope Clement VII Medici, however, nor Giorgio Vasari, who whitewashed the grotesque decor in 1556. Counter Reformation writers on the arts, notably Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti, bishop of Bologna, turned upon &quot;grottesche&quot; with a righteous vengeance.

Vasari, echoing Vitruvius, described the style as follows:&quot;Grotesques are a type of extremely licentious and absurd painting done by the ancients ... without any logic, so that a weight is attached to a thin thread which could not support it, a horse is given legs made of leaves, a man has crane&#x27;s legs, with countless other impossible absurdities; and the bizarrer the painter&#x27;s imagination, the higher he was rated&quot;.

Vasari recorded that Francesco Ubertini, called &quot;Bacchiacca&quot;, delighted in inventing &quot;grotteschi&quot;, and (about 1545) painted for Duke Cosimo de&#x27; Medici a &quot;studiolo&quot; in a mezzanine at the Palazzo Vecchio &quot;full of animals and rare plants&quot;. Other 16th-century writers on &quot;grottesche&quot; included Daniele Barbaro, Pirro Ligorio and Gian Paolo Lomazzo.

===Engravings, woodwork, book illustration, decorations===

In the meantime, through the medium of engravings the grotesque mode of surface ornament passed into the European artistic repertory of the 16th century, from Spain to Poland. A classic suite was that attributed to Enea Vico, published in 1540–41 under an evocative explanatory title, &quot;Leviores et extemporaneae picturae quas grotteschas vulgo vocant&quot;, &quot;Light and extemporaneous pictures that are vulgarly called grotesques&quot;. Later Mannerist versions, especially in engraving, tended to lose that initial lightness and be much more densely filled than the airy well-spaced style used by the Romans and Raphael.

Soon &quot;grottesche&quot; appeared in marquetry (fine woodwork), in maiolica produced above all at Urbino from the late 1520s, then in book illustration and in other decorative uses. At Fontainebleau Rosso Fiorentino and his team enriched the vocabulary of grotesques by combining them with the decorative form of strapwork, the portrayal of leather straps in plaster or wood moldings, which forms an element in grotesques.

===From Baroque to Victorian era===
In the 17th and 18th centuries the grotesque encompasses a wide field of teratology (science of monsters) and artistic experimentation. The monstrous, for instance, often occurs as the notion of &quot;play&quot;. The sportiveness of the grotesque category can be seen in the notion of the preternatural category of the &quot;lusus naturae&quot;, in natural history writings and in cabinets of curiosities. The last vestiges of romance, such as the marvellous also provide opportunities for the presentation of the grotesque in, for instance, operatic spectacle. The mixed form of the novel was commonly described as grotesque – see for instance Fielding&#x27;s &quot;comic epic poem in prose&quot; (&quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; and &quot;Tom Jones&quot;).

Grotesque ornament received a further impetus from new discoveries of original Roman frescoes and stucchi at Pompeii and the other buried sites round Mount Vesuvius from the middle of the century. It continued in use, becoming increasingly heavy, in the Empire Style and then in the Victorian period, when designs often became as densely packed as in 16th-century engravings, and the elegance and fancy of the style tended to be lost.

==Extensions of the term in art==
Artists began to give the tiny faces of the figures in grotesque decorations strange caricatured expressions, in a direct continuation of the medieval traditions of the drolleries in the border decorations or initials in illuminated manuscripts. From this the term began to be applied to larger caricatures, such as those of Leonardo da Vinci, and the modern sense began to develop. It is first recorded in English in 1646 from Sir Thomas Browne: &quot;In nature there are no grotesques&quot;. By extension backwards in time, the term became also used for the medieval originals, and in modern terminology medieval drolleries, half-human thumbnail vignettes drawn in the margins, and carved figures on buildings (that are not also waterspouts, and so gargoyles) are also called &quot;grotesques&quot;.

A boom in the production of works of art in the grotesque genre characterized the 1920–1933 period of German art. In contemporary illustration art, the &quot;grotesque&quot; figures, in the ordinary conversational sense, commonly appear in the genre &quot;grotesque art&quot;, also known as fantastic art.

==In literature==
One of the first uses of the term grotesque to denote a literary genre is in Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;. The Grotesque is often linked with satire and tragicomedy. It is an effective artistic means to convey grief and pain to the audience, and for this has been labeled by Thomas Mann as the &quot;genuine antibourgeois style&quot;.

Some of the earliest written texts describe grotesque happenings and monstrous creatures. The literature of myth has been a rich source of monsters; from the one-eyed Cyclops from Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; to Homer&#x27;s Polyphemus in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is another rich source for grotesque transformations and hybrid creatures of myth. Horace&#x27;s &quot;Art of Poetry&quot; also provides a formal introduction to classical values and to the dangers of grotesque or mixed form. Indeed, the departure from classical models of order, reason, harmony, balance and form opens up the risk of entry into grotesque worlds. Accordingly, British literature abounds with native grotesquerie, from the strange worlds of Spenser&#x27;s allegory in &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; to the tragi-comic modes of 16th-century drama. (Grotesque comic elements can be found in major works such as &quot;King Lear&quot;.)

Literary works of &quot;mixed&quot; genre are occasionally termed grotesque, as are &quot;low&quot; or non-literary genres such as pantomime and farce. Gothic writings often have grotesque components in terms of character, style and location. In other cases, the environment described may be grotesque – whether urban (Charles Dickens), or the literature of the American south which has sometimes been termed &quot;Southern Gothic&quot;. Sometimes the grotesque in literature has been explored in terms of social and cultural formations such as the carnival(-esque) in François Rabelais and Mikhail Bakhtin. Terry Castle has written on the relationship between metamorphosis, literary writings and masquerade.

Another major source of the grotesque is in satirical writings of the 18th century. Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; provides a variety of approaches to grotesque representation. Corporeal hybridity is an essential marker in Swift. In poetry, the works of Alexander Pope provide many examples of the grotesque.

In fiction, characters are usually considered &quot;grotesque&quot; if they induce both empathy and disgust. (A character who inspires disgust alone is simply a villain or a monster.) Obvious examples would include the physically deformed and the mentally deficient, but people with cringe-worthy social traits are also included. The reader becomes piqued by the grotesque&#x27;s positive side, and continues reading to see if the character can conquer their darker side. In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, the figure of Caliban has inspired more nuanced reactions than simple scorn and disgust. Also, in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the character of Gollum may be considered to have both disgusting and empathetic qualities, which fit the grotesque template.

Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; is one of the most celebrated grotesques in literature. Dr. Frankenstein&#x27;s monster from Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot; can also be considered a grotesque, as well as the title character, Erik in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; and the Beast in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. Other instances of the romantic grotesque are also to be found in Edgar Allan Poe, E. T. A. Hoffmann, in &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; literature or in Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. The romantic grotesque is far more terrible and sombre than the medieval grotesque, which celebrated laughter and fertility. It is at this point that a grotesque creature such as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster begins to be presented more sympathetically as the outsider who is the victim of society. But the novel also makes the issue of sympathy problematic in an unkind society. This means that society becomes the generator of the grotesque, by a process of alienation. In fact, the grotesque monster in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; tends to be described as &quot;the creature&quot;.

The grotesque received a new shape with &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; by Lewis Carroll, when a girl meets fantastic grotesque figures in her fantasy world. Carroll manages to make the figures seem less frightful and fit for children&#x27;s literature, but still utterly strange. Another comic grotesque writer who played on the relationship between sense and nonsense was Edward Lear. Humorous, or festive nonsense of this kind has its roots in the seventeenth century traditions of fustian, bombastic and satirical writing.

During the nineteenth-century category of grotesque body was increasingly displaced by the notion of congenital deformity or medical anomaly. Building on this context, the grotesque begins to be understood more as deformity and disability, especially after the First World War, 1914–18. In these terms, the art historian Leah Dickerman has argued that &quot;The sight of horrendously shattered bodies of veterans returned to the home front became commonplace. The accompanying growth in the prosthetic industry struck contemporaries as creating a race of half-mechanical men and became an important theme in dadaist work.&#x27; The poetry of Wilfred Owen displays a poetic and realistic sense of the grotesque horror of war and the human cost of brutal conflict. Poems such as &quot;Spring Offensive&quot; and &quot;Greater Love&quot; combined images of beauty with shocking brutality and violence in order to produce a sense of the grotesque clash of opposites. In a similar fashion, Ernst Friedrich (1894–1967), founder of the Berlin Peace Museum, an anarchist and a pacifist, was the author of &quot;War Against War&quot; (1924) which used grotesque photographs of mutilated victims of the First World War in order to campaign for peace.

Southern Gothic is a genre frequently identified with grotesques and William Faulkner is often cited as the leading exponent. Flannery O&#x27;Connor wrote, &quot;Whenever I&#x27;m asked why Southern writers particularly have a penchant for writing about freaks, I say it is because we are still able to recognize one&quot; (&quot;Some Aspects of the Grotesque in Southern Fiction&quot;, 1960). In O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s often-anthologized short story &quot;A Good Man Is Hard to Find&quot;, the Misfit, a serial killer, is clearly a maimed soul, utterly callous to human life, but driven to seek the truth. The less obvious grotesque is the polite, doting grandmother who is unaware of her own astonishing selfishness. Another oft-cited example of the grotesque from O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s work is her short story entitled &quot;A Temple of the Holy Ghost&quot;. The American novelist Raymond Kennedy is another author associated with the literary tradition of the grotesque.

==Contemporary writers==

Contemporary writers of literary grotesque fiction include Ian McEwan, Katherine Dunn, Alasdair Gray, Angela Carter, Jeanette Winterson, Umberto Eco, Patrick McGrath, Jessica Anthony, Natsuo Kirino, Paul Tremblay, Matt Bell, Chuck Palahniuk, Brian Evenson, Caleb J. Ross (who writes domestic grotesque fiction), Richard Thomas and many authors who write in the bizarro genre of fiction.

== Pop culture ==
Other contemporary writers who have explored the grotesque in pop-culture are John Docker, in the context of postmodernism; Cintra Wilson, who analyzes celebrity; and Francis Sanzaro, who discusses its relation to childbirth and obscenity. 

&quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997) is the only film rated by the MPAA to have &quot;grotesque images&quot; in its rating description, mainly due to its depiction of the Newborn xenomorph and the failed clones of Ellen Ripley, who all featured grotesque human–alien (hybrid) characteristics.

Grotesque manner also can be found at Disney&#x27;s famous ride, The Haunted Mansion at Disneyland, Walt Disney World and other theme parks, where some of its details may contain a symbolism of Memento Mori, Samsara&#x27;s circle or themes describing the fragility of human existence, passions that baffle and how they could be avoided or find a &quot;way out&quot;.

==Theatre of the Grotesque==
The term &quot;Theatre of the Grotesque&quot; refers to an anti-naturalistic school of Italian dramatists, writing in the 1910s and 1920s, who are often seen as precursors of the Theatre of the Absurd.
Characterized by ironic and macabre themes of daily life in the World War 1 era, Theatre of the Grotesque was named after the play &#x27;The Mask and the Face&#x27; by Luigi Chiarelli, which was described as &#x27;a grotesque in three acts.&#x27;

Friedrich Dürrenmatt is a major author of contemporary grotesque comedy plays.

==In architecture==
In architecture the term &quot;grotesque&quot; means a carved stone figure.

Grotesques are often confused with gargoyles, but the distinction is that gargoyles are figures that contain a water spout through the mouth, while grotesques do not. Without a water spout, this type of sculpture is also known as a chimera when it depicts fantastical creatures. In the Middle Ages, the term &quot;babewyn&quot; was used to refer to both gargoyles and grotesques. This word is derived from the Italian word &quot;babbuino&quot;, which means &quot;baboon&quot;.

==In typography==

The word &quot;grotesque&quot;, or &quot;Grotesk&quot; in German, is also frequently used as a synonym for sans-serif in typography. At other times, it is used (along with &quot;neo-grotesque&quot;, &quot;humanist&quot;, &quot;lineal&quot;, and &quot;geometric&quot;) to describe a particular style or subset of sans-serif typefaces. The origin of this association can be traced back to English typefounder William Thorowgood, who introduced the term &quot;grotesque&quot; and in 1835 produced &quot;7-line pica grotesque&quot;—the first sans-serif typeface containing actual lowercase letters. An alternate etymology is possibly based on the original reaction of other typographers to such a strikingly featureless typeface.

Popular grotesque typefaces include Franklin Gothic, News Gothic, Haettenschweiler, and Lucida Sans (although the latter lacks the spurred &quot;G&quot;), whereas popular neo-grotesque typefaces include Arial, Helvetica, and Verdana.

<doc id="486112" wikidata="Q248970" url="?curid=486112" title="Berklee College of Music">
<text>Berklee College of Music () is a private music college in Boston, Massachusetts. It is the largest independent college of contemporary music in the world. Known for the study of jazz and modern American music, it also offers college-level courses in a wide range of contemporary and historic styles, including rock, hip hop, reggae, salsa, heavy metal and bluegrass.

Since 2012, Berklee College of Music has also operated a campus in Valencia, Spain. In December 2015, Berklee College of Music and the Boston Conservatory agreed to a merger. The combined institution is known as Berklee, with the conservatory becoming The Boston Conservatory at Berklee. Berklee alumni have won 310 Grammy Awards, more than any other college, and 108 Latin Grammy Awards. Other accolades for its alumni include 34 Emmy Awards, seven Tony Awards, eight Academy Awards, and three Saturn Awards.

==History==
===Schillinger House (1945–1954)===
In 1945, pianist, composer, arranger and MIT graduate Lawrence Berk founded Schillinger House, the precursor to the Berklee School of Music, after quitting his job at Raytheon. Located at 284 Newbury St. in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay, the school specialized in the Schillinger System of harmony and composition developed by Joseph Schillinger. Berk had studied with Schillinger. Instrumental lessons and a few classes in traditional theory, harmony, and arranging were also offered. At the time of its founding almost all music schools focused on classical music, but Schillinger House offered training in jazz and commercial music for radio, theater, television, and dancing. At first, most students were working professional musicians. Many students were former World War II service members funded through the G.I. Bill. Initial enrollment was fewer than 50 students, but by 1949 there were more than 500 students. In 1954, when the school&#x27;s curriculum had expanded to include music education classes and more traditional music theory, Berk changed the name to Berklee School of Music, after his 12-year-old son Lee Eliot Berk, to reflect the broader scope of instruction.

===Berklee School of Music (1954–1970)===
Lawrence Berk emphasized learning from practitioners, as opposed to academics, and generally hired working musicians as faculty members. Several of the school&#x27;s best-known musician-educators arrived after the school&#x27;s name change. In 1956, trumpeter Herb Pomeroy joined the faculty and remained until his retirement in 1996. Drummer Alan Dawson and saxophonist Charlie Mariano became faculty members in 1957. Reed player John LaPorta began teaching in 1962. Like many of Berk&#x27;s ideas, this practice continues. Although far more emphasis is placed on academic credentials among new faculty hires than in the past, experienced performers such as Gary Burton, Mick Goodrick, Pat Metheny, Arif Mardin, Aydin Esen, Hal Crook, Joe Lovano, Danilo Perez, and others have served as faculty over the years.

Also during the mid-1950s, the school began to attract more international students. For example, Japanese pianist Toshiko Akiyoshi arrived in 1956. Multiple Grammy-winning producer Arif Mardin came from Turkey to study at the school in 1958.

In 1957, Berklee initiated the use of technology in music education with &quot;Jazz in the Classroom&quot;, a series of LP recordings of student work, accompanied by scores. These albums contain early examples of composing, arranging, and performing by students who went on to prominent jazz careers, such as Gary Burton, John Abercrombie, John Scofield, Ernie Watts, Alan Broadbent, Sadao Watanabe, and many others. The series, which continued until 1980, was a precursor to subsequent Berklee-affiliated recording labels. These later releases provided learning experiences not only for student composers and performers, but also for students in the new majors in music engineering and production, and music business and management.

Berklee awarded its first bachelor of music degrees in 1966. Members of the first graduating class to receive degrees included Alf Clausen, Stephen Gould and Michael Rendish. Gould taught film scoring at Berklee and became the program director for the Educational Leadership PhD program at Lesley University. During the 1960s, the Berklee curriculum began to reflect new developments in popular music, such the rise of rock and roll, soul and funk, and jazz-rock fusion. In 1962, Berklee offered the first college-level instrumental major for guitar. The guitar department began with nine students, and developed into the largest instrumental major at the college. Guitarist Jack Petersen accepted an invitation by Berk to design and chair the first formal guitar curriculum. Berk discovered Petersen through his affiliation with the Stan Kenton Band Clinics. Trombonist Phil Wilson joined the faculty in 1965. His student ensemble, the Dues Band, helped introduce contemporary popular music into the ensemble curriculum, and later as the Rainbow Band, performed world music and jazz fusions. In 1969, courses in rock and popular music were added to the curriculum, the first to be offered at the college level. The first college course on jingle writing was also offered in 1969.

===Berklee College of Music (1970–present)===

The school became Berklee College of Music in 1970 and bestowed its first honorary doctorate on Duke Ellington in 1971. Vibraphonist Gary Burton joined the faculty in 1971, helping to solidify the place of jazz-rock fusion in the curriculum. As Dean of Curriculum from 1985 to 1996, Burton led the development of several new majors, including music synthesis and songwriting, and facilitated the school&#x27;s transition to technology-based education. Curriculum innovations during the 1970s included the first college-level instrumental major in electric bass guitar in 1973, and the first jazz-rock ensemble class in 1974.

In 1979, Berklee founder Lawrence Berk stepped down as president. The board of trustees appointed his son, Lee Eliot Berk, to replace him. Under new leadership, the school underwent further growth and diversification of its curriculum. The college offered the world&#x27;s first undergraduate degree program in film scoring starting in 1980. Beginning in 1981, the string department curriculum expanded to include many stylistic idioms besides classical music. In 1986, the world&#x27;s first college-level major in music synthesis was offered, followed by the world&#x27;s first college songwriting major in 1987. Instrumental majors also expanded to include the first college hand-percussion major in 1988. The college was also the first third-level institution in the world to offer a course in Electric Bass Guitar. While many conservatories offer a major in Double Bass, Berklee&#x27;s former bass chair Rich Appleman was a pioneer in bass education and understood the impact this change could bring.

The number of international students has grown steadily to 24.2% of total enrollment in 2010 and 28% .

Berklee expanded its community outreach efforts in 1991 with the launch of City Music, a program designed to make music instruction available to underserved youth in the Boston area. On a global scale, Berklee partnered with selected music schools around the world to form the Berklee International Network in 1993. Other new majors, in Music Business &amp; Management and music therapy, were offered beginning in 1994 and 1996 respectively. In 2003, the school began offering classes online through Berkleemusic.com, called Berklee Online under the leadership of Dave Kusek. Other curriculum developments included the incorporation of a hip-hop course in 2004.

In 2004, Lee Eliot Berk stepped down as president of the school his father had founded, and Roger H. Brown was installed as the college&#x27;s third president. Under Brown&#x27;s leadership the college&#x27;s enrollment has grown and diversified, admission has become highly selective, and significant increases have occurred in the retention (above 80% in 2016) and graduation rate (above 60% in 2015). In 2006, mandolin and banjo were accepted as principal instruments for the first time. The college also initiated an Africana Studies program, the Berklee Global Jazz Institute, and an American Roots Music Program. In October 2013, Berklee Online launched its online degree programs, and began accepting applications for the Bachelor of Professional Studies in two majors: music production, and music business. In January 2014, the college launched the Berklee Institute for Creative Entrepreneurship (Berklee ICE), a new campus center which offers courses, workshops, research and an incubation environment to encourage music businesses startup companies.

In June 2015, Berklee College of Music and The Boston Conservatory announced that the governing boards for the two schools had approved plans to pursue a proposed merger. On January 19, 2016, the two schools announced that they would be merging. The agreement was signed the next day, with Berklee College of Music being renamed Berklee, and the Conservatory being renamed The Boston Conservatory at Berklee.

On October 22, 2020, Berklee announced its new president-elect, Erica Muhl, as President Brown announced his retirement. Muhl previously worked at the University of Southern California (USC), where she was dean and founding executive director of the Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation.

For the fall semester of 2020, the college taught classes remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The college then moved to a hybrid model learning system in the spring semester of 2021.

In August 2021, Berklee College of Music announced it would begin offering a Bachelor of Arts program in Music Industry Leadership and Innovation starting in the fall of 2022. The program will be the first undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree to be available in the college&#x27;s history.

In 2025, Berklee College of Music, alongside Ben Zakharenko and Dayvin, were announced as one of the remixers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup theme, representing the Boston area.

=== List of college presidents ===
====Sexual harassment allegations====
In November 2017, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported a culture of sexual harassment existed on the campus, with at least three male professors allowed to quietly leave the school in 2008 after student reports of sexual misconduct with teachers. Berklee&#x27;s administrators released a statement saying, in part, that the college has rigorous policies and procedures in place to deal with claims of sexual harassment. On November 13, students staged a silent protest and class walkout to address the allegations of sexual harassment by teachers and staff. Also on November 13, college president Roger Brown addressed over 1,200 students, apologized to the affected students, and pledged to &quot;root out abusive behavior.&quot; He also stated that the school has terminated eleven faculty members in the past thirteen years due to sexual harassment and sexual assault. The college has worked to strengthen policies to prevent sexual harassment and abuse and has taken a number of measures to create a better and safer environment, including instituting &quot;training courses, creating a working group, and diversifying leadership.&quot;

==Academics==
Berklee College of Music is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE). The college stated that it was the first to offer online undergraduate degrees in 2002, and introduced graduate degrees in 2018, starting with programs in music production and music business.

==Admission==
Berklee&#x27;s admission process focuses primarily on an audition, an interview, and on the applicant&#x27;s academic record.

For the 2017–2018 school year, the acceptance rate for the Berklee College of Music Boston was 33.8%, for the Boston Conservatory it was 38%, and for Berklee Online it was 66%.

From 2014 to 2017, Berklee reported acceptance rates ranging from 28 to 36%. As of fall 2018, Admissions updated its applications reporting to count only paid applications. Previous years&#x27; totals includes all partial applications, regardless of status or payment.

Berklee offers three different terms for entering full-time students: the traditional fall semester, spring, and summer. Unlike other colleges, entering students may choose their own entering semester. Typically, the deadlines are November 1 (early action) and January 15 (regular action) for fall semester, July 1 for spring semester, and December 1 for summer semester.

As part of the application to the college, applicants are required to complete a live audition and interview. An integral part of selecting the entering class is the audition and interview experience, designed to show applicants&#x27; strengths while helping the school to assess applicants&#x27; talent and potential to succeed in Berklee&#x27;s dynamic environment. Although there is a general format for the audition and interview, each experience is unique. Berklee considers all applicants for both admission and scholarship through the audition and interview process. Starting in 2014, the college will audition some applicants online using high speed internet technology.

Berklee is known for its high cost of attendance, with the yearly undergraduate cost without aid at $73,391. The high cost of attendance has forced many low-income students to quit after the first two semesters, or take out large loans, as the school offers very few merit-based scholarships, and close to no need-based grants.

==Demographics==
As of the 2021–2022 academic year, total enrollment at Berklee was 7,943 (7,177 undergraduates and 766 graduates). Among undergraduate students, 42% were female and 58% were male. Among graduate students, 46% were female and 54% were male. 73 students out of the total 7,943 identified as transgender or gender diverse. Students from 97 countries outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 25% of the student population. China, Canada, India, Brazil, and Colombia were the top five countries of origin. In addition to students attending the Berklee campus in Boston, in the 2021–2022 academic year, 1,895 students took online courses through Berklee Online.

==Facilities==

Berklee remained at its original location at 284 Newbury Street from its founding in 1945 to 1966, when it moved into the larger 1140 Boylston Street building, the former Hotel Bostonian. Beginning in 1972 an era of more rapid expansion began with the purchase of the Fenway Theatre and the adjoining Sherry Biltmore Hotel at 150 Massachusetts Avenue. The theater was renovated and opened as the 1,227-seat Berklee Performance Center in 1976. The former Biltmore Hotel provided additional classroom and practice room spaces and residence halls. It also houses the library, which was renamed the Stan Getz Library and Media Center in 1998. The 150 Massachusetts Avenue building is also the site of the Berklee Learning Center, which when it opened in 1993, was the world&#x27;s largest networked computer learning facility for music education.

The Genko Uchida Center at 921 Boylston Street opened in 1997 and houses the offices for enrollment, admissions, scholarships and student employment, the registrar, financial aid, bursar, rehearsal and classroom space, and the 200-seat David Friend Recital Hall. At 939 Boylston Street, Café 939, the nation&#x27;s only student-run, all-ages night club, hosts a full program of student performers, local and national acts, and community programs.

, Berklee occupied 25 buildings primarily in the Back Bay area of Boston, near the intersection of Boylston Street and Massachusetts Avenue. Within these buildings were 40 recording studios, 5 film/video scoring and editing facilities, and 9 music synthesis facilities. The studios of the five-channel, commercial-free Berklee Internet Radio Network (BIRN), which launched in 2007, were also housed on campus. A new Liberal Arts building at 7 Haviland Street was dedicated in 2010. It houses the Liberal Arts, Music Therapy, and Music Business Departments, as well as the Africana Studies program.

In early 2011, Berklee College of Music announced its plan of constructing 3 new buildings along Massachusetts Avenue. The first building, a 16-story mixed-use building at 160 Massachusetts Avenue that include 370 dorm rooms, a two-story cafeteria, a performance center, of recording studios, and retail space, opened in February 2014. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; architecture critic Robert Campbell described it &quot;as (a) very good building&quot;. The building received the American Institute of Architects&#x27; 2015 Housing Award, being named one of the best 10 residential projects of the previous year. The second building is planned to be built on top of the existing 130–136 Massachusetts Avenue (The Berklee Performance Centre). The new building is expected to house additional 450 students, as well as a performing center, in its 24-story tall structure. The third building is planned to be at 161–171 Massachusetts Avenue, which is expected to contain more academic and administrative space for the Berklee College of Music.

==Berklee València==
Berklee València is the college&#x27;s first international campus, housed in the Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía. Queen Sofía Palace of the Arts is the final structure built as part of a grand City of Arts and Sciences concept designed by the Valencia-born and internationally known architect Santiago Calatrava, which began construction in 1995 and was opened on 8 October 2005.

===Special programs and professional certificates===
Berklee&#x27;s campus in València regularly offers unique programs in contemporary music. These include clinics, workshops, and seminars as well as short, concentrated sessions in areas such as performance, flamenco, film scoring, music business, technology and production, and education.

It also offers a two-week summer performance program in addition to the five-week program in Boston.

==BerkleeNYC==

BerkleeNYC is the college&#x27;s campus in New York. Housed in the Power Station studios in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, it offers a one year, three-semester, Master of Arts in Creative Technology.

==Boston Conservatory at Berklee==
On January 19, 2016, the Berklee and Boston Conservatory announced that they would merge under an institutional umbrella called Berklee, consisting of Boston Conservatory at Berklee, Berklee College of Music, Berklee Online, and Berklee Valencia.

==Berklee Online==

Berklee Online is the online extension school of Berklee College of Music. The school delivers access to Berklee&#x27;s curriculum to students around the world.

Berklee Online&#x27;s online music courses, multi-course certificate programs, and Bachelor of Professional Studies online degree programs are accredited and taught by the college&#x27;s faculty and industry professionals. The school also provides free Berklee online music resources through Berklee Shares, massive open online courses (MOOCs) including Coursera, EdX, and Kadenze.

From 2005 to 2012, the University Professional Continuing Education Association (UPCEA) awarded Berklee Online with its Best Online College Course Award. Since its inception, Berklee Online has taught more than 30,000 students from 144 countries.

Former Berklee Online students include members of Nine Inch Nails, Dave Matthews Band (Stefan Lessard), Karmin (Amy Heidemann), Sugarland (Annie Clements, Brandon Bush, Thad Beatty), and Train.

===Online degree programs===
In October 2013, the online school began accepting applications for its 120-credit online degree in two majors: Bachelor of Professional Studies in Music Production and Bachelor of Professional Studies in Music Business. In November 2014, Berklee Online added three new degree majors to its Bachelor of Professional Studies program: Electronic Music Production and Sound Design, Music Composition for Film, TV, and Games, and Interdisciplinary Music Studies, a major that allows students to build their own program based on their musical interests and goals. Since then, the college has continued to expand its online bachelor&#x27;s degree major offerings, adding Guitar, Songwriting, and Songwriting and Producing Music to the roster. The college is reportedly the first nonprofit music institution to offer regionally accredited bachelor&#x27;s degrees online.

== Scholarly publications ==
Since 2005, Berklee has published the &quot;Music Business Journal&quot;, which publishes articles on the music industry.

<doc id="486117" wikidata="Q263994" url="?curid=486117" title="Quinary">
<text>Quinary (base 5 or pental) is a numeral system with five as the base. A possible origination of a quinary system is that there are five digits on either hand.

In the quinary place system, five numerals, from 0 to 4, are used to represent any real number. According to this method, five is written as 10, twenty-five is written as 100, and sixty is written as 220. 

As five is a prime number, only the reciprocals of the powers of five terminate, although its location between two highly composite numbers (4 and 6) guarantees that many recurring fractions have relatively short periods.

==Comparison to other radices==


==Usage==
Many languages use quinary number systems, including Gumatj, Nunggubuyu, Kuurn Kopan Noot, Luiseño, and Saraveca. Gumatj has been reported to be a true &quot;5–25&quot; language, in which 25 is the higher group of 5. The Gumatj numerals are shown below:

However, Harald Hammarström reports that &quot;one would not usually use exact numbers for counting this high in this language and there is a certain likelihood that the system was extended this high only at the time of elicitation with one single speaker,&quot; pointing to the Biwat language as a similar case (previously attested as 5-20, but with one speaker recorded as making an innovation to turn it 5-25).

==Biquinary==

: &quot;In this section, the numerals are in decimal. For example, &quot;5&quot; means five, and &quot;10&quot; means ten.&quot;
A decimal system with two and five as a sub-bases is called biquinary and is found in Wolof and Khmer. Roman numerals are an early biquinary system. The numbers 1, 5, 10, and 50 are written as I, V, X, and L respectively. Seven is VII, and seventy is LXX. The full list of symbols is:

Note that these are not positional number systems. In theory, a number such as 73 could be written as IIIXXL (without ambiguity) and as LXXIII. To extend Roman numerals to beyond thousands, a vinculum (horizontal overline) was added, multiplying the letter value by a thousand, e.g. overlined M̅ was one million. There is also no sign for zero. But with the introduction of inversions like IV and IX, it was necessary to keep the order from most to least significant.

Many versions of the abacus, such as the suanpan and soroban, use a biquinary system to simulate a decimal system for ease of calculation. Urnfield culture numerals and some tally mark systems are also biquinary. Units of currencies are commonly partially or wholly biquinary.

Bi-quinary coded decimal is a variant of biquinary that was used on a number of early computers including Colossus and the IBM 650 to represent decimal numbers.

==Calculators and programming languages==
Few calculators support calculations in the quinary system, except for some Sharp models (including some of the EL-500W and EL-500X series, where it is named the &quot;pental system&quot;) since about 2005, as well as the open-source scientific calculator WP 34S.

<text>Early Edition is an American fantasy comedy-drama television series that aired on CBS from September 28, 1996, to May 27, 2000. Set in Chicago, Illinois, it follows the adventures of a man who mysteriously receives each &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; newspaper the day before it is actually published, and who uses this knowledge to prevent terrible events every day. Created by Ian Abrams, Patrick Q. Page, and Vik Rubenfeld, the series starred actor Kyle Chandler as Gary Hobson, and it featured many real Chicago locations over the course of the series&#x27; run.

The show was canceled on May 27, 2000, after 90 episodes were made, and it began airing in syndication on Fox Family Channel that same month. Fan conventions about the show were held for multiple years. CBS Home Entertainment released the first two seasons on the DVD format in the United States in 2008 and 2009.

== Plot summary ==
The show chronicles the life of Gary Hobson, a resident of Chicago, Illinois, who mysteriously receives the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; newspaper a day in advance, effectively giving him knowledge of the potential future. His newspaper is delivered by a mysteriously unknown entity at least once each day, and is accompanied by a ginger tabby cat, with the first copy arriving every morning at 6:30 a.m., no matter what his physical location is. Armed with knowledge of the future, he then tries to prevent tragedies described in &quot;tomorrow&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Sun-Times&quot; from occurring, thus changing the story text and headlines in the newspaper to reflect the outcome of his actions. Often, Gary does not wish to be saddled with the responsibility of performing these deeds. The paper presents him with many moral dilemmas where he must choose between helping different people in need of assistance.

The first season begins by showing Gary coming home from his job as a stockbroker, only to be thrown out of the house (and later divorced) for no apparent reason by his wife Marsha. Upon taking up residence in the Blackstone Hotel, Gary begins receiving a copy of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, accompanied by &quot;The Cat&quot;, every morning. Slowly, Gary realizes the paper&#x27;s contents reflect events that are to happen during that day, and confers with his co-workers and friends Chuck Fishman (a former fellow stock broker) and Marissa Clark (the blind former receptionist at the brokerage). After deciding to use his knowledge of the future only for &quot;good,&quot; Gary is soon consumed by trying to prevent tragedies and help people, leading him to quit his job. During the season, Chuck consistently tries to use &quot;The Paper&quot; to make money, while Gary develops a precarious relationship with police Detective Marion Zeke Crumb. By the season&#x27;s end, Gary has begun to uncover some of the mystery surrounding the paper, including confirmation that a man named Lucius Snow received the paper from the cat before him.

Season two continues Gary&#x27;s adventures with the paper and his friends. Detective Crumb sometimes joins Gary, Chuck, and Marissa after retiring from the police force. Gary is working part-time at McGinty&#x27;s as a bartender. Despite being closer to the paper, Crumb does not want to know how Gary gets his so-called &quot;hunches,&quot; and never learns of the paper. At the end of season two, Chuck (Fisher Stevens) leaves the show as a regular character, leading to some major changes in season three. 
Within the course of the series, Gary discovers that a few other people share his gift of receiving a prophetic newspaper. The only people who know about his gift besides Chuck and Marissa are his parents, Meredith Carson, and Erica and Henry Paget, a single mother and her son (Gary gives Erica a job at McGinty&#x27;s); several times he begins to tell a few people, such as his attorney, and various police officers (Episode 407/408, &quot;Fatal Edition&quot;), but ultimately changes his mind. On some occasions, he is given the ability to wake up in another time (such as in the early 20th century) to change the past. People who encounter Gary often strongly suspect (or know) that he has a secret, but do not know what it is, e.g. Crumb.
During the course of the series, it is never clearly stated where the paper comes from. In one episode, Gary meets the group of people apparently responsible for giving him (as well as others) the Paper. Nothing much is revealed about them except that they have some sort of supernatural abilities, such as being able to mysteriously appear at any location.

In season four, episode 20, &quot;Time&quot; (the series finale that aired a few episodes early), it is briefly explained why Gary started receiving the paper. Apparently, he was given the responsibility by Lucius Snow (the man who received the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; before Gary), after Snow saved Gary&#x27;s life when Gary was a child. The responsibility is represented by a pocket knife imprinted with the initials of the person next to receive the paper (Lucius gave Gary the red Swiss Army knife). The initials mysteriously change every time the current person decides on a new person to receive the responsibility. At the end of the same episode, Gary passes on the same pocket knife to a young girl named Lindsey Romick who had just lost her grandfather, and it is implied that Lindsey will begin receiving the paper when Gary is no longer able to carry on the responsibilities.

=== Supporting characters ===

Chuck was a foil to Gary, being a somewhat cynical, wisecracking realist in contrast to Gary&#x27;s growing idealism. In early episodes, Chuck seeks to parlay the advance knowledge provided by the newspaper into windfall profits (e.g., sports betting and stock-market &#x27;insider trading&#x27;). Over time, however, he begins to take a role in helping and backing up Gary as a problem-solver.

Marissa often was the voice of reasonable conscience, balancing Gary&#x27;s earnest idealism against Chuck&#x27;s skeptical realism. Chuck also did the voice over narration at the opening and closing scenes of the episodes in season one, but this role would diminish during season two, save for a few episodes. Instead a standard line was used during opening credits, and a closing narration remained in a few episodes, but as season three progressed there was no narration for either the opening or closing scenes, and the episodes &quot;Walk Don&#x27;t Run&quot; and &quot;Deadline&quot; had fictional &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; columnist Molly Greene do the closing narration as part of her column.

Stevens&#x27;s departure from the show after two seasons changed the dynamic of the show. The device of his voice-over narration was shifted to at first Gary and then Marissa in season three. This was eventually done away with, the theme music was changed, and there began a revolving door of foils for Gary, including Patrick Quinn (Billie Worley) and Erica Paget (Kristy Swanson). The latter had a romantic subplot with Gary. Stevens made several guest appearances on the show after leaving, and several of the characters stayed (such as the hard-boiled detective Crumb, and Gary&#x27;s bartender Patrick).

===Guest stars===
During the series&#x27; run, &quot;Early Edition&quot; also featured many notable guest stars from television, feature films, and other entertainment industries.

Notable TV actors who appeared include Anna Chlumsky, Fyvush Finkel, Felicity Huffman, Ken Jenkins, Jane Krakowski, Laura Leighton, Robert Duncan McNeil, Cynthia Nixon, Pauley Perrette, Robert Picardo and Michael Shannon.

Academy Award winner Louis Gossett, Jr had a major role in the season two episode &quot;The Medal&quot;.

Former &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; publisher David Radler appeared several times as the publisher of the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;, the newspaper that was delivered to Gary, while movie reviewer Roger Ebert made a cameo as himself. Other cameos include Tara Lipinski, Coolio, Tone Loc, Dick Butkus, Pat O&#x27;Brien, and Martina McBride.

There was a season two cross-over with &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; with Héctor Elizondo, Jayne Brook and Rocky Carroll playing their characters from that show. Also during season three, CBS used an &quot;Early Edition&quot; episode as a promotional vehicle for the network&#x27;s &quot;Martial Law&quot; TV series starring martial arts expert Sammo Hung. In the fourth and final season, professional wrestlers Tommy Dreamer and New Jack guest starred in the episode &quot;Mel Schwartz, Bounty Hunter&quot;. A season two episode ended with a colorized clip of Rod Serling informing viewers they had just watched a tale from &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

==Production==

===Conception===
The origin of &quot;Early Edition&quot; stems from a collaborative idea between writers Vik Rubenfeld and Pat Page. After meeting each other while playing volleyball in Manhattan Beach, California, the pair began discussing ideas for feature films. While talking on the phone one day, they each contributed key parts for the idea of &quot;Early Edition&quot;. Rubenfeld believed the idea was more suited to television than a feature film, noting that, &quot;it was a really unique way to put a character in physical jeopardy each week.&quot; The duo proceeded to write a document that described the show&#x27;s characters and setting, and treatments for the first twelve episodes (a document known as a show&#x27;s &quot;bible&quot; in the TV industry). In the process they also created a detailed treatment for the pilot episode, which entitled them to &quot;Story By&quot; credit when the Pilot later aired.

Despite their idea, Rubenfeld and Page still faced the daunting task of finding a way to get the show on network television with limited television production and writing experience between them. Rubenfeld decided to pitch the show to Ian Abrams, who he knew through a group called the Professional Authors Group Enterprise (PAGE). Over lunch at RJ&#x27;s restaurant in Los Angeles, Rubenfeld and Page pitched the idea of &quot;a guy who gets tomorrow&#x27;s newspaper today.&quot; With Abrams&#x27;s help, they decided to try to convince Tristar to pick up the show, and went about adding a few ground rules for the story, such as having the paper always accompanied by a mysterious cat. In an effort to rouse Tristar&#x27;s interest in the show during their pitch meeting scheduled for August 24, 1995, Abrams had a mock newspaper created with the headline &quot;Let&#x27;s just let it end. O. J. Simpson confesses he is guilty of homicide.&quot; The catch to the mock newspaper was that it was dated the next day, August 25, 1995. After presenting the fake newspaper during the pitch meeting, a very lively conversation ensued, until someone realized the paper was dated the following day. &quot;Early Edition&quot; was green-lighted not long after.

Since its debut, the plot of &quot;Early Edition&quot; has been compared to other intellectual properties with similar themes. In particular, the 1944 feature film &quot;It Happened Tomorrow&quot; centered upon a newspaper reporter who received a newspaper a day in advance. However, &quot;Early Edition&quot;″s creators claim that &quot;Early Edition&quot; is in no way based on this film.

===Filming locations===
The series was filmed in Chicago and many nearby towns in Illinois and Indiana, with interior sets filmed on the Early Edition Sound Stage at Studio City in Chicago. Many famous Chicago locations are seen throughout the series, such as Navy Pier in the season three episode &quot;Play it Again, Sammo.&quot; The building used for exterior shots of McGinty&#x27;s bar, a location of central importance to the series, was formerly used by the Chicago Fire Department, and is located at the northeast corner of the intersection of Franklin Street and West Illinois Street in downtown Chicago. Additionally, Hobson lived in the Blackstone Hotel during the show&#x27;s first season.

===Music===
In the opening credits of each episode, the credit for composing &quot;Early Edition&#x27;s&quot; title theme music is given to W.G. Snuffy Walden, who later wrote the theme song to another hit TV show starring Kyle Chandler, &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;. During &quot;Early Edition&#x27;s&quot; original broadcast run in the United States, an edited version of the song &quot;Time Has Come Today&quot; by The Chambers Brothers was used during a revamped opening title sequence from episode 403 until the series&#x27; conclusion.

== Broadcast history ==
&quot;Early Edition&quot; premiered in the United States on CBS on September 28, 1996. A total of 90 episodes were produced over the course of the show&#x27;s four seasons, with the last original episode airing in the United States on May 27, 2000. Its original time slot was Saturday night at 9pm Eastern Standard Time, sandwiched between airings of &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot; and &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;. When &quot;Dr. Quinn&quot; ended in May 1998, &quot;Early Edition&quot; then began airing one hour earlier at 8 pm for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run. In January and February 2000, &quot;Early Edition&quot; went on temporary hiatus as the Dick Clark game show &quot;Winning Lines&quot; aired in its time slot.

<text>The Junkers G.38 was a large German four-engine transport aircraft that first flew in 1929. Two examples were constructed in Germany. Both aircraft flew as a commercial transport within Europe in the years leading up to World War II.

During the 1930s, the design was licensed to Mitsubishi, which constructed and flew a total of six aircraft, in a military bomber/transport configuration, designated Ki-20.

The G.38 carried a crew of seven. Onboard mechanics were able to service the engines in flight due to the G.38&#x27;s thick wing root, which provided access to all four power plants.

==Design and development==

During the 1920s, Hugo Junkers made several attempts to produce a large scale commercial transport. His initial attempt, the four-engined JG1, was developed during 1921-1922; but Junkers was forced to destroy the incomplete airplane based on post-World War I Allied demands citing the Treaty of Versailles. Later in the decade, in 1925, he published design specifications for a proposed eighty passenger trans-Atlantic aircraft - the J.1000 project. Then again, towards the end of the decade, the G.40 project was started by the Junkers design team as a trans-Atlantic mail plane. From the G.40 design, which was a seaplane configuration, Junkers also developed a landplane design, designated the G.38. Despite interest from the German armed forces in the G.40 variant, Junkers pushed forward with the landplane design, which, having received financing from the Reich Air Ministry (Reichsluftfahrtministerium), was taken forward to the construction stage.

The first Junkers prototype—3301 and marked as D-2000—first flew on 6 November 1929 with four gasoline engines: two Junkers L55 V-12 engines and two 294 kW L8 inline-6 engines, with a total power rating of 1470 kW (1971 hp). The Reich Air Ministry purchased the D-2000 for demonstration flights, and took delivery on 27 March 1930. In flight tests, the G.38 set four world records including speed, distance and duration for airplanes lifting a 5000 kg payload. On 2 May 1930 Luft Hansa put the D-2000 into commercial service for both scheduled and chartered flights.

Structurally the G.38 conformed to standard Junkers&#x27; practice, with a multi-tubular spar cantilever wing covered (like the rest of the aircraft) in stressed, corrugated duraluminium. The biplane tail, found in other large aircraft of the time, was intended to reduce rudder forces; initially there were three rudders with only a central fixed fin. The undercarriage was fixed, with double tandem main wheels that were initially enclosed in very large spats. The wing had the usual Junkers &quot;double wing&quot; form, the name referring to the full span movable flaps which served also as ailerons in the outer part.
On 2 February 1931 the Leipzig-based Junkers&#x27; yard refitted the D-2000 with two Junkers L8 and two L88 engines, giving a total power rating of 1764 kW (2366 hp) and increasing passenger capacity from 13 to 19.

During its early life the G.38 was the largest landplane in the world. Passenger accommodation was sumptuous by today&#x27;s standards and was meant to rival that found on the competing Zeppelin service offered by DELAG. The plane was unique in that passengers were seated in the wings, which were 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in) thick at the root. There were also two seats in the extreme nose. The leading edge of each wing was fitted with sloping windscreens giving these passengers the forward-facing view usually available only to pilots. There were three 11-seat cabins, plus smoking cabins and washrooms.

==Operational history==
On 1 July 1931 Luft Hansa initiated regularly scheduled service between Berlin and London on flights carrying up to 13 passengers. This London-Berlin service was halted in October 1931 to retrofit the aircraft and expand the passenger cabin of the D-2000. Construction lasted from this time until mid-1932, during which a second deck was built within the D-2000&#x27;s fuselage—enabling an increased cargo capacity and seating for up to 30 passengers. Additionally the D-2000&#x27;s engines were again upgraded to four L88s, giving a total power of 2352 kW (3154 hp). Also at this time the D-2000&#x27;s registration was changed to D-AZUR.

Meanwhile, a second G.38—factory number 3302 and c/n D-2500, later changed to D-APIS—was built with a double deck fuselage and capacity for 34 passengers. Six passengers were carried, three per wing, in each leading edge, the remaining 22 on two levels in the fuselage. Luft Hansa used D-APIS on a scheduled service covering the cities Berlin, Hanover, Amsterdam, and London. This aircraft was named &quot;General Feldmarschall von Hindenburg&quot;.

In 1934 D-2000/D-AZUR had its engines upgraded, this time with Jumo 4 engines, giving a total power rating of 2208 kW (2960 hp).

Both planes were in service simultaneously until 1936, when D-AZUR crashed in Dessau during a post-maintenance test flight. Luft Hansa had to write off this aircraft due to the extensive damage, but test pilot, Wilhelm Zimmermann, survived the crash, and there were no other casualties.

The second G.38—marked D-2500 and later D-APIS—flew successfully within the &quot;Deutsche Luft Hansa&quot; fleet for nearly a decade. With the outbreak of World War II the D-2500/D-APIS was pressed into military service as a transport craft by the Luftwaffe. It was destroyed on the ground during an RAF air raid on Athens on 17 May 1941.

<doc id="486154" wikidata="Q717249" url="?curid=486154" title="Tanaka Memorial">
<text>The is an alleged Japanese strategic planning document from 1927 in which Prime Minister Baron Tanaka Giichi laid out a strategy to take over the world for Emperor Hirohito. The authenticity of the document was long accepted and it is still quoted in some Chinese textbooks, but historian John Dower states that &quot;most scholars now agree that it was a masterful anti-Japanese hoax.&quot;

==Background==
The &quot;Tanaka Memorial&quot; was first published in the December 1929 edition of the Chinese publication &quot;時事月報&quot; (&quot;Current Affairs Monthly&quot;) in Nanking, a Nationalist Chinese publication. It was reproduced on 24 September 1931 on pp. 923–34 of &quot;China Critic&quot;, an English publication in Shanghai. The memorial contains the assertions:

The English translation of this document was in circulation before February 1934, and formed the foundation of the lead article on the front page of the first edition of &quot;The Plain Truth&quot; magazine published by Herbert W. Armstrong in February of that year, although it had first appeared in the less widely circulated &quot;Communist International&quot; magazine in 1931.

The &quot;Tanaka Memorial&quot; was depicted extensively by United States wartime propaganda as a sort of Japanese counterpart to &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. The installments &quot;The Battle of China&quot; and &quot;Prelude to War&quot; of Frank Capra&#x27;s Academy Award-winning movie series &quot;Why We Fight&quot; describe the &quot;Tanaka Memorial&quot; as the document that was the Japanese plan for war with the United States. The &quot;Tanaka Memorial&quot; was depicted the same way in &quot;Know Your Enemy: Japan&quot;, also directed by Capra during the war. As presented in these movies, the five sequential steps to achieve Japan&#x27;s goal of conquests are:

#Conquest of Manchuria
#Conquest of China
#Conquest of the Soviet Union or Siberia
#Establishment of bases in the Pacific
#Conquest of the United States

Its authenticity is not accepted by scholars today, but the &quot;Tanaka Memorial&quot; was widely accepted as authentic in the 1930s and 1940s because Japan&#x27;s actions appeared to correspond with these plans. The authenticity seemed to be confirmed by the 1931 Mukden Incident, 1937 Second Sino-Japanese War, 1939 Battles of Khalkhin Gol, 1940 Japanese invasion of French Indochina, the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, and the subsequent Pacific War. Historian Barak Kushner states:
:There were several critical historical mistakes in the Tanaka Memorial that clearly demonstrate it a fake, but the fact that the message overlapped with Japan&#x27;s general aims to militarily subdue China coincided with the belief elsewhere that the Memorial was genuine.

In 1940, Leon Trotsky published an account of how the document allegedly came to light. Soviet intelligence had obtained it from a high-placed mole in Tokyo but did not want to compromise their own security by publishing it openly, so they had leaked it through contacts that they had in the United States.
Journalist and popular historian Edwin P. Hoyt wrote that the Tanaka Memorial was an accurate representation &quot;of what Prime Minister Tanaka had said and what the supernationalists had been saying for months.&quot; Iris Chang adds that the Japanese government at that time was so faction-ridden that it would have been impossible to carry out such a plan in any case. Historian Meirion Harries wrote that the Tanaka Memorial &quot;was one of the most successful &#x27;dirty tricks&#x27; of the twentieth century – a bogus document so brilliantly conceived that thirty years later Westerners were still taken in by it&quot;. Likewise, historian William G. Beasley states that &quot;the nature of this document, as published variously in English and Chinese, does not carry conviction as to its authenticity&quot;. Dr. Haruo Tohmatsu, Professor of Diplomacy and War History of International Relations at the National Defense Academy of Japan, states that &quot;The &#x27;Tanaka Memorial&#x27; never existed, but the Dalian conference of that year adopted resolutions that reflected these ideas.&quot;

==Speculation of forgery==
In the summer of 1927 (June 27 – July 7), Tanaka convened a &quot;Far East Conference&quot; with members of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Army Ministry, Navy Ministry, and Finance Ministry. However, instead of ending with the production of a master plan for world domination, the Conference ended with a rough consensus that Japan should support the Kuomintang government of China in its war against the Chinese Communists, as long as the Japanese could convince General Zhang Zuolin to consolidate his base into a virtually autonomous Manchuria, which would serve as a buffer state, and eventually would fall under Japanese domination. It is alleged that the Tanaka Memorial is a secret report of this Conference.

When the Allies searched for incriminating documents to support war crime charges following the surrender of Japan, no drafts or copies of anything which corresponded to the &quot;Tanaka Memorial&quot; appeared among them; a Japanese language &quot;original&quot; has never been produced despite extensive research efforts.

The origin of the Memorial is still in question. Because the initial edition of the Memorial was written in Chinese, some Japanese historians have attributed it to Chinese sources, probably either Chinese Nationalists or Chinese Communists.

According to some claims, the document was forged by the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union forged the document in an attempt to trigger a war between China and Japan, a war which the Soviet Union would exploit in the service of its interests. The two theories are not mutually exclusive, as the Chinese Communist Party was a member of the Comintern under control of the Soviet Union, and Soviet policy from the 1930s was to wage a propaganda war against Japanese expansionism. Also, the first translation of the Memorial into English was done by the Communist Party USA and published in the December 1931 issue of &quot;Communist International&quot; magazine. It was later re-printed in book format.

In 1939, Peter Fleming claimed that he had produced an &quot;update&quot; to the &quot;Tanaka Memorial&quot;, by writing an imaginary report about a secret Allied strategy conference which was attended by the Kuomintang&#x27;s leader Chiang Kai-shek, and leaking it to the Japanese. This event proves that the British knew that the Tanaka Memorial was a forgery prior to World War II.

While the &quot;Tanaka Memorial&quot; is frequently treated as if it is a real document in newspapers and school textbooks which are published in China, most western historians have reached a consensus that the document is a forgery.

<doc id="486161" wikidata="Q6610273" url="?curid=486161" title="List of closed railway stations in Melbourne">
<text>A number of railway lines and stations which formed part of the greater Melbourne railway network have been closed over time, either in part or in full. The decision to close a railway station has historically been made by the department responsible for rail transport within the Government of Victoria.

Over the history of the Melbourne railway network, a total of eleven complete railway lines, as well as 71 railway stations, have been closed. The most recent railway stations to close are Surrey Hills and Mont Albert stations, which closed on 17 February 2023, due to the level crossing removal project which will see the two stations merge and become Union station, while the most recent railway line to close to traffic is the Port Melbourne railway line, which was closed on 11 October 1987, and was subsequently converted to light rail. A number of stations have also been closed and rebuilt at another location, such as West Footscray, which was rebuilt 160 metres away as part of the Regional Rail Link project.

Most closed railway lines have been converted to other uses, such as rail trails or linear parkland. In addition, a number of closed railway stations have been converted for other uses, such as retail stores.

==Closed railway lines==

==Stations==

===Closed===
===Rebuilt===

These stations previously existed in slightly different locations, and/or at a higher or lower level (for example, originally at ground level then lowered into a cutting), to their modern-day counterparts. They may be considered the closed predecessors of today&#x27;s stations.

*Ardeer (August 1956) – on the Melton line (greater metropolitan line)
*Boronia (1998) – on the Belgrave line; track lowered station rebuilt (with a significantly larger capacity than before the rebuild) lowered as part of grade separation under the intersection of Dorset/Boronia Roads. Surface areas and carpark now integrated with Boronia Junction Shopping Centre.
*Bentleigh (11 June – 29 August 2016) – on the Frankston line; rebuilt as part of the level crossing removal works at North Road, McKinnon Road and Centre Road.
*Box Hill (1983–1985) – on the Belgrave/Lilydale line; track lowered and station incorporated into Box Hill Central shopping centre.
*Canterbury (19 June 1966) – on the Belgrave/Lilydale line; current high level station opened on 15 September 1968 and was completed and the Canterbury Road level crossing closed on 22 December 1968
*Dandenong – Built 8 October 1887, upgraded in 1994–1995 – Change over for the Pakenham and Cranbourne Lines
*Elsternwick (October 1960) – on the Sandringham line; grade separated to remove the level crossing and tram square at Glen Huntly Road.
*Epping (29 November 1959) – terminus of the Epping line until 2012; current station opened on 30 November 1964
*Fawkner (13 July 1903) – on the Upfield line; current station opened on 10 December 1906
*Footscray 1900 – two separate stations for the Williamstown and Sunbury lines were merged into the current site
* Flinders Street
** Originally Melbourne Terminus (built 1854)
** Current Flinders Street station (built 1910)
*Gardiner (18 January 2016) – lowered into cutting as part of the removal of a Glen Waverley line rail crossing at Burke Road.
*Glen Waverley (24 February 1964) – terminus of the Glen Waverley line
*Heatherdale (2015 - 6 February 2017) track lowered into cutting and station rebuilt as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project.
*Hoppers Crossing (1983) – Originally located on the Western Side of Old Geelong Road (1970–1983) for country trains, rebuilt with longer platforms to cater for Electric Trains on the Eastern Side of Old Geelong Road.
*Laburnum (January 2007) – on the Belgrave/Lilydale line; track lowered to create a rail underpass replacing the level crossing at Middleborough Road.
*Lalor (5 August 1952) – on the Mernda line
*McKinnon (25 March – 1 August 2016) – on the Frankston Line; rebuilt as part of the level crossing removal works at North Road, McKinnon Road and Centre Road.
*Mitcham (25 December 1882 – 2 January 2014) – on the Belgrave/Lilydale line; track lowered to create a rail underpass replacing two level crossings at Mitcham Road and Rooks Road. New station opened 25 January 2014.
*Moorabbin 1959 – on the Frankston line; new station lowered below road level and provision made for the third track (which did not occur for some 20 years), road underpasses established for South Road and the Nepean Highway
*Mornington (1987) – on the Mornington line; new station located on the demolished Stopping Place 16 station and opened 2000
*Narre Warren (3 June 1995) – on the Pakenham line

**Swan Street low level (12 December 1859 – 1885)
**Richmond high level (1885 – 26 March 1960) – the opening of this station overlapped with the closure of Swan Street
*Sandown Park (16 May 1955) – on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines; current station opened on 19 June 1965
*Southern Cross, the main terminus of regional and interstate services in Victoria.
** Progressively expanded until 1960.
** Rebuilt station building and platform layout beginning in 1960 as part of the works providing a standard-gauge railway link to Sydney.
** Beginning 2002, Spencer Street has been substantially rebuilt and renamed Southern Cross. While maintaining the previous platform layout, the station bears no resemblance to the former station.
*Tottenham low level (27 July 1982) – on the Sunbury line
*Watergardens (Sydenham) (2002) – on the Sydenham line
*Watsonia was lowered into a cutting when the line between Macleod and Greensborough was duplicated. (Hurstbridge line)

<doc id="486164" wikidata="Q33942" url="?curid=486164" title="Pama–Nyungan languages">
<text>The Pama–Nyungan languages are the most widespread family of Australian Aboriginal languages, containing 306 out of 400 Aboriginal languages in Australia. The name &quot;Pama–Nyungan&quot; is a merism: it is derived from the two end-points of the range, the Pama languages of northeast Australia (where the word for &quot;man&quot; is ) and the Nyungan languages of southwest Australia (where the word for &quot;man&quot; is ).

The other language families indigenous to the continent of Australia are often referred to, by exclusion, as non-Pama–Nyungan languages, though this is not a taxonomic term. The Pama–Nyungan family accounts for most of the geographic spread, most of the Aboriginal population, and the greatest number of languages. Most of the Pama–Nyungan languages are spoken by small ethnic groups of hundreds of speakers or fewer. Many languages have become extinct, and almost all remaining ones are endangered in some way. Only in the central inland portions of the continent do Pama–Nyungan languages remain spoken vigorously by the entire community.

The first descriptions of languages from this family date to missionary grammars from the early 19th century, but the Pama–Nyungan family itself was identified and named only by Kenneth L. Hale, in his work on the classification of Native Australian languages. Hale&#x27;s research led him to the conclusion that of the Aboriginal Australian languages, one relatively closely interrelated family had spread and proliferated over most of the continent, while approximately a dozen other families were concentrated along the North coast.

==Typology==
Evans and McConvell describe typical Pama–Nyungan languages such as Warlpiri as dependent-marking and exclusively suffixing languages which lack gender, while noting that some non-Pama–Nyungan languages such as Tangkic share this typology and some Pama–Nyungan languages like Yanyuwa, a head-marking and prefixing language with a complicated gender system, diverge from it.

==Reconstruction==
Proto-Pama–Nyungan may have been spoken as recently as about 5,000 years ago, much more recently than the 40,000 to 60,000 years indigenous Australians are believed to have been inhabiting Australia. How the Pama–Nyungan languages spread over most of the continent and displaced any pre-Pama–Nyungan languages is uncertain; one possibility is that language could have been transferred from one group to another alongside culture and ritual. Given the relationship of cognates between groups, it seems that Pama–Nyungan has many of the characteristics of a sprachbund, indicating the antiquity of multiple waves of culture contact between groups. Dixon in particular has argued that the genealogical trees found with many language families do not fit in the Pama–Nyungan family.

Using computational phylogenetics, posit a mid-Holocene expansion of Pama–Nyungan from the Gulf Plains of northeastern Australia.

==Phonotactics==
Pama–Nyungan languages generally share several broad phonotactic constraints: single-consonant onsets, a lack of fricatives, and a prohibition against liquids (laterals and rhotics) beginning words. Voiced fricatives have developed in several scattered languages, such as Anguthimri, though often the sole alleged fricative is and is analysed as an approximant by other linguists. An exception is Kala Lagaw Ya, which acquired both fricatives and a voicing contrast in them and in its plosives from contact with Papuan languages. Several of the languages of Victoria allowed initial , and one—Gunai—also allowed initial and consonant clusters and , a trait shared with the extinct Tasmanian languages across the Bass Strait.

==Classification==

At the time of the European arrival in Australia, there were some 300 Pama–Nyungan languages divided across three dozen branches. What follows are the languages listed in and ; numbers in parentheses are the numbers of languages in each branch. These vary from languages so distinct they are difficult to demonstrate as being in the same branch, to near-dialects on par with the differences between the Scandinavian languages.

===Traditional conservative classification===
Down the east coast, from Cape York to the Bass Strait, there are:
*&quot;Kala Lagaw Ya&quot; (1)
*Paman (41)
*&quot;Yidiny&quot; (1)
*Dyirbalic (5)
*Maric (26)
*Waka–Kabic (5)
*Durubulic (5)
*Bandjalangic (4)
*Gumbaynggiric (2)
*&quot;Anewan&quot; (Nganyaywana) (1)
*Wiradhuric (Central NSW; inland of Yuin–Kuric) (5)
*Yuin–Kuric (14)
*Gippsland (5)

Continuing along the south coast, from Melbourne to Perth:
*Yotayotic (somewhat inland) (2)
*Kulinic (13)
*Lower Murray (9)
*Thura-Yura (8)
*Mirniny (2)
*Nyungic (SW) (11)

Up the west coast:
*Kartu (5)
*Kanyara–Mantharta (8)
*Ngayarta (12)
*Marrngu (3)

Cutting inland back to Paman, south of the northern non-Pama–Nyungan languages, are
*Ngumpin–Yapa (10)
*&quot;Warumungu&quot; (1)
*Warluwaric (5)
*Kalkatungic (2)
*Mayi (Mayabic) (7)

Encircled by these branches are:
*Wati (15), the large inland expanse in the west
*Arandic (9), in the north centre
*Karnic (18), in the west
*Yardli (Yarli) (3), in the west
*&quot;Muruwari&quot; (1)
*&quot;Baagandji&quot; (Darling; inland of Lower Murray) (2)

Separated to the north of the rest of Pama–Nyungan is
*Yolŋu (10)

Some of inclusions in each branch are only provisional, as many languages became extinct before they could be adequately documented. Not included are dozens of poorly attested and extinct languages such as &quot;Barranbinja&quot; and the &quot;Lower Burdekin languages&quot;.

A few more inclusive groups that have been proposed, such as &quot;Northeast Pama–Nyungan&quot; (Pama–Maric), &quot;Central New South Wales&quot;, and &quot;Southwest Pama–Nyungan&quot;, appear to be geographical rather than genealogical groups.

===External relations===
According to Nicholas Evans, the closest relative of Pama–Nyungan is the Garawan language family, followed by the small Tangkic family. He then proposes a more distant relationship with the Gunwinyguan languages in a macro-family he calls Macro-Pama–Nyungan. However, this has yet to be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the linguistic community.

==Validity==

===Dixon&#x27;s scepticism===
In his 1980 attempt to reconstruct Proto-Australian, R. M. W. Dixon reported that he was unable to find anything that reliably set Pama–Nyungan apart as a valid genetic group. Fifteen years later, he had abandoned the idea that Australian or Pama–Nyungan were families. He now sees Australian as a Sprachbund . Some of the small traditionally Pama–Nyungan families which have been demonstrated through the comparative method, or which in Dixon&#x27;s opinion are likely to be demonstrable, include the following:

*North Cape York (Northern Paman, Umpila, Wik/Middle Paman: part of Paman)
*Yidinic (Dyaabugai and Yidiny: rejected by Bowern)
*Maric (extinct languages uncertain)
*Wiradhuric
*Yolngu
*Ngarna, a clear connection between Yanyuwa and Warluwara, Wagaya, Yindjilandji, Bularnu.
*Part of Yura

He believes that Lower Murray (five families and isolates), Arandic (2 families, Kaytetye and Arrernte), and Kalkatungic (2 isolates) are small &quot;Sprachbunds&quot;.

Dixon&#x27;s theories of Australian language diachrony have been based on a model of punctuated equilibrium (adapted from the eponymous model in evolutionary biology) wherein he believes Australian languages to be ancient and to have—for the most part—remained in unchanging equilibrium with the exception of sporadic branching or speciation events in the phylogenetic tree. Part of Dixon&#x27;s objections to the Pama–Nyungan family classification is the lack of obvious binary branching points which are implicitly or explicitly entailed by his model.

===Mainstream rejoinders===
However, the papers in demonstrate about ten traditional groups, including Pama–Nyungan, and its sub-branches such as Arandic, using the comparative method.

In his last published paper from the same collection, Ken Hale describes Dixon&#x27;s scepticism as an erroneous phylogenetic assessment which is &quot;so bizarrely faulted, and such an insult to the eminently successful practitioners of Comparative Method Linguistics in Australia, that it positively demands a decisive riposte.&quot; In the same work Hale provides unique pronominal and grammatical evidence (with suppletion) as well as more than fifty basic-vocabulary cognates (showing regular sound correspondences) between the Proto-Northern-and-Middle Pamic (pNMP) family of the Cape York Peninsula on the Australian northeast coast and Proto-Ngayarta of the Australian west coast, some 3,000 km apart (as well as from many other languages), to support the Pama–Nyungan grouping, whose age he compares to that of Proto-Indo-European.

====Bowern (2006)====
Bowern offered an alternative to Dixon&#x27;s binary phylogenetic-tree model based in the principles of dialect geography. Rather than discarding the notion that multiple subgroups of languages are genetically related due to the presence of multiple dialectal epicentres arranged around stark isoglosses, Bowern proposed that the non-binary-branching characteristics of Pama–Nyungan languages are precisely what we would expect to see from a language continuum in which dialects are diverging linguistically but remaining in close geographic and social contact. Bowern offered three main advantages of this geographical-continuum model over the punctuated equilibrium model:
====Bowern &amp; Atkinson (2012)====
Additional methods of computational phylogenetics employed by Bowern and Atkinson uncovered that there were more binary-branching characteristics than initially thought. Instead of acceding to the notion that Pama–Nyungan languages do not share the characteristics of a binary-branching language family, the computational methods revealed that inter-language loan rates were not as atypically high as previously imagined and do not obscure the features that would allow for a phylogenetic approach. This finding functioned as a kind of rejoinder to Dixon&#x27;s scepticism.

Bowern and Atkinson&#x27;s computational model is currently the definitive model of Pama–Nyungan intra-relatedness and diachrony.

<doc id="486166" wikidata="Q354699" url="?curid=486166" title="Foveon X3 sensor">
<text>The Foveon X3 sensor is a digital camera image sensor designed by Foveon, Inc., (now part of Sigma Corporation) and manufactured by Dongbu Electronics. 
It uses an array of photosites that consist of three vertically stacked photodiodes. Each of the three stacked photodiodes has a different spectral sensitivity, allowing it to respond differently to different wavelengths. The signals from the three photodiodes are then processed as additive color data that are transformed to a standard RGB color space. In the late 1970s, a similar color sensor having three stacked photo detectors at each pixel location, with different spectral responses due to the differential absorption of light by the semiconductor, had been developed and patented by Kodak. 

The X3 sensor technology was first deployed in 2002 in the Sigma SD9 DSLR camera, and subsequently in the SD10, SD14, SD15, SD1 (including SD1 Merrill), the original mirrorless compact Sigma DP1 and Sigma DP2 in 2008 and 2009 respectively, the Sigma dp2 Quattro series from 2014, and the Sigma SD Quattro series from 2016. The development of the Foveon X3 technology is the subject of the 2005 book &quot;The Silicon Eye&quot; by George Gilder.

==Operation==
The diagram to the right depicts how the Foveon X3 sensor works. The image on the left shows the absorption of colors for each wavelength as it passes through the silicon wafer. The image on the right shows a layered sensor stack depicting the colors it detects at each absorption level for each output pixel. The sensor colors shown are only examples. In practice, the color attributes of each output pixel using this sensor result from the camera&#x27;s image processing algorithms, which use a matrix process to construct a single RGB color from all the data sensed by the photodiode stack.

The depth of the silicon wafer in each of the three sensors is less than five micrometers that creates a negligible effect on focusing or chromatic aberration. However, because the collection depth of the deepest sensor layer (red) is comparable to collection depths in other silicon CMOS and CCD sensors, some diffusion of electrons and loss of sharpness in the longer wavelengths occurs.

==Use==
The first digital camera to use a Foveon X3 sensor was the Sigma SD9, a digital SLR launched in 2002. It used a 20.7 × 13.8 mm, 2268 x 1512 × 3 (3.54 × 3 MP) iteration of the sensor and was built on a Sigma-designed body using the Sigma SA mount. The camera was followed in 2003 by the improved but technically similar Sigma SD10, which was in turn succeeded in 2006 by the Sigma SD14, which used a higher-resolution, 2640 × 1760 × 3 (4.64 × 3 MP) sensor. The SD14&#x27;s successor, the Sigma SD15, was released in June 2010 and used the same 2640 × 1760 × 3 sensor as the SD14. The Sigma SD1 was released in June 2011 with a new 23.5×15.7mm APS-C 4800 × 3200 × 3 (15.36 × 3 MP) sensor developed for the professional market.

In 2004, Polaroid Corporation announced the Polaroid x530, a compact camera with a 1408 × 1056 × 3, 1/1.8-in. sensor. The camera had a limited release in 2005 but was recalled later in the year for unspecified image quality problems. Sigma announced a prototype of its Foveon-based compact camera in 2006, the Sigma DP1, using the same 14 MP sensor as the SD14 DSLR. A revised version of the prototype was exhibited in 2007, and the camera was eventually launched in spring 2008. Unlike the Polaroid x530, the DP1 had an APS-C-sized sensor with a 28mm equivalent prime lens. The camera was revised as the DP1s and the DP1x. In 2009, the company launched the DP2, a compact camera using the same sensor and body as the DP1 but with a 41 mm-equivalent f/2.8 lens.

==Comparison to Bayer-filter sensors==
The operation of the Foveon X3 sensor is different from that of the Bayer filter image sensor, which is more commonly used in digital cameras. In the Bayer sensor, each photosite in the array consists of a single light sensor (either CMOS or CCD) that, as a result of filtration, is exposed to only one of the three colors detectable on the sensor: red, green, or blue. Constructing a full-color image from a Bayer sensor requires demosaicing, an interpolative process in which the output pixel associated with each photosite is assigned an RGB value based in part on the level of red, green, and blue reported by those photosites adjacent to it. However, the Foveon X3 sensor creates its RGB color output for each photosite by combining the outputs of each of the stacked photodiodes at each of its photosites. This operational difference results in several significant consequences.

===Color artifacts===
Because demosaicing is not required for the Foveon X3 sensor to produce a full-color image, the color artifacts (&quot;colored jaggies&quot;) associated with the process are not seen. The separate anti-aliasing filter commonly used to mitigate those artifacts in a Bayer sensor is not required; this is because little aliasing occurs when the photodiodes for each color, with the assistance of the microlenses, integrate the optical image over a region almost as big as the spacing of sensors for that color. On the other hand, the method of color separation by silicon penetration depth gives more cross-contamination between color layers, meaning more issues with color accuracy.

===Light gathering and low-light performance===
Theoretically, the Foveon X3 photosensor can detect more photons entering the camera lens than a mosaic sensor, because each of the color filters overlaying each photosite of a mosaic sensor passes only one of the primary colors and absorbs the other two. However, the individual layers in a Foveon sensor do not respond as sharply to the respective colors; thus color-indicating information in the sensor&#x27;s raw data requires an &quot;aggressive&quot; matrix (i.e., the removal of common-mode signals) to produce color data in a standard color space, which can increase color noise in low-light situations.

===Spatial resolution===
According to Sigma Corporation, &quot;there has been some controversy in how to specify the number of pixels in Foveon sensors.&quot; The argument has been over whether sellers should count the number of photosites or the total number of photodiodes, as a megapixel count, and whether either of those should be compared with the number of photodiodes in a Bayer filter sensor or camera as a measure of resolution.

For example, the dimensions of the photosite array in the sensor in the Sigma SD10 camera are 2268 × 1512, and the camera produces a native file size of those dimensions (times three color layers), which amounts to approximately 3.4 million three-color pixels. However, it has been advertised as a 10.2 MP camera by taking into account that each photosite contains stacked red, green, and blue color-sensing photodiodes, or pixel sensors (2268 × 1512 × 3). By comparison, the dimensions of the photosite array in the 10.2 MP Bayer sensor in the Nikon D200 camera are 3872 × 2592, but there is only one photodiode, or one-pixel sensor, at each site. The cameras have equal numbers of photodiodes and produce similar raw data file sizes, but the Bayer filter camera produces a larger native file size via demosaicing.

The actual resolution produced by the Bayer sensor is more complicated than the count of its photosites, or its native file size might suggest; the demosaicing and the separate anti-aliasing filter are both commonly used to reduce the occurrence or severity of color moiré patterns that the mosaic characteristic of the Bayer sensor produces. The effect of this filter blurs the image output of the sensor which produces a lower resolution than the photosite count would seem to imply. This filter is mostly unnecessary with the Foveon X3 sensor and is not used. The earliest camera with a Foveon X3 sensor, the Sigma SD9, showed visible luminance moiré patterns without color moiré.

Subsequent X3-equipped cameras have less aliasing because they include micro-lenses, which provide an anti-aliasing filter by averaging the optical signal over an area commensurate with the sample density. This is not possible in any color channel of a Bayer-type sensor. Aliasing from the Foveon X3 sensor is &quot;far less bothersome because it&#x27;s monochrome,&quot; said Norman Koren. In theory, it is possible for a Foveon X3 sensor with the same number of photodiodes as a Bayer sensor and no separate anti-aliasing filter to attain a higher spatial resolution than that Bayer sensor. Independent tests indicate that the &quot;10.2 MP&quot; array of the Foveon X3 sensor (in the Sigma SD10) has a resolution similar to a 5 MP or 6 MP
Bayer sensor. At low ISO speed, it is even similar to a 7.2 MP Bayer sensor.

With the introduction of the Sigma SD14, the 14 MP (4.7 MP red + 4.7 MP green + 4.7 MP blue) Foveon X3 sensor resolution is compared favorably by reviewers to that of 10 MP Bayer sensors. For example, Mike Chaney of ddisoftware says &quot;the SD14 produces better photos than a typical 10 MP DSLR because it is able to carry sharp detail all the way to the &#x27;falloff&#x27; point at 1700 LPI, whereas contrast, color detail, and sharpness begin to degrade long before the 1700 LPI limit on a Bayer based 10 MP DSLR.&quot;

Another article judges the Foveon X3 sensor as roughly equivalent to a 9 MP Bayer sensor.

A visual comparison between a 14 MP Foveon sensor and a 12.3 MP Bayer sensor shows Foveon has crisper details.

===Noise===
The Foveon X3 sensor, as used in the Sigma SD10 camera, has been characterized by two independent reviewers as noisier than the sensors in some other DSLRs using the Bayer sensor at higher ISO film speed equivalents, chroma noise in particular. Another noted higher noise during long exposure times. However, these reviewers offer no opinion as to whether this is an inherent property of the sensor or the camera&#x27;s image-processing algorithms.

With regards to the Sigma SD14, which uses a more recent Foveon X3 sensor, one reviewer judged its noise levels as ranging from &quot;very low&quot; at ISO 100 to &quot;moderate&quot; at ISO 1600 when using the camera&#x27;s Raw image format.

===Sample images===
Sigma&#x27;s SD14 site has galleries of full-resolution images showing the color produced by the Foveon technology. The 14 MP Foveon chip produces 4.7 MP native-size RGB files; 14 MP Bayer filter cameras produce a 14 MP native file size by interpolation (i.e., demosaicing). Direct visual comparison of images from 12.7 MP Bayer sensors and 14.1 MP Foveon sensors show Bayer images are superior on fine monochrome detail, such as the lines between bricks on a distant building, but the Foveon images are superior in color resolution.

==Further development==
As of May 2023, the Foveon X3 sensor is less favoured by the average photographer, being overtaken by CMOS sensors which can be made at lower cost with higher resolution and lower noise. 

However it was reported in February 2021 that Sigma has been working on a new Foveon sensor but that a critical flaw was found in their development to date and they had to restart development from scratch.

In February 2022 it was reported that Sigma was in the second stage of prototyping the new full frame Foveon sensor. Second stage prototyping in this case is the evaluation of a small image sensor prototype with the same pixel size as the product specifications but with a reduced total pixel count to verify the performance characteristics of the image sensor in practice. Third stage prototyping will evaluate a full-frame image sensor with the same specifications as the mass production devices including the AD converter etc. It is unlikely that mass production will commence before 2024.

<doc id="486168" wikidata="Q1044376" url="?curid=486168" title="Solanum carolinense">
<text>Solanum carolinense, the Carolina horsenettle, is not a true nettle, but a member of the Solanaceae, or nightshade family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant, native to the southeastern United States, though its range has expanded throughout much of temperate North America. The plant is an invasive in parts of Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. The stem and undersides of larger leaf veins are covered with prickles.

&quot;Horsenettle&quot; is also written &quot;horse nettle&quot; or &quot;horse-nettle&quot;, though USDA publications usually use the one-word form. Though there are other horsenettle nightshades, &quot;S. carolinense&quot; is the species most commonly called &quot;&quot;the&quot; horsenettle&quot;. Other common names include radical weed, sand brier or briar, [[bull nettle]], tread-softly, [[Solanum mammosum]] (&quot;apple of Sodom&quot;), devil&#x27;s tomatoand[[wild tomato]]. 


==Description==
Leaves are alternate, elliptic-oblong to oval, long, and each is irregularly lobed or coarsely toothed. Both surfaces are covered with fine hairs. Leaves smell like potatoes when crushed. The flowers have five petals and are usually white or purple with yellow centers, though there is a blue variant that resembles the tomato flower. The fruits are berries that resemble tomatoes. The immature fruit is dark green with light green stripes, turning yellow and wrinkled as it matures. Each fruit contains around 60 seeds. It flowers throughout the summer, from April to October (on the northern hemisphere). The plant grows to tall, is perennial, and spreads by both seeds and underground rhizome. Stems of older plants are woody.

==Toxicity==
Many parts of the plant have historically been used to create medicines to treat various conditions. It was listed in the United States National Formulary from 1916 to 1936 for use by pharmacists. However all parts of the plant, including its tomato-like fruit, contain toxins in varying degrees due to the presence of solanine glycoalkaloids which is a toxic alkaloid and one of the plant&#x27;s natural defenses. While ingesting any part of the plant can cause fever, headache, scratchy throat, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, ingesting the fruit can cause abdominal pain, circulatory and respiratory depression, or even death.

==Ecology==

===Habitat===
These plants can be found growing in pastures, roadsides, railroad margins, and in disturbed areas and waste ground. They grow to about tall, but are typically shorter, existing as subshrubs. They prefer full sun, but can tolerate both wet or dry conditions. They grow readily in sandy or loamy soils, and may also tolerate a wide range of soil types. They are most vigorous and most likely to become weedy or dominate on disturbed sites, but can also be found in less disturbed habitats.

===Faunal associations and diseases===
Bumble bees pollinate the flowers of this species.

At least thirty-two insects, as well as the meadow vole &quot;Microtus pennsylvanicus&quot;, have been recorded feeding on this species in Virginia alone. The caterpillars of the &quot;Synanthedon rileyana&quot; moth and the &quot;Manduca sexta&quot; (tobacco hornworm) moth feed on the plant. &quot;Manduca sexta&quot; moths prefer inbred plants to outbred plants. The beetle &quot;Leptinotarsa juncta&quot; specializes on this plant, and the beetle &quot;Epitrix fuscula&quot; (eggplant flea beetle) eats it as well. These two beetles are its two primary herbivores, and can reduce fruit production by as much as 75% relative to plants protected from all insects. &quot;Anthonomus nigrinus&quot; feeds on the flowers, and &quot;Trichobaris trinotata&quot; bores into the stems. This plant is also eaten by &quot;Leptinotarsa decemlineata&quot; (the Colorado potato beetle) and has been recorded as being eaten at very low rates by pupae of an unidentified species of the family Gelechiidae.
Parasitic nematodes of the genus &quot;Pratylenchus&quot; have been found on lesions on its roots, however causing little damage. The fungus &quot;Rhizoctonia solani&quot; was found causing root rot, particularly under wet conditions in plants damaged by trampling. The plant is also affected by &quot;Erysiphe cichoracearum&quot;, causing powdery mildew.

Fruits are eaten by a variety of native animals, including ring-necked pheasant, bobwhite, wild turkey, and striped skunk. Most mammals avoid eating the stems and leaves due to both the spines and toxicity of the plant.

==Weed==
Carolina horsenettle is considered a noxious weed in one US state (Alaska). It can spread vegetatively by underground rhizomes as well as by seed. It is resistant to many postemergent herbicides and somewhat resistant to broad-spectrum herbicides such as glyphosate and 2,4-D. In fact, herbicide use often selects for horsenettle by removing competing weeds. It is an especially despised weed by gardeners who hand-weed, as the prickles tend to penetrate the skin and then break off when the plant is grasped. The deep root also makes it difficult to remove.

Christmas. Ever!&quot; (2023).

In television, Biggs is known for his lead roles as the voice of Leonardo in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2012–2014) and Larry Bloom in the Netflix original series &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; (2013–2014; 2017; 2019).

He had a supporting role on the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (1994–1995). He hosted the Blue Ribbon Baking Championship on Netflix (2024).

==Early life and education==
Jason Matthew Biggs was born on May 12, 1978, in Pompton Plains, New Jersey, to Angela (née Zocco), a nurse, and Gary Louis Biggs, a shipping company manager. His father is of English and Italian descent and his mother is of Sicilian descent. His last name is derived from his English ancestry. He was raised Roman Catholic.

Biggs grew up in Hasbrouck Heights and attended Hasbrouck Heights High School, where he achieved success in tennis. He attended New York University before transferring to Montclair State University, where he eventually dropped out.

==Career==

Biggs began acting at the age of five. In 1991, he made his television debut in the short-lived FOX series &quot;Drexell&#x27;s Class&quot;.

In 1988, aged 10, he received his Screen Actors Guild card for appearing in a TV commercial for Pathmark. He later recalled in a 2015 interview in &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;I remember I had to eat a doughnut in one of the shots. Over and over again. Awesome.&quot;

When Biggs was 12, he debuted on Broadway in &quot;Conversations with My Father&quot; with Judd Hirsch. He then starred in the daytime soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Best Younger Actor.

Biggs attended New York University briefly from 1996 to 1997, but soon afterwards, he left to pursue acting. And soon he would be seen again in another short lived television series, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Camp Stories&quot;. He starred in &quot;American Pie&quot;, which went on to become an international hit that has spawned three sequels (also starring Biggs) and four spinoffs (that did not star Biggs). He accepted starring roles in movies such as &quot;Loser&quot; in 2000, and others. He also starred (along with his &quot;Loser&quot; co-star Mena Suvari) in the music video for the song &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot; by American rock band Wheatus. In 2001, Biggs starred in the comedy &quot;Saving Silverman&quot;.

He appeared in the 2002 Broadway production of &quot;The Graduate&quot; as Benjamin Braddock alongside Kathleen Turner and Alicia Silverstone. In 2003, Biggs appeared as Jerry Falk in the Woody Allen romantic comedy &quot;Anything Else&quot;. In the 2004–2005 season, Biggs portrayed an Orthodox Jew in Daniel Goldfarb&#x27;s comedy, &quot;Modern Orthodox&quot;, staged at Dodger Stages theater in New York City. In 2006, Biggs was seen in the MTV reality show &quot;Blowin&#x27; Up&quot; with Jamie Kennedy and Stu Stone which led to his participation in a hip-hop recording with Bay Area rapper E-40. Biggs returned to the stage in the fall of 2008 in Howard Korder&#x27;s &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; at New York City&#x27;s Second Stage Theatre.

Biggs has appeared in several other films, including &quot;Eight Below&quot; and &quot;Over Her Dead Body&quot;. In 2010, Biggs made his literary debut by contributing &quot;Scratch-and-Sniff&quot;, a poem about growing up in New Jersey, to the anthology &quot;What&#x27;s Your Exit? A Literary Detour through New Jersey&quot; (Word Riot Press, 2010). In 2012, he contributed to the anthology &quot;Oy! Only Six? Why Not More: Six-Word Memoirs on Jewish Life&quot; with the self-ironic article &quot;This is a Roman nose, OK?&quot; (Biggs is not Jewish.) A year later, Larry Smith, the editor of the anthology, and creator of &quot;Six-Word Memoirs&quot;, would be the basis for Biggs&#x27;s &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; character Larry Bloom. He departed the series in February 2015 after two seasons.
Biggs reprised his role as Jim Levenstein in &quot;American Reunion&quot;, which was released on April 6, 2012. In the summer of 2012, Biggs took a job voicing Leonardo on Nickelodeon in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. He left the series during its second season and was temporarily replaced by Dominic Catrambone. Seth Green permanently took over the role from Biggs beginning in season 3, with Leonardo&#x27;s voice change being explained in the show&#x27;s universe, as it was due to his throat getting injured in a battle against Shredder. Biggs also plays the cowbell in the supergroup Yukon Kornelius.

It was announced in September 2014, that Biggs would star on Broadway in &quot;The Heidi Chronicles&quot;. The play opened on March 19.

In December 2014, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced Biggs was cast to star in the comedy &quot;Amateur Night&quot;. Biggs plays a well-meaning expectant father who unwittingly accepts a job chauffeuring prostitutes (Janet Montgomery, Ashley Tisdale) around Los Angeles. Jenny Mollen, who is Biggs&#x27; wife in real life, appears as his wife in the film.

In 2023, Biggs starred as Rob Sanders in the Netflix Christmas-themed film &quot;Best. Christmas. Ever.&quot; alongside Brandy, Heather Graham and Matt Cedeño.

==Personal life==
Biggs grew up Catholic.

In January 2008, he became engaged to his &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Girl&quot; co-star, actress Jenny Mollen; they married on April 23, 2008. They have a son who was born on February 15, 2014. A second son was born on October 2, 2017. Biggs and Mollen sold their house in Los Angeles, California, which was situated near the Sunset Strip, in 2015 and moved to Manhattan, New York City. The family resides in the West Village, as of 2017.

From 2012 to 2014, Biggs regularly caused controversy with his posts on Twitter, including sexual jokes about Ann Romney and Janna Ryan in response to the 2012 Republican National Convention, joking about the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in 2014, joking about Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down later that year, and mocking the death of &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; contestant Eric Hill. In a 2012 interview, Biggs stated that he has &quot;a very fucked up sense of humor&quot; and said he enjoyed the ability to &quot;surprise people on a daily basis&quot; on Twitter because his real personality is so different from those of the characters he usually plays. He apologized for and deleted his tweet about Malaysian Flight 17; in a later interview he said that it had led to death threats against him.

In 2023, Biggs and his wife Mollen both signed the &quot;No Hostage Left Behind Letter&quot;, an open letter to US President Joe Biden calling for the release of all hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the October 7 attack on Israel.

<text>L&#x27;Orfeo (SV 318) (), or La favola d&#x27;Orfeo , is a late Renaissance/early Baroque &quot;favola in musica&quot;, or opera, by Claudio Monteverdi, with a libretto by Alessandro Striggio. It is based on the Greek legend of Orpheus, and tells the story of his descent to Hades and his fruitless attempt to bring his dead bride Eurydice back to the living world. It was written in 1607 for a court performance during the annual Carnival at Mantua. While Jacopo Peri&#x27;s &quot;Dafne&quot; is generally recognised as the first work in the opera genre, and the earliest surviving opera is Peri&#x27;s &quot;Euridice&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; is the earliest that is still regularly performed.

By the early 17th century the traditional intermedio—a musical sequence between the acts of a straight play—was evolving into the form of a complete musical drama or &quot;opera&quot;. Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; moved this process out of its experimental era and provided the first fully developed example of the new genre. After its initial performance the work was staged again in Mantua, and possibly in other Italian centres in the next few years. Its score was published by Monteverdi in 1609 and again in 1615. After the composer&#x27;s death in 1643 the opera went unperformed for many years, and was largely forgotten until a revival of interest in the late 19th century led to a spate of modern editions and performances. At first these performances tended to be concert (unstaged) versions within institutes and music societies, but following the first modern dramatised performance in Paris, in 1911, the work began to be seen in theatres. After the Second World War many recordings were issued, and the opera was increasingly staged in opera houses, although some leading venues resisted it. In 2007, the quatercentenary of the premiere was celebrated by performances throughout the world.

In his published score Monteverdi lists around 41 instruments to be deployed, with distinct groups of instruments used to depict particular scenes and characters. Thus strings, harpsichords and recorders represent the pastoral fields of Thrace with their nymphs and shepherds, while heavy brass illustrates the underworld and its denizens. Composed at the point of transition from the Renaissance era to the Baroque, &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; employs all the resources then known within the art of music, with particularly daring use of polyphony. The work is not orchestrated as such; in the Renaissance tradition instrumentalists followed the composer&#x27;s general instructions but were given considerable freedom to improvise.

==Historical background==

Claudio Monteverdi, born in Cremona in 1567, was a musical prodigy who studied under Marc&#x27;Antonio Ingegneri, the&quot; maestro di cappella&quot; (head of music) at Cremona Cathedral. After training in singing, string playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as &quot;suonatore di vivuola&quot; (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga&#x27;s court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga&#x27;s &quot;maestro della musica&quot; (master of music) in 1601.

Vincenzo Gonzaga&#x27;s particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio—a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas—into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: &quot;Dafne&quot;, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—&quot;Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo&quot; by Emilio de&#x27; Cavalieri, Peri&#x27;s &quot;Euridice&quot; and Giulio Caccini&#x27;s identically titled &quot;Euridice&quot;—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;.

The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo&#x27;s time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano&#x27;s lyrical drama &quot;La favola di Orfeo&quot;, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court&#x27;s musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini&#x27;s play &quot;Il pastor fido&quot;, described by theatre historian Mark Ringer as a &quot;watershed theatrical work&quot; which inspired the Italian craze for pastoral drama. On 6 October 1600, while visiting Florence for the wedding of Maria de&#x27; Medici to King Henry IV of France, Duke Vincenzo attended the premiere of Peri&#x27;s &quot;Euridice&quot;. It is likely that his principal musicians, including Monteverdi, were also present at this performance. The Duke quickly recognised the novelty of this new form of dramatic entertainment, and its potential for bringing prestige to those prepared to sponsor it.

==Creation==

===Libretto===
Among those present at the &quot;Euridice&quot; performance in October 1600 was a young lawyer and career diplomat from Gonzaga&#x27;s court, Alessandro Striggio, son of a well-known composer of the same name. The younger Striggio was himself a talented musician; as a 16-year-old, he had played the viol at the wedding festivities of Duke Ferdinando of Tuscany in 1589. Together with Duke Vincent&#x27;s two young sons, Francesco and Fernandino, he was a member of Mantua&#x27;s exclusive intellectual society, the , which provided the chief outlet for the city&#x27;s theatrical works. It is not clear at what point Striggio began his libretto for &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, but work was evidently under way in January 1607. In a letter written on 5 January, Francesco Gonzaga asks his brother, then attached to the Florentine court, to obtain the services of a high quality castrato from the Grand Duke&#x27;s establishment, for a &quot;play in music&quot; being prepared for the Mantuan Carnival.

Striggio&#x27;s main sources for his libretto were Books 10 and 11 of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; and Book Four of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;. These provided him with the basic material, but not the structure for a staged drama; the events of acts 1 and 2 of the libretto are covered by a mere 13 lines in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. For help in creating a dramatic form, Striggio drew on other sources—Poliziano&#x27;s 1480 play, Guarini&#x27;s &quot;Il pastor fido&quot;, and Ottavio Rinuccini&#x27;s libretto for Peri&#x27;s &quot;Euridice&quot;. Musicologist Gary Tomlinson remarks on the many similarities between Striggio&#x27;s and Rinuccini&#x27;s texts, noting that some of the speeches in &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; &quot;correspond closely in content and even in locution to their counterparts in &quot;L&#x27;Euridice&quot;&quot;. The critic Barbara Russano Hanning writes that Striggio&#x27;s verses are less subtle than those of Rinuccini, although the structure of Striggio&#x27;s libretto is more interesting. Rinuccini, whose work had been written for the festivities accompanying a Medici wedding, was obliged to alter the myth to provide a &quot;happy ending&quot; suitable for the occasion. By contrast, because Striggio was not writing for a formal court celebration he could be more faithful to the spirit of the myth&#x27;s conclusion, in which Orfeo is killed and dismembered by deranged maenads or &quot;Bacchantes&quot;. He chose, in fact, to write a somewhat muted version of this bloody finale, in which the Bacchantes threaten Orfeo&#x27;s destruction but his actual fate is left in doubt.

The libretto was published in Mantua in 1607 to coincide with the premiere and incorporated Striggio&#x27;s ambiguous ending. However, Monteverdi&#x27;s score published in Venice in 1609 by Ricciardo Amadino shows an entirely different resolution, with Orpheus transported to the heavens through the intervention of Apollo. According to Ringer, Striggio&#x27;s original ending was almost certainly used at the opera&#x27;s premiere, but there is no doubt that Monteverdi believed the revised ending was aesthetically correct. The musicologist Nino Pirrotta argues that the Apollo ending was part of the original plan for the work, but was not staged at the premiere because the small room which hosted the event could not contain the theatrical machinery that this ending required. The Bacchantes scene was a substitution; Monteverdi&#x27;s intentions were restored when this constraint was removed.

===Composition===

When Monteverdi composed &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; he had a thorough grounding in theatrical music. He had been employed at the Gonzaga court for 16 years, much of it as a performer or arranger of stage music, and in 1604 he had written the ballo &quot;Gli amori di Diane ed Endimone&quot; for the 1604–05 Mantua Carnival. The elements from which Monteverdi constructed his first opera score—the aria, the strophic song, recitative, choruses, dances, dramatic musical interludes—were, as conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt has pointed out, not created by him, but &quot;he blended the entire stock of newest and older possibilities into a unity that was indeed new&quot;. Musicologist Robert Donington writes similarly: &quot;[The score] contains no element which was not based on precedent, but it reaches complete maturity in that recently developed form ... Here are words as directly expressed in music as [the pioneers of opera] wanted them expressed; here is music expressing them ... with the full inspiration of genius.&quot;

Monteverdi states the orchestral requirements at the beginning of his published score, but in accordance with the practice of the day he does not specify their exact usage. At that time it was usual to allow each interpreter of the work freedom to make local decisions, based on the orchestral forces at their disposal. These could differ sharply from place to place. Furthermore, as Harnoncourt points out, the instrumentalists would all have been composers and would have expected to collaborate creatively at each performance, rather than playing a set text. Another practice of the time was to allow singers to embellish their arias. Monteverdi wrote plain and embellished versions of some arias, such as Orfeo&#x27;s &quot;Possente spirto&quot;, but according to Harnoncourt &quot;it is obvious that where he did not write any embellishments he did not want any sung&quot;.

Each act of the opera deals with a single element of the story, and each ends with a chorus. Despite the five-act structure, with two sets of scene changes, it is likely that &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; conformed to the standard practice for court entertainments of that time and was played as a continuous entity, without intervals or curtain descents between acts. It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in sight of the audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key and style.

===Instrumentation===

For the purpose of analysis the music scholar Jane Glover has divided Monteverdi&#x27;s list of instruments into three main groups: strings, brass and continuo, with a few further items not easily classifiable. The strings grouping is formed from ten members of the violin family (&quot;viole da brazzo&quot;), two double basses (&quot;contrabassi de viola&quot;), and two kit violins (&quot;violini piccoli alla francese&quot;). The &quot;viole da brazzo&quot; are in two five-part ensembles, each comprising two violins, two violas and a cello. The brass group contains four or five trombones (sackbuts), three or four trumpets and two cornetts. The continuo forces include two harpsichords (&quot;duoi gravicembani&quot;), a double harp (&quot;arpa doppia&quot;), two or three chitarroni, two pipe organs (&quot;organi di legno&quot;), three bass viola da gamba, and a regal or small reed organ. Outside of these groupings are two recorders (&quot;flautini alla vigesima secunda&quot;), and possibly one or more citterns—unlisted by Monteverdi, but included in instructions relating to the end of act 4.

Instrumentally, the two worlds represented within the opera are distinctively portrayed. The pastoral world of the fields of Thrace is represented by the strings, harpsichords, harp, organs, recorders and chitarroni. The remaining instruments, mainly brass, are associated with the Underworld, though there is not an absolute distinction; strings appear on several occasions in the Hades scenes. Within this general ordering, specific instruments or combinations are used to accompany some of the main characters—Orpheus by harp and organ, shepherds by harpsichord and chitarrone, the Underworld gods by trombones and regal. All of these musical distinctions and characterisations were in accordance with the longstanding traditions of the Renaissance orchestra, of which the large &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; ensemble is typical.

Monteverdi instructs his players generally to &quot;[play] the work as simply and correctly as possible, and not with many florid passages or runs&quot;. Those playing ornamentation instruments such as strings and flutes are advised to &quot;play nobly, with much invention and variety&quot;, but are warned against overdoing it, whereby &quot;nothing is heard but chaos and confusion, offensive to the listener&quot;. Since at no time are all the instruments played together, the number of players needed is less than the number of instruments. Harnoncourt indicates that in Monteverdi&#x27;s day the numbers of players and singers together, and the small rooms in which performances were held, often meant that the audience barely numbered more than the performers.

Three of the instruments used in the original performance of &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; have had recent revivals: the cornetto (usually paired with sackbuts), the (a multi-course harp with sharps and flats) and the regal (an organ with fractional-length reed pipes). Instrumental color was widely used in specific dramatic situations during the 17c: in particular the regal was associated with Hades.

==Roles==
In his &quot;personaggi&quot; listed in the 1609 score, Monteverdi unaccountably omits La messaggera (the Messenger), and indicates that the final chorus of shepherds who perform the moresca (Moorish dance) at the opera&#x27;s end are a separate group (&quot;che fecero la moresca nel fine&quot;). Little information is available about who sang the various roles in the first performance. A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer Francesco Rasi took part, and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role. Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges &quot;with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling&quot;. The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato, Giovanni Gualberto Magli, is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes. Magli sang the prologue, Proserpina and possibly one other role, either La messaggera or Speranza. The musicologist and historian Hans Redlich mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo.

A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to &quot;that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo&quot;&quot;. This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo Bacchini, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.

There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits. Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows, a total of ten singers—three sopranos, two altos, three tenors and two basses—is required for a performance, with the soloists (except Orfeo) also forming the chorus. Carter&#x27;s suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza.

==Synopsis==
The action takes place in two contrasting locations: the fields of Thrace (acts 1, 2 and 5) and the Underworld (acts 3 and 4). An instrumental toccata (English: &quot;tucket&quot;, meaning a flourish on trumpets) precedes the entrance of La musica, representing the &quot;spirit of music&quot;, who sings a prologue of five stanzas of verse. After a gracious welcome to the audience she announces that she can, through sweet sounds, &quot;calm every troubled heart&quot;. She sings a further paean to the power of music, before introducing the drama&#x27;s main protagonist, Orfeo, who &quot;held the wild beasts spellbound with his song&quot;.

===Act 1===
After La musica&#x27;s final request for silence, the curtain rises on act 1 to reveal a pastoral scene. Orfeo and Euridice enter together with a chorus of nymphs and shepherds, who act in the manner of a Greek chorus, commenting on the action both as a group and as individuals. A shepherd announces that this is the couple&#x27;s wedding day; the chorus responds, first in a stately invocation (&quot;Come, Hymen, O come&quot;) and then in a joyful dance (&quot;Leave the mountains, leave the fountains&quot;). Orfeo and Euridice sing of their love for each other before leaving with most of the group for the wedding ceremony in the temple. Those left on stage sing a brief chorus, commenting on how Orfeo used to be one &quot;for whom sighs were food and weeping was drink&quot; before love brought him to a state of sublime happiness.

===Act 2===
Orfeo returns with the main chorus, and sings with them of the beauties of nature. Orfeo then muses on his former unhappiness, but proclaims: &quot;After grief one is more content, after pain one is happier&quot;. The mood of contentment is abruptly ended when La messaggera enters, bringing the news that, while gathering flowers, Euridice has received a fatal snakebite. The chorus expresses its anguish: &quot;Ah, bitter happening, ah, impious and cruel fate!&quot;, while the Messaggera castigates herself as the bearing of bad tidings (&quot;For ever I will flee, and in a lonely cavern lead a life in keeping with my sorrow&quot;). Orfeo, after venting his grief and incredulity (&quot;Thou art dead, my life, and I am breathing?&quot;), declares his intention to descend into the Underworld and persuade its ruler to allow Euridice to return to life. Otherwise, he says, &quot;I shall remain with thee in the company of death&quot;. He departs, and the chorus resumes its lament.

===Act 3===
Orfeo is guided by Speranza to the gates of Hades. Having pointed out the words inscribed on the gate (&quot;Abandon all hope, ye who enter here&quot;), Speranza leaves. Orfeo is now confronted with the ferryman Caronte, who addresses Orfeo harshly and refuses to take him across the river Styx. Orfeo attempts to persuade Caronte by singing a flattering song to him (&quot;Mighty spirit and powerful divinity&quot;), and, although the ferryman is moved by his music (&quot;Indeed thou charmest me, appeasing my heart&quot;), he does not allow him to pass, claiming he is incapable of feeling pity. However, when Orfeo takes up his lyre and plays, Caronte is soothed into sleep. Seizing his chance, Orfeo steals the ferryman&#x27;s boat and crosses the river, entering the Underworld while a chorus of spirits reflects that nature cannot defend herself against man: &quot;He has tamed the sea with fragile wood, and disdained the rage of the winds.&quot;

===Act 4===
In the Underworld, Proserpina, Queen of Hades, who has been deeply affected by Orfeo&#x27;s singing, petitions King Plutone, her husband, for Euridice&#x27;s release. Moved by her pleas, Plutone agrees on the condition that, as he leads Euridice towards the world, Orfeo must not look back. If he does, &quot;a single glance will condemn him to eternal loss&quot;. Orfeo enters, leading Euridice and singing confidently that on that day he will rest on his wife&#x27;s white bosom. But as he sings a note of doubt creeps in: &quot;Who will assure me that she is following?&quot;. Perhaps, he thinks, Plutone, driven by envy, has imposed the condition through spite? Suddenly distracted by an off-stage commotion, Orfeo looks round; immediately, the image of Euridice begins to fade. She sings, despairingly: &quot;Losest thou me through too much love?&quot; and disappears. Orfeo attempts to follow her but is drawn away by an unseen force. The chorus of spirits sings that Orfeo, having overcome Hades, was in turn overcome by his passions.

===Act 5===
Back in the fields of Thrace, Orfeo has a long soliloquy in which he laments his loss, praises Euridice&#x27;s beauty and resolves that his heart will never again be pierced by Cupid&#x27;s arrow. An off-stage echo repeats his final phrases. Suddenly, in a cloud, Apollo descends from the heavens and chastises him: &quot;Why dost thou give thyself up as prey to rage and grief?&quot; He invites Orfeo to leave the world and join him in the heavens, where he will recognise Euridice&#x27;s likeness in the stars. Orfeo replies that it would be unworthy not to follow the counsel of such a wise father, and together they ascend. A shepherds&#x27; chorus concludes that &quot;he who sows in suffering shall reap the fruit of every grace&quot;, before the opera ends with a vigorous moresca.

===Original libretto ending===
In Striggio&#x27;s 1607 libretto, Orfeo&#x27;s act 5 soliloquy is interrupted, not by Apollo&#x27;s appearance but by a chorus of maenads or Bacchantes—wild, drunken women—who sing of the &quot;divine fury&quot; of their master, the god Bacchus. The cause of their wrath is Orfeo and his renunciation of women; he will not escape their heavenly anger, and the longer he evades them the more severe his fate will be. Orfeo leaves the scene and his destiny is left uncertain, as the Bacchantes devote themselves for the rest of the opera to wild singing and dancing in praise of Bacchus. The early music authority Claude Palisca believes that the two endings are not incompatible; Orfeo might evade the fury of the Bacchantes and be rescued by Apollo. However, this alternative ending in any case nearer to original classic myth, where the Bacchantes also appear, but it is made explicit that they torture him to his death, followed by reunion as a shade with Euridice but no apotheosis nor any interaction with Apollo.

==Reception and performance history==

===Premiere and early performances===

The date for the first performance of &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, 24 February 1607, is evidenced by two letters, both dated 23 February. In the first, Francesco Gonzaga informs his brother that the &quot;musical play&quot; will be performed tomorrow; it is clear from earlier correspondence that this refers to &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;. The second letter is from a Gonzaga court official, Carlo Magno, and gives more details: &quot;Tomorrow evening the Most Serene Lord the Prince is to sponsor a [play] in a room in the apartments which the Most Serene Lady had the use of ...it should be most unusual, as all the actors are to sing their parts.&quot; The &quot;Serene Lady&quot; is Duke Vincenzo&#x27;s widowed sister Margherita Gonzaga d&#x27;Este, who lived within the Ducal Palace. The room of the premiere cannot be identified with certainty; according to Ringer, it may have been the Galleria dei Fiumi, which has the dimensions to accommodate a stage and orchestra with space for a small audience.

There is no detailed account of the premiere, although Francesco wrote on 1 March that the work had &quot;been to the great satisfaction of all who heard it&quot;, and had particularly pleased the Duke. The Mantuan court theologian and poet, Cherubino Ferrari wrote that: &quot;Both poet and musician have depicted the inclinations of the heart so skilfully that it could not have been done better ... The music, observing due propriety, serves the poetry so well that nothing more beautiful is to be heard anywhere&quot;. After the premiere Duke Vincenzo ordered a second performance for 1 March; a third performance was planned to coincide with a proposed state visit to Mantua by the Duke of Savoy. Francesco wrote to the Duke of Tuscany on 8 March, asking if he could retain the services of the castrato Magli for a little longer. However, the visit was cancelled, as was the celebratory performance.

There are suggestions that in the years following the premiere, &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; may have been staged in Florence, Cremona, Milan and Turin, though firmer evidence suggests that the work attracted limited interest beyond the Mantuan court. Francesco may have mounted a production in Casale Monferrato, where he was governor, for the 1609–10 Carnival, and there are indications that the work was performed on several occasions in Salzburg between 1614 and 1619, under the direction of Francesco Rasi. Years later, during the first flourish of Venetian opera in 1637–43, Monteverdi chose to revive his second opera, &quot;L&#x27;Arianna&quot; there, but not &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;. There is some evidence of a performance shortly after Monteverdi&#x27;s death in Geneva in 1643. Although according to Carter the work was still admired across Italy in the 1650s, it was subsequently forgotten, as largely was Monteverdi, until the revival of interest in his works in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortune/Whenham&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century revivals===

After years of neglect, Monteverdi&#x27;s music began to attract the interest of pioneer music historians in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and from the second quarter of the 19th century onwards he is discussed increasingly in scholarly works. In 1881 a truncated version of the &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; score, intended for study rather than performance, was published in Berlin by Robert Eitner. In 1904 the composer Vincent d&#x27;Indy produced an edition in French, which comprised only act 2, a shortened act 3 and act 4. This edition was the basis of the first public performance of the work in two-and-a-half centuries, a concert performance at d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s Schola Cantorum on 25 February 1904. The distinguished writer Romain Rolland, who was present, commended d&#x27;Indy for bringing the opera to life and returning it &quot;to the beauty it once had, freeing it from the clumsy restorations which have disfigured it&quot;—presumably a reference to Eitner&#x27;s edition. The d&#x27;Indy edition was also the basis of the first modern staged performance of the work, at the Théâtre Réjane, Paris, on 2 May 1911.

An edition of the score by the minor Italian composer Giacomo Orefice (Milan, 1909) received several concert performances in Italy and elsewhere before and after the First World War. This edition was the basis of the opera&#x27;s United States debut, another concert performance at the New York Met in April 1912. The opera was introduced to London, in d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s edition, when it was sung to piano accompaniment at the Institut Français on 8 March 1924. The first British staged performance, with only small cuts, was given by the Oxford University Operatic Society on 7 December 1925, using an edition prepared for the event by Jack Westrup. In the London &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, music critic Dyneley Hussey called the occasion &quot;one of the most important events of recent years&quot;; the production had &quot;indicated at once Monteverdi&#x27;s claim to rank among the great geniuses who have written dramatic music&quot;. Westrup&#x27;s edition was revived in London at the Scala Theatre in December 1929, the same year in which the opera received its first US staged performance, at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts. The three Scala performances resulted in a financial disaster, and the opera was not seen again in Britain for 35 years.

Among a flurry of revivals after 1945 was Paul Hindemith&#x27;s edition, a full period reconstruction of the work prepared in 1943, which was staged and recorded at the Vienna Festival in 1954. This performance had a great impact on the young Nikolaus Harnoncourt, and was hailed as a masterpiece of scholarship and integrity. The first staged New York performance, by the New York City Opera under Leopold Stokowski on 29 September 1960, saw the American operatic debut of Gérard Souzay, one of several baritones who have sung the role of Orfeo. The theatre was criticised by &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Harold C. Schonberg because, to accommodate a performance of Luigi Dallapiccola&#x27;s contemporary opera &quot;Il prigioniero&quot;, about a third of &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; was cut. Schonberg wrote: &quot;Even the biggest aria in the opera, &#x27;Possente spirito&#x27;, has a good-sized slash in the middle ... [&quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;] is long enough, and important enough, not to mention beautiful enough, to have been the entire evening&#x27;s opera.&quot;

By the latter part of the 20th century the opera was being shown all over the world. In 1965, Sadler&#x27;s Wells, forerunner of English National Opera (ENO), staged the first of many ENO presentations which would continue into the 21st century. Among various celebrations marking the opera&#x27;s 400th anniversary in 2007 were a semi-staged performance at the Teatro Bibiena in Mantua, a full-scale production by the English Bach Festival (EBF) at the Whitehall Banqueting House in London on 7 February, and an unconventional production by Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, New York, conducted by Antony Walker and directed by Christopher Alden. On 6 May 2010 the BBC broadcast a performance of the opera from La Scala, Milan. Despite the reluctance of some major opera houses to stage &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, it is a popular work with the leading Baroque ensembles. During the period 2008–10, the French-based Les Arts Florissants, under its director William Christie, presented the Monteverdi trilogy of operas (&quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;) in a series of performances at the Teatro Real in Madrid.

==Music==
&quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; is, in Redlich&#x27;s analysis, the product of two musical epochs. It combines elements of the traditional madrigal style of the 16th century with those of the emerging Florentine mode, in particular the use of recitative and monodic singing as developed by the Camerata and their successors. In this new style, the text dominates the music; while sinfonias and instrumental ritornelli illustrate the action, the audience&#x27;s attention is always drawn primarily to the words. The singers are required to do more than produce pleasant vocal sounds; they must represent their characters in depth and convey appropriate emotions.

Monterverdi&#x27;s recitative style was influenced by Peri&#x27;s, in &quot;Euridice&quot;, although in &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; recitative is less preponderant than was usual in dramatic music at this time. It accounts for less than a quarter of the first act&#x27;s music, around a third of the second and third acts, and a little under half in the final two acts.

The importance of &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; is not that it was the first work of its kind, but that it was the first attempt to apply the full resources of the art of music, as then evolved, to the nascent genre of opera. In particular, Monteverdi made daring innovations in the use of polyphony, of which Palestrina had been the principal exponent. In &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, Monteverdi extends the rules, beyond the conventions which polyphonic composers, faithful to Palestrina, had previously considered as sacrosanct. Monteverdi was not in the generally understood sense an orchestrator; Ringer finds that it is the element of instrumental improvisation that makes each performance of a Monteverdi opera a &quot;unique experience, and separates his work from the later operatic canon&quot;.

The opera begins with a martial-sounding toccata for trumpets which is repeated twice. When played on period wind instruments the sound can be startling to modern audiences; Redlich calls it &quot;shattering&quot;. Such flourishes were the standard signal for the commencement of performances at the Mantuan court; the opening chorus of Monteverdi&#x27;s 1610 Vespers, also composed for Gonzaga&#x27;s court, employs the same fanfare. The toccata acted as a salute to the Duke; according to Donington, if it had not been written, precedent would have required it to be improvised. As the brass sound of the toccata fades, it is replaced by the gentler tone of the strings ritornello which introduces La musica&#x27;s prologue. The ritornello is repeated in shortened form between each of the prologue&#x27;s five verses, and in full after the final verse. Its function within the opera as a whole is to represent the &quot;power of music&quot;; as such it is heard at the end of act 2, and again at the beginning of act 5, one of the earliest examples of an operatic leitmotiv. It is temporally structured as a palindrome and its form of strophic variations allows Monteverdi to carefully shape musical time for expressive and structural purposes in the context of &quot;seconda prattica&quot;.

After the prologue, act 1 follows in the form of a pastoral idyll. Two choruses, one solemn and one jovial are repeated in reverse order around the central love-song &quot;Rosa del ciel&quot; (&quot;Rose of the heavens&quot;), followed by the shepherds&#x27; songs of praise. The buoyant mood continues into act 2, with song and dance music influenced, according to Harnoncourt, by Monteverdi&#x27;s experience of French music. The sudden entrance of La messaggera with the doleful news of Euridice&#x27;s death, and the confusion and grief which follow, are musically reflected by harsh dissonances and the juxtaposition of keys. The music remains in this vein until the act ends with La musica&#x27;s ritornello, a hint that the &quot;power of music&quot; may yet bring about a triumph over death. Monteverdi&#x27;s instructions as the act concludes are that the violins, the organ and harpsichord become silent and that the music is taken up by the trombones, the cornetts and the regal, as the scene changes to the Underworld.

The centrepiece of act 3, perhaps of the entire opera, is Orfeo&#x27;s extended aria &quot;Possente spirto e formidabil nume&quot; (&quot;Mighty spirit and powerful divinity&quot;), by which he attempts to persuade Caronte to allow him to enter Hades. Monteverdi&#x27;s vocal embellishments and virtuoso accompaniment provide what Carter describes as &quot;one of the most compelling visual and aural representations&quot; in early opera. Instrumental colour is provided by a chitarrone, a pipe-organ, two violins, two cornetts and a double-harp. This array, according to music historian and analyst John Whenham, is intended to suggest that Orfeo is harnessing all the available forces of music to support his plea. In act 4 the impersonal coldness of the Underworld is broken by the warmth of Proserpina&#x27;s singing on behalf of Orfeo, a warmth that is retained until the dramatic moment at which Orfeo &quot;looks back&quot;. The cold sounds of the sinfonia from the beginning of act 3 then remind us that the Underworld is, after all, entirely devoid of human feeling. The brief final act, which sees Orfeo&#x27;s rescue and metamorphosis, is framed by the final appearance of La musica&#x27;s ritornello and the lively moresca that ends the opera. This dance, says Ringer, recalls the jigs danced at the end of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies, and provides a means of bringing the audience back to their everyday world, &quot;just as the toccata had led them into another realm some two hours before. The toccata and the moresca unite courtly reality with operatic illusion.&quot;

==Recording history==
The first recording of &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; was issued in 1939, a freely adapted version of Monteverdi&#x27;s music by Giacomo Benvenuti, given by the orchestra of La Scala Milan conducted by Ferrucio Calusio. In 1949, for the recording of the complete opera by the Berlin Radio Orchestra conducted by Helmut Koch, the new medium of long-playing records (LPs) was used. The advent of LP recordings was, as Harold C. Schonberg later wrote, an important factor in the postwar revival of interest in Renaissance and Baroque music, and from the mid-1950s recordings of &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; have been issued on many labels. The 1969 recording by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and the Vienna Concentus Musicus, using Harnoncourt&#x27;s edition based on period instruments, was praised for &quot;making Monteverdi&#x27;s music sound something like the way he imagined&quot;. In 1981 Siegfried Heinrich, with the Early Music Studio of the Hesse Chamber Orchestra, recorded a version which re-created the original Striggio libretto ending, adding music from Monteverdi&#x27;s 1616 ballet &quot;Tirsi e Clori&quot; for the Bacchante scenes. A few dozen commercial audio recordings have been released since 1939. 

The first video recording was released in 1978, with Nikolaus Harnoncourt (conductor) and Jean-Pierre Ponnelle (director). Since then nine video recordings have been commercially released. See &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; discography.

==Editions==
After the publication of the &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner&#x27;s first &quot;modern&quot; edition of &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; in 1884, and d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d&#x27;Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff&#x27;s 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.

In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi&#x27;s day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero&#x27;s 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi&#x27;s 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith&#x27;s attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra. In the 21st century editions continue to be produced, often for use in conjunction with a particular performance or recording.

<text>Ahmed Boughèra El Ouafi (; 15 October 1898 – 18 October 1959) was a French athlete who won the 1928 Olympic Marathon.

==Biography==

Source:

El Ouafi was born in the town of Ouled Djellal, joining the French military regiment later (at that time, Algeria was part of French Algeria). One of his superior officers noticed El Ouafi&#x27;s outstanding athletic abilities, and decided to send him to military sports competition in mainland France.

He became a factory worker at Renault in Boulogne-Billancourt near Paris and in 1924 and became France marathon champion thus qualifying for the 1924 Olympic Marathon

Boughèra El Ouafi completed his first Olympic marathon, running for France, in seventh position.

He became France marathon champion for the second and last time in 1928, thus qualifying for the 1928 Olympic Marathon

In the 1928 competition, he ran behind the leaders for the first three quarters of the race, overtaking them some 5 km before the end. He was never caught by any of the other runners, and finished first, 26 seconds ahead of second-placed Manuel Plaza from Chile. El Ouafi was the only representative of French athletics to win gold at the 1928 Olympics.

After his surprise victory, El Ouafi toured the United States. However, the money he earned with this trip disqualified him as an amateur, causing him to leave the sport, and he opened a cafe in Paris. El Ouafi remained forgotten until 1956, when another Algerian, Alain Mimoun, also won the Olympic marathon. Reporters went to seek out the other Algerian who had won 28 years earlier, and found him a pauper.

El Ouafi was killed while in a café, three days after his 61st birthday. Accounts of his death vary. French media then said that he was targeted by members of the National Liberation Front after he had refused to support them; other accounts say he was a bystander victim of an argument between family members and revolutionaries, or was killed during a family quarrel.

<text>Nova Gorica () is a town in western Slovenia, on the border with Italy. It is the seat of the Municipality of Nova Gorica. Nova Gorica is a planned town, built according to the principles of modernist architecture after 1947, when the Paris Peace Treaty established a new border between Yugoslavia and Italy, leaving nearby Gorizia outside the borders of Yugoslavia and thus cutting off the Soča Valley, the Vipava Valley, the Gorizia Hills and the northwestern Karst Plateau from their traditional regional urban centre. It is the European Capital of Culture in 2025. Since 1948, Nova Gorica has replaced Gorizia as the principal urban center of the Gorizia region (), as the northern part of the Slovenian Littoral has been traditionally called. Since May 2011, Nova Gorica has been joined with Gorizia and Šempeter-Vrtojba in a common trans-border metropolitan zone, administered by a joint administration board.

== Name ==

The name &quot;Nova Gorica&quot; means &#x27;new Gorizia&#x27;. The origin of the name &quot;Gorizia/Gorica&quot; itself is Slavic. The common local term for the town is &quot;Gorica&quot; (i.e., without the modifier &quot;nova&quot; &#x27;new&#x27;), while residents tend to refer to the neighboring Italian town as &quot;Stara Gorica&quot; (i.e., &#x27;old Gorizia&#x27;). This use is also reflected in Slovenian license plates (&quot;GO&quot; for Gorica), as well as in the name of the local association football club ND Gorica. The word &quot;gorica&quot; is a diminutive form of the Slovene common noun &quot;gora&quot; &#x27;hill&#x27;. In archaic Slovene, it also meant &#x27;vineyard&#x27;. It is a common toponym in Slovenia and in other areas of Slovene settlement, as well as more generally in areas that have or historically had a Slavic-speaking population.

== History ==
In 1947, following World War II, Italy signed a peace treaty with the Allies, including Socialist Yugoslavia. The treaty transferred most of the Slovene-inhabited areas of the Province of Gorizia to Yugoslavia. The town of Gorizia itself, however, remained under Italian rule. The new border cut the city off from its northern and eastern suburbs. Around 40% of the municipality&#x27;s territory was transferred to Yugoslavia, including the suburbs of Solkan, Šempeter, Kromberk, Rožna Dolina, and Pristava. Together, these areas had a population of around 10,000 (almost exclusively Slovenes, with a tiny Friulian-speaking minority), or around one fifth of the municipality&#x27;s population. However, they lacked a cohesive structure, and were poorly connected. In order to overcome this problem, the Communist authorities of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia decided to build a new settlement that would connect these suburbs into a new urban space. The new town was called Nova Gorica or &quot;New Gorizia&quot;. The project had the personal backing of Marshal Tito, Yugoslavia&#x27;s Communist leader. The project was commissioned to the Slovenian architect Edvard Ravnikar, a former pupil of Le Corbusier. The first projects were laid out in winter of 1947, and the construction began at the beginning of the following year. 

The city was formally established as an urban municipality in 1952, incorporating the older settlements of Solkan, Kromberk and Rožna Dolina, which thus became, somewhat reluctantly, suburbs of Nova Gorica. The building of the town continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s, reaching the current extent by the mid-1980s. In the early 1990s, all of the aforementioned older suburbs acquired again the status of independent settlements. This was however a purely symbolic act that only affected the official statistics on population: because of this, Nova Gorica dropped from the list of 10 largest towns in Slovenia. It nevertheless remains the second largest urban conglomeration in western Slovenia, after Koper.

==Climate==

== Culture and education ==
Nova Gorica hosts one of the three national theatres in Slovenia. The is also located in the town&#x27;s Kromberk district, hosted in Kromberk Castle.

The University of Nova Gorica is located in the suburb of Rožna Dolina. The Nova Gorica Grammar School, located in the city centre, is one of the most renowned high schools in Slovenia.

The cultural magazine &quot;Razpotja&quot; is published in Nova Gorica.

Nova Gorica and Gorizia won their joint bid to be designated as European Capital of Culture in 2025; the other city selected for that year is Chemnitz, Germany.

== Kostanjevica Hill ==

To the south of the town stands Kostanjevica Hill, home to the Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady and a 17th-century Franciscan monastery with rich treasures from the past. The last members of the Bourbons, the French royal family, are buried in a crypt beneath the church (Charles X himself, and members of his family and entourage including his son Louis-Antoine de France, and his grandson Henri d&#x27;Artois, nephew of Louis (neither Louis-Antoine nor Henri ever reigned as kings)). He fled France following the revolution in 1830, finding refuge in Gorizia, and eventually died there. Also buried there is Pierre Louis Jean Casimir de Blacas, a Bourbon nobleman who also died in exile (in 1839).

== Sveta Gora ==

Opposite Kostanjevica Hill, north of the town is the settlement of Sveta Gora with Holy Mount () a peak that has attracted pilgrims for 450 years. The view from there is exceptional, and on a clear day visitors can see as far as Istria, Venice, the Dolomites, and the Kamnik and Julian Alps. The mountain top is home to a magnificent basilica, where concerts are occasionally held, a Franciscan monastery, and a museum of the Battles of the Isonzo.

<doc id="486209" wikidata="Q6419093" url="?curid=486209" title="Kiyoshi Kawakami">
<text>was a Japanese Christian journalist who published several books in the United States and the United Kingdom. He was born in Yonezawa, educated in the law in Japan, and was for a short time engaged in newspaper work in that country.

He sometimes wrote under the name of K. K. Kawakami. Although Japanese do not have middle names, he is said to have been a socialist in his youth, when he apparently adopted the middle name &quot;Karl&quot; (from Karl Marx).

In 1901 he travelled to the United States and studied at the universities of Iowa and Wisconsin. In 1905, engaged in journalism, he traveled extensively in China, Siberia, and Russia. He was a correspondent for leading newspapers in Tokyo and a frequent contributor to American magazines and newspapers.

== Early life ==
Source:

Kiyoshi Kawakami was the youngest born into a family of three brothers and three sisters, with the given name of Yushichi Miyashita. His mother died probably related to childbirth, and his father died soon after. Within the next two years, his oldest brother died of war wounds and another brother died from an illness. He and his siblings lived with their grandmother in poverty, selling family belongings to put food on the table. When he was six years old he was put into the care of the local Shinto shrine in order to relieve food insecurity in the family.

He returned home, however, homesick, and was read to frequently by his grandmother. When he was eight years old, his grandmother sold more belongings to be able to send him to elementary school. He was able to go onto junior high school, where he learned English at the age of thirteen.

Kiyoshi Kawakami was fourteen years old when he heard his first pro-democracy speech at a playhouse in town. He was fifteen years old when he met his first foreigner, American Methodist missionary J.G. Cleveland who taught English at the Yonezawa junior-high school.

In 1890 at seventeen years old, Kawakami went to Tokyo, where he worked as a houseboy in exchange for educational opportunities provided by a growing number of sponsoring acquaintances, first among them Retired Navy Lieutenant Toshitoro Sone and including Mr. Shigenori Uesugi who helped him attend Tokyo Law Institute (at present the CHUO university).

After his sponsor Uesugi ended, he was admitted to English vocational school Aoyama Institute, now Aoyama Gakuin University, by Methodist minister Koichi Honda. It was at the Aoyama Institute that Kawakami acquired his nickname &quot;Karl&quot; after a new enthusiasm he found for Karl Marx — a nickname he began to use as a middle name, especially on his later published work. Upon leaving the Aoyama Institute at twenty-three, Kawakami taught English to noncommissioned officers and began a career as a freelance writer with an article for a youth magazine and a German history book for high-schoolers commissioned by publisher Otowa Ohashi.

==Writings==
Kawakami&#x27;s pre-war writings sought to whitewash the Japanese military and economic penetration and invasion of China and Manchuria, presenting Japanese actions as aimed at saving China from chaos and disintegration. At the same time, however, they presented China as &quot;scheming&quot; to distort and obstruct Japanese goodwill in order to turn Western opinion against Japan. He was regarded in the United States as an apologist for Japanese imperialism and was briefly arrested after the outbreak of war. Some of his writings were included in the massive, ten volume series &quot;Japanese Propaganda: Selected Readings: A Collection&quot; edited by Peter O&#x27;Connor of Musashino University and published by the University of Hawaii Press in 2004.

According to Gary Y. Okihiro, the Japanese government subsidized Kawakami to refute the hostile writers and establish a favorable image of Japanese in the American mind. Kawakami&#x27;s books especially &quot;Asia at the Door&quot; (1914) and &quot;The Real Japanese Question&quot; (1921) tried to refute the false slanders generated by deceitful agitators and politicians. The books confront the main allegations regarding assimilation, and boast of the positive Japanese contributions to American economy and society, especially in Hawaii and California.

<doc id="486215" wikidata="Q159658" url="?curid=486215" title="ODESSA">
<text>ODESSA is an American codename (from the German: &quot;Organisation der ehemaligen SS-Angehörigen&quot;, meaning: Organization of Former SS Members) coined in 1946 to cover Nazi underground escape-plans made at the end of World War II by a group of &quot;SS&quot; officers with the aim of facilitating secret escape routes, and any directly ensuing arrangements. The concept of the existence of an actual ODESSA organisation has circulated widely in fictional spy novels and movies, including Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s best-selling 1972 thriller &quot;The Odessa File&quot;. The escape-routes have become known as &quot;ratlines&quot;. Known goals of elements within the &quot;SS&quot; included allowing &quot;SS&quot; members to escape to Argentina or to the Middle East under false passports.

Although an unknown number of wanted Nazis and war criminals escaped Germany and often Europe, most experts deny that an organisation called ODESSA ever existed. The term itself is only recorded certainly as an American construction, coined to cover a range of planning, arrangements, including those enacted and those simply envisaged, and both known and hypothesised groups. There has been and remains some confusion over the years of the use of the term &quot;ODESSA&quot;. About 300 Nazis found their way to Argentina with support from Juan Perón after he was democratically elected president of Argentina in 1946.

Uki Goñi maintains that archival evidence paints a picture that &quot;does not even include an organization actually named Odessa, but it is sinister nonetheless, and weighted in favour of an actual organized escape network.&quot; Guy Walters, in his 2009 book &quot;Hunting Evil&quot;, stated he was unable to find any evidence of the existence of the ODESSA network as such, although numerous other organisations such as &quot;Konsul&quot;, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, &quot;Sechsgestirn&quot;, &quot;Leibwache&quot;, and &quot;Lustige Brüder&quot; have been named, including &quot;Die Spinne&quot; (&quot;The Spider&quot;) run in part by Hitler&#x27;s commando-chief Otto Skorzeny. Historian Daniel Stahl in his 2011 essay stated that the consensus among historians is that an organisation called &quot;ODESSA&quot; did not actually exist.

Goñi&#x27;s book &quot;The Real Odessa&quot; describes the role of Juan Perón in providing cover for Nazi war criminals with cooperation from the Vatican, the Argentinian government and the Swiss authorities through a secret office set up by Perón&#x27;s agents in Bern. Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s secret service had prepared an escape-route in Madrid in 1944. In 1946, this operation moved to the Presidential palace in Buenos Aires. Goñi states that the operation stretched from Scandinavia to Italy, aiding war criminals and bringing in gold that the Croatian treasury had stolen.

==Origins of the term==
The codeword &quot;Odessa&quot;—as used by the Allies—appeared for the first time in a memo dated 3 July 1946, by the United States Army Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) whose principal role was to screen displaced persons for possible suspects. The CIC discovered that &quot;ODESSA&quot; was used at the KZ Bensheim-Auerbach internment camp for &quot;SS&quot; prisoners who used this watchword in their secret attempts to gain special privileges from the International Red Cross, wrote historian Guy Walters. Neither the Americans nor the British were able to verify the claims extending any further than that.

==History==
According to Simon Wiesenthal, the ODESSA was set up in 1944 to aid fugitive Nazis. However, a documentary produced by the German TV station ZDF also suggested that the ODESSA was never the single world-wide secret organisation that Wiesenthal described, but several organisations, both overt and covert, that helped ex-SS men. The truth may have been obscured by antagonism between the Wiesenthal Organisation and West German military intelligence. It is known that Austrian authorities were investigating the organization several years before Wiesenthal went public with his information.

Similarly, historian Gitta Sereny wrote in her book &quot;Into That Darkness&quot; (1974), based on interviews with the former commandant of the Treblinka extermination camp, Franz Stangl, that an organisation called ODESSA had never existed although there were Nazi aid organisations:

This view is supported by historian Guy Walters in his book &quot;Hunting Evil&quot;, where he also indicates networks were used, but there was not such a thing as a setup network covering Europe and South America, with an alleged war treasure. For Walters, the reports received by the allied intelligence services during the mid-1940s suggest that the appellation &quot;ODESSA&quot; was &quot;little more than a catch-all term used by former Nazis who wished to continue the fight.&quot;

Nazi concentration camp supervisors denied the existence of an organisation called ODESSA. The US War Crimes Commission reports and the American Office of Strategic Services neither confirmed nor denied claims about the existence of such an organisation. Wechsberg, who after emigrating to the United States had served as an OSS officer and member of the US War Crimes Commission, however, claimed that in interviews of outspoken German anti-Nazis some asserted that plans were made for a Fourth Reich before the fall of the Third, and that this was to be implemented by reorganising in remote Nazi colonies overseas: &quot;The Nazis decided that the time had come to set up a world-wide clandestine escape network.&quot;

In his interviews with Sereny, Stangl denied any knowledge of a group called the ODESSA. Recent biographies of Adolf Eichmann, who also escaped to South America, and Heinrich Himmler, the alleged founder of the ODESSA, made no reference to such an organisation. In her book &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot;, Hannah Arendt states that &quot;in 1950, [Eichmann] succeeded in establishing contact with ODESSA, a clandestine organisation of &quot;SS&quot; veterans, and in May of that year, he was passed through Austria to Italy, where a priest, fully informed of his identity, equipped him with a refugee passport in the name of Richard Klement and sent him on to Buenos Aires.&quot; Notorious Auschwitz doctor Josef Mengele also escaped to Argentina, and later fled to Paraguay and finally Brazil.

Sereny attributed the escape of &quot;SS&quot; members to postwar chaos and the inability of the Catholic Church, the Red Cross and the United States Armed Forces to verify the claims of people who came to them for help, rather than to the activities of an underground Nazi organisation. She identified a Vatican official, Bishop Aloïs Hudal, not former &quot;SS&quot; men, as the principal agent in helping Nazis leave Italy for South America, mainly Brazil.

Of particular importance in examining the postwar activities of high-ranking Nazis was Paul Manning&#x27;s book &quot;Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile,&quot; which detailed Martin Bormann&#x27;s rise to power through the Nazi Party and as Hitler&#x27;s Chief of Staff. During the war, Manning himself was a correspondent for CBS News in London, and his reporting and subsequent researches presented Bormann&#x27;s cunning and skill in the organisation and planning for the flight of Nazi-controlled capital from Europe during the last years of the war—notwithstanding the strong possibility of Bormann&#x27;s death in Berlin on 1 May 1945, especially in light of DNA identification in 1998 of skeletal remains unearthed near the Lehrter Bahnhof in 1972 as Bormann&#x27;s.

According to Manning, &quot;eventually, over 10,000 former German military made it to South America along escape routes set up by (the) ODESSA and the &quot;Deutsche Hilfsverein&quot;...&quot;. The ODESSA itself was incidental, says Manning, with the continuing existence of the Bormann Organisation a much larger and more menacing fact. None of this had yet been convincingly proven.

==ODESSA as myth==
German historian has examined an idea of ODESSA as a myth, or inflation of real circumstances (which remained largely unknown for a long time), suggesting reasons why such a phenomenon may become popular. He emphasized both the dashed dreams of fervent Nazis, and the horrible nightmares of Nazi victims. He suggested both impulses sustained a belief in a false myth, also conflating within that American government interest in delegitimizing the Peron regime.

==In popular culture==
In the realm of fiction, Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s best-selling thriller &quot;The Odessa File&quot; (1972) brought the organisation to popular attention. (The novel was turned into a film starring Jon Voight.) In the novel, Forsyth&#x27;s ODESSA smuggled war criminals to South America, but also attempted to protect those &quot;SS&quot; members who remained behind in Germany, and plotted to influence political decisions in West Germany. Many of the novel&#x27;s readers assumed that ODESSA really existed.

In the thriller novel by Ira Levin titled &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1976), Dr. Josef Mengele, the concentration camp medical doctor who performed horrific experiments on camp victims during World War II, is involved in ODESSA. According to a young man and spy on his trail, Mengele is activating the &quot;Kameradenwerk&quot; for a strange assignment: he is sending out six Nazis (former &quot;SS&quot; officers) to kill 94 men, who share a few common traits. In the book, the terms &quot;Kameradenwerk&quot; and &quot;ODESSA&quot; are used interchangeably.

The BBC TV Serial Kessler is a fictional account of the uncovering by investigative journalists and western intelligence agencies of the ODESSA-like &quot;Kameradenwerk&quot; organisation responsible for the escape and support of Nazis after the war. It features a fictionalised version of Dr. Josef Mengele and other Nazis in hiding in Paraguay.

During the Watergate scandal, G. Gordon Liddy referred to the White House Plumbers as ODESSA in reference to the Nazi organization.

It was mentioned in three Phoenix Force novels: &quot;Ultimate Terror&quot; (1984), &quot;The Twisted Cross&quot; (1986) and &quot;Terror In The Dark&quot; (1987). It was also mentioned, sometimes in veiled terms, in Philip Kerr&#x27;s 2006 novel, &quot;The One from the Other&quot;—one of Kerr&#x27;s Bernie Gunther mysteries. Novelist Eric Frattini has emphasised his belief in ODESSA and incorporates elements in his novels, such as the 2010 thriller, &quot;The Mephisto&#x27;s Gold&quot;.

During the confession sequence of the first episode of &quot;Archer&quot;’s 5th season, Dr. Krieger mentions ODESSA and ratlines, affirming him being a reference to &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot;.

The First Order, the main antagonists from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel trilogy, were based on the concept of ODESSA, in particular the theory that several Nazis escaped into Argentina.

Bormann&#x27;s survival and the ratline are also part of the History Channel TV series &quot;Hunting Hitler&quot; (2015–2018) in which former CIA agent Bob Baer, Gerrard Williams (author of &quot;Grey Wolf: The Escape of Adolf Hitler&quot;) and Tim Kennedy, a former member of the 7th Special Forces Group of the US Army, try to prove that Hitler might have survived WWII and fled to Argentina.

ODESSA and another secret society was mentioned in Terry Hayes&#x27; novel &quot;I Am Pilgrim&quot;. In the novel, the main character, disguised as an FBI agent in Damascus, is searching for a secret passage and encounters a tunnel with German inscriptions. Names of &quot;SS&quot; military personnel involved with the construction of the tunnel are listed.

ODESSA serves as the main antagonist in the Blake and Mortimer comic &quot;The Curse of the Thirty Denarii,&quot; in which ODESSA members hunt for the 30 pieces of silver given to Judas in exchange for betraying Jesus, believing it will help them take over the world.

<text>Richard George Rogers, Baron Rogers of Riverside (23 July 1933 – 18 December 2021) was a British-Italian architect noted for his modernist and constructivist designs in high-tech architecture. He was the founder at Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, previously known as the Richard Rogers Partnership, until June 2020. After Rogers&#x27; retirement and death, the firm rebranded to simply RSHP on 30 June 2022.

Rogers was perhaps best known for his work on the Pompidou Centre in Paris, the Lloyd&#x27;s building and Millennium Dome, both in London, the Senedd building, in Cardiff, and the European Court of Human Rights building, in Strasbourg. He was awarded the RIBA Gold Medal, the Thomas Jefferson Medal, the RIBA Stirling Prize, the Minerva Medal, and the 2007 Pritzker Prize.

==Early life and career==

Richard Rogers was born in Florence, Tuscany, in 1933 into an Anglo-Italian family. His father, William Nino Rogers (1906–1993), was Jewish, and was the cousin of Italian Jewish architect Ernesto Nathan Rogers. His Jewish ancestors moved from Sunderland to Venice in about 1800, later settling in Trieste, Milan and Florence. In October 1938, William Nino Rogers came back to England, having fled Fascist Italy and anti-Jewish laws under Mussolini.

Upon moving to England, Richard Rogers went to St John&#x27;s School, Leatherhead. Rogers did not excel academically, which made him believe that he was &quot;stupid because he could not read or memorise his school work&quot; and as a consequence, he said, he became &quot;very depressed&quot;. He could not read until he was 11, and it was not until after he had his first child that Rogers realised he was dyslexic. After leaving St Johns School, he undertook a foundation course at Epsom School of Art (now the University for the Creative Arts) before going into National Service between 1951 and 1953.

He then attended the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, where he gained the Architectural Association&#x27;s Diploma (AA Dipl) from 1954 until 1959, subsequently graduating with a master&#x27;s degree (M Arch) from the Yale School of Architecture in 1962 on a Fulbright Scholarship. While studying at Yale, Rogers met fellow architecture student Norman Foster and planning student Su Brumwell.

After leaving Yale he joined Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill in New York City. On returning to England in 1963, he, Norman Foster and Brumwell set up architectural practice as Team 4 with Wendy Cheesman (Brumwell later married Rogers, Cheesman married Foster). Rogers and Foster earned a reputation for what was later termed by the media high-tech architecture.

By 1967, Team 4 had split up, but Rogers continued to collaborate with Su Rogers, along with John Young and Laurie Abbott. In early 1968 he was commissioned to design a house and studio for Humphrey Spender near Maldon, Essex, a glass cube framed with I-beams. He continued to develop his ideas of prefabrication and structural simplicity to design a Wimbledon house for his parents. This was based on ideas from his conceptual Zip-Up House.

Rogers subsequently joined forces with Italian architect Renzo Piano, a partnership that was to prove fruitful. His career leapt forward when he, Piano and Gianfranco Franchini won the design competition for the Pompidou Centre in July 1971, alongside a team from Ove Arup that included Irish engineer Peter Rice.

==Later career==
After working with Piano, Rogers established the Richard Rogers Partnership along with Marco Goldschmied, Mike Davies, and John Young in 1977. This became Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners in 2007. The firm maintains offices in London, Shanghai, and Sydney.

Rogers devoted much of his later career to wider issues surrounding architecture, urbanism, sustainability, and the ways in which cities are used. One early illustration of his thinking was an exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1986, entitled &quot;London As It Could Be&quot;, which also featured the work of James Stirling and Rogers&#x27;s former partner Norman Foster. This exhibition made public a series of proposals for transforming a large area of central London, subsequently dismissed as impractical by the city&#x27;s authorities.

In 1995, he became the first architect to deliver the BBC&#x27;s annual Reith Lectures. This series of five talks, titled Sustainable City, were later adapted into the book &quot;Cities for a Small Planet&quot; (Faber and Faber: London 1997, ). The BBC made these lectures available to the public for download in July 2011.

In 1998, he set up the Urban Task Force at the invitation of the British government, to help identify causes of urban decline and establish a vision of safety, vitality, and beauty for Britain&#x27;s cities. This work resulted in a white paper, &quot;Towards an Urban Renaissance&quot;, outlining recommendations for future city designers. Rogers also served for several years as chair of the Greater London Authority panel for Architecture and Urbanism. He was chair of the board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation.

From 2001 to 2008, he was chief advisor on architecture and urbanism to the then Mayor of London Ken Livingstone. In 2008, he was asked to continue on in his role as an advisor by the then new mayor Boris Johnson. He stood down from the post in October 2009. Rogers also served as an advisor to two mayors of Barcelona on urban strategies.

Amidst this extra-curricular activity, Rogers continued to create controversial and iconic works. Perhaps the most famous of these, the Millennium Dome, was designed by the Rogers practice in conjunction with engineering firm Buro Happold and completed in 1999. It was the subject of fierce political and public debate over the cost and contents of the exhibition it contained; the building itself cost £43 million.

In May 2006, Rogers&#x27;s practice was chosen as the architect of Tower 3 of the new World Trade Center in New York City, replacing the old World Trade Center which was destroyed in the September 11 attacks.

Rogers resigned his directorship of Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners on 30 June 2020. The Rogers name was removed from the practice by 2022 as was required by the founding constitution, however the practice was renamed RSHP in June 2022, retaining Rogers&#x27; initial.

===The Richard Rogers Partnership===


===RSHP (previously Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners)===

==Criticisms==

Like Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s and Le Corbusier&#x27;s, some of Rogers&#x27;s buildings have had problems resulting from their design. The Lloyds Buildings&#x27;s much-vaunted design innovation of routing the service pipes outside the walls in fact led to such costs caused by weathering and maintenance that Lloyds considered vacating the building in 2014. Lloyds&#x27;s former chief executive Richard Ward stated: &quot;There is a fundamental problem with this building. Everything is exposed to the elements, and that makes it very costly.&quot;

In 2014 Rogers faced a £5m legal claim over problems at the Oxley Woods estate designed by the firm. Residents complained of water seepage through cladding panels and windows on the prefabricated terraced housing.

==Palestine controversy==
In February 2006, Rogers hosted the inaugural meeting of the campaigning organisation Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine (APJP) in his London offices. At that time his practice had secured a number of projects in New York, including the redevelopment of the Silvercup Studios site, a masterplan for the East River Waterfront and a commission for a $1.7 billion expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Centre in Manhattan. Rogers, however, publicly dissociated himself from the group within weeks, following an outcry from generally pro-Israeli New York voters and politicians, which threatened him with the loss of prestigious commissions including projects in New York and abroad. He announced his withdrawal with the statement, &quot;I unequivocally renounce Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine and have withdrawn my relationship with them.&quot;

==Personal life==
Rogers was married to Ruth Rogers, chef and owner of The River Café restaurant in west London. They had two sons together, Roo and Bo (deceased 2011). Rogers also had three sons, Ben, Zad and Ab, from his first marriage to Su Brumwell. He had fourteen grandchildren and a younger brother, Peter William Rogers, a property developer and co-founder of Stanhope. In 2015, he was named one of the &quot;50 best-dressed British men&quot; by &quot;GQ&quot; magazine.

He died in London on 18 December 2021, at the age of 88.

==Honours and awards==

Rogers was knighted in 1991 by Queen Elizabeth II. He was created Baron Rogers of Riverside, of Chelsea in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea on 17 October 1996. He sat as a Labour peer in the House of Lords; having not attended a proceeding in the 2019–21 session, his membership expired on 11 May 2021. Rogers was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2008 Birthday Honours list. However, he was a republican.

Rogers was awarded the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1985. He was twice honoured by France, first as a Chevalier, L&#x27;Ordre National de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1986, and later as an Officier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1995. He received a Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the 10th Mostra di Architettura di Venezia. In 2006, the Richard Rogers Partnership was awarded the Stirling Prize for Terminal 4 of Barajas Airport, and again in 2009 for Maggie&#x27;s Centre in London. Rogers won the Gold Medal for Architecture at the National Eisteddfod of Wales of 2006 for his work on the Senedd building of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament). He was also appointed an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2005. In 2007 Rogers was made Laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize – architecture&#x27;s highest honour. He was awarded the Minerva Medal by the Chartered Society of Designers in the same year. In 2012, Rogers was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of the last six decades.

Rogers was awarded honorary degrees from several universities, including Alfonso X El Sabio University in Madrid, Oxford Brookes University, the University of Kent, the Czech Technical University in Prague and the Open University. In 1994, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the University of Bath.

==In popular culture==
Rogers is mentioned (along with fellow architect Philip Johnson) in the song &quot;Thru These Architect&#x27;s Eyes&quot; on the album &quot;Outside&quot; (1995) by David Bowie.

Rogers is mentioned in the song &quot;Anti-Everything&quot; by British band Mansun, from the album &quot;Six&quot; (1998).

<text>The Lloyd&#x27;s building (sometimes known as the Inside-Out Building) is the home of the insurance institution Lloyd&#x27;s of London. It is located on the former site of East India House in Lime Street, in London&#x27;s main financial district, the City of London. The building is a leading example of radical Bowellism architecture in which the services for the building, such as ducts and lifts, are located on the exterior to maximise space in the interior.

In 2011, twenty-five years after its completion in 1986 the building received Grade I listing; at this time it was the youngest structure ever to obtain this status. It is said by Historic England to be &quot;universally recognised as one of the key buildings of the modern epoch&quot;. Its innovation of having key service pipes and other components routed outside the walls has led to very expensive maintenance costs due to their exposure to the elements.

==History==
The first Lloyd&#x27;s building (address 12 Leadenhall Street) had been built on this site in 1928 to the design of Sir Edwin Cooper. In 1958, due to expansion of the market, a new building was constructed across the road at 51 Lime Street (now the site of the Willis Building). Lloyd&#x27;s now occupied the Heysham Building and the Cooper Building.

By the 1970s Lloyd&#x27;s had again outgrown these two buildings and proposed to extend the Cooper Building. In 1978, the corporation ran an architectural competition which attracted designs from practices such as Foster Associates, Arup and Ioeh Ming Pei. Lloyd&#x27;s commissioned Richard Rogers to redevelop the site, and the original 1928 building on the western corner of Lime and Leadenhall Streets was demolished to make way for the present one, which was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 18 November 1986. The 1928 building&#x27;s entrance at 12 Leadenhall Street was preserved and forms a rather incongruous attachment to the 1986 structure. Demolition of the 1958 building commenced in 2004 to make way for the 26-storey Willis Building.

The building was previously owned by Dublin based real estate firm Shelbourne Development Group, who purchased it in 2004 from a German investment bank. In July 2013 it was sold to the Chinese company Ping An Insurance in a £260 million deal.

In 2008 the Twentieth Century Society called for the building to be Grade I listed and in 2011 it was granted this status.

==Design==
=== Features ===
The current Lloyd&#x27;s building (address 1 Lime Street) was designed by the architect company Richard Rogers &amp; Partners and built between 1978 and 1986. Bovis was the management contractor. Like the Pompidou Centre in Paris (designed by Renzo Piano and Rogers), the building was innovative in having its services such as staircases, lifts, ductwork, electrical power conduits and water pipes on the outside, leaving an uncluttered space inside. The 12 glass lifts were the first of their kind in the United Kingdom. Like the Pompidou Centre, the building was highly influenced by the work of Archigram in the 1950s and 1960s.

Rogers selects primarily concrete and some steel for the structure, utilizing materials appropriate to the site&#x27;s local logistics. Additionally, Rogers emphasizes that contemporary buildings incorporate both current and historical technologies.

The building consists of three main towers and three service towers around a central, rectangular space. Its core is the large Underwriting Room on the ground floor, which houses the Lutine Bell within the Rostrum. Also on the first floor is the loss book which for 300 years has had entries of significant losses entered by quill. The Underwriting Room (often simply called &quot;the Room&quot;) is overlooked by galleries, forming a high atrium lit naturally through a huge barrel-vaulted glass roof. The first four galleries open onto the atrium space, and are connected by escalators through the middle of the structure. The higher floors are glassed in and can only be reached via the exterior lifts.

The 11th floor houses the Committee Room (also known as the Adam Room), an 18th-century dining room designed for the 2nd Earl of Shelburne by Robert Adam in 1763; it was transferred piece by piece from the previous (1958) Lloyd&#x27;s building across the road at 51 Lime Street.

The Lloyd&#x27;s building is to the roof, with 14 floors. On top of each service core stand the cleaning cranes, increasing the overall height to . Modular in plan, each floor can be altered by addition or removal of partitions and walls.

=== Criticism ===
Prince Charles and others initially criticized the design of Lloyd&#x27;s Building, similar to the backlash of Centre Pompidou. Rogers stated that, &quot;Lloyds said they wanted two things: they wanted a building that would last into the next century – we made that one – and they wanted a building that would meet their changing needs.&quot; One of those changing needs relates to the much-vaunted design innovation of having the service pipes, ducts, and stairwells outside the walls led to such costs caused by weathering and maintenance that Lloyds considered vacating the building in 2014. 
Lloyd&#x27;s former chief executive Richard Ward stated: &quot;There is a fundamental problem with this building. Everything is exposed to the elements, and that makes it very costly.&quot;

<doc id="486226" wikidata="Q4910388" url="?curid=486226" title="Bill Oakley (comics)">
<text>William Douglas Oakley (April 1, 1964 – February 16, 2004) was a letterer for numerous comic books from Marvel, DC, and other companies. His most prominent works include the first two volumes of Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; and &quot;&quot; #1-11, #15-37.

==Biography==
Oakley attended The Kubert School in Dover, New Jersey for a year, intending to be a comics artist. However, his experience at the school convinced him that he couldn&#x27;t handle the workload of a comic book artist and, still desiring to work in the comics field, decided to do lettering instead. In July 1986 he started on staff at Marvel, working under Jim Novak. For Marvel, Oakley lettered &quot;Avengers&quot; for a long time, &quot;Avengers West Coast&quot;, the &quot;X-Men&quot;, the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; during Walt Simonson’s run, &quot;Rampaging Hulk,&quot; and &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot;.

Oakley concluded a late 1987 interview by remarking &quot;I would hope, by this time next year, that I would have enough work that I could go freelance. I wouldn&#x27;t mind the idea of working at home. That kind of appeals to me, not having to get up at 6:00 every morning to commute here. That I &quot;definitely&quot; would look forward to.&quot; Oakley indeed went freelance by the end of 1988. For DC, he worked on a number of the Superman titles, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Lobo&quot;, &quot;DC vs. Marvel Comics&quot;, &quot;Batman: Gotham Knights&quot;, &quot;Justice Society&quot;, and &quot;Hawkman&quot;.

=== Death ===
Due to the fact that he did not possess medical insurance (&quot;because he had a previous medical condition and the insurance companies refused to cover him&quot;), he was forced to letter comics from his hospital bed to pay bills before he died of cancer in Utica, New York. His hometown was Oneonta, New York. Oakley was survived by his wife Leslie and son Stephen.

He was halfway through designing &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot; at the time of his death. The final volume (finished by Todd Klein) was dedicated to his memory, with Moore noting in the introduction to the book that he felt the cancer made Oakley&#x27;s lettering style much better than a non-cancer-addled letterer.

== Lettering style ==
Oakley had a distinctive but understated lettering style. One of his trademarks as a letterer was to often erase or omit panel borders when they touched the top, side, or bottom of a word balloon or caption, thus opening up the balloon/caption to the gutter. In this regard, Oakley&#x27;s lettering style was similar to John Workman&#x27;s. Also like Workman, even in the age of computer lettering, Oakley did all this lettering by hand, using a Hunt 107 pen. Before the age of computer lettering, unlike Jim Novak and others, Oakley was one of the few letterers to continue to create word balloons entirely freehand instead of using templates.

==Awards==
*2000: Nominated for &quot;Favorite Letterer&quot; Wizard Fan Award, for &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume I&quot;
*2002: Nominated for &quot;Favorite Letterer&quot; Wizard Fan Award, for &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II&quot;
*2004: Nominated for &quot;Best Lettering&quot; Eisner Award, for &quot;Hawkman&quot;, &quot;JSA&quot;, &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II&quot; and &quot;Sleeper&quot;

<text>Konrad von Marburg (sometimes anglicised as Conrad of [[Marburg]]) (1180 – 30 July 1233) was a medieval German Catholic priest, inquisitor and nobleman. He is perhaps best known as the spiritual director of Elizabeth of Hungary.

==Life==
Konrad&#x27;s early life is not well known, he may be of aristocratic descent, most likely the son of Konrad I. a Ministerial family of Marburg, And corroberates with contemporary church sources describing him as well-educated and highly knowledgeable.

He was called &quot;magister&quot;, a proof that he had finished the course of studies at a university, maybe Paris or Bologna. He was noted for his strong asceticism and his oppressive zeal in defending the church.

Much of his early work within the church was related to the suppression of heresy, and he took an active part in the Albigensian Crusade in southern France. Pope Innocent III, who championed the Medieval Inquisition, was one of Konrad&#x27;s early supporters. Eventually, however, Konrad returned to Germany, the land of his birth. In particular, Konrad was employed by Louis&#x27; wife, Elizabeth of Hungary, to whom Konrad acted as spiritual director.

After receiving a commission from the Archbishop of Mainz, Siegfried II, Konrad set to work seeking out heresy in both Thuringia and Hesse, and quickly gained a reputation for being unreasonable and unjust. According to most accounts, Konrad accepted almost any accusation as true, and regarded suspects as guilty until proven innocent. Those accused of being heretics were quickly sought out by Konrad&#x27;s mobs, and told to repent or else be burnt at the stake. Those accused of heresy were also encouraged to denounce others, with the implication that their own lives might be spared if they did so. Konrad included commoners, nobles and priests in his inquisition: Heinrich Minnike, Provost of Goslar, was one of Konrad&#x27;s first targets, and was burnt at the stake. In one instance, he treated his penitent with extreme harshness, tricking a widow into some unwitting disobedience and then had her and her maids flogged.

In 1231, Pope Gregory IX granted him permission to ignore standard church procedure for the investigation of heresy. The pope also issued the papal bull &quot;Vox in Rama&quot; in response to Konrad&#x27;s allegations, condemning &quot;Luciferian.&quot; Konrad teamed up with Conrad Dorso and John the One-Eyed in the Upper Rhineland, burning many heretics with barely the semblance of a trial.

In 1233, Konrad accused Henry II, Count of Sayn, of taking part in &quot;Satanic orgies&quot;. Henry, however, appealed to an assembly of bishops in Mainz where they decided to postpone a verdict to the discontent of both parties.

==Death==

Konrad refused to accept the decision and demanded that a verdict be reached, but eventually gave up and left Mainz to return to Marburg. On the road, he was attacked by several knights, who killed both Konrad and his assistant, a Franciscan friar named Gerhard Lutzelkolb.

After Konrad&#x27;s death, Pope Gregory declared Konrad to have been an upholder of the Christian faith and ordered his killers punished. Perceptions in the German Empire however, were markedly less favorable, and the memory of Konrad was enough to turn opinion against the Italian Inquisition for many years. The reputation he amassed in the course of his years as an inquisitor, gradually spread throughout Europe, overcoming the local boundaries of his original area of activity; and was that of an overly harsh judge. He left an &quot;Epistola ad papam de miraculis Sanctae Elisabethae,&quot; which was first published at Cologne in 1653.

The place where Konrad was killed, Hof Kapelle near Marburg, is marked with a stone (within the premises of a private farm); it was locally long believed to be haunted and is allegedly today, on certain days, the site of black rites.

==Popular culture==

* Konrad appears in a work by the English novelist Charles Kingsley, who wrote his &quot;Saint&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; about Elisabeth.
* Konrad von Marburg is pictured as the main character in the French comic strip &quot;The Third Testament&quot; by Xavier Dorison and Alex Alice. After hiding for 20 years after being sentenced to death by an Inquisition Tribunal framed by Henry of Sayn, a mellowed and weary Konrad again faces the mysterious Count of Sayn in a race to find a legendary document, the “Third Testament”. The story is a 4-part suite published by Glénat.
* Konrad von Marburg appears as an antagonist in the anime series &quot;Radiant&quot;.

<doc id="486244" wikidata="Q239577" url="?curid=486244" title="Ibibio people">
<text>The Ibibio people ( ) are a coastal people in Southern Nigeria. They are mostly found in Akwa Ibom, Cross River, and the Eastern part of Abia State. During the colonial period in Nigeria, the Ibibio Union asked for recognition by the British as a sovereign nation.

The Annang, Ekid, Oron and Ibeno share personal names, culture, and traditions with the Ibibio, and speak closely related varieties (dialects) of Ibibio which are more or less mutually intelligible. The Ekpo and societies are a significant part of the Ibibio political system. They use a variety of masks to execute social control. Body art plays a major role in Ibibio art.

==Origin and history==

The predominant paternal haplogroup among the Ibibio is E1b1a1-M2. The ancestors of the Ibibio originally came from Northeast Africa and moved around the Green Sahara. The gradual movement of the Proto Ibibio to the Cross River Region may have been associated with the expansion of Sahel agriculture in the African Neolithic period, following the desiccation of the Sahara in c. 3500 BCE.

The Ibibio people are reputed to be one of the earliest inhabitants of southern Nigeria. It is estimated that they arrived at their present home around 1000 B.C. In spite of the historical account, it is not clear when the Ibibio arrived at the state.

According to some scholars, they might have come from the central Benue Valley, particularly, the Jukun influence in the old Calabar at some historical time period. Another pointer is the widespread use of the manila, a popular currency used by the Jukuns. Coupled with this, is the Jukun southern drive to the coast which appears to have been recently compared with the formation of Akwa Ibom settlements in their present location.

The most accepted version of Ibibio history described that the Cameroon will offer a more concise explanation of their origin. This was corroborated by oral testimonies by field workers who say that the core Ibibio people were of the Afaha lineage whose original home was Usak Edet in the Cameroons. The Uşak Edet (Isanguele) are a subgroup of the Ekoi people (the Ejagham). This was premised on the fact that among the Ibibio people, Usak Edet is popularly known as Edit Afaha (Afaha&#x27;s Creek) which reflects the fact that Ibibio people originated from Usak Edet.

After the first bulk of the people arrived in what later became Nigeria, they settled first in Uruan. Sections of the Ibibio people then migrated westwards, eastwards, southwards and northwards. The northern clans of the Ibibio people settled at Ibom. It is believed that this clan of the Ibibio were the aboriginal people of Ibom settlement. The settlement, located in present day Arochukwu, is said to have been founded by their forefather, &quot;Ibom&quot;, after whom they named the village. They settled there for a very long time and worshiped the God of the Sky called &quot;Abasi Ibom enyon&quot;. They also worshiped Ibini Ukpabi (Ibritam). As a result of clashes with the Igbo people who were moving southward, culminating in the Ibibio War which took place about 1630 and 1720 A.D., they left Ibom Kingdom and moved to the present day Ibibioland. Some village settlements had already been established in their current location alongside the Ibom.

Following the Aro-Igbo-Ibibio war of 1550 A.D, the Ibibio&#x27;s moved southward and found a virgin and empty land, their present place. The Ibibio first settled in Ikono from where they migrated or dispersed to further places becoming the aboriginal people of the present Ibibio lands. It is at this juncture that Ikono Ibom moved to Ikot Oku Ikono village now in the Uyo Local Government Area, which is referred to as Ikono Ibom Uyo, a clan carved out of the main Ikono Ibom. Iman Ibom moved to Ekom Iman, now in Etinan Local Government Area and Nsit Ibom moved to Afia Nsit now in Nsit Ibom. The three regard themselves as blood brothers and children of .

The three children of &quot;Ibom&quot; upon their final settlement, Etefia who is the principal actor in Ikono Ibom Uyo clan, settled in Ikot Oku Ikono and founded the Ikono Anyaan and Ikot Ekpeyak Ikono are stock and children of Ikono Ibom, they have shared and similar social, traditional and cultural Milieu. 

Ekom Iman is a place which Iman Ibom settled and planted the Ekom tree (coula edulis) from which the name of the settlement is derived, Ekom (coula edulis) planted by Iman one of the sons of Ibom. Iman had children and some of them migrated to expand the Iman Ibom clan such villages like Ikot Obioinyang, Afagha Effiate and the entire Iman Ibom clan.

Upon the death of Iman Ibom, his spirit metamorphose into the Iman Ibom clan deity “The Itina Iman deity” and oyot is the clan deity – totem hence it is a taboo to kill or eat such mythical beast and Ebre is the totem of Ikono Ibom clan, they forbid the killing or maiming of this mythical animal. Nsit Ibom moved to Afia Nsit where there was water and settled there, and his children spread to Mbak Nsit and other places of that clan.

The Nsit Ibom totem is Iyak Anyan – the Anyan Nsit deity. They all have shared a similar characteristics of social, traditional as well as cultural Milieu and formed the center of this study. The brothers settled close to each other and formed pact and ally or an affinity with each other and had children and devised a thoroughgoing mechanism for self-rule, maintenance of law and order, and effective political organization: Using some elements of culture and socio-religious organizations such as Ekpo, Ebre, Ibaan Isong, Ekong, Ikpa—udoh and many others to enforce law and order and to put the masses of the population under control.

==Ibibio Groups==
*Enyong: Northern Ibibio 
*Eket: Southern Ibibio 
*Annang: Western Ibibio 
*Ibiono: Eastern Ibibio 
*Uruan: Riverside Ibibio

==Geography==
The Ibibio people are found predominantly in Akwa Ibom State and are related to the Annang community, the Ibibio community and the Eket, although other groups usually understand the Ibibio language.

Because of the larger population of the Ibibio people, they hold political control over Akwa Ibom State, but the government is shared with the Annangs, Eket and Oron. The political system follows the traditional method of consensus. Even though elections are held, practically, the political leaders are pre-discussed in a manner that is benefiting to all.

===Location of Ibibioland===

The Ibibio people are located in eastern part of South-South Nigeria. Prior to the existence of Nigeria as a nation, the Ibibio people were self-governed.

Ibibio people and their brothers (the Annang, Oron and Eket) were part of the enclave called &quot;Bight of Biafra&quot; before the British creation of Eastern Nigeria. The Ibibio people became a part of the Eastern Nigeria of Nigeria under British colonial rule.

During the Nigerian Civil War, the Eastern region was split into three states. The then-Southeastern State of Nigeria was where the Ibibio were located, it was created from the original twelve states of Nigeria after Nigerian independence.

The &quot;Southeastern State&quot; was later renamed Cross River State. On 23 September 1987, by Military Decree No.24, Akwa Ibom State was carved out of the then Cross Rivers State as a separate state. Cross Rivers State remains as a neighboring and mothering state of Akwa Ibom State.

Southwestern Cameroon was a part of the present Cross River State and Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria. During the then Eastern Region of Nigeria, parts were partitioned united with Cameroon in a 1961 plebiscite. This resulted in the Ibibio and Annang being divided between Nigeria and Cameroon.

However, the leadership of the Northern Region of Nigeria was able to keep the &quot;Northwestern section&quot; during the plebiscite that is now today&#x27;s Nigerian Adamawa and Taraba States.

==Demographics==

Ibibio people are found in all Nigerian states and is one of the Nigerian ethnic group living outside of Nigeria after Yoruba and Igbo. Hence, significant number of Ibibio people reside in Europe and North America as well as other countries. In addition to their state of origin, Akwa Ibom State, significant number of Ibibio are found in:

*Lagos State, Nigeria
*Rivers State, Nigeria
*Abia state, Nigeria
*Bayelsa state, Nigeria
*Benue state, Nigeria
*Bioko, Equatorial Guinea
*Western Cameroon
*Ghana
*Brazil
*Cuba
*Jamaica
*United Kingdom
*Canada
*United States of America

==Political system==
Traditionally Ibibio society consists of communities that are made up of large families with blood affinity each ruled by their constitutional and religious head, known as the . The Obong Ikpaisong ruled with the (&#x27;head of the families&#x27;), which together with the heads of the cults and societies constitute the or (&#x27;traditional council, shrine, or court&#x27;). The decisions of the Obong Ikpaisong were enforced by members of the Ekpo or Obon society who act as messengers of the spirits and the military and police of the community. The chief will send masked individuals to confront a rule-breaker if the need arises.

Ekpo members Ekpo Masquerades are always masked when performing their policing duties. Although their identities are almost always known, fear of retribution from the ancestors prevents most people from accusing those members who overstep their social boundaries, effectively committing police brutality. Membership is open to all Ibibio males, but one must have access to wealth to move into the politically influential grades. The main purpose of Ekpo is to protect its people and act as a defense against potential attackers. They are concerned with issues and emergencies that pertain to the safety of the town as a whole. In addition, it serves as an outlet for men to productively use energy to benefit everyone.

In the months of June through December, the Ekpo society plays a large role in the community&#x27;s life. Many activities such as farming, shopping, and obtaining food and water are prohibited on days in which the masks are out and being performed. Crimes also carry heavier consequences during this time period. While the punishments are lighter today, a person caught stealing during the days of the Ekpo season in the 1940s would be killed by members of the Ekpo. It is known as a secret society despite the fact that the purpose and activities are widely known by the village. This is due to the fact that everyone must abide by certain laws during Ekpo season. The most important secrets are a series of code words and dance steps taught to initiates and used by members. Knowing these secrets allows members to travel freely during the season, and being caught traveling without knowing the secret terms and dance will result in being arrested.

Prior to the gradual abolition of slavery in Nigeria by British colonial authorities beginning in the mid-1880s, Ibibio society ranked people, in descending order, as freeborn (&quot;amanisong&quot;), strangers or later immigrants (&quot;ududung&quot;), and slaves (&quot;ifn&quot;). Slaves were purchased in slave markets or captured through intergroup wars. Often people gave themselves or their children up as slaves when they could no longer provide for themselves or their families. Slaves were used as offerings in regular ritual human sacrifice, and through the mid-19th century, slaves were also slaughtered by the hundreds upon the death of important chiefs, with the belief that they would serve the deceased chief in the afterlife.

==Religion==
===Pre-colonial era===
Ibibio religion (Inam) was of two dimensions, which centered on the pouring of libation, sacrifice, worship, consultation, communication and invocation of the God of Heaven (Abasi Enyong), God of the Earth (Abasi Isong) and the Supreme Being (Abasi Ibom) by the Constitutional and Religious King/Head of a particular Ibibio Community who was known from the ancient times as the Obong-Ikpaisong (the word &#x27;Obong Ikpaisong&#x27; directly interpreted means &quot;King of the Principalities of the Earth&#x27; or &#x27;King of the Earth and the Principalities&#x27; or Traditional Ruler&quot;).

The second dimension of Ibibio Religion centered on the worship, consultation, invocation, sacrifice, appeasement, etc. of the God of the Heaven (Abasi Enyong) and the God of the Earth (Abasi Isong) through various invisible or spiritual entities (me Ndem) of the various Ibibio Division such as Atakpo Ndem Uruan Inyang, Etefia Ikono, Awa Itam, etc. The Priests of these Deities (me Ndem) were the Temple Chief Priests/Priestesses of the various Ibibio Divisions. A particular Ibibio Division could consist of many interrelated autonomous communities or kingdoms ruled by an autonomous Priest-King called Obong-Ikpaisong, assisted by heads of the various large families (Mbong Ekpuk) which make up the Community.

These have been the ancient political and religious system of Ibibio people from time immemorial. Tradition, interpreted in Ibibio Language, is &#x27;Ikpaisong&#x27;. Tradition (Ikpaisong) in Ibibio Custom embodies the Religious and Political System. The word &#x27;Obong&#x27; in Ibibio language means &#x27;Ruler, King, Lord, Chief, Head&#x27; and is applied depending on the Office concern. In reference to the Obong-Ikpaisong, the word &#x27;Obong&#x27; means &#x27;King&#x27;. In reference to the Village Head, the word means &#x27;Chief&#x27;. In reference to the Head of the Families (Obong Ekpuk), the word means &#x27;Head&#x27; In reference to God, the word means &#x27;Lord&#x27;. In reference to the Head of the various societies - e.g. &#x27;Obong Obon&#x27;, the word means &#x27;Head or Leader&#x27;.

====Sacred lands (Akai)====
Scattered throughout each village were sacred lands, akai (forest). They were called akai because no one was permitted to clear them for cultivation. All burial grounds, shrines for the village deities and spots for secret societies such as Ekpo Onyoho, Ekoong, Idiong, Ekong, were sacred. Everything in these places were equally sacred. Non-members of the secret societies were not permitted to enter the spots set aside for such secret societies, even for the collection of firewood, sticks, fruits (like mkpook), vegetables (like afang and odusa) or snails, or to hunt the animals which abounded in the forests. The explanation is simple. If non-members were allowed to enter any secret society akai they might in due course discover the secrets of their time-honoured society, and wicked people might even desecrate the graves of their ancestors hence the ban.

====The Soul and life after death====
Like many Ibibio words, (&#x27;soul&#x27;) has four meanings. First, ethereal body, secondly, soul, thirdly, spirit, and fourthly, over-soul; the last always lives in the house of Abasi Ibom and it is quite separate from the individuality which between incarnations stays in the country of the dead. Though over-soul and spirit are combined, much of the Spirit is contained in that portion of the ego which is incarnated.

According to Talbot, it is the soul proper that spends part of its time as a were-animal or in a bush-beast in the forest or water and is called Ukpong Ikot, or bush-soul. The shadow is not thought to be connected with the ethereal body but to be an emanation of the soul and therefore to be directly affected by any action on it. The majority of the Ibibio believe that a person&#x27;s soul can be invoked into his shadow, which is made to appear in a basin of water. The shadow is then speared, his blood is seen in the water in the basin and the man dies.

The Ibibio believe that after death the same kind of existence is led as during life on earth; for example, farmers, blacksmiths, hunters, and fishermen will continue with their former occupations while social intercourse and amusements will also proceed as before. The scenery, houses, crops and animals of the next world have the same appearance as in this world but only those beasts, plants and foodstuffs which have been sacrificed in honour of the dead are transported there. The land of the dead, like that of the living, is believed to be divided into various countries, towns, villages and lineages where different communities of people live as on earth. At death every man goes to the particular part inhabited by his people.

====Obot and essien emana====
;Obot (&#x27;nature&#x27;)
The Ibibio believe in , that is, the individual creation of persons by God. If someone is wild, they say he was created that way; if he is kind, again that is how he was created by God to be; if he is poor or rich, that was his lot, and so on; effectively, there was nothing anyone could do to alter his lot, for he was moulded that way.

;Essien emana (&#x27;destiny&#x27;)
The Ibibio also believe in the same way in destiny, or . For instance, if a person died accidentally, this was how he had died in his previous incarnation and therefore he had to die that way. If he was rich, he was so in his previous incarnation and must be so now; if he was brilliant, that was how he was destined to be, etc. He could, however, reverse the situation if he consulted the Mbia Idiong, who alone could tell him what to do. The diviners could help him pin-point what it was he had done in his previous incarnation which was affecting his present life. They could then prescribe to him what to do to remedy the worsening situation. If the instructions were strictly followed, the position could be reversed, they believed. For instance, if a person had no issue a diviner might tell him that he had killed innocent children in his previous incarnation, and that the parents of the deceased and the general public had cursed him, saying that he would not have any issue and would continue to kill innocent children throughout his incarnations unless he gave certain things as sacrificial offerings. When the Mbia Idiong told him what the things were and he had offered them as sacrifices to Mother Earth, the Ibibio believed the situation would be reversed; otherwise, he would remain childless.

===Colonial and post-colonial eras===
The Ibibio were introduced to Christianity through the work of early missionaries in the nineteenth century. Samuel Bill started his work at Ibeno. He established the Qua Iboe Church which later spread places in the middle belt of Nigeria. Later, other churches were also introduced e.g. The Apostolic church. Independent churches such as Deeper Life Bible Church, came into the area in the second part of the twentieth century. Today Ibibio people are predominantly Christian.

===The Bible in the Ibibio language===
History was made on the 27th day of August 2020 that the first-ever Ibibio Bible translation was presented at Ibom Hall in Uyo, the capital of Akwa Ibom. Published by the 200-year-old, American based International Bible Society (Biblica), the publishers of the NIV Version.

The Ibibio Bible was translated by Ibibio professors, including Professors Margaret Mary Okon, Bassey Okon, Eno-Abasi Urua, Inimbom Akpan, Udo Etuk, as well as Dr. Paulinus Noah, Dr. Effiong Ekpenyong and Rev. Fr. Dr. Donatus Udoette, a theologian who is well versed in Greek.

==Arts and culture==
=== Masks ===

The masks and accoutrements of the Ekpo society make up the greatest works of art in Ibibio society. Ibibio often purposefully play with proportions in their masks to distort the face. A component that appears often in Ibibio masks is an articulated lower jaw. Ibibio people have an overarching theme of contrasting male and female masks by using dark and light colors respectively. These masks are not always performed together, but there is a general understanding of their opposing relationship. Feminine masks are decorated with light colors such as white. Their features are delicate to emphasize their femininity. On the other hand, masculine masks use dark colors to represent the mystic forces of the forest. These masks often have large features and are created to be intentionally ugly. They achieve this by distorting the features in unnatural manners such as having bulging eyes or misplaced mouths. Many deformities present in the masks come from naturally occurring human diseases and illnesses. One that is often depicted is , a part of yaws. Signs of baldness and walking sticks also show up often in order to portray symbols of karma and old age. Men&#x27;s costumes incorporate natural materials from the wilderness such as raffia, and seed pod rattles. Women&#x27;s costumes use materials such as light colored cloth to represent the order of living in the village.

==== Ekpo ====
The masks of the Ekpo societies were used to elicit fear and execute social control. The most common type of mask is one made for the face with waist-length raffia attached. The effect of the masks and their intimidating quality is part of what gives them their power, in addition to the long history of the Ekpo. To put on an Ekpo mask is to surrender earthly identity and assume an ancestral one. Masks used may be ones owned by deceased ancestors, ones made to look like ancestors, or ones made to resemble to village heroes. Many are carved from lightweight wood called &quot;ukot&quot; (palm wine tree). This makes them easier to wear and move around in. For additional support, the mask is secured to the wearer&#x27;s head with a rope, and a horizontal piece of wood may be inserted into the mask in order to bite into. In addition to the raffia on the mask itself, performers also wear a knee-length raffia skirt. The lower legs, arms, and hands are painted with charcoal. New raffia is added to the mask each season, and is displayed in the off-season in a family or village shrine.

=== Ikot Ekpene ===
The Ibibio are known for their woodcarvings, raffia-weavings, and pottery making. Ikot Ekpene is a town in Nigeria known for its marketplace in which crafts are sold to both tourists and middle-class Nigerians. While the Ibibio are not known for metalworking, there is a significant number of craftspeople making this type of art to be sold.
Most metalwork objects produced have a practical purpose rather than a decorative one. Despite this, Ibibio coffins tend to be highly decorative. They feature ornamental painted metal motifs, colorful plastic sheets, and glass panels on the sides.

Many people who carve Ekpo masks live in Ikot Ekpene.

=== Body adornment ===
Both temporary and permanent body modifications are used. Rhythm and nature are both considerable motifs at play in the designs. Hairdressing, body painting, and body modification are the main focus of body art performed by the Ibibio. Intentional fattening of young women is another culturally important aspect of the Ibibio.

==== Body painting ====
In painting, the goal is to emphasize rather than obscure the wearer&#x27;s face or other parts of the body. The symbol of the dot plays a key role in the understanding of beauty. Okon Umetuk in his article &quot;Body Art in Ibibio Culture&quot;, states that;A &#x27;dot&#x27; is regarded as the only perfect mark to indicate and summarize beauty in Ibibio culture.Evidence of this is found in the abundance of dots that appear on the faces and bodies of decorated individuals. An &#x27;X&#x27; symbol may be applied to the forehead, wrists, and ankles as a way to mark mediation. When worn by a diviner, it may mark a connection with himself and the gods as well as his people. Members of a ritual may wear it to symbolize peace, humility, as well as acceptance.

&quot;Odung&quot; is a type of body painting that is used for events such as marriage, childbirth, coming-of-age, and death. It may also be used to show a man&#x27;s status in the Ekpo society. This process is commonly used among women. It is often done after the birth of a child. The stains that are left afterwards can stay on the skin for up to three months. Professionals are typically the ones who paint others, and the process may take from five to eight hours to complete.

&quot;Iduot&quot; is another form of body painting which symbolizes fertility. The pigment is taken from crushed camwood and then added to water which produces a red substance. People&#x27;s palms, feet, legs, and faces are decorated with the pigment. The Ibibio use it partially for its bleaching effect. After continuous usage, it produces a smooth and light skin complexion.

Modern versions of face and body decoration such as eye shadow, lipstick, and eyeliner are used by contemporary Ibibio people. Body decoration has a long history in the Ibibio and these products help their cultural expression in a convenient way, but are not a new form of expression. Substances such as the were used for eyelid decoration long before modern eye shadow. As in many other cultures around the world, Ibibio women generally put heavy emphasis on the eye when it comes to make-up.

==== Hairstyles ====
Hair styles are another way for the Ibibio to symbolically mark certain occasions. Styles of hair in Ibibioland include both elaborate braiding with and without the use of thread. Some styles are symbolic of stories or events that have occurred in the wearer&#x27;s life. If a married woman has unkempt hair, this indicates that someone she is close to, typically her husband, a child, or another relative, has died. Other styles may be indicative of age, marital status, or social standing. There also exists hairstyles without any meaning that are simply worn for fashion purposes.

==Ibibio tribes and ethnic groups==

The Ibibio are divided into the following subcultural groups: Eastern Ibibio or Ibibio Proper; Western Ibibio or Annang; Northern Ibibio or Enyong; Southern Ibibio or Eket and Riverine Ibibio or Uruan.

<doc id="486245" wikidata="Q1133189" url="?curid=486245" title="Japanese mobile phone culture">
<text>In Japan, mobile phones became ubiquitous years before the phenomenon spread worldwide. In Japanese, mobile phones are called , literally &quot;portable telephones,&quot; and are often known simply as &quot;keitai&quot; (携帯).

A majority of the Japanese population own cellular phones, most of which are equipped with enhancements such as video and camera capabilities. As of 2018, 65% of the population owned such devices. This pervasiveness and the particularities of their usage has led to the development of a mobile phone culture, or &quot;keitai culture,&quot; which especially in the early stages of mobile phone adoption was distinct from the rest of the world.

==Features==

Japan was a leader in mobile phone technology. The first commercial camera phone was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP-210, released in Japan in May 1999. The first mass-market camera phone was the J-SH04, a Sharp J-Phone model sold in Japan in November 2000. It could instantly transmit pictures via cell phone telecommunication. The J-Phone (Stylized as 写メール, which stands for Photo-Mail) model not only included a camera, but also the function to send photographs via messaging or e-mail, which made the phone extremely popular at the time. Technologies like 3G mobile broadband were common in Japan before any other country.

Some of the main features of a mobile phone in Japan are:
* E-mail
* Configurable databases
* Phone and address books
* Alarm clocks and stopwatches
* Live video feed via Piconet
* Mobile games (e.g. RPGs like &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; or &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series)
* Timers
* Camera phone features (e.g. selfie, front-facing camera) with mandatory shutter sound. This is because taking upskirt shots of schoolgirls on subway is a problem in Japan. 
* Image enhancement capabilities, such as the option to add borders, create animations, and more.
* Instant messengers
* Emoji
* Calculator, calendar, schedule notes and memo pad
* Audio recording
* Portable music player (MP3 player, etc.)
* Portable video player (MP4 player, etc.)
* Online video viewing (Flash, YouTube, Nico Nico Douga etc.)
* Video calling
* GPS navigation
* Television (1seg) and radio (FM/AM) access
* Video-on-demand (VOD) content
* Theft prevention buzzer (with automatic reporting system to the police)
* Pedometer
* &#x27;Read aloud&#x27; system
* Touch-pad system
* A fingerprint/face recognition system for the protection of personal data
* Mobile centrex service with wireless LAN
In recent years, some cellular phones have been updated to be used as debit or credit cards and can be swiped through most cash registers to buy products as varied as mascara and jet planes, as more and more companies offer catalogs for cell phones. These functionalities include:
* E-money service and various certification functions through Untouched IC card (FeliCa etc.)
* Various services with NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s ‘Osaifu-Keitai (mobile phone with wallet function)’
* E-money service e.g. ‘Edy’
* ‘Mobile Suica,’ allows the phone to be used as a rail ticket
* Cmode: vending machines which can be used with QR Codes &#x27;Osaifu-Keitai&#x27;
* NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s service (information about traffic, food, shopping etc.) by GPS
Some newer models allow the user to watch movies and/or television. Most phones can be connected to the Internet through services such as i-mode. Japan was also the first to launch 3G services on a large scale. Users can browse text-only Internet sites, and many Japanese sites have sub-sites designed especially for cellular phone users. One of the most popular services allows users to check train schedules and plan trips on public transit.

The wide variety of features, many original to or limited to Japan, lead to the term &quot;Galápagos syndrome&quot;, as these resulting phones were dominant in the island nation of Japan, but unsuccessful abroad. This has since led to the term to refer to Japanese feature phones, by contrast with newer smart phones.

==Market==
, the Japanese mobile phone market is broadly divided into a high-end, consisting of smartphones (, abbreviated as or ); mid-range, consisting of feature phones (); and a low-end, consisting of Personal Handy-phone System (PHS, or , from ). There is some overlap of market segments between low-end smartphones and high-end feature phones, and many shared features. PHS, which was initially developed as a cheaper alternative to 2G networks such as CDMA and GSM, was initially deployed in 1995, but is now only offered by one carrier, Y!Mobile (part of SoftBank). As elsewhere in the world, smartphones have been growing rapidly.

==In use==
The use of mobile phones to make calls on public transport is frowned upon, and messages asking passengers not to make calls and to switch their phones to silent mode (&quot;public mode&quot; or &quot;manner mode&quot; in Japanese) are played frequently. This, combined with the low per-message price and ample allowed length per message (10,000 characters), has increased the use of text messaging as an alternative to calls. Abbreviations are also widespread. &#x27;\&#x27; may be attached at the end of a sentence to show that they are not happy about the event described. A sentence like &quot;I have a test today\&quot; (translated) could be used to imply that the student did not study enough, or that the test itself invites negative emotion. Some of these usages disappeared as suitable emoji were made, but these newly made icons also acquired a usage not originally intended. One example deals with the astrological symbol for Libra (♎). It resembles a cooked and puffed mochi, and is sometimes used in a Happy New Year&#x27;s message as mochi are often eaten then. The symbol for Aquarius (♒) resembles waves, so this would be used to mean &#x27;sea&#x27;. The number of icons gradually increased and they are now coloured on most cell phones, to make them more distinct. ASCII art is also used widely and many of them are faces with expressions. &quot;(see also Shift JIS art)&quot;

==Emoji==

Emoji, originating on Japanese mobile phones in 1997, became increasingly popular worldwide in the 2010s after being added to several mobile operating systems. They are now considered to be a large part of popular culture in the West.

The SkyWalker DP-211SW, a mobile telephone manufactured by J-Phone which supported a set of 90 emoji, was the first phone known to contain a set of emojis as part of its typeface, dating back to 1997. The J-Phone DP-211SW didn&#x27;t sell well due to its high retail price, and therefore mass-market adoption of emoji didn&#x27;t take place at the time. J-Phone later became Vodafone Japan and is now SoftBank Mobile; a later, expanded version of the SoftBank emoji set was the basis for the emoji selection available on early iPhones.

A highly influential early set of 176 cellular emoji was created by Shigetaka Kurita in 1999, and deployed on NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s i-mode, a Mobile web platform. They were intended to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services. According to interviews, he took inspiration from Japanese manga where characters are often drawn with symbolic representations called &quot;manpu&quot; (such as a water drop on a face representing nervousness or confusion), and weather pictograms used to depict the weather conditions at any given time. It included the Face with Tears of Joy emoji, which represents a Japanese visual style commonly found in manga and anime, combined with &quot;kaomoji&quot; and smiley elements. An additional 76 emoji, besides the 176 basic emoji, were added in phones supporting C-HTML 4.0.

===Gyaru-moji===
One very distinct form of writing is called &#x27;gyaru-moji (&#x27;gal characters&#x27; named after the fashion style &#x27;gyaru&#x27; or &#x27;gal&#x27; because the people of this fashion style are the ones who often use this kind of lettering). For example, &quot;lt&quot; wouldn&#x27;t correspond to the Latin characters &#x27;L&#x27; and &#x27;t&#x27; but instead it would correspond to the hiragana, け (&#x27;ke&#x27;). Notice that it looks very similar when written. Many hiragana, katakana and kanji are taken apart and reassembled using different characters including alphabet characters. It is unclear why this usage is now seen. Some believe that this started as a way of making secret messages that a quick peek wouldn&#x27;t reveal, while others claim that it was just for fun. This can be related to the way the English language hacking culture uses 1337 language to hide the meaning of the words typed. It is also possibly due to different character limits when different languages are used, e.g. 160 Latin characters and 70 Unicode (inc. kanji). By splitting the characters into alpha-numeric characters, it extends the possible over-all length of the message.

==Cell phone novels==
A cell phone novel, or , is a literary work originally written on a cellular phone via text messaging. This type of literature originated in Japan, where it has become a popular literary genre. However, its popularity has also spread to other countries internationally, especially to China, the United States, Germany, and South Africa. Chapters usually consist of about 70–100 words each due to character limitations on cell phones.

==Mobile gaming==
In the early 2000s, mobile games gained mainstream popularity in Japan, years before the United States and Europe. By 2003, a wide variety of mobile games were available on Japanese phones, ranging from puzzle games and virtual pet titles that utilize camera phone technology to 3D games with PlayStation-quality graphics. Older arcade-style games became particularly popular on mobile phones, which were an ideal platform for arcade-style games designed for shorter play sessions.

Graphics improved as handsets became more powerful, as demonstrated by the mobile version of &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; in 2003, though such titles typically cost twice as much as other mobile games. &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; was published by Namco, one of the most successful mobile game publishers at the time. That same year, Namco also released a fighting game that uses camera phone technology to create a player character based on the player&#x27;s profile, and interprets the image to determine the character&#x27;s speed and power; the character can then be sent to a friend&#x27;s mobile to battle. Namco began attempting to introduce mobile gaming to Europe in 2003.

Other mobile games released in 2003 included a Tamagotchi-like virtual pet game by Panasonic where the pet can be fed with photos of foods taken with a camera phone. Another virtual pet game utilized a fingerprint scanner built into a handset to interact with a pet. Another mobile game that year was an educational game that utilized a mobile&#x27;s microphone to help children with their pronunciation skills.

Japan is the world&#x27;s largest market for mobile games. The Japanese market today is becoming increasingly dominated by mobile games, which generated $5.1 billion in 2013, more than traditional console games in the country.

==Decoration==

Phone decorations are common, notably mobile phone charms and various stickers. The stickers are often in the maki-e style, and are advertised as such.

==Teenagers and mobile phones==
Paging devices used in the late 1980s to early 1990s predate mobile phones and paved the way for the popularity of the phones among teenagers. Pagers could only display numbers and were intended to alert the owner that they had received a call from a certain phone number, but teens quickly began using numeric messages to communicate many things, including greetings and everyday emotions. Most were based on various ways numbers could be read in Japanese. Examples are

* &quot;4-6-4-9&quot; – yo-ro-shi-ku (&quot;hello,&quot; &quot;best regards&quot;)
* &quot;3-3-4-1&quot; – sa-mi-shi-i (&quot;I feel lonely&quot;)
* &quot;8-8-9-1-9&quot; – ha-ya-ku-i-ku (&quot;hurry up, let&#x27;s go&quot;)

With the rapidly falling prices of cell phones in the mid-1990s, young people began experimenting with the short message service that the mobile phone companies started offering. When the i-mode service became available, the mobile phone culture began flourishing earnestly as this service offered an E-mail application. Magazines and television regularly make specials focusing on the current trend of how mobile phones are used by young people.

==Forefront of consumer technology==
There is a popular trend in Japan to use the mobile phone handset to read information from special barcodes. The current technology is based on &#x27;QR codes&#x27; which are a form of 2D barcode that is written out in a square shape instead of a bar shape. The phone handset can scan the QR code using its camera or other input, decode the information, and then take actions based on the type of content. The most popular usage of these QR codes is in advertising. All over Japan there are posters with the codes on and they are found extensively in magazines and even on some people&#x27;s business cards. The QR code usually has links to a web site address or email address that the phone can access, or it might contain address and telephone numbers.

Sony, working with NTT DoCoMo, has been spearheading the mobile phone wallet technology, commonly known as &#x27;FeliCa&#x27;. This technology makes use of an RFID chip inside the handset that can communicate with reading devices when the phone is placed near them. Though the technology is relatively new, there are many locations such as convenience stores which allow users to pay for goods using their phones; some vending machines even accept phone payments. Users must &#x27;charge up&#x27; their accounts with credits before they can pay using their phones.

The Ubiquitous Business Department of NTT DoCoMo is developing the technology for a mobile phone to be the purchase system for virtual shops and smart shops, an authentication system in the medical field, and the purchase point for street poster advertisements.

Gracenote and Media Socket have a service where the user can hold the phone up to a source of music (such as a speaker), and, by dialing a certain phone number, find the song in a database and have it identified. The user receives the song&#x27;s title, artist, and album within seconds. This information can in turn be used to search the mobile Internet to find that song. Many of these technologies are now common place throughout the world thanks to the rise of smartphones, such as Android and iOS devices.

==Selfie culture==

The modern selfie has origins in Japanese kawaii (cute) culture, which involves an obsession with beautifying self-representation in photographic forms, particularly among females. By the 1990s, self-photography developed into a major preoccupation among Japanese schoolgirls, who took photos with friends and exchanged copies that could be pasted into kawaii albums. The digital selfie originates from purikura (Japanese shorthand for &quot;print club&quot;), which are Japanese photo sticker booths. Video game companies Sega and Atlus introduced the first purikura in February 1995, initially at game arcades, before expanding to other popular culture locations such as fast food shops, train stations, karaoke establishments and bowling alleys. Purikura became a popular form of entertainment among youths in Japan, and then across East Asia, in the 1990s.

To capitalize on the purikura phenomenon in East Asia, Japanese mobile phones began including a front-facing camera, which facilitated the creation of selfies. The first front-facing camera phone was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP-210, released in Japan in May 1999. It was called a &quot;mobile videophone&quot; at the time. It stored up to 20 JPEG images, which could be sent over e-mail, or the phone could send up to two images per second over Japan&#x27;s Personal Handy-phone System (PHS) wireless cellular network. This led to a transition in Japanese selfie culture from purikura to mobile phones. Photographic features in Japanese purikura and smartphones were later adopted by apps such as Instagram and Snapchat, including scribbling graffiti or typing text over selfies, adding features that beautify the image, and photo editing options such as cat whiskers or bunny ears.

==Negative aspects==
It is considered a violation of good etiquette to answer a cell phone in certain public places. For example, on trains it is rude to answer or talk on cellphones. Many people keep their phone in &#x27;manner mode&#x27; (silent mode) in order to not bother others and to avoid embarrassment on trains. On the other hand, writing emails or playing games with a cell phone while riding the train is completely acceptable.

Electromagnetic energy is theorized to cause interference with heart pacemakers and other medical devices. Most trains contain signs demanding that mobile phones be turned off when around seats reserved for the elderly and handicapped, but passengers rarely do so. In hospitals, it is expected that one should turn it off entirely.

Both talking on the phone or texting/messaging while operating a vehicle or riding a bicycle are prohibited, but nevertheless remain fairly common.

<text>Giovanni Dalmata (; c. 1440 – c. 1514), born Ioannes Stephani Duknovich de Tragurio, also known as Giovanni Duknovich di Traù in Italy and Ivan Stjepanov Duknović in Croatia, was a sculptor from Trogir, Dalmatia, who was mainly active in Rome, Hungary and his native country during the European Renaissance. Dalmata was, with Mino da Fiesole and Andrea Bregno, one of the leading sculptors in Rome in the second half of the 15th century.

==Biography==
He was born in Vinišće, a Dalmatian village (now a part of Marina) in Venetian Dalmatia around 1440. His father was Stjepan Duknović, a stonemason in Trogir. He came to Rome between 1460 and 1465 to work for Pope Paul II on the Palazzo di Venezia. Other works in and around Rome include the &quot;Tempietto&quot; of S. Giacomo in Vicovaro (near Tivoli), the tomb monuments of Pope Paul II in St. Peter&#x27;s (now dismantled), the tomb of Cardinal Bartolomeo della Rovere in San Clemente, the tomb of Cardinal Bernardo Eroli (now in the Grotte Vaticane).

Around 1488–1490, Giovanni went to the Court of King Matthias Corvinus in Buda, where he stayed for a few years, mastering a number of works which were unfortunately all either destroyed or badly damaged (e.g. the Fountain of Hercules in Visegrád).

After his stay in Hungary, Giovanni Dalmata returned to Trogir (Traù in Italian) where he left a number of works, most important among those is the statue of St. John the Evangelist in the Orsini Chapel in Trogir Cathedral. He is also the creator of the sculpture of St. Magdalene in the Franciscan monastery of St. Anthony on the nearby Čiovo island and worked with Nicolò Fiorentino and Andrea Alessi on the Renaissance Cippico Palace in Trogir.

Around 1503, he was in Rome again, working on the tomb of the papal protonotary Lomellino. In 1509 he executed the tomb of the Beato Giannelli for S. Ciriaco in Ancona. Some documents of 1513 and 1514 refer to one &quot;Magistro Joanni lapicida&quot; in Trogir where he presumably died soon afterwards.

A newly discovered work (&quot;The Virgin and Child&quot;, a marble relief) was offered on auction in London&#x27;s Katz gallery and bought for £250,000 by Trogir City Museum. The authenticity of this work remains doubtful.

<doc id="486248" wikidata="Q1466276" url="?curid=486248" title="Hausa–Fulani">
<text>Hausa–Fulani are people of mixed Hausa and Fulani origin. They are primarily found in the Northern region of Nigeria, most of whom speak a variant of Hausa or Fula or both as their first language. The term Hausa-Fulani is also used mostly as a joint term to refer to both the monoethnic Hausa and Fulani ethnic populations in Northern Nigeria.

While some Fulani claim Semitic origins, Hausas are indigenous to West Africa. This suggests that the processes of &quot;Hausaization&quot; in the western Sudan region was probably both cultural and genetic. The Hausa–Fulani identity came into being as a direct result of the migration of Fulani people to Hausaland around the 14th century and their cultural assimilation into the Hausa society. At the beginning of the 19th century, Sheikh Usman dan Fodio led a successful jihad against the Hausa Kingdoms founding a centralized Fulani Empire (anglicized as the Sokoto Caliphate). After the jihad, Dan Fodio encouraged intermarriage between the immigrant Fulani and the conquered Hausa states and locals mainly other Hausa people; in addition, Jobawa, Dambazawa and Sullubawa Fulani clans originating in Futa Tooro migrated to the region and intermarried with the local urban mainly Hausa elite, and were a major factor in the linguistic, cultural and ethnic mixing of the Hausa–Fulani people. As result of this assimilation, Hausa–Fulani form the core and vast majority of the populations of Daura, Zamfara, Kano, Katsina, Zazzau, and Sokoto.

Hausa–Fulanis primarily speak variants of Hausa which form a dialect continuum of more-or-less mutually intelligible regional varieties. Hausa is spoken by over 100 to 150 million people across Africa, making it the most spoken Indigenous African language and the 11th most spoken language in the world. Since the Trans-Saharan trade, Hausa is used as a lingua franca spanning from Agadez deep in the Sahara Desert of Niger to Northern Nigeria, and has many loanwords from Arabic. For centuries, it utilized an Ajami script which served as the basis of the language scholarly tradition. The script was replaced with the Latin orthography of the Boko alphabets, after the British conquered the Sokoto Caliphate.

== Historical perspective ==
Medieval Arabic sources refers to the area as &quot;Sudan&quot; or as &quot;Bilad Al Sudan&quot; (; ). This designation may have given rise to the term Negroland which was used by Europeans until the 19th century to refer to the inner poorly explored area north of the region of Guinea: consisting of the Slave Coast, Gold Coast, Grain Coast in West Africa.

Since the populations were partially affiliated with the Arab Muslim culture of North Africa, they started to trade and be referred to by the Arabic speakers as &quot;Al-Sudan&quot; (meaning &quot;The Blacks&quot;) as they were considered an extended part of the Muslim world. There are early historical references by medieval Arab and Muslim historians and geographers which to refer to the Kanem-Bornu Empire as the region&#x27;s major centre for Islamic civilization. It is likely that the medieval Hausa Kingdoms formed trading ties with the Bornu Empire, which became increasingly wealthy as the main African transshipment centre for the trans-Saharan slave trade. Hausa rulers also likely provided Sudanic peoples as a tributary to the Bornu Empire in order to avert war with the Empire.

The Sudan was gradually fulanised with the spread of Islam from the 7th century AD, when the liturgical language Arabic was first brought to the Sudan via Bornu. Until this point, the Fulani, a nomadic ethnic group primarily traversed the semi-desert Sahelian region, north of the Sudan, with cattle and avoided trade and intermingling with the Sudanic peoples. Fulanisation was at least partly strengthened in the rural areas in the early 16th century with the emigration of the settled Dambazawa wealthy trading clan from Bornu.

The Sokoto Caliphate emerged strong after the jihad under the leadership of Usman dan Fodio (1754–1817), whom a council proclaimed as the Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin or Commander of the Faithful. The empire with Arabic as its official language grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants, who sent out armies in every direction. The vast landlocked empire connected the East with the West Sudan region. As an Islamic state, authority is derived from piety and scholarship, thus the Sultan sent out emirs to establish suzerainty over the conquered territories and promote Islamic civilization, consolidating in order to establish administrative structures and a ruling elite. This settlement eventually gave rise to the gradual cultural assimilation of the Fulani culture by the Hausa people in major Hausa cities (or Hausa Bakwai) of: Daura, Hadeija, Kano, Katsina, Zazzau, Rano, and Gobir, leading to the mass education and promotion of Hausa language and culture through schools and later mass media, during the 20th century by the British.

<text>Boulder Dash is a maze-based puzzle video game released in 1984 by First Star Software for Atari 8-bit computers. It was created by Canadian developers Peter Liepa and Chris Gray. The player controls Rockford, who tunnels through dirt to collect diamonds. Boulders and other objects remain fixed until the dirt beneath them is removed, then they fall and become a hazard. Puzzles are designed around collecting diamonds without being crushed and exploiting the interactions between objects (such as a butterfly turning into diamonds when hit with a falling rock). The game&#x27;s name is a pun on &quot;balderdash&quot;.

&quot;Boulder Dash&quot; was ported to many 8-bit and 16-bit systems and turned into a coin-operated arcade video game. It was followed by multiple sequels and re-releases. Many games were influenced by &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;, such as &quot;Repton&quot; and direct clones like &quot;Emerald Mine&quot;, resulting in the sub-genre of rocks-and-diamonds games.

As of September 2017, BBG Entertainment owns the intellectual property rights to &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Boulder Dash&quot; takes place in a series of caves, each of which is laid out as rectangular grid of blocks. The player guides the player character, Rockford, with a joystick or arrow keys. In each cave, Rockford has to collect a set number of diamonds within a time limit. Player has to avoid falling rocks and other obstacles, including amoeba, butterflies, and fireflies. When enough diamonds have been collected, the exit door opens, and going through this exit door completes the cave.

==Development==
As an aspiring game developer, Peter Liepa reached out to a local publisher called Inhome Software. They put him in touch with a young man—Chris Gray—who had submitted a game programmed in BASIC that was not commercial quality, but had potential. The project began with the intention of converting this game to machine language and releasing it through Inhome, but according to Liepa, the game was very primitive. He decided to expand the concept and add more interesting dynamics, and he wrote the new version in Forth in about six months. When it became clear that the game was worth releasing, Liepa rewrote &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; in 6502 assembly language.

Dissatisfied with the lack of a contact from Inhome Software, Liepa searched for a new publisher. He settled on First Star Software, which, according to him, was very happy to publish the game.

==Ports==
The game was licensed by Exidy for use with their Max-A-Flex arcade cabinet. Released in 1984, it allows buying 30 seconds of game time. This was the first home computer game to be converted to an arcade console.

==Reception==
&quot;II Computing&quot; said that &quot;bright, colorful animation coupled with a breezy story line make this game more than just a momentary diversion&quot;. &quot;Computer Games&quot; magazine called it an &quot;incredible addicting maze game&quot; along the lines of &quot;Dig Dug&quot;, but faster and more exciting. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; called the &quot;fascinating&quot; Commodore 64 version &quot;an entertainment classic&quot;, with excellent graphics and sound and &quot;lots of delightful touches&quot;.

&quot;Mean Machines&quot; gave the Game Boy port of &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; a score of 90%, praising it as &quot;one of the finest video games ever written&quot;, describing the game as &quot;one to buy as soon as possible&quot; and noting its faithfulness to the original Commodore 64 version. The same publication reviewed the NES version favourably, stating that it was &quot;an extremely impressive title&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest games ever written&quot;. It was given a 92% rating.

The ZX Spectrum version of Boulder Dash received a positive review from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine. The reviewer found the game&#x27;s sounds and graphics to be adequate, though noted that slow screen scrolling was an issue. Despite this, the reviewer praised the game&#x27;s &quot;incredible playability&quot; and addictive nature.

The ZX Spectrum version was placed ninth in the &quot;Your Sinclair Top 100 Speccy Games Of All Time (Ever)&quot; by journalist Stuart Campbell. In 1993, &quot;Commodore Force&quot; ranked the game at number 17 on its list of the top 100 Commodore 64 games.

IGN reviewed the Virtual Console release of the Commodore 64 version. Although the graphics and sound were both found to be dated they enjoyed the game stating that it &quot;still feels as fresh as it did in 1984&quot;. They concluded by stating &quot;though it doesn&#x27;t look like much, &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; rocks&quot;.

&quot;Boulder Dash&quot; was included in the top 30 Commodore 64 games by C&#x27;t Magazin in Germany.

The game sold more than 500,000 copies by August 1994.

==Legacy==
&quot;Boulder Dash&quot; was the first in a long series of games:
* Boulder Dash (1985 – Arcade) – in 1985 another arcade version was released on Data East&#x27;s &quot;DECO Cassette System&quot;, with improved graphics but a reduced display grid on a vertical monitor.
* Boulder Dash II (1985) – published under several different titles; &quot;Rockford&#x27;s Riot&quot; on the MSX, &quot;Rockford&#x27;s Revenge&quot; on the C64. The second release in Japan was titled &quot;Champion Boulder Dash&quot;, but it is not a port of the western game.
* Boulder Dash 3 (1986 – Apple II, C64, Spectrum, PC) – monochrome space-themed graphics and poorly designed levels made this a critical failure.
* Boulder Dash Construction Kit (1986 – Apple II, C64, Spectrum, Atari 8-bit computers, Atari ST) – this release included a small number of levels (12 caves and 3 intermission levels), but was titled &quot;Boulder Dash IV – The Game&quot; for the Spectrum re-release. The title allowed players access to tools which allowed them to design their own levels.
* Super Boulder Dash (1986 – Apple II, C64, PC) – a compilation of &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; and &quot;Boulder Dash II&quot; published by Electronic Arts.
* Rockford (1988 – Arcade, Amiga, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Arcade, Spectrum, Amstrad, C64) - &quot;Rockford&quot; was originally a licensed arcade game produced by Arcadia Systems, and later converted to various home computer formats.
* Boulder Dash Part 2 (1990 – Arcade)
* Boulder Dash (1990 - Game Boy)
* Boulder Dash (1990 - NES)
* Boulder Dash EX (2002 – Game Boy Advance) - this one has a new &quot;EX mode&quot; and &quot;Classic mode&quot; which is a direct port of the 1984 PC version.
* Boulder Dash Xmas 2002 Edition (2002 – PC)
* GemJam Gold (2003 – PC) – the game&#x27;s credits claim this is based on &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;, and is licensed by First Star.
* Boulder Dash – Treasure Pleasure (2003 – PC)
* Boulder Dash: Rocks! (2007 – DS, iOS)
* Boulder Dash Vol. 1 (2009 – iOS) - released by Chillingo and First Star Software. It includes all 80 levels of the original as well as 4 additional bonus levels.

<text>In mathematics, an aliquot sequence is a sequence of positive integers in which each term is the sum of the proper divisors of the previous term. If the sequence reaches the number 1, it ends, since the sum of the proper divisors of 1 is 0.

==Definition and overview==
The sequence starting with a positive integer can be defined formally in terms of the sum-of-divisors function or the aliquot sum function in the following way:
formula_1
If the condition is added, then the terms after 0 are all 0, and all aliquot sequences would be infinite, and we can conjecture that all aliquot sequences are convergent, the limit of these sequences are usually 0 or 6.

For example, the aliquot sequence of 10 is because:

formula_2

Many aliquot sequences terminate at zero; all such sequences necessarily end with a prime number followed by 1 (since the only proper divisor of a prime is 1), followed by 0 (since 1 has no proper divisors). See for a list of such numbers up to 75. There are a variety of ways in which an aliquot sequence might not terminate:
* A perfect number has a repeating aliquot sequence of period 1. The aliquot sequence of 6, for example, is 
* An amicable number has a repeating aliquot sequence of period 2. For instance, the aliquot sequence of 220 is 
* A sociable number has a repeating aliquot sequence of period 3 or greater. (Sometimes the term &quot;sociable number&quot; is used to encompass amicable numbers as well.) For instance, the aliquot sequence of 1264460 is 
* Some numbers have an aliquot sequence which is eventually periodic, but the number itself is not perfect, amicable, or sociable. For instance, the aliquot sequence of 95 is Numbers like 95 that are not perfect, but have an eventually repeating aliquot sequence of period 1 are called aspiring numbers.

The lengths of the aliquot sequences that start at are
:1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 7, 2, 5, 5, 6, 2, 4, 2, 7, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 7, 3, 1, 2, 15, 2, 3, 6, 8, 3, 4, 2, 7, 3, 4, 2, 14, 2, 5, 7, 8, 2, 6, 4, 3, ... 

The final terms (excluding 1) of the aliquot sequences that start at are
:1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7, 3, 7, 11, 3, 13, 7, 3, 3, 17, 11, 19, 7, 11, 7, 23, 17, 6, 3, 13, 28, 29, 3, 31, 31, 3, 7, 13, 17, 37, 7, 17, 43, 41, 3, 43, 43, 3, 3, 47, 41, 7, 43, ... 

Numbers whose aliquot sequence terminates in 1 are
:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, ... 

Numbers whose aliquot sequence known to terminate in a perfect number, other than perfect numbers themselves (6, 28, 496, ...), are 
:25, 95, 119, 143, 417, 445, 565, 608, 650, 652, 675, 685, 783, 790, 909, 913, ... 

Numbers whose aliquot sequence terminates in a cycle with length at least 2 are
:220, 284, 562, 1064, 1184, 1188, 1210, 1308, 1336, 1380, 1420, 1490, 1604, 1690, 1692, 1772, 1816, 1898, 2008, 2122, 2152, 2172, 2362, ... 

Numbers whose aliquot sequence is not known to be finite or eventually periodic are
:276, 306, 396, 552, 564, 660, 696, 780, 828, 888, 966, 996, 1074, 1086, 1098, 1104, 1134, 1218, 1302, 1314, 1320, 1338, 1350, 1356, 1392, 1398, 1410, 1464, 1476, 1488, ... 

A number that is never the successor in an aliquot sequence is called an untouchable number.
:2, 5, 52, 88, 96, 120, 124, 146, 162, 188, 206, 210, 216, 238, 246, 248, 262, 268, 276, 288, 290, 292, 304, 306, 322, 324, 326, 336, 342, 372, 406, 408, 426, 430, 448, 472, 474, 498, ... 

== Catalan–Dickson conjecture ==
An important conjecture due to Catalan, sometimes called the Catalan–Dickson conjecture, is that every aliquot sequence ends in one of the above ways: with a prime number, a perfect number, or a set of amicable or sociable numbers. The alternative would be that a number exists whose aliquot sequence is infinite yet never repeats. Any one of the many numbers whose aliquot sequences have not been fully determined might be such a number. The first five candidate numbers are often called the Lehmer five (named after D.H. Lehmer): 276, 552, 564, 660, and 966. However, 276 may reach a high apex in its aliquot sequence and then descend; the number 138 reaches a peak of 179931895322 before returning to 1.

Guy and Selfridge believe the Catalan–Dickson conjecture is false (so they conjecture some aliquot sequences are unbounded above (i.e., diverge)).

== Systematically searching for aliquot sequences ==

The aliquot sequence can be represented as a directed graph, formula_3, for a given integer formula_4, where formula_5 denotes the sum of the proper divisors of formula_6. Cycles in formula_3 represent sociable numbers within the interval formula_8. Two special cases are loops that represent perfect numbers and cycles of length two that represent amicable pairs.

<text>Oakland University (OU or Oakland) is a public research university in Auburn Hills and Rochester Hills, Michigan. Founded in 1957 through a donation of Matilda Dodge Wilson and husband Alfred G. Wilson, it was initially known as Michigan State University-Oakland, operating under the Michigan State University Board of Trustees, before gaining institutional independence from the board in 1970.

Oakland University is one of the eight research universities in the State of Michigan and is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. The university offers 132 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs and 138 professional graduate certificate, master&#x27;s degree, and doctoral degree programs, including those offered by the Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine. It had a total enrollment of more than 16,108 students in fall of 2022.

The university&#x27;s site comprises the Main Campus, Meadow Brook Estate, and two nationally ranked golf courses spread across 1,443 acres (5.84 km2). Meadow Brook Hall, a U.S. National Historic Landmark and the fourth-largest historic house museum in the United States, is located on the site.

Previously known as the Pioneers, Oakland&#x27;s athletic teams were renamed the Golden Grizzlies in 1998. They compete in the NCAA Division I Horizon League.

==History==

In 1908, John Francis Dodge and his wife Matilda purchased a farmhouse and of land known as Meadow Brook Farms, located in central Oakland County.

In 1920, Matilda inherited John&#x27;s fortune upon his death, soon remarrying to a lumber baron, Alfred G. Wilson. Between 1926 and 1929, the couple built Meadow Brook Hall on the land.

Oakland University was created in 1957 when Matilda Dodge Wilson and her second husband, Alfred Wilson, donated their estate to Michigan State University, including Meadow Brook Hall, Sunset Terrace and all the estate&#x27;s other buildings and collections, along with $2 million. Main campus buildings were completed on Squirrel Road in Pontiac Township (now the city of Auburn Hills). Originally known as Michigan State University–Oakland, the university enrolled its first students in 1959, was renamed Oakland University in 1963, and has been officially independent of Michigan State University since 1970.

Wilson demanded that U.S. Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield let the university use a Rochester, Michigan, mailing address (201 Meadow Brook Rd., Rochester, Michigan 48309), even though the main campus was in Pontiac Township (now the city of Auburn Hills). After Wilson reminded him that she had contributed to his administration, Summerfield granted her request.

In September 2009, tenured faculty members represented by the Oakland University chapter of the American Association of University Professors went on strike. Issues of contention included the university claiming ownership of professors&#x27; copyrights and patents, refusing to allow faculty input into matters of class size and curricula, reduction of health benefits and a three-year salary freeze. The salary freeze was in contrast to university president Gary Russi, who had just received a $100,000 raise. The university&#x27;s board of trustees maintained that the strike was illegal and filed a lawsuit against the Oakland AAUP. After a week&#x27;s strike, the faculty and administration came to an agreement on a three-year contract, which was implemented.

During the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, Oakland University hosted a debate between Republican presidential candidates on 9 November 2011. CNBC televised the debate nationally, and the Michigan Republican Party co-sponsored the debate with CNBC. Eight candidates participated: Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum.

In 2013, the Oakland University Board of Trustees approved a $65 million investment in campus expansion and improvement projects. Completed in the fall of 2014, projects included: construction of a nearly $30 million student housing complex; dramatic enhancement of outdoor recreation and athletic fields; construction of a 1,240-space parking structure, and; construction of new headquarters for facility and grounds maintenance operations. Longtime supporters of the university, Hugh and Nancy Elliott, made a donation to construct the Elliott Tower on the campus. The 151-foot carillon tower was completed in fall 2014 and houses the last bells to be cast by the Royal Bellfoundry Petit &amp; Fritsen of the Netherlands.

On 4 May 2017, the board announced Ora Hirsch Pescovitz as Oakland University&#x27;s seventh president. Her tenure began on 1 July 2017, under a 5-year contract. In September 2023, her contract was extended to June 2031.

For the fall 2022 semester, Oakland University had an enrollment of 16,108 students. Oakland University is the 6th largest of the 4-year universities in Michigan.

==Campus==

In addition to its location in the cities of Auburn Hills and Rochester Hills, Oakland University maintains an official &quot;hometown&quot; relationship with the nearby but not adjacent city of Rochester, Michigan. University and city officials signed a partnership agreement in 2003 to officially recognize the relationship between Rochester and Oakland University. In 1959, Rochester Village (now city) officials renamed the Fifth Street in downtown Rochester &quot;University Drive&quot; to showcase Rochester as a &quot;college town&quot;. The road is called Walton Boulevard adjacent to the University in Rochester Hills and Auburn Hills. This is often confused with University Drive in Auburn Hills, which originates at Oakland University&#x27;s main entrance in Auburn Hills, and continues west into downtown Pontiac. In 2005, the Rochester area was ranked 39th in the CNN/Money Magazine list of the Top 100 American cities in which to live.

Oakland University&#x27;s campus, which encompasses , includes trails and biking paths and two nationally ranked golf courses.

===Oakland County===
The university&#x27;s land in Auburn Hills and Rochester Hills is divided into the Main Campus, Meadow Brook Estate, and two golf courses.

====Main Campus====
Meadow Brook Theatre, which was founded in 1967, is the largest non-profit professional theater in Michigan, and presents a wide variety of award-winning productions throughout the year. Additionally, the Oakland University Art Gallery, which was formerly known as the Meadow Brook Art Gallery, presents at least six different exhibitions each academic year, in addition to hosting a variety of lectures, performances and symposia.

Kresge Library is the main library of Oakland University. It consists of four floors of study rooms and open-area tables. It also contains the Oakland University Archives, the Historical Abraham Lincoln Collection, the Jane M. Bingham Historical Children&#x27;s Collection, and a tech center. The library is named after Stanley and Sebastian Kresge who were both present for the library&#x27;s opening in 1962.

In 2009, an 18-hole disc golf course opened. Grizzly Oaks was co-designed by student Jarrett Schlaff and licensed by the Professional Disc Golf Association.

Oakland University&#x27;s student union, the Oakland Center, was renovated and expanded in 2018. The Oakland Center houses the offices of student organizations, a large food court with multiple restaurants, the student bookstore, a cafe, a pool hall and gaming center, a Student Technology Center, the campus newspaper &quot;The Oakland Post&quot;, computer labs, conference rooms, as well as the offices of the university radio station, WXOU (88.3 FM). Oakland University also has its own television station (OU TV) which is broadcast on-campus and to the local community.

The campus has recreational facilities for intramural sports and for Oakland University&#x27;s 16 NCAA Division I athletic teams, including the lighted Upper Athletic Fields, the indoor Sports Dome, fields for varsity baseball, softball, and soccer, and facilities for basketball, handball, track, and weight training. The campus recreation center houses Oakland University&#x27;s natatorium, and the Athletics Center O&#x27;rena, a 4,000-seat field house, is the home court for Oakland University basketball and volleyball.

Near the center of campus is the Elliot Tower (above). This clock tower was finished in 2014 after many delays to its construction that began toward the end of 1945 just after the end of WWII, making it both the oldest and one of the newest structures simultaneously at Oakland University.

====Meadow Brook Estate====
This portion of Oakland University consists of the historic Meadow Brook Hall and the land and buildings surrounding it. The hall, which is a 110-room Tudor revival–style mansion completed in 1929 as Oakland University founder Matilda Dodge Wilson&#x27;s Oakland County estate, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Meadow Brook Hall is the fourth-largest historic house museum in the United States, and houses a vast collection of historically significant art and furniture, including paintings by Rembrandt, Anthony van Dyck, Rosa Bonheur, Gilbert Stuart, Joshua Reynolds, John Constable, and Thomas Gainsborough, as well as sculptures by Antoine-Louis Barye, Frederic Remington, Cyrus Edwin Dallin, and Herbert Haseltine. Meadow Brook Hall is frequently utilized as a site for select university functions, including the Meadow Brook Ball, a popular student event. Until 2010, Meadow Brook Hall and its grounds were the site of the annual Meadow Brook Concours d&#x27;Elegance, one of the largest collector car shows in the world.

The Meadow Brook Music Festival is an outdoor entertainment venue with an on-site pavilion which accommodates close to 8,000 people. In addition to being the site of spring-time graduation ceremonies, Meadow Brook Music Festival also hosts comedians and musical acts. Meadow Brook Music Festival is managed by 313 Presents.

====Golf courses====
Oakland University has two nationally ranked golf courses that make up most of the southern portion of its land. Katke-Cousins sits on . Some of the course&#x27;s 18 holes remain from the 9-hole course John Dodge built when he lived at the estate. The other course, opened in 2000, is the R &amp; S Sharf course.

The residence halls include Hillcrest Hall, Oak View Hall, Hamlin Hall, Van Wagoner Hall, and Vandenberg Hall. Residential learning communities on Oakland University&#x27;s campus include Scholars Tower and the Residential Honors College community. Eight additional buildings make up the George T. Matthews student apartments, and six major Tudor-style buildings house the Ann V. Nicholson student apartments, which were completed in 2002.

Campus life is enhanced by more than 200 registered student organizations, ranging from cultural and religious groups to Greek organizations. Fraternities at Oakland University include Theta Chi, Sigma Pi, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Alpha Phi Alpha, Alpha Sigma Phi, Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, and Iota Phi Theta. Sororities include Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Sigma Tau, Gamma Phi Beta, Phi Sigma Sigma, Sigma Alpha Iota, Sigma Sigma Sigma, Alpha Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, Zeta Phi Beta, and Sigma Gamma Rho. The so-called Cottage District of campus, which consists of homes originally built for workers employed at the old Meadow Brook Estate, now contain fraternity and sorority houses.

<text>Sun Yee On (), or the New Righteousness and Peace Commercial and Industrial Guild, is one of the leading triads in Hong Kong and China. It has more than 25,000 members worldwide.
It is also believed to be active in the UK, the United States, France, and Belgium.

== History ==

Sun Yee On was founded by , originally from Teochew (Chaozhou), in 1919. &quot;Yee On&quot; () is a historical name for Chaozhou. Mainly through ethnic Chinese diaspora, it is thought to extend to the United States, Canada, Thailand, Australia, South Africa and Central America. Chin was deported to Taiwan in the early 1950s. His eldest son, Heung Wah-yim, who ostensibly worked as a law clerk, allegedly took over Sun Yee On in his place. The triad is also noted as being founded by &quot;Teochew and Hokkien immigrants&quot; to Hong Kong.

=== 1980s spill ===
In February 1986, a former Hong Kong police officer, Anthony Chung, who had become a member of Sun Yee On, asked the police for protection. He identified Heung Wah-yim as the leader of the triad, and this led to the police arresting eleven members of the Triad on 1 April 1987. Whilst searching Heung Wah-yim&#x27;s law office, they found a list of 900 numbered names, which appeared to be a membership list of Sun Yee On. In October, Heung Wah-yim was brought to trial, along with five accomplices who all pleaded guilty. Heung Wah-yim professed his innocence throughout the trial, claiming to be the president of a local chapter of the Lions Club and that the list found in his office consisted of potential donors. Chung and another former member were the main prosecution witnesses. On 20 January 1988, the jury found five of the defendants guilty, including Heung Wah-yim who was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison, acquitting the sixth.

=== 2000s ===
The triad operates several vice establishments in Tsim Sha Tsui and Yau Ma Tei, or at least did in November 2010 when a 29-year-old alleged office-bearer or &quot;red pole&quot; of the triad, named &quot;Sai B&quot; Chan, was arrested for vice offences and money laundering.

Lee Tai-lung (), a Sun Yee On boss in Tsim Sha Tsui, was murdered in front of the Kowloon Shangri-La hotel on 4 August 2009 by members of the Wo Shing Wo gang. It was supposedly a revenge attack ordered by Leung Kwok-chung, a senior member of a Wo Shing Wo crew in Tai Kok Tsui who was injured by Lee during a bar fight in July 2006 in Prat Avenue. Following Lee&#x27;s death, three of his former followers stepped in to defend his lucrative entertainment empire from other triads. In 2011(?), Lee&#x27;s three followers were tracked by &quot;Ko Tat&quot;, another &quot;red pole&quot; in Wan Chai, who failed to spread his influence across the harbour. Tai Hau, leader of another Sun Yee On faction active in Tuen Mun, tried to encroach upon Lee&#x27;s West Kowloon and Tsim Sha Tsui operations. His attempts were thwarted by an undercover police operation, as a result of which 222 people were arrested in January 2012. The Organised Crime and Triad Bureau suspects that &quot;Ko Chun&quot; may be the latest kingpin of Lee&#x27;s original turf.

On 22 March 2012, police arrested 102 members of Sun Yee On in Shenzhen, China.

== In popular culture ==
* In the anime adaptation of &quot;Black Lagoon&quot;, the Thai branch of Sun Yee On, led by a man named Wan, is based in the fictional city of Roanapur and competes with the other organized crime syndicates in the city like the 14K.
* The 2012 video game &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot; focuses on Wei Shen, an undercover police officer transferred from San Francisco to Hong Kong and the HKPF as part of a joint operation to infiltrate the &quot;Sun On Yee&quot;, inspired by the Sun Yee On, and eliminate or incarcerate their most powerful members. What makes Wei the most likely candidate, but also the most dangerous one, is that he grew up with some Sun On Yee members, giving him a way to integrate within the triad but has his superiors concerned that he might eventually become too attached and possibly forget his law enforcement duties.

<text>The Minister for Finance () is a senior minister in the Government of Ireland. The Minister for Finance leads the Department of Finance and is responsible for all financial and monetary matters of the state; and is considered the second most important member of the Government of Ireland, after the Taoiseach.

The current office holder is Paschal Donohoe, TD. He is assisted by one Minister of State Robert Troy, TD.

==Overview==

The Minister for Finance holds the second most important ministerial position in the Irish Cabinet after that of the Taoiseach. The minister is in charge of the Department of Finance responsible for all financial matters in Ireland. It is one of three positions in the government which the Constitution requires to be held by a member of Dáil Éireann, the other two being Taoiseach and Tánaiste. Ministers for finance who later became Taoiseach include Jack Lynch, Charles Haughey, Albert Reynolds, John Bruton, Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen.

The department and minister are occasionally called the &quot;Irish Exchequer&quot; (or simply the &quot;Exchequer&quot;), a term previously used under the Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland (disestablished in 1817).

===Budget===
One of the most important aspects of the Minister&#x27;s work is the creation of the annual budget which is delivered to the Dáil in a speech, which must be given before 15 October due to the Two-Pack agreement. In the budget, the minister details the government&#x27;s spending programme for the coming year. The budget consists of:
*a financial statement to the Dáil,
*Budgetary measures (a list of budgetary changes detailing the cost/yield of same),
*Budget statistics, and
*financial resolutions.

<doc id="486293" wikidata="Q3366820" url="?curid=486293" title="Green Party of Saskatchewan">
<text>The Saskatchewan Green Party is a Green political party in Saskatchewan, Canada. The party was founded as the New Green Alliance in 1998 by a coalition of environmental and social justice activists. In the twenty-first century, only the New Democratic Party and the Saskatchewan Party have fielded more candidates than the Greens in provincial elections, although no Greens have been elected to the Legislature. The current party leader is Naomi Hunter.

== History ==

=== Foundations and the New Green Alliance ===
In the mid-1990s, a number of environmental and social justice activists began to organize against the perceived rightward drift of the governing New Democrats (NDP) under Premier Roy Romanow, who were seen to have embraced Third Way politics. In April 1998, organizers held a news conference, stating their intention &quot;... to create a political party committed to protect the environment from corporate plunder and to advance a social justice agenda,&quot; before officially registering the New Green Alliance (NGA) with Elections Saskatchewan in January 1999. Early on, the party debated focusing on community activism over electoralism—future party leader Victor Lau stated in 1998 that in his opinion, &quot;... 20 per cent of the energy of the new party should be devoted to electoral politics and 80 per cent to promoting community projects like low-cost housing, new transit systems, or solar energy.&quot; Others looked to revive the democratic socialist politics of Tommy Douglas, the first CCF/NDP Premier of Saskatchewan, which they argued the NDP had drifted away from.

The party&#x27;s first leader was anti-nuclear activist Neil Sinclair. In the 1999 provincial election, the NGA ran 16 candidates province-wide, earning 1% of the vote and approximately 4% of the vote on average where they ran. The NGA, whose platform was characterized as &quot;counter-ideological&quot; in contrast to the NDP and Saskatchewan Party, who were competing to form government, found it difficult to garner media attention during the campaign. In the 2003 election, under the leadership of Ben Webster, the party ran 27 candidates but actually lost support compared to 1999, earning only 0.6% of the vote province-wide.

=== Saskatchewan Green Party ===
In 2005, the NGA changed its name to come in line with the federal Greens, becoming the Green Party of Saskatchewan; however, the party maintained that it was only loosely affiliated with the Green Party of Canada. The party had several short-term leaders between 2005 and 2006, when antiwar and anti-vaccination activist Sandra Finley became leader ahead of the 2007 provincial election. The Greens ran a much larger campaign in 2007, fielding candidates in 48 out of 58 ridings. The party was able to capture 2.0% of the vote; Harold Johnson, running in the Cumberland riding, received 6.2% of the vote and secured the first third-place finish for the Greens.

On 6 September, 2011—the unofficial kickoff for the 2011 provincial election campaign—Green leader Larissa Shasko resigned her position to join the campaign of Regina South NDP candidate Yens Pedersen. Upon her resignation, Shasko cited frustrations with the &quot;inner workings&quot; of the party and concerns about a potential candidate. Her resignation triggered a visit to Saskatoon by federal Green leader Elizabeth May, who also announced that deputy leader Victor Lau had been elevated to become the provincial party&#x27;s new leader—a decision that was reinforced by party members at a special leadership convention held on 25 September. Lau and the party ran a full slate of 58 candidates—a first for the party—43% of which were women. Although no Green candidates were elected, the party increased its vote share and emerged from the election as the third largest party in the province, surpassing the Liberals for the first time.

After the 2011 election, the party began an effort to organize on a constituency basis across the province. In March 2015, the party was rebranded as the Saskatchewan Green Party and ran a nearly full slate again in the 2016 provincial election under Lau, though fell back in vote share across the province, finishing in fourth place.

In March 2020, former federal Green candidate Naomi Hunter was named leader of the Greens ahead of the 2020 provincial election. In the election, the party increased its vote share, finishing with its second highest total after 2011, but again finished fourth, this time finishing behind the fledgling Buffalo Party. The party saw its vote share decline in the 2024 election, although it again finished in fourth place overall.

<text>The 6th Division () was a unit of the Finnish Army during the Continuation War. Subordinated to the German XXXVI Corps, the division took part in the German-led Operation Arctic Fox in 1941. In 1943, the division was moved to Eastern Karelia, from where it was moved to the Karelian Isthmus following the start of the 1944 Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive. Following the Moscow armistice, the division also took part in the Lapland War against the German forces remaining in Finnish Lapland.

==History==
Originally a part of the Finnish V Corps, the 6th Division was attached to the German XXXVI Corps in Northern Finland in 1941. As part of Operation Arctic Fox, the division attacked alongside the SS Division Nord and German 169th Infantry Division against Salla with the goal of reaching Kandalaksha on the White Sea coast. The town of Salla was captured, but the division suffered 405 casualties in the process. Following the capture of Salla, the division continued towards river Verman, reaching it on October 18, 1941. By this point, both increasingly difficult logistics and the losses suffered forced Operation Arctic Fox to be halted. The 6th division was considered unfit for attack. During these actions, the division also fought alongside a small German tank unit, the Panzer-Abteilung 211, which consisted of captured French tanks.

Following the failure of Operation Arctic Fox, the Finnish general headquarters wanted to reduce the division to a brigade-sized element to help both a labor shortage on the home front, as well as for foreign political reasons related to attacking beyond the pre-Winter War borders. The division was reorganized as the 12th Brigade in early 1942. In January 1943, the brigade was re-expanded to divisional size, again taking the name 6th Division, and assigned to the Aunus Group. In July 1943, it was reassigned to the isthmus north of Lake Onega as part of the Maaselkä Group.

After the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive started in 1944, the 6th Division was moved to the Karelian Isthmus as a component of the Finnish IV Corps. There it took part in the decisive Battle of Tali-Ihantala, where its arrival prevented the breaking of the Armored Division and enabled the Armored Division and the 11th Division to be moved out of the line to act as a reserve.

After the Moscow armistice, the division also took part in the Lapland War against the German forces still in Lapland. On September 30, 1944, the division was subordinated to the Armored Division, with the resulting formation being named Group Lagus. As a part of this formation, the division participated in the capture of Rovaniemi, after which it was disbanded.

==Commanders==
* Colonel Werner Viikla (1941)
* Major General Einar Vihma (1943–1944)
* Colonel A. Puromaa (1944)

==Organization==
The 6th Division was organised from men from the Far-North Military Province (&quot;Perä-Pohjolan Sotilaslääni&quot;). It lacked the Heavy Artillery Battalion.

The division consisted of the following subordinate units:
* Infantry Regiment 12 (Rovaniemi)
* Infantry Regiment 33 (Sodankylä)
* Infantry Regiment 54 (Western Lapland)
* Field Artillery Regiment 14 (Tornio)
* Light Battalion 3
* Engineer Battalion 36
* Signal Battalion 36

<text>Ronald Michael Delany (born 6 March 1935) is an Irish former athlete who specialised in middle-distance running. He won a gold medal in the 1500 metres at the 1956 Summer Olympics. He later earned a bronze medal in the 1500 metres event at the 1958 European Athletics Championships in Stockholm.

Delany also competed at the 1954 European Athletics Championships in Bern and the 1960 Summer Olympics, though he was less successful on these occasions. He retired from competitive athletics in 1962. Delany is one of Ireland&#x27;s most recognisable Olympians and international ambassadors.

==Early life==

Born in Arklow, County Wicklow, Delany moved with his family to Sandymount, Dublin 4 when he was six. Delany later went to the Christian Brothers&#x27; O&#x27;Connell School, North Richmond Street (where there are all-weather, floodlit sports facilities named in his honour), to Sandymount High School and to Catholic University School. At Catholic University School (CUS), Delany was first coached by Jack Sweeney (mathematics teacher), to whom he sent a telegram from Melbourne stating &quot;We did it Jack&quot;. Delany in 2008 said about Sweeney, &quot;Other people would have seen my potential but he was the one who in effect helped me execute my potential&quot;.

Delany studied commerce and finance at Villanova University in the United States. While there he was coached by the well-known track coach Jumbo Elliott.

==Career==

Delany&#x27;s first achievement of note was reaching the final of the 800 metres at the 1954 European Athletics Championships in Bern. In 1956, he became the seventh runner to join the club of four-minute milers, but nonetheless, he struggled to make the Irish team for the 1956 Summer Olympics, held in Melbourne.

Delany qualified for the Olympic 1,500 metres final, in which local runner John Landy was the favourite. Delany kept close to Landy until the final lap, when Delany started a crushing final sprint, winning the race in a new Olympic record. Delany thereby became the first Irishman to win an Olympic gold medal in athletics since Bob Tisdall and Pat O&#x27;Callaghan in 1932. The Irish people learned of its new champion at breakfast time. Delany was Ireland&#x27;s last Olympic champion for 36 years, until Michael Carruth won the gold medal in boxing at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

Delany won the bronze medal in the 1,500 metres event at the 1958 European Athletics Championships. He went on to represent Ireland once again at the 1960 Summer Olympics held in Rome, this time in the 800 metres. He finished sixth in his quarter-final heat.

Delany continued his running career in North America, winning four successive AAU titles in the mile, adding to his total of four Irish national titles, and three NCAA titles. He was next to unbeatable on indoor tracks over that period, which included a 40-race winning streak. He broke the World Indoor Mile Record on three occasions. In 1961 Delany won the gold medal in the World University games in Sofia, Bulgaria. He retired from competitive running in 1962.

==Retirement==

After retiring from competition, Delany first worked in the United States for the Irish airline Aer Lingus. After that, for almost 20 years, he was Assistant Chief Executive of B&amp;I Line, responsible for marketing and operations of the Irish ferry company based in Dublin. In 1998, he established his own company focused on marketing and sports consultancy. Ron Delany coached athletics for a period at Franciscan College Gormanston in the 1960s.

==Honours==

In 2006, Delany was granted the Freedom of the City of Dublin. He was also conferred with an honorary Doctor of Laws Degree by University College Dublin in 2006. In 2019, a housing scheme in Arklow, where Delany was born, was named Delany Park in his honour. He attended the opening in person. Similarly, two streets in Strabane in Northern Ireland were named Delaney Crescent and Olympic Drive in the 1950s in his honour – however, Delany was not aware of these until it was pointed out that his surname had been spelt wrongly.

<doc id="486311" wikidata="Q5450762" url="?curid=486311" title="Finnish Cannabis Association">
<text>The Finnish Cannabis Association (FCA; ; , commonly referred to by the acronym SKY) is a Finnish non-governmental organisation whose purpose is to advocate legalisation or decriminalisation of cannabis.

The FCA started operating in 1990 and was officially established in 1991. According its mission statement, the purpose of the association is to influence the Finnish legislation so that adults could legally use, obtain and cultivate cannabis for personal use. The FCA also studies the use of cannabis in different cultures during different times.

The association had 36 members in 1991, and about 650 in 2000.

== History ==
===Background===
Over the years the FCA has faced many hardships in Finland, where a lot of the population do not make practically any distinction between different illegal drugs (&quot;huumeet&quot;), such as cannabis and heroin. Reasons for this include the fact that the use of cannabis has generally been much less common in Finland than in other EU countries, and that the tradition of &quot;drug education&quot;, based mainly in intimidation and modeled after practices from the United States and Sweden, is still quite strong in schools and the media. According to the traditional Finnish mindset, it is preferable to lose control with alcohol or to even use it excessively over long periods of time, than to experiment with cannabis, which is seen both as very dangerous in itself and as a &quot;gateway drug&quot;.

===Legal status===
The Finnish Cannabis Association first applied for the status of a registered association (&quot;rekisteröity yhdistys&quot;, ry) in 1991, but the association register office maintained by the Finnish Ministry of Justice, and later the Supreme Administrative Court have rejected the application. The ministry based their rejection, in 1993, on the grounds that the purpose of FCA is &quot;against good customs so that the expressed purpose is contrary to the views about justice and morality prevailing in our society&quot;. As of 2005, the FCA still has not obtained the status of a registered association.

In 1991 two members of the Finnish parliament representing the Finnish Agrarian Party (now True Finns) made an inquiry on the legality of the operation of FCA, with the aim of putting an end to the cannabis organisation. The Ministry of the Interior, which carried out the inspection, responded that &quot;the association has not operated fundamentally against the law or good customs&quot;.

===Activities===
The FCA has attained some credibility, by e.g. taking part in public drug policy discussions and debates, and occasionally co-operating governmental health sector organisations as well as with other harm reduction groups. However, a long-standing problem for the association has been that it is not always taken seriously, and instead is dismissed by many as a &quot;bunch of drugged-out hippies&quot;.

In recent years perhaps the most visible FCA activity has been the annual cannabis march (&quot;Hamppumarssi&quot;, part of the global Million Marijuana March demonstrations) in Helsinki. (Similar marches in other Finnish cities have been organised by other loose pro-cannabis groups, perhaps reflecting a Helsinki-centric nature of the FCA.) However, among the rising, largely internet-based, cannabis &quot;subculture&quot; in Finland, the FCA has sometimes been criticised for stagnating and lack of activity.

In April 2024 a citizens&#x27; initiative with 54 000 signatures was delivered to the Parliament of Finland by deputy chairman Coel Thomas.

<doc id="486313" wikidata="Q151356" url="?curid=486313" title="Fernsehturm Berlin">
<text>The Fernsehturm (; ) in central Berlin was constructed between 1965 and 1969 by the government of the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, as both a functional broadcasting facility and a symbol of Communist power. 

It remains a landmark today from its position next to Alexanderplatz in the city&#x27;s Marien Quarter, part of the district of Mitte, visible across most suburban districts of Berlin. With a height of (including antenna) it is the tallest structure in Germany, and the third-tallest structure in the European Union. When built it was the fourth-tallest freestanding structure in the world after the Empire State Building and the John Hancock Center.

Of the four tallest structures in the European Union, the Fernsehturm is shorter than the Torreta de Guardamar, shorter than the Riga Radio and TV Tower, and taller than the Trbovlje Power Station. The structure is also more than higher than the old Berlin Radio Tower in the western part of the city, which was built in the 1920s.
In addition to its main function as the location of several radio and television transmitters, the building – internally known as &quot;Fernmeldeturm 32&quot; – serves as a viewing tower with observation deck including a bar at a height of , as well as a rotating restaurant. Also, the Berlin TV Tower can be booked as a venue for events. The distinctive city landmark has undergone a radical, symbolic transformation: After German reunification, it changed from a politically charged, national symbol of the GDR into a citywide symbol of a reunited Berlin. Due to its universal and timeless design, it has increasingly been used as a trademark and is identified worldwide with Berlin and Germany. In 1979, the Berlin TV Tower received official monument status by the East German government, a status which was perpetuated after the German reunification.

The tower has become one of the most prominent symbols of the country and is often in the establishing shot of films set in Berlin, alongside monuments such as the Brandenburg Gate, the Berlin Victory Column and the Reichstag building. It is also one of the ten most popular attractions in Germany with more than 1,000,000 visitors every year.

==Overview==
The original total height of the tower was , but it rose to after the installation of a new antenna in 1997. The Fernsehturm was the fourth tallest free-standing structure in Europe, after Moscow&#x27;s Ostankino Tower, the Kyiv TV Tower and the Riga Radio and TV Tower. The sphere is a visitor platform and a revolving restaurant in the middle of the sphere. The visitor platform, also called panoramic floor, is at a height of about above the ground and visibility can reach on a clear day. The restaurant &quot;Sphere&quot;, which rotates once every 30 minutes, is a few metres (yards) above the visitors platform at . When first constructed, it turned once per hour; the speed was later doubled following the tower&#x27;s 1997 renovation.

Two lifts transport visitors to the sphere of the tower within 40 seconds. There is also a stairway with 986 steps. Wheelchair users cannot visit the tower due to fire regulations.

To mark the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, for which the final match was played in the Berlin Olympic Stadium, the sphere was decorated as a football with magenta-coloured pentagons, reflecting the corporate colour of World Cup sponsor and owner of the Fernsehturm, Deutsche Telekom.

== Location and surroundings ==

The Berlin TV Tower is located southwest of the Alexanderplatz station, east of the St. Mary&#x27;s Church and northeast of the Marx-Engels Forum. The structure is often erroneously described as being part of the Alexanderplatz that lies to the northeast.

In addition to the Berlin U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines, several tram and bus lines stop at Alexanderplatz station, from which the middle exit leads to the entrance building of the TV Tower.

The Interhotel Stadt Berlin on Alexanderplatz, planned concurrently to the TV Tower and completed in 1970, is high and is now operated as a Park Inn by Radisson Berlin Alexanderplatz. Between 1967 and 1972, the Rathauspassagen shopping arcade was built next to the Rotes Rathaus, directly south of the TV Tower.

==History==
=== Background ===
At the European Broadcasting Conference in Stockholm in 1952, which was responsible for the coordination of frequency waves in Europe, the GDR – not recognised politically by most countries at the time – was only allocated two frequency channels. Under these circumstances, it was impossible to cover Berlin&#x27;s urban area by multiple small broadcasting stations without interference and thus disturbances or gaps in the broadcasting signals. For comprehensive and continuous coverage, a powerful large broadcasting facility at the highest possible location was required. In the 1950s, this task was fulfilled in Berlin by the fragile makeshift stations of Deutscher Fernsehfunk (East German broadcasting organisation).

As early as 1952, GDR&#x27;s Deutsche Post began planning a TV tower for Berlin. The plans initially involved a location in the southeast of Berlin. However, the project was interrupted after construction had started, when it transpired that the site was only eight kilometres (5 miles) away from the Berlin Schönefeld Airport (now part of Berlin Brandenburg Airport) and the tower threatened to jeopardise flight operations due to its height and location at the edge of an airport corridor. After various compromise solutions failed, the construction project was discontinued in 1956. In the following years, alternatives were sought and several sites were discussed, including in Berlin Friedrichshain, but these plans also fell victim to austerity measures triggered by the high costs of building the Berlin Wall.

In the next few years, the search for a new location was continued. Alongside its actual purpose of providing the best possible broadcasting services, the role of the tower as a new landmark of Berlin was increasingly gaining significance. For this reason, in 1964 the government demanded that the tower be built at a central location, an appeal that was supported by the SED leadership. Ultimately, the choice of location was a political decision. Walter Ulbricht, leader of the Socialist Unity Party which governed East Germany, decided to allow the construction of a television tower modelled on the Fernsehturm Stuttgart and the first artificial Earth satellite, Sputnik.

Various architects were involved in the planning and implementation of the tower between 1965 and 1969, including Hermann Henselmann and Jörg Streitparth, Fritz Dieter, Günter Franke and Werner Ahrendt, as well as Walter Herzog, Gerhard Kosel and Herbert Aust. The construction of the Tower and the surrounding Pavilion building at its base resulted in the razing and clearing of a huge section of the historic centre of the capital of Germany. A medieval church stands next to the tower as a testament to the destruction of the old city.

=== Construction of the Tower ===
Work on the foundation began on 4 August 1965 and was finished by the end of 1965. The concreting of the tower foot began on 15 March 1966. The concreting progressed rapidly, so that the 100-metre (300-foot) mark was exceeded on 4 October 1966. The shaft reached its final height on 16 June 1967. A total of 8,000 cubic metres (10,000 cu. yd.) of concrete was used to build the shaft, which was high and weighed 26,000 tons. 

While the shaft was being erected, the preliminary work for the tower ball progressed. The working group VEB Ipro had worked out the procedure for assembling the ball on the reinforced concrete shaft, according to which the ball could be pieced together from 120 separate segments on the ground. In April 1967, a 35-metre (115-foot) high replica of the shaft was erected on the construction site between Marienkirche and the Red Town Hall on which the ball segments were pre-assembled. This work lasted until November 1967. The construction costs had meanwhile skyrocketed from an estimated 33 million to 95 million marks, caused mainly by components and materials that had to be paid in foreign currencies, some of which were imported from West Germany. In February 1968, the assembly of the ball on the shaft was started. The last segment of the ball was finally installed on 7 October. A spike was mounted on the tower structure and the antenna structure above the ball, so that work on the interior could be started the following year.

At the beginning of 1969, water trickled into the interior of the tower, causing considerable damage; the ball had to be sealed again. Until 3 October 1969, the interior was expanded, and the entrance pavilion was completed. After 53 months of actual construction work, the tower was completed in &quot;record-breaking&quot; time in spite of all the adversities. The costs amounted to over 132 million marks.

The building, officially called the Fernseh- und UKW-Turm Berlin (Television and VHF Tower Berlin), was the world&#x27;s second highest television tower in October 1969. The only TV tower that was taller was the Ostankino in Moscow. It was also the third-highest freestanding building of its time, after the tower in Moscow and the Empire State Building in New York.

=== Since the inauguration ===
On 3 October 1969 Walter Ulbricht, together with his wife Lotte and a delegation of high-ranking companions, including Günter Mittag, Herbert Warnke, Paul Verner, Rudolph Schulze, Erich Honecker, Werner Lamberz and Erich Mielke, inaugurated the television tower and gave the starting signal for GDR&#x27;s second state channel, DFF 2, thus launching colour TV on two channels in the GDR. The tower has been accessible to the public since 7 October 1969, Republic Day.

From 16 February 1970, five FM programmes were broadcast from the tower; a first television programme followed on 4 April 1970. At the beginning of 1972, the two planned pavilions for exhibitions, the Berlin Information Centre, a cinema and gastronomic facilities were completed. Overall, the restaurants offered space for around 1000 guests. After the establishment of a legal basis for the preservation of monuments in 1975, the Berlin TV Tower was awarded this status in 1979. After the fall of the GDR, the Federal Republic of Germany enshrined the building&#x27;s monument status.

After German reunification in 1990, voices were raised favouring the demolition of the tower. The Federal Republic of Germany decided to keep the building. As the new operator, Deutsche Telekom finally invested more than 50 million marks to overhaul the broadcasting facilities, and a number of renovations were also undertaken on the building. Among other things, the antenna received a new, more powerful tip from the height of , increasing the tower&#x27;s height from originally to in summer 1997.

The TV Tower is one of the buildings in Berlin that is illuminated by a special light installation for several days during the Festival of Lights held every year in October since 2004. On the occasion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the tower ball was covered to make it look like a magenta football as part of an advertising campaign by the operator Telekom.

==&quot;Pope&#x27;s Revenge&quot;==
When the sun shines on the Fernsehturm&#x27;s tiled stainless-steel dome, the reflection usually appears in the form of a Greek cross. Berliners nicknamed the luminous cross &quot;Rache des Papstes&quot;, or the &quot;Pope&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, believing the Christian symbol a divine retaliation for the government&#x27;s removal of crosses from East Berlin&#x27;s churches. For the same reasons, the structure was also called &quot;St. Walter&quot; (from Walter Ulbricht). U.S. President Ronald Reagan mentioned this in his &quot;Tear down this wall&quot; speech on 12 June 1987.

== Visitors and tourism ==

The Berlin TV Tower is not only a broadcasting tower, but also a landmark, tourist attraction and venue. The TV Tower&#x27;s observation deck and revolving restaurant are run by Magnicity, a group based in France that operates attractions at the top of the Montparnasse Tower in Paris and 360 CHICAGO at the former John Hancock Center in Chicago, among others. The Berlin TV Tower is the highest publicly accessible building in Europe and was the highest publicly accessible observation platform in Germany until 2017, when the TK Elevator Test Tower in Rottweil has overtaken this rank. In the first three years after its inauguration, as many as four million people visited the structure. After the German reunification, the visitor average has levelled off to approximately 1.2 million from some 90 countries a year. Of these, around 60 per cent come from abroad, with Spaniards being the biggest group, accounting for 8.1 per cent, followed by Italians (7.6 per cent) and Danes (6.7 per cent). The maximum admissible number of persons inside the ball is 320 persons. Of the up to 5,000 visitors daily, about 1,500 visit the tower restaurant. In GDR times, the duration of a stay in the Tele-Café was limited to 60 minutes and in the observation deck to 30 minutes.

The two visitor elevators carry 12 people each in about 40 seconds to the observation platform at , where Berlin&#x27;s highest bar is also located. From 60 windows there is a panoramic view over the whole of Berlin and the surrounding areas. The restaurant, which is located 21 steps above the observation platform at altitude, rotates 360 degrees in an hour. For fire protection reasons, the main kitchen is located at the foot of the tower. The meals are transported by lift to the restaurant floor, where they are prepared in a small satellite kitchen. Apart from the two evacuation platforms below the tower basket, the fire protection concept includes a strict smoking ban throughout the entire structure. Wheelchair users and persons with current walking disabilities cannot visit the Berlin TV Tower, as they would not be able to use the escape route in case of emergency. Animals, prams and large luggage are also not admitted for safety reasons.

On 14 June 2011 – almost 42 years after the inauguration – the then Governing Mayor Klaus Wowereit welcomed the 50 millionth visitor. The entire city can be viewed from the observation deck of the TV Tower. If there is good visibility, the view reaches as far as the recreational park Tropical Islands Resort, at a distance of almost 60 kilometres (40 miles).

The TV Tower, which is open all year to the public, has seasonal opening times. The last ascent to the observation platform is daily at 11.30 pm, whereas the last admission to the restaurant is at 11 pm. The public area can be rented for special events, parties, receptions and other events with a maximum of 200 guests. Civil weddings can also be celebrated on the TV Tower. In this case, the bar area on the observation deck is reserved for an hour for the bridal couple and a wedding party of up to 30 guests.

<text>The Yamaha DX7 is a synthesizer manufactured by Yamaha Corporation from 1983 to 1989. It was the first successful digital synthesizer and is one of the best-selling synthesizers in history, selling more than 200,000 units.

In the early 1980s, the synthesizer market was dominated by analog synthesizers. Frequency modulation synthesis, a means of generating sounds via frequency modulation (FM), was developed by John Chowning at Stanford University, California. FM synthesis created brighter, glassier sounds, and could better imitate acoustic sounds such as brass and bells. Yamaha licensed the technology to create the DX7, combining it with very-large-scale integration chips to lower manufacturing costs.

With its complex menus and lack of conventional controls, few learned to program the DX7 in depth. However, its preset sounds became staples of 1980s pop music; in 1986, it was used in 40% of the number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100. Its electric piano sound was particularly widely used, especially in power ballads. The English producer Brian Eno was proficient at programming his own sounds, and it was instrumental to his work in ambient music. Chips based on the DX7 sound chip, such as the YM2612, were used in technologies such as the Sega Genesis game console. 

The DX7 was succeeded by FM synthesizers including the DX1, DX21, DX27 and DX100. In later years, the DX7 sounds came to be seen as dated or clichéd and its use declined.

== Development ==
By the mid-20th century, frequency modulation (FM), a means of carrying sound, had been understood for decades and was widely used to broadcast radio transmissions. In the 1960s, at Stanford University, California, John Chowning developed FM synthesis, a means of using FM to generate sounds different from analog synthesis. In 1971, to demonstrate its commercial potential, Chowning used FM to emulate acoustic sounds such as organs and brass. Stanford patented the technology and hoped to license it, but was turned down by American companies including Hammond and Wurlitzer. Chowning felt their engineers did not understand FM.

At the time, the Japanese company Yamaha was the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of musical instruments but had little market share in the United States. One of their chief engineers visited Stanford to view the technology. According to Chowning, &quot;In ten minutes he understood ... I guess Yamaha had already been working in the digital domain, so he knew exactly what I was saying.&quot; Yamaha licensed the technology for one year to determine its commercial viability, and in 1973 its organ division began developing a prototype FM monophonic synthesizer. In 1975, Yamaha negotiated exclusive rights for the technology. 

Ikutaro Kakehashi, the founder of the Japanese company Roland, was also interested, but met Chowning six months after Yamaha had agreed to the deal. Kakehashi later said Yamaha were the natural partners in the venture, as they had the resources to make FM synthesis commercially viable. Yamaha created the first hardware implementation of FM synthesis. The first commercial FM synthesizer was the Yamaha GS1, released in 1980, which was expensive to manufacture due to its integrated circuit chips. At the same time, Yamaha was developing the means to manufacture very-large-scale integration chips. These allowed the DX7 to use only two chips, compared to the GS1&#x27;s 50. Yamaha also altered the implementation of the FM algorithms in the DX7 for efficiency and speed, producing a sampling rate higher than Stanford&#x27;s synthesizers. Chowning felt this produced a noticeable &quot;brilliant&quot; sound.

Yamaha displayed a prototype of the DX7 in 1982, branded the CSDX in reference to the Yamaha CS range of analog synthesizers. In late 1982, Dave Bristow and Gary Leuenberger, experts on the Yamaha CS-80, flew to Japan to develop the DX7&#x27;s voices. They had less than four days to create the DX7&#x27;s 128 preset patches.

== Features ==
Compared to the &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;fuzzy&quot; sounds of analog synthesizers, the digital DX7 sounds &quot;harsh&quot;, &quot;glassy&quot; and &quot;chilly&quot;, with a richer, brighter sound. Its presets constitute &quot;struck&quot; and &quot;plucked&quot; sounds with complex transients. Its keyboard spans five octaves, and the keyboard expression allows for velocity sensitivity and aftertouch. The DX7 has 16-note polyphony, meaning 16 notes can sound simultaneously. It has 32 sound-generating algorithms, each a different arrangement of its six sine wave operators. The DX7 was the first synthesizer with a liquid-crystal display, and the first to allow users to name patches.

== Sales ==
The DX7 was the first commercially successful digital synthesizer and remains one of the bestselling synthesizers in history. According to Bristow, Yamaha had hoped to sell more than 20,000 units. Within a year, orders exceeded 150,000 units, and Yamaha had sold 200,000 units after three years. 

The DX7 was the first synthesizer to sell more than 100,000 units. Yamaha manufactured units on a scale American competitors could not match; by comparison, Moog sold 12,000 Minimoog synthesizers in 11 years, and could not meet demand. The FM patent was for years one of Stanford&#x27;s highest earning. Chowning received royalties for all of Yamaha&#x27;s FM synthesizers.

According to Dave Smith, the founder of the synthesizer company Sequential, &quot;The synthesizer market was tiny in the late 70s. No one was selling 50,000 of these things. It wasn&#x27;t until the Yamaha DX7 came out that a company shipped 100,000-plus synths.&quot; Smith said the DX7 sold well as it was reasonably priced, had keyboard expression and 16 voices, and was better at emulating acoustic sounds than competing products. Chowning credited the success to the combination of his FM patent with Yamaha&#x27;s chip technology.

== Impact ==
At the time of release, the DX7 was the first digital synthesizer most musicians had used. It was very different from the analog synthesizers that had dominated the market. According to &quot;MusicRadar&quot;, its &quot;spiky&quot; and &quot;crystalline&quot; sounds made it &quot;the perfect antidote to a decade of analog waveforms&quot;. It was praised for its accuracy in reproducing tubular bells, metallophones and the harpsichord, and took over the electric piano market.
With complex submenus displayed on an LCD and no knobs and sliders to adjust the sound, many found the DX7 difficult to program. &quot;MusicRadar&quot; described its interface as &quot;nearly impenetrable&quot;, with &quot;operators, algorithms and unusual envelopes ... accessed through tedious menus and a diminutive display&quot;. Rather than create their own sounds, most users used the presets.

The presets were widely used in 1980s pop music. Ryuichi Sakamoto was an early DX7 user, utilizing it for Mari Iijima&#x27;s debut city pop album &quot;Rosé&quot; in 1983 and his solo electronic music album &quot;Ongaku Zukan&quot; (&quot;Illustrated Musical Encyclopedia&quot;) in 1984. The &quot;BASS 1&quot; preset was used on songs such as &quot;Take On Me&quot; by A-ha, &quot;Danger Zone&quot; by Kenny Loggins, and &quot;Fresh&quot; by Kool &amp; the Gang. The &quot;E PIANO 1&quot; preset became particularly famous, especially for power ballads, and was used by artists including Whitney Houston, Chicago, Phil Collins, Luther Vandross, Billy Ocean and Celine Dion. In 1986, it was used in 40% of the number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100, 40% of country number ones, and 60% of RnB number ones. The preset imitates a Rhodes piano, prompting some to abandon the Rhodes in favor of the DX7.

A few musicians skilled at programming the DX7 found employment creating sounds for other acts. The English musician Brian Eno learned to program the DX7 in depth and used it to create ambient music on his 1983 album &quot;&quot;. He shared instructions for recreating his patches in a 1987 issue of &quot;Keyboard&quot;. Eno used the DX7 on records he produced by U2 and Coldplay. In later years, the DX sounds came to be seen as dated or clichéd, and interest in FM synthesis declined, with second-hand digital synthesizers selling for less than analog. The development of software synthesizers such as Native Instruments FM8 led to a resurgence in the popularity of FM synthesis.

== Successors ==
According to &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;, throughout the mid-1980s, &quot;Yamaha flooded the market with a plethora of low-cost FM synths.&quot; In 1987, Yamaha released the DX7II, which did not match the success of the DX7. Further successors included the TX81Z, DX1, DX11, and DX21. Yamaha manufactured reduced versions of the DX7 sound chip, such as the YM2612, for use in technologies such as the Sega Genesis game console. In 2015, Yamaha released a smaller FM synthesizer, the Reface DX.

<doc id="486337" wikidata="Q1967954" url="?curid=486337" title="ReBirth RB-338">
<text>ReBirth RB-338 is a software synthesizer for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS 8-9 and iOS for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. It was developed by Propellerhead Software, and its first alpha version (for Mac OS) was publicly released in October 1996. Propellerhead Software ceased developing the original program in January 1999. Support for desktop versions was officially discontinued in September 2005. Shortly afterward, the ReBirth Museum Web site was launched and the last desktop version&#x27;s (2.0.1) disk image was made available as a free download and torrent. Propellerhead Software continues to develop other software relating to dance-oriented computer-based music composition, including Reason, its flagship software synthesizer, as well as portable &quot;app&quot; versions of ReBirth.

==Features==
ReBirth emulates two Roland TB-303 synthesizers and a Roland TR-808 since v1.0, and also a Roland TR-909 drum machine since v2.0. All emulations can be used simultaneously. Each of the emulated devices has its own pattern selector, a feature the original devices are lacking. This allows fast switches between different musical sequences, and re-programming the TB-303 for playing different notes, for instance, is rendered unnecessary. This feature has been adopted in some of Reason&#x27;s devices. ReBirth also features mixers, a pattern controlled filter (PCF) and some of the standard effects in software synthesizers like delay, compressor and distortion.
The program also supports user modifications, which may replace the samples in the drum machine emulations and modify the GUI. There are four modifications included in the ReBirth installation by default (though the default ReBirth GUI seems to count as a modification as well).

The virtual knobs and controls can be assigned to physical counterparts via MIDI, so knobs, modulation wheels, faders and other performance controls available on keyboards and modules can be used to shape the software sound.

==Critical reception==
ReBirth was an early software synthesizer, pioneering this class of instruments along with Cubase, Cakewalk, Digital Performer, and Reality in 1997, with a low-CPU-utilization, leading the PC software market, with the low specs of then cutting-edge computers. The sound quality during live playback (as opposed to saving the generated sound to disk), assuming that the CPU could cope with the sampling rate, was imposed by the quality of the sound card.

Some enthusiasts have criticized ReBirth&#x27;s software emulation of the TB-303 as being an inferior copy of the genuine sound. Such criticism is common to many software synths that emulate analog synthesis (which the TB-303 featured), due to the reputedly inimitable sound of analog synthesis, and quality degraded by low-end sound cards. Despite this, Roland contacted Propellerhead Software to give it an unofficial thumbs up, which Propellerhead considered to be the Roland seal of approval.

== Free download ==
As of September 2005, support for ReBirth was discontinued by Propellerhead software, and the software became available online as a free download.

==iPhone and iPad==
In April 2010, ReBirth was re-released as a paid app for the iPhone and iPod Touch. In November 2010 a visually revamped and modernized version was made available on the iPad.

Propellerhead disabled ReBirth For iOS on 1 June 2013. The app was officially removed from the App Store on 15 June 2017, following an official claim from Roland of intellectual property infringement.

<text>The Aalto University School of Business (; ), is the largest business school in Finland. Founded in 1911, it is the second oldest business school in Finland and one of the oldest business schools in the Nordic countries. The school became part of Aalto University on 1 January 2010. It has been previously known as the Helsinki School of Economics, the Helsinki School of Economics and Business Administration, and during 2010–2012 the Aalto University School of Economics.

The Aalto University School of Business is the first business school in the Nordic countries to have received the Triple Crown accreditation (accreditations from the three largest and most influential business school accreditation organizations: AACSB, AMBA, and EQUIS).

In terms of admissions, the school is considered the most difficult business school in Finland. In 2019, the school had the highest number of applicants for any higher education program in Finland. It also had the lowest acceptance rate of any business school in the country.

==History==

The Aalto University School of Business was established in Helsinki in 1904 by the business community and was given the status of a university in 1911. It operated as a private university until 1974 when the state of Finland was given the financial responsibility of the university. Nevertheless, the school has remained autonomous in its administration and internal affairs. Since its founding, 23,000 students have graduated. In 1950, the School of Business moved from Fabianinkatu to Runeberginkatu in Töölö. The school became a part of Aalto University on 1 January 2010 and fully transitioned to its Otaniemi campus in 2019.

==Rankings and accreditations==
The Aalto University School of Business has been accredited by all three major international organizations that certify business schools (AACSB, AMBA, EQUIS), a &quot;triple-crown&quot; accreditation possessed by only 55 other universities in the world. The school is also a member of the CEMS (Global Alliance in Management Education) and PIM (Partnership in International Management).

Since 2005, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; has ranked the CEMS program among the top masters in management programs in the world. The Aalto University School of Business is an active member of this joint program. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; ranked the Aalto University School of Business 29th in the European business school rankings in 2013, 78th in Global MBA programs, and 43rd in Master in Management programs.

==Degrees and programmes==
The school offers university degrees in economics and business administration at the bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, licentiate, and doctoral levels, along with MBA programmes targeted to business professionals hosted through Aalto University Executive Education.

The school has a two-step program structure, accordingly to the Bologna Treaty, with a three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree followed by a two-year master&#x27;s degree. New students start by studying towards a BSc degree in economics and business administration and on completion, are eligible to continue to study for the master&#x27;s degree. A doctoral degree normally takes four additional years.

===Bachelor&#x27;s programmes===
Since 2013, the school offers the following bachelor&#x27;s programmes (3-year programme, 180 ECTS credits):
* Economics and business administration (in Otaniemi, Espoo, in Finnish)
* Economics (in Otaniemi, in English)
* International business (in Mikkeli, in English).

In economics and business administration, students may choose one of the following as their major: Accounting, business law, economics, finance, information service and management, management, marketing

===Master&#x27;s programmes===

===Summer programmes===
Since 1995, the school has offered a multidisciplinary summer programme called the Information Technology Program (3-month programme, 24 ECTS credits). The school also offers a multidisciplinary Business Master Class summer course (2-week course, 6 ECTS credits).

==MBA programs==
MBA and executive MBA programs are offered by the Aalto University Executive Education AEE with operations in Helsinki, China, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Sweden and Iran. There is a tuition fee in the MBA program, unlike in the BSc/MSc degree programs. The MBA program is taught through two-week modules by visiting faculty from some of the best business schools in the world, including Emory University, Rutgers Business School, University of South Carolina, Georgetown University, University of California, Concordia University, Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston, Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Indiana University, ESADE and INSEAD.

==Admissions==
Each year, around 400 students are admitted into the bachelor&#x27;s programmes and around 200 students to the master&#x27;s programmes. Bachelor&#x27;s admissions are based mainly on an admissions test (in Finnish) and the nationwide matriculation examination. Non-Finnish speakers and international students have the opportunity to gain admission through the SAT (Scholastic Admissions Test) conducted in English. Applicants with an appropriate bachelor&#x27;s degree may apply for the master&#x27;s admission to taking only the degree of Master of Science in economics and business administration.

==Partner universities==
The Aalto University School of Business has exchange partnerships with over 150 universities on six different continents. Each year, close to 400 students go abroad on their exchange and the school welcomes over 350 incoming exchange students. The school collaborates with the leading business schools in Europe within the CEMS community. Partner schools include Imperial College in the UK, HEC Montréal in Canada, WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management in Germany, NCCU College of Commerce in Taiwan, Yonsei University in South Korea, Peking University in China, Sophia University in Japan, Duke University, University of South Carolina in the US and Skema Business School and ESCP Business School in France.

<text>A surface-wave-sustained discharge is a plasma that is excited by propagation of electromagnetic surface waves. Surface wave plasma sources can be divided into two groups depending upon whether the plasma generates part of its own waveguide by ionisation or not. The former is called a self-guided plasma. The surface wave mode allows the generation of uniform high-frequency-excited plasmas in volumes whose lateral dimensions extend over several wavelengths of the electromagnetic wave, e.g. for microwaves of 2.45 GHz in vacuum the wavelength amounts to 12.2 cm. 

==Theory==
For a long time, microwave plasma sources without a magnetic field were not considered suitable for the generation of high density plasmas. Electromagnetic waves cannot propagate in over-dense plasmas. The wave is reflected at the plasma surface due to the skin effect and becomes an evanescent wave. Its penetration depth corresponds to the
skin depth formula_1, 
which can be approximated by 

:formula_2

The non-vanishing penetration depth of an evanescent wave opens an alternative way of heating a plasma: Instead of &quot;traversing&quot; the 
plasma, the conductivity of the plasma enables the wave to propagate &quot;along&quot; the plasma surface. The wave energy is then transferred to the plasma by an evanescent wave which enters the plasma perpendicular to its surface and decays exponentially with the skin depth. Transfer mechanism allows to generate over-dense plasmas with electron densities beyond the critical density.

==Design==
Surface-wave-sustained plasmas (SWP) can be operated in a large variety of recipient geometries. The pressure range accessible for surface-wave-excited plasmas depends on the process gas and the diameter of the recipient. The larger the chamber diameter, the lower the minimal pressure necessary for the SWP mode. Analogously, the maximal pressure where a stable SWP can be operated decreases with increasing diameter. 

The numerical modelling of SWPs is quite involved. The plasma is created by the electromagnetic wave, but it also reflects and guides this same wave. Therefore, a truly self-consistent description is necessary.

<doc id="486344" wikidata="Q4356679" url="?curid=486344" title="Fortean Times">
<text>Fortean Times is a British monthly magazine devoted to the anomalous phenomena popularised by Charles Fort. Previously published by John Brown Publishing (from 1991 to 2001), I Feel Good Publishing (from 2001 to 2005), Dennis Publishing (from 2005 to 2021), and Exponent (2021), as of December 2021 it is published by Diamond Publishing, part of Metropolis International.

In December 2018, its print circulation was just over 14,800 copies per month. The magazine&#x27;s tagline is &quot;The World of Strange Phenomena&quot;.

==History==

===Origin===
The roots of the magazine that was to become &quot;Fortean Times&quot; can be traced back to Bob Rickard&#x27;s discovering the works of Charles Fort through the secondhand method of reading science-fiction stories: &quot;John Campbell, the editor of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (as &quot;Analog&quot; was then titled), for example,&quot; writes Rickard, &quot;encouraged many authors to expand Fort&#x27;s data and comments into imaginative stories.&quot;

In the mid-1960s, while Rickard was studying product design at Birmingham Art College, he met several like-minded science-fiction fans, particularly crediting fellow student Peter Weston&#x27;s fan-produced &quot;Speculation&quot; magazine as helping him to &quot;[learn] the art of putting together a fanzine&quot;, some years before he created his own. Attending a science-fiction convention in 1968, Rickard obtained Ace paperback copies of all four of Fort&#x27;s books from a stall run by Derek Stokes (later to run Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed, and take a role in the day-to-day running of &quot;The Fortean Times&quot;).

After reading an advertisement in the underground magazine &quot;Oz&quot; (in 1969) for the International Fortean Organization (INFO), an American group &quot;founded in 1966... by Paul and Ronald Willis,&quot; who had acquired material from the original Fortean Society (started in 1931, but in limbo since the 1959 death of its founder Tiffany Thayer), Rickard began to correspond with the brothers, particularly Paul. Rickard was instrumental in encouraging the Willises to publish their own Fortean journal – the &quot;INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown&quot; began intermittent publication in spring, 1967 – and sent them many British newspaper clippings, although few came to print.

Rickard later discovered that the production was fraught behind-the-scenes, as Ronald Willis had been seriously ill, Paul thus finding it difficult to &quot;keep up with things&quot; on his own. Ultimately, the Willises were instrumental in inspiring Rickard to create his &quot;own&quot; periodical. Ron Willis succumbed to a brain tumour in March 1975. Bearing a date of November 1973, the first issue of Rickard&#x27;s self-produced and self-published &quot;The News&quot; was available directly from him.

===&quot;The News&quot; (1973–1976)===
The magazine which was to continue Fort&#x27;s work documenting the unexplained was founded by Robert J. M. &quot;Bob&quot; Rickard in 1973 as his self-published, bimonthly, mail-order &quot;hobbyish newsletter&quot; miscellany &quot;The News&quot; — &quot;A Miscellany of Fortean Curiosities&quot;. The title is said to be &quot;a contraction taken from Samuel Butler&#x27;s &quot;The News from Nowhere&quot;&quot;, (although Rickard may be conflating/confusing Butler&#x27;s &quot;Erewhon&quot; and William Morris&#x27; &quot;News from Nowhere&quot;). &quot;The News&quot; had fairly regular bimonthly publication for 15 issues between November 1973 and April 1976. Debuting at 35p (£1.80/$4.50 for a year of six issues) for 20 pages, &quot;The News&quot; was produced on Rickard&#x27;s typewriter, with headings created with Letraset, during (as Rickard says in #2) the late-1970s blackouts. The first issue featured a cover (which would become briefly the unofficial logo of &quot;The News&quot;) drawn by Rickard from a Selfridges advertisement originally created by Bernard Partridge. From the second issue, pictures and photographs from various newspapers were interpolated within the text. The price was raised slightly for #6 — which also had its page count upped to 24 pages — due in large part to rising postal and paper costs.

Helping behind the scenes was Steve Moore, a kindred spirit whom Rickard met at a comics convention when the latter was a subeditor at IPC. The two found they had much in common, including a love of Chinese mysticism, and Moore helped inspire Rickard to publish &quot;The News&quot;. The early issues featured some articles by different individuals, but were &quot;largely the work of Bob Rickard, who typed them himself with some help from Steve Moore.&quot;

====Key &quot;News&quot;-people====
Moore and Paul Screeton (then editor of &quot;The Ley Hunter&quot;), both urged on the first few uncertain issues&quot; and Moore frequently joined Rickard to &quot;stuff envelopes and hand-write a few hundred addresses&quot; to disseminate the early issues. Rickard also highlights amongst the key early &quot;Fortean Times&quot; advocates and supporters: Ion Alexis Will, who discovered &quot;The News&quot; in 1974 and became a &quot;constant [source] of valuable clippings, books, postcards, and entertaining letters&quot;; Janet and Colin Bord, later authors of &quot;Mysterious Britain&quot; (Janet also wrote for &quot;Flying Saucer Review&quot; and Lionel Beer&#x27;s &quot;Spacelink&quot;, while Colin&#x27;s Fortean article in &quot;Gandalf&#x27;s Garden&quot; was particularly cited by Rickard as bringing him/them to his attention); Phil Ledger, a &quot;peripatetic marine biologist&quot;, and &quot;The News&quot;&#x27; &quot;first enthusiastic fan&quot;; Ken Campbell, Fortean theatre director and playwright; John Michell; graphic designer Richard Adams and Dick Gwynn, who both helped with the evolving layout and typesetting of later issues; Chris Squire, who helped organise the first subscription database; Canadian &quot;Mr. X&quot;; Mike Dash; and cartoonist Hunt Emerson. Emerson was introduced to Rickard in late 1974, when after seven issues, he &quot;wanted to improve the graphics&quot;, which Emerson certainly did, providing around 30 headings for use in issues #8 onwards. (Emerson&#x27;s still-on-going monthly &quot;Phenomenomix&quot; strip in &quot;FT&quot; had its prototype in #11&#x27;s three-page &quot;Fortean Funnies&quot;).

====Notable &quot;News&quot; content====
Other early contributors included writer and researcher Nigel Watson (chairman of the Scunthorpe UFO Research Society), who wrote &quot;Mysterious Moon&quot; for &quot;The News&quot; #2. Watson later wrote a regular column of UFO commentary entitled &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; (from #29), and articles on the subject of UFO-related murders and stories of sexual assault by aliens. Phil Grant wrote about Ley lines for #3, and Mary Caine, who revised an earlier article (from &quot;Gandalf&#x27;s Garden&quot;) on The Glastonbury Zodiac for issue #4, which also had the debut of the &quot;Reviews&quot; section, beginning with comments on a book by John Michell, the &quot;Sphere&quot; reprint of Charles Fort&#x27;s &quot;New Lands&quot; and John Sladek&#x27;s &quot;The New Apocrypha&quot;.
Issues #2 and #3 noted, &quot;The News&quot; was published &quot;with an arrangement with INFO&quot;, this was revised from #4 to it being &quot;affiliated to the International Fortean Organization&quot;. From #5, Mark A. Hall produced a section entitled &quot;Fortean USA&quot;, continuing on from his earlier, discontinued, newsletter &quot;From My Files&quot;; issue #5 also had William Porter&#x27;s article on Llandrillo printed, after being delayed from #4 for space constraints. Janet Bord contributed &quot;Some Fortean Ramblings&quot; alongside William R. Corliss&#x27;s &quot;The Evolution of the Fortean Sourcebooks&quot; for #7, and issue #8 was the first issue of volume 2, after Rickard decided to end volume 1 with #7 (not #6 as fully bimonthly titles do), since that issue was dated November &#x27;74, thereby attempting to keep each volume aligned with a year.

Issue #8 (or, volume 2, issue #1) got the special &quot;Christmas present&quot; of headings by Hunt Emerson, after Rickard was introduced to Emerson by Carol and Nick Moore, as Hunt was working on &quot;Large Cow Comix&quot;. Described by Rickard as &quot;as much a disciple of George [Herriman]... and my [Rickard&#x27;s] favourite artists from &quot;Mad&quot; (Bill Elder and Wally Wood)&quot; as Rickard was of Charles Fort, the two got on well, with Emerson producing not only a series of headings, but also later strips and covers for issues to the present. The death of INFO co-founder Ron Willis was announced in #9, which described itself as providing &quot;bimonthly notes on Fortean phenomena&quot;, and an index to the first year&#x27;s issues (#1–7) became available. Colin Bord penned &quot;Amazing Menagerie&quot; for issue #10, while Paul Devereux and Andrew York compiled an exhaustive study of Leicestershire in &quot;Portrait of a Fault Area&quot;, serialised in #11–12. Issue #11 featured Rickard and Emerson&#x27;s first &quot;Fortean Funnies&quot; cartoon, while #12 had a price rise to 50p/$1.25, a logo change (from Selfridges&#x27; herald-on-horseback to the more descriptive Fort&#x27;s face-encircled) and a tweaking of its tagline to &quot;bimonthly &quot;news &amp;&quot; notes on Fortean phenomena.&quot; Issue #14 first mentioned Rickard and Michell&#x27;s then-in-production book &quot;Phenomena!&quot;, which would be more actively trailed from #18. Issue #15 — now with 28 pages — announced that Rickard had decided to bow to popular opinion and retitle his miscellany with a more descriptive title. Thus, with a subtitle of &quot;Portents &amp; Prodigies&quot;, &quot;Fortean Times&quot; was born.

===&quot;Fortean Times&quot; (since 1976)===
After 15 issues of &quot;The News&quot;, issue #16 (1976) had the magazine renamed &quot;Fortean Times&quot;, which &quot;new title emerged from correspondence between Bob Rickard and Paul Willis&quot; — the two having talked of creating a Fortean version of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, &quot;full of weird and wonderful news and read by millions worldwide&quot;. Its cover bore the descriptive text &quot;Strange phenomena — curiosities — prodigies — portents — mysteries,&quot; while the inside cover kept the &quot;Fort face&quot; logo from later issues of &quot;The News&quot;, but bore the revised legend &quot;A Contemporary Record of Strange Phenomena&quot;. Included within was an offer for a &quot;4-colour silk-screened poster&quot; created by Hunt Emerson for this landmark issue. From the start, this new format compounded earlier financial difficulties for Rickard, following on from #14&#x27;s plea: &quot;we need more subscribers or we die!&quot;. (&quot;Fortean Times&quot; issues #16–18 — as &quot;The News&quot; #1–15 before them — were solely edited, published, and in large part written and typed by Rickard himself. Even by passing on rising postal and paper costs to the readership, which Rickard constantly reiterates that he is loath to do, the early &quot;Fortean Times&quot; was constantly facing an uphill financial battle.) Early editorials of the new &quot;FT&quot;, therefore (in fact beginning with &quot;The News&quot; #15) featured a notification of donations received, naming and thanking the hardcore readership (which included many current and future contributors) for monies received, which aided the move towards higher production values. With donations helping to offset costs, the price was held at 50p until issue #20, whereupon the magazine dropped to a quarterly schedule from Spring 1977 (issue #21) — but raised the page count (and price) to continue producing the same amount of material for the same yearly fee (40 pg, 75p ea. or £3/year).

Issue #18 received a new semiregular feature entitled &quot;Forteana Corrigenda&quot;, aimed at correcting &quot;errors in the literature&quot; that had crept into various Fortean works through misquotation or other difficulties. After 18 more-or-less solo-produced issues, long-term supporter and helper Steve Moore was credited as assistant editor for issues #19–21, becoming co-contributing editor (with Phil Ledger, Stan Nichols, and Paul J. Willis) on issues #22–26 and associate editor from issue #27. He was joined by contributing editor David Fideler, and subsequently (also as co-associate editor) by Paul Sieveking (#28— ) and Valerie Thomas (#31–32). Issue #20 announced that Kay Thompson (a staff member of &quot;Ley Hunter&quot; magazine, then under the editorship of Paul Devereux, with whom &quot;FT&quot; shared an address for several issues) would be helping to type parts of subsequent issues to further delegate the burden from Rickard. Moore, Sieveking, and he were also later joined editorially by author Mike Dash (who is mentioned as particularly overseeing the publication of scholarly occasional papers), before Moore moved from full editorial to largely correspondent duties for a dozen issues after #42, returning as a contributing editor in Autumn 1990 (#55). The four — Rickard, Sieveking, Dash, and Moore — are often collectively referred to as &quot;the Gang of Fort&quot;, after the Gang of &quot;Four&quot;.

Issue #21 had the debut of &quot;FT&quot; semiregular column &quot;Strange Deaths&quot; (later descriptively subtitled &quot;Unusual ways of shuffling off this mortal coil&quot;), while issue #22 updated &quot;FT&quot;&#x27;s to include The Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained, alongside INFO. Issue #23 featured an article by Robert Anton Wilson on, aptly, &quot;The 23 Phenomenon,&quot; made available a second index (1975, to &quot;The News&quot; #8–13) and included a 12-page &quot;Review Supplement&quot;, issued as a separately bound supplement since the then-printers had difficulty binding more than 40 pages. With #24, the printers were changed to Windhorse Press to overcome this difficulty, and &quot;FT&quot; became officially 52 pages in length, the changes cemented in issue #25 with a new font for the title and a change of address — c/o London-based &quot;SF and cosmic&quot; bookshop Dark They Were and Golden-Eyed, run by Derek Stokes (who had sold Rickard the four Fort books 10 years previously). The same issue ran an obituary for Eric Frank Russell, of whom Rickard was a considerable fan. He writes that Russell turned down an invitation to contribute material to &quot;The News&quot; back in 1973, having &quot;earned his rest&quot; after 40 years as an active Fortean. Rickard further states that Russell was one of the key Fortean-fiction writers he read in Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Analog&quot;, and the author of &quot;the first Fortean book I [Rickard] ever read&quot;: Russell&#x27;s &quot;Great World Mysteries&quot;. Issue #26 trailed &quot;a special series of &#x27;Occasional Papers&#x27; in Fortean subjects&quot; to be edited by Steve Moore, and #27 — the 5th Anniversary issue — welcomed Michigan-native David Fideler (whose &quot;Anomaly Research Bulletin&quot; was then due to cease publication, although its subscribers, &quot;FT&quot; promised, would be absorbed by them) as &quot;FT&quot;&#x27;s &quot;man in the New World&quot;.

====Paul Sieveking and &quot;FT&quot;&#x27;s format change====
In 1978, mutual friend Ion Will introduced Rickard to Paul Sieveking, who recalls, &quot;the Forteans used to meet every Tuesday afternoon above the science-fiction bookshop Dark They Were And Golden-Eyed in Soho to open post and interact. (Indeed, this was the semiofficial address of &quot;FT&quot; until that shop closed. With #35, Summer &#x27;81, the address was changed.) Sieveking joined the &quot;FT&quot; team with #28 as co-associate editor, and writes, highlighting the intrinsic early difficulties in printing &quot;FT&quot; that that issue &quot;was printed by an Israeli entrepreneur in northern Greece and shipped to London.&quot; That issue (#28), bearing a cover blurb of &quot;Strange Phenomena&quot;, featured an early advertisement for the bookshop Dark They Were And Golden-Eyed, drawn by Bryan Talbot, while the editorial promised that the &quot;next&quot; issue would not only see the availability of Index 1976, but also be in a &quot;larger and more professional format, typeset throughout, [with] better graphics, layout, and legibility.&quot;

Indeed, #29, under a cover by Hunt Emerson, was printed fully typeset in A4 (thanks to art director Richard Adams of AdCo, and,according to Rickard&#x27;s preface to &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s News Tomorrow&quot;, Dick Gwynn) and even distributed on a limited basis through WH Smiths. The move away from production on Rickard&#x27;s typewriter gave &quot;The &quot;Journal&quot; of Strange Phenomena,&quot; (as it was now subtitled) greater ability to produce longer, better laid-out articles. These opened with a seven-page guide to &quot;Charles Fort and Fortean Times&quot; by Bob Rickard, explaining the background and philosophy of &quot;FT&quot;, as well as outlining the influence of Fort, &quot;who is still largely unknown&quot;, writes Rickard, and also included the first of Nigel Watson&#x27;s &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; columns and Loren Coleman&#x27;s &quot;Devil Names and Fortean Places&quot; article sat alongside comments by Colin Bord, Tim Dinsdale, V. G. W. Harrison, and Rickard on Anthony &#x27;Doc&#x27; Shiels&#x27; 1977 &quot;Nessie&quot; photographs. The magazine itself dropped the description &#x27;non-profitmaking&#x27; from its publication information, and ceased to name its stated affiliations to INFO, SITU, and &quot;other Fortean journals&quot; in favour of the more general aim to be a &quot;friend to all groups and magazines continuing the work of Charles Fort&quot;. It also contained a considerably higher number of advertisements, including both inside covers — making the page count slightly higher than previous issues, which had previously counted the cover as page 1 — and an early advertisement by Brian Bolland for Forbidden Planet (which would ironically begin to take off only after the closure of Stokes&#x27; bookshop).

Issue #30 announced that while &quot;over the last couple of issues [the] subscriber list... nearly doubled,&quot; so too had the &quot;printing, production, and postage bill,&quot; necessitating a price rise to 95p/$2.50 — albeit softened by another length increase, to 68 pages. Now published not merely by Rickard, but by Fortean Times Ltd, it was typeset by Warpsmith Graphics and printed by Bija Press. The cover was painted by Una Woodruff (whose &quot;Inventorum Natura&quot; was reviewed within) to illustrate John Michell&#x27;s article on &quot;Spontaneous Images and Acheropites,&quot; drawing on his 1979 Thames &amp; Hudson book dealing with — and titled — &quot;Simulacra&quot;. Bob Rickard produced an article on one &quot;Clemente Dominguez: Pope, Heretic, Stigmatic&quot;; Michael Hoffman speculated on the occult aspects of a serial killer in &quot;The Sun of Sam&quot;; Robert J. Schadewald wrote about &quot;The Great Fish Fall of 1859&quot;, while Hunt Emerson produced the first cartoon strip under the title &quot;Phenomenomix&quot;.

Sieveking took over full editorial duties from Rickard with #43, helming the subsequent four quarterly issues (to #46) to give Rickard a chance to &quot;revitalize&quot;, which he did, returning with #46 to the position of co-editor. Moore, Dash, and Ian Simmons (and others) variously edited the magazine for the next 18+ years, and although main editorship passed from Rickard and Sieveking to David Sutton in 2002, they both continued to contribute. Sieveking semiretired at the end of 2019, handing most of the &quot;Strange Days&quot; news editor role to Christopher Josiffe. Sieveking continues to write the archaeology column, compile the &quot;Extra, Extra&quot; section, and edit the letters pages, also acting as the main quality-control proof-reader (as well as producing an occasional feature). Sieveking&#x27;s wife Val Stevenson was book-review editor for several years, eventually passing this role on to David V. Barrett in 2019.

During the 40+ years of its publication, &quot;Fortean Times&quot; has changed both format and publishers on a few occasions. Early issues (particularly of &quot;The News&quot;) were produced in black and white (for ease of photocopying), and the whole was largely produced by typewriter until #29. Colour, professional printing, and wider distribution followed, and a 6.5- x 4.5-in size held sway for several years before the magazine settled into its &quot;normal&quot; A4 (magazine) size in the 1980s, after which glossy covers followed. Several changes of logo and font have occurred throughout its life.

==General content==
The identification of correct original sources by contributors is a defining feature of the magazine, as it was for Charles Fort himself. However, the &quot;objective reality&quot; of these reports is not as important. The magazine &quot;maintains a position of benevolent scepticism towards both the orthodox and the unorthodox&quot; and &quot;toes no party line&quot;. 
The range of subject matter is extremely broad, including:

* General Forteana
* Anomalous phenomena
* Apparitions
* Bizarre deaths
* Conspiracy theories
* Crop circles
* Cryptozoology
* Cults and would-be Messiahs and prophets
* Fringe science
* Hoaxes
* Millennialism, eschatology, and cases of mass hysteria
* Mutants (human and animal)
* Parapsychology
* Religious phenomena (stigmata, appearances and simulacra and miracles, etc.)
* Natural simulacra
* Unidentified flying objects
* Urban legends

&quot;Fortean Times&quot; also frequently covers the Ig Nobel Prizes, as well as unusual aspects of mainstream science and research.

===Current content===
The magazine&#x27;s current regular contents include:
* Three or four feature articles
* Strange Days, a wide-ranging overview of odd and interesting stories mostly culled from the world&#x27;s newspapers. Some feature in particular sections, including:
** &quot;Science&quot;
** &quot;Archaeology&quot; (usually by Paul Sieveking and Paul Devereux)
** Ghosts, in a column titled &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; (by Alan Murdie) 
** &quot;Alien Zoo&quot;, Dr. Karl Shuker&#x27;s regular discussion of cryptozoological matters
** &quot;Necrolog&quot;, obituaries of Fortean-relevant individuals
** &quot;Strange deaths&quot;, a long-running round-up of the odd manners in which some people meet their ends
** &quot;UFO Files/Saucers of the Damned&quot; is by Nigel Watson who provides a &quot;regular survey of the latest fads and flaps from the world of ufology&quot;; &quot;UFO Files/UFO Casebook&quot; is Jenny Randles&#x27; &quot;round-up of sightings and hot-spots from around the world&quot;
:&quot;Clippings for most of Strange Days&#x27; stories are requested from, and supplied by, the readers of&quot; &quot;FT&quot;
* Mythconceptions, which debunks modern myths, old wives&#x27; tales, etc. (in a similar manner to, for example, Snopes.com)
* Classical Corner, in which Barry Baldwin reviews Fortean events from ancient times
* Fortean Bureau of Investigation, which typically revisits and reassesses older Fortean cases
* Forum, featuring three or four shorter articles on diverse topics
* Reviews of Fortean, science fiction/fantasy and related books, films and computer games
* A letters page, incorporating:
**&quot;Simulacra Corner&quot;, photographs submitted by readers of (typically) naturally occurring objects which appear to be in the shape of something else
**&quot;it happened to me...&quot;, readers’ stories of strange personal occurrences
* Fortean Traveller, “a guide to various sites of interest to the traveling Fortean”
* Phenomenomix, a comic strip by Hunt Emerson

==Praise and criticism==
Most of the articles in &quot;Fortean Times&quot; are written in the style of objective journalism, but this is not a mandatory requirement, and some articles focus on a specific theory or point of view. Although such articles are presented as the opinion of the author and not the editors (who claim to have no opinions), this has occasionally led to controversy. In January 1997, the magazine ran an article by David Percy under the headline &quot;FAKE! Did NASA hoax the moon landing photos?&quot;. The article outraged many readers and led to the magazine&#x27;s most vigorous postbag up to that time. In August 2000, the magazine&#x27;s cover headline was &quot;UFO? The shocking truth about the first flying saucers&quot;. The article in question, by James Easton, proposed a mundane explanation for Kenneth Arnold&#x27;s sighting — American white pelicans. This suggestion so outraged ufologists that many of them still use the term &quot;pelican&quot; or &quot;&quot; as a pejorative term for a debunker.

Most Fortean researchers contribute articles, criticism, or letters to the magazine. It has also attracted more widespread coverage and praise. &quot;Fortean Times&quot; #69 claims, &quot;extracts from &quot;FT&quot; have featured in at least three publications used for teaching English as a foreign language.&quot; Lynn Barber of &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; newspaper described writing in &quot;FT&quot; as &quot;a model of elegant English.&quot;

==UnConvention==
The magazine has organised an &quot;UnConvention&quot; (or &quot;UnCon&quot;), most years since 1994 (the &quot;missing&quot; years being 2001, 2005, and 2009), at various venues in London (the University of London Union, the Institute of Education, the Commonwealth Institute, and in recent years, Friends House). Many &quot;hot topics&quot; of the day have been discussed, such as the Ray Santilli &quot;alien autopsy&quot; film at the 1996 UnCon, and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales at the 1998 event, which also saw Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince discussing Templar conspiracies and hidden symbolism in the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci, years before these were turned into mass-media subjects by &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. Besides the formal lecture programme, UnCon normally features exhibits by organizations such as the Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena and the Centre for Fortean Zoology. The event often ends with a panel discussion, as was the case in 2002, when the subject was &quot;Is Ufology Dead?&quot;. This was widely reported in the British media as an &quot;official&quot; statement by &quot;Fortean Times&quot; that &quot;Ufology is Dead&quot;.

==Related projects==
&quot;Fortean Studies&quot;, the magazine&#x27;s more academic sister publication published yearly volumes in the late 1990s. The seventh and last issue was published in 2001.

Its website tracks Fortean news stories and holds a small archive of articles and photographs. For many years, it also supported a busy internet forum for the discussion of Fortean topics. With the advent of GDPR legislation in 2018, this forum was moved to the website of the Charles Fort Institute.

The magazine has also occasionally published both academic and lighthearted books on various aspects of Forteana.

==Collections and spin-off books==
Many of the earliest issues of &quot;FT&quot; were collected in book format in the early 1990s. In recent years, the print volumes have been overtaken by digital files, available on CD. In addition, several smaller collections have been compiled on various themes and sold, or given away as &#x27;free gifts&#x27; with the magazine. A more academic journal, &quot;Fortean Studies&quot;, has also been printed and is an ongoing venture. In the late 1990s Polygram Spoken Word released an audio version of several Fortean stories, written and produced by Steve Deakin-Davies and featured Brian Cant and Joanna Bowen amongst its actors, this project was licensed from John Brown Publishing.( (c) 1997 Polygram Record operations ltd, Speaking Volumes no: 5361444)

===Fortean Tomes===
Starting in the very early 1990s, &quot;Fortean Times&quot; produced a number of facsimile editions collecting the earliest issues of the magazine, in their entirety, including advertisements. These collections, prepared and edited for print by Paul Sieveking (including hand corrections to early typographic errors) are now out-of-print. Although demand was such to warrant reprints of several volumes, after collecting up to #77 &quot;FT&quot; decided that the previous volumes had not sold well enough to continue completely up to date. (Concern over the likely cost of reprinting issues in the new full colour format led to a publishing decision to stockpile 500 unbound run-on copies of each number to provide the basis of future reprint editions, and this project resulted in one further collection — &quot;Snakes Alive!&quot;, collecting #93–97 — but the in-between issues #78–92 have not yet been collected in trade format.)

====CDs====
Around 2005, &quot;FT&quot; began to release a series of digital archives. Beginning with more recent issues (presumably for reasons of ease — more recent issues would be more readily available as digital files), they have also begun to re-release the earliest issues — apparently the digital archive CD format has taken over from print collections.

===&quot;Fortean Studies&quot;===
A sister publication, &quot;Fortean Studies&quot;, began in the mid-1990s and was edited by Steve Moore. In the words of frequent contributor Neil Nixon, it &quot;compiled serious research and opinion on a range of paranormal and conspiracy-related issues&quot;, and was a more academic counterpart to &quot;FT&quot;.

<text>Adelaide Fringe, formerly Adelaide Fringe Festival, is Australia’s biggest arts festival and is the world&#x27;s second-largest annual arts festival (after the Edinburgh Festival Fringe), held in the South Australian capital of Adelaide. Between mid-February and mid-March each year, it features more than 7,000 artists from around Australia and the world. Over 1,300 events are staged in hundreds of venues, which include work in a huge variety of performing and visual art forms. The Fringe features many free events occur alongside ticketed events for the duration of the festival.

In 2023 Adelaide Fringe became the first festival in Australia to sell 1 million tickets. This has doubled from 500,000 tickets in 2015. 

The main temporary venue hubs are The Garden of Unearthly Delights, Gluttony and the Wonderland and 500 other temporary and permanent venues hosting Fringe events are scattered across the city, suburbs and region. In a period in Adelaide&#x27;s calendar referred to by locals as &quot;Mad March&quot;, other events running concurrently are the Adelaide Festival of Arts, another major arts festival starting a week after the Fringe, which includes Adelaide Writers&#x27; Week and the four-day world music festival WOMADelaide, and also the Adelaide 500 street circuit motor racing event, with accompanying evening music concerts.

The Fringe attracts many international visitors as well as from all over Australia, and in 2019 generated an estimated in gross economic expenditure for South Australia, which included in spending by the 2.7 million attendees. Each year has brought a new record in all aspects of the festival for many years up to 2020.

Founded in 1960 as a loose collection of official (coordinated by the Festival of Arts) and unofficial events run by local artists, and initially seen as adjunct to the main Festival of Arts, the Fringe became an incorporated body in 1975, with the 1976 festival named Focus and later Adelaide Festival Fringe, before the 1992 change to Adelaide Fringe Festival. It has grown from a two-week long, biennial festival to a major annual international festival.

The Edinburgh Award, worth , was introduced by Arts South Australia in 2017, open to local Adelaide Fringe artists who wish to tour their work to the Edinburgh Fringe.

== Governance ==
The Adelaide Fringe and Adelaide Festival of Arts are separate organisations, with different philosophies and intent.

The Adelaide Fringe is governed by the Adelaide Fringe Board, which employs a director and CEO, a deputy director and a large team of adjunct staff to manage various aspects of the festival. A number of major contributors to the history of the Fringe have been named as life members, including the founder, the late founder, Frank Ford.

As of January 2025, Heather Croall is the CEO and director, having been appointed in 2015. Greg Clarke was CEO and director 2011–2014. Sandy Verschoor was CEO 2006–2010, while Christie Anthoney filled the post of director from when the Fringe went annual in 2007 to 2010; and Karen Hadfield for the 2004 and 2006 festivals.

==Description==
 Adelaide Fringe is the second-largest annual arts festival in the world, after the Edinburgh Fringe, and the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, places it won in 2017, and it continues to grow each year. Artists from across the globe participate in the Fringe alongside home-grown talent, in all art forms. Adelaide Fringe also organises its own public events. The Adelaide Fringe is an open-access event, meaning that there is no curator seeking out the events which form part of the programme.

&quot;Mad March&quot; is a term used by locals to describe the period of five big events running concurrently in the local calendar: the Adelaide Festival of Arts (a three-week festival starting a week after the Fringe), which includes Adelaide Writers&#x27; Week and the four-day world music festival WOMADelaide, as well as the Adelaide 500 street circuit motor racing event, with accompanying its evening music concerts. 

Adelaide Fringe begins with free opening night celebrations (for many years a street parade and/or opening night party; an opening ceremony followed by party), and free as well as ticketed events continue for the duration of the month-long festival. The festival includes contemporary work in a wide range of art forms including cabaret, comedy, circus and physical theatre, dance, film, theatre, puppetry, music, visual art, magic, digital and interactive and design.

==Venues==
In 2019 there were 517 venues, which included &quot;pop-up&quot; venues in parks, warehouses, laneways and disused buildings, as well as established venues such as theatres, hotels, bars, pubs, art galleries and cafes. Buskers regularly perform in Rundle Mall and elsewhere in and around the city as well as in the suburbs.

Accessibility has been greatly improved in recent years, with a number of initiatives included to try to ensure that as many venues and events are able to be attended by people of all abilities.

Because of Adelaide city centre&#x27;s compact size, many of the venues are fairly close to each other. The city&#x27;s surrounding parks provide several clusters of venues (known as venue hubs), outside of the established and converted venues within the city and suburbs. There are three main venue hubs:
* The Garden of Unearthly Delights, the group of venues set up within a temporarily fenced area of Rundle Park / Kadlitpina, was first used in 2000, with only one Spiegeltent, known as &quot;The Famous Spiegeltent&quot;.
* Gluttony, a similarly fenced venue hub over the road in Rymill Park/Mullawirraburka.
* The Royal Croquet Club has had a few changes of location since its launch in Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga in 2014, first to Pinky Flat/Tarntanya Wamain the northern parklands, then within the University of Adelaide from 2019.

Some of the permanent establishments regularly hosting Fringe events have included the Holden Street Theatres (a converted church precinct turned venue in Hindmarsh), Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute, Bakehouse Theatre (a performing arts space in the CBD), The German Club in Flinders Street, The Rhino Room (a local comedy club), the Odeon Theatre, Norwood and the National Wine Centre (a convention centre with wine bar and restaurant). Small venues make up about 50% of ticket total sales. The popular live music venue &quot;The Gov&quot; is used for Fringe events of all kinds.

==Adelaide Fringe Ambassadors==
In 2012, the Government of South Australia partnered with the South Australian Tourism Commission to create the Adelaide Fringe Ambassador role to promote the Adelaide Fringe across Australia and overseas. The Adelaide Fringe Ambassador also participates in the Adelaide Fringe Opening Night Parade and performs during the Fringe.

== History ==
=== 1960–1974: Biennial, 2–3 weeks, status unclear ===

The first &quot;fringe&quot; event came about in 1960, when a few artists decided to stage their own events in response to the exclusion of many local and smaller-scale artists from the curated Adelaide Festival of Arts. Fringe activities consisted of local visual arts, crafts, performing arts and amateur theatre groups organising productions, exhibitions and events alongside the Festival and running for two weeks. According to Fringe Vault, &quot;These events that have been called &#x27;unofficial fringe activities&#x27; formed the beginnings of the &#x27;Fringe&#x27;. These were seen as separate to any &#x27;unofficial activity supported by the festival&#x27; which were listed in the 1960 &quot;Festival of Arts Festival Souvenir Programme&quot; under &quot;Festival Attractions, other Events and other Exhibitions&quot;&quot;.

In 1962, the number of unofficial local events and exhibitions grew to the point where, according to a thesis by Martin Christmas, &quot;1962 appears to have been the Festival where it was recognised that &#x27;ancillary&#x27; (fringe activities), were as important as the core cultural activities&quot;, and Max Harris wrote an article entitled &quot;Adelaide’s Two Festivals&quot;.

In 1964, Fringe was host to 52 art exhibitions, collections and performances. Like the Festival of Arts, it was held biennially, for three weeks. Both approved and unapproved events had grown in number. Significant productions of two Patrick White plays, &quot;The Ham Funeral&quot; and &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;, staged by local performers in 1961 and 1964 respectively after being refused by the main Festival, served to cement the status of what started being referred to in the press as &quot;Fringe&quot; events.

In 1970, the event grew to three weeks in duration, running from 6–28 March that year and experiencing significant growth in both official and unofficial events and including three major musical performances, four dance performances, an opera, film events and exhibitions.

The first printed souvenir programme was published for the 1974 event, with the title as &quot;Adelaide Festival of Arts, March 9 to 30: Fringe programme&quot;. However there were still a large number of unofficial events: the programme listed 41 exhibitions listed and 20 performances; unofficial events included 50 exhibitions, 10 performances and many other events.

=== 1976–2006: Biennial, 3 weeks, established ===
====1976: Focus====
In 1975 the fringe became an incorporated association, and thus &quot;legal&quot;, with writer and director Frank Ford as its founding chairman. Its name was Focus Inc., with the focus on the development of South Australian culture. The change of name caused some controversy at the time, but the reason was reinforce the notion that Focus was not a cultural cringe. The first independently organised Fringe, known as Focus Festival, came into being and was seen as a huge success. This was the true beginning of today&#x27;s Adelaide Fringe, as a separate entity and with focused goals, and the first dedicated poster, proclaiming &quot;Focus &#x27;76&quot;. The 1978 poster said: &quot;Focus: Adelaide&#x27;s Festival of the Australian Arts&quot;. 
====1982: Adelaide Festival Fringe====
In 1982, the name on the poster, with a design by Pro Hart, changed to Adelaide Festival Fringe. In that year there were 50 venues, 86 groups or individual artists, as well as 56 visual arts exhibitions in the city venues. There were also 16 groups doing performances in schools and public spaces. In 1988 the festival opened its doors to international artists, and the early 1990s brought further big changes, creating the most successful festival yet. It was beginning to put itself on the map internationally. The brochures stated that it was &quot;the biggest community arts festival in Australia&quot; and &quot;ranked second only, behind the internationally renowned Edinburgh Festival Fringe&quot;. The inaugural Opening Night Hindley Street Party was thrown, and patron Don Dunstan called on the state government to provide more funding.
====1992-4: Adelaide Fringe Festival====
In 1994, the name on the posters changed from Adelaide Festival Fringe to Adelaide Fringe Festival, as a result of changes brought about in 1992-3. It decided to adopt the name Adelaide Fringe and to broaden the role of the organisation. Dubbed &quot;the affordable festival&quot;, the 1992 festival was the most successful in its 32 year history, with many of the events taking place in the newly-completed Lion Arts Centre on the western end of North Terrace. The 1994 poster showed &quot;Adelaide Fringe Festival&quot;, in contrast to the recent past &quot;Adelaide Festival Fringe&quot;.

In 1998, the used its own especially developed ticketing system, FringeTix, for the first time.

====2000: Adelaide Fringe====
The 2000 Fringe dropped the &quot;Festival&quot; and started calling itself the Adelaide Fringe. That year was dedicated to dedicated to former state premier and fringe patron Don Dunstan, embracing his vision of social justice and cultural diversity that continues to be an inspiration today. 

In 2006 South Australian Premier Mike Rann announced that the Adelaide Fringe would receive extra government funding (totalling $2 million) to enable it to become an annual event from 2007 onwards. 

=== 2007–2012: Annual, 3 weeks ===

In 2007, the Adelaide Fringe became an annual event, after receiving funding from the state government of , which was deemed a success. In 2007, 130,000 tickets were sold through the FringeTIX box office system – with an additional 10,000 ticket sales by national ticketing partners.

In 2008, about 187,000 tickets were sold through the FringeTIX box office and their ticketing partners. 281 Fringe venues sold tens of thousands of tickets on the door. Family Day became Family Weekend and doubled in size and attendances. The final box office income was estimated to reach over , the majority of which was passed back to Fringe artists.

In 2009, pre-event ticket sales equalled that of the previous year. 2,800 artists featured in 250 venues across the city, in 508 comedy, theatre, music, dance and visual art shows.

The Adelaide Fringe celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010. Compared to the previous year ticket sales were 27% higher. For the first time, Fringe sold 100,000 tickets prior to the opening parade. The event received extra State Government funding of to support the anniversary event. The grant covered the cost of producing eight inflatable astronauts and erecting them around the city. 300,000 tickets were sold at box offices, more than twice as many as were sold in 2007.

In 2011, the Fringe Parade was cancelled due to rain, but 334,000 tickets were sold, equating to over . 1.45 million attendances were recorded and ticket sales had increased 11% over the previous year.

The 2012 festival ran from 24 February to 18 March. Approximately 40,000 spectators attended the Fringe Parade, and 367,000 tickets were sold, a 10% increase on 2011 sales. Ticket sales equated to an approximate value of . The event featured over 4,000 artists and 923 events, in 300 venues. There were 20% more events than in 2011. CEO Greg Clarke launched the event not only in Adelaide, but also at the Sydney Opera House and in Federation Square in Melbourne. There were also two big changes on opening night: the parade ran down the centre of the city along King William Street, and the celebrations before, during and afterwards were not just in the East End of the city centre, but in Fringe venues everywhere. There were also a number of large free outdoor events during the festival.

=== 2013–2020: Annual, 4 weeks ===
In 2013, after a boost in government funding, Fringe was extended to run for a 4-week period, commencing Friday 15 February. There were over 4,000 artists registered, appearing in 930 events and 6139 performances, and 407,153 tickets were sold. The dollar value of ticket sales equated to . The event generated , which was an increase of 34% on the previous year.

In 2014, the festival ran for 30 days and nights from 14 February until 16 March, and brought together over 4,000 artists from around Australia and the world. Over 900 events were staged in pop-up venues in parks, warehouses, lane-ways and disused buildings as well as established venues such as theatres, hotels, art galleries and cafes.

====Heather Croall, 2015–present====
In February 2015, Heather Croall came on board as CEO and Festival Director. More than worth of tickets were sold, made up of more than 536,000 tickets sold across 376 venues, resulting in an increase of 20% compared to the previous year.

Ticket sales for the 2016 Adelaide Fringe Festival rose 12% on the previous year, with more than 600,000 tickets sold. More than 1,100 performances were staged across 430 venues. British comedian Alexis Dubus vowed not to perform in future Adelaide Fringe Festivals, citing his reason as the festival being driven by larger venues, which attract crowds who buy drinks instead of show tickets, leading to poor ticket sales and cancellations for shows. (However, he returned to the Adelaide Fringe Festival in 2018.)

In April 2016, the &quot;Made in Adelaide&quot; initiative was announced by the state government, which provided funds totalling to support nine acts taking their work to the Edinburgh Fringe, to help build connections between the two festivals. In August 2016, the Fringe began an official partnership with the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Among the acts was a live audio drama of Matthew Reilly&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;Ice Station&quot;.

In November 2016, CEO Croall spoke of the need for better marketing to attract more tourists, and ways to help ensure that artists received a decent share of income.

The start date of the 2017 festival was postponed by a week to 17 February, with the March long weekend falling on weekend four of the festival, instead of the last weekend. It was in 2017 that it became the largest arts festival in the Southern Hemisphere, and the second largest Fringe in the world. 

Adelaide Fringe 2018 once again broke all records, attracting 2.7 million people in attendance across free and ticketed events, including 100,000 for the Opening Night Street Party (which replaced the opening night Parade) and 505,000 for the Parade of Light digital projections onto the buildings along North Terrace on every night of the 31-day festival. More than 6,900 artists performed in 1,231 events across 442 venues. Box office revenue reached from 705,761 tickets sold (up 7 per cent). The event also saw a greater share going into artists&#x27; pockets, after of funding from the state government enabled the Fringe to abolish inside charges for artists with tickets under $35, and to halve those for all others. The move was praised by artists, including Dubus, who returned with a new show that year.

Records were again broken in 2019, with attendance by tourists increased by 72% on the previous year (possibly a consequence of increased interstate marketing), a total of nearly 3.3 million attendances, and in estimated expenditure. 7000 artists participated in 1326 events. The reach of Fringe has been pushing further out of the boundaries of Adelaide, into regional centres.

====2020: 60th anniversary====
The Fringe celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2020. While the 2020 Fringe was the first in years to see a decrease in the number of registered events (&quot;over 1200&quot;, compared with 1320 in 2019), the events were more widely spread, with half of the venues outside Adelaide city centre, including both suburban and regional locations such as Stirling, Gawler and Murray Bridge.

The World Fringe Congress, first held in 2012, was held in Adelaide for the first time in 2020.

The last weekend of the festival was somewhat impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, although government rules on social distancing and travel did not start until the following week. Nonetheless it brought in a record $96.7 million in estimated gross economic expenditure, with box office revenue also hitting a record $21 million, selling 853,419 tickets.
====2021====
Dates were announced for the 2021 Fringe (19 February – 21 March), but future planning was hampered by uncertainty caused by the global pandemic and consequent greater financial risk to performers and venues. However, the festival did go ahead, with 40,000 tickets sold by 18 February 2021. It proved to be the largest arts festival in the world in both 2020 and 2021, with South Australia not as badly affected as many places by the pandemic.

== Notable mascots ==

In 2010, eight giant -high inflatable astronauts, created by Mr Inflatables, were placed around Adelaide.

The 2014 event&#x27;s mascot was Stobie the Disco Cuttlefish, a -long street performance puppet inspired by the giant cuttlefish of South Australia. Stobie the Disco Cuttlefish flashed multi-coloured lights, waved its tentacles and played pre-recorded disco music while a group of professional dancers performed original choreography each Saturday night during the event.

The 2018 mascot was inspired by the winning poster of that year, featuring a multi-coloured dog made of balloons, with a crown, created by Sydney graphic designer Jacqueline Daniel. It was intended to celebrate the Chinese Year of the Dog.

<text>The Adelaide Festival of Arts, also known as the Adelaide Festival, an arts festival, takes place in the South Australian capital of Adelaide in March each year. Started in 1960, it is a major celebration of the arts and a significant cultural event in Australia.

The festival is based chiefly in the city centre and its parklands, with some venues in the inner suburbs (such as the Odeon Theatre, Norwood) or occasionally further afield. The Adelaide Festival Centre and River Torrens usually form the nucleus of the event, and in the 21st century Elder Park has played host to opening ceremonies.

It comprises many events, usually including opera, theatre, dance, classical and contemporary music, cabaret, literature, visual art and new media. The four-day world-music event, WOMADelaide, and the literary festival, Adelaide Writers&#x27; Week, form part of the Festival. The festival originally operated biennially, along with the (initially unofficial) Adelaide Fringe; the Fringe has taken place annually since 2007, with the Festival of Arts going annual a few years later, in 2012. With all of these events, plus the extra visitors, activities and music concerts brought by the street-circuit motor-racing event known as the Adelaide 500, locals often refer to the time of year as &quot;Mad March&quot;.

The festival attracts interstate and overseas visitors, and generated an estimated gross expenditure of million for South Australia .

==History==
The Adelaide Festival began with efforts by Sir Lloyd Dumas in the late 1950s to establish a major arts festival that would bring to South Australia world-class cultural exhibitions. In 1958, Sir Lloyd organised a gathering of prominent members of the Adelaide business, arts and government community. The proposal for an event similar to the Edinburgh International Festival was supported and the first Festival Board of Governors was formed. 
The event began to take form when Sir Lloyd partnered with John Bishop, Professor of Music at the University of Adelaide. The two gained the support of the Lord-Mayor and Adelaide City Council and a financial backing of 15,000 pounds. A number of leading businesses sponsored the first festival, including &quot;The Advertiser&quot;, the Bank of Adelaide, John Martin &amp; Co., the Adelaide Steamship Company, and Kelvinator.

The inaugural Adelaide Festival of Arts ran from 12 to 26 March 1960 and was directed by Bishop with some assistance from Ian Hunter, the artistic director of the Edinburgh Festival. There were 105 shows covering almost all aspects of the arts. In its first year, it also spawned the Adelaide Fringe, which has grown into the largest event of its kind in the world after the Edinburgh Fringe.

The Adelaide Festival continued to grow in successive years with the support of the South Australian Government. It developed a number of incorporated events including Adelaide Writers&#x27; Week, Australia&#x27;s original literary festival; WOMADelaide, the world music festival; and, the Adelaide Festival of Ideas. The Adelaide International was a curated international contemporary visual arts program held in partnership with the Samstag Museum from 2010 to 2014.

After some difficulties under the directorship of Peter Sellars in 2001–2, it was once again regarded as very strong, with its reputation intact as the pre-eminent event in the country, by 2006.

The Adelaide Festival moved from a biennial to annual event from 2012.

David Sefton was appointed as artistic director for a three-year tenure in 2013, then extended for another year. The 2013 program included for the first time, a three-night &quot;festival within a festival&quot;: &quot;Unsound Adelaide&quot; presented international artists playing multi-dimensional electronic music.

Neil Armfield and Rachel Healy were appointed in 2015 and took over from Sefton as co-artistic directors from the 2017 festival, which included the landmark opera production of Barrie Kosky&#x27;s &quot;Saul&quot;. Their contracts were extended twice, and due to finish with the 2023 festival. However, the 2021 and 2022 festivals were affected by frequently changing restrictions imposed by the government due to various waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Australia, which was challenging for the organisers, and also Armfield had some health issues.

In March 2022 it was announced that Ruth Mackenzie would be taking over from 2023, although Armfield and Healy had already confirmed or organised most of the major events for the festival. In August 2024 it was announced that Mackenzie had been appointed Program Director, Arts, Culture and Creative Industries Policy within the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, and that former Brett Sheehy would take over the role as AD until a new one is appointed for the 2026 festival.

==Governance and funding==
In 1998 the Adelaide Festival Corporation was established as a statutory corporation by the &quot;Adelaide Festival Corporation Act 1998&quot; (AFC Act), reporting to the Minister for the Arts. From about 1996 Arts SA (later Arts South Australia) had responsibility for this and several other statutory bodies such as the South Australian Museum and the Art Gallery of South Australia, until late 2018, when the functions were transferred to direct oversight by the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, Arts and Culture section. There is a governing board which reports to the minister. the chair was Judy Potter.

Artistic directors are appointed on fixed contracts for one or more years. There is a separate director of Writers&#x27; Week.

Funding is mainly from government sources, but, as a charitable body, the festival also attracts private donors within Australia and internationally. During the tenureship of Neil Armfield and Rachel Healy as co-artistic directors, donations to the festival increased from around a year in 2017 to A$2 million in 2022. In June 2019, it was announced that the Festival would receive in annual funding over the following three years, to help &quot;continue to attract major performances and events&quot;. In August 2023 the South Australian Government announced $2.3 million for the Adelaide Festival over three years for additional performances and events.

==Past festivals==
Neil Armfield and Rachel Healy hold the record for the most stints as director, with six festivals under their belt.

There were no directors for the festivals of 1966 and 1968, with an advisory board taking on the responsibility. Peter Sellars&#x27; brief directorship of the 2002 Adelaide Festival remains the most controversial and he was eventually replaced by Sue Nattrass.

<text>Ero s onoga svijeta (usually translated as Ero the Joker, literally &quot;Ero from the other world&quot;) is a Croatian comic opera in three acts by Jakov Gotovac, with a libretto by Milan Begović based on a folk tale. The genesis of the opera was at Vrlička Česma in the town of Vrlika, a hometown of Milan Begović.

According to Croatian musicologist Josip Andreis, &quot;Ero s onoga svijeta&quot; is &quot;not only the most successful Croatian comic opera to this day, but also the only Croatian opera with a presence in the theaters abroad&quot;. American musicologist and music critic Ralph P. Locke described it as one of two major Croatian operas, alongside &quot;Nikola Šubić Zrinski&quot;.

==Characters==
* Marko, &quot;rich peasant&quot;, bass
* Doma, &quot;his second wife&quot;, mezzo-soprano
* Đula (Djula), &quot;Marko&#x27;s daughter from the first marriage&quot;, soprano
* Mića (Ero), &quot;young man from the nearby village&quot;, tenor
* Sima, &quot;millman&quot;, baritone
* Shepherd boy, child soprano
* A young man, tenor
* girls (6 solos), women (8 solos), men, shepherds, fruit-merchants (4 solos), merchants (4 solos), children and other village people.

The opera takes place in a small town, somewhere in the plain at the foothill of Dinara mountain in Herzegovina, in early autumn.

==Orchestra==
* 3 Flauti (III muta in Piccolo), 2 Oboi, Corno Inglese, 3 Clarinetti, 2 Fagotti (II muta in Contrafagotto)
* 4 Corni in F, 3 Trombe in C, 3 Tromboni, Tuba
* Timpani, Percussioni, Arpa, Pianino
* I Violini, II Violini, Viole, Violoncelli, Contrabassi
* &quot;Sul palco&quot;: Organo

==History==

Composition of the opera began on October 10, 1932 and progressed in three stages, being finished on May 8, 1935. The first performance was on November 2, 1935 at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, and the opera has since become the most performed work of South Slavic music literature.

The first performance was conducted by Gotovac himself, and he felt that the opera was nicely received by the audience. In &quot;Novosti&quot; (hr), described the opera in superlatives, and in &quot;Belgrade Pravda&quot; Stražičić shared this positive sentiment. An often-quoted dismissive opinion (&quot;And again a Croatian composer wrote an opera in vain&quot;) allegedly found in Lujo Šafranek-Kavić&#x27;s review in &quot;Jutarnji list&quot;, a Zagreb-based newspaper, has been found by recent research to be a fabrication. The actual review was generally very positive, with Šafranek-Kavić giving particular praise to Gotovac&#x27;s score, while having reservations about the quality of the libretto.

&quot;Ero the Joker&quot; saw its first performance outside Yugoslavia in Brno, Czechoslovakia, translated into Czech in 1936, and after that it came back to the National Theater (&quot;Narodno pozorište&quot;) in Belgrade, Yugoslavia on April 17, 1937. It was next put on stage more than ten years later, on February 27, 1948, in the Serbian National Theatre (&quot;Srpsko narodno pozorište&quot;) in Novi Sad where it has been put on five times since. All totaled, Ero the Joker has found its way to the stages of more than 80 world theaters, and has been translated into 9 languages. Between 1935 and 2010 it has seen 660 performances in the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb alone.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
On the threshing floor of a rich peasant, Marko, young women are singing while threshing grain. Only master Marko&#x27;s daughter Djula is sad because her mother had died and her stepmother, Doma, does not care for her at all. Djula&#x27;s voice awakes Mića, a young man whom nobody knows.

While the women are comforting Djula and starting to sing again, Mića slides down from a big haystack on which he had been lying unnoticed - as if he had fallen from the sky. The superstitious women believe him when he says: &quot;I am Ero from another world!&quot;

He starts weaving a story about life &quot;up there&quot; and delivering messages from their deceased loved ones. Djula&#x27;s stepmother comes out and complains about their idleness. However, Mića convinces her to return to the kitchen by deceit. Left alone with Djula, he tells her that her late mother has chosen him to be her husband.

While they are discussing how to get her father, Marko, to consent to their marriage, her father himself appears and drives Mića off, refusing to give shelter to the scoundrel.

Doma, who had also heard of this young man from &quot;another world&quot;, seeks out Mića and asks him about her late husband, Matija. Mića tells her that, having heard about her new marriage and her lack of respect for him, Matija is furious. Mića adds that his pockets are empty and Doma, in a pang of conscience, hands him a sock full of gold coins to give to Matija when he sees him next. Mića joyfully leaves. However, when Marko finds out about the money, he gathers men to go after Mića.

===Act II===
At the local mill, Sima, the miller, mills and sings joyfully as the women start gathering. Each one of them claims to be in a rush and Sima doesn&#x27;t know how to please them all. When Doma arrives with Djula, she insists they be served at once, which leads to an all-round quarrel. Djula tries to calm her stepmother down, but Doma doesn&#x27;t listen and leaves fuming. Djula laments after her ill fate and Sima comforts her before she leaves with the other women.

Then, we see Mića on the run. He had disguised himself as a miller&#x27;s apprentice. When the angry mob catches up with him, they are unable to recognize him and Mića tells them he had seen someone running towards the mountains. The mob decides to leave their horses behind and continue the pursuit on foot. Then, Djula appears, and Mića assures her that he had taken the coins just to make as a ruse, and then persuades her to run away with him. When Marko and men return, a young shepherd informs them that he saw Mića and Djula fleeing on Marko&#x27;s horse.

===Act III===
At the fair, a throng howls cheerfully. Marko and Doma arrive quarrelling, since he does not want to give her any money for shopping. She leaves exasperated. Sima, the miller, approaches Marko and tells him that Djula had married a rich boy from the neighbouring village with whom she now lives happily.

Djula longs to see her father again, but Mića refuses to take her home without Marko&#x27;s invitation. Marko agrees to send for them, and when Mića and Djula arrive, the villagers give them a warm reception.

Finally, Mića decides to tell his true story. Following his mother&#x27;s advice, he left home pretending to be a poor boy, hoping to find a girl who will love him simply for who he is. He gives back Marko&#x27;s horse and hands him the gold coins he had taken from him, and asks for Marko&#x27;s blessing. Marko forgives him and is happy for the young couple. A big celebration erupts and the story comes to an end with a great kolo finale.

<text>A formula editor is a computer program that is used to typeset mathematical formulas and mathematical expressions.

Formula editors typically serve two purposes: 
* They allow word processing and publication of technical content either for print publication, or to generate raster images for web pages or screen presentations.
* They provide a means for users to specify input to computational systems that is easier to read and check than plain text input and output from computational systems that is easy to understand or ready for publication.

Content for formula editors can be provided manually using a markup language, e.g. TeX or MathML, via a point-and-click GUI, or as computer generated results from symbolic computations such as Mathematica.

Typical features include the ability to nest fractions, radicals, superscripts, subscripts, overscripts and underscripts together with special characters such as mathematical symbols, arrows and scalable parentheses.

Some systems are capable of re-formatting formulae into simpler forms or to adjust line-breaking automatically, while preserving the mathematical meaning of a formula.

==Available systems==

* TeX, a typesetting system designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth
* LaTeX, a document markup language and document preparation system for the TeX typesetting program
* MathML, an application of XML for describing mathematical notations and capturing both its structure and content. It aims at integrating mathematical formulae into World Wide Web pages and other documents. It is a recommendation of the W3C math working group

<text>Peter David Lax (born Lax Péter Dávid; 1 May 1926) is a Hungarian-born American mathematician and Abel Prize laureate working in the areas of pure and applied mathematics.

Lax has made important contributions to integrable systems, fluid dynamics and shock waves, solitonic physics, hyperbolic conservation laws, and mathematical and scientific computing, among other fields.

In a 1958 paper Lax stated a conjecture about matrix representations for third order hyperbolic polynomials which remained unproven for over four decades. Interest in the &quot;Lax conjecture&quot; grew as mathematicians working in several different areas recognized the importance of its implications in their field, until it was finally proven to be true in 2003.

==Life and education==
Lax was born in Budapest, Hungary to a Jewish family. He began displaying an interest in mathematics at age twelve, and soon his parents hired Rózsa Péter as a tutor for him. His parents Klara Kornfield and Henry Lax were both physicians and his uncle Albert Kornfeld (also known as Albert Korodi) was a mathematician, as well as a friend of Leó Szilárd.

The family left Hungary on 15 November 1941, and traveled via Lisbon to the United States. As a high school student at Stuyvesant High School, Lax took no math classes but did compete on the school math team. During this time, he met with John von Neumann, Richard Courant, and Paul Erdős, who introduced him to Albert Einstein.

As he was still 17 when he finished high school, he could avoid military service, and was able to study for three semesters at New York University. He attended a complex analysis class in the role of a student, but ended up taking over as instructor. He met his future wife, Anneli Cahn (married to her first husband at that time) in this class.

Before being able to complete his studies, Lax was drafted into the U.S. Army. After basic training, the Army sent him to Texas A&amp;M University for more studies. He was then sent to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and soon afterwards to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico. At Los Alamos, he began working as a calculator operator, but eventually moved on to higher-level mathematics.

After the war ended, he remained with the Army at Los Alamos for another year, while taking courses at the University of New Mexico, then studied at Stanford University for a semester with Gábor Szegő and George Pólya.

Lax returned to NYU for the 1946–1947 academic year, and by pooling credits from the four universities at which he had studied, he graduated that year. He stayed at NYU for his graduate studies, marrying Anneli in 1948 and earning a PhD in 1949 under the supervision of Kurt O. Friedrichs.

Lax holds a faculty position in the Department of Mathematics, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University.

==Awards and honors==
He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and the National Academy of Sciences, USA, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He won a Lester R. Ford Award in 1966 and again in 1973. In 1974 his shock wave article also won the Chauvenet Prize. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1986, the Wolf Prize in 1987, the Abel Prize in 2005 and the Lomonosov Gold Medal in 2013. The American Mathematical Society selected him as its Gibbs Lecturer for 2007. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

Lax is listed as an ISI highly cited researcher. According to György Marx he was one of The Martians.

Lax also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1990.

==The CDC 6600 incident==

In 1970, as part of an anti-war protest, the Transcendental Students took hostage a CDC 6600 super computer at NYU&#x27;s Courant Institute which Lax had been instrumental in acquiring; the students demanded $100,000 in ransom () to provide bail for a member of the Black Panthers. Some of the students present attempted to destroy the computer with incendiary devices, but Lax and colleagues managed to disable the devices and save the machine.

<text>Electrodeless plasma excitation methods include helicon plasma sources, inductively coupled plasmas, and surface-wave-sustained discharges.

Electrodeless high-frequency discharges (HF) have two important advantages over plasmas using electrodes, like capacitively coupled plasmas that are of great interest for contemporary plasma research and applications:

* Firstly, no sputtering of the electrodes occurs. However, depending on ion energy, sputtering of the reactor walls or the substrate may still occur. Under conditions typical for plasma modification purposes, the ion energy in electrodeless HF discharges is about an order of magnitude lower than in RF discharges. This way, the contamination of the gas phase and damage of the substrate surface can be reduced.
* Secondly, the surface-wave effect allows to generate spatially extended plasmas with electron densities that exceed the critical density.</text><links>

<doc id="486374" wikidata="Q7191864" url="?curid=486374" title="Piercing the Darkness">
<text>Piercing the Darkness, which was published in 1989, is a sequel to Frank E. Peretti&#x27;s novel &quot;This Present Darkness&quot;. It shows contemporary views on angels, demons, prayer and the spiritual realm. &quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot; won the ECPA Gold Medallion Book Award for best fiction in 1990. The book, along with &quot;This Present Darkness&quot;, has been instrumental in promoting belief among Christians in territorial spirits. They have also increased an interest in spiritual warfare. Combined, &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; and &quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot; have sold 3.5 million copies .

== Plot summary==

The novel follows the journey of Sally Beth Roe as she tries to escape her past and slowly overcomes her constant struggle to discern the truth. Also told is the story of another small town, similar to that of &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; and called Bacon&#x27;s Corner, and a resident named Tom Harris. His children are removed from his home by Child Services. Seeming to have no connection with other events at first, a young police officer, Ben Cole, is convinced what is being brushed off as a suicide is actually a murder, and ends up losing his job over the issue, which brings him to the side of an embattled Christian school. Caught in the crossfire is Amber, a girl who has been forced into a curriculum of &quot;meditation techniques&quot; and &quot;inner spiritual guides&quot; that control her moods, attitudes, and actions, and her mother Lucy who realizes this lawsuit and the people who are &quot;helping&quot; her may be much, much more than she bargained for. Before the paths that Sally Roe and Tom Harris (and the others) are on collide, the &quot;Ashton Clarion&quot; editor and his wife, Marshall and Kate Hogan (from &quot;This Present Darkness&quot;), make a return appearance as veteran fighters in this war against the powers of darkness that threaten freedom of religion everywhere. As the story unfolds, the lawsuit and its participants are soon locked in a struggle of ethics versus non-ethics, absolutes versus relativism, right versus wrong, and those with interest in this battle are shown to be even in the highest places of government.
