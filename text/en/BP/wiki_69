<text>Angel sharks are sharks belonging to the genus Squatina. They are the only living members of the family Squatinidae and order Squatiniformes. They commonly inhabit sandy seabeds close to in depth. 

&quot;Squatina&quot; and other Squatiniformes differ from other sharks in having flattened bodies and broad pectoral fins that give them a strong resemblance to rays. They occur worldwide in temperate and tropical seas. Most species inhabit shallow temperate or tropical seas, but a few species inhabit deeper water, down to . Angel sharks are sometimes called monkfish, although this name is also applied to members of the genus &quot;Lophius&quot;.

While some species occur over a wide geographic range, the majority are restricted to a smaller area. Restriction in geographic range might be as a result of the behaviour of &quot;Squatina&quot; species, which are ambush predators with a corresponding stationary bottom-dwelling habit. Thus, trans-ocean migration is extremely unlikely, even though large-scale coastal migratory patterns have been reported in species such as &quot;Squatina squatina&quot;.

Many species are now classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Once common over large areas of the Northeast Atlantic from Norway, Sweden, Morocco and the Canary Islands, to the Mediterranean and Black Seas, fishing pressure has resulted in significant population decline.

==Appearance and biology==
The angel shark has unique features that differentiates them from other sharks. They are considered as smaller sized sharks because they grow up to only and can weigh around , as opposed to the whale shark that can measure up to and weigh .

While the anterior part of the angel shark&#x27;s body is broad and flattened, the posterior part retains a muscular appearance more typical of other sharks. The eyes and spiracles are dorsal and the five gill slits are on its back. Both the pectoral and pelvic fins are large and held horizontally. There are two dorsal fins, no anal fin and unusually for sharks, the lower lobe of the caudal fin is longer than the upper lobe. Most types grow to a length of 1.5 m (5 ft), with the Japanese angel shark, known to reach 2 m. Some angel sharks have deformities that have been described in elasmobranchs. These can include skeletal deformities, as lateral spinal curvature (scoliosis), humpback curvature (khyphosis), axial spinal curvature (lordosis), missing fins, additional fins, deformed snout, and more. These abnormalities have only been found in a few sharks, but the causes of these deformities have been found to be from dietary nutritional imbalance, genetic factors, parasites, traumatic injuries, or stress in the specimen. In 2015, two sharks were captured and examined, and both showed a lateral spinal curvature (scoliosis) and also a humpback curvature. Both the animals had the curvature in the middle of their pectoral fins, but the deformity did not affect their swimming capacity.

Spinal scoliosis has been reported to be diverse in sharks, but mostly in pelagic sharks that depend on their swimming abilities to catch their prey. For the angel shark, specifically &quot;S. squatina&quot;, these curvatures do not seem to significantly affect its hunting capacity, which involves burying itself to ambush their prey. Right now, research is assuming most physical injuries are caused by human interactions because of the constant interference in coastal areas, where most of the sharks reside. There have been few attacks reported, and what few have occurred were due to accidental stepping on of buried newborn sharks. Landings of Pacific angel shark increased through the mid-1980s and reached over 1,125 tonnes in 1986, becoming the shark species with the highest total reported landings off the US West coast that year.

Angel sharks possess extensible jaws that can rapidly snap upwards to capture prey and have long, needle-like teeth. They bury themselves in loose sediment lying in wait for prey, which includes fish, crustaceans and various types of mollusks. They are ovoviviparous, producing litters of up to 13 pups. Pacific angel shark pups are born from March to June in deep water; generally 180 to 300 feet (55 and 90 metres); possibly to protect the pups from predators.

Angel sharks usually reside in depths of and can be seen on muddy or soft benthic substrata where they can easily blend in as they lie in wait. Members of the family Squatinidae have a unique camouflage method, which relates to how they obtain their food, involving lying still on the sea floor, making rapid lunges at passing prey, and using negative pressure to capture prey by sucking it into their mouths.

==Species analysis==
Morphological identification in the field can be difficult due to discontinuity and similarity of species. In this specific circumstance, the sharks&#x27; place within the genus &quot;Squatina&quot; comprises three species in the southern part of the western Atlantic. The three species observed were &quot;Squatina guggenheim&quot;, &quot;S. occulta&quot; and the Brazilian guitarfish &quot;Pseudobatos horkelii&quot;. These three species are listed in the IUCN Red List as threatened, and they are now protected under Brazilian law, which makes angling and exchange illegal. To prevent landing and trade of these endangered species along the São Paulo, DNA barcoding was used. DNA barcoding revealed fishing and trafficking of these protected species. 

==Habitat==
Angel sharks inhabit temperate and tropical marine environments. They are generally found in shallow waters at depths from off coasts. They are known to bury themselves in sandy or muddy environments during the day, where they remain camouflaged for weeks until a desirable prey crosses paths with them. At night, they take a more active approach and cruise on the bottom of the floor. &quot;Squatina&quot; preys on fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods.

==Behaviour==
Although this shark is a bottom-dweller and appears harmless, it can inflict painful lacerations if provoked, due to its powerful jaws and sharp teeth. It may bite if a diver approaches the head or grabs the tail.

Angelsharks have a unique way of breathing compared to most other benthic fish. They do not pump out water from the oropharyngeal cavity like other fish. Instead they use gill flaps located under their body to pump out water during respiration. Doing so also allows them to be more discreet and prevent detection.

==Commercial value==
Prior to the late 1980s, the Pacific angel shark was considered a &quot;munk fish&quot;. It was a byproduct of commercial gillnetting, with no commercial appeal and was used only for crab bait. In 1977, Michael Wagner, a fish processor in Santa Barbara, California, US, in cooperation with local commercial fishermen, developed the market for angel sharks. The annual take of angel shark in 1977 was an estimated 147 kg. By 1985, the annual take of angel shark on the central California coast had increased to more than 454 tonnes or an estimated 90,000 sharks. The population declined dramatically and is now regulated. Angel sharks live very close to shore, resulting in high bycatch rates. In 1991, the use of gillnets in nearshore state waters of California was forbidden, and fishing was restricted in a larger portion of the Pacific angel shark&#x27;s range.

In April 2008, the UK government afforded the angel shark full protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act.

== Conservation ==
Once considered abundant in the Atlantic Ocean, the angel shark (&quot;Squatina squatina&quot;) was classified as &quot;Critically Endangered&quot; in 2010, and recent studies from the IUCN in 2019 reaffirm their CR status. Angel sharks are highly sensitive to bottom trawling and are often caught in gillnets, due to their shallow habitat range.

Angel sharks found in the Mediterranean Sea, &quot;S. aculeata&quot;, &quot;S. oculata&quot;, and &quot;S. squatina&quot;, are at a high risk of extinction, with geographic studies projecting severe population declines for the three species. The Angel Shark Conservation Network, a network established by the IUCN and Shark Trust, is working with authorities from Greece and Turkey to establish conservation strategies to protect angel shark populations in the region.

== Evolution ==
The earliest members of the Squatiniformes are known from the Late Jurassic (from around 160 million years ago) of Europe, assigned to the genus &quot;Pseudorhina.&quot; Preserved full body specimens of &quot;Pseudorhina&quot; are very similar to those of living &quot;Squatina&quot; species. The earliest records that can be assigned with confidence to the modern genus are known from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian) of England.

<text>Squatiniformes is an order of sharks belonging to Squalomorphii. It contains only a single living genus &quot;Squatina&quot;, commonly known as angelsharks. The oldest genus of the order, &quot;Pseudorhina&quot; is known from the Late Jurassic of Europe. Three other genera, &quot;Cretasquatina&quot;, &quot;Cretascyllium&quot; and &quot;Parasquatina&quot; are known from Cretaceous fossils from North America and Europe, though the placement of &quot;Parasquatina&quot; in the order has been questioned. All living and extinct members of the order share a similar body morphology with a highly flattened body with enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins suggestive of a bottom-dwelling ambush predator ecology. Teeth have been assigned to the modern genus from the Late Jurassic onwards, but the actual genus assignment of many of these species is unclear. The earliest records that can be assigned with confidence to the modern genus are known from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian) of England.

<doc id="480225" wikidata="Q289933" url="?curid=480225" title="Hubal">
<text>In Arabian mythology, Hubal () was a god worshipped in pre-Islamic Arabia, notably by the Quraysh at the Kaaba in Mecca. The god&#x27;s icon was a human figure believed to control acts of divination, which was performed by tossing arrows before the statue. The direction in which the arrows pointed answered questions asked to Hubal. The specific powers and identity attributed to Hubal are equally unclear.

Access to the temple of the icon was controlled by the Quraysh tribe. Hubal&#x27;s devotees fought against followers of the Islamic prophet Muhammad during the Battle of Badr in 624 CE, and Battle of Uhud in 625 CE. After Muhammad entered Mecca in 630, he destroyed the statue of Hubal from the Kaaba along with the icons of all the other polytheistic gods.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Hubal&quot; may be ultimately derivative of the name Baal from the Canaanite pantheon. In particular, the name could derive from the Aramaic &quot;hu bel&quot;, meaning &quot;he is Baal&quot;. The relationship between Hubal and Baal is supported by some additional evidence, including that both were depicted with a missing or broken right hand.

Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi&#x27;s &quot;Book of Idols&quot; describes the image as shaped like a human, with the right hand broken off and replaced with a golden hand. According to Ibn Al-Kalbi, the image was made of red agate, whereas Al-Azraqi, an early Islamic commentator, described it as of &quot;cornelian pearl&quot;. Al-Azraqi also relates that it &quot;had a vault for the sacrifice&quot; and that the offering consisted of a hundred camels. Both authors speak of seven arrows, placed before the image, which were cast for divination, in cases of death, virginity, and marriage.

According to Ibn Al-Kalbi, the image was first set up by Khuzayma ibn Mudrika, but another tradition, recorded by Ibn Ishaq, holds that Amr ibn Luhayy, a leader of the Khuza&#x27;a tribe, put an image of Hubal into the Kaaba, where it was worshipped as one of the chief deities of the tribe. The date for Amr is disputed, with dates as late as the end of the fourth century AD suggested, but what is quite sure is that the Quraysh later became the protectors of the ancient holy place, supplanting the Khuza&#x27;a.

A tale recorded by Ibn Al-Kalbi has Muhammad&#x27;s grandfather Abdul Mutallib vowing to sacrifice one of his ten children. He consulted the arrows of Hubal to find out which child he should choose. The arrows pointed to his son Abd-Allah, the future father of Muhammad. However, he was saved when 100 camels were sacrificed in his place. According to Tabari, Abdul Mutallib later also brought the infant Muhammad himself before the image.

After defeat by Muhammad&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Badr, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, leader of the Quraysh army, is said to have called on Hubal for support to gain victory in their next battle, saying &quot;Show your superiority, Hubal&quot;. When Muhammad conquered Mecca in 630, he broke the statue of Hubal, along with the other 360 images at the Kaaba, and dedicated the structure to the Abrahamic God.

==Origins of Hubal==
There may be some foundation of truth in the story that Amr travelled in Syria and had brought back from there the cults of the goddesses ʻUzzāʼ and Manāt, and had combined it with that of Hubal, the idol of the Khuza&#x27;a. According to Al-Azraqi, the image was brought to Mecca &quot;from the land of Hit in Mesopotamia&quot; (Hīt in modern Iraq). Philip K. Hitti, who relates the name &quot;Hubal&quot; to an Aramaic word for spirit, suggests that the worship of Hubal was imported to Mecca from the north of Arabia, possibly from Moab or Mesopotamia. Hubal may have been the combination of Hu, meaning &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;god&quot;, and the Moabite god Baal meaning &quot;master&quot; or &quot;lord&quot; or as a rendition of Syriac &quot;habbǝlā&quot;/Hebrew &quot;heḇel&quot; &quot;vanity&quot;. Outside South Arabia, Hubal&#x27;s name appears just once, in a Nabataean inscription; there Hubal is mentioned along with the gods Dushara (ذو الشراة) and Manawatu—the latter, as Manat, was also popular in Mecca. On the basis of such slender evidence, it has been suggested that Hubal &quot;may actually have been a Nabataean&quot;. There are also inscriptions in which the word Hubal appears to be part of personal names, translatable as &quot;Son of Hubal&quot; or &quot;made by Hubal&quot;.

==Mythological role==
The paucity of evidence concerning Hubal makes it difficult to characterise his role or identity in pagan Arabian mythologies. The 19th century scholar Julius Wellhausen suggested that Hubal was regarded as the son of al-Lāt and the brother of Wadd. Hugo Winckler in the early twentieth century speculated that Hubal was a lunar deity, a view that was repeated by other scholars. This was derived from Ditlef Nielsen&#x27;s theory that South Arabian mythology was based on a trinity of Moon-father, Sun-mother and the evening star (the planet Venus) envisaged as their son. More recent scholars have rejected this view, partly because it is speculation but also because they believe a Nabataean origin would have made the context of South Arabian beliefs irrelevant.

Mircea Eliade and Charles J. Adams assert that he was &quot;a god of rain and a warrior god. Towards the end of the pre-Islamic era he emerged as an intertribal warrior god worshipped by the Quraysh and the allied tribes of the Kinana and Tihama.&quot; The view that he was a warrior rain god is repeated by David Adams Leeming.

John F. Healey in &quot;The Religion of the Nabataeans&quot; (2001) accepts the Nabataean origins of the god, but says there is little evidence of Hubal&#x27;s mythological role, but that it is possible that he was closely linked to Dushara in some way. The one surviving inscription concerns a religious injunction to placate Hubal and others for violating a tomb.

==Modern usage==
===Among Islamists===
Islamists have invoked the figure of Hubal in the ideological struggles of the post-Cold War era. In Islam, Hubal has been used as a symbol of modern forms of &quot;idol worship&quot;. According to Adnan A. Musallam, this can be traced to one of the founders of radical Islamism, Sayyid Qutb, who used the label to attack secular rulers such as Nasser, seen as creating &quot;idols&quot; based on un-Islamic Western and Marxist ideologies. In 2001, Osama bin Laden called America the modern Hubal. He referred to allies of America as &quot;hypocrites&quot; who &quot;all stood behind the head of global unbelief, the Hubal of the modern age, America and its supporters&quot;. Al Qaeda&#x27;s then number two, Ayman al-Zawahiri, repeated the phrase (&quot;hubal al-&#x27;asr&quot;) in describing America during his November 2008 message following Barack Obama&#x27;s election to the presidency. The analogy may have been passed on to Bin Laden by one of his teachers, Abdullah Azzam.

===Among Christian evangelicals===
Christian evangelicals have invoked Hubal by claiming that the worship of Allah as proclaimed by Muhammad was not a restoration of Abrahamic monotheism, but an adaptation of the worship of Hubal. Robert Morey&#x27;s 1994 book &quot;Moon-god in the Archeology of the Middle East&quot; revives Hugo Winckler&#x27;s identification of Hubal as a moon god, and claims that worship of Allah evolved from that of Hubal, thus making Allah a &quot;moon god&quot; too. This view is repeated in the Chick tracts &quot;Allah Had No Son&quot; and &quot;The Little Bride&quot;, and has been widely circulated in evangelical and anti-Islamic literature in the United States. In 1996, Janet Parshall asserted that Muslims worship a moon god in syndicated radio broadcasts. In 2003 Pat Robertson stated, &quot;The struggle is whether Hubal, the Moon God of Mecca, known as Allah, is supreme, or whether the Judeo-Christian Jehovah God of the Bible is Supreme.&quot;

Farzana Hassan sees these claims as an extension of longstanding Christian evangelical beliefs that Islam is &quot;pagan&quot; and that Muhammad was an impostor and deceiver.

<doc id="480228" wikidata="Q291329" url="?curid=480228" title="Kamo no Chōmei">
<text>was a Japanese author, poet (in the waka form), and essayist. He witnessed a series of natural and social disasters, and, having lost his political backing, was passed over for promotion within the Shinto shrine associated with his family. He decided to turn his back on society, took Buddhist vows, and became a hermit, living outside the capital. This was somewhat unusual for the time, when those who turned their backs on the world usually joined monasteries. Along with the poet-priest Saigyō he is representative of the literary recluses of his time, and his celebrated essay &quot;Hōjōki&quot; (&quot;An Account of a Ten-Foot-Square Hut&quot;) is representative of the genre known as &quot;recluse literature&quot; (sōan bungaku).

==Early life==
Born with the name Kamo no Nagaakira, he was the second son of Kamo no Nagatsugu, &quot;sho-negi&quot; or superintendent, of the Lower Kamo (Shimogamo) shrine. He was also known by the title Kikudaifu. The exact year of his birth is unknown, but thought to be either 1153 or 1155, with 1155 being the generally accepted date. From an early age, he studied poetry and music in a comfortable environment. At the time, the Upper and Lower Kamo Shrines owned large amounts of property around the Kamo River, northeast of the &quot;Heian&quot; capital (Kyoto), holding great power and prestige among the aristocracy. The Kamo Festival (Aoi Matsuri), occurring in the middle of the fourth month, was considered the most important Shinto event and is vividly depicted in literature of the time, most notably in Chapter Nine of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. Chōmei was raised under these religious and material conditions.

In 1160, his father was promoted to junior fourth rank, lower grade, which ultimately led the seven-year-old Chōmei to being promoted to fifth rank, junior grade; these were high positions within the Kamo Shrine hierarchy. Ill health and political maneuvering led his father to retire in 1169, however, and in the early 1170s he died. Expecting to fill the vacant role left by his father, Chōmei, then in his late teens, was passed over, and instead his cousin was promoted to this position. In poems in &quot;Kamo no Chōmei-shū&quot;, Chōmei lamented this development.
When Chōmei was in his twenties, he moved to his paternal grandmother&#x27;s house. Disinheritance may have been the reason. Since Chōmei&#x27;s father had been the youngest in the family, he inherited his mother&#x27;s residence. In his thirties, Chōmei states in &quot;Hōjōki&quot; that after losing “backing” in his paternal grandmother&#x27;s house, he was forced out, built a small house near the Kamo River. Chōmei would live here until he became a recluse.

In &quot;Hōjōki&quot;, Chōmei states that he was able to leave the world behind because he was not attached to society by marriage or offspring.

The &quot;Hōjōki&quot; is Chōmei&#x27;s notebook while he lived &quot;in a small hut&quot; in a suburb of the capital Fukuwara. &quot;His work contains, as well as an obviously first-hand description of Fukuwara, a striking account of material conditions in the capital in the years from 1177 to 1182.&quot;

==Life as a poet==
After his father&#x27;s death, Chōmei became more interested in poetry, and three poets were influential to his literary growth. His mentor Shōmyō (1112-1187) was of the Rokujō school, which did not receive much recognition because of a lack of patrons from the Imperial household. As his mentor, Shōmyō taught Chōmei the finer techniques and styles of court poetry. Kamo no Shigeyasu, the head Shinto priest of the Upper Kamo Shrine, was also instrumental in developing Chōmei&#x27;s skill as a poet, inviting him to his poetry contests. Through Shigeyasu&#x27;s influence and support, Chōmei completed a book of poems called &quot;Kamo no Chōmei-shū&quot; (&quot;Collection&quot;) in 1181. Another important figure in the development of Chōmei&#x27;s poetry was the poet priest Shun&#x27;e. Through his poetry circle, known as &quot;Karin&#x27;en&quot; (Grove of Poetry), an amalgam of people, including Shinto and Buddhist Priests, low- to mid-ranking courtiers and women in the court, shared their writings. The tales from these meetings filled a large part of Chōmei&#x27;s &quot;Mumyōshō&quot;.

Music played a significant role throughout Chōmei&#x27;s life. His musical mentor, Nakahara Ariyasu, was instrumental in his development, and Chōmei, known as Kikudaifu by his audience, was noted for his skill. According to an account by Minamoto no Ienaga, Chōmei&#x27;s love for music was revealed in the sorrow he felt when he had to return a biwa (lute) called Tenari to the emperor.

In his thirties, Chōmei enjoyed moderate success in poetry contests and inclusion into anthologies, such as the &quot;Senzaishū&quot;. With inventive phrasing to describe nature, such as &quot;semi no ogawa&quot; to describe the Kamo river, Chōmei caused a bit of controversy. Entering the poem, with this phrase, into the Kamo Shrine&#x27;s official poetry contest, he lost because the judge thought he was writing about a river that did not exist. Chōmei insisted, however, that the phrase had been used before and was included in the records of the shrine. Chōmei seems to have offended his cousin, who had assumed Nagatsugu&#x27;s position of &quot;sho-negi&quot;. This episode shows that Chōmei still held a grudge against his cousin for becoming the new sho-negi. To rub in the embarrassment, the poem with this phrase was later included in the &quot;Shin Kokinshū&quot;.

Chōmei reached a turning point in his mid-forties. His patron, the cloistered emperor Go-Toba, supported his poetry writing. To create an anthology (&quot;Shinkokinshū&quot;) to rival the &quot;Kokinshū&quot;, Go-Toba organized the Imperial Poetry Office, filled with numerous elite courtiers and literati, among whom Chōmei was assigned as a lower level member. As a member of this organization, Chōmei enjoyed benefits that would otherwise not have been given to him, including visits to the Imperial Garden to view the cherry blossoms in bloom. Chōmei worked for the Imperial Poetry Office until he decided to become a recluse in 1204.

==Life as a recluse==
Chōmei&#x27;s specific reasons for becoming a recluse are unclear, but a string of bad luck, specifically the death of his father and his inability to fill the position left behind by him, may have caused him to leave court life. He spent the next five years in Ohara, at the foot of Mount Hiei, but considered his time here as a failure, and so he moved to Hino, in the hills southeast of the capital, where he spent the rest of his life. The design of the hut he built in Hino was inspired by the dwelling of the Buddhist recluse Vimalakirti. The &quot;Vimalakirti Sutra&quot; exerted a profound influence on &quot;Hōjōki&quot;. Chōmei wrote &quot;Mumyōshō&quot;, &quot;Hosshinshū&quot;, and &quot;Hōjōki&quot; while living as a recluse. Though Chōmei states in &quot;Hōjōki&quot; that he never left his dwelling, a separate account states that he made a trip to Kamakura to visit the shōgun and poet Minamoto no Sanetomo.

During his later life, Chōmei maintained a socio-historical perspective that was rare in court poets of the time. The accounts of chaos in the capital in the first part of &quot;Hōjōki&quot; suggest Chōmei&#x27;s social interests, and he contrasts them with his peaceful life as a Buddhist in seclusion. His account coincides with the spread of Buddhism to the general populace; and his careful depictions of the natural surroundings of his hut and of the natural and social disasters in the capital form a unique microscopic and macroscopic view of life during a violent period of transition. Attention to nature and self-reflection characterize the genre of recluse literature, and Chōmei was its pre-eminent practitioner.

Chōmei died on the tenth day of the intercalary six-month of 1216, when he asked Zenjaku to complete a Kōshiki for him.

<text>Peter Boardman (25 December 1950 – 17 May 1982) was an English mountaineer and author. He is best known for a series of bold and lightweight expeditions to the Himalayas, often in partnership with Joe Tasker, and for his contribution to mountain literature. Boardman and Tasker died on the North East Ridge of Mount Everest in 1982. The Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature was established in their memory.

==Early life and education==
Boardman was born in Stockport, Cheshire, England, the youngest son of Alan Howe Boardman (1920–1979) and Dorothy Boardman (1923–2007). He attended Stockport Grammar School from 1956 to 1969, going on school trips to Corsica in 1964 and 1965, and to the Swabian Alps in 1966. Boardman first began climbing with school friends at Windgather Rocks in the Peak District National Park. After joining the Mynydd Climbing Club in 1966, Boardman&#x27;s climbing progressed quickly and he went on to climb in the Pennine Alps in 1968.

From 1969 to 1972, Boardman studied English at the University of Nottingham where he was President of the Mountaineering Club from 1971 to 1972. While at university Boardman climbed extensively in Britain and Europe and embarked on his first expedition, to Afghanistan, in 1972. After Nottingham, Boardman obtained a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (English and outdoor activities) from the University College of North Wales in 1973.

==Personal life==
Boardman married Hilary Collins in August 1980. They first met in 1974 when Hilary attended a course at Glenmore Lodge instructed by Boardman. After the Changabang expedition in 1976 Hilary arranged for Boardman to give a slide show at Belper High School where she was the teacher responsible for outdoor activities. Soon after they began climbing together in Derbyshire and Scotland. Hilary shared Boardman&#x27;s passion for mountains and they climbed together on Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya and Carstensz Pyramid. Hilary left Britain to take up a teaching position in Switzerland where she was later joined by Boardman when he took over as Director of the International School of Mountaineering in Leysin.

==Career==
With his postgraduate qualification, and climbing and mountaineering experience, Boardman was set on the path to becoming a professional mountaineer. In 1973, he became an instructor at Glenmore Lodge, Aviemore. He moved on to become the National Officer at the British Mountaineering Council in 1975. In 1978 Boardman took over as Director of the International School of Mountaineering in Leysin, Switzerland, after Dougal Haston&#x27;s death, a position he held until his own death in 1982.
Other positions and qualifications held by Boardman include:
* Mountain Guide Carnet – September 1977.
* Vice-president, British Mountaineering Council. Elected in 1979.
* President, Association of British Mountain Guides. Elected in 1979.

==Mountaineering==
===Europe===
Boardman climbed extensively in Europe throughout his career. His early climbs included:
* 1970 Petit Dru, SW Pillar
* 1971 First British ascents of the North Face Direct of the Olan, WNW face of Pic Sans Nom and SW face of Aiguille de Sialouze. Boardman also climbed the north face of the Matterhorn, and met Joe Tasker and Dick Renshaw for the first time on the North Spur of the Droites.
* 1973 First British ascents of the North Face of the Nesthorn and the North Face Direct of the Lauterbrunnen Breithorn.

===Hindu Kush, 1972===
Boardman&#x27;s first expedition outside Europe was with fellow members of the Nottingham University Mountaineering Club who drove overland to the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan in the summer of 1972. A training climb on the North Face of Koh-i-Khaaik (5,860m) turned into an epic when the climbers underestimated the difficulty of the Face, taking longer than planned to reach the summit and necessitating a 50-mile walk back to Base Camp. Their main objective, the unclimbed North Face of Koh-i-Mondi (6,234m), was climbed relatively uneventfully. In all, expedition members climbed five new peaks and five new routes.

===Mount Dan Beard, Alaska, 1974===
In May 1974, Boardman and Roger O&#x27;Donovan made the first ascent via the South Face, and the second ascent overall, of Mount Dan Beard (3,127m) in the Alaska Range. An attempt on Denali was abandoned when O&#x27;Donovan became ill.

=== Everest, South West Face, 1975 ===
When Chris Bonington was recruiting for the large, siege-style expedition to climb the South West Face of Everest, Boardman was recommended by Paul Braithwaite as a talented climber who would be compatible with other team members. The expedition was successful in placing the first two Britons, Doug Scott and Dougal Haston, on the summit on 24 September 1975. Boardman and Pertemba, the expedition&#x27;s head Sirdar, reached the summit on 26 September. On their descent, they met Mick Burke a short distance below the summit and still ascending. They waited for him at the South Summit in deteriorating weather, but Burke was never seen alive again.

===Changabang, West Wall, 1976===
Boardman and Joe Tasker, on their first expedition together, made the first ascent of the West Wall of Changabang (6,864m) in the Garhwal Himalaya in India. The climb took 25 days during September and October 1976. It was considered &quot;probably the most outstanding lightweight Himalayan climb so far achieved&quot;. Changabang had been Joe Tasker&#x27;s idea; he had seen it the previous year while on Dunagiri with Dick Renshaw. As Renshaw was recovering from frostbite Tasker had asked Boardman if he was interested in a new route on Changabang. Boardman had agreed readily with Tasker&#x27;s proposal: &quot;This climb would be all that I wanted. Something that would be totally committing, that would bring my self-respect into line with the public recognition I had received for Everest.&quot;

===K2, West Ridge, 1978===
Boardman was invited by Chris Bonington to join an expedition to K2 (8,611m) in 1978. The team was composed of climbers Paul Braithwaite, Nick Estcourt, Doug Scott and Joe Tasker, as well as a doctor, Jim Duff, and cameraman Tony Riley. At the time, K2 had been climbed successfully only twice and the West Ridge not at all. Boardman and Tasker reached a height of approximately 6,700m, but the expedition was abandoned when Estcourt was killed in an avalanche.

===Carstensz Pyramid, 1978===
In December 1978 Boardman and Hilary Collins made the first ascent of the South Face of Carstensz Pyramid (4,884m) in the Indonesian province of Papua on the island of New Guinea. In early January 1979 they climbed the nearby peak Dugundugu and, with two French climbers, traversed the three summits of Ngga Pulu.

===Kangchenjunga, North Ridge, 1979===
On 16 May 1979 Boardman, together with Doug Scott and Joe Tasker, reached the summit of Kangchenjunga (8,586m) via the North Ridge. This was the third ascent overall and the first via this route. Two earlier attempts by the team (which included French mountaineer Georges Bettembourg) were thwarted by storms high on the mountain.

===Gauri Sankar, South Summit, 1979===
Boardman led an Anglo-Nepalese expedition to make the first ascent of the southern summit of Gauri Sankar, a twin-peaked mountain in Nepal. The team composed of Boardman, Pemba Lama, Tim Leach and Guy Neithardt reached the South Summit (7,010m) on 9 November 1979 via the West Ridge. Fellow expedition member John Barry, who had been injured in a fall, waited at a lower camp.

===K2, West Ridge and Abruzzi Spur, 1980===
Immediately after the 1978 K2 expedition, Boardman and Tasker had applied for a permit for another attempt on the mountain. In May 1980 they returned to the West Ridge with Dick Renshaw and Doug Scott. Their route avoided the avalanche-prone slope of 1978, but proved too difficult and the team, now minus Scott, turned their attention to the Abruzzi Spur, the route taken by the first ascensionists. On their second attempt on this route, they reached a height of 8,077m but their tent was overwhelmed by an avalanche in the middle of the night leading to a lengthy and precarious retreat off the mountain. A third and final attempt was abandoned due to storms on the mountain.

===Kongur, 1981===
Boardman was part of the British team that made the first ascent of Kongur (7,719m), in China. The climbing team, consisting of Boardman, Chris Bonington, Al Rouse and Joe Tasker, was supplemented by cameraman, Jim Curran, and a medical team carrying out research on the effects of altitude on expedition members. The ascent was made alpine style via the southwest rib with the summit reached on the evening of 12 July 1981.

===Everest, North East Ridge, 1982===
British mountaineers had last visited the north side of Everest in the 1930s. Permission for the 1982 expedition was obtained after the Chinese government began opening up mountains to foreign expeditions. The North East Ridge was &quot;an obvious choice [...] elegant, unknown and looked, from the few photographs we had, difficult but possible.&quot; The North East Ridge rises two miles from the Raphu La (6,510m) to the North East Shoulder (8,393m) and the junction with the North Ridge. From there the summit is almost another mile away. The crux of the North East Ridge is a series of pinnacles high on the ridge before the junction with the North Ridge.

The expedition consisted of Boardman, Chris Bonington, Dick Renshaw and Joe Tasker, supported by expedition doctor Charles Clarke and Adrian Gordon, and Chinese Base Camp staff. Tasker had responsibility for filming the expedition documentary. The expedition arrived at Base Camp on 16 March 1982 and began acclimatisation forays and establishment of camps further up the Rongbuk glacier. By April the team had begun climbing on the Ridge, establishing snow caves at 6,850m and 7,256m. In early May their third and highest snow cave was established at 7,850m. While climbing on the First Pinnacle above 8,000m Renshaw experienced a minor stroke. After suffering a second stroke at Base Camp, and following medical advice, Renshaw left to return home accompanied by Clarke as far as Chengdu. By this time Bonington realised that he would be unable to go much higher on the mountain without the use of supplementary oxygen and switched to a support role. He intended to climb to the North Col with Gordon and wait there while Boardman and Tasker made a final push to cross the Three Pinnacles. Boardman and Tasker left Advance Base Camp on 15 May and reached the second snow cave the same day. By 16 May they reached the third snow cave and made what was to be their last radio contact with Bonington that evening. On 17 May they moved slowly beyond the First Pinnacle and were last seen at 9:00pm at the foot of the Second Pinnacle at 8,250m having been climbing for 14 hours. By 21 May, with no sign of Boardman and Tasker for four days, Bonington and Clarke travelled up the Kangshung Valley to search the other side of the ridge for any sign of the missing climbers, while Gordon maintained a watch at Advance Base Camp. By the beginning of June the expedition was back at Base Camp and Bonington travelled to Chengdu to break the news of the deaths to Boardman and Tasker&#x27;s families.

==Death==
News of Boardman&#x27;s death was relayed to Hilary Boardman in Leysin, and Dorothy Boardman in Manchester, and covered in the media. A memorial service was held for Boardman at St George&#x27;s Church in Stockport on 11 July 1982. In September 1982 Hilary Boardman and Maria Coffey, Joe Tasker&#x27;s girlfriend, travelled to the north side of Everest as far as Advance Base Camp to retrace the last journey made by Boardman and Tasker.

===Discovery of body===
Expeditions to the North East Ridge in 1985, 1986 and 1987 failed to reach Boardman and Tasker&#x27;s high point. In August 1988, Russell Brice and Harry Taylor succeeded in crossing the Pinnacles, thus completing the unclimbed section of the route, before descending via the North Ridge. They saw no sign of Boardman or Tasker due to heavy monsoon snow cover.

The next expedition on the ridge was in 1992 when a joint Japanese-Kazakh expedition crossed the Pinnacles but were unable to continue to the summit. They found a body beyond the second pinnacle at approximately 8,200m on the Rongbuk side of the ridge. Photographs taken by Vladimir Suviga and sent to Chris Bonington enabled the body to be identified, from the clothing and features, as Peter Boardman.

In 1995 the complete ridge was climbed by a Japanese expedition. They also came across a body which was initially thought to be Joe Tasker. Upon re-examining all the evidence, Chris Bonington concluded that both sightings were of Boardman: &quot;At first it was surmised that this was Joe Tasker, but after carefully comparing the written descriptions and the photographs provided by each expedition, I became convinced that this was the same as the original sighting and therefore that of Pete.&quot;

==Writing==
Boardman&#x27;s book about the 1976 Changabang expedition, &quot;The Shining Mountain&quot;, is one of the outstanding works of mountaineering literature, and won the 1979 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize for literature. A second book, &quot;Sacred Summits&quot;, detailing his climbing exploits in 1979 on Carstensz Pyramid, Kangchenjunga and Gauri Sankar, was published posthumously.

In 1995, these books, along with those of Joe Tasker, were republished in the &quot;Boardman Tasker Omnibus&quot;.

==Commemoration==
* The Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature was set up in 1983 by family and friends of the two climbers to honour their literary legacy.
* The Peter Boardman Climbing Wall at Stockport Grammar School was dedicated in 2008.
* In 2012, a calendar was produced for 2013 to mark the 30th anniversary of the disappearance of Boardman and Tasker.

<text>David Jones Pty Ltd, trading as David Jones (colloquially DJs), is an Australian luxury department store. The brand was owned from 2014 to 2023 by the South African retail group Woolworths South Africa. In December 2022, David Jones was sold to private equity firm Anchorage Capital Partners for approximately $100m.

David Jones was founded in 1838 by David Jones, a Welsh merchant and future politician, after he emigrated to Australia, and is the oldest continuously operating department store in the world still trading under its original name.

In 1980, the Adelaide Steamship Company acquired a substantial interest in David Jones, culminating in a complete takeover. The recession of the early 1990s caused the department store assets to be floated as &quot;David Jones Limited&quot;. For the next two decades, the company went through turbulent times, eventually leading to discussions of a merger with Myer, and then, in 2014, a takeover by South African retail group Woolworths Holdings Limited. In 2016, Woolworths sold the iconic 1938 Market Street store and announced the relocation of DJ&#x27;s head office to Richmond, Victoria.

It has been a member of the International Association of Department Stores from 1979 to 2004.

David Jones Limited currently has 39 stores located throughout most of the Australian states and territories (except Tasmania and the Northern Territory). David Jones&#x27; main competitor is the larger, upmarket department store chain Myer. On 28 July 2016, David Jones opened its first New Zealand store in Wellington after buying Kirkcaldie &amp; Stains, and on 21 November 2019, opened its first Auckland store in the newly developed Westfield Newmarket.

==History==
David Jones, a Welsh merchant, met a Hobart businessman, Charles Appleton, in London. Appleton had established a store in Sydney in 1825 and Jones subsequently established a partnership with him, moved to Australia in 1835, and the Sydney store became known as Appleton and Jones. When the partnership was dissolved in 1838, Jones moved his business to premises on the corner of George Street and Barrack Lane. Jones survived the depression of the 1840s, and by 1856 had retired from active management of the business. A few years later when the firm failed, he returned to manage its affairs and within a few years had fully discharged all obligations to his creditors.

By 1887, the George Street store had been rebuilt and a mail-order facility was introduced. A factory was opened in Marlborough Street, Sydney, to reduce reliance on imported goods. On the death of the founder, his son, Edward Lloyd Jones (1844–1894), led the company. At 18, Edward Lloyd Jones, Jr. (1874–1934) journeyed to England and entered the London office of David Jones. On his return to Australia, he gained pastoral and cattle experience in the Burnett district of Queensland. He re-entered the family business upon the death of his father in the train disaster at Redfern in 1894. David Jones was then a private company, but in 1906, it became a public company. Edward Lloyd Jones, Jr. became chairman of directors and held that position until he resigned in 1921. The Elizabeth Street store was opened in 1927 under the guidance of chairman Charles Lloyd Jones. A further store was opened in Market Street, Sydney, in 1938. A small branch was located in the Australia Hotel on Martin Place. In 1954, a state banquet was held for visiting Queen Elizabeth II in the restaurant of the Elizabeth Street store.

=== 1940–1980 ===
====Regional NSW and interstate entry====
Within New South Wales, David Jones established its first store in Newcastle by acquiring Scott&#x27;s on Hunter Street in 1957 (closed 2011), and in Wollongong, the retailer Walter Lance and Co. in 1960. David Jones acquired and then converted the Big W Department Stores at Kotara Fair and the two-storey Big W at Warrawong in 1971. The Warrawong store closed in February 1986. A store in Wagga Wagga was added due to the purchase of David Copland and Co in 1953 (closed 1971).

David Jones&#x27; expanded into Victoria in the 1960s and in 1982 acquired the three stores of Buckley &amp; Nunn located in Bourke Street, Northland, and Chadstone (closed the latter in 1983). In 1987, David Jones purchased the former GJ Coles store and building at 299 Bourke Street, Melbourne, converting it into a David Jones store. David Jones also owned the former Georges store in Collins Street, Melbourne between 1981 and 1995. In South Australia there were the acquisitions of Charles Birks &amp; Co (Adelaide) in 1954 and John Martin&#x27;s (Adelaide) in 1985. In Western Australia, it acquired Bon Marche (Perth) in 1954 (closed 1979), Foy &amp; Gibson in 1964 (closed 1978), and Aherns (Perth) in 1999. In Queensland, David Jones purchased Finney Isles (Brisbane) in 1955, McKimmons (Townsville) in 1960 (relocated from Flinders Street and then closed in 1994), T.C. Beirne (Brisbane) in 1961, Marsh and Webster (Mackay) in 1963 (closed 1981), Boland&#x27;s (Cairns) also in 1963 (relocated to Earlville in 1984, since closed), Wyper Bros. (Bundaberg) in 1972 (closed 1981), and Stuparts (Maryborough) in 1977 (closed 1981).

====United States====
In 1974, David Jones acquired a group of 12 stores in the United States, called Buffum&#x27;s. These were ultimately rolled into Adelaide Steamship Company and closed by that company in May 1991.

====David Jones Art Gallery====
A significant feature of the Elizabeth Street shop, contributing greatly to its aura of quality and exclusivity, was the David Jones Art Gallery founded in 1944. Directors included Will Ashton (1944–47), Marion Hall Best (1947–49), John Amory (1949–50), M P Ferrandiere (1950–53), George Duncan (1953–63), Robert Haines (1963–76), Brian Moore (1976–84), and Peta Phillips (1984–92). Among the many drawcards were the Dobell exhibition of 1944, the Duke of Bedford&#x27;s collection in 1962, and the Mendel Collection of Modern Painting, also in 1962. Prominent arts societies that held annual exhibitions there included the Australian Art Society, the Society of Artists, Australian Watercolour Institute, Contemporary Art Society, and Society of Sculptors and Associates. Prize exhibitions held in the Gallery included those sponsored by WD &amp; HO Wills and Transfield. The gallery also imported Thai and Cambodian works in the 1960s and 70s. 

====Dajonians Repertory Society====
Throughout the 1930s and &#x27;40s, the Sydney store supported the Dajonians Repertory Society, a Staff Club amateur theatre group. Their plays were variously performed in the David Jones theatrette and such theatres as St James&#x27; Hall and Independent Theatre. They engaged the services of a permanent producer (Carl Francis throughout the &#x27;30s and Frederick Hughes from 1940) and produced six plays a year, mostly light comedies by recognised playwrights such as J. B. Priestley. Through this time the company was led by Sir Charles Lloyd Jones until his death in 1958. By 1959, the store network had expanded to eight stores, with expansion focused upon the burgeoning new suburbs of Sydney.

=== 1980–2000 ===
In 1980, the Adelaide Steamship Company, headed by John Spalvins, acquired a substantial interest in David Jones, culminating in a complete takeover that took the company out of the Jones&#x27; family hands for the first time in its history. Through the 1980s and into the 1990s, the two companies involved themselves in a complex company structure whereby they each owned about half of each other, and financed by huge borrowings, acquired a portfolio of other companies. Other acquisitions made by Adelaide Steamship included Petersville Sleigh, Tooth &amp; Co, Penfolds, and numerous others.

The recession of the early 1990s caused the nervous lenders (over 200 banks) to demand the return of their assets. This forced the liquidation of the portfolio at &quot;fire-sale&quot; prices and led the two companies into bankruptcy; the worthless Adelaide Steamship Company was renamed &quot;Residual Assco Ltd&quot; and was delisted. The worthless David Jones Limited was renamed &quot;DJL&quot;. A number of the assets with value were very successfully sold off via public floats, in particular, National Foods, Woolworths, and the department store assets of DJL were floated as &quot;David Jones Limited&quot;. In 1995, David Jones announced an $800 million public float of the David Jones and John Martin retail operations. The &quot;new&quot; David Jones Limited was subsequently listed on the Australian Securities Exchange with a new ASX code of DJS. The separation and public float of the department store assets in 1995 resulted in structural and cultural changes, which had periods of stagnancy and high staff turnover. Changes in management had DJs falter in the late 1990s. Shares initially offered at A$2 fell as low as A$0.90.

=== 2000–2020 ===
In 2000, David Jones returned to Western Australia after a near 25-year absence in the state. All five stores of the former department store Aherns were converted into David Jones stores in Karrinyup, Booragoon, Claremont, Rockingham and the Perth CBD. The Perth CBD Store was the only store of the five that was renovated. Over time, David Jones opened two more stores in Western Australia in Mandurah and Cannington, as well as two more stores in Hillarys and Innaloo on hold as of 2021 which would make them the largest department store chain in Western Australia.

In 2003, after a 20 million dollar loss, a strategic review in the company led to the closure of David Jones Rockingham, and the exit of the lease of David Jones Fountain Gate, as well as the closure of the loss-making David Jones Online web-based business and its gourmet food retail stores, Foodchain. It revitalised many of its stores, including its flagship Elizabeth Street and Market Street stores in Sydney (two individual buildings, linked both underground and via air bridge through Westfield Sydney). During this period, sales growth and profit growth were not increasing despite a consumer spending boom and the securing of exclusive deals with Australian and international brands. In this period, the share price was volatile; it reached a high over $4.50. The global downturn in 2009 affected David Jones, reporting a sales decline of 6.4% to $1,061.2m in the first half of 2009.

In June 2010, CEO Mark McInnes resigned after allegations that he had sexually harassed a female employee. McInnes&#x27; successor, Paul Zahra, led the company through significant restructuring, including the expansion of the online retail presence until October 2013, when he announced his intention to resign. Zahra retained his position, however, on account of strong shareholder support against Board Chairman Peter Mason, who eventually resigned along with two other directors who had been accused of insider trading.

In October 2013, Myer approached David Jones with a conditional, nonbinding, indicative proposal for a potential merger of the two companies. Myer believed the combined group would have generated &quot;pro forma &quot;sales and earnings before interest and taxes in 2013 around $5.0 billion and $364 million, respectively. In addition, Myer expected that a merger could have achieved more than $85 million of ongoing annual cost synergies within three years, primarily driven by structural efficiencies. The board of David Jones rejected the offer in November 2013. 
In February 2014, Myer again approached David Jones offering to buy the company at market value, with David Jones having a market capitalisation of $1.7 billion. Myer also indicated that its reappointed chief executive Bernie Brookes would be capable of managing the combined entity should the merger occur. David Jones acknowledged the letter stating it would consider any proposal that is in the best interest of its shareholders but made no further comment.

In April 2014, Myer withdrew its proposed merger of equals following on from David Jones&#x27; announcement that it had recommended a $4.00 cash per share proposal and entered into a scheme implementation deed with South African retail group Woolworths, implying a market capitalisation of $2.15 billion. The takeover bid was approved in July 2014 by the Federal Court of Australia. In mid-August 2014, despite the previously stated intention by Woolworths to retain CEO Paul Zahra, Zahra announced his resignation once more amid indications of significant differences between strategy and the future of the company, giving three months&#x27; notice to ensure a smooth handover. Woolworths then announced that Country Road CEO Iain Nairn would succeed Zahra as chief executive.

In July 2015, the Wellington, New Zealand, department store Kirkcaldie &amp; Stains agreed to be purchased by Woolworths South Africa. The existing Wellington store closed in 2016. It reopened on 28 July 2016 as the first David Jones&#x27; store in New Zealand. The David Jones website does not provide delivery to New Zealand, remaining a solely Australian trading website.

Woolworths South Africa sold the 1938 Market Street store in 2016, with the plan that DJ&#x27;s would lease and occupy the site until late 2019. The plan was that this would result in the closure of the store, with the nine floors of homewares, furniture, electricals, and menswear being merged into the 1927 flagship Elizabeth Street store, which was to be renovated and have its floors devoted to shopping space expanded from eight to 12.

=== 2020–present ===
In March 2023, David Jones was purchased from Woolworths Holdings Limited by Australian private equity firm Anchorage Capital Partners for a fraction of the value of the 2014 transaction. The new private equity owner has previously invested in Australian retail brands such as Burger King, Dick Smith, and Golden Circle.

In August 2023, David Jones launched a retail media department called ‘Amplify’. It aims to provide a revenue source by advertising brands such a Jaguar Land Rover, Destination Canada, and Regent Cruises to its customer base.

In 2023, the company embarked on a transformative store optimisation and refurbishment initiative, committing significant investment to reimagine its store portfolio. This journey began with a $15 million overhaul of the flagship Bourke Street Mall store, alongside complete refurbishments of key locations, including Burwood, Bondi Junction, Chatswood Chase, and Southland all due to be completed by late 2025. 

The company permanently closed its Eastland store in January 2024 as a part of a company restructure that would see flagship stores prioritised.

==Branding==
David Jones&#x27; branding—a black-on-white houndstooth pattern—is one of the most recognised corporate identities in Australia. A government-sponsored panel judged it in 2006 as one of Australia&#x27;s top-10 favourite trademarks. The iconic design was the result of a 1967 rebranding exercise by Charles Lloyd Jones, Jr., who desired that the store would be so well known by the design as to not require the use of the name on the packing. It was inspired allegedly from the houndstooth design on a Miss Dior perfume bottle of his mother&#x27;s, Hannah Jones. 
On 25 July 2016, David Jones&#x27; introduced a new logo, with a revised font style and removed references to the houndstooth online.

Slogans have been used for some time at David Jones&#x27;. Often, the slogans have been used for multiple decades and have become the definition of the David Jones&#x27; offer for a generation. Past slogans include &quot;For Service&quot; (1960s), &quot;There&#x27;s no other store like David Jones&quot; (1980s and 1990s), &quot;The most beautiful store in the world&quot; (1980s), &quot;Was. Is. Always&quot; (2010s), &quot;&#x27;Live an extraordinary life&quot; (2014–2016), and &quot;One name: endless possibilities&quot; (2016–present).

David Jones has for some decades used models and &quot;personalities&quot; as a way of creating cut through in advertising. In the late 20th century, it was Maureen Duval, who also hosted &quot;Good Morning Sydney&quot; part sponsored by David Jones on TEN-10 Sydney. In the current century, the new models used include Megan Gale, Miranda Kerr, and Jessica Gomes. Kerr worked for the retailer from 2008 until 2013. On 23 March 2013, model Jessica Gomes was announced as Kerr&#x27;s replacement. Celebrities used by David Jones in recent times include Liz Hurley and Kim Cattrall.

Five stores have food halls, which are viewed as a key part of the David Jones brand, emphasising quality and style, yet have come under recent criticism. The failed Foodchain experiment—effectively a smaller chain of standalone food halls—was sold to the parent company of Freedom Furniture in 2003 after it proved unprofitable. It was announced in July 2016, Neil Perry, a foodservice and restaurant operator, will consult to David Jones&#x27; on the new Food Halls, including assortment, presentation, and service.

==Stores==

David Jones has department stores in all Australian capital cities except Hobart and Darwin. It also has stores in Kotara, Tuggerah, Maitland, Wollongong, Maroochydore, Robina and Broadbeach Waters.

Stores are located in city centre retail areas and enclosed shopping centres. In 2007, David Jones recast its criteria for store locations, reflecting CEO Mark McInnes&#x27; intention to concentrate on &quot;low-risk, high-value locations&quot;. Stores in Sydney at Bankstown Central (closed July 2007) and Westfield Eastgardens (October 2007) were replaced by Myer, but David Jones replaced the Myer store in Westfield Burwood in May 2007 and opened a new store at Westfield Chermside in August 2007 and a new store at QueensPlaza, Brisbane in February 2008. The Melbourne Bourke Street stores were completely renovated in mid-2010 at a cost of $250 million.

In January 2008, David Jones announced that the Claremont store would be closed in 2009 to allow for a complete rebuilding to reopen in 2011. The new store increased floor space by 60%. David Jones&#x27; opened a new format, fashion focused format in Malvern, Victoria on 12 September 2013. On 1 May 2014, David Jones opened in Indooroopilly Shopping Centre, Brisbane. In October 2014, David Jones opened in Macquarie Centre, at the same time a number of foreign retailers opened in the centre including H&amp;M, Zara, and Uniqlo.

In March 2016, the new owners of David Jones&#x27;, Woolworths South Africa, announced the sale of the nine-floor Market Street Sydney store, housing the Home, Food, and Menswear departments, which is to be incorporated into a renovated Elizabeth Street store, which will have its shopping floors increased from eight to 12. The Market Street store was opened in 1938. The store closed on 16 March 2020.

In February 2017, David Jones announced a three-store deal at Westfield Shopping centres in Western Australia. The three stores are in Westfield Carousel, Westfield Innaloo and Westfield Whitford City. The first store opened in Westfield Carousel in August 2018. As of May 2020, the other two stores have either been put on hold, or silently cancelled. On 22 March 2018, two new stores opened, one in Stockland Green Hills in East Maitland, NSW, and another in Mandurah, WA, in the Mandurah Forum Shopping Centre.

In July 2020, David Jones announced the sale of the iconic Melbourne Menswear, Home and Food building at 299 Bourke Street. All departments relocated into the refurbished main building at 310 Bourke Street in July 2022. The Food Hall closed permanently during April 2021 in the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. A tailored selection of food has been retained and incorporated into the renovated main building on level 5. In late 2022, David Jones announced the closure of its Westfield Mt Gravatt store in 2023 after 52 years of trading.

In 2021, it was announced that David Jones in Wellington, the first in New Zealand, would close on 12 June 2022. This leaves David Jones at Westfield Newmarket in Auckland the only store in New Zealand.

As of March 2024, David Jones has 41 stores in Australia and New Zealand:

* ACT: 2 stores
* New South Wales: 15 stores
* Queensland: 7 stores
* South Australia: 3 stores
* Victoria: 6 stores
* Western Australia: 6 stores
* New Zealand: 1 store.

<doc id="480243" wikidata="Q747354" url="?curid=480243" title="Aster (missile family)">
<text>The Aster 15 and Aster 30 are a Franco-Italian family of all-weather, vertical launch surface-to-air missiles. The name &quot;Aster&quot;&quot; stands for &quot;Aérospatiale Terminale&quot;, with French company Aérospatiale having been the project&#x27;s lead contractor before its missile activities were merged into MBDA. It also takes inspiration from the word &quot;aster&quot; (), meaning &quot;star&quot; in Ancient Greek. The missiles as well as the related weapon systems are manufactured by Eurosam, a consortium consisting of MBDA France, MBDA Italy and Thales, each holding a 33.3% share.

The Aster missiles were developed to intercept and destroy the full spectrum of air threats from high-performance combat aircraft, UAVs and helicopters to cruise, anti-radiation and even sea-skimming supersonic anti-ship missiles. The Aster 30 Block 1 and Block 1 NT are designed to also counter ballistic missiles.

The Aster is primarily operated by France and Italy, as well as the United Kingdom as an export customer, and is an integrated component of the PAAMS air defence system, known in the Royal Navy as Sea Viper. As the principal weapon of the PAAMS, the Aster equips the s in French and Italian service as well as the British Type 45 destroyers. It equips the French and Italian FREMM multipurpose frigates, though not through the PAAMS air defense suite itself but specific French and Italian derivatives of the system.

==History==
During the 1980s, the predominant missiles in Franco-Italian service were short-range systems such as the French Crotale, Italian Selenia Aspide or American Sea Sparrow, with ranges up to a dozen kilometres. Some vessels were also equipped with the American medium/long range RIM-66 Standard. France and Italy decided to start development of a domestic medium/long range surface-to-air missile to enter service in the first decade of the 21st century, that would give them comparable range but superior interception capability to the American Standard or British Sea Dart already in service. 

Thought was given in particular to the new missile&#x27;s ability to intercept next-generation supersonic anti-ship missiles, such as the BrahMos missile developed jointly by India and Russia. This allowed the actual systems to have the characteristic of being specialised either in short-to-medium range &quot;point defence&quot; for e.g. ships, or in medium-to-long range &quot;zone defence&quot; of fleets.

In May 1989, a memorandum of understanding was signed between France and Italy for the development of a family of future surface-to air-missiles. Eurosam was formed shortly afterwards. By July 1995 development had taken shape in the form of the Aster missile, and test firing of the first Aster 30 took place. The missile successfully intercepted a target at an altitude of and at speeds of . A Phase 2 contract was awarded in 1997 at US$1 billion for pre-production and development of the French-Italian land and naval systems.

During development trials between 1993 and 1994 all flight sequences, altitudes and ranges, were validated. This was also the period during which the launch sequence of Aster 30 was validated. In May 1996, trials of the Aster 15 active electromagnetic final guidance system against live targets began. All six attempts were successful. During 1997 Aster was extensively tested, this time being pitted against targets such as the Aerospatiale C.22 target and first generation Exocet anti-ship missiles. 

In numerous engagements Aster scored direct impacts on its targets. During an engagement in November 1997 in a strong countermeasures environment, the Aster was not armed with its military warhead, so that the distance between the Aster and the target could be recorded. The target, a C22, was recovered bearing two strong cuts made by the fins of the Aster missile.

In May 2001, Aster again completed the &quot;manufacturer&#x27;s validation firing test&quot;. It was deployed for the first time on the French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier . In June 2001, the Aster achieved a successful interception of an Arabel missile at low altitude in less than five seconds. In 2001, a target simulating an aircraft flying at speeds of Mach 1 and at an altitude of was intercepted by an Aster 15. The first ever operational firing of the Aster missile took place during October 2002 on board &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;.

In November 2003, Eurosam was awarded the 3 billion euro Phase 3 production contract. Full production and exports to France, Italy, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom started. The resulting Aster surface-to-air missile meets inter-service and international requirements, addressing the needs of the land, air and naval forces of France, Italy and the United Kingdom. The decision to base the missile around a common terminal intercept &quot;dart&quot; to which different sized boosters can be attached, has made it modular and extensible.

From 2002 to 2005, the Italian experimental frigate provided a test bed for live firing trials of the Aster 15 from Sylver A43 launchers with EMPAR and SAAM-it systems, and the trials of Aster 30 from Sylver A50 launchers with EMPAR and PAAMS(E) systems. , France had spent €4.1bn at 2010 prices on 10 SAMP/T launchers, 375 Aster 30 missiles and 200 Aster 15 missiles. Another 80 Aster 30 and 40 Aster 15 were purchased for France&#x27;s s under a separate programme.

In January 2023, the Italian and French Minister of Defense signed with MBDA a $2 billion contract for the purchase of 700 Aster missiles.

==Characteristics==
There are two versions of the Aster missile family, the short-medium range version, the Aster 15, and the long range version, the Aster 30. The missile bodies are identical. Their difference in range and intercept speed is because Aster 30 uses a much larger booster. Total weights of the Aster 15 and Aster 30 are and respectively.

The Aster 15 is long, rising to just under for the Aster 30. Aster 15 has a diameter of . Given the larger dimensions of the Aster 30, a naval based system requires the longer tubes of the Sylver A50 or A70 vertical launching system (VLS). The American Mark 41 Vertical Launching System can accommodate Aster 30.

===Variants===
* Aster 15: Short to medium range surface-to-air missile
* Aster 15 EC : New version of the Aster 15 with twice the range (60+ km); under development as of 2023 and expected to be introduced in 2030
* Aster 30 Block 0: Medium to long range surface-to-air missile. It can pull manoeuvres in excess of 50&quot;g&quot;.
* Aster 30 Block 1: Variant with anti-ballistic missile capability; tailored to counter -class short-range ballistic missiles.
* Aster 30 Block 1NT: NT standing for &quot;New Technology&quot;, it is a new variant of the Aster 30 designed to counter short and -class medium-range ballistic missiles.
* Aster 30 Block 2 BMD – Anti-ballistic missile under development and intended to counter up to -class ballistic and maneuvering missiles.

The Aster 30 Block 1 is used on the Eurosam SAMP/T system operated by the French Air and Space Force and the Italian Army. In 2015, France launched the development of the Block 1NT variant, a programme Italy would join in 2016. The same year, the United Kingdom showed interest in acquiring the Block 1NT version for its Type 45 destroyers currently operating the Block 0. In 2022, the United Kingdom announced a series of upgrades to its Type 45 destroyers. This included the implementation of the Block 1 version for anti-ship ballistic missile defense.

==Deployment==
===Naval systems===
* 
* Type 45 destroyer
* FREMM multipurpose frigate
* &quot;Al Riyadh&quot;-class frigate
* &quot;Kalaat Béni Abbès&quot; class
* Frégate de défense et d&#x27;intervention
* Thaon di Revel-class offshore patrol vessel
* Doha-class corvette

===Land systems===

The Aster 30 has been incorporated by Eurosam into a mobile SAM system, fulfilling the ground-based theatre air defence/protection requirement. It comes in the form of the Sol-Air Moyenne-Portée/Terrestre (French for &quot;Surface-to-Air Medium-Range/Land-based&quot;), abbreviated as SAMP/T. The system uses a network of radars and sensors – including 3D phased array radar – enabling it to be effective against various air threats such as aircraft, tactical ballistic missiles, standoff missiles, cruise missiles or anti-radiation missiles.

The SAMP/T uses an upgraded version of the Arabel long range radar, developed under the Aster 30 Block 1 upgrade program, in order to extend the system&#x27;s capability against higher speed and higher altitude targets. The Aster 30 Block 1 can intercept missiles with a range (short-range ballistic missiles).&lt;ref name=&quot;SAMP/T&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing==
*In April 2008, RSS &quot;Intrepid&quot;, a of the Republic of Singapore Navy, shot down an aerial drone off the French port of Toulon during a naval exercise. Then again in 2010, a frigate of the same class, RSS &quot;Supreme&quot; fired an Aster 15 and shot down an aerial drone off the coast of Hawaii as part of exercise RIMPAC 2010. The RSN conducted 6 successful live-firings of the Aster missile over 11 years.
*Beginning with in September 2010, all of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 45 destroyers have successfully intercepted Mirach drones with Aster missiles at the Benbecula ranges off the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. Mirach is a jet which flies at speeds of up to at altitudes as low as or as high as .
*In December 2011, an Aster 30 missile downed an Israeli &quot;Black Sparrow&quot; ballistic missile target, the first time an Aster missile had attempted such an engagement.
*In April 2012, the , , of the French Navy downed an American GQM-163 Coyote target simulating a sea-skimming supersonic anti-ship cruise missile traveling at Mach 2.5 (3000 km/h) with an altitude of less than 5 metres. It was the first time a European missile defence system destroyed a supersonic sea-skimming missile. The trial was described as a complex operational scenario.
*In 2021, during the Exercise At-Sea Demo: Formidable Shield 2021, the Horizon-class frigate &quot;Forbin&quot;, intercepted a supersonic (&gt;3000 km/h) sea skimming target using an Aster 30 missile.
*In 2024, during the EU operation in the Red Sea, it is likely that the French Navy utilised Aster 30 to intercept three Houthi ballistic missiles. The missile was also likely used by the Royal Navy to down another Houthi ballistic missile in April 2024.

<doc id="480247" wikidata="Q1267056" url="?curid=480247" title="Through-composed music">
<text>In the theory of musical form, through-composed music is a continuous, non-sectional, and non-repetitive piece of music. The term is typically used to describe songs, but can also apply to instrumental music.

While most musical forms such as ternary form (ABA), rondo form (ABACABA), and sonata form (ABA&#x27;) rely on repetition, through-composed music does not re-use material (ABCD). This constant introduction of new material is most noticeable in musical settings of poems, in contrast to the often used strophic form (AAA). Through-composed songs have different music for each stanza of the lyrics. The German word &quot;durchkomponiert&quot; is also used to indicate this concept.

==Examples==
Musicologist James Webster defines through-composed music in the following manner:
Many examples of this form can be found in Schubert&#x27;s lieder, in which the words of a poem are set to music, and each line is different. In his lied &quot;Erlkönig&quot;, in which the setting proceeds to a different musical arrangement for each new stanza and whenever the piece comes to each character, the character portrays its own voice register and tonality. Another example within instrumental music is Haydn&#x27;s &#x27;Farewell Symphony&#x27;.

==Opera and musicals==
The term &quot;through-composed&quot; is also applied to opera and musical theater to indicate a work that consists of an uninterrupted stream of music from beginning to end, as in the operas of Wagner. This stands in contrast to the practice, as for example occurs in Mozart&#x27;s Italian- and German-language operas, of having a collection of songs interrupted by recitative or spoken dialogue. Examples of the modern trend towards through-composed works in musical theater include the works of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Claude-Michel Schönberg. In musical theater, works with clear delineations between songs yet no spoken dialogue – such as &quot;Les Misérables&quot; or &quot;Hamilton&quot; – are usually instead referred to by the term &quot;through-sung&quot;.

==In popular music==
While through-composed form is very uncommon in popular music, several notable examples do exist:

*&quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot; by Radiohead shifts through four main sections, none of which repeat. Starting with the first part (in ), each section gets progressively louder until the climax of the song&#x27;s final portion.
*Many Genesis songs, including &quot;The Musical Box&quot; and &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;, are through-composed.
*Trey Anastasio, guitarist and vocalist of the band Phish, has written many compositions that utilize through-composed structure. Examples include &quot;You Enjoy Myself&quot; (the band&#x27;s signature song), &quot;Guyute&quot;, &quot;Divided Sky&quot;, &quot;Reba&quot;, and &quot;Foam&quot;.
*&quot;In Dreams&quot; by Roy Orbison features seven distinct sections, none of which repeat.
*&quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; and &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot; by The Beatles.
*&quot;Rudy&quot; by Supertramp from the album &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;.
*&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; by Queen.
*&quot;Halo of Flies&quot; by Alice Cooper.

<doc id="480254" wikidata="Q2373640" url="?curid=480254" title="Sydney Harbour Tunnel">
<text>The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is a twin-tube road tunnel in Sydney, Australia. The tunnel was completed and opened to traffic in August 1992 to provide a second vehicular crossing of Sydney Harbour to alleviate congestion on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It is one of two transportation tunnels under the harbour, the other being a set of rail tunnels for the Sydney Metro.

The tunnel joins the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney and the Cahill Expressway at the entrance to the Domain Tunnel. It has two lanes in each direction, and runs at an angle of approximately thirty degrees (north to south) to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which has eight lanes, with a tidal flow operation. In 2017, the tunnel was carrying around 96,000 vehicles per day.

== Construction ==

The tunnel is made up of three sections: twin land tunnels on the north shore, twin land tunnels on the south shore and a immersed tube (IMT) structure. The tunnel falls about from the northern entrance and about from the southern entrance to its deepest point, below sea level. The construction was undertaken by Thiess Contractors.

The IMT structure consists of eight precast concrete units. The units were constructed over away in a casting basin at Port Kembla and then towed to Sydney Harbour. A trench was dredged before the arrival of the IMTs and then the IMTs were lowered into the trench by a system of pontoons and control towers. After the IMTs were in place, the trenches were backfilled and then a rock armour was placed over the top to protect the units against marine hazards, such as anchors or sinking vessels. The land tunnels were constructed by a combination of driving and cut-and-cover techniques, designed to be strong enough to withstand the impact of earthquakes.
=== Ventilation ===
The northern end pylons of the Sydney Harbour Bridge were altered to allow for air exhaust from the tunnel to rise over the harbour. Bradfield Park on the northern side of the bridge also has air intakes. Fresh air is drawn by an underground ventilation station on the north shore and is pumped to all sections of the tunnel through vented ducts. The air supply uses fourteen axial flow fans, each up to in diameter. The exhaust uses sixteen (eight in each northern pylon tower) fans that draw exhaust air through two underground ducts from the tunnel ventilation station and transfer the air to the top of the pylon. They can expel it at up to – equivalent to changing all the air in the tunnel every two minutes with the capability of running in reverse in an emergency and all fans are rated for smoke extraction. Each of the fans has a duty of . The testing of the fans was one of the most comprehensive ever, covering flowrate and pressure, power measurements, sound levels, bearing vibration, x-raying of all impeller components, high-temperature tests at for two hours, impeller strain, and 24-hour run tests for reversals.

== Operations and maintenance ==
The Harbour Tunnel was a partnership between the New South Wales government and private investors by tender. Transfield and Kumagai Gumi formed a 50/50 joint venture company which constructed the tunnel under contract; with a 30-year operating contract, including revenue collection and maintenance, from 1992 until 2022. As a result of the 1997 separation of assets of Transfield and the creation of the Tenix group (owned by Olbia), the ongoing 30-year operating contract for management of the tunnel was split between Kumagai Gumi (50%), Transfield (25%) and Olbia (25%).

The total construction cost of the project was $554 million. $223 million of this was an interest-free loan from the NSW Government, to be repaid at the conclusion of the operating contract in August 2022 when the tunnel would be transferred to public ownership. The government had also guaranteed an Ensured Revenue Stream (ERS) to the operator, whereby it makes up the shortfall between toll collections and the guaranteed amount. As toll revenues have been below the projected amount, in 2008 for example, the government paid the operator $58.9 million, with the total amount forecast to be $1.1 billion from 2008 to 2022. The NSW Auditor-General had also raised concerns that the tunnel&#x27;s expenses may make the operating company default on the $223 million loan, however the government remained confident in it.

With the 30-year operating contract about to expire, in April 2022, the state government signed a 15-year contract with Ventia for the asset management, operations and maintenance of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel as well as the under-construction Western Harbour Tunnel. Tolling arrangements were unrelated to the new agreement. On 1 September 2022, the tunnel reverted back to state government ownership.

== Tolls ==
In 2006 the New South Wales government announced that all cash tolls on the Sydney Orbital Network would cease by 2010. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel went fully electronic in July 2007 with both e-TAG and e-pass video tolling arrangements in use, similar to technologies used by the Westlink M7, Cross City Tunnel and the Lane Cove Tunnel. This measure has substantially eased the traffic jams heading towards the electronic gantries, and providing increased convenience and time savings. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel attracts a varying toll (that was introduced in 2009) of between $2.50 and $4.00, depending on the time of day. The toll is levied on the southbound approach to the tunnel entrance.

Until July 2022 it was unannounced whether tolls would continue after the transfer of ownership to the state government on 1 September 2022. It was eventually announced by the state government that the toll would continue, to be used for maintenance just like the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Tolls will rise in October 2023 for the first time in 14 years.

== Exits and interchanges ==


== History ==
The tunnel was opened to the public to walk through from North Sydney (Falcon Street) to Eastern Sydney (The Domain) on 30 August 1992. The proceeds of the tickets sold for this event were donated to the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children.

The tunnel opened to traffic on 31 August 1992.

<doc id="480258" wikidata="Q27615" url="?curid=480258" title="Lovage">
<text>Lovage ( ; Levisticum officinale) is a tall perennial plant, the sole species in the genus Levisticum in the family Apiaceae, subfamily Apioideae. It has been long cultivated in Europe and the leaves are used as a herb, the roots as a vegetable, and the seeds as a spice, especially in southern European cuisine. Its flavour and smell are reminiscent both of celery and parsley, only more intense and spicier than either. The seeds can be used in the same way as fennel seeds.

==Description==

Lovage is an erect, herbaceous, perennial plant growing to tall, with a basal rosette of leaves and stems with further leaves, the flowers being produced in umbels at the top of the stems. The stems and leaves are shiny glabrous green to yellow-green and smell somewhat similar to celery when crushed. The larger basal leaves are up to long, tripinnate, with broad triangular to rhomboidal, acutely pointed leaflets with a few marginal teeth; the stem leaves are smaller, and less divided with few leaflets. The flowers are yellow to greenish-yellow, diameter, produced in globose umbels up to diameter; flowering is in late spring. The fruit is a dry two-parted schizocarp long, mature in autumn.

== Taxonomy ==
Carl Linnaeus used the basionym &quot;Ligusticum levisticum&quot; in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; to refer to lovage. &quot;Levisticum officinale&quot; was described later by W.D.J. Koch and published in &quot;Novorum Actorum Academiae Caesareae Leopoldinae-Carolinae Naturae Curiosorum&quot; in 1824.

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;lovage&quot; is from &quot;love-ache&quot;, &quot;ache&quot; being a medieval name for parsley; this is a folk-etymological modification of the older French name , from late Latin , in turn thought to be a modification of the earlier Latin , &#x27;of Liguria&#x27; (northwest Italy), where the herb was grown extensively. In modern botanical usage, both Latin forms are now used for different (but closely related) genera, with &quot;Levisticum&quot; for (culinary) lovage, and &quot;Ligusticum&quot; for Scots lovage, a similar species from northern Europe, and for related species.

==Distribution==
&quot;Levisticum officinale&quot; is native to Afghanistan and Iran, but has been introduced to most of Europe, and parts of Southeast Asia, North and South America. It has been long cultivated in Europe, the leaves being used as a herb, the roots as a vegetable, and the seeds as a spice, especially in southern European cuisine.

==Health concerns==
Lovage root contains furanocoumarins which can lead to photosensitivity.

==Uses==
The leaves can be used in salads, or to make soup or season broths, and the roots can be eaten as a vegetable or grated for use in salads. Its flavour and smell are reminiscent both of celery and parsley, only more intense and spicy than either. The seeds can be used as a spice in the same way as fennel seeds. 
The roots, which contain a heavy volatile oil, are used as a mild aquaretic.

==In culture==
A recommendation to cultivate lovage on the agricultural properties of Charlemagne appears in chapter 70 of &quot;&quot;, a text written around 800 AD about the maintenance of royal estates.

<doc id="480259" wikidata="Q9636058" url="?curid=480259" title="Indecent assault">
<text>Indecent assault is an offence of aggravated assault in some common law-based jurisdictions. It is characterised as a sex crime and has significant overlap with offences referred to as sexual assault.

==England and Wales==
Indecent assault was a broadly defined offence under sections 14 and 15 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. It was replaced, with prospective effect only, by sexual assault under section 3 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. A range of acts toward the more severe among those in its &quot;actus reus&quot; augmented other offences, including rape (section 1).

Prosecutions can proceed under sections 14 and 15 of the 1956 act for offences committed before the new law came into force.

The &quot;mens rea&quot; and &quot;actus reus&quot; of the crime are similar to that for common law assault and/or battery, but with an additional element of &quot;indecent circumstances&quot;. These were present if a &quot;reasonable person&quot; would believe the act indecent, whatever the belief of the accused.

==India==
In India it is punishable under section 354 of the Indian Penal Code. The accused may be punished up to two years&#x27; imprisonment and/or a fine.

==Australia==

In New South Wales, the offence of indecent assault is punishable under Section 61L of the Crimes Act 1900.

The &quot;mens rea&quot; and &quot;actus reus&quot; are the same for the common law offence of assault, the only distinction being that the act committed must have a sexual connotation.

<text>Thomas Patrick Keating (1 March 1917 – 12 February 1984) was an English artist, art restorer and art forger. Considered the most prolific and versatile art forger of the 20th century, he claimed to have faked more than 2,000 paintings by more than 160 different artists of unprecedented scope—ranging from the Renaissance (Holbein, Titian, Tintoretto) to Modernism, Expressionism and Fauvism (Kandinsky, Klee, Matisse)—with heavy emphasis on English landscape Romanticists and the French Impressionists. Total estimated profits from his forgeries amount in today&#x27;s value to more than $10 million.

He claimed his aim was not material gain, but rather a crusade against art dealers he believed were only interested in fine art as a commodity, for which an impressive provenance, often dubious or wholly invented, always trumped the masterful artistry and intrinsic beauty of any particular drawing or painting.

He began flooding the London art market in the early 1950s with hundreds of consistently convincing fakes, often by giving them to friends and acquaintances, with tacit expectation that many would soon end up in a posh Bond Street auction house, or gallery.

He escalated his crusade in the late 1960s and early 1970s by directing his business partner and lover, Jane Kelly, to sell several fakes of then little known romanticist, Samuel Palmer. As a result of these sales, both Keating and Kelly ended up on trial, in 1979, at the top criminal court in Britain, charged with art fraud. Kelly pleaded guilty and received an 18-month sentence, suspended for two years. After two days giving evidence, Keating ended up in hospital for a motorbike injury. He returned for a third day in court, during which he collapsed in the witness box, and was taken back to hospital. He was released without charge two weeks later due to failing health.

In 1982, he starred in an award-winning Channel 4 television series in which he instructed viewers in the intricately detailed painting techniques of his favourite Old Masters. A followup series, focusing on the Impressionists, began airing two days after his death, in 1984.

==Early life==
Keating was born into a working-class family in an overcrowded flat in Forest Hill, South London. As a youth, living hand to mouth on his father&#x27;s shilling-and-sixpence hourly wage as a house painter, he helped his mother make ends meet by collecting and selling horse manure, running errands for neighbours, and taking parcels to the local pawn shop. Growing up he worked as a delivery boy, lather boy, lift boy and bellboy before finally joining the family business as a house painter.

=== Art classes ===
He discovered his love and early talent for picture-making at Eltham College primary school in Kent. Having run away from home to visit his grandmother seven miles away, he ended up staying for three years, trading persistent poverty and grim prospects for regular home-cooked meals and a headmistress who was also an art teacher, who encouraged him to spend as much time as he liked drawing and painting owls, foxes, badgers, and a sailing ship. When his grandmother died, he returned to Forest Hill.

At the age of 14, he passed an entrance exam for the nearby, prestigious, St Dunstan&#x27;s College, but was crestfallen when told the impossible sum required for clothes and books needed just to start. He returned to odd jobs and house painting, developing his own talent for detailing woodwork, graining, marbling, and sign writing.

=== Navy tour ===
Keating was called up to the Royal Navy in the spring of 1940, finishing his training in time to face combat at Dunkirk, before setting off for Singapore aboard the SS &quot;Strathmore&quot;. He spent the next three years in the South China Sea on a variety of vessels, also spending time in hospital for a range of illnesses, including shock, and injuries he attributed to the abuse of fellow crewmen and officers dubious of a sailor who spent all his free time on his own, reading and drawing, instead of carousing with the rest of them.

On 15 September 1943, he was posted to the frigate HMS &quot;Lagan&quot; as a stoker first class, and sent into the Battle of the Atlantic, escorting a convoy of merchant supply ships from Liverpool to New York. After suffering major defeats four months earlier, the German U-boat offensive had been withdrawn from the North Atlantic, awaiting tactical and technical improvements, which were now complete. In the small hours of 20 September 1943, the &quot;Lagan&quot; became the first Allied warship to be hit by the new T5 acoustic torpedo, which tore off her entire stern, killing more than a quarter of the crew, and leaving the remainder dead in the water southwest of Iceland, about a third of the way into their journey. The &quot;Lagan&quot; was towed back to Merseyside. Nerves shattered and his back badly injured by Hedgehog shrapnel, Keating was sent home to hospital for psychiatric treatment – a fortnight in an induced coma, then discharged with a disability pension of 17 shillings a week. He soon married his wife Ellen, with whom he had two children, Douglas, and Linda. They separated in 1952.

=== Self-taught ===
Keating always claimed he learned his most important skills as an artist through independent study and experimentation on his own. His early sources of inspiration were chiefly Venetian School father of the Renaissance, Titian; Baroque Dutch master Rembrandt, pioneering British portrait and landscape painter Thomas Gainsborough, and the Romanticists Goya, Turner and Constable. He divined their secrets by spending countless hours scrutinising and sketching examples of their work in Britain&#x27;s greatest museums, especially the National Gallery, The Royal Academy and the Tate.

In 1950, he was given for his service in the war a two-year course at Goldsmiths&#x27; College, and a grant from the Ministry of Labour of £4 and 5 shillings a week (£4.20 in decimal currency). He supplemented this by working nights and weekends, but was seldom able to simultaneously manage all the expenses of essential art supplies and feeding his family. He then discovered he lacked the prerequisite A-levels to qualify for a teaching certificate. He was disappointed with the calibre of technical training on offer, and had little interest in the modern art movements in vogue at the time (he was ridiculed for praising the work of Pietro Annigoni, who only a few years later was commissioned to paint a popular portrait of the Queen). He failed two final exams––praised for &quot;painterly technique&quot;, thwarted by his composition&#x27;s &quot;insufficient originality&quot;.

Never immune to self-contradiction, Keating told a journalist in May 1977 he had to unlearn everything he was taught at Goldsmith&#x27;s. In his autobiography published the following month, he credited some of the training he received there with getting him started on a career.

== Art restorer ==
While studying at Goldsmith’s, Keating secured a part-time job as a restorer, at the well-respected Hahn Brothers, in Mayfair, where he began meticulously filling thousands of tiny cracks in old pictures. The breadth of his expertise in painting techniques quickly expanded, however, when he began taking more challenging jobs on the shady fringes of the London art market, where he learned to skilfully mimic the methods of scores of lesser-known artists, in the course of figuring out how to fix them. A typical instruction he got in such establishments was, ‘here, show us what you can do with this’.

While working in a small shop for a man called Fred Roberts, he was asked to replace a herd of grazing cattle––that had been obliterated by the repair of a large tear in a 19th-century painting by Thomas Sidney Cooper––with laughing children dancing around a maypole, dramatically enhancing the picture&#x27;s charm. So impressed was he with several of Keating&#x27;s &quot;repairs&quot;, Roberts framed them, added a forged signature, and put them up in a nearby showroom for hundreds, even thousands of pounds, all while paying Keating slave wages, generally £5 to £10 per week. 

When Keating discovered some Frank Moss Bennetts he had nearly completely repainted for Roberts on offer at a posh West End gallery for £1,500 to £3,000, he was so disgusted he dashed back, gave Roberts an earful of expletives and quit on the spot, hurling a palette at him as a parting gesture.

When he later found evidence of similar subterfuge rampant throughout the trade—dealers raking in cash while his wife and children were stuck in a damp, dilapidated flat, with scant, tattered furniture and often little to eat—he decided he too could play at that game. A forger was born, with a sense of righteous indignation and a desire for vengeance that plagued him the rest of his life; baffling those who thought his tremendous talent could be put to far better use; landing him in the Old Bailey on charges for fraud; bringing him post-trial wealth and fame; and condemning him––through the stress on his health of violent mood swings and massive consumption of tobacco and alcohol––to an early death.

==Crusade against the art world==
Keating never got rich off the fakes he produced, rather he often gave them away as gifts, bartered them for food, booze, and rent, or sold them for a pittance to friends and acquaintances, even the local gas man.

Keating&#x27;s main objective was a vendetta against corrupt, predatory art dealers whom he believed victimised both artists and the buying public. Not long after finding a number of old pictures that he had been ordered to &quot;enhance&quot; were on sale nearby for inflated prices, he was taken in by an even more perfidious employer. Keating would often stay after hours painting pictures in the styles of other artists he admired, to study their techniques. One evening his boss discovered him finishing a pastiche of a wintry Canadian scene, à la Cornelius Krieghoff. The man offered to purchase it, and asked him to do another, for which he paid him $15 each. Keating later learned they were sold at a London Gallery for more than $3,000. 

He retaliated by disseminating quantities of fakes of sufficient quality to fool the experts, hoping to destabilize the system. At one point in the 1950s, so many &quot;newly-discovered&quot; Krieghoffs had come on the market that prices were acutely depressed, over fears many were fake, neatly achieving two of Keating&#x27;s goals: to reduce the profits of greedy art dealers, and to make beautiful pictures from one of his favourite artists more affordable to the buying public. Some twenty years later, a Sotheby&#x27;s expert on Canadian art lamented, due to unceasing difficulties in making a firm identification of Krieghoff&#x27;s work, that instead of listing them under the artist&#x27;s full name – to indicate full confidence in their authenticity – they catalogued paintings in a 1976 auction as merely, &quot;attributed to Krieghoff&quot;. Prices however, had made a handsome recovery; they sold for $11,000–$13,000.

Keating considered himself a socialist and used his political views to rationalize his actions. He deliberately left clues to equip fellow art restorers, conservators and merchants to discover his deception. Sometimes he would put a layer of glycerine under oil paint so that when a picture would be cleaned the solvents would dissolve the glycerin and the paint layer would disintegrate, revealing the picture as a fake. Or when beginning a picture, he would paint messages on canvases in lead white that could easily be revealed with x-rays. Occasionally he found frames still labelled with Christie&#x27;s catalogue numbers and would contact the auction house to learn what paintings they had contained. He would then paint similar pictures in the same artist&#x27;s style and use the frames to imply a false provenance for them. He would also use modern acrylics and varnishes on paintings supposedly from previous centuries. Contemporary copyists of old masters use similar practices to guard against accusations of fraud.

==Techniques of the old masters==
To create his many Samuel Palmer fakes he would often mix sepia with glutinous tree gum, apply thick coats of varnish, then heat them to develop craquelure, to make them appear old. For his Rembrandt drawings he would use 18th-century paper and make walnut ink by boiling walnuts for ten hours and filtering the result through silk stockings. 

He bristled at being called a forger, claiming he never truly copied any pictures, rather he did new pictures that looked like they were done by others. In a 1977 BBC documentary he described a kind of hierarchy of terms for various types of imitation:

Copy – an exact duplicate, such as those often displayed in place of an original kept safe in a vault

Repaint – the result of heedless, heavy-handed restoration

Pastiche – a variation of an existing painting, or a new picture that mimics another artist’s style

Fake – a pastiche that has been doctored up to look like an original

Forgery – a fake with another artist&#x27;s signature added and false provenance provided

Though not always consistent in his own use of these distinctions, by far his favourite term for what he did was, Sexton Blake. The name of the long-running fictional detective was commonly used from the early twentieth century to mean, &quot;cake&quot;. Keating revised and popularized its use as rhyming slang for &quot;fake&quot;.

Keating took advantage of a safety net major London auction houses employ in the form of their conditions of sale, which limit responsibility for the accuracy of attributions. They have three levels of catalog entries: &quot;John Constable&quot; means they believe a picture is authentic. &quot;J. Constable&quot; means they believe it to be from his school and possibly by the master. &quot;Constable&quot; means it is in his style but could be an imitation of any date.

Though nothing approaching the 2,000 fakes that Keating claimed to have produced have ever been identified, he did describe in varying levels of detail the &quot;artist&quot;; the &quot;subject&quot; matter; the &quot;media&quot; (oils on old canvases and board, acrylics, pastels, drawings and watercolours on old and modern paper); the &quot;source&quot; of inspiration (mostly books); and the &quot;time&quot; period and &quot;location&quot; (Forest Hill in the late 1930s, Kew in the 1950s and early &#x27;60s, Suffolk in the late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s, Tenerife from 1971-74) where he did several hundred of them. Artists he claimed to have faked in large quantities include more than 100 Cornelius Krieghoff paintings, about 80 Samuel Palmer paintings and drawings, 40-50 Constantine Guys drawings, 30-60 Degas drawings and pastels, about 20 JMW Turner watercolours, perhaps 20 Renoir charcoal drawings and pastels (plus one oil painting), quantities of Constable and Gainsborough drawings, lots of Rembrandt drawings, lots of Sisley paintings and Francesco Guardi drawings, quite a few George Rouault gouaches, a lot of Thomas Rowlandson drawings tinted with watercolour, a dozen Modigliani drawings and paintings of long necked ladies, several Hans Holbein the Elder drawings (and one oil), several David Teniers paintings on panel, several Thomas Girtin drawings, several Edvard Munch acrylics, and several Matisse drawings, watercolours and gouaches. He also claimed to have done a half dozen Manet oils (and two or three drawings), a half dozen Pissarro oils, some Richard Wilson drawings (and two or three oils), a few Toulouse Lautrec drawings (and one painting) and one or two pictures in the manner of Tintoretto, Rubens, Dürer, Stubbs, Goya, John Linnell and Paul Klee.

A much smaller list of fakes the police, and various art dealers and journalists were actually able to track down in the 1970s, which Keating identified as his own work, included 26 Samuel Palmers, 9 Constables, 8 Krieghoffs, 7 Degas, 7 Kees van Dongens, 5 Edvard Munch paintings, 4 Renoirs, 4 Constantine Guys, 4 Modiglianis, and one or two in the manner of Rembrandt, Francesco Gardi, Gainsborough, Goya, Linnell, Henri Fantin-Latour, Auguste Rodin, Jean Louis Forain, Toulouse Lautrec, Emile Bernard, Raoul Dufy, Wassily Kandinsky, and Frank Moss Bennett.

== Relationship with Jane Kelly ==
In the summer of 1963, 46-year-old Keating, met 16-year-old Jane Kelly, in the Railway Café at Kew Gardens Station–opposite his flat, and just across an historic footbridge from her family home. Having recently relocated from Llangyndeyrn, Wales, Kelly quickly joined a group of young people she found gathered round a charming older man perched at the end of the bar, regaling them with wild stories of war, protest, and Art World treachery. Keating gave informal painting lessons to several of them. Impressed with her keen ambition and precocious intellect, he soon took on his first and only formal mentorship, with Kelly. From early childhood, she had grown up studying a number of rare sketch books her great grandfather, Thomas Farr, had made in British Ceylon in the 1890s. The pioneering tea planter, artist, and early conservationist made detailed field drawings and vivid watercolours, which inspired Kelly to become an artist. She soon became Keating&#x27;s full-time student and apprentice. Four years later, the two began a life together in Suffolk, where they started an art restoration business.

==Revealing the forger==

In February 1970, Geraldine Norman, sale room correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; of London, reported the sale of a rare painting from Samuel Palmer&#x27;s Shoreham period, which mainly depicted moonlit scenes of shepherds and sheep from around his home in Shoreham, Kent. A nearly life-sized photo of the picture accompanied the article. Entitled &quot;Sepham Barn&quot;, it was purchased for £9,400, by Harold Leger, of Leger Galleries, Old Bond Street in London.

A month later, &quot;The Times&quot; published a letter from art expert David Gould claiming the picture to be a fake. Mrs. Norman continued to receive reports of more new Palmer pictures appearing in the market, along with claims from David Gould that all of them were fakes. In March 1976, she began investigating them, enlisting the assistance of Palmer experts from the Ashmolean Museum, the Tate Museum, the British Museum, and the Fitzwilliam Museum, as well as author Geoffrey Grigson.

In July 1976 the first of a series of articles by Norman on fake Palmers was published on page one of &quot;The Times&quot;. Thirteen previously unknown Palmers that had appeared on the market in the past decade were all declared fake. Five of them had come from a single source: Jane Kelly. Norman was unable to reach Miss Kelly but received several phone calls with tips including one from Miss Kelly&#x27;s brother, who brought photos from Keating&#x27;s studio, revealing that Tom Keating was the forger she was looking for.

Soon after, she drove to East Anglia and found Keating at his studio in Lower Park, Dedham, Essex. He welcomed her inside, told her all about his life as a restorer and artist, and poured out an extensive rant about his fight against the art establishment as a working-class socialist. He initially refused to discuss anything about Samuel Palmer or Jane Kelly. A little over a week after their meeting (and a month after the first article), &quot;The Times&quot; published another article by Norman, writing about Keating&#x27;s life and the many allegations of forgery against him. In response, Keating wrote a letter to The Times, saying: &quot;I do not deny these allegations. In fact, I openly confess to having done them.&quot; He also declared that money was not his incentive. Though Norman was the one to expose him, Keating did not feel resentment towards her. Instead, he said that she was sympathetic, respectful of his radical politics, and appreciative of him as an artist. Norman&#x27;s series of nine articles on Keating garnered her the British Press Awards News Reporter of the Year for 1976. 

The ensuing investigation and build up to trial received expansive coverage in the London press and around the world. In the 12 months from Norman’s first exposé in July 1976, to Keating’s arrest in July 1977, &quot;The Times&quot; ran 54 stories, many on page one: &quot;Art world seeks fakes inquiry&quot;. &quot;Museum confirms tests show &#x27;Palmer&#x27; is fake&quot;. &quot;Mr. Keating identifies 28 paintings as his own work&quot;. 

In the US, &quot;TIME&quot; magazine ran “Art: Palming off the Palmers.” &quot;The New York Times&quot; published &quot;London painter and restorer admits flooding art market with forgeries&quot;, and, “Watercolorgate – Whimsey, Fakery, and Esthetic Truth”.

In January 1977, Keating visited top galleries in Canada, and the vast private collections of billionaire newspaper and television magnate, Ken Thompson, to see if they had any of his fake Cornelius Krieghoffs. The artist being something of a national favourite, the Canadian press trailed him throughout his stay. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; announced: &quot;Krieghoff Imitator spots none of his fakes at art gallery&quot;, and directed readers to a CTV interview with “Tom Keating, world&#x27;s greatest art forger”. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; did a six-page colour spread: &quot;Tom Keating&#x27;s life is imitating art&quot;. 

&quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; published a detailed interview with &quot;The Master Art Forger&quot;.

After Keating sent his &quot;mea culpa&quot; letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, in one of 17 articles on the Keating affaire, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; blazoned the top of page 1 with, &quot;I FAKED THE LOT!&quot;. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; declared, &quot;Fake artist draws in the crowds&quot;, when due to public demand, The Cecil Higgins museum in Bedford pressed Scotland Yard for the early return of a Palmer fake they had had on display for the past ten years, so they could re-hang it next to their three authentic ones. Dozens of letters to the editor appeared in the London press – a few from art dealers venting outrage; most from readers expressing amusement and delight with Keating&#x27;s exploits and roguish charm.

== Trial at the Old Bailey ==
Keating and Jane Kelly were arrested in 1977, both accused of conspiracy to defraud, and obtaining payments through deception amounting to £21,416. The decision to try their case at the top criminal court in Britain was unprecedented—no art fraud case had ever been heard in Court No. 1 at the Old Bailey. It began in January 1979, and was a top daily news story in the London press for a month and a half, with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; posting more than three dozen reports. Proclaimed by &quot;The Observer&quot; as &quot;the best show in town, where they have been packing them in for weeks&quot;, it was periodically carried round the world via Reuters and the Associated Press.

Kelly pleaded guilty, and promised to testify against Keating. Detective Inspector Peter Goodall, the Scotland Yard Art and Antiques Squad investigator who prepared the case for the prosecution against Keating and Kelly, surprisingly gave evidence sympathetic to the latter, declaring that Keating appeared to have exerted a “Svengali-like” influence over her.

Keating pleaded innocent, claiming that he had never intentionally defrauded anyone, and had left clues that ought to have revealed his deceptions to any expert who examined them. His defence barrister, Jeremy Hutchinson, QC, mounted a strong case intended to &quot;arouse in the minds of the jury a suspicion that the greedy dealers were well aware that the works might not be genuine, but that the possibility of making a substantial profit overcame their scruples.&quot; He called to the witness box many of the same art experts Mrs. Norman consulted for her exposé, one of whom echoed Hutchinson&#x27;s colourful suggestion that a bat hovering in the background of one of Keating&#x27;s Palmer pastiches looked &quot;more like a Boeing 707&quot;. His final witness was Brian Sewell, &quot;Britain&#x27;s most famous and controversial art critic&quot; who later said, &quot;my role was to pour cold water on the art establishment. As far as I could see, it was the establishment which should be in the dock, not Tom Keating, for being so credulous and setting themselves up as experts when they had been so easily seduced.&quot;

Kelly received a felony conviction, for obtaining money by deception, and a was given an 18-month custodial sentence, suspended for two years. After two days giving evidence, Keating was hospitalised for a motorbike accident. He returned for a third day in court, during which he collapsed in the witness box, and was returned to hospital. He was released without charge two weeks later due to failing health. The prosecutor dropped the case, declaring &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;.

==Crusader vindicated==
The same year Keating was arrested (1977), he published his autobiography with Geraldine and Frank Norman. A 2005 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that after the trial was halted, &quot;the public warmed to him, believing him a charming old rogue.&quot; Years of chain smoking and the effects of breathing the fumes of chemicals used in art restoring, such as ammonia, turpentine and methyl alcohol, together with the stress induced by the court case, had taken their toll. Through 1982 and 1983, however, Keating rallied at the prospect of finally fulfilling a long-held ambition to be a teacher; to encourage others to paint. Though still in fragile health, he accepted a proposal to star in a (UK) Channel 4 television series called &quot;Tom Keating on Painters&quot; (see more below).

A year before his death, Keating stated in a television interview that in his opinion, he was not an especially good painter. Yet many art collectors and celebrities, such as the ex-heavyweight boxer Henry Cooper, had already begun to collect his work. In December 1983, hoping to raise sufficient funds to buy himself a new cottage, Keating sent 137 of his pictures to be auctioned at Christie&#x27;s in London. In a significant policy change—selling commercial pictures by a self-confessed faker—they accepted them, signed by Keating, but &quot;in the style of&quot; other artists. Exceeding the wildest expectations of auctioneer David Collins, nearly 800 people packed the sales room, and every lot was sold, raising £72,000. The top price was £5,500 for his &quot;Hay Wain in Reverse&quot;, which had been featured in the &quot;Constable&quot; episode of his television series. He never received the proceeds, having died of a heart attack two months later, aged 66.

Keating is buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin at Dedham (a scene painted numerous times by Sir Alfred Munnings). His last painting, &quot;The Angel of Dedham&quot;, can be found in the church&#x27;s secured Muniment Library.

Five more auctions of his works were held. In September 1984, more than a thousand people squeezed into Christie&#x27;s South Kensington sale rooms to bid on 202 paintings and sketches put up for sale by his son and daughter. The event fetched £274,000 – about 20 times higher than the printed estimates in the catalogue. A 1983 picture called &quot;Monet and his Family in their Houseboat&quot; sold for £16,000. A Sisley imitation brought £8,500. A self-portrait &quot;after the style of&quot; Rembrandt yielded £7,500. Several others that had been expected to fetch between £200 and £400, including pastiches of Renoir and Van Gogh, went for £5,000 or £6,000. Christie&#x27;s auctioneer David Collins later said: &quot;The prices paid represented the ground swell of public support for Keating. He was a talented artist and a great character in the art world.&quot;

In December 1989, the last works from Keating&#x27;s studio raised £166,000 in a sale at Bonhams, including a record price for a Keating—£26,400 for his pastiche of Turner&#x27;s &quot;The Fighting Temeraire&quot;. In December 1990, another sale at Bonhams brought £109,000 for 51 paintings. A third sale at Bonhams in August 1991 featured some Keatings alongside paintings by forger Elmyr de Hory.

The final sale held in December 1998 by Vost&#x27;s of Newmarket, of 85 mainly small, unframed watercolours, pastels and drawings, and a few oil paintings, came from the estate of Jane Kelly, who died of brain cancer in 1992. It was held at Layer Marney Tower, not far from Keating&#x27;s old studio. More than 700 people turned up. A sale expected to raise £15,000 at the most, brought £128,000. &quot;Odalisque, in the manner of Matisse&quot;, a portrait of Kelly dressed as a Turkish concubine, fetched £6,700. The top price of £7,500 was paid for &quot;At the races, in the manner of Degas&quot;, which had an estimated price of only £400. A Modigliani pastiche brought £5,800; an oil self-portrait fetched £5,000.

Keating&#x27;s work has itself been faked. The 2005 &quot;Guardian&quot; article states: &quot;Dodgy paintings in Keating&#x27;s original style, proudly bearing what looks like his signature, are finding their way into the market. If they manage to fool, they can claim £5,000 to £10,000. But if uncovered they are virtually worthless, much like Keating&#x27;s 20 years ago. If you can pick them up for next to nothing, they may be a better investment than an original Keating counterfeit.&quot;

== Works ==
* Major restoration of the Louis Laguerre murals depicting the Battle of Blenheim in the West Staircase at Marlborough House.
* &quot;The Hay Wain in Reverse&quot;, his best known painting, is a pastiche of John Constable&#x27;s celebrated, &quot;The Hay Wain&quot;. It is reportedly on display in the Granary Barn and Museum in Flatford.
* &quot;Turner at Greenwich&quot;, the reverse Temeraire shown in the &quot;Turner&quot; episode of &quot;Tom Keating On Painters.&quot;
* &quot;A Barn at Shoreham&quot;, a Samuel Palmer pastiche purchased by the Cecil Higgins Museum in Bedford in 1965, on advice by Edward Croft Murray, the Keeper of Pictures at the British Museum, that it was authentic. They took it down in August 1976 when it was discovered to be a Keating fake. They rehung it four months later. Museum trustees commented &#x27;that there seemed to be more public interest in the drawing now it was known to be a fake than there had been in the genuine article.&#x27; &quot;A Barn at Shoreham&quot; remains on view in the museum&#x27;s art store.

== Television series ==

=== &quot;A Picture of Tom Keating&quot; ===
Subtitled &quot;An exclusive study of a master forger&quot;, this BBC1 special broadcast on 3 May 1977, featured an interview of Keating in his studio, demonstrating how he produced fakes of Renoir, Degas and Palmer. He claimed he duped the so-called experts because he wanted to expose the dubious practices of art dealers. He also discussed his relationship with Jane Kelly, and their restoration business at Wattisfield Hall, in East Anglia, and later at Vilaflor in Tenerife.

The programme was rebroadcast on BBC2 on 6 August 1979, with a new sequence that covered Keating&#x27;s trial in February.

=== &quot;Tom Keating On Painters&quot; ===
Keating&#x27;s award-winning first educational series began airing on 4 November 1982, two days after the launch of Britain&#x27;s fourth television station. Channel 4 enticed viewers by inviting them to: &quot;Watch the great 16th century Italian painter Tom Keating (who) believes the spirits of the Old Masters sometimes enter him as he works on a canvas. Tonight, in the first of a series, watch Titian paint &#x27;Tarquin and Lucretia&#x27; through Keating.&quot;

In each half-hour episode, filmed in his private studio in Dedham, a soft-spoken Keating displayed a depth of knowledge and range of technical skills that astonished many viewers. A &quot;Times&quot; television critic commenting on the Rembrandt episode wrote: &quot;Tom Keating does more than just break new ground in art appreciation. Other art experts limit themselves to indicating areas of great paintings and explaining this, that, and the other. Mr. Keating goes one better by first putting himself into the Old Master&#x27;s shoes, then insinuating himself into their minds, and finally putting paint to canvas with an uncanny command of the original style. &quot;Instruction by example:&quot; that is the Keating approach.&quot;

The show was the realisation of a lifelong yearning to pass on to others the Old Master techniques he had taught himself. Thousands of art teachers and students continue to study them. In 2006, television personality Magnus Magnusson compared its popularity with Kenneth Clark&#x27;s 1969 BBC series &quot;Civilisation&quot;.

He would begin each episode with a brief life history of the artist, including aesthetic influences and interactions with other famous painters, then quickly demonstrate the compositional development, sketching and painting techniques of one of his favourite mentors, each among the most revered fine artists in history. In March the following year, the programme captured the Broadcasting Press Guild&#x27;s award for &quot;Best on-screen performance in a non-acting role&quot; for Keating. Both series were released on VHS in 1983.

&quot;Turner&quot; – &quot;In his day people had a need, an urge to escape the ugliness of life,&quot; Keating explains. &quot;They hid themselves in their paintings, looking at them. So he created another world of colour, magic and mystery.&quot; Keating draws and paints a reverse rendering of &quot;The Fighting Temeraire&quot;.

&quot;Titian&quot; – Keating illustrates Titian&#x27;s multilayered painting techniques by creating a copy of &quot;Tarquin and Lucretia&quot;.

&quot;Constable&quot; – Keating reviews the history of the making of &quot;The Hay Wain&quot;. Then recreates another version of his &quot;Hay Wain in Reverse&quot;.

&quot;Rembrandt&quot; – Keating paints a pastiche combining a Rembrandt self-portrait with a portrait of his son Titus.

&quot;Degas&quot; – Keating demonstrates the making of &quot;The Ballet Class&quot;, in pastel.

&quot;Restoration&quot; – Keating gives viewers a tour of the Louis Laguerre murals he restored in the West Staircase at Marlborough House, which depict the Battle of Blenheim. He then retreats to The Marlborough Head, his local pub in Dedham, to collect an old landscape painting the landlord has asked him to clean, quipping: &quot;He&#x27;s paying me one pint a day for the next 14 years.&quot; Back in his studio, he demonstrates how to carefully remove the picture from its frame, strip off the grimy old varnish, and apply a fresh coat.
=== &quot;Tom Keating On Impressionism&quot; ===

&quot;Rousseau, Boudin, Pissarro&quot; – In the first episode of his second instructional series, Keating reviews the history of the development of French Impressionism, and how various Impressionists influenced one another. He demonstrates the creation of &quot;en plain air&quot; views of the forest of Fontainebleau, in the manner of Rousseau; a seaside promenade in the style of Boudin; and a view through wispy trees of a house in the countryside, in the mode of Pissarro.

&quot;Manet&quot; – Keating does a copy of Manet&#x27;s nude, &quot;Olympia&quot;.

&quot;Monet&quot; - Keating does a copy of &quot;Vétheuil in Winter&quot;, demonstrating effects Monet captured by painting the village from his boat on an icy River Seine.

&quot;Renoir&quot; – Working with a live model, Keating begins a pastiche of a portrait of young lady, seated, with a letter and a vase of flowers. 

&quot;Van Gogh&quot; – A vase of fake flowers at his side, Keating creates a &quot;Sunflowers&quot; still-life, combined with, from memory, a &quot;self-portrait&quot; of Vincent. In place of the usual brief introduction, he presents the most heartfelt and comprehensive biography of the series, right through the entire episode. He suggests the genius was not mad, but merely exceptionally sensitive, and depressed over arguments with Theo, but otherwise reacting normally to pain, despair, and loneliness. “He had these intense eyes, emphasised by ginger eyebrows and red hair, giving him this appearance…this rather frightening expression, that is often mistaken for madness… We lost him because of the stupidity of people. And he shot &quot;himself&quot;, when he should&#x27;ve gone out, &quot;I think,&quot; and shot a few art dealers…&quot; who soon began making &quot;a king&#x27;s ransom&quot; from his pictures.

&quot;Cezanne&quot; – Keating does a still-life of wine and fresh fruit.

==In popular culture==
In the 2002 film &quot;The Good Thief&quot;, Nick Nolte&#x27;s character claims to own a painting that Picasso did for him after losing a bet, and when it is exposed as a fake, he claims it was painted for him by Keating after meeting him in a betting shop.

The fourth track, titled &quot;Judas Unrepentant&quot;, on progressive rock band Big Big Train&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;English Electric (Part One)&quot; is based on the life of Keating as an artist. According to the blog of Big Big Train vocalist David Longdon, the song walks through Keating&#x27;s artistic life from his time as a restorer to his death and posthumous fame.

<doc id="480273" wikidata="Q4862898" url="?curid=480273" title="Baron Waterpark">
<text>Baron Waterpark of Waterpark in the County of Cork, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1792 for Sarah, Lady Cavendish, in honour of her husband, Sir Henry Cavendish, 2nd Baronet. Sir Henry Cavendish was a politician who represented Lismore and Killybegs in the Irish House of Commons and served as Vice-Treasurer of Ireland and as Receiver-General of Ireland. From 1768 to 1774 he sat in the British House of Commons for Lostwithiel. 

Cavendish and Lady Waterpark were both succeeded by their son Richard, the second Baron and third Baronet. His eldest son, the third Baron, represented Knaresborough, Derbyshire South and Lichfield in the House of Commons as a Liberal and served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip) under Lord John Russell, Lord Aberdeen and Lord Palmerston. This line of the family failed on the death of his grandson, the fifth Baron, in 1932. The late Baron was succeeded by his second cousin, the sixth Baron. He was the grandson of a younger son of the second Baron. , the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great-nephew, the eighth Baron, who succeeded in that year. 

The Cavendish baronetcy, of Doveridge Hall, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1755 for Henry Cavendish. He notably represented Lismore in the Irish House of Commons. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned Sir Henry Cavendish, 2nd Baronet. The Cavendishes of Doveridge were descended from Henry Cavendish, illegitimate son of another Henry Cavendish, of Tutbury Priory. This Henry was the eldest son of Sir William Cavendish by his wife Bess of Hardwick, and thus elder brother of William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire. 

The family seat of Doveridge Hall was demolished about 1938. There were other illegitimate sons sired in Derbyshire by Henry Cavendish. One son, Robert Cavendish, was allegedly the result of a lifelong relationship with a mistress whom he kept at Ufton Manor in Oakerthorpe.

<doc id="480282" wikidata="Q3046593" url="?curid=480282" title="Maxwell material">
<text>A Maxwell material is the most simple model viscoelastic material showing properties of a typical liquid. It shows viscous flow on the long timescale, but additional elastic resistance to fast deformations. It is named for James Clerk Maxwell who proposed the model in 1867. It is also known as a Maxwell fluid. A generalization of the scalar relation to a tensor equation lacks motivation from more microscopic models and does not comply with the concept of material objectivity. However, these criteria are fulfilled by the Upper-convected Maxwell model.

== Definition ==

The Maxwell model is represented by a purely viscous damper and a purely elastic spring connected in series, as shown in the diagram. If, instead, we connect these two elements in parallel, we get the generalized model of a solid Kelvin–Voigt material.

In Maxwell configuration, under an applied axial stress, the total stress, formula_1 and the total strain, formula_2 can be defined as follows:

:formula_3
:formula_4

where the subscript D indicates the stress–strain in the damper and the subscript S indicates the stress–strain in the spring. Taking the derivative of strain with respect to time, we obtain:

:formula_5

where &quot;E&quot; is the elastic modulus and &quot;η&quot; is the material coefficient of viscosity. This model describes the damper as a Newtonian fluid and models the spring with Hooke&#x27;s law.
In a Maxwell material, stress &quot;σ&quot;, strain &quot;ε&quot; and their rates of change with respect to time &quot;t&quot; are governed by equations of the form:

:formula_6

or, in dot notation:

:formula_7

The equation can be applied either to the shear stress or to the uniform tension in a material. In the former case, the viscosity corresponds to that for a Newtonian fluid. In the latter case, it has a slightly different meaning relating stress and rate of strain.

The model is usually applied to the case of small deformations. For the large deformations we should include some geometrical non-linearity. For the simplest way of generalizing the Maxwell model, refer to the upper-convected Maxwell model.

== Effect of a sudden deformation ==
If a Maxwell material is suddenly deformed and held to a strain of formula_8, then the stress decays on a characteristic timescale of formula_9, known as the relaxation time. The phenomenon is known as stress relaxation.

The picture shows dependence of dimensionless stress formula_10 
upon dimensionless time formula_11:

If we free the material at time formula_12, then the elastic element will spring back by the value of

:formula_13

Since the viscous element would not return to its original length, the irreversible component of deformation can be simplified to the expression below:

:formula_14

==Effect of a sudden stress ==

If a Maxwell material is suddenly subjected to a stress formula_15, then the elastic element would suddenly deform and the viscous element would deform with a constant rate:

:formula_16

If at some time formula_12 we released the material, then the deformation of the elastic element would be the spring-back deformation and the deformation of the viscous element would not change:

:formula_18

:formula_19

The Maxwell model does not exhibit creep since it models strain as linear function of time.

If a small stress is applied for a sufficiently long time, then the irreversible strains become large. Thus, Maxwell material is a type of liquid.

== Effect of a constant strain rate ==
If a Maxwell material is subject to a constant strain rate formula_20then the stress increases, reaching a constant value of 

formula_21

In general 

formula_22
== Dynamic modulus ==

The complex dynamic modulus of a Maxwell material would be:

:formula_23

Thus, the components of the dynamic modulus are :

:formula_24

and

:formula_25
The picture shows relaxational spectrum for Maxwell material. The relaxation time constant is formula_26.

<text>The South African Air Force (SAAF) is the air warfare branch of South African National Defence Force, with its headquarters in Pretoria. The South African Air Force was established on 1 February 1920. The Air Force saw service in World War II and the Korean War. From 1966, the SAAF was involved in providing infantry support in the low-intensity Border War in Angola, South-West Africa and Rhodesia. As the war progressed, the intensity of air operations increased, until in the late 1980s when the SAAF were compelled to fly fighter missions against Angolan aircraft in order to maintain tactical air superiority. On conclusion of the Border War in 1990, aircraft numbers were severely reduced due to economic pressures as well as the cessation of hostilities with neighbouring states.

Beyers (who was then Commandant-General of the Defence Force) gave an extremely positive report on the future use of aircraft for military purposes to General Smuts. Smuts initiated an arrangement with private fliers in the Cape and established a flying school at Alexandersfontein near Kimberley, known as the Paterson Aviation Syndicate School, to train pilots for the proposed South African Aviation Corps. Flying training commenced in 1913 with students who excelled on the course being sent to the Central Flying School at Upavon in Great Britain for further training. The first South African military pilot qualified on 2 June 1914.

On the outbreak of the First World War, the Union Defence Force had realised the urgent need for air support which brought about the establishment of the South African Aviation Corps (SAAC) on 29 January 1915. Aircraft were purchased from France (Henri Farman F-27) while the building of an airfield at Walvis Bay commenced in earnest in order to support operations against German forces in German South West Africa. By June 1915 the SAAC was deployed to its first operational airfield at Karibib in German South West Africa in support of Gen. Botha&#x27;s South African ground forces. The SAAC flew reconnaissance and leaflet dropping missions from Karibib and later from Omaruru, where improvised bombing missions were added when pilots started dropping hand grenades and rudimentary bombs by hand. On 9 July 1915, the German forces capitulated and most of the pilots and aircraft of the SAAC were sent to Britain in support of the Imperial war effort.

Although the SAAC remained active, its activities were limited to ground training at the Cape Town Drill Hall, while the pilots who had been detached to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) were grouped to form No. 26 Squadron RFC and later becoming an independent squadron on 8 October 1915. No. 26 Squadron was equipped with Henri Farman F-27&#x27;s and B.E.2c&#x27;s and was shipped to Kenya in support of the war effort in German East Africa, landing in Mombasa on 31 January 1916. The squadron flew reconnaissance and observer missions throughout the campaign until February 1918 when the squadron returned to the UK via Cape Town and arrived at Blandford Camp on 8 July 1918 and was disbanded the same day. While the SAAC were engaged in German South West Africa and 26 Sqdn RFC in East Africa, many South Africans traveled to the United Kingdom to enlist with the Royal Flying Corps. The number of South Africans in the RFC eventually reached approximately 3,000 men and suffered 260 active-duty fatalities over the Somme during the war. Forty-six pilots became fighter aces.

===Founding and the inter-war period===

On conclusion of the First World War, the British Government donated surplus aircraft plus spares and sufficient equipment to provide the nucleus of a fledgling air force to each of its Dominions. As part of this donation, which was to become known as the Imperial Gift, South Africa received a total of 113 aircraft from both the British Government (100 aircraft) as well as from other sources (13 aircraft).

On 1 February 1920 Colonel Pierre van Ryneveld was appointed as the Director Air Service with the task of forming an air force, the date is used to mark the founding of the South African Air Force. In December 1920 the South African National insignia was added to aircraft for the first time. An Orange, Green, Red and Blue roundel was added to an Avro 504K for trial purposes but the colours were found to be unsuitable and were replaced with a Green, Red, Lemon, Yellow and Blue roundel in December 1921. These colours remained until 1927 when they were replaced with the Orange, White and Blue roundels.

The first operational deployment of the newly formed Air Force was to quell internal dissent, when in 1922 a miner&#x27;s strike on the Johannesburg gold mines turned violent and led to the declaration of martial law. 1 Squadron was called to fly reconnaissance missions and to bombard the strikers&#x27; positions. Sorties in support of the police amounted to 127 flight hours between 10 and 15 March and this inauspicious start for the SAAF led to two pilot losses, two wounded and two aircraft lost to ground fire. The SAAF was again deployed to suppress the Bondelzwart Rebellion at Kalkfontein between 29 May and 3 July 1922.

===Second World War===
 At the outbreak of the Second World War, South Africa had no naval vessels and the UDF&#x27;s first priority was to ensure the safety of the South African coastal waters as well as the strategically important Cape sea-route. For maritime patrol operations, the SAAF took over all 29 passenger aircraft of South African Airways: 18 Junkers Ju 86Z-ls for maritime patrols and eleven Junkers Ju 52s for transport purposes. SAAF maritime patrols commenced on 21 September 1939 with 16 Squadron flying three JU-86Z&#x27;s from Walvis Bay. had been established, eventually consisting of 6, 10, 22, 23, 25, 27 and 29 Squadrons.

By the end of the Second World War in August 1945, SAAF aircraft (in conjunction with British and Dutch aircraft stationed in South Africa) had intercepted 17 enemy ships, assisted in the rescue of 437 survivors of sunken ships, attacked 26 of the 36 enemy submarines that operated around the South African coast, and flown 15,000 coastal patrol sorties.

====East Africa====
In December 1939, The Duke of Aosta had sent a report to Mussolini recording the state of chronic unpreparedness of the Allied Forces in East Africa. The collapse of France in 1940 had prompted Mussolini to join the war on the side of the Axis and as a result, air force elements were moved to forward positions in occupied Ethiopia to mount air attacks on Allied forces before they could be re-inforced. These deployments prompted Allied action and on 13 May 1940, 1 Squadron pilots were sent to Cairo to take delivery of 18 Gloster Gladiators and to fly them south to Kenya, for operations in East Africa. 11 Squadron, equipped with Hawker Hartebeests, followed to Nairobi on 19 May 1940 and were joined by the Junkers Ju 86s of 12 Squadron on 22 May 1940.

The Kingdom of Italy declared war on 10 June 1940 and on the following day, the Ju 86s of 12 Squadron led the first air attack by the SAAF in the Second World War. During the campaign, numerous SAAF aircraft were involved in air combat with the Italian &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; and provided air support to South African and Allied forces in the ground war. By December 1940, ten SAAF squadrons plus 34 Flight, with a total of 94 aircraft, were operational in East Africa (1 Squadron, 2 Squadron, 3 Squadron, 11 Squadron, 12 Squadron, 14 Squadron, 40 Squadron, 41 Squadron, 50 Squadron and 60 Squadron). During this campaign, the SAAF formed a Close Support Flight of four Gladiators and four Hartebeests, with an autonomous air force commander operating with the land forces. This was the precursor of the Desert Air Force/Tactical Air Force &quot;cab-rank&quot; technique which were used extensively for close air support during 1943–1945. The last air combat took place on 29 October and the Italian forces surrendered on 27 November 1941. A reduced SAAF presence was maintained in East Africa for coastal patrols until May 1943.

====Western Desert and North Africa====

SAAF fighter, bomber, and reconnaissance squadrons played a key role in the Western Desert and North African campaigns from 1941 to 1943. One memorable feat was the Boston bombers of 12 and 24 Squadrons dropping hundreds of tons of bombs on Axis forces pushing the Eighth Army back towards Egypt during the &quot;Gazala Gallop&quot; in mid-1942. SAAF bombers continually harassed retreating forces towards the Tunisian border after the Second Battle of El Alamein; the South African fighters of No. 223 Wing RAF helped the Desert Air Force gain air superiority over Axis air forces. Between April 1941 and May 1943, the eleven SAAF squadrons flew 33,991 sorties and destroyed 342 enemy aircraft.
Conditions were however not ideal and pilots and crew were required to operate under critical conditions at times. Pilots were frequently sent home to the Union after gaining experience and did not return for many months, after which conditions in the desert had changed significantly and they were required to regain experience on different aircraft, different tactics and operations from different bases. There were cases where experienced fighter pilots were sent back to the Western Desert as bomber pilots for their second tour – compounding the lack of continuity and experience. The South Africans did however command the respect of their German adversaries.

The South Africans had the distinction of dropping the first and last bombs in the African conflict – the first being on 11 June 1940 on Moyale in Ethiopia and the last being on the Italian 1st Army in Tunisia. The SAAF also produced a number of SAAF Second World War air aces in the process, including John Frost and Marmaduke Pattle.

====Madagascar====
In fear of Japanese occupation and subsequent operations in the Indian Ocean in close proximity to South African sea lanes, Field Marshal Smuts encouraged the preemptive Allied occupation of the island of Madagascar. After much debate and further encouragement by General de Gaulle (who was urging for a Free French operation against Madagascar), Churchill and the Chiefs of Staff agreed to an invasion by means of a strong fleet and adequate air support. In March and April 1942, the SAAF had been conducting reconnaissance flights over Diego-Suarez and 32, 36 and 37 Coastal Flights were withdrawn from South African maritime patrol operations and sent to Lindi on the Indian Ocean coast of Tanzania, with an additional eleven Bristol Beauforts and six Martin Marylands to provide ongoing reconnaissance and close air support for the planned operation – to be known as &quot;Operation Ironclad&quot;.

During the amphibious / air assault carried out by the Royal Navy and Air Force on 5 May, the Vichy French Air Force consisting mainly of Morane fighters and Potez bombers had attacked the Allied fleet but had been neutralised by the Fleet Air Arm aircraft from the two aircraft carriers. Those remaining aircraft not destroyed were withdrawn by the French and flown south to other airfields on the island. Once the main airfield at Arrachart aerodrome in Diego-Suarez had been secured (13 May 1942), the SAAF Air Component flew from Lindi to Arrachart. The air component consisted of thirty-four aircraft (6 Marylands, 11 Beaufort Bombers, 12 Lockheed Lodestars and 6 Ju 52&#x27;s transports). By September 1942, the South African ground forces committed to &quot;Ironclad&quot; had been party to the capturing the southern half of Madagascar as well as the small island of Nossi Be with the SAAF air component supporting these operations. During the campaign which ended with an armistice on 4 November 1942, SAAF aircraft flew a total of 401 sorties with one pilot killed in action, one killed in an accident and one succumbing to disease. Seven aircraft were lost, only one as a result of enemy action.
====Sicilian and Italian campaigns====
By the end of May 1943, the SAAF had two Wings and sixteen squadrons in the Middle East and North Africa with 8,000 men. With the end of the North African campaign, the SAAF role underwent change – becoming more active in fighter bomber, bomber and PR operations as opposed to the fighter role performed in the desert.

Five SAAF squadrons were designated to support the July 1943 invasion of Sicily – 1 Squadron operated combat air patrols over the beaches for the &quot;Operation Husky&quot; landings while 2, 4 and 5 Squadrons provided fighter bomber support during the Sicilian campaign. 30 Squadron (flying as No. 223 Squadron RAF during the campaign) provided light bomber support from Malta and 60 Squadron was responsible for photo reconnaissance flights in support of all Allied forces on the island. After successfully invading the island, a further three squadrons were moved to Sicily and the eight squadrons on the island were tasked with supporting the invasion of Italy: 12 and 24 Squadrons were responsible for medium bomber missions to &quot;soften up&quot; the enemy prior to the invasion while 40 Sqn was responsible for tactical photo-reconnaissance. 1 Squadron provided fighter cover for the 3 September 1943 landings while 2 and 4 Squadrons were responsible for bomber escort.

The South African Air Force participated in the Allied campaigns in the following theaters:

*Italy (1943–45): 2, 3 7 and 8 Wings fought in operations to liberate Italy from German occupation.
*Yugoslavia (1943–44): 7 Wing and 8 Wing supported partisan operations against German occupation forces.
*Balkans (1944–45): Some squadrons served with the Balkan Air Force in operations over Hungary, Romania and Albania.
*Warsaw (1944): 2 Wing air-supplied Warsaw during Warsaw Uprising.
*Greece (1944): 2 Wing supported British operations to liberate Greece and suppress the communist coup.

====Other theatres====


====Mobile Air Force Depot====

The Mobile Air Force Depot (MAFD) was based in Pretoria. Its role during the Second World War was as a location where Air Crew could be stationed, on stand-by, prior to being posted to a more active squadron.

===Berlin airlift===
Post-war, the SAAF also took part in the Berlin airlift of 1948 with 20 aircrews flying Royal Air Force Dakotas. 4,133 tons of supplies were carried in 1,240 missions flown.

===Korean War===

At the outbreak of the Korean War, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution calling for the withdrawal of North Korean forces in South Korea. A request was also made to all UN members for assistance. After a special Cabinet meeting on 20 July 1950 the Union Government announced that due to the long distance between South Africa and Korea, direct ground-based military participation in the conflict was impractical and unrealistic but that a SAAF fighter squadron would be made available to the UN effort. The 50 officers and 157 other ranks of 2 Sqn SAAF sailed from Durban on 26 September 1950 – they had been selected from 1,426 members of the Permanent Force who had initially volunteered for service. This initial contingent was commanded by Cmdt S. van Breda Theron and included many World War II SAAF veterans. The squadron was moved to Johnson Air Base near Tokyo on 25 September 1950 for conversion training on the F-51D Mustangs supplied by the US Air Force.

On completion of conversion training, the squadron was deployed as one of the four USAF 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing squadrons and on 16 November 1950 an advance detachment consisting of 13 officers and 21 other ranks (including the Squadron Commander and his four Flight Commanders who made the crossing in their own F-51D Mustangs) left Japan for Pusan East (K-9) Air Base within the Pusan Perimeter in Korea to fly with the USAF pilots in order to familiarise themselves with the local operational conditions. On the morning of 19 November 1950, Cmdt Theron and Capt G.B. Lipawsky took off with two USAF pilots to fly the first SAAF combat sorties of the Korean War from K-9 and K-24 airfields at Pyongyang.

On 30 November the squadron was moved further south to K-13 airfield due to North Korean and Chinese advances. It was again moved even further south after the UN forces lost additional ground to the North Koreans to K-10 airfield situated on the coast close to the town of Chinhae. This was to be the squadron&#x27;s permanent base for the duration of their first Korean deployment. During this period (while equipped with F-51D Mustangs) the squadron flew 10,373 sorties and lost 74 aircraft out of the total 95 allocated. Twelve pilots were killed in action, 30 missing and four wounded.

In January 1953 the squadron returned to Japan for conversion to the USAF F-86F Sabre fighter-bombers. The first Sabre mission was flown on 16 March 1953 from the K-55 airfield in South Korea, being the first SAAF jet mission flown. 2 squadron was led by ace pilot, Major Jean de Wet from AFB Langebaanweg. The squadron was tasked with fighter sweeps along the Yalu and Chong-Chong rivers as well as close air support attack missions. The squadron flew 2,032 sorties in the Sabres losing four out of the 22 aircraft supplied.

 The war ended on 27 July 1953, when the was signed. During the first phase of the war, the main task of the squadron Mustangs was the interdiction of enemy supply routes which not only accounted for approximately 61.45% of SAAF combat sorties, but which reached an early peak from January to May 1951 (78% and 82%). A typical interdiction mission was an armed reconnaissance patrol usually undertaken by flights of two or four aircraft armed with two napalm bombs, 127 mm rockets and 12.7 mm machine guns. Later, after the introduction of the Sabres, the squadron was also called on to provide counter-air missions flying as fighter sweeps and interceptions against MiG-15&#x27;s, but interdiction and close air support remained the primary mission. Losses were 34 SAAF pilots killed, eight taken prisoner (including the future Chief of the Air Force, General D Earp) with 74 Mustangs and 4 Sabres lost. Pilots and men of the squadron received a total of 797 medals including 2 Silver Stars, the highest US military award given to foreigners, 3 Legions of Merit, 55 Distinguished Flying Crosses and 40 Bronze Stars. In recognition of their association with 2 Squadron, the OC of 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing issued a policy directive &quot;that all retreat ceremonies shall be preceded by the introductory bars of the South African national anthem. All personnel will render the honour to this anthem as our own.&quot;

On conclusion of hostilities, the Sabres were returned to the USAF and the squadron returned to South Africa in October 1953. During this period, the Union Defence Forces were reorganised into individual services and the SAAF became an arm of service in its own right, under an Air Chief of Staff (who was renamed &quot;Chief of the Air Force&quot; in 1966). It adopted a blue uniform, to replace the army khaki it had previously worn.

===Rhodesian Bush War===
The SAAF loaned aircraft and flew occasional covert reconnaissance, transport and combat sorties in support of the Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF; renamed in 1970 as the Rhodesian Air Force (RhAF)) and the rest of the Rhodesian Security Forces from 1966 onwards. Notable operations included Operation Uric and Operation Vanity in 1979.

===Border War===

From 1966 to 1989, the SAAF was committed to the Border War, which was fought in northern South West Africa and surrounding states. At first, it provided limited air support to police operations against the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia (the military wing of SWAPO, which was fighting to end South African rule of South West Africa). Operations intensified after the defence force took charge of the war in 1974. 
In July 1964, South Africa placed a development contract with Thomson-CSF for a mobile, all-weather, low-altitude SAM system after a South African order for the Bloodhound SAM system was refused by the UK government. This became the Crotale, or &#x27;Cactus&#x27; in South African service. The South African government paid 85 per cent of the development costs of the system with the balance being paid for by France. The system was in service with 120 Squadron SAAF from 1970 until the late 1980s without any successful combat shootdowns.

The SAAF provided air support to the army during the 1975–76 Angola campaign, and in the many cross-border operations that were carried out against PLAN bases in Angola and Zambia from 1977 onwards.

During the bush war period, South Africa manufactured six air-deliverable tactical nuclear weapons of the &quot;gun-type&quot; design between 1978 and 1993. Each of the devices contained 55 kilograms of HEU with an estimated yield of 10–18 kilotons designed for delivery by Blackburn Buccaneer or English Electric Canberra aircraft. See History of the South African Air Force#Nuclear and ballistic weapons.

At least two MIG-21s of the Angolan Air Force were shot down by 3 Squadron SAAF Mirage F1s in 1981 and 1982.

From 1980 to 1984, the command structure was reorganised. Instead of units of the separate Strike Command, Transportation Command SAAF, and Maritime Air Command SAAF often being based at the same base but responsible to different chains of command, regional commands were established. Main Threat Air Command (MTAC) was made responsible for the northern half of the country, and Southern Air Command SAAF and Western Air Command SAAF for those areas. MTAC was co-located with the Air Force Command Post at Pretoria, with 20 subordinate squadrons (8 reserve). Southern Air Command at Silvermine was allocated nine squadrons (three reserve), based at AFS Port Elizabeth, Cape Town Airport, and AFB Ysterplaat, including 16 Squadron SAAF (Alouettes), 25 Squadron flying Dakotas from Ysterplaat, 27 Squadron SAAF (Piaggio 166), 35 Squadron SAAF (Avro Shackleton), and 88 Maritime Training School. Western Air Command at Windhoek relied on aircraft temporarily detached from MTAC and SAC. Airspace Control Command, Training Command and Air Logistics Command remained largely unchanged.
The SAAF was also heavily involved in the 1987–88 Angola campaign, before the New York Accords that ended the conflict. The international arms embargo imposed against the then-apartheid government of South Africa, meant that the SAAF was unable to procure modern fighter aircraft to compete with the sophisticated Soviet-supplied air defence network and Cuban Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23s fielded in the latter part of this conflict. South Africa was able to secure the transfer of technology from Israel through the Israel–South Africa Agreement, thereby allowing the Cheetah derivative of the IAI Kfir to be produced.

From 1990 with the perceived reduction in threat, SAAF operational strength began to be reduced. The first short term steps entailed the withdrawal of several obsolete aircraft types from service, such as the Canberra B(1)12, the Super Frelon and Westland Wasp helicopters, the Kudu light aircraft and the P-166s Albatross coastal patrol aircraft. Other initial measures included the downgrading of Air Force Base Port Elizabeth and the disbanding of 12, 16, 24, 25, and 27 Squadrons. Two Commando squadrons – 103 Squadron SAAF at AFB Bloemspruit and 114 Squadron SAAF at AFB Swartkop – were also disbanded.

====Air Defence Artillery Group====
The 250 Air Defence Artillery Group, also known as the 250 Air Defence Unit (ADU), was a group of air defence squadrons that operated under the control of the South African Air Force tasked with airbase defence. The group consisted of 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129 and 130 Squadrons and had its own active Citizen Force component. These squadrons were equipped with the Tigercat mobile surface-to-air missile system, The Cactus surface-to-air missile system, the ZU-23-2 23mm Anti-Aircraft Gun and the Bofors 40 mm gun.

120 Squadron mainly operated the Cactus missile system operationally in platoons from 1973 until the late 1980s with each platoon consisting of one Acquisition and Co-ordination Unit (ACU) and two or three firing units, with a battery having two platoons. 121 Squadron, 123 Squadron and later 129 Squadron mainly operated the Tigercat mobile surface-to-air missile system. In South African service it was given the name &quot;Hilda&quot;. 123 Squadron was deployed for Operation Savannah in 1975 to provide air defence for Air Force Base Grootfontein in South-West Africa. 129 Squadron was deployed to Air Force Base Ondangwa for the remainder of the Border War to provide air defence for the logistics base and airfield there, as it was an important staging area for the South African Defence Force for their operations in neighbouring Angola.

The Air Defence Artillery Group was disbanded in 1992 after the Cactus missile system was retired, with only remnants of 120 Squadron, operating the upgraded Cactus Container system, becoming a part of Air Command Control Unit at Snake Valley opposite Air Force Base Swartkop on the eastern side of the shared runway. 120 Squadron was finally disbanded in 2002 after these systems were retired.

====Major operations====
During the bush war, the SAAF lost a total of 22 aircraft (1974–1989) to enemy action. A further 11 aircraft were lost in the operational area due to pilot error or malfunction.

===Since 1994===
After the first South African multi-racial elections in 1994, the SAAF became part of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). The South African Air Force is currently considered to be the most effective air force in sub-Sahara Africa despite the loss of capability as a consequence of defence cuts after the end of the Border War.

These financial cuts have brought about a number of severe operational limitations, compounded by the loss of experienced air-crews. This has placed strain on the bringing new types of aircraft into service, specifically the Gripen, Hawk, Rooivalk, A 109 and Lynx. The cancellation of the SAAF participation and procurement of the A400M in November 2009 has denied the SAAF the strategic airlift capability needed for domestic, regional and continent-wide transport operations. There is no clear indication as yet regarding how the heavy/long-range airlift gap will be addressed.

Current air combat capabilities are limited to the Gripen multi-role fighter and the Rooivalk combat support helicopter although in insufficient number to allow regional deployments while maintaining national air security and current training commitments. To overcome this shortfall, the SAAF has designated the Hawk Mk 120 trainers for additional tactical reconnaissance and weapon delivery platforms for targets designated by the Gripens. Financial constraints have further limited flying hours on the newly acquired aircraft; it was planned to keep Gripen pilots current flying the lower cost Hawk aircraft with &quot;Gripenised&quot; cockpits. It was reported in 2013 that the Gripen fleet wasn&#x27;t fully manned with some pilots redesignated as reserve pilots and others being assigned instructor roles at Air Force Base Makhado. The SAAF stated that the Gripen fleet is being rotated between short-term storage and active use by the regular active pilots to spread the limited flying hours among the whole fleet. 
During this same period it was reported that 18 of the SAAF&#x27;s AgustaWestland AW109 helicopters have been grounded due to an accident involving one of the helicopters several months prior and a lack of funds for regular maintenance, however in November 2013 after five months of not flying, the grounding of the helicopters was lifted after more funds became available.
Despite all its setbacks and financial woes, the South African Air Force continues to undertake and complete the tasks and obligations assigned to it. The SAAF still plays a vital role in national security operations, United Nations peacekeeping missions, and other foreign deployments. the Air force has several aircraft, aircrew and ground crew on foreign deployments. Three Rooivalk attack helicopters from 16 Squadron SAAF and five or six 15, 17, 19 and/or 22 Squadron SAAF&#x27;s Oryx transport helicopters were stationed in Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as part of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). The Rooivalk and Oryx Helicopters are part of the South African contribution to the 3000-strong United Nations Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) and they have flown several sorties against rebel factions who are operating in North Kivu province, particularly the notorious M23 militia group who were routed from their strongholds after an offensive by the UN Force Intervention Brigade and the Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Several 28 Squadron SAAF C-130BZ Hercules aircraft also regularly flew to Sudan, DR Congo and Uganda, including Lubumbashi, Kinshasa, Goma, Beni, Bunia and Entebbe, as Entebbe is the logistic hub for MONUSCO in the eastern DR Congo. They mainly fly missions ranging from logistic support for SA National Defence Force continental peacekeeping and peace support operations, humanitarian operations, support to the South African Army, and general airlift. A C-47TP Turbo Dakota from 35 Squadron SAAF permanently based in the Mozambican city of Pemba to provide maritime patrol capability for the Southern African Development Community (SADC) counter-piracy mission in the Mozambique Channel, Operation Copper. There is also a Super Lynx from 22 Squadron SAAF operating from the South African Navy frigates whenever they are stationed in the Mozambican channel. The air force also assists Operation Corona from &quot;time to time&quot; by deploying either AgustaWestland AW109 or Atlas Oryx helicopters to its borders.

During the 2010 FIFA World Cup the South African National Defence Force was deployed in order to provide security for the event. The air force deployed armed Gripen Fighter aircraft and Hawk advanced trainer aircraft to conduct air patrols to monitor air traffic. Rooivalk, Atlas Oryx and AgustaWestland AW109 helicopters were also deployed during the event.

It was also reported by the Afrikaans daily newspaper, &quot;Beeld&quot;, that on 23 March 2013 when the Séléka rebel group attempted to take power in the Central African Republic by invading the capital of Bangui, four armed Gripen Fighter aircraft from 2 Squadron SAAF were sent along with a C-130BZ transport aircraft (reportedly carrying a stock of bombs) in order to provide close air support to the 200-strong South African garrison who were still fighting in the city. The aircraft were, however, recalled shortly after, as the South Africans and the rebels agreed to a ceasefire and rather opted to withdraw peacefully from the country. Several flights made by C-130BZ aircraft evacuated the bodies of the 13 South African soldiers who were killed and the 27 who were wounded during the Séléka offensive and also the remainder of the deployed soldiers and their equipment after the ceasefire was declared. The deployment of the Gripen fighter aircraft indicated that if the situation called for it, the country will deploy its fighter aircraft in order to ensure the protection of its assets.

The air force was also tasked with maintaining national security before and during the funeral procession of former president Nelson Mandela in December 2013. Several SAAF helicopters conducted patrols over Pretoria while the former president&#x27;s body was lying in state in the days leading up to the funeral. Gripen fighter aircraft, armed with IRIS-T missiles and Digital Joint Reconnaissance Pods, conducted combat air patrols to enforce a no-fly zone for several days over certain areas in Gauteng province and later during the funeral itself over Qunu, in the Eastern Cape. Two Gripens were also tasked with escorting a C-130BZ aircraft, which was carrying President Mandela&#x27;s body from Air Force Base Waterkloof to the Mthatha Airport. Five Gripens, three Oryx helicopters and the 6 Pilatus PC-7&#x27;s of the Silver Falcons performed a flypast in a final salute to the late former president.
On 12 September 2014, a church hostel collapsed within the compound of the Synagogue, Church of All Nations in Lagos, Nigeria. More than 100 persons died in the collapse, among them 85 South Africans. President Jacob Zuma ordered the South African Air Force to assist with the repatriation of survivors and victims, and the first 25 survivors were flown to South Africa in a specially adapted SAAF Hercules C-130 on 22 September 2014. Due to a lack of airlift capacity, an Antonov aircraft from Maximus Aero was chartered in order to repatriate the bodies of 74 victims, which arrived on 15 November 2014. The last 11 bodies were finally repatriated using an SAAF C-130 on 6 February 2015. The delay in repatriating the last bodies was due to authorities having to wait for DNA test results in order to positively identify the remaining victims.

In spite of its budget concerns, the air force still continues to participate in and support annual air and defence shows and capability demonstrations such as the Rand show, the Zwartkops airshow and the Africa Aerospace and Defence Expo.

In 2002 Musa Mbhokota became the SAAF&#x27;s first black jet fighter pilot. In March 2017 Nandi Zama became for first black woman in SAAF history to command and fly a Hercules C-130 cargo plane.

As of 2021, Department of Defence officials informed Parliament that a reduced availability of aircraft was negatively affecting hours flown. Helicopter systems were said to have &quot;a critical spares shortage&quot; with similar problems also confronting the transport and combat aircraft and systems. The parliamentary Defence and Military Veterans (PCDMV) committee was told that &quot;Constrained funding is also affecting the ability to provide enough serviceable aircraft, although serious efforts are being made to ensure availability is increased within the reduced budget&quot;. During the first quarter of the 2021/22 financial year, the air force flew 3,560.8 hours, including 2,717 Force Preparation hours, 636.7 Force Employment hours; and 207.1 VIP flying hours. As of late 2021, all the Air Force&#x27;s Gripen fighter aircraft were grounded. However, in 2022 the Air Force concluded a deal with Saab to return 13 of the aircraft to service over a three-year period.

In 2002 the Air Force rank insignia were changed from one which was shared with the Army to a new pattern based on stripes. The Air Force stated that this was &quot;in order to bring it more in line with international forms of rank&quot;. The General ranks initially had a thick stripe (thicker than the Senior Officer rank stripe) with thin stripes above, but this was changed shortly after implementation to the crossed sword and baton insignia typical of Commonwealth Generals. The reason for the change so soon after implementation of the new insignia was presumed to be confusion in differentiating between Generals and Senior Officers.

Note: The Rank of Master Chief Warrant Officer is only used when the Sergeant Major of the Air Force is also the Sergeant Major of the Defence Force.

===Air Force Mobile Deployment Wing===

The Air Force Mobile Deployment Wing (AFMDW) provides combat ready, integrated and deployable air support capabilities to the South African National Defence Force. The AFMDW consists of 18 Deployment Support Unit, Mobile Communications Unit, 140 Squadron and 142 Squadron, 500 Squadron and 501 Squadron.

===Reserves===
The Air Force Conventional Reserves are a pool of reserve posts created to serve the SAAF and augment regular units as and when needed. All trades in the SAAF are represented in the reserves, e.g. pilots, security squadron personnel etc.
The Air Force Territorial Reserve currently consists of nine squadrons of privately owned aircraft operated by reserve pilots on behalf of the SAAF who assist in light transport and observation roles.

==Other establishments and units==

===Air Force Memorial===

The South African Air Force Memorial is a memorial to South African Air Force members who have died whilst in service of the South African Air Corps and the South African Air Force from 1915 to the present. The memorial is located at Swartkop outside Pretoria.

===Air Force Museum===

The South African Air Force Museum houses, exhibits and restores material related to the history of the South African Air Force. It is spread across three locations; AFB Swartkop outside Pretoria, AFB Ysterplaat in Cape Town and at the Port Elizabeth airport. Swartkop is the largest of the three museum locations, occupying at least five hangars and contains a number of Atlas Cheetahs as well as a Cheetah C flight simulator.

===Silver Falcons===

The Silver Falcons are the aerobatic display team of the South African Air Force and are based at Air Force Base Langebaanweg near Cape Town. The Silver Falcons fly the Pilatus PC-7 Mk II Astra, the basic trainer of the SA Air Force in a 5-ship routine. The main purpose is to enhance the image of the South African Air Force, encourage recruitment and instill national pride through public display.

=== Radar coverage ===
The South African Air Force operates several radar systems within the country&#x27;s borders and can deploy radar systems internationally to support external South African operations such as during UN peacekeeping operations. The Air Force&#x27;s radar equipment is also supplemented by radar equipment and data from the other branches of the South African National Defence Force, the South African Weather Service and several civilian airport radars who cooperate with the Air Force to monitor air traffic.

Each air force base is equipped with air field radar approach systems (AFRAS) that monitors air traffic within the airfield&#x27;s operational sector 24 hours per day. These systems include primary approach radars, precision approach radars, and secondary surveillance radar and display systems. These systems have a range of more than 120 km. The AFRAS are maintained by Saab Grintek as well as Tellumat. Air Force Base Overberg in the Western Cape is also equipped with a Doppler tracking radar and is used primarily by the Test Flight and Development Centre SAAF and the Denel Overberg Test Range for aircraft and missile development tests. In the Western Cape there is a radar station at Kapteinskop, jointly used by Air Force Base Langebaanweg and Cape Town International Airport to monitor air traffic. Air Force Base Makhado has another radar station located in the mountains to the north of the main base complex apart from its AFRAS radar (located in the main base itself).

The Air Force maintains six Umlindi (Zulu: &quot;Watchman&quot;) AR3D long-range early warning radar systems (British AR3D radar systems extensively upgraded by the South African company, Tellumat) which are operated by 140 Squadron SAAF as part of the South African Air Force Mobile Deployment Wing. There are two static radar stations located in Lephalale (Ellisras) and Mariepskop, near Air Force Base Hoedspruit. The other systems are mobile and can be deployed to any part of the country to support operations with the use of 20-ton 8x8 MAN trucks. Each of these systems has a range of 500 km but can only track aircraft flying above 700 metres. The static radars are usually linked to two Air Force sector control centres (SCC), the Lowveld Airspace Control Sector and the Bushveld Airspace Control Sector, while the mobile radar have their own mobile sector control centres (MSCC).

To mitigate this lack of low-level radar coverage, the Air Force also operates four Plessey Tactical Mobile Radar (TMR) systems (in service with 142 Squadron SAAF). These systems can cover altitudes below 700 metres, but they have a shorter range than the Umlindi systems, at 150 km. The deployment of these systems require the use of a MAN 8×8 truck (one per system), one or two light vehicles for command and control purposes, a water tanker, a diesel bowser and a technical workshop vehicle. These systems can operate 24 hours a day with less than 20 personnel (including personnel from other AFMDW units like the Mobile Communications Unit and 501 Squadron).

The South African Air Force&#x27;s Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft are also equipped with PS-05/A pulse-doppler X-band multi-mode radar, developed by Ericsson and GEC-Marconi. This all-weather radar system is capable of locating and identifying air targets 120 km away and surface targets 70 km away. It is also able to automatically track multiple targets in the upper and lower spheres, on the ground and sea or in the air. It can guide several beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to multiple targets simultaneously (although the Air Force still lacks modern beyond visual range missile capability). When deployed operationally on combat missions and air patrols the aircraft can link their systems to the South African National Defence Force&#x27;s digital network protocol, Link-ZA, to share data with other radar systems to help create a wider picture as to the situation in the air and on the ground in order to rapidly adapt to a change in short term situations.

Other branches of the South African National Defence Force also operate several radar systems that can assist the South African Air Force. The South African Navy uses four Valour-class frigates, each of which is equipped with the Thales Naval France MRR-3D NG G-band multi-role surveillance/self-defence radar that can detect low and medium-level targets at ranges of up to 140 km and in long-range 3D air surveillance mode targets up to 180 km. In the self-defence mode, it can detect and track any threat within a radius of 60 km. These Frigates can link their data systems to the Link-ZA system to help create a broader picture for the armed forces. The South African Army also operates several Reutech Radar Systems (RRS) ESR220 Thutlhwa (Kameelperd/Giraffe) Mobile Battery Fire Control Post Systems. These NATO D-Band radars have a range of 120 km and can also be linked to Link-ZA to assist air force operations.

Civilian airport radars in all nine provinces as well as the network of South African Weather Service radars can also share their radar data with the South African Air Force. According to the South African Weather Service, the South African Air Force has access to raw data from their ten long range fixed system Doppler (S-Band) and two short range mobile (X-Band) meteorological radars, and the interpreted information can be used for aviation and defence purposes.

==Training areas==

===Ditholo Training Area===
Situated 66 km north of Pretoria, Ditholo Training Area used to house Air Defence Artillery Group until 1992. The 3300 hectare property is used primarily for gravel runway training, radar tracking, and aerial cargo drop exercises such as LAPES. Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES) is a tactical military airlift delivery method where a fixed wing cargo aircraft can deposit supplies when landing is not an option in an area that is too small to accurately parachute supplies from a high altitude.

Other training include: Search and rescue exercises, basic training, VIP protection, candidate officer training, task force training and escape and evasion training.

Due to its unique ecology, Ditholo is also a registered nature reserve, being one of the few remaining portions of Kalahari plains thornveld in existence. As of 2013, Ditholo is run jointly with the Gauteng Provincial Government as part of the Dinokeng Biosphere Reserve. As of 24 May 2014 it houses more than 340 species of birds and large mammal species such as giraffe, lion, zebra, tsessebe, blue wildebeest, kudu and waterbuck.

===The Roodewal Weapons Range===
Situated in the Limpopo Province, roughly halfway between Polokwane (previously Pietersburg) and AFB Makhado, near the town of Louis Trichardt. This property is used for air superiority training. Buffering the range is the Corbadraai Nature Reserve.

===Temporary Air Base Upington===
Activated only for large scale exercises in the Northern Cape.

===Dragons Peak Drakensberg===
In 1985 a satellite base at Dragons Peak, in the Drakensberg was established in order to conduct helicopter mountain flying training.

===Vastrap===
Vastrap (Afrikaans: &quot;stand firm&quot;) is a small military airfield situated in the Kalahari Desert north east of Upington inside a 700 square kilometre weapons test range of the same name[1] belonging to the South African National Defence Force. It was constructed to allow the SAAF to practice tactical bombing operations, and for aircraft to service the ARMSCOR&#x27;s defunct underground nuclear weapon test site.

===Environmental management===
 
The SAAF&#x27;s training areas and bases are home to many species of fauna and flora as well as, in some instances, buildings and other structures of historical and cultural value. The Environmental Services sub-department in the SANDF Logistics Division has the overall task of ensuring proper environmental practices are in place not only on training grounds but also at bases.

The following specific management is practiced:

* Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) aims to enhance long term, effective training by implementing management practices for land and aerial ranges to ensure their continued use and minimised environmental damage.
* Base Environmental Management (BEM) system proper management of buildings, responsible water and energy use, integrated waste management as well as ensuring cultural and historical resources are properly maintained.
* Environment for Operations (ECOps) aims to ensure adverse effects of military activities on the general environment are avoided or mitigated throughout any specific operations.

<doc id="480286" wikidata="Q683682" url="?curid=480286" title="Bulgogi">
<text>Bulgogi ( , , ; , ) is a &quot;gui&quot; (Korean-style grilled or roasted dish) made of thin, marinated slices of meat, most commonly beef, grilled on a barbecue or on a stove-top griddle. It is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. Sirloin and rib eye are frequently used cuts of beef for the dish. Bulgogi is a very popular dish in South Korea, where it can be found anywhere from upscale restaurants to local supermarkets as pan-ready kits.

== Etymology ==
 came from the Korean word &quot;bul-gogi&quot; (), consisting of &quot;bul&quot; (&quot;fire&quot;) and &quot;gogi&quot; (&quot;meat&quot;). The compound word is derived from the Pyongan dialect, as the dish itself is a delicacy of Pyongan Province, North Korea. The dish became popular in Seoul and other parts of South Korea, introduced by refugees from Pyongan. It was listed in the 1947 edition of the &quot;Dictionary of the Korean Language&quot; as meat grilled directly over a charcoal fire.

In the &quot;Standard Korean Language Dictionary&quot; published by the National Institute of Korean Language, the word is listed as meat, such as beef that is thinly sliced, marinated, and grilled over the fire. The word is also included in English-language dictionaries such as the &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot;. Merriam-Webster dated the word&#x27;s appearance in the American English lexicon in 1961.

== History ==
 is believed to have originated during the Goguryeo era (37 BCE–668 CE), when it was originally called &quot;maekjeok&quot; (), with the beef being grilled on a skewer. It was called &quot;neobiani&quot; (), meaning &quot;thinly spread&quot; meat, during the Joseon period and was traditionally prepared especially for the wealthy and the nobility. In the medieval Korean history book &quot;Dongguksesi&quot; (), is recorded under the name &quot;yeomjeok&quot; (), which means &quot;fire meat.&quot; It was grilled barbecue-style on a &quot;hwaro&quot; grill on skewers, in pieces approximately 0.5 cm thick. Although it is no longer cooked skewered, this original type of is today called &quot;bulgogi sanjeok&quot; ().

== Preparation and serving ==


Bulgogi is made from thin slices of sirloin or other prime cuts of beef. Ribeye is also commonly used due to its tenderness and easily cuttable texture. In addition to beef, chicken and pork bulgogi are also common ingredients used to prepare the dish. Pork belly, or samgyeopsal in Korean, is a popular cut for pork bulgogi. Much like the ribeye, it is tender and fatty which can give the meat a better taste. Before cooking, the meat is marinated to enhance its flavor and tenderness with a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ground black pepper, and other ingredients such as scallions, ginger, onions or mushrooms, especially white button mushrooms or &quot;matsutake&quot;. In most cases when cooking bulgogi, these are common ingredients. However, the ingredients used to marinate the meat can vary from chef to chef and even from family to family depending on one&#x27;s preferences and traditions. Pureed pears, pineapple, kiwi, and onions are often used as tenderizers. Sugar or other types of sweeteners such as corn syrup may sometimes also be used to add a sweeter taste. The length of time in which the meat is left to marinate also varies depending on preferences. Generally, bulgogi meat is left to marinate for less than an hour. Sometimes, cellophane noodles are added to the dish, which varies by the region and specific recipe.

The most common way of preparing beef bulgogi produces a dark-looking texture that is well seasoned and flavored. Spicy variations are also common where a spicy paste such as gochujang, made from chili powder, rice, fermented soybeans, barley, and salt, is added to the marinade to make the meat spicy. This is most commonly done with the pork variations.

Bulgogi is traditionally grilled, but pan-cooking has become popular as well. Whole cloves of garlic, sliced onions and chopped green peppers are often grilled or fried with the meat. Bulgogi is often served over or with a side of rice and accompanied by various side dishes such as egg soup and kimchi (fermented cabbage). This dish is sometimes served with a side of lettuce or other leafy vegetable, which is used to wrap a slice of cooked meat, often along with a dab of &quot;ssamjang&quot;, rice, or other side dishes, and then eaten together.

In many Korean barbecue restaurants, customers are seated at a table that will have a grill installed in the middle. Raw and marinated bulgogi is one of many popular types that customers can order and cook themselves right on the table. It is common for each person to pick at the meat directly from the grill or serve each other when eating. Bulgogi is eaten any time of the year; however, it is common for people in Korea to enjoy grilling the marinated meat on special occasions or in social settings.

== In popular culture ==
Bulgogi is served in barbecue restaurants in Korea, and there are bulgogi-flavored fast-food hamburgers sold at many South Korean fast-food restaurants. The hamburger patty is marinated in bulgogi sauce and served with lettuce, tomato, onion, and sometimes cheese.

<text>Collaborative filtering (CF) is, besides content-based filtering, one of two major techniques used by recommender systems. Collaborative filtering has two senses, a narrow one and a more general one.

In the newer, narrower sense, collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about a user&#x27;s interests by utilizing preferences or taste information collected from many users (collaborating). This approach assumes that if persons &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; share similar opinions on one issue, they are more likely to agree on other issues compared to a random pairing of &quot;A&quot; with another person. For instance, a collaborative filtering system for television programming could predict which shows a user might enjoy based on a limited list of the user&#x27;s tastes (likes or dislikes). These predictions are specific to the user, but use information gleaned from many users. This differs from the simpler approach of giving an average (non-specific) score for each item of interest, for example based on its number of votes.

In the more general sense, collaborative filtering is the process of filtering information or patterns using techniques involving collaboration among multiple agents, viewpoints, data sources, etc. Applications of collaborative filtering typically involve very large data sets. Collaborative filtering methods have been applied to many kinds of data including: sensing and monitoring data, such as in mineral exploration, environmental sensing over large areas or multiple sensors; financial data, such as financial service institutions that integrate many financial sources; and user data from electronic commerce and web applications. 

This article focuses on collaborative filtering for user data, but some of the methods also apply to other major applications.

==Overview==
The growth of the Internet has made it much more difficult to effectively extract useful information from all the available online information. The overwhelming amount of data necessitates mechanisms for efficient information filtering. Collaborative filtering is one of the techniques used for dealing with this problem.

The motivation for collaborative filtering comes from the idea that people often get the best recommendations from someone with tastes similar to themselves. Collaborative filtering encompasses techniques for matching people with similar interests and making recommendations on this basis.

Collaborative filtering algorithms often require (1) users&#x27; active participation, (2) an easy way to represent users&#x27; interests, and (3) algorithms that are able to match people with similar interests.

Typically, the workflow of a collaborative filtering system is:
# A user expresses his or her preferences by rating items (e.g. books, movies, or music recordings) of the system. These ratings can be viewed as an approximate representation of the user&#x27;s interest in the corresponding domain.
# The system matches this user&#x27;s ratings against other users&#x27; and finds the people with most &quot;similar&quot; tastes.
# With similar users, the system recommends items that the similar users have rated highly but not yet being rated by this user (presumably the absence of rating is often considered as the unfamiliarity of an item)
A key problem of collaborative filtering is how to combine and weight the preferences of user neighbors. Sometimes, users can immediately rate the recommended items. As a result, the system gains an increasingly accurate representation of user preferences over time.

==Methodology==

Collaborative filtering systems have many forms, but many common systems can be reduced to two steps:
# Look for users who share the same rating patterns with the active user (the user whom the prediction is for).
# Use the ratings from those like-minded users found in step 1 to calculate a prediction for the active user
This falls under the category of user-based collaborative filtering. A specific application of this is the user-based Nearest Neighbor algorithm.

Alternatively, item-based collaborative filtering (users who bought x also bought y), proceeds in an item-centric manner:
# Build an item-item matrix determining relationships between pairs of items
# Infer the tastes of the current user by examining the matrix and matching that user&#x27;s data
See, for example, the Slope One item-based collaborative filtering family.

Another form of collaborative filtering can be based on implicit observations of normal user behavior (as opposed to the artificial behavior imposed by a rating task). These systems observe what a user has done together with what all users have done (what music they have listened to, what items they have bought) and use that data to predict the user&#x27;s behavior in the future, or to predict how a user might like to behave given the chance. These predictions then have to be filtered through business logic to determine how they might affect the actions of a business system. For example, it is not useful to offer to sell somebody a particular album of music if they already have demonstrated that they own that music.

Relying on a scoring or rating system which is averaged across all users ignores specific demands of a user, and is particularly poor in tasks where there is large variation in interest (as in the recommendation of music). However, there are other methods to combat information explosion, such as web search and data clustering.

==Types==

===Memory-based===
The memory-based approach uses user rating data to compute the similarity between users or items. Typical examples of this approach are neighbourhood-based CF and item-based/user-based top-N recommendations. For example, in user based approaches, the value of ratings user &quot;u&quot; gives to item &quot;i&quot; is calculated as an aggregation of some similar users&#x27; rating of the item:
:formula_1

where &quot;U&quot; denotes the set of top &quot;N&quot; users that are most similar to user &quot;u&quot; who rated item &quot;i&quot;. Some examples of the aggregation function include:
:formula_2
:formula_3
where k is a normalizing factor defined as formula_4, and
:formula_5
where formula_6 is the average rating of user &quot;u&quot; for all the items rated by &quot;u&quot;.

The neighborhood-based algorithm calculates the similarity between two users or items, and produces a prediction for the user by taking the weighted average of all the ratings. Similarity computation between items or users is an important part of this approach. Multiple measures, such as Pearson correlation and vector cosine based similarity are used for this.

The Pearson correlation similarity of two users &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; is defined as 
:formula_7

where Ixy is the set of items rated by both user &quot;x&quot; and user &quot;y&quot;.

The cosine-based approach defines the cosine-similarity between two users &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; as:
:formula_8

The user based top-N recommendation algorithm uses a similarity-based vector model to identify the &quot;k&quot; most similar users to an active user. After the &quot;k&quot; most similar users are found, their corresponding user-item matrices are aggregated to identify the set of items to be recommended. A popular method to find the similar users is the Locality-sensitive hashing, which implements the nearest neighbor mechanism in linear time.

The advantages with this approach include: the explainability of the results, which is an important aspect of recommendation systems; easy creation and use; easy facilitation of new data; content-independence of the items being recommended; good scaling with co-rated items.

There are also several disadvantages of this approach. Its performance decreases when data is sparse, which is common for web-related items. This hinders the scalability of this approach and creates problems with large datasets. Although it can efficiently handle new users because it relies on a data structure, adding new items becomes more complicated because that representation usually relies on a specific vector space. Adding new items requires inclusion of the new item and the re-insertion of all the elements in the structure.

===Model-based===
An alternative to memory-based methods is to learn models to predict users&#x27; rating of unrated items. Model-based CF algorithms include Bayesian networks, clustering models, latent semantic models such as singular value decomposition, probabilistic latent semantic analysis, multiple multiplicative factor, latent Dirichlet allocation and Markov decision process-based models.

Through this approach, dimensionality reduction methods are mostly used for improving robustness and accuracy of memory-based methods. Specifically, methods like singular value decomposition, principal component analysis, known as latent factor models, compress a user-item matrix into a low-dimensional representation in terms of latent factors. This transforms the large matrix that contains many missing values, into a much smaller matrix. A compressed matrix can be used to find neighbors of a user or item as per the previous section. Compression has two advantages in large, sparse data: it is more accurate and scales better.

===Hybrid===
A number of applications combine the memory-based and the model-based CF algorithms. These overcome the limitations of native CF approaches and improve prediction performance. Importantly, they overcome the CF problems such as sparsity and loss of information. However, they have increased complexity and are expensive to implement. Usually most commercial recommender systems are hybrid, for example, the Google news recommender system.

===Deep-learning===
In recent years, many neural and deep-learning techniques have been proposed for collaborative filtering. Some generalize traditional matrix factorization algorithms via a non-linear neural architecture, or leverage new model types like Variational Autoencoders. Deep learning has been applied to many scenarios (context-aware, sequence-aware, social tagging etc.).

However, deep learning effectiveness for collaborative recommendation has been questioned. A systematic analysis of publications using deep learning or neural methods to the top-k recommendation problem, published in top conferences (SIGIR, KDD, WWW, RecSys), found that, on average, less than 40% of articles are reproducible, and only 14% in some conferences. Overall, the study identifies 18 articles, only 7 of them could be reproduced and 6 could be outperformed by older and simpler properly tuned baselines. The article highlights potential problems in today&#x27;s research scholarship and calls for improved scientific practices. Similar issues have been spotted by others and also in sequence-aware recommender systems.

== Context-aware collaborative filtering ==
Many recommender systems simply ignore other contextual information existing alongside user&#x27;s rating in providing item recommendation. However, by pervasive availability of contextual information such as time, location, social information, and type of the device that user is using, it is becoming more important than ever for a successful recommender system to provide a context-sensitive recommendation. According to Charu Aggrawal, &quot;Context-sensitive recommender systems tailor their recommendations to additional information that defines the specific situation under which recommendations are made. This additional information is referred to as the context.&quot;

Taking contextual information into consideration, we will have additional dimension to the existing user-item rating matrix. As an instance, assume a music recommender system which provides different recommendations in corresponding to time of the day. In this case, it is possible a user have different preferences for a music in different time of a day. Thus, instead of using user-item matrix, we may use tensor of order 3 (or higher for considering other contexts) to represent context-sensitive users&#x27; preferences.

In order to take advantage of collaborative filtering and particularly neighborhood-based methods, approaches can be extended from a two-dimensional rating matrix into a tensor of higher order. For this purpose, the approach is to find the most similar/like-minded users to a target user; one can extract and compute similarity of slices (e.g. item-time matrix) corresponding to each user. Unlike the context-insensitive case for which similarity of two rating vectors are calculated, in the context-aware approaches, the similarity of rating matrices corresponding to each user is calculated by using Pearson coefficients. After the most like-minded users are found, their corresponding ratings are aggregated to identify the set of items to be recommended to the target user.

The most important disadvantage of taking context into recommendation model is to be able to deal with larger dataset that contains much more missing values in comparison to user-item rating matrix. Therefore, similar to matrix factorization methods, tensor factorization techniques can be used to reduce dimensionality of original data before using any neighborhood-based methods.

==Application on social web==
Unlike the traditional model of mainstream media, in which there are few editors who set guidelines, collaboratively filtered social media can have a very large number of editors, and content improves as the number of participants increases. Services like Reddit, YouTube, and Last.fm are typical examples of collaborative filtering based media.

One scenario of collaborative filtering application is to recommend interesting or popular information as judged by the community. As a typical example, stories appear in the front page of Reddit as they are &quot;voted up&quot; (rated positively) by the community. As the community becomes larger and more diverse, the promoted stories can better reflect the average interest of the community members.

Wikipedia is another application of collaborative filtering. Volunteers contribute to the encyclopedia by filtering out facts from falsehoods.

Another aspect of collaborative filtering systems is the ability to generate more personalized recommendations by analyzing information from the past activity of a specific user, or the history of other users deemed to be of similar taste to a given user. These resources are used as user profiling and helps the site recommend content on a user-by-user basis. The more a given user makes use of the system, the better the recommendations become, as the system gains data to improve its model of that user.

===Problems===
A collaborative filtering system does not necessarily succeed in automatically matching content to one&#x27;s preferences. Unless the platform achieves unusually good diversity and independence of opinions, one point of view will always dominate another in a particular community. As in the personalized recommendation scenario, the introduction of new users or new items can cause the cold start problem, as there will be insufficient data on these new entries for the collaborative filtering to work accurately. In order to make appropriate recommendations for a new user, the system must first learn the user&#x27;s preferences by analysing past voting or rating activities. The collaborative filtering system requires a substantial number of users to rate a new item before that item can be recommended.

==Challenges==

===Data sparsity===
In practice, many commercial recommender systems are based on large datasets. As a result, the user-item matrix used for collaborative filtering could be extremely large and sparse, which brings about challenges in the performance of the recommendation.

One typical problem caused by the data sparsity is the cold start problem. As collaborative filtering methods recommend items based on users&#x27; past preferences, new users will need to rate a sufficient number of items to enable the system to capture their preferences accurately and thus provides reliable recommendations.

Similarly, new items also have the same problem. When new items are added to the system, they need to be rated by a substantial number of users before they could be recommended to users who have similar tastes to the ones who rated them. The new item problem does not affect content-based recommendations, because the recommendation of an item is based on its discrete set of descriptive qualities rather than its ratings.

===Scalability===
As the numbers of users and items grow, traditional CF algorithms will suffer serious scalability problems. For example, with tens of millions of customers formula_9 and millions of items formula_10, a CF algorithm with the complexity of formula_11 is already too large. As well, many systems need to react immediately to online requirements and make recommendations for all users regardless of their millions of users, with most computations happening in very large memory machines.

===Synonyms===
Synonyms refers to the tendency of a number of the same or very similar items to have different names or entries. Most recommender systems are unable to discover this latent association and thus treat these products differently.

For example, the seemingly different items &quot;children&#x27;s movie&quot; and &quot;children&#x27;s film&quot; are actually referring to the same item. Indeed, the degree of variability in descriptive term usage is greater than commonly suspected. The prevalence of synonyms decreases the recommendation performance of CF systems. Topic Modeling (like the Latent Dirichlet Allocation technique) could solve this by grouping different words belonging to the same topic.

===Gray sheep===
Gray sheep refers to the users whose opinions do not consistently agree or disagree with any group of people and thus do not benefit from collaborative filtering. Black sheep are a group whose idiosyncratic tastes make recommendations nearly impossible. Although this is a failure of the recommender system, non-electronic recommenders also have great problems in these cases, so having black sheep is an acceptable failure.

===Shilling attacks===
In a recommendation system where everyone can give the ratings, people may give many positive ratings for their own items and negative ratings for their competitors&#x27;. It is often necessary for the collaborative filtering systems to introduce precautions to discourage such manipulations.

===Diversity and the long tail===
Collaborative filters are expected to increase diversity because they help us discover new products. Some algorithms, however, may unintentionally do the opposite. Because collaborative filters recommend products based on past sales or ratings, they cannot usually recommend products with limited historical data. This can create a rich-get-richer effect for popular products, akin to positive feedback. This bias toward popularity can prevent what are otherwise better consumer-product matches. A Wharton study details this phenomenon along with several ideas that may promote diversity and the &quot;long tail.&quot; Several collaborative filtering algorithms have been developed to promote diversity and the &quot;long tail&quot; by recommending novel, unexpected, and serendipitous items.

==Innovations==
* New algorithms have been developed for CF as a result of the Netflix prize.
* Cross-System Collaborative Filtering where user profiles across multiple recommender systems are combined in a multitask manner; this way, preference pattern sharing is achieved across models. 
* Robust collaborative filtering, where recommendation is stable towards efforts of manipulation. This research area is still active and not completely solved.

==Auxiliary information==

User-item matrix is a basic foundation of traditional collaborative filtering techniques, and it suffers from data sparsity problem (i.e. cold start). As a consequence, except for user-item matrix, researchers are trying to gather more auxiliary information to help boost recommendation performance and develop personalized recommender systems. Generally, there are two popular auxiliary information: attribute information and interaction information. Attribute information describes a user&#x27;s or an item&#x27;s properties. For example, user attribute might include general profile (e.g. gender and age) and social contacts (e.g. followers or friends in social networks); Item attribute means properties like category, brand or content. In addition, interaction information refers to the implicit data showing how users interplay with the item. Widely used interaction information contains tags, comments or reviews and browsing history etc. Auxiliary information plays a significant role in a variety of aspects. Explicit social links, as a reliable representative of trust or friendship, is always employed in similarity calculation to find similar persons who share interest with the target user. The interaction-associated information – tags – is taken as a third dimension (in addition to user and item) in advanced collaborative filtering to construct a 3-dimensional tensor structure for exploration of recommendation.

<text>Samuel Palmer Hon.RE (Hon. Fellow of the Society of Painter-Etchers) (27 January 180524 May 1881) was a British landscape painter, etcher and printmaker. He was also a prolific writer. Palmer was a key figure in Romanticism in Britain and produced visionary pastoral paintings.

==Early life==
Palmer, who was born in Surrey Square off the Old Kent Road in Newington, London (now Walworth), was the son of Samuel Palmer, a bookseller and sometime Baptist minister and Martha (nee Giles), but was raised by a pious nurse, Mary Ward. Palmer painted churches from around age twelve, and first exhibited Turner-inspired works at the Royal Academy at the age of fourteen. He had little formal training, and little formal schooling, although he was educated briefly at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School. On the 18th January 1818 Palmer&#x27;s mother Martha died suddenly, an event that affected they young Palmer for the rest of his life. He wrote &quot;It was like a sharp sword sent through the length of me&quot;.

==Shoreham==

Through John Linnell, he met William Blake in 1824. Blake&#x27;s influence can be seen in work he produced over the next ten years. The works were landscapes around Shoreham, near Sevenoaks in the west of Kent. He purchased a run-down cottage, nicknamed &quot;Rat Abbey&quot;, and lived there from 1826 to 1835, depicting the area as a demi-paradise, mysterious and visionary, often shown in sepia shades under moon and star light. There Palmer associated with a group of Blake-influenced artists known as the Ancients (including George Richmond and Edward Calvert). They were among the few who saw the Shoreham paintings as, resulting from attacks by critics in 1825, he opened his early portfolios only to selected friends.

Palmer&#x27;s somewhat disreputable father – Samuel Palmer senior – moved to the area, his brother Nathaniel having offered him an allowance that would &quot;make him a gentleman&quot; and restore the good name of the family. Samuel Palmer senior rented half of the Queen Anne-era &#x27;Waterhouse&#x27; which still stands by the River Darent at Shoreham and is now known as the &#x27;Water House&#x27;. Palmer&#x27;s nurse, Mary Ward, and his other son William joined him there. The Waterhouse was used to accommodate overflow guests from &quot;Rat Abbey&quot;. In 1828 Samuel Palmer left &quot;Rat Abbey&quot; to join his father at Water House and lived there for the rest of his time in Shoreham. While at Shoreham he fell in love with the fourteen-year-old Hannah Linnell, whom he later married.

==Maturity==

After returning to London in 1835, and using a legacy to purchase a house in Marylebone, Palmer produced less mystical and more conventional work. Part of his reason in returning to London was to sell his work and earn money from private teaching. He had better health on his return to London, and was by then married to Hannah, daughter of the painter John Linnell who he had known since she was a child, and married when she was nineteen and he was thirty-two. He sketched in Devonshire and Wales around this time. His peaceful vision of rural England had been disrupted by the violent rural discontent of the early 1830s. His small financial legacy was running out and he decided to produce work more in line with public taste if he was to earn an income for himself and his wife. He was following the advice of his father-in-law. Linnell, who had earlier shown remarkable understanding of the uniqueness of William Blake&#x27;s genius, was not as generous with his son-in-law, towards whom his attitude was authoritarian and often harsh.

Palmer turned more to watercolour which was gaining popularity in England. To further a commercial career, the couple embarked on a two-year honeymoon to Italy, made possible by money from Hannah&#x27;s parents in 1837. In Italy Palmer&#x27;s palette became brighter, sometimes to the point of garishness, but he made many fine sketches and studies that would later be useful in producing new paintings. On his return to London, Palmer sought patrons with limited success. For more than two decades he was obliged to work as a private drawing master, until he moved from London in 1862. To add to his financial worries, he returned to London to find his dissolute brother William had pawned all his early paintings, and Palmer was obliged to pay a large sum to redeem them. By all accounts Palmer was an excellent teacher, but the work with students reduced the time he could devote to his own art.

==Later years==
From the early 1860s he gained some measure of critical success for his later landscapes, which had a touch of the early Shoreham work about them – most notable is the etching of &quot;The Lonely Tower&quot; (1879). He became a full member of the Water Colour Society in 1854, and its annual show gave him a yearly goal to work towards.
His best late works include a series of large watercolours illustrating Milton&#x27;s poems &quot;L&#x27;Allegro&quot; and &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; and his etchings, a medium in which he worked from 1850 onwards, including a set illustrating Virgil.

Palmer&#x27;s later years were darkened by the death in 1861, at the age of 19, of his elder son Thomas More Palmer – a devastating blow from which he never fully recovered. He lived in various places later in his life, including a small cottage and an unaffordable villa both in Kensington, where he lived at 6 Douro Place, then a cottage at Reigate. But it was only when a small measure of financial security came his way, that was he able to move to Furze Hill House in Redhill, Surrey, from 1862. He could not afford to have a daily newspaper delivered to Redhill, suggesting that his financial circumstances there were still tight.

Palmer died in Redhill, Surrey, and is buried with his wife in St Mary&#x27;s, Reigate churchyard.

==Legacy==

=== Surge in the 1960s ===
Palmer was largely forgotten after his death. In 1909, many of his Shoreham works were destroyed by his surviving son Alfred Herbert Palmer, who burnt &quot;a great quantity of father&#x27;s handiwork ... Knowing that no one would be able to make head or tail of what I burnt; I wished to save it from a more humiliating fate&quot;. The destruction included &quot;sketchbooks, notebooks, and original works, and lasted for days&quot;. Interest in his work was rekindled in 1926 by a show curated by Martin Hardie at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum: &quot;Drawings, Etchings and Woodcuts made by Samuel Palmer and other Disciples of William Blake&quot;. In the ensuing decades, the publication of two important books and the presentation of another London exhibition combined to trigger a surge in his popularity: Geoffrey Grigson&#x27;s, &quot;Samuel Palmer: The Visionary Years&quot; (280 pages, with 68 photo illustrations, 1947), the Arts Council of Great Britain’s 1956-57 exhibition: &quot;Samuel Palmer and his circle - The Shoreham period,&quot; and Grigson&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Samuel&quot; &quot;Palmer&#x27;s Valley of Vision&quot; (forty-eight plates, a selection of Palmer&#x27;s writings, 1960). In the 1930s, the maximum price a Shoreham period drawing brought was around £50. Three sold in the early 1960s — &quot;Weald of Kent, The Evening Star,&quot; and &quot;Cow Lodge with a Mossy Roof&quot; — for £6000, £5200, and £7200. Leger Gallery purchased the diminutive watercolour &quot;The Golden Valley&quot; in 1969 for £14,000. In a 2003 auction at Christie’s, it brought £587,650.

The renewed popularity of his Shoreham work influenced a succession of English artists, notably F. L. Griggs, Robin Tanner, Graham Sutherland, Paul Drury, Joseph Webb, Eric Ravilious, John Minton, the glass engraving of Laurence Whistler, Franklin White and Clifford Harper. He also inspired a resurgence in twentieth-century landscape printmaking, which began amongst students at Goldsmiths&#x27; College in the 1920s. (See: Jolyon Drury, 2006)

=== Controversy in the 1970s ===
Palmer received a great deal of media attention in the 1970s, following the discovery of a number of fakes of his Shoreham work produced by famous art forger, Tom Keating. In February 1970, Geraldine Norman, Sale Room Correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;, published a glowing report on a rare Shoreham Palmer painting, which &#x27;probably dates from 1831&#x27;, &quot;Shepherds with their Flock under a Full Moon,&quot; that was purchased by a major Bond Street gallery for £9400. At the top of the page was a four-column-width photo of the picture. A month later, David Gould, an authority on Victorian paintings with a special interest in Palmer, wrote a Letter to the Editor calling it a fake.

In June 1973, Norman reported that a Palmer landscape, &quot;The Horse Chestnut Tree,&quot; sold at Sotheby’s for £15,000. Shortly thereafter, Gould privately alleged to Norman that it too, was dubious. In 1974 Gould told Norman he had identified six more Palmer fakes, and he believed all were done by the same hand.

In 1976, Norman began researching over a dozen suspect Palmers, and after consulting with recognized Palmer experts from the Ashmolean, Fitzwilliam, Tate, and British Museums, as well as author Geoffrey Grigson, she published an article on 16 July 1976, on page one of The Times, asserting that thirteen Palmer pictures that had appeared on the market over the previous decade were forgeries. Several tips from readers convinced her the master faker she was looking for was Tom Keating, a picture restorer in Dedham, Essex, whom she named in another page one article the following month. A few days later, Keating wrote a Letter to The Times, confessing to ‘flooding the market’ with fakes –– not for material gain, but rather as a protest against greedy art merchants –– adding that he couldn’t imagine how anyone could believe his ‘crude daubs’ were authentic. The lead story in the Daily Express the same day read, ‘I FAKED THE LOT!’

The following week, Mr. Hugh Leggatt, a well-respected art dealer in Westminster, offered to host an exhibition of Keating’s ‘Palmers’ at his gallery in St James&#x27;s Street. The Cecil Higgins Museum in Bedford had a Palmer called &quot;A Barn at Shoreham,&quot; purchased in 1965, on advice by Edward Croft Murray, the Keeper of Pictures at the British Museum, that it was authentic. They took it down in August 1976 when it was discovered to be a Keating fake. They rehung it four months later. Museum trustees commented ‘that there seemed to be more public interest in the drawing now it was known to be a fake than there had been in the genuine article.’ &quot;A Barn at Shoreham&quot; remains on view in the museum&#x27;s art store. 

Norman went on to publish a total of eleven articles on the scandal, from July 1976 to February 1977, for which she won the British Press Awards News Reporter of the Year. In June 1977 she published an essay on &quot;Art Trading and Art Faking,&quot; in Keating’s autobiography, as well as a companion book &quot;The Tom Keating Catalogue,&quot; with descriptions and photo illustrations of 166 of his known pastiches, including 26 Palmers, which she hoped would provide scholars, collectors, and art dealers with sufficient information to detect his work, and help locate and identify as many of them as possible.

Keating later claimed to have painted upwards of eighty fake Palmers, most of them moonlit scenes in dark sepia wash, heightened with white. Four of them sold for thousands of pounds each, including &quot;The Horse Chestnut Tree,&quot; which Sotheby’s auctioned in June 1973 for £15,000 — ‘a record price for the artist’. These same four pictures were illustrated in James Sellars’ 1974 monograph, &quot;Samuel Palmer,&quot; and their sales resulted in Keating being arrested and put on trial for art fraud at the Old Bailey in 1979. He was later released due to failing health, and all charges were dropped. In the May 1977 BBC1 documentary, &quot;A Picture of Tom Keating&quot;, the master forger, commenting on Palmer’s captivating self portrait (see at top of this page), called him ‘a child genius, who’s eyes stare at me with a majesty and beauty... I look back on them now and say I’m not ashamed of what I’ve done, because his name is now more famous than ever.’

Times journalist David Carritt replied: ‘How insulting Palmer would have found the new stock...his magic vision diluted by a crop of heartless impostures, conceived in spite and peddled for gain’.

On the bicentenary of the artist’s birth, a major retrospective showcasing a hundred and seventy of his watercolours, drawings, etchings and oils from public and private collections around the world, was organized by the British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Exhibited first in London from October 2005 to January 2006, then in New York from March to May 2006, &quot;Samuel Palmer: Vision and Landscape,&quot; emphasized his early work, but included more naturalistic watercolours, such as &quot;Scene from Lee&quot;, and &quot;A Cascade in Shadow,&quot; from his travels in Devon and Wales (1834-1836), as well as &quot;Cypresses at the Villa d&#x27;Este,&quot; and &quot;A View of Ancient Rome,&quot; from an ill-fated, two-year sojourn to Italy, with his new bride Hannah and his friend, George Richmond, and his wife (1837–38). The show concluded with works done after his return to England in 1840, such as the watercolour, &quot;Christian Descending into the Valley of Humiliation&quot; and the etchings, &quot;The Weary Ploughman&quot;, &quot;The Bellman&quot;, and &quot;The Lonely Tower&quot;.

In 2012, the Fine Art Society staged &quot;Samuel Palmer, His Friends and Followers,&quot; a London exhibition of Palmer’s influential visionary landscapes, along with works by Edward Calvert, George Richmond, Frederick Griggs, Paul Drury, Graham Sutherland, and Robin Tanner.

=== Commemorations ===
There are three commemorative plaques to Palmer. An unofficial blue plaque is located at Palmer&#x27;s birthplace at Surrey Square. The Grade II listed Waterhouse, in Shoreham, Kent, has a plaque on it commemorating Palmer&#x27;s residence there from 1827 to 1835. A Greater London Council blue plaque is located at 6 Douro Place, Kensington W8, marking that Palmer lived there from 1851 to 1861. His last home was The Chantry (the former Furze Hill Place), at Cronks Hill, near Redhill, which is Grade II listed for the Palmer connection.

The oldest house in Shoreham, Kent, is called Reed Beds, but is also known as the Samuel Palmer School of Fine Art. The National Portrait Gallery holds an 1829 portrait of Palmer by his friend George Richmond; the NPG&#x27;s catalogue notes state that Palmer&#x27;s expression and long hair recall Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s 1500 self-portrait as Christ.

Palmer Close, a cul-de-sac in Redhill (built in the 1960s) was named in his honour.

<text>The Queen&#x27;s Medical Centre (popularly known as QMC, Queen&#x27;s Med or Queen&#x27;s) is a teaching hospital situated in Nottingham, England. Until February 2012, when it was surpassed by the Royal London Hospital, it was the largest hospital in the United Kingdom, though it remains the largest major trauma centre in England. It is managed by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust.

==History==
In 1964 Health Minister Anthony Barber announced in Parliament that Nottingham had been selected for a new teaching hospital and medical school, with 1,200 beds and an annual intake of 100 students.

===Design and construction===
Legal delays with the purchase of the 43-acre site meant that building work did not commence until May 1971. The new hospital was designed by the Building Design Partnership, and was built by Taylor Woodrow Construction, at a cost of £25 million, initially for the medical school and for one-third of the hospital.

It was the first purpose-built teaching hospital in the UK. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 July 1977, and admitted its first patient in 1978. Lack of funding became a serious problem after 1979, and slowed the commissioning of later phases of the hospital. It was well into the 1980s before the project was completed.

===Operation===
Prince Charles had a three hour bone graft operation, under general anaesthetic, on 1 September 1990, after a broken arm had not healed, with surgeons John Webb and Chris Colton carrying out the procedure. On 1 April 2006, the Queen&#x27;s Medical Centre NHS Trust, that had previously run the hospital, merged with the Nottingham City Hospital NHS Trust to form the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. In April 2012, QMC was designated as the East Midlands Major Trauma Centre.

==Facilities==
The hospital has more than 1,300 beds and employs more than 6,000 people. It has a busy accident and emergency unit, and is the primary destination of the Lincolnshire &amp; Nottinghamshire Air Ambulance, for seriously injured patients. In 2016–17, there were 195,782 emergency attendances. It is the East Midlands&#x27; main hospital for acute cases. The QMC site also contains the University of Nottingham Medical and Nursing Schools, Mental Health Wards and the privately run Nottingham Treatment Centre.

The Nottingham Children&#x27;s Hospital was founded in 1869 in Russell House. Nursing staff were drawn from the Sisters of St Lucy which led to it being given the unofficial name &quot;St Lucy&#x27;s&quot;. In 1899 it moved to larger premises at Forest House, donated by the lace manufacturer Thomas Birkin. In 1978, the occupants became the first in-patients of QMC when they were moved to the hospital&#x27;s current location in East Block. The hospital cares for about 40,000 children up to 18 years old each year. It has 116 beds. On 17 August 2020 Nottingham Children&#x27;s Hospital (along with NUH Sexual Health Services) received the American Nursing Credentialing Centre (ANCC) Pathway To Excellence designation in recognition of nursing excellence. It was the first Children&#x27;s Hospital in Europe to receive this designation.

== Transport ==
The hospital is situated at the junction of the dual-carriageway Nottingham Ring Road (A6514) and the east–west A52 and A6200. There is a Medilink bus service, which connects Queen&#x27;s Drive (Park and Ride) with Queen&#x27;s Medical Centre, Wilkinson Street (for park and ride) and Nottingham City Hospital. Trent Barton’s indigo, i4 and Red Arrow and Nottingham City Transport&#x27;s Grey Line 53, 54 and Orange Line 34, 35 and 36 bus services stop near to QMC.

The Queen&#x27;s Medical Centre tram stop, on line 1 of the Nottingham Express Transit, is situated between the South Block of the main hospital and the Treatment Centre. The tram connects QMC with Beeston, Nottingham Station, Nottingham City Centre, Basford, Bulwell and Hucknall. Passengers can change to Line 2 of the tram, which connects Phoenix Park (M1 Junction 26) with Clifton, at Nottingham station.

== In the media ==
The hospital is part of the long-running Channel 4 documentary series &quot;24 Hours in A&amp;E&quot;.

<text>In publishing, a slush pile is a set of unsolicited query letters or manuscripts that have either been directly sent to a publisher by an author, or which have been delivered via a literary agent representing the author who may or may not be familiar to the publisher. The responsibility of sifting through slush piles is usually reserved either to editor assistants or to outside contractors called publisher&#x27;s readers or &quot;first readers&quot;. If the reader finds something of interest and can convince a senior editor to accept it, they may earn credit.

Most agents and major publishing houses do not accept unsolicited manuscripts and slush piles are on average usually regarded as undesirable in many literary circles due to the large number of both aspiring and former writers who often produce content of unsatisfactory quality. However, this is not always the case with many smaller publishers or independent editors who are often open to both inexperienced and formerly established writers—both of whom may be able to create original content for the publisher and potentially turn a profit.

In 2008, HarperCollins introduced a website, authonomy, to manage and exploit the slush pile from a web-based perspective, but it was closed in 2015 because writers were gaming the system. Website Youwriteon acts as a slush pile filter for Random House, Orion Publishing Group and Bloomsbury Publishing.

<text>Xylosma is a genus of flowering plants in the family Salicaceae. It contains around 100 species of evergreen shrubs and trees commonly known as brushhollies, xylosmas, or, more ambiguously, &quot;[[logwood]]s&quot;. The generic name is derived from the Greek words ξύλον (&quot;xylon&quot;), meaning &quot;wood, tree&quot;, and ὀσμή (&quot;osmé&quot;), meaning &quot;smell&quot;, referring to the fragrant wood of some of the species. The Takhtajan system places it in the family Flacourtiaceae, which is considered defunct by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group.

==Description==
The leaves are alternate, simple, entire or finely toothed, long. The flowers are small, yellowish, produced on racemes long, usually dioecious, and have a strong scent. The fruit is a small purple-black berry in diameter that contains 2 to 8 seeds.

==Species==

==Distribution==
The genus is predominantly native to the tropics and subtropics, from the Caribbean, Central America, northern South America, the Pacific Islands, southern Asia and northern Australasia. One species, &quot;X. congesta&quot;, is found in warm-temperate eastern Asia (China, Korea and Japan). Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggest that the genus &quot;Lasiochlamys&quot; from New Caledonia may be nested in &quot;Xylosma&quot;.

==Ecology==
&quot;Xylosma&quot; foliage is used as food by the caterpillars of some lepidoptera, such as the rustic (&quot;Cupha erymanthis&quot;), which feeds on &quot;X. congesta&quot; (syn. &quot;X. racemosa&quot;), and the common leopard (&quot;Phalanta phalantha&quot;), which feeds on &quot;X. longifolia&quot; and &quot;X. congesta&quot;.

==Uses==
The main use for the genus is as hedge and topiary plants among gardeners in desert and chaparral climates. &quot;Xylosma congesta&quot; is the species usually seen in garden hedges and in road landscaping, despite the fact it bears thorns. Other species cultivated for these purposes include &quot;X. bahamensis&quot;, &quot;X. flexuosa&quot;, and &quot;X. spiculifera&quot; (syn. &quot;X. heterophylla&quot;). &quot;X. longifolia&quot; is sometimes grown in India for its edible fruits. In addition, a medicinal extract is made from its young leaves that acts as antispasmodic, narcotic, and sedative. 15 species of the genus have reported medicinal or veterinary use.

<text>Gordon Randall Phillip David Garrett (December 16, 1927 – December 31, 1987) was an American science fiction and fantasy author. He was a contributor to &quot;Astounding&quot; and other science fiction magazines of the 1950s and &#x27;60s. He instructed Robert Silverberg in the techniques of selling large quantities of action-adventure science fiction, and collaborated with him on two novels about men from Earth disrupting a peaceful agrarian civilization on an alien planet.

==Biography and writing career==

Garrett is best known for the &quot;Lord Darcy&quot; books — the novel &quot;Too Many Magicians&quot; and two short story collections — set in an alternate world where a joint Anglo-French empire still led by a Plantagenet dynasty has survived into the twentieth century and where magic works and has been scientifically codified. The Darcy books are rich in jokes, puns, and references (particularly to works of detective and spy fiction: Lord Darcy is modeled on Sherlock Holmes), elements often appearing in the shorter works about the detective. Michael Kurland wrote two additional Lord Darcy novels after Garrett&#x27;s death.

Garrett wrote under a variety of pseudonyms, including: David Gordon; John Gordon; Darrel T. Langart (an anagram of his name); Alexander Blade; Richard Greer; Ivar Jorgensen; Clyde Mitchell; Leonard G. Spencer; S. M. Tenneshaw; and Gerald Vance. He was also a founding member of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA), as &quot;Randall of Hightower&quot; (a pun on &quot;garret&quot;). The short novel &quot;Brain Twister&quot;, written by Garrett with author Laurence Janifer (using the joint pseudonym Mark Phillips), was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960.

An inveterate punster (defining a pun as &quot;the odor given off by a decaying mind&quot;), Garrett was a favorite guest at science fiction conventions and a friend to many fans, especially in Southern California. According to various anecdotes in a tribute volume, Garrett was cherished by his friends, who often repeated anecdotes of his behavior, but horrified many women, to whom he routinely introduced himself with obscene propositions. For example, he introduced himself to Marion Zimmer Bradley (MZB) with the Latin sentence &quot;Coito ergo sum&quot;, (sic) which she did not understand until it was explained to her some time later as an obscenity, and at another time to a pregnant Anne McCaffrey with &quot;sly innuendoes&quot; that horrified her. Philip José Farmer recounted an anecdote where Garrett was punched by his then-wife for having a pair of someone else&#x27;s lace underpants in his pocket, later being seen running naked through a hotel after having been caught having sex with another woman in the wrong room (presumably also the wrong woman).

Frank Herbert said: 

Isaac Asimov referred to Garrett&#x27;s offending Judith Merril to the point where she emptied an ashtray over his and Garrett&#x27;s heads.

Garrett, Poul Anderson and other friends were members of the Elves&#x27;, Gnomes&#x27; and Little Men&#x27;s Science Fiction, Chowder, and Marching Society, centered in Berkeley, California. https://fancyclopedia.org/Little_Men One of those members was Geoff Kidd, to whom Poul Anderson dedicated his book &quot;The Earth Book of Stormgate&quot;.

Kidd, who is currently a proofreader for Baen Books, recalls a quatrain that Garrett declaimed at one of the Little Men meetings:
&quot;There are thousands of laws legislators have spoken,
A few the Creator sent.
The former are being continually broken
The latter can&#x27;t even be bent.&quot; He thinks it should be officially attributed.

Garrett was married to fellow author Vicki Ann Heydron, who largely wrote the &quot;Gandalara Cycle&quot; fantasy series credited to both spouses; they met in 1975, at the home of their mutual agent, and were married in December 1978. In 1986, Heydron specified that she had been Garrett&#x27;s third wife &quot;and at least his sixth collaborator&quot;.

In 1999, Randall Garrett was posthumously awarded the Sidewise Award for Alternate History Special Achievement Award for the Lord Darcy series. He was also ordained in the Old Catholic Church. Glen Cook&#x27;s private detective character Garrett P.I. is named in honor of Garrett.

==Health==
In the summer of 1979, Garrett contracted a viral infection which led to meningitis and/or encephalitis, and, subsequently, severe amnesia. Hoping that his condition was temporary, Heydron served as his caregiver for two years, but in August 1981, &quot;for the sake of his health and [her own] sanity, [...] allowed him to be hospitalized.&quot;

In &quot;The Best of Randall Garrett&quot;, a combined anthology and festschrift which was published in January 1982, editor Robert Silverberg (a personal friend of Garrett&#x27;s) stated that although the infection &quot;for a time threatened [Garrett&#x27;s] life and for a much longer time has made it impossible for him to work&quot;, Garrett was &quot;fighting his way back to full recovery&quot; — and, indeed, when Algis Budrys reviewed the anthology in the August 1982 issue of &quot;the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, he stated that he had been told that &quot;when last seen, Garrett was seated at a dinner table, cheerfully ignoring the assembled company and attempting to remember the words to a dirty song&quot;; however, in October 1982, Dave Langford reported that the Hugo Award ceremony at that year&#x27;s Worldcon had included an announcement that Garrett &quot;had permanently lost his memory&quot;. By 1986, the &quot;about the authors&quot; text in the novel &quot;The River Wall&quot;, credited to Garrett and Heydron, described Garrett as having suffered &quot;serious and permanent injury&quot;, and in 2011, Langford and Brian M. Stableford&#x27;s entry on Garrett in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; summarized him as having been &quot;hospitalized from 1981 until his death&quot; in 1987.

<text>Oracle bone script is the oldest attested form of written Chinese, dating to the late 2nd millennium BC. Inscriptions were made by carving characters into oracle bones, usually either the shoulder bones of oxen or the plastrons of turtles. The writings themselves mainly record the results of official divinations carried out on behalf of the Late Shang royal family. These divinations took the form of &quot;scapulimancy&quot; where the oracle bones were exposed to flames, creating patterns of cracks that were then subjected to interpretation. Both the prompt and interpretation were inscribed on the same piece of bone that had been used for the divination itself.

Out of an estimated 150,000 inscriptions that have been uncovered, the vast majority were unearthed at Yinxu, the site of the final Shang capital (modern-day Anyang, Henan). The most recent major discovery was the Huayuanzhuang cache found near the site in 1993. Of the 1,608 Huayuanzhang pieces, 579 bear inscriptions. Each of the last nine Shang kings are named in the inscriptions beginning with Wu Ding, whose accession is variously dated between 1250 and 1200 BC. Oracle bone inscriptions corresponding to Wu Ding&#x27;s reign have been radiocarbon dated to 1254–1197 BC (±10 years). Following the overthrow of the Shang by the Zhou dynasty in , divination using milfoil became more common; far fewer oracle bone inscriptions are dated to the Western Zhou. No Zhou-era sites with a comparable cache of inscriptions to Yinxu have been found; however, examples from this period appear to be more widespread, having been found near most major population centers. New sites have continued to be discovered since 2000.

The oracle bone inscriptions—along with several roughly contemporaneous bronzeware inscriptions using a different style—constitute the earliest corpus of Chinese writing, and are the direct ancestor of the Chinese family of scripts developed over the next three millennia. Their study is essential for the research of Chinese etymologies. It is also the direct ancestor of over a dozen East Asian writing systems. The length of inscriptions ranges from 10 to over 100 characters, but a few dozen is typical. The subjects of concern in inscriptions are broad, and include war, ritual sacrifice, and agriculture, as well as births, illnesses, and deaths in the royal family. As such, they provide invaluable insights into the character of late Shang society.

== Name ==
The common Chinese term for oracle bone script is ( &#x27;shell and bone script&#x27;), which is an abbreviation of ( &#x27;turtle-shell and animal-bone script&#x27;). This term is a translation of the English phrase &quot;inscriptions upon bone and tortoise shell&quot;, which had been coined by the American missionary Frank H. Chalfant (1862–1914) in his 1906 book &quot;Early Chinese Writing&quot;, which first appeared in Chinese books during the 1930s.
In earlier decades, Chinese authors used a variety of names for the inscriptions based on the name of Yinxu, their purpose ( &#x27;to divine&#x27;), or the method of inscription ( &#x27;to engrave&#x27;). A previously common term was ( &#x27;Yinxu divinatory texts&#x27;). 

===Oraculology===
Oraculology () is the study of oracle bones and oracle bone script. It is a humanities discipline that focuses on the Chinese Upper Antiquity oracle characters. Oracle bone science can be divided into a narrow sense of oracle bone science and a broad sense of oracle bone science. In the narrow sense, the study of oracle bone script is limited to the study of oracle bone script itself, and it is a discipline of paleography. This includes the integration of theories, research methods and materials from various disciplines, such as paleography, history, archaeology, historical culture, historical literature, and cultural anthropology, to thoroughly study the historical and cultural background of the oracle bones and some of the patterns of the oracle bone divination. It is a diversified and specialized discipline. In the early days of oracle bone discovery, oracle bones were called &quot;qiwen&quot;, and the study of oracle bones was called &quot;qiology&quot;. In 1931, Zhou Yitong proposed for the first time that &quot;oracle bone science&quot; was an independent discipline. Wang Yuxin emphasized that oracle bones are precious cultural relics and historical materials left over from the ancient period, but their value for archaeological and historical research lies in orthography beyond script interpretation, which has become increasingly recognized by scholars as orthography develops. Oracle bone science is a systematic and scientific inquiry into the inherent laws of the oracle bone script itself and uses it as a basis for glimpsing the history, society, and customs of the ancient world. The oracle bones should not be confused with orthography.

== Origins ==

It is generally agreed that the tradition of writing represented by oracle bone script existed prior to the first known examples, due to the attested script&#x27;s mature state. Many characters had already undergone extensive simplifications and linearizations, and techniques of semantic extension and phonetic loaning had also clearly been used by authors for some time, perhaps centuries. However, no clearly identifiable examples of writing dating prior to the 13th century BC have been discovered. Sets of inscribed symbols on pottery, jade, and bone that have been discovered at a variety of Neolithic archeological sites across China have not been demonstrated to have any direct or indirect ancestry to the Shang oracle bone script at Anyang.

== Style ==


Along with the contemporary bronzeware script, the oracle bone script of the Late Shang period appears pictographic. The earliest oracle bone script appears even more so than examples from late in the period (thus some evolution did occur over the roughly 200-year period). Comparing the oracle bone script to both Shang and early Western Zhou period writing on bronzes, the oracle bone script is clearly greatly simplified, and rounded forms are often converted to rectilinear ones; this is thought to be due to the difficulty of engraving the bone&#x27;s hard surface, compared with the ease of writing them in the wet clay of the molds the bronzes were cast from. The more detailed and more pictorial style of the bronze graphs is thought to be more representative of typical Shang writing using bamboo books than the oracle bone forms; this typical style continued to evolve into writing styles of the Western Zhou period, and then into the seal script within the state of Qin.
It is known that the Shang people also wrote with brush and ink, as brush-written graphs have been found on a small number of pottery, shell and bone, and jade and other stone items, and there is evidence that they also wrote on bamboo (or wooden) books just like those found from the late Zhou to Han periods, because the graphs for a writing brush ( , depicting a hand holding a writing brush) and bamboo book ( , a book of thin bamboo and wooden slips bound with horizontal strings, like a Venetian blind turned 90 degrees), are present in oracle bone inscriptions.

Since the ease of writing with a brush is even greater than that of writing with a stylus in wet clay, it is assumed that the style and structure of Shang graphs on bamboo were similar to those on bronzes, and also that the majority of writing occurred with a brush on such books. Additional support for this notion includes the reorientation of some graphs, by rotating them 90 degrees, as if to better fit on tall, narrow slats. The style must have developed on books of bamboo or wood slats, and then carried over to the oracle bone script. Additionally, the layout of characters in columns from top to bottom is mostly carried over from bamboo books. In some instances, characters are instead written in rows in order to match the text with divinatory cracks; in others, columns of text rotate 90 degrees mid-phrase. These are exceptions to the normal pattern of writing, and inscriptions were never read bottom to top. Columns of text in Chinese writing are traditionally laid out from right to left; this pattern is first found with the Shang-era bronze inscriptions. However, oracle bone inscriptions are often arranged with columns beginning near the center of the shell or bone, then moving toward the edge such that the two sides mirror one another.

== Structure and function ==


Despite the pictorial nature of the oracle bone script, it was a fully functional and mature writing system by the time of the Shang dynasty, meaning it was able to record the Old Chinese language, and not merely fragments of ideas or words. This level of maturity clearly implies an earlier period of development of at least several hundred years. From their presumed origins as pictographs and signs, by the Shang dynasty, most graphs were already conventionalized in such a simplified fashion that the meanings of many of the pictographs are not immediately apparent. Without careful research to compare these to later forms, one would probably not know that these represented &#x27;swine&#x27; and &#x27;dog&#x27; respectively. As William G. Boltz notes, most of the oracle bone graphs are not depicted realistically enough for those who do not already know the script to recognize what they stand for; although pictographic in origin, they are no longer pictographs in function. Boltz instead calls them &quot;zodiographs&quot;, emphasizing their function as representing concepts exclusively through words. Similarly, Qiu labels them &quot;semantographs&quot;.

By the late Shang, oracle bone graphs had already evolved into mostly non-pictographic forms, including all the major types of Chinese characters now in use. Loangraphs, phono-semantic compounds, and associative compounds were already common. One structural and functional analysis of the oracle bone characters found that they were 23% pictographs, 2% simple indicatives, 32% associative compounds, 11% phonetic loans, 27% phono-semantic compounds, and 6% undetermined.
Although it was a fully functional writing system, the oracle bone script was not fully standardized. By the early Western Zhou period, these traits had vanished, but in both periods, the script was not highly regular or standardized; variant forms of graphs abound, and the size and orientation of graphs is also irregular. A graph when inverted horizontally generally refers to the same word, and additional components are sometimes present without changing the meaning. These irregularities persisted until the standardization of the seal script during the Qin dynasty.

There are over 30,000 distinct characters found from all the bone fragments so far, which may represent around 4,000 individual characters in their various forms. The majority of these still remain undeciphered, although scholars believe they can decipher between 1,500 and 2,000 of these characters. One reason for the difficulty in decipherment is that components of certain oracle bone script characters may differ in later script forms. Such differences may be accounted for by character simplification and/or by later generations misunderstanding the original graph, which had evolved beyond recognition. For instance, the standard character &#x27;autumn&#x27; now appears with the components &#x27;plant stalk&#x27; and &#x27;fire&#x27;, whereas the oracle bone form depicts an insect-like figure with antennae – either a cricket or a locust – with a variant depicting fire below said figure. In this case, the modern character is a simplification of an archaic variant (or ) which is closer to the oracle bone script form – albeit with the insect figure being confused with the similar-looking character for &#x27;turtle&#x27; and the addition of the component.
Some characters are only attested in the oracle bone script, dropping out of later usage and usually being replaced by newer characters. An example is a fragment bearing character for &#x27;spring&#x27; that has no known modern counterpart. In such cases, available context may be used to determine the possible meaning of the character. In other cases, the character may be assumed to be a phono-semantic compound, and a rough meaning can be inferred based on the semantic component. For instance, an oracle bone character was recently found which consists of on the left and on the right ([] when converted from oracle bone forms to their modern printed equivalents). This character may reasonably be guessed to a compound with &#x27;altar&#x27; as the semantic and (modern reading &quot;sheng&quot;) as the phonetic. Though no modern character consists of these two components, it likely refers to a type of Shang dynasty ritual with a name similar to the pronunciation of in Old Chinese. In the same collection of fragments, the character was surmised to be a place name, since the semantic component means &#x27;mound&#x27;, &#x27;hill&#x27;, and the divination concerned the king traveling for a royal hunt.

== Zhou-era inscriptions ==
There are relatively few oracle bone inscriptions dating after the conquest of the Shang by the Zhou dynasty (). From their initial discovery during the 1950s, only a handful of examples from this later period had been uncovered, and those that did were fragments consisting of only one or two characters. In August 1977, a cache containing thousands of Zhou-era oracle bones was discovered at a site closely linked to the ancient Zhou heartland. Among thousands of pieces, 200–300 bore inscriptions.

== Scholarship ==
Among the major scholars making significant contributions to the study of the oracle bone writings, especially early on, were:
* Wang Yirong recognized the characters as being ancient Chinese writing in 1899.
* Liu E collected five thousand oracle bone fragments, published the first collection of 1,058 rubbings entitled &quot;Tieyun Canggui&quot; (, Tie Yun&#x27;s [i.e., Liu E] Repository of Turtles) in 1903, and correctly identified thirty-four characters.
* Sun Yirang was the first serious researcher of oracle bones.
* Luo Zhenyu collected over 30,000 oracle bones and published several volumes, identified the names of the Shang kings, and thus positively identified the oracle bones as being artifacts from the Shang reign.
* Wang Guowei demonstrated that the commemorative cycle of the Shang kings matched the list of kings in Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Historian&quot;.
* Dong Zuobin identified the diviners and established a chronology for the oracle bones as well as numerous other dating criteria.
* Guo Moruo editor of the &quot;Jiaguwen Heji&quot;, the largest published collection of oracle bones. 
* Ken-ichi Takashima, first scholar to systematically treat the language of the oracle bones from the perspective of modern linguistics.

== Computer encoding ==
A proposal to include the oracle bone script in Unicode is being prepared. Code points U+35400–U+36BFF in Unicode Plane 3 (the Tertiary Ideographic Plane) have been tentatively allocated.

<text>PicoBSD is a discontinued single-floppy disk version of FreeBSD, one of the BSD operating system descendants. In its different variations, PicoBSD allows one to have secure dial-up Internet access, a small diskless router, or a dial-in server, all on one standard floppy disc. It runs on a minimum 386SX CPU with of RAM (no hard drive required).

PicoBSD is freely available under the BSD license. The main developer was Andrzej Bialecki, and the latest version is 0.42. Dinesh Nair had then backported the PicoBSD build scripts to FreeBSD 2.2.5, allowing the addition of a few more binaries in the dial-up flavor due to FreeBSD 2.2.5&#x27;s smaller binary executable format.

With flexibility that FreeBSD gives, along with the full source code being available, one can build a small installation performing various tasks, including:

*Diskless workstation
*Portable dial-up access solution
*Custom demo-disk
*Embedded controller (flash or EEPROM)
*Firewall
*Communication server
*Replacement for commercial router
*Diskless home automation system
*And many others

PicoBSD is now included in the FreeBSD source files where it is used by embedded system developers to create their own system images. It can be used with recent versions of FreeBSD and it is located in /usr/src/release/picobsd/.

In FreeBSD 5, it has been superseded by the NanoBSD framework

<text>Sir Thomas Wyse (24 December 1791 – 16 April 1862), an Irish politician and diplomat, belonged to a family claiming descent from a Devon Squire, Andrew Wyse, who is said to have crossed over to Ireland during the reign of Henry II and obtained lands near Waterford, of which city thirty-three members of the family are said to have been Mayors or other municipal officers: one, John Wyse, was Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in the 1490s.

==Life==
From the Reformation the family had been consistently attached to the Catholic Church. Wyse was educated at Stonyhurst College and at Trinity College Dublin, where he distinguished himself as a scholar. After 1815, he passed some years in travel, visiting Italy, Greece, Egypt and Palestine. In 1821, he married Princess Laetitia Bonaparte (1804–1871), daughter of Lucien Bonaparte, and after residing for a time at Viterbo he returned to Ireland in 1825, having by this time inherited the family estates.

He now devoted his great oratorical and other talents to forwarding the cause of Catholic emancipation, and his influence was specially marked in his own county of Waterford, while his standing among his associates was shown by his being chosen to write the address to the people of England.

In 1830, after the passing of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, he was returned to parliament for the County Tipperary constituency. He attached himself to the Whig Party and voted for the great measures of the reform era. But he was specially anxious to secure some improvement in the education of the Irish people, and some of his proposals were accepted by Edward Stanley, later 14th Earl of Derby, and the government, he was chairman of a committee which inquired into the condition of education in Ireland, and it was partly owing to his efforts that provincial colleges were established at Cork, Galway and Belfast.

His work as an educational pioneer also bore fruit in England, where the principles of state control and inspection, for which he had fought, were adopted, and where a training college for teachers at Battersea was established on lines suggested by him. From 1835 to 1847 he was MP for the Waterford City constituency, from 1839 to 1841 he was a Lord of the Treasury, from 1846 to 1849 he was Secretary to the Board of Control, and in 1849 he was sent as British minister to Greece. In that capacity he was a major figure in the notorious Don Pacifico Incident. He was very successful in his diplomacy, and he showed a great interest in the educational and other internal affairs of Greece. In 1857, he was made a KCB, and he died at Athens on 16 April 1862.

Wyse wrote &quot;Historical Sketch of the late Catholic Association of Ireland&quot; (London 1829), &quot;Education reform or the necessity of a national system of education&quot; (London 1836), &quot;An Excursion in the Peloponnesus&quot; (1858, new ed. 1865), and &quot;Impressions of Greece&quot; (London 1871).

His two sons shared his literary tastes: They were Napoleon Alfred Bonaparte-Wyse (1822–1895) and William Charles Bonaparte-Wyse (1826–1892), a student of the dialect of Provence. The marriage to his wife Laetitia, thirteen years younger than he and only sixteen years old when the wedding took place, did not last. After an especially violent fight in 1824 (so fierce that their carriage rocked on its springs), she fled to a convent and asked for a separation. Wyse and Laetitia got a papal order of seclusion in the convent. After eight months, when Wyse threatened to leave Italy without her, she submitted and travelled to Ireland with him.

However the arguments continued and in May 1828, they agreed to a separation. Laetitia threw herself in a suicide attempt into the Serpentine and was rescued by Captain Studholme John Hodgson (1805–1890), a British Army officer who became her lover. They had three children who survived to adulthood: the writer Marie Laetitia Bonaparte-Wyse (1831–1902, called secretly Studholmina-Maria) who was known as Princess Marie de Solms in her first marriage; Adeline (1838–1899), who married in 1861 the Hungarian general István Türr; and the explorer Lucien Napoléon Bonaparte-Wyse (1845–1909). All of them married and left children; all the children of Captain Hodgson and Princess Laetitia used the surname Bonaparte-Wyse.

Wyse was the subject of a biography written by James Auchmuty, &quot;Sir Thomas Wyse, 1791–1862: the life and career of an educator and diplomat&quot;, London 1939.

==Family and children==
Wyse married Princess Laetitia Bonaparte (Milan, 1 December 1804 – Viterbo, 15 March 1871), daughter of Lucien Bonaparte and his second wife Alexandrine de Bleschamp, in Canino on 4 March 1821. Their children were: 
* Napoleon Alfred Bonaparte-Wyse, Esq. (Rome, 1822 – Paris, 1895), unmarried and without issue;
* William Charles Bonaparte-Wyse (Waterford, 1826 - Cannes, 1892);
* Marie Laetitia Bonaparte-Wyse (Waterford, 1831 - Paris, 1902);
* Adelina Bonaparte Wyse (Waterford, 1838 – Berck, 1899), married in Mantua in 1861 to István Türr (Baja, 1825 - 1908); 
* Lucien Napoléon Bonaparte-Wyse (Paris, 1845 - 1909).

Though legally his children, Marie Laetitia, Adeline and Lucien Napoléon were the biological children of Bonaparte and her lover, Captain Studholme John Hodgson.

<text>Comet Encke , or Encke&#x27;s Comet (official designation: 2P/Encke), is a periodic comet that completes an orbit of the Sun once every 3.3 years. (This is the shortest period of a reasonably bright comet; the faint main-belt comet 311P/PanSTARRS has a period of 3.2 years.) Encke was first recorded by Pierre Méchain on 17 January 1786, but it was not recognized as a periodic comet until 1819 when its orbit was computed by Johann Franz Encke. Like Halley&#x27;s Comet, it is unusual in its being named after the calculator of its orbit rather than its discoverer. Like most comets, it has a very low albedo, reflecting only 4.6% of the light its nucleus receives, although comets generate a large coma and tail that can make them much more visible during their perihelion (closest approach to the Sun). The diameter of the nucleus of Encke&#x27;s Comet is 4.8 km.

== Discovery ==
As its official designation implies, Encke&#x27;s Comet was the first periodic comet discovered after Halley&#x27;s Comet (designated 1P/Halley). It was independently observed by several astronomers, the first two being Pierre Méchain and Charles Messier in 1786. It was next observed by Caroline Herschel in 1795 and was &quot;discovered&quot; for a third time by Jean-Louis Pons in 1818. Its orbit was calculated by Johann Franz Encke, who through laborious calculations was able to link observations of comets in 1786 (designated 2P/1786 B1), 1795 (2P/1795 V1), 1805 (2P/1805 U1) and 1818 (2P/1818 W1) to the same object. In 1819 he published his conclusions in the journal &quot;Correspondance astronomique&quot;, and predicted correctly its return in 1822 (2P/1822 L1). It was recovered by Carl Ludwig Christian Rümker at Parramatta Observatory on 2 June 1822.

== Orbit ==
Comets are in unstable orbits that evolve over time due to perturbations and outgassing. Given Encke&#x27;s low orbital inclination near the ecliptic and brief orbital period of 3 years, the orbit of Encke is frequently perturbed by the inner planets. Encke is currently close to a 7:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, and it is possible that some of the larger fragments shed by the comet, or released by a larger progenitor of the comet, are trapped in this resonance.

Encke&#x27;s orbit gets as close as to Earth (minimum orbit intersection distance). On 4 July 1997, Encke passed 0.19 AU from Earth, and on June 29, 2172, it will make a close approach of roughly 0.1735 AU. On 18 November 2013, it passed from Mercury. Close approaches to Earth usually occur every 33 years.

Comet Encke has a perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) of , and at perihelion Comet Encke passes the Sun at . Between 1769 and 2103, Comet Encke&#x27;s perihelion distance only varies from 0.330 AU (in 2050) and 0.347 AU (in 1782). Of the numbered comets less than 321P, only 96P/Machholz gets closer to the Sun.

== Observations ==
The comet has been observed at every perihelion since 1818 except 1944.

An attempt to photograph the comet close to aphelion was made on 2 July 1913 using the Mount Wilson 60-inch telescope but the resulting photographic plate was lost in the mail. A second attempt using the same telescope was made on 1 September 1913 and this showed an object in about the right position (1.5 arcminutes from its then predicted position) but orbital uncertainties made it impossible to be sure of its identity. A recalculation of Encke&#x27;s orbit in the 1970s resulted in a calculated position only a few arcseconds (2.0 in ascension and 4.6 in declination) from the imaged object meaning the object probably was Encke.

In March 1918 the Greenwich 28-inch aperture telescope took observations of Encke (1917c).

An observer of Encke&#x27;s in March 1918 had this to say of the comet on March 12, comparing to the early March 9 observation, &quot;The comet much shaper, brighter, smaller; its diameter was 1 1/2&#x27;, magnitude 7.7 (B.D. scale). Its magnitude in the 6-inch Corbett was almost stellar, but in the 28 inch no definitive nucleus could be seen.&quot;

A number of attempts were made to image the comet around the aphelion of 3 September 1972. Elizabeth Roemer and G. McCorkle photographed the comet on 15 August. R.E. McCrosky and C.-Y. Shao photographed it on 5 September and Elizabeth Roemer this time with M.R. Gonzales photographed the comet on 13 September.

In 1980 Encke was the first comet to be detected by radar.

In April 1984 the Pioneer Venus Orbiter observed the comet in ultra-violet and made measurements of its rate of water loss.

The failed &quot;CONTOUR&quot; mission was launched to study this comet, and also Schwassmann–Wachmann 3.
On 20 April 2007, STEREO-A observed the tail of Comet Encke to be temporarily torn off by magnetic field disturbances caused by a coronal mass ejection (a blast of solar particles from the Sun). The tail grew back due to the continuous shedding of dust and gas by the comet.

===Proposed missions===
In the 70s Germany proposed using a space probe based on the Helios probes to explore the comet.

In the 1970s the Goddard Space Flight Centre and Jet Propulsion Laboratory proposed to NASA probes that would fly past the comet in 1980. The Goddard Space Flight Centre&#x27;s proposal was for a pair of probes launched directly towards the comet while the Jet Propulsion Laboratory plan was to use Solar electric propulsion. NASA did not attempt either mission.

NASA’s failed CONTOUR probe was planned to perform a flyby of Encke in November 2003.

== Meteor showers ==

Comet Encke is believed to be the originator of several related meteor showers known as the Taurids (which are encountered as the Northern and Southern Taurids across November, and the Beta Taurids in late June and early July). A shower has similarly been reported affecting Mercury.

Near-Earth object may be a fragment of Encke.

=== Mercury ===
Measurements on board the NASA satellite &quot;MESSENGER&quot; have revealed Encke may contribute to seasonal meteor showers on Mercury. The Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS) instrument discovered seasonal surges of calcium since the probe began orbiting the planet in March 2011. The spikes in calcium levels are thought to originate from small dust particles hitting the planet and knocking calcium-bearing molecules into the atmosphere in a process called impact vaporization. However, the general background of interplanetary dust in the inner Solar System cannot, by itself, account for the periodic spikes in calcium. This suggests a periodic source of additional dust, for example, a cometary debris field.

==Effects on Earth==
More than one theory has associated Encke&#x27;s Comet with impacts of cometary material on Earth, and with cultural significance.

The Tunguska event of 1908 may have been caused by the impact of a cometary body and has also been postulated by Czechoslovakian astronomer Ľubor Kresák as possibly caused by a fragment of Comet Encke.
A theory holds that the ancient symbol of the swastika appeared in a variety of cultures across the world at a similar time, and could have been inspired by the appearance of a comet from head on, as the curved jets would be reminiscent of the swastika shape (see Comets and the swastika motif). Comet Encke has sometimes been identified as the comet in question. In their 1982 book &quot;Cosmic Serpent&quot; (page 155) Victor Clube and Bill Napier reproduce an ancient Chinese catalogue of cometary shapes from the Mawangdui Silk Texts, which includes a swastika-shaped comet, and suggest that some comet drawings were related to the breakup of the progenitor of Encke and the Taurid meteoroid stream. Fred Whipple in his &quot;The Mystery of Comets&quot; (1985, page 163) points out that Comet Encke&#x27;s polar axis is only 5 degrees from its orbital plane: such an orientation is ideal to have presented a pinwheel like aspect to our ancestors when Encke was more active.

Astronomers planned a 2019 search campaign for fragments of comet Encke which would have been visible from Earth as the Taurid swarm passed between July 5–11, and July 21 – August 10. There were no reports of discoveries of any such objects.

==Importance in the scientific history of luminiferous aether==

Comet Encke (and Biela&#x27;s Comet) had a role in scientific history in the generally discredited concept of &quot;luminiferous aether&quot;. As its orbit was perturbed and shortened, the shortening could only be ascribed to the drag of an &quot;ether&quot; through which it orbited in outer space. One reference reads:

:Encke&#x27;s comet is found to lose about two days in each successive period of 1,200 days. Biela&#x27;s comet, with twice that length of period, loses about one day. That is, the successive returns of these bodies is found to be accelerated by this amount. No other cause for this irregularity has been found but the agency of the supposed ether.

Encke&#x27;s pole tumbles in an 81-year period, therefore it will accelerate for half that time, and decelerate for the other half of the time (since the orientation of the comets rotation to solar heating determines how its orbit changes due to outgassing forward or aft of the comet&#x27;s course). The authors of this 1860 textbook of course could not know that the pole of the comet would tumble as it does over such a long period of time, or that outgassing would induce a thrust to change its course.

The supposed shortening of the orbit of Encke&#x27;s Comet demonstrating the existence of ether was mentioned in Edgar Alen Poe&#x27;s story, &quot;The Unparalleled Adventures Of One Hans Pfaall&quot;.

<text>Amberley is a town located in the Hurunui District in north Canterbury, on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It is located on State Highway 1 approximately 50 km north of Christchurch. It is the seat of the Hurunui District Council. The nearest town to the north of Amberly via state highway one is Waipara (11 km) and the nearest town to the south is Leithfield (5.7 km).

== History ==
Amberley was established in 1864 by Mrs. Frederica Josephine Carter who owned freehold land north of the Kowai river. Mrs. Carter subdivided and sold her pastoral run for eight pounds per quarter acre. This price was very attractive as it made the land some of the cheapest in Canterbury. The town was named Amberley after Mrs. Carter&#x27;s family farm in Oxfordshire, England. The earliest residents included a blacksmith, a wheelwright and a carpenter. A courthouse was established in 1870. The town developed slowly at first until the railway, built by Canterbury Provincial Railways, arrived in 1876. With the arrival of the railway, the town grew quickly and a town hall was completed in 1878 which could seat 400 people. The Anglican church was built in 1877 with room for 140 parishioners. It was destroyed by a &quot;hurricane&quot; in 1889 leaving only the tower standing. The church was then rebuilt at a cost of about £700. The Wesleyan church was built in 1882 with room for 120 parishioners. A branch (a two-story building) of the Bank of New South Wales was established in Amberley in 1890. In 1908 a telephone exchange was opened in Amberley. By this time Amberley had 96 houses or other dwellings and was home to more than 800 people.

A decision to install a water supply for Amberley was made in 1953 with the work being completed in 1957. It was deemed a success and considered &quot;the best thing that has ever happened to Amberley&quot;. It was further extended in 1958 and again in 1967. In 1963, planning permission was granted for four shops to be built on Main North Road. This led to other retail businesses moving to Main North Road and further growth in Amberley. Work on a sewage scheme began in 1973. By 1979, around half the properties in Amberley were connected to it.

The Marathon Rubber Footwear factory closed in December 1977 which resulted in 26 redundancies. Amberley was upgraded to an automatic telephone exchange in 1978. By 1986, Amberley had grown to a population of 897 people with a further 144 people living at Amberley Beach.

In early February 2020, a fire at an illegal tyre dump containing 160,000 tyres caused significant air pollution for local residents.

<doc id="480314" wikidata="Q950179" url="?curid=480314" title="European Green Party">
<text>The European Green Party (EGP), also referred to as European Greens, is a transnational, European political party representing national parties from across Europe who share Green values.

The European Greens works closely with the Greens–European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) parliamentary group in the European Parliament which is formed by elected Green party members along with the European Free Alliance, European Pirate Party and Volt Europa. The European Greens&#x27; partners include its youth wing the Federation of Young European Greens (FYEG), the Green European Foundation (GEF) and the Global Greens family.

Green parties participates in the governments of five countries in Europe: Austria (The Greens), Belgium (Groen and Ecolo), Germany (Alliance 90/The Greens), Latvia (The Progressives) and Spain (Catalunya en Comú/Sumar). They also externally support the government in Poland (Zieloni/Civic Coalition).

== Ideology and positions ==
The European Greens have committed themselves to the basic tenets of Green politics as seen across Western Europe, namely environmental responsibility, climate action, individual freedom, inclusive democracy, diversity, social justice, gender equality, global sustainable development and non-violence.

The European Greens was the first party to form out of various national movements to become a European entity, committed to the integration of Europe. The party aims to amplify the views of member parties by having common policy positions, mutual election manifestos, and cohesive European election campaigns. The European Greens also has networks which brings Green politicians together, such as the Local Councillors Network.

=== Charter ===
According to its charter, the European Greens is working towards a just and sustainable transition towards societies &quot;respectful of human rights and built upon the values of environmental responsibility, freedom, justice, diversity and non-violence&quot;. The charter&#x27;s guiding principles provide a framework for the political actions taken by member parties.

The priorities outlined in the charter include protecting human health and wellbeing, maintaining biological diversity, combatting global warming, transitioning to a just and sustainable economy, strengthening inclusive democracies, safeguarding diversity, and ensuring social justice.

== History ==
Green politics in Europe emerged from several grassroots political movements, including the peace movements, the ecology movement and movements for women&#x27;s rights. 

The anti-nuclear movement in Germany first had political expression as Vereinigung Die Grünen, which formed in March 1979, and established itself as a party for the European Parliament in January 1980. Similarly, activists in Britain&#x27;s Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament would eventually form the Ecology Party. However, it also brought in ecological movements, which had become active across Western European nations in the 1970s. Environmental groups became especially political after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, which strengthened groups such as the Italian Green Party. In the Netherlands, feminists dominated GroenLinks party. Elements of all these national parties would go on to form the European Green Party.

Representatives from these and other parties sat in the European Parliament after the 1984 European Parliament election. The following 11 members of this grouping, which was briefly known as the Rainbow Group, came from parties which went on to be part of the European Greens:
* 1 Agalev MEP and 1 Ecolo MEP from Belgium
* 1 Pacifist Socialist MEP and 1 Radicals MEP from the Netherlands
* 7 Grünen MEPs from Germany

The European Green Party itself was officially founded at the 4th Congress of the European Federation of Green Parties on 20–22 February 2004 in Rome. At the convention, 32 Green parties from across Europe joined this new pan-European party. As such, the European Greens became a trans-national party, and the very first European political party.

In the 2004 European Parliament election, member parties won 35 Seats and the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament secured 43 in total.

In the 2009 European Parliament election, even though the European Parliament was reduced in size, the European Greens&#x27; member parties won 46 seats, the best result of the Green Parties in 30 years. The Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament secured 55 seats in total.

In the 2014 European Parliament election, the Green candidates were José Bové and Ska Keller. These elections marked the first time there were primaries including Spitzenkandidaten at the European elections, which allows Europeans to not only vote for who should represent them in the European Parliament, but also help to decide who should lead the European Commission. In May they presented a common programme including the Green New Deal at the launch of the European Greens&#x27; campaign which called for &quot;a new direction of economic policy aimed at reducing our carbon footprint and improving our quality of life&quot;. The slogan of the campaign was &#x27;Change Europe, vote Green&#x27;. The Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament obtained 50 seats in total.

The candidates for the 2019 European Parliament election were Ska Keller and Bas Eickhout, who campaigned for climate protection, a social Europe, more democracy and stronger rule of law. That year, the Greens made the strongest ever showing across Europe, in part due to rising public awareness about climate change and the impact of youth movements for climate. The strongest surge was in Germany as Alliance 90/The Greens replaced the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany as the second-strongest party. The Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament obtained 74 seats in total. The Greens&#x27; results signified a new balance of power as the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) lost their majority.

By 2023, &quot;The Economist&quot; analysed that &quot;the policies espoused by environmentalists sit squarely at the centre of today&#x27;s political agenda&quot;.

Terry Reintke and Bas Eickhout were elected by the European Greens to be lead candidates for the 2024 European Parliament election. The campaign ran under the slogan &quot;Choose Courage&quot;. They were elected by more than 300 delegates at an Extended Congress in Lyon, France in February 2024. The campaign is focused on a Green and Social Deal, and the fight against the rise of the far right in Europe.

At the 2024 Maastricht Debate, organised by &quot;Politico&quot; and the University of Maastricht, European Green top candidate Bas Eickhout asked directly to Ursula von der Leyen, top candidate of the European People&#x27;s Party, what her position was towards the far right in Europe, European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and Identity and Democracy. Von der Leyen told the audience that a collaboration with the ECR &quot;depends very much on how the composition of the Parliament is, and who is in what group.&quot;

Numerous analyses in European quality media consider this as a win for the Greens and the turning point of the 2024 election campaign. The European Greens criticised heavily that von der Leyen, as incumbent president of the European Commission and lead candidate for the EPP, opened the door to collaboration with the far right.

== Organisational structure ==

The European Green Party is a European political party, constituted out of political parties from European countries. Parties can also become associate members. Members of the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament not belonging to a member party can be admitted as a special member with speaking rights but no vote.

*The &quot;Council&quot; takes place twice a year and is the main decision-making body of the European Greens and consists of delegates of member parties. During Councils, delegates from European Greens parties set a common political direction, linked to the development of the European project and its values. They do so by debating and vote on resolutions on key issues in Europe. Delegates are allotted based on their most recent European or national election results. Each party has at least two delegates. consists of delegates of member parties. These are allotted on the basis of their most recent European or national election results.

<doc id="480315" wikidata="Q665969" url="?curid=480315" title="Basel Boys Choir">
<text>The Basel Boys Choir (Knabenkantorei Basel KKB]) is a boys&#x27; choir based in Basel, Switzerland; it grew out of the boys&#x27; choir of the Protestant Church of Basel-City, founded by Hermann Ulbrich in 1927. Today the choir is non-denominational. They sing both sacred and secular works. The choir has been under the leadership of Oliver Rudin since 2017.

In addition, the choir has been invited to participate in important music festivals, including the Lucerne Festival under James Conlon, Mario Venzago, Riccardo Chailly and Mariss Jansons, the European Music Festival in Berlin under Roland Bader, the International Festival of Boys Choirs in Poznań (Poland), as well as festivals in Nancy, Maastricht, Venice, Basel, and the Schubert Choir Festival in Vienna in 1997. The Basel Boys Choir is also the host choir of the well-known and highly successful European Festival of Youth Choirs (&quot;Europäisches Jugendchorfestival, EJCF&quot;).

== Structure ==
The choir consists of approximately 45 unchanged and 35 changed voices. The changed voices are, as a rule, former trebles and altos who have been in the choir for at least a year. The singers dedicate a considerable amount of their free time to the choir: in addition to rehearsals, there are church services, concerts, concert tours, radio and television appearances as well as CD recordings. A choir camp takes place each year for the purpose of learning repertoire.

== Awards ==
* CIMCF 2022 (Men&#x27;s Choir of the KKB): 1. Place, 93/100 Points, Youth Choral Competition
* CIMCF 2022 (Men&#x27;s Choir of the KKB): Winner &quot;Most Entertaining Performance&quot;

== Repertoire ==
The choir&#x27;s a cappella repertoire ranges from Renaissance to contemporary music (Miskinis, Tormis). Performances of oratorios, masses, and cantatas by Bach, Handel, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Britten, and Rossini are the choir&#x27;s main focus. Additionally, the boys&#x27; choir has participated in the Lucerne Festival as well as the following opera performances in Basel: &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Mefistofele&quot;, &quot;Carmen&quot;, &quot;La Bohème&quot;, &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; und &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Soloists from the KKB could also be heard in performances of &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; in theaters in Bern, Basel and Freiburg im Breisgau.

== History ==
=== Founding and first year ===
The founding of the choir goes back to the initiative of the then-school teacher Hermann Ulbrich, who sang in the Basel Bach Choir and attended the Thomanerchor&#x27;s many concerts under Karl Straube in Basel. Ulbrich turned to Ernst Lipp, a fellow singer in the Bach Choir and president of the &quot;Kommission für den Unterricht in der Biblischen Geschichte&quot; (&quot;Commission for the Teaching of Biblical History&quot;, KUBG), and suggested that he found a singing school for the preservation of choral tradition that was in the service of the church, but independent of the YMCA. Lipp passed the idea on to the consistory, where it found little support. Nevertheless, the KUBG approved the charter, which Ulbrich had previously written together with Lipp and YMCA youth secretary Jakob Staehelin, and he took responsibility for the still-to-be-founded choir.

At the beginning of June, 1927, Ulbrich sent out advertising for the &quot;Choirboys of the Protestant Church of Basel-City&quot;, institutionalized in May. On June 15, 1927, the first informational meeting took place with 33 interested boys; this date is taken to be the KKB&#x27;s founding date. The first rehearsal took place on August 19, 1927 in the Bishop&#x27;s residence of the Basel Münster; soon, though, they moved due to the heating problems in the Katharine Chapel of the cloister. The first public appearance occurred on October 30, 1927, as a part of a church service in the Martinskirche, but it was such a fiasco (the 19 boys who did show up sang very poorly) that Ulbrich threatened to resign. Lipp encouraged him to continue, however, and on Christmas, 1927, the choir enthralled the congregation of a church service in the Theodorskirche.

Their third appearance, a Bach concert in April 1928, was also their last before a long summer break, during which a large advertising campaign was carried out to ensure the continued existence of the group. Adolf Hamm, an organist at the Münster, played an important role in the campaign; he ensured that after the successful campaign, the choir, which had grown to 63 boys, was able to perform the Christmas Oratorio for Christmas, 1928, and a Passion concert for Easter, 1929. In August, 1929, a working party was founded on the occasion of the first parents&#x27; evening, and Jakob Staehelin was elected its first president, making him also the first president of the KKB.

In August, 1929, the &quot;Chorschüler der evangelisch-reformierten Kirche Basel-Stadt&quot; (&quot;Choir students of the Protestant Church of Basel-City&quot;), which consisted of former choirboys whose voices had changed, was founded. The expansion of the choir to include changed voices had already been considered by January 1928, but the proposal did not resonate with the older students; the consistory also refused it because of the unintentional competition it would create with the adult community and church choirs. Nevertheless, the choir students appeared at Hamm&#x27;s &quot;Free Organ Recital&quot; in December, 1928, but the group was ultimately unable to survive (for the time being).

On December 22, 1929, the boys&#x27; choir organized their first full concert: a Christmas liturgy at the Münster with the locally renowned soprano Helene Sandreuter, which was a big success.

The quality of the singing, which was still modest in comparison with large boarding school choirs, was such a cause for concern among the choir parents that, after a weak appearance in a church service in Kleinhüningen, they demanded that the choir refrain from further public appearances for the time being. For that reason, the rehearsal time was extended from 75 to 120 minutes and divided into 60 minutes each of singing technique and choir rehearsal after the summer break in 1930. Meanwhile, the choir had grown to 88 boys, which necessitated changing the rehearsal space from St. John&#x27;s Chapel to a larger and considerably more expensive location in Nadelberg by the Peterskirche. In December, 1930, the choir celebrated its 25th appearance. Their quality and proficiency had gradually increased, and soloists were already emerging from the choir.

In 1931, Ulbrich introduced a hierarchical group system inspired by the Scouts; following the Meistersinger model, singers could advance from &quot;Schüler&quot; (beginner) to &quot;Sänger&quot; (singer), and finally &quot;Meister&quot; (master). Additional elements, such as patches and a &quot;Sängerspiegel&quot; (&quot;singer&#x27;s mirror&quot;, equivalent to the Scout Promise) were incorporated. How long this hierarchical group system survived is unknown. However, everyone participated in all of the public appearances. The idea of a choir camp, which originated in 1930, was re-adopted by president Staehelin in 1932, and a camp was held from October 3–13 in Greifensee that year. The fifth anniversary, which occurred in 1932, was celebrated with a large family night with a lottery and singing.

One problem that came up again and again between 1930 and 1933 was the variation in the number of singers and the quality of the choir: Ulbrich was able to keep some of the members of the choir from leaving and train them for some promising performances, but the best singers quickly fell victim to their voices changing and had to leave; meanwhile, Ulbrich needed to recruit and train new boys. Furthermore, Schola Cantorum Basiliensis planned to form a children&#x27;s choir, which meant further competition. For this reason, an &quot;educational department&quot; (now known as &quot;Choir 101&quot;) was created to avoid any further reduction in quality. Talented singers then still came into the choir right away, and the others went through the educational department. A further improvement came in 1933 with vocal training, for which they were able to employ Helene Sandreuter. The rehearsal space was changed from the expensive location in Nadelberg to the church. At the end of the year, Jakob Staehelin stepped down as president due to having to move from Basel; his cousin Hans Staehelin took over his position.

The years leading up to the Second World War were marked by solid efforts for improvement. Ulbrich and Sandreuter, the voice teacher, fell in love and were married on July 11, 1936. Also in 1936, Alfred Courvoisier assumed the presidency. In December, 1938, the choir undertook a half-hour radio program for the first time. The high point of the year, however, had already taken place on May 12, 1938: their participation in the premiere of Arthur Honegger&#x27;s Jeanne d&#x27;Arc au Bûcher at Theater Basel with Ida Rubinstein as Jeanne and the chamber orchestra &quot;Basler Kammerorchester&quot; under the direction of Paul Sacher. A repeat performance with the boys&#x27; choir took place at the Swiss national exposition in Zürich in 1939.

=== Crisis during the Second World War ===
After the outbreak of World War II, rehearing became increasingly more difficult, and in 1940 the rehearsal space changed yet again, first to the City of Basel Music Academy, then to the kindergarten at the Basel Mission. Since Ulbrich had to serve in the military until July, 1940, Emil Herrmann and Helene Sandreuter were entrusted with the interim direction of the choir, leading to temporary cessation of voice lessons. Meanwhile, the size of the choir had shrunk by 25 percent. Ulbrich, who was still on duty, developed a Christmas liturgy with the choir. In 1941, a joint performance with the Schola Cantorum took place. Ernst Lipp, who had been intimately involved with the development of the choir since its founding, died that same year. In 1942 and 1943, interest in joining the choir fell dramatically from its generally high levels, and the choir had only 16 members in May, 1943, who were not of a high enough quality to give a successful concert with the Schola Cantorum at the Barfüsserkirche (&quot;Barefeet Church&quot;). Fortunately, by 1944 the choir had grown back to 30 members. In May, 1945, the choir organized a thanksgiving service on the occasion of the end of the war.

=== Expansion and Ulbrich&#x27;s last year ===
In the years after the war, the number of singers gradually increased. Ulbrich and Sandreuter, now married, could once again fully dedicate themselves to the choirboys. In 1945, the choir was already ready to perform for the premiere of &quot;Unser Vater&quot; by Walter Müller von Kulm with the Bach Choir. In 1949, the choir participated in the 17th &quot;church music day,&quot; organized by the Swiss League of Church Music. In 1950, the minister Alfred Studer replaced Courvoisier as president. That same year, the choir returned to their original rehearsal space, the Bishop&#x27;s residence, where the KKB still rehearses to this day.

On June 22, 1952, the choir celebrated its 25-year anniversary with a special church service in Münster. The composer Rudolf Moser composed a setting of the 29th psalm for the choir. Changed voices, drawn from former trebles and altos, were brought into the choir. The enrollment of new singers was expanded to include students from the second grade and older, allowing them to compete strongly with the Scouts. In 1956, there was another change of president; Studer stepped down because he had to move and handed the position over to the composer Rudolf Moser. In 1959, after the success of a concert with organist Hans Balmer, the choir performed several contemporary works for Swiss radio.

In 1958, the changed voices were finally allowed to join the unchanged voices; the KUBG approved a trial period for their inclusion. A name change was also discussed, but put off until after the trial period. On August 23, 1958, the first rehearsal with eight changed voices took place, and Ulbrich announced in January, 1959, that their inclusion would be made permanent. However, since no tenors could be found until 1962, the deepest boys&#x27; voices and the voices still in the process of changing were used to sing the tenor parts. In 1959, the previously discussed name change finally took place: the choir became the &quot;Evangelische Kantorei Basel&quot; (&quot;Basel Protestant Choir&quot;) and became directly controlled by the consistory.

In 1960, the choir was shaken by President Moser&#x27;s accidental death; his successor was Rudolf Massini. In the 1960s, Ulbrich handed over some of his responsibilities: his wife, Helene Sandreuter, and his son, Markus Ulbrich, along with Kurt Tschirren, an employee in the administration, assisted him in leading the choir, and Markus Ulbrich and Tschirren Kurse worked in the educational department.

In 1967 the &quot;mutant group,&quot; a group of singers undergoing a voice change, was formed with the purpose of productively using the mandatory time off from the choir for vocal training and learning repertoire to better prepare themselves for vocal maturity. Beginning in 1967, the choir started advertising for all elementary school grades. In 1968, the older singers (possibly inspired by the Protests of 1968) demanded the representation in a working committee, which they were finally granted.

=== Establishment as an independent organization ===
In February, 1970, Hermann Ulbrich and Helene Sandreuter announced their resignations from their positions with the choir effective at the end of June. The leadership of the choir was taken over by their son Markus along with two other former choirboys, Kurt Tschirren and Werner Schniepper. Markus Ulbrich placed a heavy emphasis on the works of Heinrich Schütz, with performances of &quot;The Seven Words of Jesus Christ on the Cross&quot; (1791), &quot;St. John Passion&quot; (1972), and &quot;History of the Resurrection&quot; (1974). Tschirren quit in 1972, whereupon Schiepper took over his responsibilities and Hans Peter Oppliger took over Tschirren&#x27;s responsibilities.

Between 1970 and 1972 there was intense discussion regarding how the choir should be legally organized in the future. Various possibilities, including a merger with the YMCA, were seen as disadvantageous. Finally, they decided to establish the choir as an independent organization in order to separate it from the consistory. The foundational meeting took place on February 2, 1972 and resulted in the election of Max Huldi as a replacement for Massini. At the parents&#x27; meeting, yet another name change was decided upon which was in keeping with its recent shift toward Ecumenism and also conveyed its character as a boys&#x27; choir, in spite of the changed voices. This goal was accomplished with the name &quot;Basel Boys Choir&quot; (&quot;Knabenkantorei Basel, KKB&quot;).

The KKB then experienced a tremendous growth: as an independent organization, they were able to ask for financial support from a greater variety of institutions; furthermore, many members and patrons contributed to the improved financial situation, allowing them, for example, to hire more qualified teachers. Public relations were enormously strengthened and improved, and the choir got a logo by holding a public competition. In the summer of 1973, their first concert tour took place in the Bernese Oberland and their first record, a collection of choral and organ works by Felix Mendelssohn, was made. In 1974, a tour of the Netherlands followed with the help of the organist Hans Peter Aeschlimann, and the KKB became a supporting member of the &quot;Gesellschaft für das Gute und Gemeinnützige Basel&quot; (&quot;Society for a Good and Charitable Basel&quot;). Their first television appearances took place in 1975 and 1976 on Südwestrundfunk.

In 1974, the &quot;Gregorian Chant Circle&quot; was founded, which fosters continued training in church music, both for older current choir members as well as alumni. Ulbrich pushed for the improvement of educational opportunities: bassist Stefan Kramp was hired as a voice teacher, and the educational department became &quot;Choir 101&quot;, which it remains today.

In November, 1980, Hermann Ulbrich, the founder of the choir, died at the age of 77; consequently, Markus Ulbrich retired for professional and personal reasons at the end of the year. For the first time, a commission was formed to search for a new choir leader. In the end, the choice was between German cantor Klaus Knall and the leader of the Muttenz youth music school, Beat Raaflaub. The commission unanimously voted for Knall, who took over leadership of the choir in 1981.

=== Turning point and change of director ===
Upon Knall taking over, Schniepper stepped down as administrative director. In 1982, the KKB found itself in deeper financial trouble; the Basel-city canton revoked the KKB&#x27;s subsidies. Klaus Knall himself stepped down at the end of the year for professional reasons as well as a lack of time. Beat Raaflaub, who just two years earlier had lost the position to Knall, became the new musical director. In 1983 and 1984, various sources of support were withdrawn, and as a result the organization had to be restructured: now, the board took direct control over the choir. In 1984, Gerhard Winkler took over the presidency from Max Huldi after he resigned. Benjamin Britten&#x27;s St. Nicolas was performed at Basel&#x27;s Martinskirche and in Reinach, and in June, 1985, the KKB made the first German-language recording of the Britten cantata.

=== Raaflaub&#x27;s leadership ===
In September, 1986, soloists from the KKB participated in a production of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; for the first time at the Theater Basel, and later in Bern and in Freiburg im Breisgau. The boys&#x27; choir participated in the performance of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Eighth Symphony from October 13 to 17 at the Festival of European Music in Berlin under Roland Bader; in November, Mozart&#x27;s Requiem and Grabmusik were performed by the whole choir.

In 1987, the choir held a lavish celebration for its 60-year anniversary: on January 10, the Vienna Boys&#x27; Choir sang a sold out joint performance with the KKB in Basel&#x27;s Stadtcasino. At the end of February, the choir was invited to the &quot;Festival International de Chant Choral&quot; in Nantes. The large jubilee weekend, with choirs from throughout Europe and more than 600 participants from the Basel area, took place on May 16 and 17. This weekend festival can be seen as a kind of pilot project for the European Festival of Youth Choirs (EJCF), which would first take place in 1992. In August, the KKB appeared in the Lucerne Festival and participated in a performance of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Chichester Psalms&quot;. To conclude the year, a tour took place in the Bernese Oberland to commemorate the choir&#x27;s first concert tour.

In November, 1988, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach&#x27;s &quot;Magnificat&quot; and Mozart&#x27;s Coronation Mass were performed. In 1990, the KKB performed with the &quot;Charivari&quot; at the Carnival of Basel, after which they returned to the Theater Basel for a performance of Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, and they also performed Frank Martin&#x27;s &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; in Münster. In May, 1991, the boys&#x27; choir sang on the occasion of the 700 year anniversary session of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland at the Federal Palace of Switzerland in Bern. At the beginning of October, the choir was able to make a scheduled trip to sing in Saint Petersburg, although only weeks before, Mikhail Gorbachev had attempted to stop it.

In 1992, a scheduled three week concert tour of the United States suffered a financial setback as a result of the withdrawal of two large sponsors, and had to be cancelled as a result. In response, it was agreed at the yearly general meeting that a financial reservoir needed to be developed that could weather a bad economy, namely a concert tour endowment. In May, the first European Festival of Youth Choirs took place; the KKB, with Winkler as its business manager and Raaflaub as its musical director, was heavily involved with the planning and execution of the event. In 1993, the choir participated in more than 40 opera performances (including Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; and Boito&#x27;s &quot;Mefistofele&quot;) at the Theater Basel. In May, the US concert tour was able to take place, shortened by a week and accompanied by legislator Hans-Rudolf Striebel. The first KKB concerts outside of Europe took place in such cities as New York and Philadelphia.

In March, 1994, the KKB performed and recorded Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach&#x27;s &quot;St. Mark Passion&quot;, rediscovered in 1985. This was their first globally distributed recording; the double-CD release was distributed by Ars Musici. In April, Gerhard Winkler stepped down as president. His successor was Jürg Rauschenbach. In 1995, the boys&#x27; choir embarked on a concert tour of Germany, traveling through the cities of Ulm, Wiesbaden, Göttingen, Hannover and Frankfurt am Main; the choir also participated in the second EJCF. In 1996, a concert tour through Finland and Estonia took place followed by a choir camp in Turku.

In 1997, the boys&#x27; choir celebrated its 70th year with the premiere performance of Joseph Fitzmartin&#x27;s cantata &quot;Ich möcht&#x27; ein Clown sein&quot; (&quot;I would like to be a clown&quot;, text by Hanns Dieter Hüsch). In April, a celebratory church service took place in Münster, and in May, the choir participated in a youth culture gala in the Stadtcasino Basel with other youth performing groups in the area. To conclude the year, three sold-out performances of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot; took place in November. That same year, assistant director Rolf Herter stepped down; he was replaced by a German director named Johannes Tolle. The anniversary concert tour took place in February 1998, taking the KKB through South Africa for two weeks. In May, the choir participated in the EJCF one more time. In October, Raaflaub was awarded the &quot;Bumberniggel&quot; prize from the anniversary foundation of the UBS AG.

=== Brazilian Tour and Raaflaub&#x27;s last year ===
In 1999, there followed a concert tour through the Czech Republic with appearances in Brno, Hradec Králové, Pardubice, and Prague, as well as performances of Bach&#x27;s Christmas Oratorio in December. In June, 2000, the choir traveled around the German cities of Berlin (with an appearance in the Berlin Cathedral) and Potsdam as well as the Polish city of Poznań, and at the end of the year they performed Mendelssohn&#x27;s Elijah. On January 11, 2001, the boys&#x27; choir took part in a performance of Mahler&#x27;s Eighth Symphony (&quot;Symphony of a Thousand&quot;) involving a thousand performers, including 14 other choirs. Johannes Tolle stepped down as assistant director; he was replaced by Jürg Siegrist, a former member of the choir. In September, the choirboys participated in a performance of Mahler&#x27;s Third Symphony during a Swiss concert series; other engagements at the Lucerne Festival followed in subsequent years. At the end of the year, Britten&#x27;s St. Nicholas cantata was performed in collaboration with &quot;Kantorei St. Arbogast&quot;.

The choir&#x27;s 75 year anniversary was celebrated with a three-week concert tour through Brazil in the summer of 2002. The Brazilian tour was the longest and most successful in the choir&#x27;s history; the KKB was enthusiastically received in 13 cities and reached tens of millions of viewers in an appearance in the city of Riversul, which was broadcast on national television. In the Fall, the choir held its first ten-day choir camp in the former Maloja Palace in the Swiss district of Maloja; originally planned as a one-time camp, the KKB returned to Maloja for its Fall camp every year until 2007. In December, 2002, the KKB performed Handel&#x27;s Coronation Anthems and the Chichester Psalms, choreographed by Parwin Hadinia in the Theater Basel, for its 75th birthday. The concert was so successful that in June, 2003, an extra performance followed in the Schauspielhaus Zürich.

Jürg Rauschenbach, who was intimately involved in the execution and the success of the large concert tours through South Africa and Brasil, stepped down as president in 2002. Kuno Hämisegger, a banker, was chosen as his successor. Around the same time, Rolf Herter, who had resigned as Assistant Director in 1997, returned to former position, which he continues to hold along with Siegrist to this day. In 2003, the KKB took part in the first &quot;Venezia in Musica&quot; international choir festival in Venice and Jesolo and Performed Bach&#x27;s Johannes Passion for Easter, 2004. In May, 2005, a concert tour through Bulgaria took place, during which the choir became the first foreign choir to be allowed perform in the orthodox Easter celebration at Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia. In January and April of that same year, the choir performed the original version of Gioacchino Rossini&#x27;s
&quot;Petite messe solennelle&quot;. In December 2005, an additional performance of Britten&#x27;s cantata &quot;St. Nicolas&quot; and Arthur Honegger&#x27;s A Christmas Cantata with the Basel Girls&#x27; Choir were successfully brought to the stage. Three years of fall concert tours of Germany took the KKB through Calw, Limburg, Göttingen and Rotterdam (Netherlands) in 2004, Nederhof, Wiesbaden, Wirges and Luxembourg in 2006, and Frankfurt (Oder), Saalfeld, Jena, and Sondershausen in 2007.

=== New Director ===
After the concert season was over, Raaflaub announced his resignation, effective February 2007. As in 1980, a search commission was formed. The final choice was Markus Teutschbein. Raaflaub&#x27;s crowning achievement as director of the choir was two sold-out performances of Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s oratorio &quot;St. Paul&quot;. During the months immediately following Raaflaub&#x27;s resignation, assistant director Herter took partial responsibility for leading the choir, while Teutschbein stayed in Germany.

Teutschbein has been the KKB&#x27;s musical director from February 2007 until Autumn 2016, and his first joint project with the choir was to organize the sixth EJCF in May 2007, in Basel. In September, the choir appeared in the &quot;Jugendkulturfestival Basel&quot; (&quot;Basel Youth Culture Festival&quot;) as well as The Glue&#x27;s &quot;Lala Blabla Pomme d&#x27;Adam&quot; Festival. In January 2008, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; was performed with the Berner Freitagsakademie in the original English with great success; in March, there followed a concert tour through Hungary with four more &quot;Messiah&quot; concerts, one of which took place in Matthias Church in Budapest. In the fall, the choirboys participated in an open-air production of Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;. In October 2008, the changed voices performed Luigi Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Requiem in D Minor&quot; for men&#x27;s chorus in the Basel Münster and in the music hall of Stadtcasino Basel; the concert was rounded out by César Franck&#x27;s &quot;Psalm 150&quot; and Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Te Deum&quot;.

Bach&#x27;s St. John Passion was performed three times in March 2009; after two concerts in the Basel Münster and the Arlesheim Dome, the KKB opened its 37th summer concert season in the Bürgel Monastery in Jena. In early summer 2009, a concert tour through France took place. There, the choir performed the Lyon Cathedral in Lyon, as well as in collaboration with the Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc (featured in the movie &quot;Les Choristes&quot;) and gave other performances in Nîmes, Carpentras and Besançon. Shortly thereafter, the KKB appeared in three joint concerts with the Freiburg Cathedral Boys&#x27; Choir and the Chœur de Garçons de Mulhouse.
In 2011 the &quot;Requiem&quot; by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was performed, in 2012 Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;C-Major Mass&quot; followed. In 2014 the Knabenkantorei Basel performed the late version of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;St. Mark Passion&quot; reconstructed by Alexander Grychtolik. In the following year several concerts with the oratorio &quot;Elias&quot; by Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy took place.

From autumn 2016 to summer 2017 Rolf Herter conducted the choir on an interim basis. In summer 2017 Oliver Rudin took over the direction of the choir.

== Partnerships ==
Alongside sporadic collaborations with Theater Basel and various orchestras, such as the Basel Symphony Orchestra and the Basel Sinfonietta, plus ensembles from outside Basel such as the Bern Freitagsakademie, as well as with various guest choirs, there were also regular collaborations with the Basel Girls&#x27; Choir in the past. A collaboration with the Collegium Musicum Basel Orchestra was planned in 2007, but both organizations decided to cancel again in 2009.

<text>SWV (Sisters with Voices) is an American R&amp;B vocal trio from New York City whose members are Cheryl (Coko) Gamble, Tamara (Taj) George, and Leanne (Lelee) Lyons. Formed in 1988 as a gospel group, SWV became one of the most successful R&amp;B groups of the 1990s. They had a series of hits, including &quot;Weak&quot;, &quot;Right Here (Human Nature Remix)&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m So into You&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot;. The group disbanded in 1998 to pursue solo projects and reunited in 2005. 

== Biography ==

=== Early life and big break ===
SWV was formed by founding members Cheryl &quot;Coko&quot; Gamble and Leanne &quot;Lelee&quot; Lyons, with Gamble later recruiting Tamara &quot;Taj&quot; Johnson to join the group along with a fourth member named Samantha, who would eventually leave for unknown reasons. After getting their demo together, their manager at the time, Maureen Singleton sent out demo tapes along with bottles of Perrier (&quot;We couldn&#x27;t afford champagne&quot;, says Taj) to catch the attention of record execs all over America. In 1991, after being invited to sing live in front of RCA executives, SWV was signed to an eight-album record deal.

=== 1992–1995: &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot; and &quot;The Remixes&quot; ===
&quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;, the debut studio album by SWV, was released by RCA Records on October 27, 1992. It was certified multi-platinum by the RIAA for more than two million copies shipped to store.
SWV&#x27;s first single, &quot;Right Here&quot;, was released in the fall of 1992, reaching No. 13 on the R&amp;B charts. Their second single, &quot;I&#x27;m So into You&quot;, peaked at No. 2 on R&amp;B and reached No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The third single, &quot;Weak&quot;, reached No. 1 on both the R&amp;B and Hot 100 charts. &quot;Right Here/Human Nature&quot;, the fourth single and a remix of their first single, &quot;Right Here&quot;, featured samples of Michael Jackson&#x27;s hit &quot;Human Nature&quot;. Pharrell Williams performed a small rap solo on &quot;Right Here (UK Remix)&quot;. &quot;Right Here/Human Nature&quot; peaked at No. 1 on R&amp;B and No. 2 on the Hot 100 and it stayed at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts for 7 weeks, making it one of the longest-running singles of 1993. It was followed up with the additional Top10 R&amp;B hits, &quot;Downtown&quot; (No. 2), and &quot;You&#x27;re Always on My Mind&quot; (No. 8). The album peaked at 8 on the US Billboard 200. Following the success of their first album, SWV appeared on the soundtrack for the 1994 film &quot;Above the Rim&quot;. The single, &quot;Anything&quot;, became a top ten R&amp;B hit and reached No. 18 on the Hot 100 in the spring of 1994. That same year, SWV released &quot;The Remixes&quot;, which went gold by the end of the year. In the summer of 1995, the trio lent vocal harmonies to Blackstreet&#x27;s Top 40 R&amp;B hit &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;. SWV also recorded the track, &quot;All Night Long&quot;, which appeared on the &quot;Waiting to Exhale: Original Soundtrack Album&quot; in late 1995.

=== 1996–1997: &quot;New Beginning&quot;, &quot;Release Some Tension&quot; and &quot;A Special Christmas&quot; ===
Released on April 23, 1996, &quot;New Beginning&quot; was the second album from SWV. The first single, &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot;, became one of their signature songs peaking at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles chart. The second single, &quot;Use Your Heart&quot;, saw the debut of the super producers The Neptunes. This song peaked at twenty-two on the Hot 100 and number six on the R&amp;B chart. The last single, &quot;It&#x27;s All About U&quot;, found Taj taking most of the lead as opposed to Coko. The album was certified platinum for shipping 1,000,000 copies in the U.S. alone.

&quot;Release Some Tension&quot; is SWV&#x27;s third album. It arrived on July 29, 1997. Guest appearances are made by E-40, Puff Daddy, Missy Elliott, Foxy Brown, Lil&#x27; Cease, Lil&#x27; Kim, Snoop Doggy Dogg, and Redman. The album features hits like &quot;Rain&quot; (which samples Jaco Pastorius&#x27;s classic &quot;Portrait of Tracy&quot;), &quot;Someone&quot;, &quot;Can We&quot; (which was originally included on the soundtrack for the Jamie Foxx film &quot;Booty Call&quot;), and canceled single &quot;Lose My Cool&quot;. &quot;Someone&quot;, although featuring one of the biggest producers/artists of the year, Puff Daddy, only reached No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts which sampled The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s &quot;Ten Crack Commandment&#x27;s and Les McCann&#x27;s &quot;Valantra&quot;. &quot;When U Cry&quot; also sampled Tyrone Davis&#x27; &quot;In The Mood&quot;. The album was certified gold for shipping 500,000 copies in the U.S. alone. &quot;A Special Christmas&quot;, a holiday album featuring both cover versions and original material, was released in the United States on November 18, 1997, by RCA Records. &quot;A Special Christmas&quot; would be the penultimate album the trio recorded together before they disbanded the following year.

=== 1998–2010: Hiatus and reuniting of SWV ===
The group split in 1998. Shortly after SWV disbanded, the members began leading their own careers. Coko went on to release her first solo album under RCA, titled &quot;Hot Coko&quot;, in August 1999. The first single, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, which was dedicated to her son Jazz, reached the Top 40 position in the R&amp;B charts that summer. However, neither the album nor the singles gathered the same mainstream success as Coko did with SWV. Coko began working on a second solo album titled &quot;Music Doll&quot; in early 2001, but RCA closed the black music division and the project was shelved. Since then, she has concentrated more on her family. She eventually married gospel producer and drummer for Israel and New Breed, Mike &quot;Big Mike&quot; Clemmons, the father of her second son, Jaylen. She currently resides in Virginia Beach, Virginia. In 2001, Coko and her mother, Lady &quot;Clyde&quot; Tibba Gamble, did a remake of the song &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; (originally recorded by Eric Clapton) on the album &quot;Rhythm and Spirit: &quot;Love Can Build a Bridge&quot;&quot;. The album featured other artists such as Jennifer Holliday, Patti LaBelle, and Tramaine Hawkins. Clemons sang on the Brent Jones &amp; TP Mobb single &quot;Midnite&quot; in 2002. She also appeared on Youthful Praise&#x27;s 2003 gospel album &quot;Thank You for the Change&quot; singing lead on &quot;Up There&quot;.

Coko&#x27;s full gospel solo debut, &quot;Grateful&quot;, was released in the United States on October 31, 2006 and debuted at No. 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Independent albums chart. &quot;Grateful&quot; includes an all-star cover of The Clark Sisters&#x27; &quot;Endow Me&quot; which features R&amp;B singers Faith Evans, Fantasia Barrino and Lil Mo. An alternate version, minus Faith Evans was performed on BET&#x27;s &quot;Celebration of Gospel &#x27;07&quot;. A special edition of &quot;Grateful&quot; only available through Wal-Mart includes two bonus tracks &quot;I Wish&quot; and Brent Jones&#x27; &quot;Midnite&quot; featuring Coko on lead vocals. Coko was reported to have joined an all-black touring cast performing the critically acclaimed play &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, along with Sherri Shepherd, Star Jones, Vanessa L. Williams, and others. Coko performed in Japan for the Billboard Live Tour. She sang some of her solo hits &quot;Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Clap Your Hands&quot;, and the SWV song &quot;Right Here/Human Nature&quot;.
In 2005, SWV reunited and announced plans to record a new album the following year, which did not materialize. In 2007, the group performed dates with After 7, Bobby Brown, New Edition, and Blackstreet. Also in 2007, Taj appeared in the TV One reality series &quot;I Married a Baller&quot; which documented her life with husband Eddie George, former NFL player and present Nashville entrepreneur. SWV members Coko and Lelee (who sing the theme song along with Taj) appear in a couple of the show&#x27;s episodes. On June 24, 2008, during a performance by Alicia Keys at the BET Awards 2008, SWV made a special appearance with the original line up from En Vogue and TLC. SWV sang &quot;Weak&quot; with Alicia and later performed &quot;Waterfalls&quot; with the two other R&amp;B girl groups. Taj was a contestant on &quot;&quot;, in which she came in fourth place. She was blindsided by her former alliance of J.T. Thomas and Stephen Fishbach. She became the sixth Jury Member. She participated in a 2009 national tour of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; with an all-black cast, most of whom are also former reality show contestants. SWV appeared on &quot;The Mo&#x27;Nique Show&quot; on February 2, 2010, performing Patti LaBelle&#x27;s &quot;If Only You Knew&quot;. Lelee and Coko provided the lead vocals.

=== 2011–present: &quot;I Missed Us&quot;, reality show and &quot;Still&quot; ===
In 2011, SWV signed a record deal with Mass Appeal Entertainment and E1 Entertainment. On June 10, SWV was featured on the official remix of Chris Brown&#x27;s remake of their &quot;Right Here/Human Nature&quot; song, &quot;She Ain&#x27;t You&quot;. SWV released &quot;Co-Sign&quot; on December 15, 2011, via iTunes as the first single from their fourth studio album, &quot;I Missed Us&quot;. VH1 ranked SWV No. 88 on their 100 Greatest: Women in Music list. &quot;Billboard&quot; named SWV the No. 7 R&amp;B Act and the No. 2 Top Selling/Airplay R&amp;B Female Group of the 1990s. The track listing for SWV&#x27;s &quot;I Missed Us&quot; was released on Amazon.com. The album was released on April 17, 2012, via eOne Music and Mass Appeal Entertainment.

SWV appeared on the television talk show &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot; on April 17, 2012, to promote the release of &quot;I Missed Us&quot; and to perform the hit song &quot;Co-Sign&quot;. The album then went to No. 1 on the iTunes R&amp;B albums chart. On June 1, 2012, SWV announced that their next single from &quot;I Missed Us&quot; would be &quot;Love Unconditionally&quot;. On June 28, 2012, the song &quot;I&#x27;m So into You&quot; from the triple-platinum album &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot; was ranked at No. 18 on VH1&#x27;s 40 Greatest R&amp;B Songs of the &#x27;90s.

On November 4, 2012, SWV performed on Black Girls Rock!, an organization founded to inspire young black girls, on BET. On July 7, 2013, during the Essence Music Festival, SWV announced that We tv green-lit a reality series that would detail their lives as a group and individually, professionally and personally. It would also address their 1998 breakup and their subsequent reunion. &quot;SWV Reunited&quot; premiered on January 16, 2014, with a six-episode season. A twelve-episode second season followed later that August. As promised, the show has documented the trust issues the groupmates have with one another from their acrimonious split and their attempt to rebuild their friendships and their brand. It also showcased their professional endeavors and struggles, including touring and recording a comeback album, trying to get out of a record contract and disputes with their road manager, Cory Taylor. Subplots included Coko&#x27;s reluctance to record secular music after her foray into gospel, Taj&#x27;s health issues and Lelee&#x27;s tumultuous relationship with her daughter. A song that the group was shown recording on &quot;SWV Reunited&quot;, titled &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Man&quot;, was released to iTunes as a promotional single on August 7, 2015.

On November 6, 2015, it was officially announced via Coko&#x27;s official Instagram account that &quot;SWV Reunited&quot; had been canceled by WE tv. In the same post, she stated that SWV&#x27;s long-delayed fifth studio album would be titled &quot;Still&quot; and was set to be released on February 5, 2016. On December 10, 2015, while making a surprise appearance on the television talk show, The View, Taj announced that &quot;Still&quot; was available for pre-order along with that came a second single titled &quot;MCE (Man Crush Everyday)&quot;.

In 2017, SWV collaborated with Bell Biv DeVoe on the song &quot;Finally&quot; which was released as the second single off their album &quot;Three Stripes&quot;. They were also awarded the &quot;Lady of Soul Award&quot; at the 2017 Soul Train Music Awards.

In 2019, SWV announced they had partnered with hip-hop trio Salt-N-Pepa in the creation of a new reality series called &quot;Ladies Night&quot;. The show premiered on BET on April 30, 2019.

As part of their virtual artist battles birthed in 2020, Verzuz hosted a pre-Mother&#x27;s day event, featuring both SWV and Xscape, on May 8, 2021. Both DJs, AONE and Spinderella, were responsible for music play for both groups.

<doc id="480325" wikidata="Q446670" url="?curid=480325" title="Carlo Bergonzi (tenor)">
<text>Carlo Bergonzi (13 July 1924 – 25 July 2014) was an Italian operatic tenor. Although he performed and recorded some bel canto and verismo roles, he was above all associated with the operas of Giuseppe Verdi, including many of the composer&#x27;s lesser known works he helped revive. He sang more than forty other roles throughout his career.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Bergonzi was born in Polesine Parmense, near Parma in Northern Italy, on 13 July 1924. He was an only child. He later claimed he saw his first opera, Verdi’s &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, when he was six years old. He sang in church, and soon he began to appear in children&#x27;s opera roles in Busseto, a nearby town. After he left school at age 11 he began working in a parmesan cheese factory. His father worked there too, and Carlo often got into trouble for singing.

At the age of 16, he began his vocal studies as a baritone at Arrigo Boito Conservatory in Parma with Ettore Campogalliani and Edmondo Grandini.

During World War II, Bergonzi became involved in anti-Nazi activities and was interned in a German prisoner-of-war camp in 1943. Two years later, he was freed by the Russians and walked 106 km in order to reach an American camp. However, while on his way, he drank unboiled water and contracted typhoid fever, from which he recovered within a year. After the war he returned to the Arrigo Boito Conservatory in Parma, weighing just over 36 kilograms (80 pounds).

===Operatic career===
In a 1985 interview with &quot;Opera Fanatic&quot;&#x27;s Stefan Zucker, Bergonzi cited 1948 as the year of his professional debut, as a baritone. He sang the role of Figaro in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, which he performed with a former prisoners&#x27; association which he joined after the war. It has been noted that the fee of 2,000 lire paid for his professional debut was insufficient to cover his meals and travel.

Other baritone roles which he undertook included those of Metifio in &quot;L&#x27;arlesiana&quot;, Doctor Malatesta in &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;, Belcore in &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;, Enrico Ashton in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; , Ghirlino in &quot;Le astuzie di Bertoldo&quot;, Silvio in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, David in &quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot;, Alfio in &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, Albert in &quot;Werther&quot;, Marcello in &quot;La bohème&quot;, Sonora in &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;, Sharpless in &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, Lescaut in &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, Laerte in &quot;Mignon&quot;, the title role in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, and Georgio Germont in &quot;La traviata&quot;.

However, he realized that the tenor repertoire was more suited to his voice, and after retraining, he made his debut as a tenor in the title role of &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; at the Teatro Petruzzelli in Bari in 1951. That same year, Bergonzi sang at the Coliseum in Rome in a 50th anniversary concert of Verdi&#x27;s death and the Italian state radio network RAI engaged Bergonzi for a series of broadcasts of the lesser-known Verdi operas for the same purpose. These included &quot;I due Foscari&quot; as well as &quot;Giovanna d&#x27;Arco&quot; and &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;.
In 1953, Bergonzi made his La Scala debut, creating the title role in Jacopo Napoli&#x27;s opera &quot;Mas&#x27; Aniello&quot; which was based on the life of Tommaso Aniello, the 17th-century Italian fisherman-turned-revolutionary. His London debut as Alvaro in &quot;La forza del destino&quot; took place at the Stoll Theatre in 1953. His American debut was at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1955, and his Metropolitan Opera debut as Radamès in &quot;Aida&quot; came on 13 November 1956 when he (and Antonietta Stella) received a positive reaction from Howard Taubman in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Bergonzi continued to sing at the Met for 32 years, his last performance there occurring on 12 November 1988 in the role of Edgardo in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;.

He sang the role of Radames again for his debut with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company in 1961 and in 1962 he reprised the role of Alvaro for his debut with the Royal Opera, Covent Garden. He made his debut with the San Francisco Opera in 1969 as Don Alvaro in &quot;La forza del destino&quot;.

Bergonzi pursued a busy international career in the opera house and recording studio during the 1960s. His chief Italian tenor rivals in this period were Franco Corelli and Mario Del Monaco. Bergonzi outlasted both, continuing to sing through the 1970s at major opera houses. But in the 1980s, as his own vocal quality deteriorated inevitably with age, he concentrated on recital work. In 1996, Bergonzi participated in conductor James Levine&#x27;s 25th anniversary gala at the Metropolitan Opera. He gave his American farewell concert at Carnegie Hall on 17 April that same year.

However, an announcement that on 3 May 2000, he was to sing the title role in a concert performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;, conducted by Eve Queler and the Opera Orchestra of New York, attracted intense interest, particularly because he had never performed the demanding role on stage. Amongst others, the audience included Anna Moffo, Licia Albanese, Sherrill Milnes, José Carreras, Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. Bergonzi was unable to finish the performance, supposedly suffering irritation from the air-conditioning in his dressing room. He withdrew after two acts, leaving the remaining two to be sung by Antonio Barasorda, a substitute singer. This performance was by wide critical consensus seen as a disaster.

After retiring, Bergonzi is credited with mentoring tenors Roberto Aronica, Giuliano Ciannella, Berle Sanford Rosenberg, Vincenzo La Scola, Filippo Lo Giudice, Philip Webb, Giorgio Casciari, Paul Caragiulo, Lance Clinker, Fernando del Valle, Salvatore Licitra and Emmanuel Lawler. Soprano Frances Ginsberg was also one of his pupils.

Bergonzi left a legacy of many recordings of individual arias and complete operas, including works by Verdi, Puccini, Mascagni and Leoncavallo. However, of his early baritone roles, few of his audio recordings still exist.

===Summary of his vocal attributes===
In &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary, Peter G. Davis, who reviewed a 1978 Carnegie Hall recital by Bergonzi in &quot;The Times&quot; is quoted as noting:
:More than the sound of the voice, it is Mr. Bergonzi&#x27;s way of using it that is so special. He is a natural singer in that everything he does seems right and inevitable—the artful phrasing, the coloristic variety, the perfectly positioned accents, the theatrical sense of well-proportioned climaxes, the honest emotional fervor. Best of all, Mr. Bergonzi obviously uses these effects artistically because he feels them rather than intellectualizes them—a rare instinctual gift, possibly the most precious one any musician can possess.

Alan Blyth, in his &quot;Gramophone&quot; survey of Bergonzi&#x27;s greatest recordings, sums up the qualities of Bergonzi&#x27;s voice:
:His singing there [referring to an online example], even more his earlier Verdi discs, evinces an innate feeling for shaping a line on a long breath, an exemplary clarity of diction, words placed immaculately on the tone, an authoritative use of portamento and acuti. Add to those virtues the manner by which he gives to each phrase a sense of inevitability and you say to yourself, in a mood of sheer pleasure, this is exactly how the music ought to sound. In the theatre only Otello was beyond his capabilities, though his solos are movingly sung on the Philips set.

===Personal life===
In 1950 Bergonzi married Adele Aimi, with whom he had two sons, Maurizio and Marco; the former was born on the day Bergonzi made his tenor debut. Bergonzi owned homes in both Milan and Busseto, in addition to a restaurant and hotel in the latter, the &quot;I Due Foscari&quot;, named after the Verdi opera about Venetian court intrigue.

===Death===
Bergonzi died on 25 July 2014, twelve days after his 90th birthday, in the Auxologico Institution in Milan. He was buried in the Vidalenzo Cemetery.

<text>A National Institute for Higher Education (NIHE) () was a category of higher education institution established in Ireland to provide higher level technical education above the standard of the then established Regional Technical College system, at university level. Higher level technical education in Ireland was seen to be an area that was poorly served until the advent of these institutions.

The plan was to see degree level education mainly. The first institution was set up in Limerick, where there had been long-standing demand for a university, in fact a &quot;University of Limerick&quot; was proposed &quot;inter alia&quot; in the late 1960s by the &quot;Lichfield Report&quot;. The institution at Dublin was to be the unified campus of what later became Dublin Institute of Technology, but instead a new institution was developed similar to Limerick.

In the 1970s it was expected that the institutions would be &quot;recognised colleges&quot; of the National University of Ireland, in time this status been raised to &quot;constituent college&quot; status. Initially this did occur for a short time (1976–1977), however the institutions had all degrees conferred by the National Council for Educational Awards after 1977, this continued until university status was achieved.
==International Study Group on Technological Education==

In November 1986 the International Study Group on Technological Education was established by the Minister for Education.

The chair was T.P. Hardiman, chairman of the Investment Bank of Ireland, whilst the deputy chair was Emeritus Professor of Business Administration at University College Dublin. The other three members were:
*Vice-Chancellor of Brunel University and Vice President of the Royal Society
*President of the University of Waterloo
*Vice-President of the German Research Foundation at Hamburg University of Technology

The institutions were de facto universities from the start, and were elevated to the level of university in 1989 after the &quot;International Study Group on Technological Education&quot; presented its recommendations to the Irish Government on their status. The original brief of this report was to investigate the creation of a single &quot;National Technological University&quot;:

:&quot;...to examine third-level technological education outside the universities and to consider the case of a new Technological University...&quot;

However the study group found that this title would not be appropriate considering that non-technical disciplines were offered and that one university might limit the innovation which had become the trademark of the two separate institutions:

:&quot;...the NIHE Limerick having the title University of Limerick and the NIHE Dublin having the title Dublin City University or the University of Leinster.&quot;

:&quot;The title &#x27;technological university&quot; should not be used.&quot;

<doc id="480331" wikidata="Q213889" url="?curid=480331" title="Siamang">
<text>The siamang (, ; Symphalangus syndactylus) is an endangered arboreal, black-furred gibbon native to the forests of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The largest of the gibbons, the siamang can be twice the size of other gibbons, reaching in height, and weighing up to . It is the only species in the genus Symphalangus. Fossils of siamangs date back to the Middle Pleistocene.

Two features distinguish the siamang from other gibbons. First, two digits on each foot—the second and third toes—are partially joined by a membrane, hence the specific name &quot;syndactylus&quot;, from the Ancient Greek σύν, &quot;sun-&quot;, &quot;with&quot; + δάκτυλος, &quot;daktulos&quot;, &quot;finger&quot;. Second, a large gular sac (throat pouch), found in both males and females of the species, can be inflated to the size of the siamang&#x27;s head, allowing it to make resonating calls.

Two subspecies of the siamang are the nominate Sumatran siamang (&quot;S. s. syndactylus&quot;) and the Malaysian siamang (&quot;S. s. continentis&quot;, in Malay Peninsula). Otherwise, the Malaysian individuals are only a population. The siamang occurs sympatrically with other gibbons; its two ranges are entirely within the combined ranges of the agile gibbon and the lar gibbon.

The siamang can live to around 40 years in captivity.

While the illegal pet trade takes a toll on wild populations, the principal threat to the siamang is habitat loss in both Indonesia and Malaysia. The palm oil production industry is clearing large swaths of forest, reducing the habitat of the siamang, along with those of other species, such as the Sumatran tiger.

== Description ==

The siamang has long, dense, shaggy hair, which is the darkest shade of all gibbons. The ape&#x27;s long, gangling arms are longer than its legs. The average length of a siamang is 90 cm; the largest they have ever grown is 150 cm. The face of this large gibbon is mostly hairless, apart from a thin mustache.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The siamang inhabits the forest remnants of Sumatra Island and the Malay Peninsula, and is widely distributed from lowland forest to mountain forest—even rainforest—and can be found at altitudes up to 3800 m. It lives in groups of up to six individuals (four individuals on average) with an average home range of 23 hectares. Their day ranges are substantially smaller than those of sympatric &quot;Hylobates&quot; species, often less than 1 km. The siamang&#x27;s melodious singing breaks the forest&#x27;s silence in the early morning after the agile gibbons&#x27; or lar gibbons&#x27; calls. The siamangs in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula are similar in appearance, but some behaviors differ between the two populations.

== Ecology and behavior ==
Siamangs have an ecology and relationship between two types of gibbons that share the same habitat. Those include the Agile gibbon and Lar gibbon. Both of the gibbons that live with the siamangs are Hylobates rather than Symphalangus. When two siamangs meet, they often have a bond with each other. They might also communicate by using their throat pouches and shouts to communicate when they feel excited, relaxed, trying to mate, or threatened. If siamangs use loud sounds, they also use body language to communicate. They use sign language or pointing to make others aware of what they need or what they want to do.
=== Diet ===
The siamang eats mainly various parts of plants. The Sumatran siamang is more frugivorous than its Malayan relative, with fruit making up to 60% of its diet. The siamang eats at least 160 species of plants, from vines to woody plants. Its major food source is figs (&quot;Ficus&quot; spp.). The siamang prefers to eat ripe rather than unripe fruit, and young rather than old leaves. It eats flowers and a few animals, mostly insects. When the siamang eats large flowers, it eats only the corollae (petals), but it eats all parts of smaller flowers, with the small fruit collected in its hand before being consumed. When it eats big and hard seeds or seeds with sharp edges, it peels out the fruit flesh and throws away the seed. Although its diet consists of substantial portions of fruit, it is the most folivorous of all members of Hylobatidae. As it is also the largest gibbon, it fits well with the general primate dietary trend in which larger primates tend to be more folivorous.

=== Demography and population ===
A group of siamangs normally consists of an adult dominant male, an adult dominant female, with offspring, infants, and sometimes a subadult. The subadult usually leaves the group after attaining the age of 6–8 years; subadult females tend to leave the group earlier than subadult males. Siamang gestation period is between 6.2 and 7.9 months; after the infant is born, the mother takes care of the infant for the first year of its life. Siamang males tend to offer more paternal care than do other members of the family Hylobatidae, taking up a major role in carrying an infant after it is about 8 months old. The infant typically returns to its mother to sleep and nurse. The infant begins to travel independently from its parents by its third year of life.

Siamangs are generally known to have monogamous mating pairs, which have been documented to spend more time in close proximity to each other, in comparison to other gibbon species. Both monogamous and polyandrous groups, though, are found in South Sumatra. In studying these populations, infants belonging to monogamous groups were found to receive more overall male care than infants in the polyandrous groups. This reduced care is most likely due to reduced certainty of paternity in these groups.

Habitat disturbance affects siamang group composition; it is varied in age-sex structure between intact forest and burnt, regrown forest. The burnt, regrown forest population contained more adult and subadults than the intact forest population, which had more infants, small juveniles, and large juveniles. Infant survival rates in burnt, regrown forest groups are lower than in intact forest groups. The number of individuals in the latter is higher than in the former. The siamang in disturbed forests live in small groups and have a density lower than in intact forests because of lack of food resources and trees for living.

In the 1980s, the Indonesian population of the siamang in the wild was estimated to be 360,000 individuals. This figure may be less in the 21st century: Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park is the third-largest protected area () in Sumatra, of which roughly remain under forest cover inhabited by 22,390 siamangs (in 2002 censuses). In Sumatra, the siamang prefers to inhabit lowland forest between above sea level.

=== Behavior ===
The siamang tends to rest for more than half of its waking period from dawn to dusk, followed by feeding, moving, foraging, and social activities. It takes more rest during midday, taking time to groom others or to play. During resting time, it usually uses a branch of a large tree, lying on its back or belly. Feeding behaviors, foraging, and moving are most often in the morning and after resting. Grooming is one of the most important social interactions among family members. Grooming takes place between adults earlier in the day; the adults groom the juveniles later in the day. Adult males are the most involved in grooming.
In the dry season, the size of the siamang&#x27;s daily range is larger than in the rainy season. The siamang in southern Sumatra spends less time foraging than siamangs in other places, as it eats a diet higher in fruit. It thus consumes more nutrients, which results in less time needed for food acquisition. A siamang may spend an entire day in a single fruiting tree, moving out when it wants to rest and returning to feed.

Siamangs are a very social species of primates and exhibit a variety of tactile and visual gestures, along with actions and facial expressions to communicate and increase social bonds within their family group. They are also territorial, and interact with other family groups by making loud calls to let other groups know where their territory is. The calls may be asynchronous, where they are not directed at a particular neighbouring group, or simultaneous group calls may take place across the territory boundary. Males are known to chase one another across the boundary.
Grooming frequency between males and females has been found to correlate to copulation frequency, as well as bouts of aggression. Pairs copulate over four to five months at intervals of two to three years. The peak of their reproductive activity is often during the time when fruit is most abundant. Dorsoventral copulation is the most common type in siamangs, where the female is squatting and the male hangs by his arms and grips the female with his legs, whereas ventroventral copulation, where both primates are suspended, occurs only one in 60 times on average.

=== Role of calling ===


The siamang starts its day by calling in the early morning; it calls less after midday, with the peak of the calls around 9:00 to 10:00 am. Most of the siamang&#x27;s calls are directed to its neighbours rather than to those inside its home range. This means the siamang&#x27;s calling is in response to disturbances and to defend its territory. Calls in the late morning typically happen when it meets or sees another siamang group. The edge of the siamang&#x27;s home range, which may overlap another, is often the place where calling is made. Counter (co-response) calling occasionally happens near the border or in the overlap area. Calls are numerous when fruit is more abundant rather than when it is less available. Branch shaking, swinging, and moving around the tree crowns accompany the calling. This movement might be to show the other groups where they are.

The siamang prefers calling in the living, tall, and big trees, possibly where another group is easy to see. Besides that, such trees can support siamang movement. Calling trees are usually near feeding trees, but sometimes they call in the feeding trees.

Mated pairs produce loud, well-patterned calling bouts, which are referred to as duetting. These calls advertise the presence and status of a mated pair. Newly formed pairs spend more time singing than an established pair. Advertising the presence of a strong bond is advantageous in territorial defense. Siamang duetting differs from other species because it has a particularly complex vocal structure. Four distinct classes of vocalizations have been documented: booms, barks, ululating screams, and bitonal screams. Females typically produce long barks and males generally produce bitonal screams, but both sexes have been known to produce all four classes of vocalizations. Unlike other gibbons in which vocalization is added by laterally expanded laryngeal sacs, those in siamangs fuse with each other and extend into the ventral area of the neck. 

=== Seeding ===
As a frugivorous animal, the siamang disperses seeds through defecation as it travels across its territory. The siamang can carry seed while digesting, and defecate between from the seed resource, which supports the forest&#x27;s regeneration and succession.

==Threats and conservation==
As an arboreal primate whose survival absolutely depends on the forest, the siamang faces population pressure due to habitat loss, poaching, and hunting.

===Habitat loss===
A major threat to the siamang is habitat fragmentation due to plantations, forest fire, illegal logging, , and human development. Firstly, palm-oil plantations have removed large areas of the siamang&#x27;s habitat in recent decades. Since 2002, 107,000 km2 of oil palm have been planted, which has replaced much rainforest in Indonesia and Malaysia, where the siamang originally lived. Secondly, in the second decade of the 21st century, forests in the Malay Peninsula have been destroyed due to illegal logging. Sixteen out of the 37 permanent forest reserves in Kelantan, in the Malay Peninsula, where most of the siamangs live, have been encroached upon by illegal loggers. Thirdly, forest encroachments change forest cover into cultivated land; for example, the rising price of coffee in 1998 encouraged people in Sumatra to replace the forest with coffee plantations. Fourthly, development in many areas requires infrastructure, such as roads, which now divide conservation areas and have caused forest fragmentation and edge effects.

=== Poaching and hunting ===
Unlike other parts of Asia, primates are not hunted for their meat in Indonesia. They are hunted for the illegal pet trade, with hunters preferring infant siamangs. Poachers often kill the mothers first, since siamang females are highly protective of their infants, and removing the infant without first killing the mother requires more effort. Most siamangs on the market are infants, which often die during transportation.

<doc id="480335" wikidata="Q5469970" url="?curid=480335" title="Formal group law">
<text>In mathematics, a formal group law is (roughly speaking) a formal power series behaving as if it were the product of a Lie group. They were introduced by . The term formal group sometimes means the same as formal group law, and sometimes means one of several generalizations. Formal groups are intermediate between Lie groups (or algebraic groups) and Lie algebras. They are used in algebraic number theory and algebraic topology.

==Definitions==
A one-dimensional formal group law over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; is a power series &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) with coefficients in &quot;R&quot;, such that 
# &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; + terms of higher degree
# &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;F&quot;(&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;)) = &quot;F&quot;(&quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;), &quot;z&quot;) (associativity).
The simplest example is the additive formal group law &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;.
The idea of the definition is that &quot;F&quot; should be something like the formal power series expansion of the product of a Lie group, where we choose coordinates so that the identity of the Lie group is the origin.

More generally, an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional formal group law is a collection of &quot;n&quot; power series
&quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;y&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;2, ..., &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot;) in 2&quot;n&quot; variables, such that 
# F(x,y) = x + y + terms of higher degree
# F(x, F(y,z)) = F(F(x,y), z)
where we write F for (&quot;F&quot;1, ..., &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;), x for (&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;), and so on.

The formal group law is called commutative if F(x,y) = F(y,x). If &quot;R&quot; is torsionfree, then one can embed &quot;R&quot; into a Q-algebra and use the exponential and logarithm to write any one-dimensional formal group law &quot;F&quot; as &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = exp(log(&quot;x&quot;) + log(&quot;y&quot;)), so &quot;F&quot; is necessarily commutative. More generally, we have:
:Theorem. Every one-dimensional formal group law over &quot;R&quot; is commutative if and only if &quot;R&quot; has no nonzero torsion nilpotents (i.e., no nonzero elements that are both torsion and nilpotent).
There is no need for an axiom analogous to the existence of inverse elements for groups, as this turns out to follow automatically from the definition of a formal group law. In other words we can always find a (unique) power series G such that F(x,G(x)) = 0.

A homomorphism from a formal group law F of dimension &quot;m&quot; to a formal group law G of dimension &quot;n&quot; is a collection f of &quot;n&quot; power series in &quot;m&quot; variables, such that
::G(f(x), f(y)) = f(F(x,y)).
A homomorphism with an inverse is called an isomorphism, and is called a strict isomorphism if in addition f(x) = x + terms of higher degree. Two formal group laws with an isomorphism between them are essentially the same; they differ only by a &quot;change of coordinates&quot;.

==Examples==
*The additive formal group law is given by
:: formula_1
*The multiplicative formal group law is given by
:: formula_2
:This rule can be understood as follows. The product &quot;G&quot; in the (multiplicative group of the) ring &quot;R&quot; is given by &quot;G&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) = &quot;ab&quot;. If we &quot;change coordinates&quot; to make 0 the identity by putting &quot;a&quot; = 1 + &quot;x&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = 1 + &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;G&quot; = 1 + &quot;F&quot;, then we find that &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; + &quot;xy&quot;.
Over the rational numbers, there is an isomorphism from the additive formal group law to the multiplicative one, given by . Over general commutative rings &quot;R&quot; there is no such homomorphism as defining it requires non-integral rational numbers, and the additive and multiplicative formal groups are usually not isomorphic.

*More generally, we can construct a formal group law of dimension &quot;n&quot; from any algebraic group or Lie group of dimension &quot;n&quot;, by taking coordinates at the identity and writing down the formal power series expansion of the product map. The additive and multiplicative formal group laws are obtained in this way from the additive and multiplicative algebraic groups. Another important special case of this is the formal group (law) of an elliptic curve (or abelian variety).
*&quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;)/(1 + &quot;xy&quot;) is a formal group law coming from the addition formula for the hyperbolic tangent function: tanh(&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;F&quot;(tanh(&quot;x&quot;), tanh(&quot;y&quot;)), and is also the formula for addition of velocities in special relativity (with the speed of light equal to 1).
*formula_3 is a formal group law over Z[1/2] found by Euler, in the form of the addition formula for an elliptic integral ():

:: formula_4

==Lie algebras==

Any &quot;n&quot;-dimensional formal group law gives an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Lie algebra over the ring &quot;R&quot;, defined in terms of the quadratic part &quot;F&quot;2 of the formal group law. 
:[&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;] = &quot;F&quot;2(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) − &quot;F&quot;2(&quot;y&quot;,&quot;x&quot;)
The natural functor from Lie groups or algebraic groups to Lie algebras can be factorized into a functor from Lie groups to formal group laws, followed by taking the Lie algebra of the formal group:
::Lie groups → Formal group laws → Lie algebras

Over fields of characteristic 0, formal group laws are essentially the same as finite-dimensional Lie algebras: more precisely, the functor from finite-dimensional formal group laws to finite-dimensional Lie algebras is an equivalence of categories. Over fields of non-zero characteristic, formal group laws are not equivalent to Lie algebras. In fact, in this case it is well-known that passing from an algebraic group to its Lie algebra often throws away too much information, but passing instead to the formal group law often keeps enough information. So in some sense formal group laws are the &quot;right&quot; substitute for Lie algebras in characteristic &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0.

==The logarithm of a commutative formal group law==

If F is a commutative &quot;n&quot;-dimensional formal group law over a commutative Q-algebra &quot;R&quot;, then it is strictly isomorphic to the additive formal group law. In other words, there is a strict isomorphism f from the additive formal group to F, called the logarithm of F, so that 
::f(F(x,y)) = f(x) + f(y).

Examples:
*The logarithm of &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; is &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;.
*The logarithm of &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; + &quot;xy&quot; is &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = log(1 + &quot;x&quot;), because log(1 + &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; + &quot;xy&quot;) = log(1 + &quot;x&quot;) + log(1 + &quot;y&quot;).

If &quot;R&quot; does not contain the rationals, a map f can be constructed by extension of scalars to &quot;R&quot; ⊗ Q, but this will send everything to zero if &quot;R&quot; has positive characteristic. Formal group laws over a ring &quot;R&quot; are often constructed by writing down their logarithm as a power series with coefficients in &quot;R&quot; ⊗ Q, and then proving that the coefficients of the corresponding formal group over &quot;R&quot; ⊗ Q actually lie in &quot;R&quot;. When working in positive characteristic, one typically replaces &quot;R&quot; with a mixed characteristic ring that has a surjection to &quot;R&quot;, such as the ring &quot;W&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) of Witt vectors, and reduces to &quot;R&quot; at the end.

=== The invariant differential ===
When &quot;F&quot; is one-dimensional, one can write its logarithm in terms of the invariant differential ω(t). Let formula_5where formula_6 is the free formula_7-module of rank 1 on a symbol &quot;dt&quot;. Then ω is &quot;translation&quot; &quot;invariant&quot; in the sense that formula_8where if we write formula_9, then one has by definitionformula_10If one then considers the expansion formula_11, the formulaformula_12defines the logarithm of &quot;F&quot;.

==The formal group ring of a formal group law==

The formal group ring of a formal group law is a cocommutative Hopf algebra analogous to the group ring of a group and to the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra, both of which are also cocommutative Hopf algebras. In general cocommutative Hopf algebras behave very much like groups.

For simplicity we describe the 1-dimensional case; the higher-dimensional case is similar except that notation becomes more involved.

Suppose that &quot;F&quot; is a (1-dimensional) formal group law over &quot;R&quot;. Its formal group ring (also called its hyperalgebra or its covariant bialgebra) is a cocommutative Hopf algebra &quot;H&quot; constructed as follows.
* As an &quot;R&quot;-module, &quot;H&quot; is free with a basis 1 = &quot;D&quot;(0), &quot;D&quot;(1), &quot;D&quot;(2), ...
*The coproduct Δ is given by Δ&quot;D&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = Σ&quot;D&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) ⊗ &quot;D&quot;(&quot;n&quot;−&quot;i&quot;) (so the dual of this coalgebra is just the ring of formal power series).
*The counit &quot;η&quot; is given by the coefficient of &quot;D&quot;(0).
*The identity is 1 = &quot;D&quot;(0).
*The antipode &quot;S&quot; takes &quot;D&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) to (−1)&quot;n&quot;&quot;D&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).
*The coefficient of &quot;D&quot;(1) in the product &quot;D&quot;(&quot;i&quot;)&quot;D&quot;(&quot;j&quot;) is the coefficient of &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;y&quot;&quot;j&quot; in &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;).

Conversely, given a Hopf algebra whose coalgebra structure is given above, we can recover a formal group law &quot;F&quot; from it. So 1-dimensional formal group laws are essentially the same as Hopf algebras whose coalgebra structure is given above.

==Formal group laws as functors==

Given an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional formal group law F over &quot;R&quot; and a commutative &quot;R&quot;-algebra &quot;S&quot;, we can form a group F(&quot;S&quot;) whose underlying set is &quot;N&quot;&quot;n&quot; where &quot;N&quot; is the set of nilpotent elements of &quot;S&quot;. The product is given by using F to multiply elements of &quot;N&quot;&quot;n&quot;; the point is that all the formal power series now converge because they are being applied to nilpotent elements, so there are only a finite number of nonzero terms.
This makes F into a functor from commutative &quot;R&quot;-algebras &quot;S&quot; to groups.

We can extend the definition of F(&quot;S&quot;) to some topological &quot;R&quot;-algebras. In particular, if &quot;S&quot; is an inverse limit of discrete &quot;R&quot; algebras, we can define F(&quot;S&quot;) to be the inverse limit of the corresponding groups. For example, this allows us to define F(Z&quot;p&quot;) with values in the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers.

The group-valued functor of F can also be described using the formal group ring &quot;H&quot; of F. For simplicity we will assume that F is 1-dimensional; the general case is similar. For any cocommutative Hopf algebra, an element &quot;g&quot; is called group-like if Δ&quot;g&quot; = &quot;g&quot; ⊗ &quot;g&quot; and ε&quot;g&quot; = 1, and the group-like elements form a group under multiplication. In the case of the Hopf algebra of a formal group law over a ring, the group like elements are exactly those of the form 
:&quot;D&quot;(0) + &quot;D&quot;(1)&quot;x&quot; + &quot;D&quot;(2)&quot;x&quot;2 + ...
for &quot;nilpotent&quot; elements &quot;x&quot;. In particular we can identify the group-like elements of &quot;H&quot; ⊗ &quot;S&quot; with the nilpotent elements of &quot;S&quot;, and the group structure on the group-like elements of &quot;H&quot; ⊗ &quot;S&quot; is then identified with the group structure on F(&quot;S&quot;).

==Height==
Suppose that &quot;f&quot; is a homomorphism between one-dimensional formal group laws over a field of characteristic &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0. Then &quot;f&quot; is either zero, or the first nonzero term in its power series expansion is formula_13 for some non-negative integer &quot;h&quot;, called the height of the homomorphism &quot;f&quot;. The height of the zero homomorphism is defined to be ∞.

The height of a one-dimensional formal group law over a field of characteristic &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0 is defined to be the height of its &quot;multiplication by p&quot; map.

Two one-dimensional formal group laws over an algebraically closed field of characteristic &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0 are isomorphic if and only if they have the same height, and the height can be any positive integer or ∞.

Examples:
*The additive formal group law &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; has height ∞, as its &quot;p&quot;th power map is 0.
*The multiplicative formal group law &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; + &quot;xy&quot; has height 1, as its &quot;p&quot;th power map is (1 + &quot;x&quot;)&quot;p&quot; − 1 = &quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot;.
*The formal group law of an elliptic curve has height 1 if the curve is ordinary and height 2 if the curve is supersingular. Supersingularity can be detected by the vanishing of the Eisenstein series formula_14.

==Lazard ring==

There is a universal commutative one-dimensional formal group law over a universal commutative ring defined as follows. We let

:&quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;)

be

:&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; + Σ&quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot; &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;y&quot;&quot;j&quot;

for indeterminates

:&quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;,

and we define the universal ring &quot;R&quot; to be the commutative ring generated by the elements &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;, with the relations that are forced by the associativity and commutativity laws for formal group laws. More or less by definition, the ring &quot;R&quot; has the following universal property:
:For any commutative ring &quot;S&quot;, one-dimensional formal group laws over &quot;S&quot; correspond to ring homomorphisms from &quot;R&quot; to &quot;S&quot;.

The commutative ring &quot;R&quot; constructed above is known as Lazard&#x27;s universal ring. At first sight it seems to be incredibly complicated: the relations between its generators are very messy. However Lazard proved that it has a very simple structure: it is just a polynomial ring (over the integers) on generators of degrees 2, 4, 6, ... (where &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot; has degree 2(&quot;i&quot; + &quot;j&quot; − 1)). Daniel Quillen proved that the coefficient ring of complex cobordism is naturally isomorphic as a graded ring to Lazard&#x27;s universal ring, explaining the unusual grading.

==Formal groups==

A formal group is a group object in the category of formal schemes.
* If formula_15 is a functor from Artin algebras to groups which is left exact, then it is representable (&quot;G&quot; is the functor of points of a formal group. (left exactness of a functor is equivalent to commuting with finite projective limits).
* If formula_15 is a group scheme then formula_17, the formal completion of &quot;G&quot; at the identity, has the structure of a formal group.
*The formal completion of a smooth group scheme is isomorphic to formula_18. Some people call a formal group scheme &quot;smooth&quot; if the converse holds; others reserve the term &quot;formal group&quot; for objects locally of this form.
*&quot;Formal smoothness&quot; asserts the existence of lifts of deformations and can apply to formal schemes that are larger than points. A smooth formal group scheme is a special case of a formal group scheme.
*Given a smooth formal group, one can construct a formal group law and a field by choosing a uniformizing set of sections.
*The (non-strict) isomorphisms between formal group laws induced by change of parameters make up the elements of the group of coordinate changes on the formal group.

Formal groups and formal group laws can also be defined over arbitrary schemes, rather than just over commutative rings or fields, and families can be classified by maps from the base to a parametrizing object.

The moduli space of formal group laws is a disjoint union of infinite-dimensional affine spaces, whose components are parametrized by dimension, and whose points are parametrized by admissible coefficients of the power series F. The corresponding moduli stack of smooth formal groups is a quotient of this space by a canonical action of the infinite-dimensional groupoid of coordinate changes.

Over an algebraically closed field, the substack of one-dimensional formal groups is either a point (in characteristic zero) or an infinite chain of stacky points parametrizing heights. In characteristic zero, the closure of each point contains all points of greater height. This difference gives formal groups a rich geometric theory in positive and mixed characteristic, with connections to the Steenrod algebra, &quot;p&quot;-divisible groups, Dieudonné theory, and Galois representations. For example, the Serre-Tate theorem implies that the deformations of a group scheme are strongly controlled by those of its formal group, especially in the case of supersingular abelian varieties. For supersingular elliptic curves, this control is complete, and this is quite different from the characteristic zero situation where the formal group has no deformations.

A formal group is sometimes defined as a cocommutative Hopf algebra (usually with some extra conditions added, such as being pointed or connected). This is more or less dual to the notion above. In the smooth case, choosing coordinates is equivalent to taking a distinguished basis of the formal group ring.

Some authors use the term &quot;formal group&quot; to mean &quot;formal group law&quot;.

==Lubin–Tate formal group laws==

We let Z&quot;p&quot; be the ring of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers. The Lubin–Tate formal group law is the unique (1-dimensional) formal group law &quot;F&quot; such that &quot;e&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;px&quot; + &quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot; is an endomorphism of &quot;F&quot;, in other words
:formula_19
More generally we can allow &quot;e&quot; to be any power series such that &quot;e&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;px&quot; + higher-degree terms and &quot;e&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot; mod &quot;p&quot;. All the group laws for different choices of &quot;e&quot; satisfying these conditions are strictly isomorphic.

For each element &quot;a&quot; in Z&quot;p&quot; there is a unique endomorphism &quot;f&quot; of the Lubin–Tate formal group law such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;ax&quot; + higher-degree terms. This gives an action of the ring Z&quot;p&quot; on the Lubin–Tate formal group law.

There is a similar construction with Z&quot;p&quot; replaced by any complete discrete valuation ring with finite residue class field.

This construction was introduced by , in a successful effort to isolate the local field part of the classical theory of complex multiplication of elliptic functions. It is also a major ingredient in some approaches to local class field theory and an essential component in the construction of Morava E-theory in chromatic homotopy theory.

<text>Baron Ventry, of Ventry in the County of Kerry, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland.

== History ==
It was created in 1800 for Sir Thomas Mullins, 1st Baronet. He had already been created a Baronet, of Burnham in the County of Kerry, in the Baronetage of Ireland in 1797. The Mullins family claimed descent from the Norman De Moleyns family. The first Baron&#x27;s grandson, the third Baron (who succeeded his uncle), resumed the alleged &#x27;ancient&#x27; family name of De Moleyns by Royal licence in 1841. His son, the fourth Baron, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1871 to 1914. Lord Ventry also assumed the additional surname of Eveleigh, which was that of an earlier ancestor. His younger son, the sixth Baron, married Evelyn Muriel Stuart Daubeny. the titles are held by their grandson, the eighth Baron, who succeeded his uncle in 1987. In 1966 he assumed by deed poll the surname of Daubeney de Moleyns.

The family seat now is Hill of Errol House near Errol, Perthshire. The family&#x27;s former seat was Burnham House, near Dingle in County Kerry. The family sold Burnham House in the 1920s. It is now a girls&#x27; school.

<text>Intel&#x27;s i960 (or 80960) was a RISC-based microprocessor design that became popular during the early 1990s as an embedded microcontroller. It became a best-selling CPU in that segment, along with the competing AMD 29000. In spite of its success, Intel stopped marketing the i960 in the late 1990s, as a result of a settlement with DEC whereby Intel received the rights to produce the StrongARM CPU. The processor continues to be used for a few military applications.

==Origin==

The i960 design was begun in response to the failure of Intel&#x27;s iAPX 432 design of the early 1980s. The iAPX 432 was intended to directly support high-level languages that supported tagged, protected, garbage-collected memory—such as Ada and Lisp—in hardware. Because of its instruction-set complexity, its multi-chip implementation, and design flaws, the iAPX 432 was very slow in comparison to other processors of its time.

In 1984, Intel and Siemens started a joint project, ultimately called BiiN, to create a high-end, fault-tolerant, object-oriented computer system programmed entirely in Ada. Many of the original i432 team members joined this project, although a new lead architect, Glenford Myers, was brought in from IBM. The intended market for the BiiN systems was high-reliability-computer users such as banks, industrial systems, and nuclear power plants.

Intel&#x27;s major contribution to the BiiN system was a new processor design, influenced by the protected-memory concepts from the i432. The new design was to include a number of features to improve performance and avoid problems that had led to the i432&#x27;s downfall. The first 960 processors entered the final stages of design, known as &quot;taping-out&quot;, in October 1985 and were sent to manufacturing that month, with the first working chips arriving in late 1985 and early 1986.

The BiiN effort eventually failed, due to market forces, and the 960 was left without a use. Myers attempted to save the design by extracting several subsets of the full capability architecture created for the BiiN system. He tried to convince Intel management to market the i960 (then still known as the &quot;P7&quot;) as a general-purpose processor, both in place of the Intel 80286 and i386 (which taped-out the same month as the first i960), as well as the emerging RISC market for Unix systems, including a pitch to Steve Jobs for use in the NeXT system. Myers was unsuccessful at convincing Intel management to support the i960 as a general-purpose or Unix processor, but the chip found a ready market in early high-performance 32-bit embedded systems.

The lead architect of i960 was superscalarity specialist Fred Pollack who was also the lead engineer of the Intel iAPX 432 and the lead architect of the i686 chip, the Pentium Pro.

==Architecture==
The i960 family features four distinct architectures, designed for upward binary compatibility:

* Core architecture is a RISC-like core
* Numerics architecture adds floating point
* Protected architecture adds paged memory management, supervisor/user protection, string instructions, process scheduling, interprocess communication for the OS, and symmetric multiprocessing
* Extended architecture adds object protection and interprocess communication for applications

In the initial release, the 80960KA supported the Core architecture, the 80960KB supported the Numerics architecture, the 80960MC supported the Protected architecture, and the 80960XA supported the Extended architecture.

To avoid the performance issues that plagued the i432, the central i960 instruction-set architecture was a RISC design. In the Extended architecture, the memory subsystem was 33-bits wide—to accommodate a 32-bit word and a &quot;tag&quot; bit to implement memory protection in hardware. In many ways, the i960 followed the original Berkeley RISC design, notably in its use of register windows, an implementation-specific number of caches for the per-subroutine registers that allowed for fast subroutine calls. The competing Stanford University design, MIPS, did not use this system, instead relying on the compiler to generate optimal subroutine call and return code. In common with most 32-bit designs, the i960 has a flat 32-bit memory space, with no memory segmentation, except for the Extended architecture, which could support up to 226 &quot;objects&quot;, each up to 232 bytes in size. The i960 architecture also anticipated a superscalar implementation, with instructions being simultaneously dispatched to more than one unit within the processor.

==i960 variants==

===80960MC===
The i960MC included all of the features of the original BiiN system; but these were simply not mentioned in the specifications, leading some to wonder why the i960MC was so large and had so many pins - 53 out of 132 - labeled &quot;no connect&quot;. Later iterations of the i960, like the 80960Jx series, have a more typical number of &quot;do no connect&quot; and use more power and ground pins and have additional I/O pins instead. However, these &quot;no connect&quot; pins are actually not connected internally and unrelated to the BiiN feature set - the silicon die inside does not have bond pads for them.

The 80960MC contains an on-chip memory management unit and supports fault tolerant systems in conjunction with Intel&#x27;s M82965 Bus Extension Unit as well. Both chips meets MIL-STD-883C standard. Both chips became available in the first quarter of 1989 with the price of US$2400 and US$1700 respectively. Extended temperature samples became available in August 1988 as well.

It contains 32 32-bit registers, a 512 byte instruction cache, a stack frame cache, a high speed 32-bit multiplexed burst bus, and an interrupt controller. It also has 256 interrupt vectors and 32 levels of interrupt priority.

===80960XA===
The 80960XA is a military member of the i960 family, implementing the Extended architecture, a superset of the military 80960MC. It supports object-oriented programming with a 33rd tag bit in hardware, a Capability. It supports the Joint Industrial Avionics Working Group (JIAWG) 32-bit ISA standard.

===80960KA, 80960KB===
A version of the RISC core without memory management or an FPU became the i960KA, and the RISC core with an FPU became the i960KB. The versions were, however, identical internally—only the labeling was different. This meant the CPUs were much larger than necessary for the &quot;actually supported&quot; feature sets, and as a result, more expensive to manufacture than they needed to be.

These processors contain more than 350,000 transistors. These processors can perform around 7.5 VAX MIPS. The 80960KB version is compatible with IEEE 754 standard and can perform up to 4 MWIPS. Both processors are available in 16 and 20 MHz using CHMOS-III technology. Both processors are packaged in 132-PGA. The 80960KA version is available for US$230 and the 80960KB version is available for US$390 in quantities of 100 respectively.

The i960KA became successful as a low-cost 32-bit processor for the laser-printer market, as well as for early graphics terminals and other embedded applications. Its success paid for future generations, which were without the complex memory sub-system.

===80960CA, 80960CF===
The was announced in July 1989. It featured a newly designed superscalar RISC core and added an unusual addressable on-chip cache, but lacked an FPU and MMU, as it was intended for high-performance embedded applications. The i960CA is widely considered to have been the first single-chip superscalar RISC implementation. The C-series included only one ALU, but could dispatch and execute an arithmetic instruction, a memory reference, and a branch instruction at the same time, and sustain two instructions per cycle under certain circumstances. The first versions released ran at 33 MHz, and Intel promoted the chip as capable of 66 MIPS. The i960CA microarchitecture was designed in 1987–1988 and formally announced on September 12, 1989.

Later, in May 1992, came the i960CF, which included a larger instruction cache (4 KB instead of 1 KB) and added 1 KB of data cache, but was still without an FPU or MMU.

===80960MX===
The 80960MX is a superscalar implementation of the Extended architecture, executing up to three instructions per clock execution for sustained performance of 25 VAX MIPS. It implemented the Joint Industrial Avionics Working Group (JIAWG) 32-bit ISA standard. It was originally packaged in a 348 lead ceramic pin grid array and later supplied as a bare die. The i960 MX supports object-oriented programming. A 33rd tag bit distinguished between a 32-bit data word and a 32-bit pointer to memory. This prohibited forged pointers to protected areas of memory.

===80960Jx===
The 80960Jx is a processor for embedded applications. It features a 32-bit multiplexed address/data bus, instruction and data cache, 1K on-chip RAM, interrupt controller, and two independent 32-bit timers. The 80960Jx&#x27;s testability features included ONCE (on-circuit emulation) mode and boundary scan (JTAG).

===80960HA, 80960HD, 80960HT===
The 80960Hx processors offered upgraded performance from the Cx variants by offering clock multiplication, larger 16K instruction cache and 4k data cache, and a GMU (Guarded Memory Unit). The HD variant had an internal 2× clock multiplication while the HT version has a 3x clock multiplication, allowing increased performance without external bus speed changes.

===80960VH===
Announced in October 1998, the i960VH Embedded-PCI processor featured a 32-bit 33 MHz PCI bus and 100 MHz i960JT processor core. The core also featured 16 KB of instruction cache, 4 KB of data cache, and 1 KB of built-in RAM. Other core features included two 32-bit timers, programmable interrupt controller, I²C interface, and a two-channel DMA controller.

===80960Rx===
The 80960Rx processors were labeled as I/O Processors and included an implementation of the PCI Bus (2.1 or 2.2 depending on the variant) as well as a 80960Jx core. These could be used on motherboards to implement on-board PCI device as well as on PCI expansion cards. The RM/RN/RS variants used a JT core with a 3x bus to core multiplication to achieve 100 MHz internal clock speeds, while the RD variant used a JF core with 2× multiplication to achieve 66 MHz. The RP variant had a JF core that ran at the 33 MHz bus speed.

==Variant specifications==



==End of development==
Intel attempted to bolster the i960 in the I/O device controller market with the I2O standard, but this had little success and the design work was eventually ended. By the mid-1990s its price/performance ratio had fallen behind competing chips of more recent design, and Intel never produced a reduced-power-consumption version that could be used in battery-powered systems.

In 1990, the i960 team was redirected to be the &quot;second team&quot; working in parallel on future i386 implementations—specifically the P6 processor, which later became the Pentium Pro. The i960 project was given to another smaller development team, essentially ensuring the end of its developmental life.

==Current status==

Some i960 I/O processors, such as the 80303, include a built-in hardware XOR engine for RAID algorithms. They are used as controllers for higher-end, RAID-capable, SCSI-disk-array, host-adapter cards as well as Digital Equipment/Compaq/HP&#x27;s high-end SCSI and DSSI, and eventually Fibre Channel HSx-series, standalone RAID controllers.

An i960RS chip also powers Adaptec&#x27;s AAR-2400A controller, which uses four commodity parallel ATA drives to build an affordable RAID-5 protected fault-tolerant storage system for small PC servers and workstations.

The i960 was also used in some Brocade Fibre Channel switches to run Fabric OS.

The i960 architecture is also used in slot machines. Currently, they are found in IGT&#x27;s Stepper S2000 family and i960 video family. It was also used as the main CPU of Sega&#x27;s famous Model 2 series of arcade boards.

The Indian Air Force&#x27;s HAL Tejas light combat aircraft&#x27;s MMR (multi-mode radar) is said to use the i960. The HAL Tejas was introduced into service in 2015.

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is said to use the chip in its on-board computers in its launch vehicles.

The i960 processor is also used in Automatic Radar Plotting Aid (ARPA) interfacing boards in radars from Kelvin Hughes.

The chip was used on some HP X-Terminals.

Some SATA RAID controllers use Intel&#x27;s 80303 IOP (Intelligent I/O Processor), which integrates a PCI-to-PCI bridge, memory controller, and a 80960JT-100 CPU core.

The chip was used on the Alcatel-Lucent 1000 ADSL broadband modem.

<doc id="480356" wikidata="Q507402" url="?curid=480356" title="Cryogenian">
<text>The Cryogenian (from , meaning &quot;cold&quot; and , , meaning &quot;birth&quot;) is a geologic period that lasted from . It is the second of the three periods of the Neoproterozoic era, preceded by the Tonian and followed by the Ediacaran.

The Cryogenian was a time of drastic climate changes. After the long environmental stability/stagnation during the Boring Billion, the Sturtian glaciation began at the beginning of Cryogenian, freezing the entire planet in a state of severe icehouse climate known as a snowball Earth. After 70 million years it ended, but was quickly followed by another global ice age, the Marinoan glaciation. There is controversy over whether these glaciations indeed covered the entire planet, or whether a band of open sea survived near the equator (i.e. &quot;slushball Earth&quot;), but the extreme climates with massive expanse of ice sheets blocking off sunlight would nevertheless have significantly hindered primary production in the shallow seas and caused major mass extinctions and biosphere turnovers.

==Ratification==
The Cryogenian Period was ratified in 1990 by the International Commission on Stratigraphy. In contrast to most other time periods, the beginning of the Cryogenian is not linked to a globally observable and documented event. Instead, the base of the period is defined by a fixed rock age, that was originally set at 850 million years, but changed in 2015 to 720 million years.

This could cause ambiguity because estimates of rock age are subject to variable interpretation and laboratory error. For instance, the time scale of the Cambrian Period is not reckoned by rock younger than a given age ( million years), but by the appearance of the worldwide &quot;Treptichnus pedum&quot; diagnostic trace fossil assemblages, which can be recognized in the field without extensive lab testing.

Currently, there is no consensus on what global event is a suitable candidate to mark the start of the Cryogenian Period, but a global glaciation would be a likely candidate.

==Climate==

The name of the geologic period refers to the very cold global climate of the Cryogenian.

Characteristic glacial deposits indicate that Earth suffered the most severe ice ages in its history during this period (Sturtian and Marinoan). According to Eyles and Young, &quot;Late Proterozoic glaciogenic deposits are known from all the continents. They provide evidence of the most widespread and long-ranging glaciation on Earth.&quot; Several glacial periods are evident, interspersed with periods of relatively warm climate, with glaciers reaching sea level in low paleolatitudes.

Glaciers extended and contracted in a series of rhythmic pulses, possibly reaching as far as the equator.
The Cryogenian is generally considered to be divisible into at least two major worldwide glaciations. The Sturtian glaciation persisted from 720 to 660 million years ago, and the Marinoan glaciation which ended approximately 635 Ma, at the end of the Cryogenian. The deposits of glacial tillite also occur in places that were at low latitudes during the Cryogenian, a phenomenon which led to the hypothesis of deeply frozen planetary oceans called &quot;Snowball Earth&quot;. Between the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations was a so-called &quot;Cryogenian interglacial period&quot; marked by relatively warm climate and anoxic oceans, along with marine transgression.

== Paleogeography ==

Before the start of the Cryogenian, around 750 Ma, the cratons that made up the supercontinent Rodinia started to rift apart. The superocean Mirovia began to close while the superocean Panthalassa began to form. The cratons (possibly) later assembled into another supercontinent called Pannotia, in the Ediacaran.

Eyles and Young state, &quot;Most Neoproterozoic glacial deposits accumulated as glacially influenced marine strata along rifted continental margins or interiors.&quot; Worldwide deposition of dolomite might have reduced atmospheric carbon dioxide. The break up along the margins of Laurentia at about 750 Ma occurs at about the same time as the deposition of the Rapitan Group in North America, contemporaneously with the Sturtian in Australia. A similar period of rifting at about 650 Ma occurred with the deposition of the Ice Brook Formation in North America, contemporaneously with the Marinoan in Australia. The Sturtian and Marinoan are local divisions within the Adelaide Rift Complex.

== Cryogenian biota and fossils ==
Between the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations, global biodiversity was very low.

Fossils of testate amoeba (or Arcellinida) first appear during the Cryogenian Period. Since 2009, some researchers have argued that during the Cryogenian Period, potentially the oldest known fossils of sponges, and therefore animals, were formed. However, it is unclear whether these fossils actually belong to sponges, though the authors do not rule out the possibility of such fossils to represent proto-sponges or complex microbial precursors to sponge-grade organisms. The issue of whether or not biology was impacted by this event has not been settled, for example Porter (2000) suggests that new groups of life evolved during this period, including the red algae and green algae, stramenopiles, ciliates, dinoflagellates, and testate amoeba.

The end of the period also saw the origin of heterotrophic plankton, which would feed on unicellular algae and prokaryotes, ending the bacterial dominance of the oceans. The unicellular algae (Archaeplastida) went through a big bang of diversification, and their population went up by a factor of a hundred to a thousand.

<text>46P/Wirtanen is a small short-period comet with a current orbital period of 5.4 years. It was the original target for close investigation by the &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft, planned by the European Space Agency, but an inability to meet the launch window caused &quot;Rosetta&quot; to be sent to 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko instead. It belongs to the Jupiter family of comets, all of which have aphelia between 5 and 6 AU. Its diameter is estimated at . In December 2019, astronomers reported capturing an outburst of the comet in substantial detail by the TESS space telescope.

== Discovery ==
46P/Wirtanen was discovered photographically on January 17, 1948, by the American astronomer Carl A. Wirtanen. The plate was exposed on January 15 during a stellar proper motion survey for the Lick Observatory. Due to a limited number of initial observations, it took more than a year to recognize this object as a short-period comet.

== Perihelion passages ==
The July 2013 perihelion passage was not favorable, only reaching a magnitude of 14.7.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comet 46P/Wirtanen Information&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 23 and September 26 of 2013, the comet had an elongation less than 20 degrees from the Sun.

On 16 December 2018 the comet passed from Earth, marking one of the 10 closest comet flybys of Earth in 70 years. The comet reached an estimated magnitude of 3.9, making this pass the brightest one predicted, and the brightest close approach for the next 20 years. The comet experienced six outbursts, with the comet brightening by −0.2 to −1.6 magnitudes.

The 2018 close approach, combined with Wirtanen&#x27;s brightness provides an opportunity to study a potential future spacecraft mission target in detail. A worldwide observing campaign was organized to capitalize on the favorable circumstances of the 2018 apparition.

== Exploration proposals==


The comet was the target for the proposed Comet Hopper mission, which reached the finalist stage in the NASA Discovery program. It was one of only three missions in that selection to have a more detailed study. The selection process was ultimately won in 2012 by the InSight mission, a Mars lander. The Comet Hopper was designed to use the ASRG, the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator.

The Comet Hopper mission, if it were selected, would have had multiple science goals over the 7.3 years of its nominal lifetime. At roughly 4.5 AU the spacecraft would rendezvous with Comet Wirtanen and begin to map the spatial heterogeneity of surface solids as well as gas and dust emissions from the coma - the nebulous envelope around the nucleus of a comet. The remote mapping would also allow for any nucleus structure, geologic processes, and coma mechanisms to be determined. After arriving at the comet, the spacecraft would approach and land, then subsequently hop to other locations on the comet. As the comet approached the Sun, the spacecraft would land and hop multiple times. The final landing would occur at 1.5 AU. As the comet approached the Sun and became more active, the spacecraft would be able to record surface changes.

Also, 46P/Wirtanen was the original destination of the European Space Agency&#x27;s Rosetta spacecraft mission, but launch delays meant that the comet was no longer easily reachable and another periodic comet, 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, was chosen as the mission&#x27;s target instead.

== Associated meteor showers ==

=== 2023 ===
Close approaches to Jupiter in 1972 and 1984 moved the comet&#x27;s orbit closer to Earth, and as of epoch 2018 the comet has an Earth–MOID of . In 2023 Earth passed through a denser part of the 1974 meteoroid stream than Earth did in 2007. As a result a shower with radiant in the southern constellation of Sculptor was observed with a zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) of and was given the name &quot;λ&quot;-Sculptorids. The meteors made atmospheric entry (Ve) at a relatively slow 15 km/s and as a result the mean mass of the meteoroids observed was about 0.5 grams, about 10 times higher than that of other meteor showers.

=== 2012 ===
Russian forecaster Mikhail Maslov had predicted that the Earth&#x27;s orbit would cross Comet Wirtanen&#x27;s debris stream as many as four times between December 10 and December 14, 2012. As there had not previously been an encounter with this debris stream, it was not certain whether or not a meteor shower would be visible from Earth, but there was speculation that a shower with as many as 30 meteors per hour might occur.

Observers in Australia reported that on the night of December 14, 2012, as many as a dozen meteors were seen emanating from the predicted radiant in the constellation of Pisces.

<doc id="480378" wikidata="Q1401466" url="?curid=480378" title="Pure Data">
<text>Pure Data (Pd) is a visual programming language developed by Miller Puckette in the 1990s for creating interactive computer music and multimedia works. While Puckette is the main author of the program, Pd is an open-source project with a large developer base working on new extensions. It is released under BSD-3-Clause. It runs on Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android and Windows. Ports exist for FreeBSD and IRIX.

Pd is very similar in scope and design to Puckette&#x27;s original Max program, developed while he was at IRCAM, and is to some degree interoperable with Max/MSP, the commercial predecessor to the Max language. They may be collectively discussed as members of the Patcher family of languages.

With the addition of the Graphics Environment for Multimedia (GEM) external, and externals designed to work with it (like Pure Data Packet / PiDiP for Linux, ), framestein for Windows, GridFlow (as n-dimensional matrix processing, for Linux, , Windows), it is possible to create and manipulate video, OpenGL graphics, images, etc., in realtime with extensive possibilities for interactivity with audio, external sensors, etc.

Pd is natively designed to enable live collaboration across networks or the Internet, allowing musicians connected via LAN or even in disparate parts of the globe to create music together in real time. Pd uses FUDI as a networking protocol.

== Similarities to Max ==
Pure Data and Max are both examples of dataflow programming languages. Dataflow languages model a program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations. In Pure Data and Max, functions or &quot;objects&quot; are linked or &quot;patched&quot; together in a graphical environment which models the flow of the control and audio. Unlike the original version of Max, however, Pd was always designed to do control-rate and audio processing on the host central processing unit (CPU), rather than offloading the sound synthesis and signal processing to a digital signal processor (DSP) board (such as the Ariel ISPW which was used for Max/FTS). Pd code forms the basis of David Zicarelli&#x27;s MSP extensions to the Max language to do software audio processing.

Like Max, Pd has a modular code base of &quot;externals&quot; or objects which are used as building blocks for programs written in the software. This makes the program arbitrarily extensible through a public API, and encourages developers to add their own control and audio routines in the C programming language, or with the help of other externals, in Python, Scheme, Lua, Tcl, and many others. However, Pd is also a programming language. Modular, reusable units of code written natively in Pd, called &quot;patches&quot; or &quot;abstractions&quot;, are used as standalone programs and freely shared among the Pd user community, and no other programming skill is required to use Pd effectively.

== Language features ==
Like Max, Pd is a dataflow programming language. As with most DSP software, there are two primary rates at which data is passed: sample (audio) rate, usually at 44,100 samples per second, and control rate, at 1 block per 64 samples. Control messages and audio signals generally flow from the top of the screen to the bottom between &quot;objects&quot; connected via inlets and outlets.
Pd supports four basic types of text entities: messages, objects, atoms, and comments. Atoms are the most basic unit of data in Pd, and they consist of either a float, a symbol, or a pointer to a data structure (in Pd, all numbers are stored as 32-bit floats). Messages are composed of one or more atoms and provide instructions to objects. A special type of message with null content called a &quot;bang&quot; is used to initiate events and push data into flow, much like pushing a button.

Pd&#x27;s native objects range from the basic mathematical, logical, and bitwise operators found in every programming language to general and specialized audio-rate DSP functions (designated by a tilde (~) symbol), such as wavetable oscillators, the Fast Fourier transform (fft~), and a range of standard filters. Data can be loaded from file, read in from an audio board, MIDI, via Open Sound Control (OSC) through a FireWire, USB, or network connection, or generated on the fly, and stored in tables, which can then be read back and used as audio signals or control data.

=== Data structures ===
One of the key innovations in Pd over its predecessors has been the introduction of graphical data structures. These can be used in a large variety of ways, from composing musical scores, sequencing events, to creating visuals to accompany Pd patches or even extending Pd&#x27;s GUI.

Living up to Pd&#x27;s name, data structures enable Pd users to create arbitrarily complex static as well as dynamic or animated graphical representations of musical data. Much like C structs, Pd&#x27;s structs are composed of any combination of floats, symbols, and array data that can be used as parameters to describe the visual appearance of the data structure or, conversely, to control messages and audio signals in a Pd patch. In Puckette&#x27;s words:

== Language limitations ==
Though a powerful language, Pd has certain limitations in its implementation of object-oriented concepts. For example, it is very difficult to create massively parallel processes because instantiating and manipulating large lists of objects (spawning, etc.) is impossible due to a lack of a constructor function. Further, Pd arrays and other entities are susceptible to namespace collisions because passing the patch instance ID is an extra step and is sometimes difficult to accomplish.

== Projects using Pure Data ==
Pure Data has been used as the basis of a number of projects, as a prototyping language and a sound engine. The table interface called the Reactable and the abandoned iPhone app RjDj both embed Pd as a sound engine.

Pd has been used for prototyping audio for video games by a number of audio designers. For example, EAPd is the internal version of Pd that is used at Electronic Arts (EA). It has also been embedded into EA Spore.

Pd has also been used for networked performance, in the Networked Resources for Collaborative Improvisation (NRCI) Library.

== Code examples ==

# The first patch prints &quot;hello world&quot; to the display.
# The second patch applies reverberation to the incoming signal from channel 1, then emits it on channels 1 and 2.
# The last, more complex patch filters white noise at 9000 Hz (with a Q of 20), then fades it in and out each second over the course of a half second. In Pd, time is measured in milliseconds, thus the &#x27;1000&#x27; is one second and the &#x27;500&#x27; is a half second.

<text>In computer engineering, register windows are a feature which dedicates registers to a subroutine by dynamically aliasing a subset of internal registers to fixed, programmer-visible registers. Register windows are implemented to improve the performance of a processor by reducing the number of stack operations required for function calls and returns. One of the most influential features of the Berkeley RISC design, they were later implemented in instruction set architectures such as AMD Am29000, Intel i960, Sun Microsystems SPARC, and Intel Itanium.
==General operation==
Several sets of registers are provided for the different parts of the program. Registers are deliberately hidden from the programmer to force several subroutines to share processor resources. 

Rendering the registers invisible can be implemented efficiently; the CPU recognizes the movement from one part of the program to another during a procedure call. It is accomplished by one of a small number of instructions (&quot;prologue&quot;) and ends with one of a similarly small set (&quot;epilogue&quot;). In the Berkeley design, these calls would cause a new set of registers to be &quot;swapped in&quot; at that point, or marked as &quot;dead&quot; (or &quot;reusable&quot;) when the call ends.

==Application in CPUs==
In the Berkeley RISC design, only eight registers out of a total of 64 are visible to the programs. The complete set of registers are known as the register file, and any particular set of eight as a window. The file allows up to eight procedure calls to have their own register sets. As long as the program does not call down chains longer than eight calls deep, the registers never have to be &quot;spilled&quot;, i.e. saved out to main memory or cache which is a slow process compared to register access.

By comparison, the Sun Microsystems SPARC architecture provides simultaneous visibility into four sets of eight registers each. Three sets of eight registers each are &quot;windowed&quot;. Eight registers (i0 through i7) form the input registers to the current procedure level. Eight registers (L0 through L7) are local to the current procedure level, and eight registers (o0 through o7) are the outputs from the current procedure level to the next level called. When a procedure is called, the register window shifts by sixteen registers, hiding the old input registers and old local registers and making the old output registers the new input registers.
The common registers (old output registers and new input registers) are used for parameter passing. Finally, eight registers (g0 through g7) are globally visible to all procedure levels.

The AMD 29000 improved the design by allowing the windows to be of variable size, which helps utilization in the common case where fewer than eight registers are needed for a call. It also separated the registers into a global set of 64, and an additional 128 for the windows. Similarly, the IA-64 (Itanium) architecture used variable-sized windows, with 32 global registers and 96 for the windows.

In the Infineon C166 architecture, most registers are simply locations in internal RAM which have the additional property of being accessible as registers. Of these, the addresses of the 16 general-purpose registers (R0-R15) are not fixed. Instead, the R0 register is located at the address pointed to by the &quot;Context Pointer&quot; (CP) register, and the remaining 15 registers follow sequentially thereafter.

Register windows also provide an easy upgrade path. Since the additional registers are invisible to the programs, additional windows can be added at any time. For instance, the use of object-oriented programming often results in a greater number of &quot;smaller&quot; calls, which can be accommodated by increasing the windows from eight to sixteen for instance. This was the approach used in the SPARC, which has included more register windows with newer generations of the architecture. The end result is fewer slow register window &quot;spill&quot; and &quot;fill&quot; operations because the register windows overflow less often.

==Criticism==
A drawback of register windows is that context switches require saving a large number of registers to memory. The SPARC implementation always advances the register window by sixteen registers, meaning that when this happens, many of these saved registers will not even contain useful data. Some have criticized the original studies that led to the implementation of register windows, for considering only programs in isolation and ignoring multitasking workloads. 

Register windows are not the only way to improve register performance. The group at Stanford University designing the MIPS saw the Berkeley work and decided that the problem was not a shortage of registers, but poor utilization of the existing ones. They instead invested more time in their compiler&#x27;s register allocation, making sure it wisely used the larger set available in MIPS. This resulted in reduced complexity of the chip, with one half the total number of registers, while offering potentially higher performance in those cases where a single procedure could make use of the larger visible register space. In the end, with modern compilers, MIPS makes better use of its register space even during procedure calls.

<text>Napoleonic medals are medals including those struck by the Paris Medal Mint celebrating the accomplishments of Napoleon I of France. The exact number of these medals
is not precisely known since the official records of Napoleon&#x27;s reign, including
the list of medals struck by the mint, were erased by King Louis XVIII. Counting
medals struck in England and Italy, the total number of different medals exceeds 2,000.

The sizes of these medals vary, although most are approximately 40mm in diameter.
Many were struck in copper, although silver and gold were also used. The copper medals
have a patina applied, which protects the copper from eroding and makes the medal look
like bronze. A single copy of most of the medals was struck in gold for Napoleon&#x27;s personal collection. Many of these gold medals were sold at auction from the personal collection of Victor Bonaparte.

The most definitive catalog of Napoleonic medals was created by a collector named
Bramsen in three volumes published between 1904 and 1913. This catalog identifies more than 2300 medals, including medals struck by the Paris Mint and as well as medals from other countries related to Napoleon or his reign. The most common type, known as the St. Helena Medal, was issued to French grognards who rallied to Napoleon&#x27;s cause during the Hundred Days.

There are at least 26 known volumes of &quot;The Napoleon Medals&quot; by Edward Edwards. Most copies are in Museums but some are held in private hands. It is a complete series of the medals struck in France, Italy, Great Britain and Germany, from the commencement of the French Republic in 1804 to the restoration in 1815. The books were printed in (M.DCCC.XXXV11) (1837) by Henry Hering, London.

Many of the medals struck during Napoleon&#x27;s reign were restruck later from the same dies. Determining when a given medal was struck is sometimes difficult. Restrikes can often
be identified by a punch mark applied to the edge of the medal, which is usually denoted by the word &#x27;BRONZE&#x27;.

<doc id="480385" wikidata="Q7577809" url="?curid=480385" title="Spirella">
<text>The name Spirella refers to the Spirella Stay which was invented by Marcus Merritt Beeman in the US in 1904 and made from tightly twisted and flattened coils of wire. The founders were Beeman, William Wallace Kincaid and Jesse Homan Pardee.

== Origins ==
The Spirella name was used by the Spirella Corset Company Inc that was founded in 1904 in Meadville, Pennsylvania, USA. It was founded on a patent of dressbone, for bustles, but started corset manufacture in 1904. The company manufactured made-to-measure corsets. Benefits for the company&#x27;s employees included travel, education and health care.

=== United Kingdom ===

The UK subsidiary was The Spirella Company of Great Britain. Spirella co-founder and entrepreneur William Wallace Kincaid commissioned the architect Cecil Hignett to design a state-of-the art factory of architectural beauty. The design included embellishments in Arts &amp; Crafts styling. This factory, the Spirella Building, was built and expanded in stages between 1912 and 1920.
During World War II, the Irvin Airchute Company expanded its production of parachutes into the Spirella Building and women working for the British Tabulating Machine Company secretly produced components for the decoding machines called Bombes. In September 1957, the company ceased to be under the control of the US firm.

The company&#x27;s most popular corset was the Model 305. Spirella products were not sold in shops. Instead, female staff called corsetiers (or corsetières) were sent to customers&#x27; homes.
After an ill-fated attempt to market garments of &quot;Stub-tex&quot;, a form of Gore-Tex being used under licence from W. L. Gore &amp; Associates, the company was sold in 1985 to the rival Spencers of Banbury and finally closed in July 1989.

The Spirella Building was designed to provide workers with a highly productive and pleasant environment that focused on the comfort of factory employees. Referred to as the &quot;factory of beauty&quot;, it offered a wide array of employee amenities including &quot;baths, showers, gymnastics classes, a library, free eye tests and bicycle repairs&quot;. In 1979 it was Grade II* listed. The Letchworth Garden City Foundation bought the neglected building in 1995, restored the interior and re-opened it for leased office accommodation. It currently houses over twenty businesses.

== Locations ==
At its height the company had factories in the USA (Meadville, Pennsylvania, New Haven, Connecticut, and Lincoln Nebraska ), in Canada (in 1910), in the UK (in 1910; from 1912 in the Spirella Building in Letchworth) and in Sweden (Malmö) in 1920 and Niagara Falls NY (in 1917). Their flagship location was &quot;Spirella House&quot; on Oxford Circus, London. A factory built in 1910 in Niagara falls, Ontario, eventually became the premises of the Bird Kingdom Tropical Adventure.

==Archival Collections==
A number of organisations have collected archival examples of documents and objects related to the Spirella Factory. The Garden City Collection in Letchworth includes over forty objects and documents in its collection. Additionally, collections are maintained by Hertfordshire&#x27;s Community Archives Network. Archival examples include: the Castle Corset cartoon and an advertisement for the Spirella War Savings Association.

<doc id="480387" wikidata="Q506006" url="?curid=480387" title="Joe Henderson">
<text>Joe Henderson (April 24, 1937 – June 30, 2001) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist and very occasional flute player. In a career spanning more than four decades, Henderson played with many of the leading American players of his day and recorded for several prominent labels, including Blue Note, Milestone, and Verve.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Lima, Ohio, Henderson was one of 14 children. He was encouraged by his parents, Dennis and Irene (née Farley) and older brother James T. to study music. He dedicated his first album to them &quot;for being so understanding and tolerant&quot; during his formative years. Early musical interests included drums, piano, saxophone and composition. According to trumpeter Kenny Dorham, two local piano teachers who went to school with Henderson&#x27;s brothers and sisters, Richard Patterson and Don Hurless, gave him a knowledge of the piano. He was particularly enamored of his brother&#x27;s record collection.

A hometown drummer, John Jarette, advised Henderson to listen to musicians like Lester Young, Stan Getz, Dexter Gordon and Charlie Parker. He also liked Flip Phillips, Lee Konitz and the Jazz at the Philharmonic recordings. However, Parker became his greatest inspiration. Henderson&#x27;s first approach to the saxophone was under the tutelage of Herbert Murphy in high school. During this time, he wrote several scores for the school band.

By age 18, Henderson was active on the Detroit jazz scene of the mid-&#x27;50s, playing in jam sessions with visiting New York City stars. While attending classes for flute and bass at Wayne State University, he further developed his saxophone and compositional skills under the guidance of renowned teacher Larry Teal at the Teal School of Music. In late 1959, he formed his first group. By the time he arrived at Wayne State University, he had transcribed and memorized so many Lester Young solos that his professors believed he had perfect pitch. Henderson&#x27;s college classmates included Yusef Lateef, Barry Harris and Donald Byrd. He also studied music at Kentucky State College.

Shortly prior to his army induction in 1960, Henderson was commissioned by UNAC to write some arrangements for the suite &quot;Swings and Strings&quot;, which was later performed by a ten-member orchestra and the local dance band of Jimmy Wilkins.

===Early career===
Henderson spent two years (1960–62) in the U.S. Army: first in Fort Benning, where he competed in an Army talent show and won first place, then in Fort Belvoir, where he was chosen for a world tour, with a show to entertain soldiers. While in Paris, he met Kenny Drew and Kenny Clarke. Then he was sent to Maryland to conclude his enlistment. In 1962, he was finally discharged and promptly moved to New York. He first met trumpeter Kenny Dorham, who provided invaluable guidance, at saxophonist Junior Cook&#x27;s place. That evening, they went to hear Dexter Gordon at Birdland. Henderson was asked by Gordon to play something with his rhythm section and happily accepted.

Although Henderson&#x27;s earliest recordings were marked by a strong hard-bop influence, his playing encompassed not only the bebop tradition, but R&amp;B, Latin and avant-garde as well. He soon joined Horace Silver&#x27;s band, and provided a seminal solo on the jukebox hit &quot;Song for My Father&quot;. After leaving Silver&#x27;s band in 1966, Henderson resumed freelancing and also co-led a big band with Dorham. His arrangements for the band went unrecorded until the release of &quot;Joe Henderson Big Band&quot; (Verve) in 1996.

===Blue Note recordings===
From 1963 to 1968, Henderson appeared on nearly 30 albums for Blue Note, including five released under his name. The recordings ranged from relatively conservative hard-bop sessions (&quot;Page One&quot;, 1963) to more explorative sessions (&quot;Inner Urge&quot; and &quot;Mode for Joe&quot;, 1966). He played a prominent role in many landmark albums under other leaders for the label, including most of Horace Silver&#x27;s &quot;Song for My Father&quot;, Grant Green&#x27;s &quot;Idle Moments&quot;, Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, Lee Morgan&#x27;s &quot;The Sidewinder&quot;, and &quot;out&quot; albums with pianist Andrew Hill (&quot;Black Fire&quot;, 1963 and &quot;Point of Departure&quot;, 1964) and drummer Pete La Roca (&quot;Basra&quot;, 1965).

In 1967, there was a brief association with Miles Davis&#x27;s quintet featuring Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter and Tony Williams, although the band was never recorded. Henderson&#x27;s adaptability and eclecticism would become even more apparent in the years to follow.

===Milestone Records recordings===
Signing with Orrin Keepnews&#x27;s fledgling Milestone label in 1967 marked a new phase in Henderson&#x27;s career. He co-led the Jazz Communicators with Freddie Hubbard from 1967 to 1968. Henderson was also featured on Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; for Warner Bros. It was during this time that Henderson began to experiment with jazz-funk fusion, studio overdubbing, and other electronic effects. Song and album titles such as &quot;Power to the People&quot;, &quot;In Pursuit of Blackness&quot;, and &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; reflected his growing political awareness and social consciousness, although Black Narcissus was named after the 1947 Powell and Pressburger film of the same title.

After a brief association with Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears in 1971, Henderson moved to San Francisco. He was still signed to Milestone Records, which had recently moved to San Francisco after being acquired by Fantasy Records. Henderson wanted to be near his label, and get out of New York City. Henderson lived in San Francisco for the rest of his life, and taught at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music from 1978 to 1982, according to musicologist Joel Geoffrey Harris. A performance space at the San Francisco Jazz Center is named for him.

===Later career and death===
Though he occasionally worked with Echoes of an Era, the Griffith Park Band and Chick Corea, Henderson remained primarily a leader throughout the 1980s. An accomplished and prolific composer, he began to focus more on reinterpreting standards and his own earlier compositions. Blue Note attempted to position the artist at the forefront of a resurgent jazz scene in 1986 with the release of the two-volume &quot;State of the Tenor&quot; recorded at the Village Vanguard in New York City. The albums (with Ron Carter on bass and Al Foster on drums) revisited the tenor trio form used by Sonny Rollins in 1957 on his own live Vanguard albums for the same label. Henderson established his basic repertoire for the next seven or eight years, with Thelonious Monk&#x27;s &quot;Ask Me Now&quot; becoming a signature ballad feature. Following his brief return to Blue Note Records, Henderson was signed by the Italian label Red Records, for which he recorded two more albums in the piano-less trio format.

In 1991, Verve records signed Henderson to the label. That January, Henderson made a guest appearance on Stephen Scott&#x27;s Verve album &quot;Something to Consider&quot;, and worked with Verve producer and vice president Richard Seidel during the session. Henderson and Seidel had first worked together in 1979 while making Henderson&#x27;s &quot;Relaxin&#x27; at Camarillo&quot; album. After Verve expressed interest in signing Henderson, the saxophonist had to quickly complete his existing contract with Red Records, which he did by recording &quot;The Standard Joe&quot; in March 1991. Seidel said in a 2016 interview with musicologist Joel Geoffrey Harris that he decided to offer Henderson a record deal after hearing him perform live at Fat Tuesdays in New York. Seidel served as producer on all five of Henderson&#x27;s 1990s Verve studio albums. Verve adopted a &#x27;songbook&#x27; approach to recording him, coupling it with a considerable marketing and publicity campaign, which more successfully positioned Henderson at the forefront of the contemporary jazz scene. His 1992 &#x27;comeback&#x27; album &quot;Lush Life: The Music of Billy Strayhorn&quot; was a commercial and critical success, and was followed by tribute albums to Miles Davis, Antonio Carlos Jobim, a big band album, and a jazz adaptation of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. After that time, he no longer recorded. 

A chain smoker, Henderson died in San Francisco, California on June 30, 2001, after a long battle with emphysema. He was 64.

<doc id="480388" wikidata="Q1282338" url="?curid=480388" title="Robert Coover">
<text>Robert Lowell Coover (February 4, 1932 – October 5, 2024) was an American novelist, short story writer, and T. B. Stowell Professor Emeritus in Literary Arts at Brown University. He is generally considered a writer of fabulation and metafiction. He became a proponent of electronic literature and was a founder of the Electronic Literature Organization.

==Background==
Coover was born in Charles City, Iowa. He attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale, received his B.A. in Slavic Studies from Indiana University Bloomington in 1953, then served in the United States Navy from 1953 to 1957, where he became a lieutenant. He received an M.A. in General Studies in the Humanities from the University of Chicago in 1965. In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. Coover served as a teacher or writer in residence at many universities. He taught at Brown University from 1981 to 2012.

==Literary career==
Coover&#x27;s first novel was &quot;The Origin of the Brunists&quot;, in which the sole survivor of a mine disaster starts a religious cult. His second book, &quot;The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop.&quot;, deals with the role of the creator. The eponymous Waugh, a shy, lonely accountant, creates a baseball game in which rolls of the dice determine every play, and dreams up players to attach those results to.

Coover&#x27;s 1969 short story collection &quot;Pricksongs and Descants&quot; contains the celebrated metafictional story &quot;The Babysitter,&quot; which was adapted into the 1995 movie of the same title, directed by Guy Ferland.

Coover&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;The Public Burning&quot;, deals with the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in terms that have been called magic realism. Half of the book is devoted to the mythic hero Uncle Sam of tall tales, dealing with the equally fantastic Phantom, who represents international Communism. The alternate chapters portray the efforts of Richard Nixon to stage the execution of the Rosenbergs as a public event in Times Square. As reviewer Thomas R. Edwards wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Astonishingly, Nixon is the most interesting and sympathetic character in the story.&quot;

Coover&#x27;s 1982 novella &quot;Spanking the Maid&quot; remained one of his favorites; asked in an interview &quot;Which of your books will get you into heaven?&quot;, Coover quipped, &quot;&quot;Spanking the Maid&quot;. God&#x27;s deep into S&amp;M.&quot; A later novella, &quot;Whatever Happened to Gloomy Gus of the Chicago Bears&quot; (1987), offers an alternate Nixon, one who is devoted to football and sex with the same doggedness with which he pursued political success in this reality. The theme anthology &quot;A Night at the Movies&quot; includes the story &quot;You Must Remember This&quot;, a piece about &quot;Casablanca&quot; that features an explicit description of what Rick and Ilsa did when the camera wasn&#x27;t on them. &quot;Pinocchio in Venice&quot; returns to mythical themes.

In 1987 he was the winner of the Rea Award for the Short Story. In 2021, Coover, in a collaboration with Art Spiegelman, released &quot;Street Cop&quot;.

== Electronic literature ==

Coover was a supporter of early electronic literature, and was one of the founders of the Electronic Literature Organization. He taught electronic literature at Brown University and organized events such as the Technology Platforms for 21st Century Literature (TP21CL), held at Brown in 1999. In 1992 he published the essay &quot;The End of Books&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, making a mainstream audience aware of the new genre for perhaps the first time. The &quot;now infamous&quot; essay &quot;roiled the literary scene and declaimed the imminent demise of the novel&quot;. Many scholars of electronic literature reference the essay, for instance J. Yellowlees Douglas in the title of her book, &quot;The End of Books–Or Books Without End? Reading Interactive Narratives&quot;. In 1993, Coover published a second &quot;New York Times&quot; essay on electronic literature titled &quot;Hyperfiction: Novels for the Computer&quot;. 

Coover established the Master of Fine Arts program in Digital Language Arts at Brown University, and helped bring a string of writers of electronic literature to the university, including John Cayley, Talan Memmott, Noah Wardrip-Fruin, William Gillespie, and Samantha Gorman. Talan Memmott was Brown University&#x27;s first graduate fellow of electronic writing.

==Personal life and death==
Coover&#x27;s wife was the noted needlepoint artist Pilar Sans Coover.
They have three children, including Sara Caldwell.

Coover died at a care home in Warwick, England, on October 5, 2024, at the age of 92.

<text>Memory Foundations is the name given by Daniel Libeskind to his site plan for the World Trade Center, which was originally selected by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) to be the master plan for rebuilding at the World Trade Center site in New York City in February 2003.

Memory Foundations placed a large memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks at the center of the World Trade Center. Surrounding the memorial was to be five large office buildings arranged in an ascending spiral upward from the southeast of the site. The spiral would culminate in the complex&#x27;s tallest building, the One World Trade Center, a spire. Also included would be the World Trade Center Transportation Hub; the National September 11 Museum; a Performing Arts Center designed by Frank Gehry; and various parks and public spaces.

The actual design (the one which is constructed) involves a different design and arrangement of buildings. The original plan aimed to fully replace the of office space lost on September 11, 2001, to memorialize the victims of the attacks, and to revive New York City&#x27;s economy and skyline.

<doc id="480404" wikidata="Q218371" url="?curid=480404" title="Empetrum">
<text>Empetrum is a genus of three species of dwarf evergreen shrubs in the heath family, Ericaceae. They are commonly known as crowberries and bear edible fruit. Species of &quot;Empetrum&quot; include: &quot;E. nigrum&quot; (crowberry) and its tetraploid subspecies &quot;E. nigrum&quot; ssp. &quot;hermaphroditum&quot;, &quot;E. eamesii&quot; and &quot;E. rubrum&quot;.

== Description ==
All three species are evergreen mat forming shrubs, with small, light green needle-like leaves long. The flowers are small and either bisexual or dioecious. The fruit is a fairly dry berry. The plant has slender, wiry, spreading branches covered with short, narrow, stiff leaves, the margins of which are recurved so as to form a hollow cylinder concealing the hairy under face of the leaf, which protects against excessive loss of water from the leaf.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus and related ones such as &quot;Ceratiola&quot; and &quot;Corema&quot; were for most of the 20th century classified in their own family Empetraceae, but molecular data, leaf morphology, and other considerations point to their inclusion in the Ericaceae (specifically, as a tribe within the subfamily Ericoideae). This tribe does share a number of distinctive morphological features, which seem to be associated with wind pollination.

Species of &quot;Empetrum&quot; include: &quot;E. nigrum&quot; (crowberry or black crowberry) and its tetraploid subspecies &quot;E. nigrum&quot; ssp. &quot;hermaphroditum&quot;, &quot;E. eamesii&quot; and &quot;E. rubrum&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
They are commonly found in the Northern Hemisphere, from temperate to subarctic climates, and also in the Southern Andes of South America and on the South Atlantic islands of South Georgia, the Falklands and Tristan da Cunha. The typical habitat is on moorlands, tundra, muskeg and spruce forests. They are also often found in areas of coastal exposure on the sand dunes and dune slacks.

==Uses==
The vitamin content of crowberries is low, as is also the concentration of volatile liquids, the lack of which makes them almost odorless. The acidity is lower than is typically encountered in forest berries.

In subarctic areas, &quot;Empetrum&quot; has been a vital addition to the diet of the Inuit and the Sami. After waning popularity, the crowberry is regaining its reputation as an edible berry. It provides a steady crop and the gathering is relatively easy. The high concentration of anthocyanin pigment can be used as a natural food dye. The Dena&#x27;ina (Tanaina) harvest it for food, sometimes storing in quantity for winter, and like it mixed with lard or oil. They keep well in a cool place without any special preparation.

The berries are usually collected in the fall of the year but if not picked they may persist on the plant and can be picked in the spring. The Inuit and Native Americans mix them with other berries, especially the blueberry. Cooking enhances the flavor. They make good pie and jelly.

The leaves and stems are used in Dena&#x27;ina medicine for diarrhea and stomach problems; they are boiled or soaked in hot water, and the strained liquid drunk.

In Dena&#x27;ina plantlore in the Outer and Upper Inlet area of Lake Clark, the root is also used as a medicine, being used to remove a growth on an eye and to heal sore eyes. The roots are boiled and the eyes are washed with the strained, cooled tea, to which a little sugar may be added.

Crowberries are also occasionally grown as ornamental plants in rockeries, notably the yellow-foliage cultivar &quot;Empetrum nigrum&quot; &#x27;Lucia&#x27;.

<doc id="480407" wikidata="Q1467248" url="?curid=480407" title="USS Parche (SSN-683)">
<text>USS &quot;Parche&quot; (SSN-683), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the parche , a small, coral reef butterfly fish. &quot;Parche&quot; was launched on 13 January 1973, sponsored by Natalie Beshany, the wife of Vice Admiral Philip A. Beshany, and commissioned on 17 August 1974.

Attributed as being a key resource of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, &quot;Parche&quot; is said to be &quot;the most highly decorated vessel in U.S. history.&quot;

==Operational history==

===1974–1979===

&quot;Parche&quot; served as a unit of the United States Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force from 1974 until 1976, before transferring to the United States Pacific Fleet in October 1976. Once arriving at her new home port at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California, &quot;Parche&quot; received ocean engineering modifications. &quot;Parche&quot; deployed on a shakedown training cruise in August and September 1978.

===Operation Ivy Bells, 1979===
In the book &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff&quot;, it is claimed that &quot;Parche&quot; successfully tapped into Soviet underwater military communication cables in the Sea of Okhotsk as part of Operation Ivy Bells.

===1979–2004===

During her career, &quot;Parche&quot; was ostensibly involved in recovering Soviet missile fragments from the seabed following test launches. While missile fragments were indeed collected in large numbers, &quot;Parche&quot;&#x27;s primary missions typically revolved around the setting and retrieving of wire taps placed on Soviet underwater communication cables. Much of her operational history was spent undertaking clandestine missions, and as of late 2009, a vast majority of the missions undertaken remain classified.

From 1987 to 1991, &quot;Parche&quot; underwent an extended refueling overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard during which she was modified for research and development work. An extension measuring was added to her hull just forward of her sail. The added section was flat-topped (looking somewhat like the missile deck of a ballistic missile submarine) and provided the space required to support a larger crew and additional equipment. These additions included an extensive array of signals-intelligence-collecting antennas, electronic gear, and other navigational and ocean engineering equipment. The overhaul also added many auxiliary navigational and maneuvering features, including both upward and forward-facing short-range sonars, and a suite of armored spotlights and closed-circuit television cameras for under-ice operations.

Upon completion of her modifications in 1991, &quot;Parche&quot; began a new mission as part of Submarine Development Squadron 5. She resumed operations in the Pacific Fleet in 1992.

&quot;Parche&quot; was transferred to a new home port, Naval Base Kitsap at Bangor, Washington, in November 1994.

&quot;Parche&quot; may have recovered Chinese missile fragments. During the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1995 and 1996, the People&#x27;s Republic of China launched DF-21 and DF-15 ballistic missiles into the sea surrounding Taiwan to deter Taiwan from moving toward independence; Robert Karniol writes: &quot;I suspect that &quot;the &quot;Parche&quot; might have gone after these Chinese missile fragments&quot;, and &quot;I suspect that Beijing gave away some useful missile secrets.&quot;

==Decommissioning and disposal==
On 19 October 2004, a decommissioning ceremony took place at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington; she was officially decommissioned on 18 July 2005 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. The wardroom of the oldest submarine in the fleet carries Richard O&#x27;Kane&#x27;s personal cribbage board, and upon &quot;Parche&quot;″s decommissioning the board was transferred to the next oldest boat: . Her scrapping at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard via the Ship and Submarine Recycling Program was completed on 30 November 2006.

&quot;Parche&quot;″s research and development duties were assumed by , a whose construction period was extended to include modifications that will allow her to carry out the same types of research and development. According to Robert Karniol, &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; in succeeding &quot;Parche,&quot; has become &quot;Washington″s premier spy submarine.&quot;

==Military awards ==
As of 2007, &quot;Parche&quot; was said to be &quot;the most highly decorated vessel in U.S. history&quot;, receiving a total of nine Presidential Unit Citations and ten Navy Unit Commendations. The submarine also received thirteen Navy Expeditionary Medals and thirteen awards of the Battle Efficiency Award during her thirty years of service.
==Commemoration==

&quot;Parche&quot;″s sail was preserved. It was moved from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to the maritime park near Puget Sound Navy Museum in downtown Bremerton. The sail is decorated with stripes for the unit awards and ribbons:

<text>The ephors were a board of five magistrates in ancient Sparta. They had an extensive range of judicial, religious, legislative, and military powers, and could shape Sparta&#x27;s home and foreign affairs.

The word &quot;ephors&quot; (Ancient Greek &quot;éphoroi&quot;, plural form of &quot;éphoros&quot;) comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;epi&quot;, &quot;on&quot; or &quot;over&quot;, and &quot;horaō&quot;, &quot;to see&quot;, i.e., &quot;one who oversees&quot; or &quot;overseer&quot;. The ephors were a council of five Spartan men elected annually who swore an oath monthly on the behalf of the state. The Spartan kings, however, would swear on behalf of themselves.

The ephors did not have to kneel before the Kings of Sparta, and were held in high esteem by the citizens because of the importance of their powers and because of the holy role that they earned throughout their functions.

Several other Greek city-states with a Spartan ancestry also had ephors, such as Taras or Cyrene.

== History ==

=== Creation ===
Two different accounts of the origins of the ephorate exist in ancient sources. The earliest account is found in the &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus, who traces its origins to the mythical Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus—a version followed by Xenophon, Plato, or Isocrates. A diverging version first appears in the &quot;Politics&quot;, written in the middle of the 4th century BCE by Aristotle, who tells that the ephorate was created by the Spartan king Theopompos. This version is then more prevalent in subsequent authors, such as Cicero, and especially Plutarch. Modern scholars have identified the source of the second version in a lost work written by the Agiad king Pausanias after he had been forced to abdicate and go into exile in 394 BCE. In this &quot;logos&quot;, Pausanias likely published Lycurgus&#x27; laws, including the Rhetra, which details the different element of the Spartan constitution (kings, gerousia, ekklesia), but does not mention the ephors. It has therefore been suggested that Pausanias was hostile to the ephors, to whom he possibly attributed his banishment, and published the Rhetra to discredit their office. Although the contents of this &quot;logos&quot; and Pausanias&#x27; motivations remain disputed, most modern scholars think the ephors were created at the time of Theopompos, during the Messenian Wars.

According to Plutarch, the ephorate was born out of the necessity for leaders while the kings of Sparta were absent for long periods during the Messenian Wars. The ephors were elected by the popular assembly, and all citizens were eligible. The position of ephor was the only political office open to the whole &quot;damos&quot; (populace) of men between the ages of 30–60, so eligible Spartans highly sought after the position. They were forbidden to be re-elected and provided a balance for the two kings, who rarely co-operated. Plato called the ephors tyrants, who ran Sparta as despots while the kings were little more than generals. Up to two ephors would accompany a king on extended military campaigns as a sign of control, and they held the authority to declare war during some periods in Spartan history.

Since political and economic decisions were made by majority vote, Sparta&#x27;s policy could change quickly, when the vote of one ephor changed. For example, in 403 BCE, Pausanias convinced three of the ephors to send an army to Attica, a complete reversal of the policy of Lysander. According to Aristotle, the ephors frequently came from poverty because any Spartan citizen could hold the position, and it was not exclusive to the upper-class. Aristotle stated that because of this they were often liable to corruption. There were times when the legal power of an ephor was taken advantage of, such as with Alcibiades&#x27;s use of Endius, who persuaded the Spartans to allow Alcibiades to take control of Sparta&#x27;s peace mission to Athens in 420 BCE.

Cleomenes III abolished the position of ephor in 227 BCE, and replaced them with a position called the &quot;patronomos&quot;. Cleomenes&#x27;s coup resulted in the death of four of the five ephors, along with ten other citizens. His abolition of the ephorship allowed him to cement his role as king and prevent anyone from stopping his political reforms. However, the ephorate was restored by the Macedonian King Antigonus III Doson after the Battle of Sellasia in 222 BCE. Although Sparta fell under Roman rule in 146 BCE, the position existed into the 2nd century CE, when it was likely abolished by Roman Emperor Hadrian and superseded by imperial governance as part of the province of Achaea.

== Election ==
The ephorate elections took place close to the Autumn equinox, because the term of the ephors matched the Spartan year, which started with the first full Moon after the equinox, therefore the end of September or October.

There was probably an age requirement of at least 30 years old to be elected ephor, the age from which a Spartan citizen was no longer considered eromenos.

The Spartan constitution is principally known through the work of Aristotle, who describes in detail the elections of the gerontes (the members of the Gerousia), but not the ephors. It is still assumed that the election procedure was similar. Candidates passed one by one before the assembled citizens, who shouted according to their preference, while several assessors who were confined into a windowless building declared winners the five candidates with the loudest shouts. As with the gerontes, this system of voice voting was considered &quot;childish&quot; by Aristotle, because influential men could easily manipulate the results by pressuring the jury.

The kings played a prominent role during election campaigns by favouring their candidates, even though only one instance of such practice is known, when in 243/2 Lysander was elected ephor with the help of the king Agis IV. The fact that influential kings such as Cleomenes I or Agesilaus II had no reported conflict with the ephors support the view that they could decide who would be the ephors. Some ephors were elected thanks to a famous deed that made them known among voters. For example, Leon, ephor in 419/8, had won the quadriga race at the Olympic Games in 440, while his son Antalkidas had concluded a treaty with Persia in 387 before becoming ephor in 370/69. The famous general Brasidas was elected in 431 just after his victory against Athens at Methone.

== Eponymous ephor ==
One of the ephors was eponymous, i.e. he gave his name to the year, like the eponymous archon in Athens. He was probably designated during the elections as the candidate with the loudest shouts overall. The eponymous ephor did not have any additional power compared to his colleagues; it was only a prestigious position. In 413/2, the ordinary ephor Endios is thus described by Thucydides as wielding a lot of influence within the college, even though the eponymous was Onomantios.

As the eponymous ephors were used as dates, a list compiling their names existed in Sparta, and is mentioned by Polybius. This list was perhaps published by Apollodoros and Sosicrates, whose lost works were used by Diogenes Laertius. The list went at least as far as 556 (the year of Chilon&#x27;s ephorate) and possibly up to 754 (during the reign of Theopompos as ancient authors believed). However, Diogenes lived in the 3rd century AD, and even his sources dated from the Hellenistic era, long after the events.

==Legal power==

The ephors held numerous duties in legislative, judicial, financial, and executive matters. Following Lycurgus&#x27;s &quot;Asteropus&quot; in 620 BCE (increase in the power of the ephorate), the ephors became the ambassadors of Sparta. They handled all matters associated with foreign relations, including the creation of treaties with foreign powers and meeting with emissaries to discuss foreign politics. They held power within Sparta by also acting as the Presidents of the assembly and the justices of the supreme civil court as well as controlling army composition. The ephors needed a majority vote to make decisions binding and minority or dissenting decisions were not accepted by the assembly.

According to Plutarch, every autumn at the crypteia, the ephors would &quot;pro forma&quot; declare war on the helot population so that any Spartan citizen could kill a helot without fear of blood guilt. This was done to keep the large helot population in check. Plutarch also stated that every eight years the ephors would watch the skies on a moonless night. If shooting stars occurred, it was up to the ephors to decide whether one or both of the kings had transgressed in his dealings with the gods. A transgression could include any behavior that dishonored the Greek pantheon. Unless the oracle from Delphi or Olympia stated otherwise, the ephors had the ability to depose the offending king or kings. Plutarch also stated that the ephors tried cases involving contracts among citizens. He further reported that each ephor specialized in a different type of disputed contract.

According to Pausanias, the ephors served with the Gerousia on the Supreme criminal court of Sparta. This included presiding over treason, homicide, and other offenses that carried serious punishments. These punishments included exile, death, and disfranchisement.

Ephors had the authority to summon and preside over the assembly&#x27;s regular meetings in the fifth century BCE. Initially this power was only assigned to kings in early years. However, with the passing of the Great Rhetra regular meetings became mandated. By the late sixth century BCE, the ephors had acquired this authority to oversee the assembly and could use this power against the kings of Sparta. For example, they used this authority to force King Anaxandridas II to change his conjugal arrangements to their advantage. King Anaxandridas&#x27; wife was barren but he refused to divorce her so the ephors forced him to marry a second wife to provide heirs.

Two ephors were always sent on military expeditions to ensure the king acted in line, and if not, could put the king on trial. Many kings were put on trial by the ephors, including Leotychidas, who was found to have accepted a bribe from the Thessalians during his military expedition to Thessaly.
The ephors, along with the Gerousia, held the majority of the power within the Spartan government, as the two kings had to consult either with the ephors or the Gerousia in almost any official matter. The ephors also held power over the Helots and the Perioeci. They controlled the Crypteia, the secret police who repressed the Helots, and they were even able to sentence Perioeci to death without a trial.

== Other duties ==
The congress of the Peloponnesian League was always chaired by an ephor.

The ephors also had the authority to choose three &quot;hippagretai&quot; (Commanders of the Guard) every year from men over the age of thirty. The chosen &quot;hippagretes&quot; would then choose three hundred of the best &quot;hebontes&quot; to form a &quot;hippeis&quot;. The ephors also were responsible for penalizing disobedience in the military using fines.

Ephors could also intervene in cases of &quot;disturbing the peace.&quot; This included punishing underage Spartans indirectly for their offenses against Sparta. This form of retribution would include penalizing the boys&#x27; &quot;erastes&quot; (adult lovers). When men between the ages of twenty and thirty (known as &quot;hebontes&quot;) committed offenses they were brought before the &quot;paidonomos&quot;, a magistrate charged with supervising the education of the youth in the &quot;agoge&quot;. Through this system the ephors could directly penalize the &quot;hebontes&quot; by giving them large fines.

The ephors paid close attention to the education of young Spartans, and played a significant role in ensuring the education was up to standard. According to Aelian, they would examine the naked bodies of the boys every ten days to ensure they were of proper complexion and fitness and not being overfed, as well as examining the boys&#x27; clothes daily to ensure that they fit.

The ephors had their own syssitia, the common meal of Spartan citizens.

== Notable ephors ==

Only 67 ephors are known by name before the end of the third century BCE, out of potentially 3000.
* Endius: Scion of wealthy family, son of Alcibiades (served in 413/2 BCE).

* Brasidas: Came from higher class family (served in 431/0 BC).
* Leon: Became an ephor at an older age and was the founder of a Spartan colony and Olympic victor (served in 419/8 BCE).
* Antalcidas: Known for being the negotiator of peace treaty, named after him (served in 387/6 BCE).
* Sthenelaidas: Known for causing physical division in the voting process by making voters stand in separate spaces to represent yes or no votes. This eliminated the secrecy of the voting process. (served in 432 BCE).
* Cleandridas: Known for abandoning the invasion of Athens and returning to Peloponnese in 446 BCE. He went voluntarily into exile, with the Spartans condemning him to death in absentia.
* Lysander: Was sent as an ambassador to King Agesilaus II on multiple campaigns but suffered a dispute with King Agesilaus over the locals&#x27; loyalty to him. Lysander returned home upon the end of term as ephor (served in 243 BCE).
* Nausikleidas: Accompanied and supported King Pausanias on expedition (served in 403 BCE).
* Epitadeus: Introduced legislation that destroyed the equal distribution of land that Lukourgos made in the fourth century BCE.
* Chilon: Served in 556/5 BCE.
* Agesilaos: Named eponymous ephor by his nephew Agis IV and was charged with implementing a new bill which included debt-cancellation and land-redistribution.

== Other Greek &quot;poleis&quot; with ephors ==
* Euesperides (Benghazi, Libya): The city was a colony of Cyrene and adopted its institutions as a result. It therefore counted ephors and a gerousia.
* Herakleia (Lucania, Italy): The eponymous magistrate of the city was an ephor, because it reproduced the institutions of its mother-city, Taras.
* Cyrene (Libya): Cyrene had a gerousia and a board of five ephors from an early date. It was a foundation of Thera.
* Messene (Peloponnese): Messene took its independence from Sparta in 370/69, but retained some of its institutions, such as the ephors, who are mentioned c. 295.
* Taras (Taranto, Italy): The ephorate is attested in the 3rd century, but considering that its colony Herakleia also had ephors, Taras probably had ephors since the Archaic Era. The office was eponymous in the 3rd century.
* Thera (Santorini Island): A board of three ephors were eponymous magistrates in the city.

==Ephors in modern culture==
The concept of an ephorate continues to be used by some contemporary organizations which require a monarchical element within a democratic framework. One such organization is the Ephorate of the Rascals, Rogues, and Rapscallions, an American fraternal research society.

The Hellenic Republic Ministry of Culture and Sports contains several regional ephorates that carry out the administration of archaeological investigations in their respective regions

The Neapolitan Republic&#x27;s constitution of 1799, written by Francesco Mario Pagano, envisaged what would now be described as a constitutional court, the &quot;eforato&quot;, but the republic lasted only six months.

Zack Snyder&#x27;s 2007 film adaptation of the Battle of Thermoplyae, &quot;300&quot;, depicts ephors as priestly class that exercise power by interpreting the words of the Oracle. In the film they are dramatized as elderly lepers with pale skin and lesions. At the beginning of the movie, Leonidas is shown visiting the ephors and proposing a war strategy to them. The ephors then consult the Oracle and refuse Leonidas&#x27; plan, showing that they have been bribed by Xerxes I. King Leonidas thus leads his 300 &#x27;bodyguards&#x27; to Thermoplyae without their approval.

Rudolph Maté&#x27;s 1962 film &quot;The 300 Spartans&quot; also depicts the ephorate&#x27;s role in the Battle of Thermopylae. They are shown conflicting with King Leotychidas over the decision to delay the battle until after the religious harvest festival of Carneia. The ephors decide to delay the battle but under the guise of having private bodyguards, King Leonidas marches into battle with 300 Spartans. The ephors are mentioned later in the film when Leonidas receives a letter from his wife informing him that the ephors have the remainder of the Spartan army will not be joining him. Xenathon is a named ephor in the film.

Ephors have appeared in Steven Pressfield&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Gates of Fire,&quot; an historical fiction novel that recounts the Battle of Thermopylae. In Chapter 15, the ephors appear when a delegation of mothers and wives goes to the council, requesting they be allowed to join the battle.

In Kieron Gillen&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Three&quot;, ephors are referenced when Gillen describes the Krypteia and writes &quot;Once a year, the masters declare war on the helots.&quot; The ephors were in charge of the Krypteia and declaring war on the helots in order to keep them terrified and controlled. The next scene depicts the ephor, Eurytos, being guided by his soldiers to a helot community where they demand hospitality. Eurytos is killed by a helot revolt and the only surviving soldier returns to Sparta to inform the remaining four ephors. The ephors send soldiers to kill the helots who killed Eurytos stating, &quot;The only thing more unthinkable than a helot killing an ephor is that helot escaping punishment.&quot;

<text>BiiN Corporation was a company created out of a joint research project by Intel and Siemens to develop fault tolerant high-performance multi-processor computers build on custom microprocessor designs. BiiN was an outgrowth of the Intel iAPX 432 multiprocessor project, ancestor of iPSC and nCUBE. 

The company was closed down in October 1989, and folded in April 1990, with no significant sales. The whole project was considered within Intel to have been so poorly managed that the company name was considered to be an acronym for &quot;Billions Invested In Nothing&quot;. However, several subset versions of the processor designed for the project were later offered commercially as versions of the Intel i960, which became popular as an embedded processor in the mid-1990s.

== History ==

BiiN began in 1982 as Gemini, a research project equally funded by Intel and Siemens. The project&#x27;s aim was to design and build a complete system for so-called &quot;mission critical&quot; computing, such as on-line transaction processing, industrial control applications (such as managing nuclear reactors), military applications intolerant of computer downtime, and national television services. The central themes of the R&amp;D effort were to be transparent multiprocessing and file distribution, dynamically switchable fault tolerance, and a high level of security. Siemens provided the funding through its energy division UBE (&quot;Unternehmensbereich Energietechnik&quot;), who had an interest in fault tolerant computers for use in nuclear installations, while Intel provided the technology, and the whole project was organised with alternate layers of Siemens and Intel management and engineers. Siemens staff stemmed from its various divisions, not just &quot;UBE&quot; (where the project unit was called &quot;E85G&quot;).
The core development labs were located on an Intel site in Portland, OR, but there were also Siemens labs in Berlin, Germany, (&quot;Sietec Systemtechnik&quot;, Maxim Ehrlich&#x27;s team creating the Gemini DBMS), Vienna, Austria, Princeton, New Jersey (United States) and also Nuremberg, Germany, involved in the development.

Since neither Siemens nor Intel could see how to market this new architecture if it were broken up, in 1985 the project became BiiN Partners, and in July 1988 was launched as a company wholly owned by Intel and Siemens. A second company wholly owned by Intel, called BiiN Federal Systems, was also created in order to avoid Foreign Ownership and Controlling Interest (FOCI) problems in selling to the US government. Intel owned all the silicon designs which were licensed to Siemens, while Siemens owned all the software and documentation and licensed them to Intel. 

BiiN aimed their designs at the high-end fault tolerant market, competing with Tandem Computers and Stratus Computer, as opposed to the parallel processing market, where Sequent Computer Systems, Pyramid Technology, Alliant Computer Systems and others were operating. In order to compete here they had to make sure their first designs were as powerful as the best from the other vendors, and by the time such a system was ready both Intel and Siemens had spent about $300 million with no shipping units.

In 1989 Siemens underwent a reorganization, which brought &quot;UBE&quot;&#x27;s own computer division into the mix. They had long been working with Sequent Computer Systems, and were sceptical that the BiiN systems would deliver anything that the Sequent systems could not. Eventually Intel and Siemens could not agree on further funding, and the venture ended. Several pre-orders on the books were cancelled, and the technology essentially disappeared.

With the closing of the project, Intel used the basic RISC core of the CPU design as the basis for the i960 CPU. For this role most of the &quot;advanced&quot; features were removed, including the complex tagged memory system, task control system, most of the microcode and even the FPU. The result was a &quot;naked&quot; core, useful for embedded processor use. Before Intel switched to the StrongARM for the embedded role in the late 1990s, the i960 was one of Intel&#x27;s most popular products.

One odd historical footnote is that Hughes Aircraft had licensed the silicon designs for use in the Advanced Tactical Fighter (now the F-22 Raptor), where it apparently continues to be used today.

== Description ==
Key to the BiiN system was the 960 XA processor, essentially a RISC-based version of the earlier i432. Like the i432 , the 960 XA included tagged memory for complete memory protection even within programs (as opposed to most CPU&#x27;s, which offer protection only between programs), a full set of instructions for task control, and complex microcode to run it all.

Unlike the i432, the 960 XA had fairly good performance, mostly as a side effect of dramatically reducing the complexity of the core instruction set, integration of all CPU functions on a single chip, and including an FPU. The CPUs were hosted on cards that included an I/O support CPU and either 8 to 16MB of RAM. 

Two systems were designed, the BiiN 20 was an entry-level machine with one or two processors, and an interesting battery-backed disk-cache. The larger BiiN 60 was similar, but supported up to eight CPUs. Both machines could be used in larger multi-machine systems.

One interesting feature of the BiiN was that the CPU sets could be used to provide either fault tolerance, as in the Tandem systems, or parallel processing, as in the Pyramid and Sequent systems. This allowed users to tailor their systems to their needs, even on the fly. The BiiN systems also provided two versions of fault tolerance. In &quot;fault-checking mode&quot;, processors were paired so that they could check one another&#x27;s calculations. In event of an error, the processors would stop, and the circuitry would determine which was faulty. This processor would then be excluded from the system, and the computer would restart. In &quot;continuous operation mode&quot; the fault-checking pairs were duplicated, so that if an error occurred the second pair could immediately take over the calculations.

Also of historical note was that the operating system (OSIRIS), applications, development tools, and every other piece of BiiN software was written exclusively in Ada — perhaps the largest non-military use of that programming language.

There was a command line interpreter &quot;CLI&quot;, that resembled a lot command shells&#x27; functionality only a couple of years later, like editable history and so forth.
Documentation for Gemini was done in troff with a project proprietary set of macros or with the Scribe markup language.

Development for Gemini happened on VAXes running BSD Unix.

<doc id="480417" wikidata="Q2631387" url="?curid=480417" title="Education in the Republic of Ireland">
<text>Education in the Republic of Ireland is a primary, secondary and higher (often known as &quot;third-level&quot; or tertiary) education. In recent years, further education has grown immensely, with 51% of working age adults having completed higher education by 2020. Growth in the economy since the 1960s has driven much of the change in the education system. For universities there are student service fees (up to €3,000 in 2015), which students are required to pay on registration, to cover examinations, insurance and registration costs.

The Department of Education, under the control of the Minister for Education and Youth, is in overall control of policy, funding and direction, while other important organisations such as the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education Authority, and on a local level the Education and Training Boards, are the only comprehensive system of government organisation. The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, a department formed in August 2020, creates policy and controls funding for third-level institutions. Many other statutory and non-statutory bodies have a function in the education system. , the Minister for Education and Youth is Helen McEntee and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is James Lawless.

==History==
On 10 September 1966, the Fianna Fáil Education Minister, Donogh O&#x27;Malley, made an unauthorised speech announcing plans for free upper second-level education in Ireland. Free upper second-level education was eventually introduced in September 1967, and is now widely seen as a milestone in Irish history.

In 1973, the Irish language requirement for a second-level certificate was abandoned.

==Structure==
Students must go to schools from ages 6 to 16 or until they have completed three years of second-level of education.
 Under the Constitution of Ireland, parents are not obliged &quot;in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State.&quot; However, the parental right to homeschool his/her child has met legal contests over minimum standards in the absence of constitutional provision for State-defined educational standards.

While English is the primary medium of instruction at all levels in most schools across the state, in Gaelscoileanna (Irish-language schools), Irish is the primary medium of instruction at all levels and English is taught as a second language. The Irish language remains a core subject taught in all public schools, with exemptions given to individual pupils on grounds of significant periods lived abroad, learning difficulties and other similar and/or valid reasons.

At third level, most university courses are conducted in English, with only a few Irish language options. Some universities offer courses partly through French, German or Spanish.

===Framework===
===Years===

Education is compulsory for all children in Ireland from the ages of six to sixteen or until students have completed three years of second-level education and including one sitting of the Junior Certificate examination. Primary education commonly starts at four to five years old. Children typically enrol in a Junior Infants class at age four or five, depending on parental wishes. Some schools enrollment policies have age four as the minimum age requirement.

====Pre-school====

Most play schools in Ireland are in the private sector. Increasingly, children of working parents, who are below school age, attend a myriad of crèches, play-schools, Montessori schools, etc., which have sprung up in response to the changing needs of modern families. These operate as businesses and may charge often substantial childcare fees. Since 2009, in response to public demand for affordable childcare, children may receive two years of free enrollment in preschool in the years prior to starting primary schools under the Early Childcare and Education Scheme.

Irish language Naíonraí are growing rapidly across Ireland. Nearly 4,000 preschoolers attend 278 preschool groups.

====Primary school====
* Junior Infants (age 4–5/5–6)
* Senior Infants (age 5–6/6–7)
* First Class (age 6–7/7–8)
* Second Class (age 7–8/8–9)
* Third Class (age 8–9/9–10)
* Fourth Class (age 9–10/10–11)
* Fifth Class (age 10–11/11–12)
* Sixth Class (age 11–12/12–13)

Primary school children usually start between 8:30 a.m. and 9:20 a.m. Children finish between 1.10 p.m. and 2 p.m. in Junior &amp; Senior infants, while older children spend another hour in school and finish between 2:10 p.m. and 3 p.m.

====Secondary school====
Since 1967, second-level education has been state funded in Ireland. However, schools may charge small fees for trips, mock exams, charity, etc.

=====Junior Cycle=====

The Junior Cycle is a three-year programme, culminating in the Junior Certificate examination. The Junior Certificate examination is sat in all subjects (usually 10 or 11) in early-June, directly after the end of Third Year.
* First Year (age 12–13/13–14)
* Second Year (age 13–14/14–15)
* Third Year (age 14–15/15–16)

=====Transition Year=====

* Transition Year sometimes called Fourth Year (age 15-16/16-17) – depending on school, this may be compulsory, optional or unavailable.

=====Senior Cycle=====
The Senior Cycle is a two-year programme to prepare students for the Leaving Certificate examinations. The Leaving Certificate examinations take place directly after the end of Sixth Year, with the first exam being held on the Wednesday following the June public holiday (the first Monday in June).
* Fifth Year (ages 16–18, or ages 15–17 if Transition Year is skipped)
* Sixth Year (ages 17–19, or ages 16–18 if Transition Year is skipped)

To prepare students for the State examination in both the Senior (Leaving Certificate) and Junior (Junior Certificate) cycles, many schools hold Mock Examinations (also known as Pre-Certificate Examinations) around February each year. These &quot;mocks&quot; are not state examinations: independent companies provide the exam papers and marking schemes – and are therefore not mandatory across all schools.

=====School Day=====
Secondary schools are obliged to have at least 28 hours of tuition time per week. 

Most schools have 40-minute class periods, however an increasing number of schools have adopted 60-minute classes to make timetabling easier for teachers and students. 

The school day generally starts between 08:20 and 09:00 and usually ends between 15:20 and 16:00. There is usually a 10 or 15 minute break between 10:00 and 11:00, and a 30 to 60 minute lunch period between 12:30 and 14:00. Students may have up to nine 40-minute classes per day, or six 60-minute classes, with some schools also having a 10-15 minute registration period during the day. 

Most schools also have a half day on either Wednesdays or Fridays where the school day ends before lunchtime. 

==Primary education==
The Primary School Curriculum (1999) is taught in all schools. The document is prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and leaves to the church authorities (usually the Catholic Church but not universally) the formulation and implementation of the religious curriculum in the schools they control. The curriculum seeks to celebrate the uniqueness of the child:

:&quot;...as it is expressed in each child&#x27;s personality, intelligence and potential for development. It is designed to nurture the child in all dimensions of his or her life—spiritual, moral, cognitive, emotional, imaginative, aesthetic, social and physical...&quot;

The Primary Certificate Examination (1929–1967) was the terminal examination at this level until the first primary-school curriculum, &quot;Curaclam na Bunscoile&quot; (1971), was introduced, though informal standardised tests are still performed. The primary school system consists of eight years: Junior and Senior Infants, and First to Sixth Classes. Most children attend primary school between the ages of four and twelve although it is not compulsory until the age of six. A minority of children start school at three.

In 1990 the first Muslim National School (originally on the South Circular Road, now in Clonskeagh) gained recognition and state funding from the Department of Education, and in 2001 a second Muslim National school was established on the Dominican campus on the Navan road in north Dublin. Both are under the patronage of the Islamic Foundation of Ireland. 2014 saw the establishment of the first independent Muslim primary school in Blanchardstown.

Stratford National School, is the only Jewish-ethos primary school in Ireland, under the patronage of the Dublin Talmud Torah. Due to the small community, only about 50% its pupils are of the Jewish faith.

As recently as 2016, virtually all state-funded primary schools – almost 97 percent – were under church control, with approximately 81% under Roman Catholic control. Irish law allowed schools under church (or other religious ethos) control to consider religion as the main factor in admissions. Oversubscribed schools often chose to admit Catholics over non-Catholics, a situation that created difficulty for non-Catholic families. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva asked James Reilly, the Minister for Children at that time, to explain the continuation of preferential access to state-funded schools on the basis of religion. He said that the laws probably needed to change, but noted it may take a referendum because the Irish constitution gives protections to religious institutions. The issue is most problematic in the Dublin area. A petition initiated by a Dublin attorney, Paddy Monahan, received almost 20,000 signatures in favour of overturning the preference given to Catholic children. An advocacy group, Education Equality, planned a legal challenge.
Ireland&#x27;s main Muslim representative bodies, have praised the Irish education sector and catholic run schools for being accommodating to the needs of pupils from their community.

Reforms in recent years, including an increase in the number of schools with multi- and non-denominational patrons, has meant that the number of Roman Catholic patronage state-funded schools has fallen to approximately 80%.

===Types of school===
Primary education is generally completed at a national school, a multidenominational school, a gaelscoil or a preparatory school.
* National schools date back to the introduction of state primary education in 1831. They are usually controlled by a board of management under diocesan patronage and often include a local clergyman. The term &quot;national school&quot; has of late become partly synonymous with primary school in some parts. Recently, there have been calls from many sides for fresh thinking in the areas of funding and governance for such schools, with some wanting them to be fully secularised.
* &quot;Gaelscoileanna&quot; are a recent movement, started in the mid 20th century. The Irish language is the working language in these schools and they can now be found countrywide in English-speaking communities. They differ from Irish-language national schools in Irish-speaking regions in that most are under the patronage of a voluntary organisation, &quot;Foras Pátrúnachta na Scoileanna Lán-Ghaeilge&quot;, rather than a diocesan patronage. Approximately 6% of primary school children attend Gaelscoils and approximately 3% attend Gaelcholáistí with 187 primary and post-primary schools across the country making it the fastest growing education sector.
* Multidenominational schools are another innovation. They are generally under the patronage of a non-profit limited company without share capital. They are often opened due to parental demand and students from all religions and backgrounds are welcome. Many are under the patronage of voluntary organisations such as &quot;Educate Together&quot; or &quot;An Foras Pátrúnachta&quot;. At least one proposed school has been approved under the patronage of the regional ETB, who generally run vocational secondary schools. In October 2020, general secretary of Education and Training Boards Ireland Paddy Lavelle confirmed that multidenominational state secondary schools, called State&#x27;s Education and Training Boards (ETBs) – formerly called vocational schools – were going to phase out a set of Catholic influences such as mandatory graduation masses, displaying Catholic symbols only, and visits from diocesan inspectors, as described in the &#x27;framework for the recognition of religious belief/identities of all students in ETB schools&#x27;.
* Preparatory schools are independent, fee-charging primary schools that are not reliant on the state for funding. These typically serve to prepare children for entry to fee-charging independent or voluntary secondary schools. Most are under the patronage of a religious order.

As of 2021, mainstream primary schools numbered as follows:
As of 2021, the breakdown of mixed versus single-sex mainstream primary schools numbered as follows:
==Secondary education==
Most students enter secondary school aged 12–13. Most students attend and complete secondary education, with approximately 90% of school-leavers taking the terminal examination, the Leaving Certificate, at age 16–19 (in 6th Year at secondary school). Secondary education is generally completed at one of four types of school:
* Voluntary secondary schools, or just &quot;secondary schools&quot;, are owned and managed by religious communities or private organisations. The state funds 90% of teachers&#x27; salaries. With respect to other running costs, the vast majority of schools have 95% covered by the state with the balance being made up largely through voluntary contributions from pupils&#x27; families, while a minority of schools charge fees for pupils to attend and do not receive state subvention other than teachers&#x27; salaries. These schools cater for 57% of secondary pupils.
* Community colleges, most of which were formerly called vocational schools, are owned and managed by Education and Training Boards, with 93% of their costs met by the state. These schools educate 28% of secondary pupils.
* Comprehensive schools or community schools were established in the 1960s, often by amalgamating voluntary secondary and vocational schools. They are fully funded by the state and run by local boards of management. Nearly 15% of secondary pupils attend such schools.
* Grind schools are fee-charging privately run schools outside the state sector, who tend to run only the Senior Cycle curriculum for 5th and 6th Year students as well as a one-year repeat Leaving Certificate programme.
* Gaelcholáistí are second-level schools (voluntary, vocational or comprehensive) located within English-speaking communities but in which the Irish language is used as the main medium of education. Approximately 3% of secondary students attend these schools.

In urban areas, there is considerable freedom in choosing the type of school the child will attend. The emphasis of the education system at second level is as much on breadth as on depth; the system attempts to prepare the individual for society and further education or work. This is similar to the Education system in Scotland. In 2022, the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) found Ireland to be 2nd in reading and 11th in mathematics in a world survey at the age of 15.

As of 2021, mainstream post-primary schools numbered as follows:
As of 2021, the breakdown of mixed versus single-sex mainstream post-primary schools numbered as follows:
=== Types of programme ===
The document &quot;Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools&quot; published by the Department of Education sets out the minimum standards of education required at this level. Examinations are overseen by the State Examinations Commission. Additional documents set out the standard in each element, module or subject.

==== Junior Cycle====
The Junior Cycle builds on the education received at primary level and culminates with the Junior Certificate Examination. Students usually begin this at the age of 12 or 13. The Junior Certificate Examination is taken after three years of study and not before fourteen years of age. It consists of exams in:
* English
* Irish (Exemption can be granted)
* Maths
As well as a number of chosen subjects:
* Art
* German
* French
* Spanish
* Italian
* Latin
* Ancient Greek
* Classical Studies
* Music
* Business Studies
* Technology
* Home Economics
* Materials Technology (Woodwork, Metalwork)
* Engineering
* Technical Graphics
* History 
* Geography 
* Civic Social and Political Education (CSPE) 
* Religious Education

The selection of optional and compulsory subjects varies from school to school. Most students take around ten examined subjects altogether. Other non-examined classes at Junior Cycle level include Physical Education and Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE).

====Transition Year====
Transition Year is a one-year informal course taken by an increasing number of students usually ages 15 or 16. The content of this is left to the school to model on the local needs. It is compulsory in some schools, optional in some and others do not offer it at all.

Students may attend structured classes, but do not cover material relevant to the Senior Cycle or the Leaving Certificate exams, and therefore students who choose not to do this year are in no way academically disadvantaged when entering the Senior Cycle. The range of activities in Transition Year or Fourth Year differs greatly from school to school, but many include activities such as work experience placements, project work, international trips or exchanges and excursions. Students may participate in courses such as creative writing, sailing, film-making, public speaking and so on, or enter competitions in science, fashion, motor sport and others that would normally be too time-consuming for a full-time student. 

Proponents of TY believe that it allows students an extra year to mature, engage in self-directed learning, explore career options and to choose subjects for senior cycle (the results of the Junior Certificate examination do not become available until midway through September, by which time students not taking Transition Year will already have chosen their classes and begun attending). Opponents believe that a year away from traditional study and the classroom environment can distract students and cause problems when they return to the Senior Cycle. They also believe that the activities undertaken in TY prevent some students from enrolling in this year, as they can be costly and most schools charge a fee of a few hundred euro to cover these activities.

====Senior Cycle====
The Senior Cycle builds on the junior cycle and culminates with the Leaving Certificate Examination. Students normally begin this aged 15–17 the year following the completion of the Junior Cycle or Transition Year. The Leaving Certificate Examination, with required exams in English, Irish, and Maths (barring exemptions), and 3 or 4 optional subjects, is taken after two years of study, usually at the ages of 17–19.

====Typical School Model====

The typical secondary school will consist of First to Third Year (with the Junior Certificate at the end of Third), Transition Year (if offered and taken by the student), and Fifth and Sixth Year (with the Leaving Certificate at the end of Sixth Year).

The vast majority of students continue from lower level to senior level, with only 12.3% leaving after the Junior Certificate. This is lower than the EU average of 15.2%.

Ireland&#x27;s secondary students rank above average in terms of academic performance in both the OECD and EU; having reading literacy, mathematical literacy and scientific literacy test scores better than average. Ireland has the second best reading literacy for teenagers in the EU, after Finland.

==Third-level education==

According to the 2022 US News rankings, Ireland is among the top twenty best countries for education.

==Special needs education==

The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 established the framework for the education of students with special needs.

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) supports students with physical and intellectual disabilities. Some schools provide specific services to students with disabilities. Students with dyslexia are offered additional supports where funding is available.

===Special needs assistant===
A special needs assistant (SNA) is a teaching assistant who has specialised in working with young people in the classroom setting who require additional learning support due to disability.

==Areas of disadvantage==

The Department of Education identifies disadvantaged schools and has schemes in place to provide additional assistance to low-income families and families experiencing financial hardship. Available assistance includes an allowance for school clothing and footwear, assistance with purchasing school books (administered by school principals), exemption from examination fees for the Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate exams, and a &#x27;remote areas boarding grant&#x27; that facilitates students living in remote areas to attend secondary school.

, the European Investment Bank is lending €200 million to finance investment in school buildings around Ireland. The project is part of the Department of Education&#x27;s newest round of school capital investment, which seeks to improve the learning environment for about 23,000 pupils as well as teacher working conditions.

Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS, often in the anacronym form ) is the main policy initiative of the Department of Education to address educational disadvantage. Schools that operate under the Deis scheme are known as Deis schools. The increased resources under the program include reduced class sizes. The program has been in place since 2005. , there were 890 Deis schools with more than 180,000 students. In March 2022, Norma Foley, the minister for education, announced an expansion of the program to include an additional 310 schools (273 primary and 37 post-primary).

==International students==
Schools and universities in Ireland are popular destinations for international students. The country’s universities and colleges have educated many heads of state and government around the world, rivalled only by the United States.

==Holidays==
At primary level, schools are required to open for a minimum of 182 days and 167 at post-primary level. Standard Easter, Christmas and mid-term breaks are published by the Department of Education for the upcoming years. Exact dates vary depending on the school. Generally, Primary and Secondary schools get similar holidays. The year is broken up into three terms:
* From the week in which the 1st of September falls to the week before Christmas.
* From the week after New Year&#x27;s Day to the week before Easter Sunday.
* From the week after Easter Sunday to the end of June for primary level or end of May/start of June for post-primary level to facilitate state exams starting in June.
There is a mid-term break (one week off halfway through a term) around the public holiday at the end of October, two weeks off for Christmas: generally the last week in December and the first week in January, another mid-term break in February, two weeks off for Easter and 8 (primary) or 12 (secondary) weeks of summer holidays. Public Holidays are also taken off.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland, all schools, colleges, universities and childcare facilities closed in March 2020 and remained closed until the end of August/September 2020.

<text>Tegui Calderón Rosario (born February 1, 1972) is a Puerto Rican rapper, singer and actor. He began his musical career in 1996 (as Tego Tec) and was supported by the famous Puerto Rican rapper Eddie Dee, who invited him on his second studio album, &quot;El Terrorista de la Lírica&quot;, released in 2000. Calderón reached international success in 2003 with his first album, &quot;El Abayarde&quot;, which sold 300,000 copies worldwide and was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award. His importance in reggaeton music led him to participate in Eddie Dee&#x27;s &quot;12 Discípulos&quot; album in 2004. He released three more studio albums between 2006 and 2015, varying in styles, focusing more in hip hop and African music rather than reggaeton in &quot;The Underdog/El Subestimado&quot; (2006) and &quot;El Abayarde Contraataca&quot; (2007). His fourth studio album, &quot;El Que Sabe, Sabe&quot;, released in 2015, won a Latin Grammy Award for Best Urban Music Album.

Calderón&#x27;s style is characterized by his social and political themes, with lyrics against corruption in the Puerto Rican government. His themes also include dancing, love, self-reflection and personal experiences.

His film career started in 2007 with his supporting role in &quot;Illegal Tender&quot;. In 2009 he had a lead role in a short film called &quot;Los Bandoleros&quot;, which is part of &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise, and the same year had a cameo appearance in the fourth installment of that franchise, &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot;. In 2011, he reprised his character in a supporting role in &quot;Fast Five&quot;, alongside his colleague and friend Don Omar.

== Early life ==
Calderón was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico. He is the son of Pilar Rosario Parrilla, a schoolteacher, and Esteban Calderón Ilarraza, a government worker for Puerto Rico&#x27;s Department of Health. Moving at a young age from his native Puerto Rico to Miami, Florida, Calderón attended Miami Beach Senior High. Here he was exposed to several different cultures, eventually studying percussion and working as a drummer in a rock band. The band would cover songs produced by artists including Ozzy Osbourne and Led Zeppelin. He has noted that both of his parents were fans of Ismael Rivera, and that his father was also interested in jazz. He was influenced by both genres and incorporated them into his music, including songs such as &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;. He eventually developed a music style that combined elements of salsa, plena, dancehall, and hip-hop, focusing on aspects of urban life in his lyrics.

== Early musical career ==
Calderón&#x27;s career began as a participant in Puerto Rican hip hop contests on television during the 1990s. He met Eddie Dee and DJ Adam who would become his main collaborators, but Calderón was rejected by most producers and deejays at the time. DJ Adam in an interview with Puerto Rican podcaster Chente Ydrach said that Calderón was going to be a part of the underground album DJ Adam&#x27;s &quot;Mad Jam&quot;, but Calderón&#x27;s style was too eccentric and underdeveloped, so he was taken out of the final tracklist.

Calderón signed to Eddie Dee&#x27;s label in 2000, collaborating with Dee on his first hit on Puerto Rican radio, the hip hop song &quot;En Peligro de Extinción&quot; from Dee&#x27;s second album &quot;El Terrorista de la Lírica&quot;.

During 2001-2002, Calderón participated in over a dozen original compilations including gold and platinum albums such as &quot;Kilates&quot;, &quot;Boricuas NY&quot; volumes 1 and 2, &quot;The Majestic&quot;, &quot;La Mision&quot; volumes 2 and 3 and of course his first worldwide crossover hit &#x27;Cosa Buena&#x27; from the &quot;Planet Reggae&quot; production distributed by White Lion Records and Diamond Music. On top of that, he also was featured in the albums of Yaga y Mackie &quot;Sonando Diferente&quot; and Maestro&#x27;s &quot;The Movie&quot; which further accelerated his buzz in the streets.

Thanks to &#x27;Cosa Buena&#x27; and it being one of the first reggaeton videos receiving major rotation on mainstream channels such as Telemundo, in 2002, Calderón became a worldwide phenomenon before his debut album &quot;El Abayarde&quot; in November of that same year creating much hype for his debut. Despite only being available in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and parts of the United States due to White Lion Records (formerly known as Boricua Guerrero and now 100% under Elías de León&#x27;s ownership) being an independent label at the time; Regardless, &#x27;El Abayarde&#x27; became the first hip hop/reggaeton album by a solo artist to sell over 75,000 units in one week with no major label distribution. This success led to Calderón and White Lion signing a joint venture with Sony Music Latin. Calderón formed his own label in the process known as Jiggiri Records under the White Lion banner and distributed by Sony Music Latin. Jiggiri Records would go on to sign and release multi-platinum albums from notable artists such as Zion &amp; Lennox, Voltio and John Eric. Calderón would go on to become one of the most successful touring acts in all of Latin music from 2003-2005, thus further legitimizing the genre now known as reggaeton (once called &#x27;underground&#x27;).

In August 2003, Calderón performed at the Madison Square Garden in New York City. Based on his show and performance, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that he &quot;made the best case for Reggaetón as music with room to grow&quot; being a &quot;forward-looking performer.&quot; His second appearance at the venue was in October 2004, where he headlined an event titled &quot;Megatón 2004&quot;. The concert sold out, with 20,000 in attendance, a mixed crowd of Latino and non-Latino fans.

Calderón&#x27;s travels subsequently led him to Miami, where he incorporated dancehall elements into his musical style. In 2004, his album titled &quot;El Enemy de los Guasíbiri&quot; was released. The album&#x27;s production included a mix of several urban genres. Calderón claimed that he preferred the influence of these other genres due to his belief that Salsa had &quot;become too corporate and too safe&quot;. Years after its release, Calderón stated that he had never approved the release of the &quot;Guasibiri&quot; album, which he claimed was rather a collection of old songs and that it should be left out of his discography as an unauthorized album. Following the release of this album, reggaeton gained more influence with several hip-hop producers in New York. Calderón continued working on several mixtapes, being featured in remixes of Usher&#x27;s &quot;Yeah&quot;, Fat Joe&#x27;s &quot;Lean Back&quot;, N.O.R.E.&#x27;s &quot;Oye Mi Canto&quot; and Akon&#x27;s &quot;I Wanna Love You&quot;, 50 Cent&#x27;s P.I.M.P remix and also Calderón featured Aventura&#x27;s &quot;We Got the Crown&quot;.

== 2005–present ==

Calderón participated on the 2004 and 2005 editions of New York&#x27;s Puerto Rican Day parade. During this timeframe he became the first Latin American artist to be included on New York&#x27;s Power-105. Calderón&#x27;s influence among Latin American youth was noted in a featured published by the Village Voice. The publication claimed that he had &quot;almost single-handedly. .. steered his country&#x27;s dominant youth culture out of the island and Latino neighborhoods, and into the American stream of pop consciousness.” Around this time Calderón still remained a fixture in popular Latin music thanks to international hit such as the Don Omar– led &quot;Bandoleros&quot; (notably included in &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot; soundtrack) and &quot;Quítate Tú Pa Ponerme Yo&quot; from Dee&#x27;s &quot;12 Discípulos&quot; compilation album.

In mid-2005, Calderón signed a joint venture deal between Atlantic Records and his own independent label, Jiggiri Records, for the amount of a million dollars as reported in the Hip Hop/Reggaeton publications of the time. In 2006, he released &quot;The Underdog/El Subestimado&quot;, his second album, containing less reggaeton and more hip hop music. This album featured appearances by Buju Banton, Voltio, Bataklán, Eddie Dee, Luis Cabán, Yandel, Zion, Chyno Nyno, Don Omar and Oscar D&#x27;León. Several producers were involved in the album, including Cookee, Major League, Salaam Remi, Eric Figueroa, Luny Tunes, DJ Nelson, Danny Fornaris, Nesty la Mente Maestra, Naldo, DJ Joe, DJ Fat, Echo and Diesel.

In 2023, Calderón released &quot;La Receta&quot; through Paz y Esperanza and Universal Music Latino.

== Musical styles and themes ==
Although Calderón is a reggaeton artist, he claims to like &quot;all types of music&quot;. Evidence of this is seen both in his biography (he began his career in music in a heavy metal band and attended a school for music as a drummer) as well as in his music, which incorporates &quot;&#x27;several musical tendencies&#x27;&quot;, including sounds and rhythms from places like Africa, Colombia, and the Caribbean. He obtains the sound for his popular reggaeton music through &quot;fusing an experimental reggaeton style strongly rooted in the working-class Caribbean aesthetics of classic salsa with a strong dose of hip-hop&quot;. On &quot;The Underdog/El Subestimado&quot;, he collaborated with rap duo Anónimo Consejo to create a song entitled &quot;Son Dos Alas&quot; which eventually was shortened to an interlude without Calderón.

Calderón has also been praised for his lyrics, which are much more substantive and uplifting, expressing social consciousness. Calderón has been described as &quot;the reggaeton champion of an Afro-Caribbean working-class aesthetic&quot; and is known for lyrics that are equal parts poetry and politics. A consistent link between all of his albums &quot;are the social themes and the untouchable bravado that he usually transmits through his artistic outlook.&quot; According to Tony Touch (legendary hip hop dj and collaborator), &quot;Tego is someone who represents struggle, an underdog... He&#x27;s more of an MC, a product of late-&#x27;80s hip-hop.&quot;

The most prevalent themes among his music, videos, and interviews are the commemoration of blackness and exposition of racism against Latino and Latin American individuals. His essay, &quot;Black Pride&quot;, was first published in the New York Post and discusses the discrimination faced by Black Latinos in Latin America, especially through his own experiences growing up in Puerto Rico. The essay recalls the history of African enslavement and the United States&#x27; Civil Rights Movement to urge Black Latinos to defend their rights and challenge the racism and colorism ingrained in society:This is not about rejecting whiteness rather; it’s about learning to love our blackness – to love ourselves. We have to say basta ya, it’s enough, and find a way to love our blackness. They have confused us – and taught us to hate each other – to self-hate and create divisions on shades and features.

== Film and other career projects ==
Calderón made his acting debut in the film &quot;Illegal Tender&quot; produced by John Singleton. Calderón played the role of Choco, a Puerto Rican gangster whose character was written specifically for him by director Franc. Reyes.

Calderón turned down roles in both &quot;Feel the Noise&quot; and &quot;El Cantante&quot; and instead chose to appear in Illegal Tender out of respect for its producer. After convincing John Singleton that he wanted to appear in a comedy, Calderón was slated to appear in an upcoming Singleton film which casts him as the coach of a baseball team., but the movie was never produced.

Calderón traveled to Sierra Leone along with artists Raekwon and Paul Wall to film a VH1 documentary about diamond mining entitled &quot;Bling&#x27;d: Blood, Diamonds, and Hip-Hop.&quot; The documentary focused on the role of Hip Hop in the blood diamond trade, after the filming concluded Calderón publicly announced that he would no longer wear jewelry. His experience in Africa also changed his outlook on life, which influenced the recording of the track &quot;Alegria&quot;, encouraging fans to not complain about life and recognize that there are other people with bigger problems in their lives.

Calderón and Don Omar are featured in &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot;, &quot;Fast Five&quot; and &quot;The Fate of the Furious&quot;, the fourth, fifth and eighth installments of &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; franchise.

<doc id="480424" wikidata="Q1440192" url="?curid=480424" title="Fox River (Illinois River tributary)">
<text>The Fox River is a tributary of the Illinois River, flowing from southeastern Wisconsin to Ottawa, Illinois in the United States. The Wisconsin section was known as the Pishtaka River in the 19th century. There is another Fox River in Wisconsin that flows through Lake Winnebago into Green Bay. There are also two other &quot;Fox Rivers&quot; in southern Illinois: the Fox River (Little Wabash tributary) and a smaller &quot;Fox River&quot; that joins the Wabash River near New Harmony, Indiana.

The Fox River (Illinois River tributary) is known locally as an excellent fishery with opportunities for Smallmouth Bass, Flathead Catfish, and Walleye. The river’s watershed encompasses 1720 square miles in Illinois and 938 square miles in Wisconsin.

==Wisconsin==
The Fox River rises in the Halbach Swamp, southeast of the community of Colgate, Wisconsin and flows past Brookfield, Waukesha, Big Bend, Waterford, Rochester, Burlington, Wheatland, Silver Lake and Wilmot, for a total of in Wisconsin.

A major dam in Waterford forms a navigable waterway which is one of the busiest in southeastern Wisconsin. The river is generally navigable from the Iron Bridge (now a concrete bridge) in Tichigan, Wisconsin (just south of Big Bend) down to the dam. The river connects several small lakes in this section, and one large lake, Tichigan Lake and one smaller lake, Buena Lake. The entire area including connected lakes and the Fox are often referred to as Tichigan Lake.

At the southern end of this section, Foxwood Isle separates the main dam to its west and a spillway to the east.

A small dam is present just a few miles south in downtown Rochester. The river then flows unobstructed through Burlington, where it joins the White River, and on to Wilmot. This is a popular and picturesque day-canoe trip never straying far from the road, but often just out of sight of it.

Flooding is common on this section of the river, especially near Wheatland to the border.

The Fox River watershed encompasses 938 square miles in Wisconsin.

==Illinois==

The river enters Illinois where it widens into a large area of interconnected lakes known as the Chain O&#x27;Lakes. Fox Lake is the largest village in this area. From the chain, the river flows generally southward for , until it joins the Illinois River at Ottawa. Illinois towns and communities that are on the Fox River include (from north to south): Fox Lake, Johnsburg, McHenry, Holiday Hills, Island Lake, Burtons Bridge, Port Barrington, Cary, Fox River Grove, Algonquin, Carpentersville, West Dundee, East Dundee, Elgin, South Elgin, St. Charles, Geneva, Batavia, North Aurora, Aurora, Montgomery, Oswego, Yorkville, Plano, Millington, Sheridan and Ottawa. Collectively, the area surrounding the Fox River is known as the Fox Valley. Around 1 million people live in this area.

Native American tribes that lived near the Fox River included the Potawatomi, Sac, and Fox tribes.

The Fox River has 15 dams, including McHenry Dam, which raises the river slightly to maintain depth in the Chain O&#x27;Lakes in northern Illinois, the Montgomery Dam and the Dayton Dam, a hydroelectric dam near Ottawa. In September 2023, the United States Army Corps of Engineers issued a draft report recommending the removal of nine of these dams for environmental reasons.

In the winter, bald eagles can be found nesting along the banks.

Early in the history of Illinois, the Fox River provided water for the Illinois and Michigan Canal via a feeder canal, allowing the canal to pass over the Fox River on an aqueduct.

The Fox River watershed encompasses 1720 square miles in Illinois.

<text>Iraqi Airways Flight 163 was a Boeing 737-270C, registered YI-AGJ, that was hijacked in 1986. On 25 December 1986, en route from Baghdad&#x27;s Saddam International Airport to Amman, Jordan, Flight 163 was hijacked by four men. Iraqi Airways security personnel tried to stop the hijackers, but a hand grenade was detonated in the passenger cabin, forcing the crew to initiate an emergency descent. Another hand grenade exploded in the cockpit, causing the aircraft to crash near Arar, Saudi Arabia where it broke in two and caught fire.

There were 106 people on board, and 60 passengers and 3 crew members died. The pilots who survived, and the surviving passengers were able to tell authorities what transpired on the aircraft. The hijacking was one of the deadliest ever, and was one of many in 1985 and 1986.

Shortly after the hijacking, the pro-Iranian group Islamic Jihad Organization (a widely used name for Hezbollah) claimed responsibility. One of the dead hijackers was later identified by the Central Intelligence Agency as a Lebanese national named Ribal Khalil Jallul, whose passport photo was matched to a Hezbollah martyr poster found near a mosque in Beirut. Iraq accused Iran of being behind the attack.

<doc id="480435" wikidata="Q1147392" url="?curid=480435" title="Fox River (Green Bay tributary)">
<text>The Fox River is a river in eastern Wisconsin in the Great Lakes region of the United States. It is the principal tributary of the Green Bay, and via the bay, the largest tributary of Lake Michigan. The city of Green Bay, one of the first European settlements in the interior of North America, is on the river at its mouth on the Green Bay.

Hydrographers divide the Fox into two distinct sections, the Upper Fox River, flowing from its headwaters in south-central Wisconsin northeasterly into Lake Winnebago, and the Lower Fox River, flowing from Lake Winnebago northeasterly to the Green Bay. Together, the two sections give the Fox River a length of . Counting the distance through Lake Winnebago gives a total of .

The river&#x27;s name is the English translation of the French name for the Meskwaki people in the 17th century. The river was part of the famous 1673–74 expedition of Jolliet and Marquette, in which they went on to become the first Europeans to traverse the upper Mississippi River. A particular set of cities on the lower Fox River identify themselves as the Fox Cities.

==Course==
The Upper Fox River begins as a small stream northeast of Pardeeville. It flows west by southwest towards Portage where it comes within of the Wisconsin River before turning north. The Fox River and the Wisconsin River are connected via the Portage Canal, which was the first waterway between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. After flowing past Montello, the river goes northeasterly until reaching Lake Butte des Morts. Here it is joined by the tributary Wolf River before entering the west side of Lake Winnebago at Oshkosh. The Upper Fox flows for a total of .

The Lower Fox begins at the northern end of Lake Winnebago, where it flows north past Neenah, Menasha, and Appleton as it begins its course northeast towards Lake Michigan. The river drops around over this short stretch. Prior to the construction of European-style dams after 1850, the river had many sizable rapids. The Lower Fox ends after flowing through the city of Green Bay and into Lake Michigan through the Green Bay.

==Hydrology==
Altogether, the Fox-Wolf watershed drains an area of about . The Fox has an average annual discharge of into the Green Bay. The highest recorded flow on the Fox near its mouth was on June 3, 1990.

Tributaries of the Fox River include the East, Fond du Lac, Wolf, White, Mecan, Grand, and Montello rivers.

==Name==
The name is the translation of (French for &quot;River of the Foxes&quot;), given by explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette because it went through the territory of the Meskwaki people, called in French. In the Menominee language, the river is known as &quot;Meskwahkīw-Sīpiah&quot;, which means &quot;Red Earth River&quot;. In the Ho-Chunk language (Winnebago, Hoocąk, Hocąk), Fox River is known as &quot;Nionigera&quot;. According to a member of the party of La Salle, it was also called the Kakaling River.

==Demographics==
Along the banks is a chain of cities and villages, including Oshkosh, Neenah, Menasha, Appleton, Little Chute, Kimberly, Combined Locks, and Kaukauna. Except for Oshkosh, located on the Upper Fox River near Lake Winnebago, these cities and villages identify as the Fox Cities. Farther north along the Lower Fox River, from its outlet from Lake Winnebago and before its mouth at Lake Michigan, are the cities of De Pere and Green Bay (located at the lake), and the villages of Ashwaubenon and Allouez; although they are in the Fox River Valley, this grouping of cities and villages does not refer to themselves as Fox Cities.

==History==
Since the recession of the glaciers that once covered much of Wisconsin, the Fox River has supported several Native American cultures, and has been important for its fisheries, waterfowl, wild rice, forests, and water. Archaeologists have claimed that indigenous peoples lived in the Fox River area as early as 7000 BC.

Prior to European settlement in the late 17th century, the shores of the Fox River and the Green Bay were home to roughly half the estimated 25,000 Native Americans who lived in what is today Wisconsin. The first Europeans to reach the Fox were French, beginning with explorer Jean Nicolet in 1634. In 1673 explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet canoed up the river as far as Portage. Here they made the short portage from the Fox to the Wisconsin River and then canoed on toward the Mississippi River. They established an important water route between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River known as the Fox–Wisconsin Waterway. It was likely long used by Native Americans prior to European encounter, as they had extensive cross-country trading routes related to the Mississippi River.

During the French colonization of the Americas, this route was used frequently by fur traders. French-Canadian men who established homes on the Fox River married First Nation women, producing mixed-race descendants who were generally raised within the matrilineal cultures of their mothers and identified with the tribes. In Canada, the Métis of the Red River of the North are classified as a distinct ethnicity because of their shared culture.

===Industrial Revolution===
The Fox-Wisconsin Waterway&#x27;s importance continued into the 1850s, when the Fox and Wisconsin Improvement Company built locks and dams on the Fox and the Portage Canal to connect it to the Wisconsin River at Portage. The company was hoping to establish Green Bay as a port city to rival Chicago by making the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway into the principal shipping route between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River. This goal was never achieved, as the Upper Fox remained too shallow for significant shipping even after damming and dredging. In addition, the lakes that the narrow, winding stream flows through were frozen solid for five months every year.

The Lower Fox was developed instead as a center of riverfront industry. During the mid-19th century, when Wisconsin was a leading producer of wheat, several flour mills were built along the river to harness its abundant water power. During the 1860s, as Wisconsin&#x27;s wheat production declined, these flour mills were replaced by a growing number of paper mills, which processed the great amount of timber being harvested from the forests. The Lower Fox proved an ideal location for paper production, owing to its proximity to lumbering areas that could supply wood pulp to make paper. Several well-known paper companies were founded in cities along the river, including Kimberly-Clark, Northern Paper Mills (makers of Quilted Northern), and the Hoberg Paper Company (manufacturer of Charmin).

The Volcan Street Plant on the Fox river in Appleton was the first Edison hydroelectric station and one of the first in the world. It was put into service in 1882 within the building of the Appleton Paper and Pulp Company.

==Paper industry==
The Lower Fox remains a major area for paper production. There are 24 paper and pulp mills along the Lower Fox River that produce more than five million tons of paper per year and employ around 50,000 people. The principal cities located in this valley are Green Bay, Appleton, Neenah, Menasha, De Pere, and Kaukauna. Although Oshkosh is a major city in the chain, active production of paper products is no longer located there.

==Environmental issues==
In the section between Lake Winnebago and Green Bay at Lake Michigan, the Fox River flows roughly south to north and descends through a height equal to that of Niagara Falls. As such, the Fox River was an ideal location for constructing powerful sawmills that made the Fox River area famous for its paper industry. A negative side effect of this industrialization was the dumping of hazardous material by-products of the paper mills. To repair the ecological damage from this toxic waste, there has been a widespread effort to clean the Fox River. Dredging of the chemicals in the river began on April 28, 2009 and capping started soon after during the summer of 2009. The cleaning project concluded in 2020 and cost an estimated $1 billion. The Fox River will continue to be monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for many years following the cleaning project&#x27;s completion.

The high concentration of paper mills and other industry along the Lower Fox has historically been the source of much pollution of the river. Public debate about this contamination began as early as 1923, but little was done to improve the river until the federal Clean Water Act was passed in 1972. Much effort has since been put into cleaning the Fox, but problems still exist. According to some measures of pollution (e.g. dissolved oxygen, pollution-tolerant worm counts), the Lower Fox River is much cleaner than it was before 1972. However, according to other measures of pollution (e.g., phosphorus, estrogenic compounds, discarded pharmaceuticals), the river waters are slightly more contaminated than before 1972. As a result, debate over the river&#x27;s contamination continues between environmentalists, the paper industry, Indian tribes, and elected officials at the federal, state, and local levels.

While not officially designated as a U.S. Superfund site, the Lower Fox River bottom has some sections contaminated with toxic chemicals. These contaminated sediments are the river&#x27;s current environmental problem. One contaminant of special concern is a group of chemicals called Polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs. The largest deposits of contaminated sediments are traceable to the local paper recycling mills. Beginning in the 1950s, many mills along to Fox River began producing and recycling carbonless copy paper. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources explains that carbonless copy paper caused PCB pollution in the Fox River and Lake Michigan. The federal government banned PCBs in 1979 due to their environmental threat to humans and other wildlife.

The U.S. government and State of Wisconsin filed suit on October 14, 2010, against nine paper companies and two municipalities for their failure to pay for PCB cleanup actions. The companies named in the suit were NCR Corporation, Appleton Papers, CBC Coating, Kimberly-Clark, Menasha Corporation, NewPage Corporation, Glatfelter, U.S. Paper Mills (Sonoco) and WTM (Wisconsin Tissue Mills). The local agencies sued were the City of Appleton and Neenah-Menasha Sewerage Commission. Several settlements ensured that the responsible parties paid for a large sum of the cleaning project costs and other restoration efforts. A settlement, reached in 2019, required that NCR Corporation, P.H. Glatfelter Company, and Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP cover the cost of all future cleaning efforts.

Since the late 19th century, dredging of river bottom sediments has been done to allow large ships to enter the Fox River. The contaminated sediment has been used since the 1960s to fill local wetlands, causing adverse effects on wildlife and plants. After 1978 it was used to develop an off-shore engineered holding area called Renard Isle, also known as Kidney Island. Renard Isle was capped in 2015 and its ownership was transferred to Brown County in 2017. There have been several proposed plans for the land, including turning it into a National Estuarine Research Reserve.

Among the wildlife in the Fox River Valley are birds such as mallard ducks and Canada geese, and fish such as walleye.

Before the 1950s parts of the Fox River were used for recreational purposes. This only lasted for a short period of time as the water quality deteriorated, and the water was considered unhealthy.

The Fox River region has been dominated by dairy farms that benefited from the rich soil and plentiful water supply.

==Recreation==
The Fox River State Recreational Trail is part of the Brown County Park System. The trailhead is in the city of Green Bay where of paved trail follow the Fox River south through the city of De Pere. Biking, walking, jogging, and rollerblading are among the most popular activities on the trail. The trail also has a section of unpaved terrain that permits horseback riding.

The Wiouwash State Trail runs concurrent with the Fox River from downtown Oshkosh to Lake Butte des Morts for about .

===Fishing===
Fishing was a huge aspect of life on the water as many fisheries were set up along the river. This remained large for a short period of time but also was soon limited by water pollution and the depleted amount of fish. Restrictions were placed on how many and what kind of fish could be caught.

The Fox River has produced multiple state records in fishing. Currently the records for Striped bass, Shortnose gar and Northern hogsucker have all been caught in the river.
