<text>William Forsythe (born December 30, 1949) is an American dancer and choreographer formerly resident in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and now based in Vermont. He is known for his work with the Ballet Frankfurt (1984–2004) and The Forsythe Company (2005–2015). Recognized for the integration of ballet and visual arts, which displayed both abstraction and forceful theatricality, his vision of choreography as an organizational practice has inspired him to produce numerous installations, films, and web-based knowledge creation, incorporating the spoken word and experimental music.

==Early life==
William Forsythe was born in New York in 1949, but only started dancing seriously in his later teenage years in college. He followed his grandfather musically as he was a violin prodigy. Forsythe played bassoon, violin, flute, and sang in choruses. He also choreographed for his high school&#x27;s musicals. He began his training in Florida and later continued to dance with Joffrey Ballet. It was while attending college at Jacksonville University, that Forsythe began his formal training as a dancer with Nolan Dingman and Christa Long.

==Life and career==
William Forsythe began studying at the Joffrey Ballet School in New York in 1969 and began his professional career as an apprentice with the Joffrey Ballet in 1971. From 1971 to 1973 danced with Joffrey Ballet II, often appearing in the parent company&#x27;s productions. After this, he followed his then wife, Eileen Brady, joining the Stuttgart Ballet in 1973. Encouraged by the director, Marcia Haydée, Forsythe began choreographing works for the company and in 1976 he choreographed his first piece, &quot;Urlicht&quot;. He became the Stuttgart&#x27;s resident choreographer in 1976 and that same year created his first piece for the company, &quot;Dream of Galilei&quot;. During the next seven years he created original works for the Stuttgart Ensemble, and for ballet companies in Munich, The Hague, London, Basel, Berlin, Frankfurt am Main, Paris, New York, and San Francisco. In 1979, Forsythe choreographed and created his first full-length ballet called &quot;Orpheus&quot;. Forsythe left Stuttgart Ballet in 1980 to choreograph for other companies such as Munich State Opera Ballet, Nederlands Dans Theater, the Frankfurt Ballet, and the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1984 he was appointed director of the government-sponsored Ballet Frankfurt. Forsythe choreographed what is now looked at as his most famous ballet known worldwide. The ballet was titled &quot;In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated&quot; and was commissioned by Rudolf Nureyev starring Sylvie Guillem. In 2002, however, the Frankfurt government began to withdraw its support in order to cut costs and to favor a more conventional dance company. The public protested, but Forsythe decided to move on, and in 2004 the Frankfurt Ballet gave its last performance. After the closure of Ballet Frankfurt in 2004, he founded the Forsythe Company (2005) with the support of the states of Saxony and Hesse, the cities of Dresden and Frankfurt am Main, and private sponsors and which he directed until 2015.

The Forsythe Company, based in Dresden and Frankfurt am Main, was about half the size of the Frankfurt Ballet, but nearly all of its dancers were from that company. Forsythe continued to present his vision to a wide audience. With bases in Frankfurt and Dresden and supported by both state and private funding, the Forsythe Company made its debut in 2005 with the premiere of Forsythe&#x27;s &quot;Three Atmospheric Studies&quot;. A major retrospective of Forsythe&#x27;s work was presented at the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich in 2006, and in subsequent years, his company toured across Europe, appearing in Paris, Zürich, and London. In 2009 London held a monthlong &quot;Focus on Forsythe&quot; celebration that included events across the city, a traveling multimedia installation, and the performance of &quot;Nowhere and Everywhere at the Same Time&quot;, an elaborate installation piece at the Tate Modern, in which dancers weaved through hundreds of suspended pendulums. Forsythe&#x27;s works developed during this time were performed exclusively by The Forsythe Company, while his earlier pieces are prominently featured in the repertoire of virtually every major ballet company in the world, including Mariinsky Ballet, New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, National Ballet of Canada, Dresden Semperoper Ballet, England&#x27;s Royal Ballet, and the Paris Opera Ballet.

Throughout his career, Forsythe has experimented with a freer approach to choreography in which the dancers are allowed to make choices about order and timing comparable to those made by musicians playing a cadenza. As a training tool for dancers, he developed a CD-ROM entitled &quot;Improvisation Technologies&quot; (1995), which in turn resulted in the piece &quot;Self Meant to Govern&quot;, the first part of the evening-length work, Eidos: Telos (1995) which used monitors to provide dancers with verbal cues that spurred movement responses.

Forsythe has produced and collaborated on numerous installation works, including &quot;White Bouncy Castle&quot; (1997, in collaboration with Dana Caspersen and Joel Ryan), &quot;City of Abstracts&quot; (2000), &quot;Nowhere and Everywhere at the Same Time No. 2&quot; (2013) and &quot;Black Flags&quot; (2014). Installation works by Forsythe have been shown at the Whitney Biennial (New York, 1997), Louvre Museum (2006), Tate Modern (London, 2009), ), MoMA (New York 2010), Venice Biennale (2005, 2009, 2012, 2014), Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (2020) and other locations. Forsythe has been commissioned to produce architectural and performance installations by architect-artist Daniel Libeskind, ARTANGEL (London), Creative Time (New York), and the City of Paris. Forsythe is known to teach at universities and cultural institutions as a guest artist. He became one of the Dance Mentors for the Rolex Mentor and Protege Arts Initiative in 2002. Forsythe was also given honorary degrees such as his Doctorate from The Juilliard School in New York City and was given the title Honorary Fellow at the Laban Centre for Movement and Dance in London.

Awards received by Forsythe and his ensembles include the New York Dance and Performance &quot;Bessie&quot; Award (1988, 1998, 2004, 2007) and London&#x27;s Laurence Olivier Award (1992, 1999, 2009). Forsythe has been conveyed the title of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (1999) by the government of France and has received the Hessian Cultural Prize (1995), the German Distinguished Service Cross (1997), the Wexner Prize (2002), the Golden Lion of the Venice Biennale (2010), Samuel H Scripps / American Dance Festival Award for Lifetime Achievement (2012), the Grand Prix de la SACD (2016) and the German theatre prize DER FAUST Lifetime Achievement Award (2020).

Between 2015 and 2021, Forsythe was professor at the University of Southern California&#x27;s newly created Glorya Kaufman School of Dance and artistic advisor at the university&#x27;s Choreographic Institute. Moreover, in 2015 The Forsythe Company changed its name to Dresden Frankfurt Dance Company and continued under the directorship of choreographer Jacopo Godani.

==Style==
Forsythe believes that classical ballet is a language with rules to follow. However, although he is trained with these rules, he is much more interested in bending and eventually breaking these guidelines. His style is based on classical ballet, using traditional positions, but developing them to the extreme. Many of his pieces are danced on pointe, but he has used all kind of footwear, including work-boots, socks, and slippers, in order to explore different choreographic results. Forsythe&#x27;s choreographic style is both postmodern and deconstructivist. Similar to the style of other postmodernists, Forsythe plays with the unexpected, moments of improvisation, and he emphasizes process within the creation of his works. The extreme positions involved in his ballets require a great deal of flexibility, and, in fact, most of his dancers possess that skill.

Forsythe&#x27;s early work in Stuttgart was created mostly for commission, and all of these early works were neoclassical. However, even in these early years, Forsythe states that he was criticized for creating work that was too modern. As his career progressed Forsythe shifted the focus to the methods of his working, which included space and dynamics. Forsythe&#x27;s choreographic style often includes political themes. He believes that the rehearsal space is inherently political because each individual lives their politics through their everyday behaviors. In an interview Forsythe said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t about to go into politics, but I could perform a political experiment locally.&quot; The movement style itself drew inspiration from the work of George Balanchine. Forsythe was drawn to the musicality, speed, and lightness of Balanchine&#x27;s work. Forsythe&#x27;s emphasis on space is evident in his big, long, and exaggerated movements. Very fast footwork, and shaped hands—often with the lines broken at the wrists—are at the base of his vocabulary. The arms are intended to lead many of the movements within this technique, unlike the more classical teachings of moving the arms and legs simultaneously.

Weight change plays a major part in his work, which is especially evident in his partner-work. The dancers stretch and pull each other far from their center-lines, with the idea being that each will pull the other so far from center that a counterbalance is created between them. This element of counterbalance contrasts with more classical partnering techniques that mainly focus on keeping the ballerina upright and helping her to maintain her balance.

While Forsythe deconstructs the classical technique of ballet, he additionally challenges social norms and the representation of these norms within art. For example, in his work &quot;Behind the China Dogs&quot;, Albert Evans dances with lean and fluid movements—qualities typically viewed as feminine—as Helene Alexopaulos moves fiercely, and with muscular movements—qualities typically viewed as &quot;masculine&quot;. In all of his work, the dancers are prompted to extend their limbs past their kinespheres, stretching the arms and legs away from the torso.

From a structural point of view, he likes to play with the expectations of the audience. In the second act of &quot;Artifact&quot; (1984), for example, he raises and lowers the curtains in the middle of the dance, in order to change drastically the environment on stage, and willingly lights the dancers.

Most of Forsythe&#x27;s pieces use electronic scores composed by Thom Willems. Forsythe and Willems both believe that music and dance are independent from each other, and that, even though they coincide in dynamics and length, neither of the two is there to illustrate the other. Their main concern is the inner structure of their works, so they leave the emotional interpretation to the audience or the listener.

==Dance and visual arts==
William Forsythe is also known for his work in combining the choreographic and visual arts. He has produced and collaborated on numerous installation works, which he refers to as &quot;Choreographic Objects,&quot; including &quot;White Bouncy Castle&quot; (1997, in collaboration with Dana Caspersen and Joel Ryan), &quot;City of Abstracts&quot; (2000), &quot;Scattered Crowd&quot; (2002), &quot;The Fact of Matter (2009), Nowhere and Everywhere at the Same Time No. 2&quot; (2013), &quot;Black Flags&quot; (2014) and &quot;Underall&quot; (2017). Installation works by Forsythe have been shown at the Whitney Biennial (New York, 1997), Louvre Museum (2006), Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich (2006), 21_21 Design Sight in Tokyo (2007), Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus (2009), Tate Modern (London, 2009), ), MoMA (New York 2010), Venice Biennale (2005, 2009, 2012, 2014), 20th Biennale of Sydney (2016), Museum Folkwang (2019), Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (2020) and Kunsthaus Zürich (2021) and other locations. Forsythe has been commissioned to produce architectural and performance installations by architect-artist Daniel Libeskind, ARTANGEL (London), Creative Time (New York), and the City of Paris.

Forsythe collaborated with different educators and media specialists in order to create new ways to document dance. His first online program was a computer application titled &quot;Improvisation Technologies: A Tool for the Analytical Dance Eye&quot;, which he created in 1994. This application was used by professional companies, dance conservatories, universities, postgraduate architecture programs, and secondary schools throughout the world, and it was the inspiration for his later application &quot;Synchronous Objects&quot;. &quot;Synchronous Objects&quot; was launched in 2009, and &quot;One Flat Thing&quot; was reproduced on a digital online score developed by Ohio State University. The process was revealed, and people began to discover that the choreographic scores and the principles of choreography itself could be applied to other fields. After the success of &quot;Synchronous Objects&quot; came Forsythe&#x27;s &quot;Motion Bank&quot;. Motion Bank is a research platform with a focus on creating and researching online digital scores in collaboration with guest choreographers.

<doc id="477191" wikidata="Q6541558" url="?curid=477191" title="Liberty (libertarian magazine)">
<text>Liberty is an American libertarian journal founded in 1987 by R. W. Bradford (who was the magazine&#x27;s publisher and editor until he died from cancer in 2005) in Port Townsend, Washington, and then edited from San Diego by Stephen Cox. Unlike &quot;Reason&quot;, which is printed on glossy paper and has full-color photographs, &quot;Liberty&quot; was printed on uncoated paper stock and had line drawing cartoons by S. H. &quot;Scott&quot; Chambers and Rex F. &quot;Baloo&quot; May, no photographs except for advertisements, and only one extra color (blue), which was limited to the cover and occasionally a few ads. Beginning in November 2010, the magazine transitioned to an online-only format.

==History==
Bradford had planned the launch of &quot;Liberty&quot; for several years during the 1980s, waiting in part for the development of desktop publishing software to make the endeavor cost-effective for a short-run periodical. The magazine achieved Bradford&#x27;s target circulation by the end of the first year of publication. Starting it as an arm of his private publishing business, he turned the magazine over to a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation (under his control) in 1993. Until late 1998, &quot;Liberty&quot; published bimonthly. In 1999, it moved from a bimonthly to a monthly publication schedule. Beginning in 2008, the print version was published eleven times a year, with one issue being a double issue. Beginning in November 2010, the magazine transitioned to an online-only format that does not arrange content into separate monthly or bimonthly issues.

The magazine&#x27;s list of editors at start-up included Murray Rothbard; Karl Hess joined soon after. Both wrote for the magazine and both were featured prominently in subscription advertising. Rothbard left the masthead in 1990, following his break with the Libertarian Party and his public move towards paleolibertarianism; Hess stayed with the magazine until his death.

From the beginning, &quot;Liberty&quot; gave extensive coverage to the history of the libertarian movement, repeatedly focusing on the biography and legacy of Ayn Rand. The magazine offered the first printing of Rothbard&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult&quot; as its first subscription bonus. John Hospers&#x27;s two-part series &quot;Talking With Ayn Rand&quot; was among the magazine&#x27;s notable early publishing coups. Characteristically, Bradford juxtaposed scholarly, intellectual writing from philosophers such as Loren Lomasky and Jan Narveson and economists such as Mark Skousen, Doug Casey, Leland B. Yeager, and David D. Friedman, with work by young, virtually unknown amateur writers. With few exceptions, the magazine does not pay writers for their contributions.

<doc id="477194" wikidata="Q14980882" url="?curid=477194" title="North American FJ-2/-3 Fury">
<text>The North American FJ-2 and FJ-3 Fury are a series of swept-wing and carrier-capable fighters for the United States Navy and Marine Corps. The FJ-2 resulted from an effort to navalize the North American F-86 Sabre operated by the United States Air Force. These aircraft feature folding wings, and a longer nose landing strut designed to increase angle of attack upon launch and to accommodate a longer oleo to absorb the shock of hard landings on an aircraft carrier deck.

Although sharing a U.S. Navy designation with its distant predecessor, the straight-winged North American FJ-1 Fury, the FJ-2/-3 were completely different aircraft (the later FJ-4 was again, a complete structural redesign of the FJ-3). The FJ-2 was one of the aircraft used to evaluate the first steam catapult on a US Navy aircraft-carrier.

==Design and development==

===FJ-2===
By 1951, the Navy&#x27;s existing straight-wing fighters were inferior in performance to the swept-wing Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 then operating in the Korean War; the swept-wing fighters in the Navy&#x27;s development pipeline, such as the Vought F7U Cutlass and Grumman F9F Cougar, were not yet ready for deployment.

As an interim measure, the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics ordered a direct development of the swept-wing North American F-86E Sabres as the FJ-2. As the F-86 had not been designed to be carrier-capable, this involved some risk, but Navy pilots had observed that the F-86A actually had a lower landing speed than the Grumman F9F Panther. During carrier qualification trials the Navy informed Grumman that if the F9F-5 stall speed was not reduced by it would be removed from carrier operations at the same time that the FJ-2 was already making its debut into navy squadrons. North American&#x27;s chief engineer at the time stated that the swept-wing Sabre had handling and stall characteristics at low speeds comparable to the best straight winged airplanes. The urgency behind the program was such that 300 (later reduced to 200) FJ-2 fighters were ordered before the prototypes had flown.

The first prototype to fly was actually the third aircraft ordered: Designated XFJ-2B and first flown on 27 December 1951, it differed only from a standard F-86E-10 in its armament, having four Colt Mk 12 cannons instead of the six Colt-Browning M3 machine guns of the Sabre. The second and third aircraft to fly were designated XFJ-2 and lacked armament, but were modified to be carrier-capable. They had arrester hooks and longer nosewheel legs to increase angle of attack at take-off and landing, and catapult fittings. In August 1952 carrier trials were flown on , followed by carrier qualification trials on in October–December 1952. Results were less than satisfactory: Low-speed handling was poor, while the arrester hook and nose gear leg weren&#x27;t strong enough.

The first production aircraft flew on 22 November 1952. This FJ-2 incorporated further modifications for carrier operations: The track of the main landing gear was widened by eight inches, the outer wing panels folded upward, and the windscreen was modified to give the pilot a better view during approach. The FJ-2 also featured an all-moving &quot;flying tail&quot; without dihedral. Because of problems experienced during launches with steam catapults, a number of FJ-2 later received a stronger nosewheel strut. Outwardly, the FJ-2 was hard to distinguish from an F-86, apart from navy paint and the gun muzzles of the cannons. The engine was the General Electric J47-GE-2, a navalized version of the J47-GE-27 used in the F-86F. The naval modifications of the FJ-2 had increased weight by about over the F-86F, but had not succeeded in delivering a fully carrier-capable fighter. A decision had already been made to give it to land-based squadrons of the US Marine Corps.

Construction was slowed due to demand for the F-86 in Korea; the FJ-2 was not produced in large numbers until after that conflict had concluded. Only seven aircraft had been delivered by the end of 1953, and it was January 1954 before the first aircraft was delivered to a United States Marine Corps squadron, VMF-122. The Navy preferred the lighter F9F Cougar due to its superior slow-speed performance for carrier operations, and the 200 FJ-2 models built were delivered to the Marines. The Marines did make several cruises aboard carriers and tried to solve the type&#x27;s carrier handling problems, but the FJ-2 was never really satisfactory. In 1956, the FJ-2 already disappeared from front-line service, and reserve units retired it in 1957.

===FJ-3===

Even while development of the FJ-2 was ongoing, the development was planned of a version powered by the Wright J65, a license-built version of the British Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet. The Sapphire promised to deliver 28% more thrust than the J47, for little gain in weight. The new version was designated FJ-3, and an order for 389 aircraft was placed in March 1952.

To test the new engine a single FJ-2, BuNo 131931, was modified, but the first true production FJ-3 flew on 3 July 1953. The only externally visible change required by the new engine was a deeper intake to accommodate the larger mass flow. Early FJ-3s had the same wing as the FJ-2, but from 1955 onwards the FJ-3 was built with a so-called &quot;6-3&quot; wing, with a leading edge that was extended at the root and at the tip. This modification, first introduced on the F-86F, enhanced maneuverability at the expense of a small increase in landing speed due to deletion of the leading edge slats. The version introduced on the FJ-3 was different from that fitted to the F-86F, as camber was applied to the underside of the leading edge to improve low-speed handling. On the FJ-3, the new wing leading edges also held extra fuel. From the 345th aircraft onwards, the wings were provided with four stations for external loads, up to on the inboard stations and on the outboard stations.

Deliveries began in September 1954, and the FJ-3 joined the fleet in May 1955. An FJ-3 was the first fighter to land aboard the new supercarrier in 1956. Problems were encountered with the J65 engine, including failures of its lubrication system under the acceleration of launch or during manoeuvres, and failures of the turbine blades. Nevertheless, the Navy was more satisfied with the FJ-3 than it had been with the FJ-2, and in March 1954 ordered an additional 149 aircraft. Because of its more powerful engine, the FJ-3 was superior to most models of the F-86, except the F-86H. A total of 538 FJ-3s were built. Of these 194 were modified to FJ-3Ms with the ability to carry AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. Some FJ-3s were later modified to control Regulus missiles (KDU-1), and Grumman F9F-6K Cougar target drones. In 1956 the Navy retro-fitted all its FJ-3s with probe-and-drogue air refueling equipment, a long probe being fitted under the left wing.

<text>The MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video was one of four original general awards that have been handed out every year since the first MTV Video Music Awards in 1984. In 2007, though, the award was briefly renamed Male Artist of the Year, and it awarded the artist&#x27;s whole body of work for that year rather than a specific video. However, the award returned to its original name the following year. It was replaced by the Artist of the Year category in 2017, combining Best Male and Best Female video categories.

With three victories, Eminem is the artist with most wins in this category, and also has the most nominations with nine. Meanwhile, Tom Petty, Beck, Will Smith, Justin Timberlake and Chris Brown, all have won this twice, with the first three being the only artists to win the award for two consecutive years.

==Recipients==

<text>Charles Maurice Lisner OBE (1928 - 1988) was a French-Australian dancer and the founder and first artistic director of the Queensland Ballet.

== Early life ==
Charles Lisner was born in Paris in 1928 and emigrated to Australia with his parents in 1937. He started dancing late in life, first becoming a pupil of Borovansky, and later joined his company. In 1947, Lisner traveled to London where he spent time with the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet and dance with The Royal Ballet.

== Creation of Lisner Ballet Academy and Queensland Ballet ==
In 1953, Lisner returned to Queensland after the death of his father, and established the Lisner Ballet Academy with virtually no money. From that academy grew Lisner&#x27;s privately owned company, the Lisner Ballet, which was established in 1960. The company was the first professional state company in Australia to tour regional centres throughout the country.

In 1962, the company was renamed Queensland Ballet. Lisner stepped down as Artistic Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company in 1974.

Lisner married Valerie, one of his dancers. He was an uncredited dancer in the film, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948) 

He was appointed OBE in the 1976 New Year Honours.

Many photographs of the academy were taken by Grahame Garner, as a regular photographer for the Queensland Guardian newspaper. 911 negatives from his collection of the Lisner Academy were lodged with the National Library of Australia in 2009.

<text>The [[MTV Video Music Award]] for Best Female Video is one of the original general awards that has been handed out every year since the first annual MTV Video Music Awards in 1984.

In 2007, however, the award was briefly renamed Female Artist of the Year, and it awarded the artist&#x27;s whole body of work for that year rather than a specific video. In 2008, though, the award returned to its original name and was once again awarded for a specific video.

The category would become defunct beginning with the 2017 ceremony after the gender specific categories would be merged into the Artist of the Year category.

Madonna, Taylor Swift and Beyoncé are the biggest winners with three wins each, while the former also holds the record for most nominations with 12. Meanwhile, Beyoncé, Kelly Clarkson and Lady Gaga are the only artists to win the award for two consecutive years.

<doc id="477201" wikidata="Q2598885" url="?curid=477201" title="List of Farscape episodes">
<text>&quot;Farscape&quot; is a science fiction television show. Four regular seasons were produced, from 1999 to 2003. Each season consists of 22 episodes. Each episode is intended to air in a one-hour television timeslot (with commercials), and runs for 44 to 50 minutes. The regular seasons were followed by &quot;&quot; in 2004, a 2 part miniseries with an air time of 3 hours. Several of the early episodes of Season One were aired out of the intended order. As the official Farscape website lists them in the production order as opposed to airing order, the list below reflects that.

== Series overview ==
== Episodes ==

=== Season 1 (1999–2000) ===
=== Season 2 (2000–01) ===
=== Season 3 (2001–02) ===
The premiere of season three was preceded with a one-hour recap titled &quot;Farscape Undressed&quot; for new audiences.
=== Season 4 (2002–03) ===
=== The Peacekeeper Wars ===

Following the series&#x27; unexpected cancellation in September 2002, a miniseries was produced to wrap up the season four cliffhanger and tie up some elements of the series in general. &quot;The Peacekeeper Wars&quot; was broadcast on 17 and 18 October 2004.

<text>The [[MTV Video Music Award]] for Best Group (also known as the MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video and MTV Video Music Award for Group of the Year) is given to recording artists at the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs). The award was introduced at the inaugural ceremony in 1984 by vocalist Ric Ocasek of the Cars. American rock band ZZ Top was the first act to receive the honor for its &quot;Legs&quot; music video. Tim Newman, the video&#x27;s director, accepted the award on behalf of the band.

In 2007, a revamp of the ceremony saw the award renamed from Best Group Video to simply Best Group. In 2008, the VMAs returned to their original format, but the award was not included. It was brought back for the 2019 edition of the show, as one of three social-media voted categories, instead of being determined by industry personnel as in previous years. In 2021, it was renamed from Best Group to Group of the Year, though it was changed back to Best Group in 2024.

BTS is the most-awarded artist in this category, having won the award four times, and is the only nominee to win the award in consecutive years, from 2019 to 2022. U2 is the most-nominated act, with seven of its videos receiving nominations in six different years between 1985 and 2005. TLC was the first girl group to win the award, doing so twice with their videos for &quot;Waterfalls&quot; (1995) and &quot;No Scrubs&quot; (1999). Blackpink is the most-nominated girl group, having received five nominations from 2019 to 2023, and was the second girl group after TLC to win the award in 2023.

<doc id="477204" wikidata="Q754448" url="?curid=477204" title="Haa District">
<text>Haa District (Dzongkha: ཧཱ་རྫོང་ཁག; Wylie: &quot;Haa rzong-khag;&quot; alternative spellings include &quot;Ha&quot;) is one of the 20 dzongkhag or districts comprising Bhutan. An alternative name for the district is &quot;Hidden-Land Rice Valley.&quot; It the second least-populated dzongkhag in the country after Gasa. 

The most-spoken language of the district is Dzongkha.

The river Haa Chhu, originating at Jomolhari mountain, flows through the district.

==Mystical history of Haa==
The name Haa (pronounced &quot;hah&quot;), as well as the more ancient name &quot;Has&quot; (Dzongkha: ཧས་; Wylie: &quot;Has&quot;; pronounced &quot;hay&quot;), connotes esoteric hiddenness. Haa&#x27;s major feature is the Haa Valley, a steep north-south valley with a narrow floor. The district is presided over by three mountains collectively referred as &quot;Three Brothers&quot; -- &quot;Jampelyang, Chana-Dorji, and Chenrezig.&quot;

===Black, White, and Haa Gonpa temples===
Local historians maintain that two important temples in Haa District, the Black Temple (lhakhang Nagpo) and the White Temple (lhakhang karpo), were built at the same time as Kyerchu Temple in Paro in the 7th century AD. The two temples can be found near each other at the sacred site known as &quot;Miri Punsum&quot;, or &quot;The Three Brother Hills&quot;. A third temple, &quot;Haa Gonpa&quot;, was built further up the valley at the site where a lame pigeon, actually a bodhisattva in disguised form, was found by a local farmer who was drawn to the spot by a mysterious fire seen on several successive nights and by the unexplained sounds of oboes and trumpets (musical instruments closely associated with Bhutanese and Tibetan monasteries).

During the 10th day of the 11th month of the Bhutanese calendar (see Tibetan calendar), liturgical ceremonies worshipping Amitabha Buddha are held at Haa Gonpa temple.

===Sacred oak and the upper house===
Near the Black Temple there are two houses near a sacred oak tree where the local deity once appeared as a winged creature, scaring the local people (the valley is divided into a number of areas, each under the influence of a particular local deity predating the arrival of Buddhism — see Bön religion). The residents of the two houses gave offerings to the local deity. The local deity, now appeased, visited the upper house while neglecting the lower. The jealous owner of the lower house began an inter-house feud in which a man of the upper house was killed. Every year 11th lunar month a series of special mystical practices are performed in the upper house for a week.

===The local deity Chungdue===
The famous Lam Pema Lingpa also documented the activities of another local deity known as &quot;Aup Chungdue&quot;. Chungdue was responsible for meteor storms, cyclones, wildfires, rocks splitting apart, earthquakes, and a number of other mystical disasters. The Guru Padmasambhava arrived in the late 8th century and subdued the deity. However the deity&#x27;s force is not to be taken lightly. In the 15th century aup Chungdue decreed that the people of Ha Shogona village where not to come in contact with any followers of a certain monk in nearby Paro dzongkhag. When a young Haa man married a girl from Paro they believed no harm would come to them. However, as they crossed a river between the two districts the knots tying her infant to her back suddenly came loose and the baby fell into the river and drown.

===Other features===
Also near the Black and White temples is a special stupa chorten marking the site where an imprint of Guru Padmasambhava&#x27;s body and hat may be found in a large rock.In the Samar side-valley may be found a bridge known as &quot;Has Samarpudung&quot;. Below the bridge is the lake of a wishing cow whose stone udders can be seen in the lake.

== Population ==
According to Census 2017, the population of the district was 13,655 in 2,952 households making it the second least populated dzongkhag in the country after Gasa.

==Economy==

=== Pastoralism ===
In the northern part of the district, a temperate alpine area, yak rearing is the most sustainable occupation. Natural selection has given the yak a physiological design that makes its adaption to high mountains unrivalled by any other livestock. The pastoralists were inclined to keep an unexpectedly high number of male yaks due to the high price of yak meat. In 1993, the price for boneless yak meat stood at Nu 65 per kilogram, i.e. more than four times higher than beef. In the northern gewogs, the population also depend on making butter and cheese for their livelihood.

=== Agriculture ===
Most of the district is unsuitable for agriculture. Traditionally, the main cereals grown in the dzongkhag was bitter and sweet buckwheat, barley, and wheat. In 2018, the cultivable land was around 2% of the total area in the district. Agriculture is further constrained by the prolonged winter and shorter growing seasons. Wheat is the main cereal crop grown in the district; other cereals crops are bitter barley and sweet buckwheat. Some rice is grown in the lower reaches of the valley. Potatoes, chilis, apples and other cash crops are grown by farmers on the valley floor, along terraced hillsides, and in some of the more accessible side valleys. Per the census, almost every household owns livestock of some type, most commonly yaks and cattle, but also chickens, pig, and horses. In the southern part of the district, cardamom and ginger constitute principal cash crops, while potato serves as the main cash crop in the north. Apples and vegetables are also cultivated on a moderate scale.

78% of Haa is covered with forest, and forestry plays an important part in local economy.

==Geography==
Haa District lies along the western border of Bhutan. To the northwest it is bounded by Tibet, to the southwest by Samtse District, to the southeast by Chukha District, and to the northeast by Paro District. Haa Dzongkhag covers a total area of 1905 sq km. The southern part of the district covers some sub-tropical area. However, the district is largely a temperate alpine area. Its northern part is above the tree line.

The gewogs of Bji, Katsho, Eusu, and Samar are in the north while Gakidling and Sombaykha are in the south.

==Administrative divisions==
Haa District is divided into six village blocks (or &quot;gewogs&quot;):

*Bji Gewog
*Gakiling Gewog
*Katsho Gewog
*Sama Gewog
*Sangbay Gewog
*Uesu Gewog
== Tourism ==

In 2002, subsequent to the 79th session of the National Assembly, the valley was opened to foreign tourism. The dzongkhag has 41 lhakhangs, which are owned by the government, community and private individual. The gewogs of Bje, Kar-tshog, Eusu and Samar Gewogs are within radius of 15 km from dzongkhag administration. They have fairly good road network, electricity, telephone connectivity, water supply, and health facilities.

The Haa District is a destination for tourists, offering scenery, cultural heritage, and outdoor activities. Attractions in the district include:

Cultural Exploration:

The Haa District is known for its rich cultural heritage, including its various festivals, monasteries, and traditional architecture. Some of the prominent cultural attractions include:

* &#x27;Lhakhang Karpo and Nagpo: These twin temples, also known as the White and Black Temples, are considered sacred and are an important pilgrimage site. They showcase intricate Bhutanese architecture.
* &#x27;Rongtse Nye: Rangtse Ney is a sacred abode of Guru Rinpoche and Khandro Yeshe Tsogyel in Haa district at an altitude of 1200 meters.
* &#x27;Haa Summer Festival&#x27;: Held annually in July, this festival celebrates the culture and traditions of the Haa Valley. It features traditional music, dance performances, local cuisine, and exhibitions of traditional crafts.
* &#x27;Tagchu Goemba: Located on a hilltop, this ancient monastery has extensive views of the Haa Valley. Visitors can explore its surroundings, wall paintings, and engage with the resident monks to learn about Buddhism in Bhutan.
Nature and Outdoor Activities:

Some popular activities in the Haa District include:

* Hiking and Trekking: The district has a number of trails for hiking and trekking. Trails like the Haa Wangchulo Dzongkhag Trek and the Shekhar Drak Trek allow visitors to explore the region while viewing its mountains, valleys, and meadows.
* Photography and Bird Watching: The Haa Valley&#x27;s landscapes have diverse flora and fauna which district also attract birdwatchers. Species like the Satyr Tragopan, Blood Pheasant, and Himalayan Monal have been spotted in the region.
* Haa valley–Saga La–Drukgyal Dzong trek is a trek of 23km that can be covered in two to three days. This trek is also called the &#x27;Haa Planters&#x27; Trail&#x27; as it was used by rice planters from the valley to reach Paro to work as farm labourers during the planting season (mainly May-June). In return, the people of Haa received red rice after the autumn harvest. The trek passes through villages in the valley and dense forests near Paro. The trek ends near Drukgyal Dzong. On a three-day trek, one can stop at Yangtong. Alternatively, one can also stay at Khadey Ghom. The trek on the second day can end at Dongney Tsho.
* The ‘Haa Panorama Hiking Trail’ (HPHT) is a one-day hiking trail that overlooks four major monasteries of upper Haa: Yangthang, Katsho, Dranadingkha and Takchu goenpas[1]. The hike could either start from Yangthang goenpa or Wangtsa village through thick pine covering and provides a bird’s eye view of Haa valley. It ascends to 3,150 metres above sea level and passes through Juney Drak, Katsho and Yanthang goenpas, and the trail covers 11 kilometres in about five hours. ----[1] https://kuenselonline.com/a-new-trail-to-explore-in-haa/

Other treks that start from the valley include Haa valley–Nub Shona Patta Tho–Rigona, and Haa Valley–Amo Chhu–Phuentsholing.
Homestays and Local Experiences:

Tourists can opt for homestays in Haa District. Local families welcome visitors into their homes, offering a chance to experience Bhutanese hospitality, taste traditional cuisine, and participate in local activities.

==Environment==
Haa contains Torsa Strict Nature Reserve, one of the environmentally protected areas of Bhutan. Torsa contains no human inhabitants other than military patrols and posts, occupying substantial portions of the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Bji and Sangbay. Torsa is connected to Jigme Dorji National Park via biological corridor, cutting across the northeastern half of Haa District.

==Military==
The Indian Army maintains a military base in the valley to maintain security against incursions from China. The Chinese military has built roads into the Torsa Strict Nature Reserve and Haa District over the past dozen years clearly visible on Google Earth/Maps and other viewing platforms.

<text>The [[MTV Video Music Award]] for Best Concept Video was first given out in 1984, awarding the best videos that involved the conceptual interpretation of a song.

As the years went on, however, the majority of videos aired on MTV became concept videos, and so the need for this category diminished.

The category was retired in 1988.

With three nominations, Talking Heads are the most nominated act in this category.

<text>The Douglas F3D Skyknight (later redesignated F-10 Skyknight) is an American twin-engined, mid-wing jet fighter aircraft designed and manufactured by the Douglas Aircraft Company.

It was designed in response to a 1945 United States Navy requirement for a jet-powered, radar-equipped, carrier-based night fighter. Douglas designed the aircraft around the bulky air intercept radar systems of the era, resulting in a wide, deep, and roomy fuselage that accommodated its two-man crew. An initial contract was issued to Douglas on 3 April 1946. The &quot;XF3D-1&quot; prototype performed its maiden flight on 23 March 1948. During June 1948, a production contract for 28 &quot;F3D-1&quot; production aircraft was received. It was equipped with a Westinghouse AN/APQ-35 fire control system, which incorporated three separate radars and was an essential component of its night fighter operations.

The F3D saw service with the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. Its primary mission was to locate and destroy enemy aircraft at night. The Skyknight was not produced in great numbers, yet it achieved numerous firsts in its role as a night fighter during the Korean War, where the type frequently escorted Boeing B-29 Superfortresses on night bombing missions. While it never achieved the fame of the North American F-86 Sabre, it downed several Soviet-built MiG-15s as a night fighter over Korea. It only sustained a single air-to-air loss against a Chinese MiG-15, which occurred on the night of 29 May 1953. A total of 237 F3D-2s were completed before production was terminated on 23 March 1952.

The Skyknight played an important role in the development of the radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow missile, which led to further guided air-to-air missile developments. It also served as an electronic warfare platform in the Vietnam War as a precursor to the EA-6A Intruder and EA-6B Prowler. The aircraft is sometimes unofficially called &quot;Skynight&quot;, dropping the second &quot;k&quot;. The unusual, portly profile earned it the nickname &quot;Willie the Whale&quot;. Some Vietnam War U.S. Marine veterans have referred to the Skyknight as &quot;Drut&quot;, whose meaning becomes obvious when read backwards. This may be in reference to its age, unflattering looks, or the low-slung air intakes that made it vulnerable to foreign object damage (FOD).

==Design and development==
===Origins===
The F3D was not intended to be a typical sleek and nimble dogfighter, but as a standoff night fighter, being outfitted with a powerful radar system and a second crew member. It originated in 1945 with a US Navy requirement for a jet-powered, radar-equipped, carrier-based night fighter. The Douglas team led by Ed Heinemann designed the aircraft around the bulky air intercept radar systems of the time, placing the pilot and radar operator in side-by-side seating. The result was an aircraft with a wide, deep, and roomy fuselage. Aviation author Joe Copalman observed that the F3D was a relatively conventional aircraft, despite its use of jet propulsion, the design team having opted for features such as a straight wing and traditional tail unit.

A large and relatively flat forward windshield was used; while not conducive to high speed flight, it provided distortion-free external visibility, something that was particularly valued for a night fighter at that time. The design team opted not to use tip tanks due to the fuselage already permitting sufficient fuel capacity and the difficulty involved in properly combining the tanks with a folding wing mechanism. The use of ejection seats was also considered but decided against as their inclusion would have necessitated a jettisonable canopy, made pressurizing the cockpit more difficult, and added weight. Instead, an escape tunnel was used, similar to the arrangement used in the Douglas A-3 Skywarrior. The stick was extendable so that more force could be exerted upon it by the pilot as a fallback measure in the event of a hydraulic failure.

The XF3D-1 was selected over a competing submission, Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation&#x27;s &quot;G-75&quot; twin-seat, four-engined, Westinghouse J30-powered night fighter design (similar layout to their Tigercat), leading to an initial contract being issued on 3 April 1946. The US Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) also issued a contract to Grumman for two G-75s (BuAer designation &quot;XF9F-1&quot;) experimental aircraft on 11 April 1946 in case the Skyknight encountered problems. Shortly thereafter, Grumman recognised that the G-75 would not be a successful aircraft, instead, the company had been working on a completely different single-engined day fighter, initially known as the &quot;G-79&quot;; it would later become the Grumman F9F Panther.

===Into flight===
On 23 March 1948, the &quot;XF3D-1&quot; performed its maiden flight from Douglas&#x27; El Segundo facility with test pilot Russell Thaw at the controls. While wind tunnel testing had indicated the need for aerodynamic changes, such as the addition of wing fences, flight testing provided these to be unnecessary. Flight testing continued at El Segundo up until October 1948, after which the three prototypes were transported to Muroc Air Force Base (later renamed Edwards Air Force Base) to participate in service trials. These units were powered by a pair of Westinghouse J34-WE-24 turbojets, capable of thrust, which were installed underneath the roots of then-standard straight wings of the early jet era. During June 1948, a production contract for 28 &quot;F3D-1&quot; production aircraft, powered by improved J34-WE-32 engines, was issued; relatively little external changes were made between the prototype and production aircraft, save for the enlargement of the engine nacelles. The first production aircraft made its first flight on 13 February 1950. That same month, shore-based testing was concluded.

As a night fighter that was not expected to be as fast as smaller daylight fighters, the expectation was to have a stable platform for its radar system and the four 20 mm cannon mounted in the lower fuselage. Yet, the F3D was capable of outturning a MiG-15 jet fighter. The fire control system in the F3D-1 was the Westinghouse AN/APQ-35. The AN/APQ-35 was advanced for the time, a combination of three different radars, each performing separate functions: an AN/APS-21 search radar, an AN/APG-26 tracking radar, both located in the nose, and an AN/APS-28 tail warning radar. The AN/APS-21 was capable of detecting aircraft at distances up to 20 miles away while the AN/APG-26 could achieve a weapons lock up to 2.25 miles away and the AN/APS-28 was effective up to 10 miles away. The complexity of this vacuum tube-based radar system, produced before the advent of semiconductor electronics, required intensive maintenance to keep it operating properly.

The F3D-1 was followed by the &quot;F3D-2&quot;, which was first ordered in August 1949. This model was intended to have Westinghouse J46 engines in enlarged nacelles to replace the J34-WE-32 engines of the F3D-1; however, on account of development problems with the J46, the F3D-2 was initially fitted with J34-WE-36 engines instead. Higher-thrust J34-WE-38 engines were installed later, noticeably increasing the aircraft&#x27;s performance. Additional changes on the F3D-2 included the incorporation of an improved Westinghouse AN/APQ-36 fire control system, autopilot, air conditioning, and a bulletproof windscreen. A total of 237 F3D-2s were built prior to production being terminated on 23 March 1952. At one stage, a higher performance &quot;F3D-3&quot; variant, equipped with swept wings and J46 engines, was planned, yet work was cancelled after the J46&#x27;s development was so troublesome that officials opted to terminate work.

==Operational history==
===Korean War===
The 28 F3D-1s produced were primarily used to train F3D crews; as such, this model did not see combat in the Korean War. The F3D-2 Skyknight was only operated in the Korean theatre by United States Marine Corps (USMC) land–based squadrons, beginning in August 1952. The first aircraft to arrive in Korea were initially unable to commence operations due to a lack of gun barrel extensions, which were necessary to fire the aircraft&#x27;s cannons safely; the first aircraft to be modified was on 9 August 1952, permitting live operations to commence in the following weeks. Prior to this, exercises were conducted to develop closer coordination with ground controllers, upon whom the F3D-2s were dependent during their night time operations.

From the onset of operations, hostile jamming from inside North Korea proved to be effective against onboard radar. This factor contributed to Skyknight pilots often experiencing difficulty when attempting to close in, identify, and lock onto suspected hostile aircraft. Ground-based anti-aircraft artillery, which was often equipped with radar-guided search lights, proved to be more of a threat to night time operations over Korea than the occasional MiG-15; such aircraft often acted as bait, attempting to draw the Skyknights into coordinated traps. According to Copalman, the AN/APS-28 tail warning radar unit proved quite advantageous in terms of situational awareness.

The Skyknight was responsible for downing more enemy aircraft over Korea than any other single type of naval aircraft. The first air-to-air victory was recorded on the night of 2 November 1952 by a USMC F3D-2 piloted by Major William T. Stratton Jr., and his radar operator, Master Sergeant Hans C. Hoglind of VMF(N)-513 Flying Nightmares, Major Stratton shot down what he believed was a Yakovlev Yak-15 (even though no Yak-15s were reported in Korea) which was the first successful night radar interception by a jet of another jet. The Skyknight claimed its first MiG-15 kill on 8 November 1952, when Captain O.R. Davis and Warrant Officer D.F. &quot;Ding&quot; Fessler downed a MiG-15 northwest of Pyongyang. USMC pilot Lt. Joseph Corvi and his radar operator Sergeant Dan George set another record with the Skyknight on the night of 10 December 1952, when they downed the first aircraft by an aircraft with a radar track and lock-on and without visual contact. They performed the feat by using their radar to lock onto a Polikarpov Po-2 biplane. They were also credited with another probable kill that night.

In January 1953, the number of USMC Skyknights in Korea was doubled to 24; this increase allowed them to effectively escort B-29 Superfortresses on night bombing missions. On 12 January 1953, an F3D-2 of VMF(N)-513 that was escorting B-29s on a night bombing mission was vectored to a contact and shot down the fourth aircraft by a Skyknight. By the end of the war, Skyknights had claimed six enemy aircraft (one Polikarpov Po-2, one Yakovlev Yak-15 and four MiG-15s).

In May 1953, Composite Squadron 4 Detachment 44N was deployed to Korea via the U.S.S. Lake Champlain. They sailed through the Mediterranean Sea and on to the eastern Korean coast. After arriving, VC-4 flew a few patrols from the ship, but it was soon apparent that the planes were not well suited for the ships wooden deck. The exhaust nozzles on the F3D were angled slightly down and during take-off, the jet&#x27;s exhaust scorched the teakwood deck of the ship. After each take-off the deck hands would rush out onto the deck and put out the smoldering fires. After several of these fire drills, the Ship&#x27;s Captain insisted that VC-4 be transferred to the mainland and join up with VMF(N) 513.
On 23 June 1953, VC4 (DET44N) joined with VMF(N) 513 at K-6 Airbase south of Seoul. The mission of VC-4 DET44N as directed by Commander Task Force NINETY-ONE and as employed as an integral part of Marine All Weather Fighter Squadron 513 based ashore, providing night fighter escort for U.S. Air Force medium bomber (B-50) strikes on targets in North Korea and providing night combat air patrols in the Chodo Island area, extending from the Haeju peninsula to the Yalu River.
One F3D, piloted by LTJG Bob Bick and his RO, Chief Petty Officer Linton Smith, was lost to enemy fire on 2 July 1953. This aircraft was part of the detachment from Fleet Composite Squadron FOUR (VC-4) at NAS Atlantic City.
Operational Comments June 1953 through July 1953
The following are excerpts from Carrier Air Group FOUR, Action Report of VC-4 Detachment 44N for period 19 June 1953 to 27 July 1953.

1. The radar equipment in the F3D-2 is excellent, however the relatively low speed and slow rate of climb of the aircraft prohibits exploiting the advantage of the excellent radar coverage against high speed enemy jets.

2. The extreme visibility of the glow from the engines&#x27; tailpipes offers an easy target for a pursuer and a detriment to the evasiveness of the aircraft.

3. The near vertical forward windshield and the lack of windshield wipers, limits the visibility of the pilot, on a final GCA approach in heavy rain, to the curved side panel. Under such conditions of heavy rain, forward visibility is extremely poor.
While the Skyknight lacked the swept wings and high subsonic performance of the MiG-15, its powerful fire control system enabled it to find and shoot down other fighters at night, while most MiG-15s could only be guided by ground-based radar.

===Post Korean War===

Following the Korean War, the F3D was gradually replaced by more powerful aircraft with better radar systems. Its stability and spacious fuselage made the aircraft easily adaptable to other roles. The F3D (under the designations &quot;F3D-1M&quot; and &quot;F3D-2M&quot;) was used to support development of a number of air-to-air missile systems during the 1950s, including the Sparrow I, II, and III and Meteor missiles. The Sparrow missile was developed at Pacific Missile Test Center and early test firings were conducted at Naval Ordnance Test Station China Lake. During 1954, the F3D-2M became the first Navy jet aircraft to be fitted with an operational air-to-air missile, the Sparrow I, an all weather day/night beyond-visual-range missile that used beam riding guidance for the aircrew to control the missile&#x27;s track. Only 28 aircraft (12 F3D-1Ms, and 16 F3D-2Ms) were modified to use the missiles.

In the late 1950s, a number of Marine F3D-2s were re-configured as electronic warfare aircraft and were accordingly redesignated &quot;F3D-2Q&quot; (later &quot;EF-10B&quot;). Several aircraft were also converted for use as trainers and were thus redesignated &quot;F3D-2T&quot;. Some of these aircraft were outfitted with a single 10&quot; photography camera, mounted in the tail section, for aerial reconnaissance.

During 1959, Ed Heinemann proposed that Douglas refurbish retired F3Ds for civil use, reasoning that the former military aircraft could be offered at a much lower price than newly designed business jets such as the Lockheed JetStar. Some work on the initiative was undertaken, but it was canceled after it was determined that the stored aircraft were in a generally poor condition, making their refurbishment more costly than forecast.

When the U.S. Navy issued a requirement for a fleet defense missile fighter in 1959, Douglas responded with the F6D Missileer, which was essentially an updated and enlarged F3D that would carry the AAM-N-10 Eagle long-range air-to-air missile, with its most important characteristics being its large fuel capacity, its considerable time-on-station, a crew of two and sophisticated electronics, rather than speed or maneuverability. This concept, which retained the straight wings in an age of supersonic combat aircraft, was soon cancelled as it was felt that the aircraft would not be able to effectively defend itself against more nimble fighters. The supersonic General Dynamics-Grumman F-111B was subsequently developed to carry long-range missiles, was cancelled due to excessive weight and changing tactical requirements. The Grumman F-14 Tomcat later entered service in this role.

Skyknights continued in service through the 1960s in a gull white color scheme, by which point many of their contemporaries had long since been retired. During 1962, at which point the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force unified their designation systems, the F3D-1 was redesignated &quot;F-10A&quot; while the F3D-2 was redesignated &quot;F-10B&quot;.

===Vietnam War=== 
The Skyknight was the only Korean War jet fighter that also flew in Vietnam. EF-10Bs served in the Electronic warfare role during the Vietnam War until 1969. The large interior provided ample room for electronic equipment. U.S. Marine Marine Composite Reconnaissance Squadron One (VMCJ-1) &quot;Golden Hawks&quot; began operating the EF-10B on 17 April 1965 under Lt. Col Wes Corman at Da Nang Air Base Republic of Vietnam with six aircraft. No more than 10 EF-10Bs were in Vietnam at one time. The Electronic Warfare Skyknight was a valuable Electronic countermeasure asset to jam the SA-2 surface-to-air missiles tracking and guidance systems. VMCJ-1 made history when its EF-10Bs conducted the first USMC airborne radar jamming mission on 29 April 1965 to support a USAF strike mission. On 27 July 1965, four EF-10Bs also supported a massive strike on missile sites outside Hanoi.

Many U.S. aircraft were lost to SA-2s in Vietnam. The electronic attack on the associated radar systems was known as &quot;Fogbound&quot; missions. The F3D also dropped chaff over the radar sites. The first EF-10B lost in Vietnam was to an SA-2 on 18 March 1966, while four more EF-10Bs were lost in Vietnam to accidents and unknown causes. Their mission was gradually assumed by the more capable EA-6A &quot;Electric Intruder&quot;, an Electronic Warfare/Electronic Countermeasures (EW/ECM) variant of the Grumman A-6 Intruder attack bomber. The EF-10B Skyknight continued to fly lower–threat EW missions until they were withdrawn from South Vietnam in October 1969. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s EKA-3 Skywarrior and the USAF&#x27;s Douglas RB-66 Destroyer also assumed electronic missions.

During May 1970, the U.S. Marine Corps retired the last of its EF-10Bs.

===Post Vietnam===
The U.S. Navy continued to use the F-10s for avionics systems testing. The F-10 was used as a radar testbed to develop the APQ-72 radar. The nose of an F-4 Phantom was added to the front of an F-10B. Another F-10 had a modified radome installed by the radar manufacturer Westinghouse. Yet another TF-10B was modified with the nose from an A-4 Skyhawk. In 1968, three Skyknights were transferred to the U.S. Army. These aircraft were operated by the Raytheon Corporation at Holloman AFB where they were used testing at the White Sands Missile Range into the 1980s; they were the last flyable Skyknights.

<text>The Béjart Ballet Lausanne is a Swiss ballet company. It is based in the city of Lausanne and performs all over the world.

The Béjart Ballet Lausanne was founded in 1987. It was established by Maurice Béjart, a well-known choreographer who had previously founded and managed the Ballet of the 20th Century in Brussels, Belgium. Since the disappearance of the founder in 2007, Gil Roman, dancer and choreographer was the artistic director till November 2021.

Maurice Béjart always wanted to open the world of the ballet to a larger audience. Animated by the same spirit, Gil Roman and his dancers perform all over the world. Béjart Ballet Lausanne is one of the very few companies able to fill vast spaces such as the NHK Hall of Tokyo, the Kremlin State Palace of Moscow, Odeon of Herodes Atticus in Athens, the Palais des congrès de Paris, Forest National in Brussels or the Patinoire of Malley-Lausanne.

Since 2007 till 2021, with his search and work for contemporary creation Gil Roman to maintains and develops the repertoire of the Béjart Ballet Lausanne. The work of Maurice Béjart is at the heart of this repertoire, with emblematic choreographies, as &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, &quot;Boléro, The Ninth Symphony&quot; or &quot;Ballet for Life&quot; but Gil Roman also wants to present the variety of this repertoire, with &quot;Piaf&quot; or &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; for example. Choreographer for 20 years, the artistic director also nourished the repertoire with his own creations. Choreographers like Alonzo King, Tony Fabre, Christophe Garcia, Giorgio Madia, Yuka Oishi or Julio Arozarena also contributed to the creative development of the Béjart Ballet Lausanne.

The Company remains faithful to its vocation: preserving Maurice Béjart’s work, while remaining a space of creation.

<text>The MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist has been given out since the first annual MTV Video Music Awards in 1984. Until 2006, the award was named Best New Artist in a Video. In 2007 its name was changed to Best New Artist, as the category underwent a format change to recognize the artist&#x27;s body of work for the full year rather than a specific video. For the 2008 ceremony, the award retained its 2007 name but returned to the format of awarding a specific video rather than the artist&#x27;s full body of work.

The category was later renamed Artist to Watch through 2013 to 2015 while still keeping the format of an award going to a particular video. In 2020, the Best New Artist award merged with the Push Artist of the Year award (2018-2019) to create the Push Best New Artist award. In 2021, MTV returned the category to its original name (Best New Artist), thus separating it from the MTV Push initiative, which again received its own category (Push Performance of the Year).

<text>Salmon Bay () is a portion of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, which passes through the city of Seattle, linking Lake Washington to Puget Sound, lying west of the Fremont Cut. It is the westernmost section of the canal and empties into Puget Sound&#x27;s Shilshole Bay. Because of the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, the smaller, western half of the bay is salt water, and the eastern half is fresh water (though not without saline contamination: see Lake Union).

== History ==
Before the construction of the Ship Canal, Salmon Bay was entirely salt water and subject to the tides. The bay was the permanent home of the Shilshole people, a Lushootseed-speaking people closely related to the Duwamish. The Lushootseed name of the bay is , which is the origin of the name of the Shilshole people (). Along the north side of the bay was a village (also called ) of the Shilshole, which by the late 19th century, had two longhouses (each 60&#x27;x120&#x27;) and a larger potlatch house. At this time, the headman of the village was Shilshole Curly. Although much of the population left the village, a community still remained living in the village until the early 1900s. The village was destroyed in the 1910s and the residents removed. Some assimilated into the local community while others moved to local reservations. The last remaining resident of the village was Salmon Bay Charlie until he was evicted and removed to the Port Madison Reservation.

Beginning in 1916, the level of the bay was raised by as the Ballard Locks formed a dam. East of the locks, Salmon Bay is spanned by the Ballard Bridge, a bascule bridge that carries 15th Avenue traffic between Ballard and Interbay; its predecessor was built across the bay in 1891. West of the locks, it is spanned by the Salmon Bay Bridge that carries the BNSF Railway railroad tracks between Ballard and Magnolia.

In the 1920s, an archaeological dig of the western parts of the site of the former Shilshole village was conducted by A. G. Colley. Archaeologists found many tools, including those made of iron, as a result of the dig.

<text>The [[MTV Video Music Award]] for Best Direction is an award given to the artist, the artist&#x27;s manager, and the director of the music video. From 1984 to 2006, the full name of the award was Best Direction in a Video, and in 2007, it was briefly renamed Best Director. The category acquired its current name with the 2008 awards. 

American artist Taylor Swift is the biggest winner in this category with four wins from six nominations.

The most nominated director is David Fincher with eight nominations. Remarkably, seven of Fincher&#x27;s nominations were achieved in a three-year span (1989–1991), as he was nominated a record three times in both 1989 and 1990. Fincher&#x27;s recent nomination (and win) occurred over twenty years later in 2013 for his work on Justin Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;Suit &amp; Tie.&quot; Closely following him are Dave Meyers with seven nominations and Francis Lawrence with six. Hype Williams is the director with the most nominations and no wins at five.

The performers whose videos have won the most awards are Madonna and Taylor Swift, whose videos have garnered three direction moonmen respectively. However, Eminem&#x27;s videos have received the most nominations with seven. Swift is also the only performer to have won four moonmen in this category for her work directing.

Five other performers have won a moonman in this category for their work directing/co-directing their videos: George Michael, Beck, Erykah Badu, Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys, Kendrick Lamar and Lil Nas X.

<doc id="477225" wikidata="Q77562" url="?curid=477225" title="Johann Albrecht Bengel">
<text>Johann Albrecht Bengel (24 June 1687 – 2 November 1752), also known as &quot;Bengelius&quot;, was a Lutheran pietist clergyman and Greek-language scholar known for his edition of the Greek New Testament and his commentaries on it.

==Life and career==
Bengel was born at Winnenden in Württemberg. Due to the death of his father in 1693, he was educated by a family friend, David Wendel Spindler, who became a master in the gymnasium at Stuttgart. In 1703 Bengel left Stuttgart and entered the University of Tübingen as a student at the &quot;Tübinger Stift&quot;, where, in his spare time, he devoted himself especially to the works of Aristotle and Spinoza, and, in theology, to those of Philipp Spener, Johann Arndt and August Francke. His knowledge of the metaphysics of Spinoza was such that he was selected by one of the professors to prepare materials for a treatise, &quot;De Spinosismo&quot;, which was afterwards published.

After acquiring his degree, Bengel devoted himself to theology. Even at this time he had religious doubts; it is interesting in view of his later work that one cause of his perplexities was the difficulty of ascertaining the true reading of certain passages in the Greek New Testament. Bengel entered the ministry in 1707 and was appointed to the parochial charge of Metzingen-unter-Urach. In the following year he was recalled to Tübingen to undertake the office of (theological tutor).

He remained at Tübingen until 1713, when he was appointed head of a seminary recently established at Denkendorf as a preparatory school of theology. Before entering into his new duties he travelled through the greater part of Germany, studying the systems of education which were in use, and visiting the seminaries of the Jesuits as well as those of the Lutheran and Reformed churches. Among other places he went to Heidelberg and Halle, and had his attention directed at Heidelberg to the canons of scripture criticism published by Gerhard von Maastricht, and at Halle to Campeius Vitringa&#x27;s &quot;Anacrisis ad Apocalypsin&quot;. The influence exerted by these upon his theological studies is manifest in some of his works.

For 28 years, from 1713 to 1741, he was master () of the &quot;Klosterschule&quot; at Denkendorf, a seminary for candidates for the ministry established in a former monastery of the Canons of the Holy Sepulchre. To these years, the period of his greatest intellectual activity, belong many of his chief works.

In 1741 he was appointed prelate (i.e. general superintendent) at Herbrechtingen, where he remained until 1749, when he was raised to the dignity of consistorial counsellor and prelate of Alpirsbach, with a residence in Stuttgart. He devoted himself to the discharge of his duties as a member of the consistory. A question of considerable difficulty was at that time occupying the attention of the church courts: the manner in which those who separated themselves from the church were to be dealt with, and the amount of toleration which should be accorded to meetings held in private houses for the purpose of religious edification. The civil power (the Duke of Württemberg was a Roman Catholic) was disposed to have recourse to measures of repression, while the members of the consistory, recognizing the good effects of such meetings, were inclined to concede considerable liberty. Bengel exerted himself on the side of the members of the consistory. In 1751 the University of Tübingen conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Divinity. He died in Stuttgart, aged 65.

Bengel carried on an 18-year-long controversy with Nicolaus Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf, leader of the Moravian Brethren from Herrnhut in Saxony. This led to a break between the Moravian Brethren and the dour Pietism typical of Württemberg, represented by Bengel. With his determined certainty giving him systematic insight into the divine Plan of Salvation, Bengel dogmatically opposed the dynamic, ecumenical, missionary efforts of Zinzendorf, who was indifferent to all dogmatism and intolerance. As Bengel did not hesitate to manipulate historical calendars in his chiliastic attempts to predict the end of the world, Zinzendorf rejected this as superstitious &quot;interpretation of signs.&quot;

His reputation as a Biblical scholar and critic rests chiefly on his edition of the Greek New Testament (1734) and his exegetical annotations on the same, which have passed through many editions in Latin, German, and English and are still highly valued by expositors of the New Testament.

==Greek New Testament==

Bengel&#x27;s edition of the Greek New Testament was published at Tübingen in 1734, and at Stuttgart in the same year, but without the critical apparatus. As early as 1725, in an addition to his edition of &quot;Chrysostoms De Sacerdotio&quot;, he had given an account in his &quot;Prodromus Novi Testamenti Graeci recte cauteque adornandi&quot; of the principles on which his intended edition was to be based. In preparation for his work, Bengel was able to avail himself of the collations of upwards of twenty manuscripts, none of them, however, of great importance, twelve of which had been collated by himself. In constituting the text, he imposed upon himself the singular restriction of not inserting any variant reading which had not already been printed in some preceding edition of the Greek text. From this rule, however, he deviated in the case of the Apocalypse, where, owing to the corrupt state of the text, he felt himself at liberty to introduce certain readings on manuscript authority. In the lower margin of the page he inserted a selection of various readings, the relative importance of which he denoted by the first five letters of the Greek alphabet in the following manner: α was employed to denote the reading which in his judgment was the true one, although he did not venture to place it in the text; β, a reading better than that in the text; γ, one equal to the textual reading; and δ, readings inferior to those in the text. Robert Estienne&#x27;s division into verses was retained in the inner margin, but the text was divided into paragraphs.

The text was followed by a critical apparatus, the first part of which consisted of an introduction to the criticism of the New Testament, in the thirty-fourth section of which he laid down and explained his celebrated canon, &quot;Proclivi scriptioni praestat ardua&quot; (The difficult reading is to be preferred to that which is easy), the soundness of which, as a general principle, has been recognized by succeeding critics. The second part of the critical apparatus was devoted to a consideration of the various readings, and here Bengel adopted the plan of stating the evidence both against and in favor of a particular reading, thus placing before the reader the materials for forming a judgment. Bengel was the first definitely to propound the theory of families or recensions of manuscripts.

His investigations had led him to see that a certain affinity or resemblance existed amongst many of the authorities for the Greek text manuscripts, versions, and ecclesiastical writers: for example, if a peculiar reading was found in one of these, it was generally also found in the other members of the same class; and this general relationship seemed to point ultimately to a common origin for all the authorities which presented such peculiarities. Although disposed at first to divide the various documents into three classes, he finally adopted a classification into two: the African or older family of documents, and the Asiatic, or more recent class, to which he attached only a subordinate value. The theory was afterwards adopted by J.S. Semler and J.J. Griesbach, and worked up into an elaborate system by the latter critic.

Bengel&#x27;s labors on the text of the Greek Testament were received with great disfavour in many quarters. Like Brian Walton and John Mill before him, he had to encounter the opposition of those who believed that the certainty of the word of God was endangered by the importance attached to the various readings. JJ Wetstein, on the other hand, accused him of excessive caution in not making freer use of his critical materials. In answer to these strictures, Bengel published a &quot;Defence of the Greek Text of His New Testament&quot;, which he prefixed to his &quot;Harmony of the Four Gospels&quot;, published in 1736, and which contained an answer to the complaints, especially of Wetstein, which had been made against him.

The text of Bengel long enjoyed a high reputation among scholars, and was frequently reprinted. An enlarged edition of the critical apparatus was published by Philip David Burk in 1763.

==&quot;Gnomon Novi Testamenti&quot;==
The other great work of Bengel, and that on which his reputation as an exegete is mainly based, is his &quot;Gnomon Novi Testamenti&quot;, or &quot;Exegetical Annotations on the New Testament&quot;, published in 1742. It was the fruit of twenty years labor, and exhibits with a brevity of expression, which, it has been said, condenses more matter into a line than can be extracted from pages of other writers, the results of his study. He modestly entitled his work a &quot;Gnomon&quot; or index, his object being rather to guide the reader to ascertain the meaning for himself, than to save him from the trouble of personal investigation. The principles of interpretation on which he proceeded were, to import nothing into Scripture, but to draw out of it everything that it really contained, in conformity with grammatico-historical rules not to be hampered by dogmatical considerations; and not to be influenced by the symbolical books. Bengel&#x27;s hope that the &quot;Gnomon&quot; would help to rekindle a fresh interest in the study of the New Testament was fully realized. It has passed through many editions, has been translated into German and into English (by Charlton T. Lewis and Marvin Vincent in 1860), and is still valued by expositors of the New Testament. Methodist founder John Wesley made great use of it in compiling his &quot;Explanatory Notes upon the New Testament&quot; (1755), despite an initial inclination towards &quot;consulting none but the inspired writers&quot;.

Besides the two works already described, Bengel was the editor or author of many others, classical, patristic, ecclesiastical and expository. The more important are: &quot;Ordo Temporum&quot;, a treatise on the chronology of Scripture, in which he enters upon speculations regarding the end of the world, and an &quot;Exposition of the Apocalypse&quot; which enjoyed for a time great popularity in Germany, and was translated into several languages. His fame was such that almost 200 years later, Hermann Hesse has the hero of The Glass Bead Game discuss Bengel&#x27;s writings.

== Chiliastic views ==
Bengel’s meticulous study of the Bible led him to believe that dates and time periods were related, all the way through from Genesis to Revelation, bringing him to the conclusion that June 18, 1836 would witness the start of the Millennium, to include the fall of the Antichrist, which he believed to be the Roman Catholic Church, the conversion of the Jews, the reign of Christ for 1000 years as promised in Revelation 20, and the final judgement.

Bengel’s calculations regarding a date for the return of Christ and the end-times influenced not only his contemporary, John Wesley, but also Johann Heinrich Jung-Stilling, whose inclusion of Bengel’s date into his famous novel, &quot;Das Heimweh&quot; (Homesickness or Nostalgia) inspired many German Pietists at the time to emigrate towards the east, where they sought safety until Christ’s return. The great German theologian, inventor and astronomer, Philipp Matthäus Hahn (1739 - 1790), constructed an astronomical clock inspired by Bengel’s eschatological calculations, and his granddaughter, Pauline Beate, was to marry Christoph Hoffmann, the founder of the Adventist group, the German Templers.

Bengel’s date for the Second Coming and the final judgement were largely unknown by the English speaking Adventists during the early 19th century, partly due to the fact that he wrote in Latin, which was translated into German, and partly overshadowed by the popular writings of William Miller and his projected date of 1844.

<text>The [[MTV Video Music Award]] for Best Choreography is a craft award given to the artist, the artist&#x27;s manager, and choreographer of the music video. From 1984 to 2007, the full name of the award was Best Choreography in a Video. The biggest winner is Frank Gatson with six wins. Michael Rooney follows closely behind with five wins.

Frank Gatson is also the most nominated choreographer with eleven nominations. He is followed by Tina Landon with nine nominations (and yet only one win). The performers whose videos have won the most awards are Janet Jackson and Beyoncé, garnering a total of four Moonmen for choreography. Madonna&#x27;s videos have received the most nominations with twelve.

Seven performers have won a Moonman in this category for their work choreographing or co-choreographing their own videos: Michael Jackson (&quot;Thriller&quot;), Prince (&quot;Raspberry Beret&quot;), Paula Abdul (&quot;Straight Up&quot;), Janet Jackson (&quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;), Madonna (&quot;Ray of Light&quot;), Shakira (&quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;), Bruno Mars (&quot;Treasure&quot;), and OK Go (&quot;I Won&#x27;t Let You Down&quot;). An additional ten other performers/groups have been nominated for their work choreographing their own videos: Toni Basil, Morris Day, Bobby Brown, MC Hammer, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, Quad City DJ&#x27;s, Jason Kay, Janelle Monáe, Beyoncé and Solange. Abdul, a professional choreographer before launching her musical career, was nominated twice for choreographing two Janet Jackson videos, and won for &quot;Nasty&quot; before winning again for her own video for &quot;Straight Up&quot;. Basil, who is also a professional choreographer, is the only other artist to have been nominated for work on both their own videos and other artists.

Actor Christopher Walken won this award in 2001 for helping choreograph the video for Fatboy Slim&#x27;s &quot;Weapon of Choice,&quot; in which he appears dancing. Similarly, Spike Jonze (as Richard Koufey) won this award in 1999 for his own dancing in Fatboy Slim&#x27;s video &quot;Praise You&quot;.

<doc id="477229" wikidata="Q431918" url="?curid=477229" title="Grumman E-1 Tracer">
<text>The Grumman E-1 Tracer (WF prior to 1962) was the first purpose-built airborne early warning aircraft used by the United States Navy. It was a derivative of the Grumman C-1 Trader and entered service in 1960. It was replaced by the more modern Grumman E-2 Hawkeye by the mid-1960s-1970s.

==Design and development==
Following World War II, modified attack aircraft, including the AD-3W Skyraider and TBM-3W Avengers, filled the airborne early warning role. In 1951, the US Navy, seeking a replacement for the TBM-3W, asked Grumman and Vought for new AEW aircraft based on their competing designs for a carrier-based anti-submarine aircraft, the Grumman XS2F Tracker and the Vought XS2U. Grumman&#x27;s design, Design 95, which was designated XWF-1 under the 1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system, used the same fuselage and wings as the XS2F, with an AN/APS-20 radar mounted on a pylon over the forward fuselage. The arrangement was chosen to not require changes to the Tracker&#x27;s wing folding design. Two prototypes were ordered, but the project was cancelled late in 1952.

In 1955, engineers at Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation began studies on how to accommodate a new radar being developed by Hazeltine (which became the AN/APS-82) aboard a carried-based aircraft, and concluded that a design based on the Tracker would be the best option. When, later that year, the US Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) developed requirements for a new AEW aircraft, Grumman proposed a development of the Tracker, and began detailed work on the project.

The E-1 was designated WF under the 1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system; the designation earned it the nickname &quot;Willy Fudd&quot;. The Tracer was derived from the C-1 Trader, itself a derivative of the S-2 Tracker carrier-based antisubmarine aircraft, known as S2F under the old system, nicknamed &quot;Stoof&quot;, leading to the WF/E-1, with its distinctive radome, being known as &quot;Stoof with a Roof.&quot; The E-1 featured folding wings of a very particular design for compact storage aboard aircraft carriers; unlike the S-2 and C-1 in which the wings folded upwards, the radome atop the fuselage required the E-1&#x27;s designers to re-adopt an updated version of the Grumman-patented &quot;Sto-Wing&quot; folding wing system, pioneered on their earlier Grumman F4F-4 Wildcat piston-engined fighter of the early-WWII period, to fold its wings aftwards along the sides of the fuselage.

Its prototype made its first flight on December 17, 1956. Just over fourteen months later the first WF-2 (E-1B) Tracer made its maiden flight.

With carrier operations being a necessity for the aircraft, various features are geared towards providing stability and control when launching from and landing on an aircraft carrier. The distinct twin-tail found on the E-1 allows for greater rudder control and stability on the yaw axis without the implementation of one large unwieldy space-taking vertical stabilizer. It also provides a degree of redundancy, allowing a pilot to maintain some yaw control if one rudder is damaged. The positioning of the rudders also place them on the edges of the prop wash generated by the spinning propellers of the aircraft, creating additional stability as the fast wind flowing over the stabilizers creates a stronger rectifying force for any sideslip or rudder input than if the vertical stabilizers were placed out of the prop-wash zone. While this placement would lead to a yawing moment on most smaller aircraft, as the helical motion of the prop wash would collide with only one side of the vertical stabilizer, the dual propellers on the E-1 create opposing yawing torques on the aircraft of the same magnitude, leading to approximately net zero yaw as a result of prop wash.

The E-1, despite having a set of landing gear mounted under its nose, is a tail-dragger aircraft. This configuration provides the airframe with a distinct &quot;nose-up&quot; appearance when taxiing, and allows for the wings to generate more lift on launch from a catapult than if the aircraft was level due to the higher angle-of-attack (AoA) of the aircraft.

===Radar===
The Tracer was fitted with the Hazeltine AN/APS-82 in its radome and fuselage, a substantial upgrade to its predecessor the AN/APS-20. The AN/APS-82 featured an airborne moving target indicator (AMTI), which compares the video of one pulse time to the next in reflected radar energy to distinguish a flying aircraft from the clutter produced by wave action at the ocean&#x27;s surface. The energy reflected from an aircraft changes position rapidly compared to the energy reflected from the surrounding sea. 

The radar was also capable of ground stabilization and target height determination.

A airfoil-shaped dome protects the parabolic dish antennae, mounted above the fuselage.

==Operational history==

As one of the first carrier based early warning aircraft, the E-1 Tracer served from 1960 to 1977, although considered only an interim type, being replaced by the Grumman E-2 Hawkeye in the mid-1960s. First deployed with VAW-11 on board USS Constellation (CV-64). During the early years of the Vietnam War, E-1s saw extensive service, providing combat air patrol (CAP) fighters with target vectors, and controlling Alpha strikes over North Vietnam. With a radius of 250–300 miles, the E-1B served as an early warning to strike aircraft of enemy MiG activity. Tracer-equipped VAW squadrons logged 56 deployments in support of operations over Southeast Asia.

By May 1973, most E-1Bs were retired, with only four VAW-121 Tracers based at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, still in service. These aircraft were soon retired during mid-summer 1977 following a final cruise on board and were ferried to the Davis-Monthan storage facility. The E-1B Tracer was struck from the inventory by 1977.

==Variants==
; XWF-1: Proposed AEW derivative of the S2F-1 equipped with the AN/APS-20; not built.
; G-117: Company designation for WF-2. One TF-1 (BuNo 136792) converted into aerodynamic prototype for WF-2 without electronics, later rebuilt as a standard C-1A, retaining the twin tail.
; WF-2: Production Airborne Early Warning version of the TF-1 Trader, redesignated E-1B in 1962, 88 built.
; E-1B: WF-2 redesignated in 1962.

==Aircraft on display==
There are five E-1 Tracers preserved at museums throughout the United States:
*E-1B, BuNo 147212: Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum, New York City
*E-1B, BuNo 147217: New England Air Museum, Windsor Locks, Connecticut
*E-1B, BuNo 147225: On board the , Patriots Point, Mount Pleasant, South Carolina
*E-1B, BuNo 147227: Pima Air &amp; Space Museum, adjacent to Davis-Monthan AFB in Tucson, Arizona
*E-1B, BuNo 148146: National Naval Aviation Museum, Naval Air Station Pensacola

Another 11 E-1 Tracers are in storage at United Aeronautical, an aircraft surplus yard located just outside Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona. At least one of those aircraft (E-1B, BuNo 148922) was sold to a private collector in 2011 with the intent to restore to fly, although no updates on the project have been posted since 2012.

<text>The MTV Video Music Award for Viewer&#x27;s Choice was first awarded at the first annual MTV Video Music Awards in 1984. Until 1994, the Viewer&#x27;s Choice award nominees were the same as the Video of the Year nominees. In 1995 MTV created a separate set of nominees for Viewer&#x27;s Choice and Video of the Year (although, TLC&#x27;s &quot;Waterfalls&quot; won both that year). This continued for the rest of the award&#x27;s history.

As the name indicated, the winner was decided by audience members, who could vote up until the very night of the show via phone calls and, later on, internet votes and text messages. This award was last given out at the 2006 ceremony, in which all general categories became fan-voted, seemingly rendering the award redundant. The following year, MTV revamped the VMAs and eliminated the Viewer&#x27;s Choice award, permanently transferring its voting procedures over to the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] award.

Aerosmith is the biggest winner of this award, having won it three times. Also, only four acts—INXS, Aerosmith, TLC, and Green Day—have won both the Video of the Year and Viewer&#x27;s Choice awards on the same year (though Green Day won each award with a different video in 2005).

<text>The burning bush (or the unburnt bush) refers to an event recorded in the Jewish Torah (as also in the biblical Old Testament and Islamic scripture). It is described in the third chapter of the Book of Exodus as having occurred on Mount Horeb. According to the biblical account, the bush was on fire but was not consumed by the flames, hence the name. In the biblical and Quranic narrative, the burning bush is the location at which Moses was appointed by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and into Canaan.

The Hebrew word in the narrative that is translated into English as &quot;bush&quot; is &quot;seneh&quot; (), which refers in particular to brambles; &quot;seneh&quot; is a &quot;dis legomenon&quot;, only appearing in two places, both of which describe the burning bush. The use of &quot;seneh&quot; may be a deliberate pun on &quot;Sinai&quot; (), a feature common in Hebrew texts.

==Biblical narrative==
In the narrative, an angel of the Lord is described as appearing in a bush and God is subsequently described as calling out from it to Moses, who had been grazing Jethro&#x27;s flocks there. When Moses starts to approach, God tells Moses to take off his sandals first due to the place being a sacred space.

The voice from the bush, which later self-discloses as Yahweh, reveals himself as &quot;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&quot; and thus Moses hides his face.

Some Old Testament scholars regard the account of the burning bush as being spliced together from the Yahwist and Elohist texts, with the angel of Yahweh and the removal of sandals being part of the Yahwist version, and the Elohist&#x27;s parallels to these being God and the turning away of Moses&#x27;s face, respectively.

The text portrays Yahweh as telling Moses that he is sending him to Pharaoh to bring the Israelites out of Egypt, an action that Yahweh decided upon as a result of noticing that the Israelites were being oppressed by the Egyptians. Yahweh tells Moses to tell the elders of the Israelites that Yahweh would lead them into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, a region generally referred to as a whole by the term &quot;Canaan&quot;; this is described as being a land of &quot;milk and honey&quot;.

Moses asks &quot;When I come to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His name?’ what shall I say to them?” (Ex 3:13) The voice of God from the bush reveals that he is Yahweh. The text derives &quot;Yahweh&quot; () from the Hebrew word () in the phrase &quot;I Am Who I Am&quot;.

According to the narrative, Yahweh instructs Moses to confront the Egyptians and Israelites and briefs the prophet on what is to take place. Yahweh then performs various demonstrative miracles in order to bolster Moses&#x27;s credibility. Among other things, his staff was transmuted into a snake, Moses&#x27;s hand was temporarily afflicted with &quot;snowy tzaraath&quot;, and water was transmuted into blood. In the text, Yahweh instructs Moses to take a staff in his hands to perform miracles with it, as if it is a staff given to him rather than his own; some textual scholars propose that this latter instruction is the Elohist&#x27;s version of the more detailed earlier description, where Moses uses his staff, which they attribute to the Yahwist.

Despite the signs, Moses is described as being very reluctant to take on the role, arguing that he lacked eloquence and that someone else should be sent instead; in the text, Yahweh reacts by angrily rebuking Moses for presuming to lecture the one who made the mouth on who was qualified to speak and not to speak. Yet Yahweh concedes and allows Aaron to be sent to assist Moses since Aaron is eloquent and already on his way to meet Moses. This is the first time in the Torah that Aaron is mentioned and he is described as being Moses&#x27;s mouthpiece.

==Alternative theories==
Alexander and Zhenia Fleisher relate the biblical story of the burning bush to the plant &quot;Dictamnus&quot;. They write:
They conclude, however, that &quot;Dictamnus&quot; spp. are not found in the Sinai peninsula, adding: &quot;It is, therefore, highly improbable that any &quot;Dictamnus&quot; spp. was a true &#x27;Burning Bush&#x27;, despite such an attractive rational foundation.&quot;

Colin Humphreys replies that &quot;the book of Exodus suggests a long-lasting fire that Moses went to investigate, not a fire that flares up and then rapidly goes out.&quot;

Another theory is that it is sunlight on Har Karkom reflected in a surprising way to appear like fire.

==Location==
Christian hermits originally gathered at Mount Serbal, believing it to be the biblical Mount Sinai. However, in the 4th century, under the Byzantine Empire, the monastery built there was abandoned in favour of the newer belief that Mount Saint Catherine was the Biblical Mount Sinai; a new monastery – Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery – was built at its foot, and the alleged site of the biblical burning bush was identified. The bush growing at the spot (a bramble, scientific name &quot;Rubus sanctus&quot;), was later transplanted several yards away to a courtyard of the monastery, and its original spot was covered by a chapel dedicated to the Annunciation, with a silver star marking where the roots of the bush had come out of the ground. The Monks at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery, following church tradition, believe that this bush is, in fact, the original bush seen by Moses, rather than a later replacement, and anyone entering the chapel is required to remove their shoes, just as Moses was said to have done so in the biblical account.

However, in modern times, it is not Mount Saint Catherine, but the adjacent Jebel Musa (&quot;Mount Moses&quot;), which is currently identified as Mount Sinai by popular tradition and guidebooks; this identification arose from Bedouin tradition.

Mount Serbal, Mount Sinai, and Mount Saint Catherine all lie at the southern tip of the Sinai peninsula, but the peninsula&#x27;s name is a comparatively modern invention. It was not known by that name at the time of Josephus or earlier. Some modern scholars and theologians, favor locations in the Hijaz (at the north west of Saudi Arabia), northern Arabah (in the vicinity of Petra, or the surrounding area), or occasionally in the central or northern Sinai Peninsula. Hence, the majority of academics and theologians agree that if the Burning Bush ever existed, then it is highly unlikely to be the bush preserved at St Catherine&#x27;s Monastery.

==Symbolism and interpretations==

===Judaism===

The logo of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America is also an image of the burning bush with the phrase &quot;and the bush was not consumed&quot; in both English and Hebrew.

The &quot;Zohar&quot;, a late 1200s work of Kabbalah, suggests the burning bush was a hint that even though the Israelites were suffering in Egypt, they had God&#x27;s protection, like the bush that was burning but not consumed.

===Christianity===
====Catholic church==== 
In the medieval Catholic church the event was seen as a typological parallel for the Virgin Birth of Jesus from Mary, who conceived as a virgin, as the bush was burnt but not destroyed. Depictions in medieval Catholic art, such as the 15th-century Burning Bush Triptych altarpiece, therefore typically show a Virgin and Child in the middle of the bush or tree. The inscription on the base of the frame which translates (from Latin) as &quot;In the bush which Moses saw burning without being consumed, we recognised, Holy Mother of God, your virginity wondrously preserved&quot;. The Eastern Orthodox view was similar.

====Eastern Orthodoxy====

In Eastern Orthodoxy a tradition exists, originating in the early Christian Church Fathers and its Ecumenical Synods (or Councils), that the flame Moses saw was in fact God&#x27;s &quot;Uncreated Energies&quot;/&quot;Glory&quot;, manifested as light, thus explaining why the bush was not consumed. It is viewed as Moses being permitted to see these &quot;Uncreated Energies&quot;/&quot;Glory&quot;, which are considered to be eternal things; the Orthodox definition of salvation is this vision of the &quot;Uncreated Energies&quot;/&quot;Glory&quot;, and it is a recurring theme in the works of Greek Orthodox theologians such as John S. Romanides.

In Eastern Orthodox parlance, the preferred name for the event is &quot;The Unburnt Bush&quot;, and the theology and hymnography of the church view it as prefiguring the virgin birth of Jesus; Eastern Orthodox theology refers to Mary, the mother of Jesus as the &quot;Theotokos&quot; (&quot;God bearer&quot;), viewing her as having given birth to Incarnate God without suffering any harm, or loss of virginity, in parallel to the bush being burnt without being consumed. There is an icon-type by the name of &quot;the Unburnt Bush&quot;, which portrays Mary in the guise of &quot;God bearer&quot;; the icon&#x27;s feast day is held on 4 September ().

While God speaks to Moses, in the narrative, Eastern Orthodoxy believes that the angel was also heard by Moses; Eastern orthodoxy interprets the angel as being the Logos of God, regarding it as the &quot;Angel of Great Counsel&quot; mentioned in the Septuagint version of Isaiah 9:6; (it is &quot;Counsellor, Mighty God&quot; in the Masoretic Text).

====Reformed tradition====
The burning bush has been a popular symbol among Reformed churches since it was first adopted by the Huguenots (French Calvinists) in 1583 during its 12th National Synod. The French motto &quot;Flagror non consumor&quot; – &quot;I am burned but not consumed&quot; – suggests the symbolism was understood of the suffering church that nevertheless lives. However, given the fire is a sign of God&#x27;s presence, he who is a consuming fire (Hebrews 12:29) the miracle appears to point to a greater miracle: God, in grace, is with his covenant people and so they are not consumed.

* The current symbol of the Reformed Church of France is a burning bush with the Huguenot cross.
* The motto of the Church of Scotland is &quot;Nec tamen consumebatur&quot;, Latin for &quot;Yet it was not consumed&quot;, an allusion to the biblical description of the burning bush, and a stylised depiction of the burning bush is used as the Church&#x27;s symbol. Usage dates from the 1690s.
* The burning bush is also used as the basis of the symbol of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, which uses the Latin motto &quot;Ardens sed virens&quot;, meaning &quot;Burning but flourishing&quot;, and is based on the biblical description of the burning bush. The same logo is used from the separated Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster.
* The burning bush is also the symbol of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, Presbyterian Church in Australia crest, Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia with the motto in English since its foundation in 1846: &#x27;And the Bush was not consumed&#x27;, Presbyterian Church in New Zealand, Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, Presbyterian Church in Singapore, Presbyterian Church of Brazil, the Presbyterian Church in Malaysia, the Free Reformed Churches of North America, and the Christian Reformed Churches in the Netherlands.

===Islam===
According to the Qur’án, Moses (&quot;Musa&quot;) departed for Egypt along with his family after completing the time period. The Qur’án states that during their travel, as they stopped near the Tur, Musa observed a fire and instructed the family to wait until he returned with fire for them. When Musa reached the Valley of Tuwa, God called out to him from the right side of the valley from a tree, on what is revered as Al-Buq‘ah Al-Mubārakah (Arabic: الـبُـقـعَـة الـمُـبَـارَكَـة, &quot;The Blessed Ground&quot;) in the Qur’án. Musa was commanded by God to remove his shoes and was informed of his selection as a prophet, his obligation of prayer and the Day of Judgment. Musa was then ordered to throw his rod which turned into a snake and later instructed to hold it. The Qur’án then narrates Musa being ordered to insert his hand into his clothes and upon revealing it would shine a bright light. God states that these are signs for the Pharaoh, and orders Musa to invite Pharaoh to the worship of one God.

===Baháʼí Faith===
The Baháʼí Faith understands the Burning Bush to represent the Voice of God. The term Burning Bush appears frequently in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, the Prophet-Founder of the faith. In the teachings of the Baháʼí Faith, the Voice of God as spoken from the Burning Bush, is now, through the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, speaking directly to humanity; “a Revelation,” Bahá’u’lláh proclaims, &quot;the potency of which hath caused every tree to cry out what the Burning Bush had aforetime proclaimed unto Moses.”
In recounting the association between Moses and the Burning Bush, Bahá’u’lláh writes,Call thou to mind the days when He Who conversed with God tended, in the wilderness, the sheep of Jethro, His father-in-law. He hearkened unto the Voice of the Lord of mankind coming from the Burning Bush which had been raised above the Holy Land, exclaiming, “O Moses! Verily I am God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.” He was so carried away by the captivating accent of the Voice that He detached Himself from the world and set out in the direction of Pharaoh and his people, invested with the power of thy Lord Who exerciseth sovereignty over all that hath been and shall be. The people of the world are now hearing that which Moses did hear, but they understand not.

-from &quot;Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh&quot;

===Rastafari===
Some Rastafari believe that the burning bush was cannabis.

<text>Wax Poetic is a New York-based trip hop band. The band came together in 1997 founded by Turkish musician Ilhan Erşahin, who is still a current member, playing tenor saxophone and keys. The group originated at the now defunct club Save the Robots, and consisted of a group of musicians jamming together. The band&#x27;s music is noted for its &quot;heavy groove of drum and bass, blended with quick dance elements.&quot; The band signed to Atlantic Records in the late &#x27;90s and released their debut self-titled album in June 2000.

Pop singer and pianist Norah Jones was a member before her break-out album &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;. Other former members include Lisa Rudolph who co-wrote four songs with Ilhan Ersahin on the first album titled three, N&#x27;Dea Davenport and Saul Williams. Jones can still be heard singing with them on two tracks of their 2003 release, &quot;Nublu Sessions&quot;.

&quot;Copenhagen&quot; was released on November 7, 2006. Part of a three part series, this CD is followed up with &quot;Istanbul&quot; and &quot;Brasil&quot;. The band&#x27;s latest album, &quot;On a Ride&quot;, was released in 2012.

Besides Ilhan Erşahin, the current members include Sissy Clemens (vocals), Gabriel Gordon (vocals), Kenny Wollesen (drums), Tina Kristina (bass) and Zeke Zima (guitar).

Ilhan, Thor, and Jochen combined with Erik Truffaz and Matt Penman to create the band Our Theory.

<doc id="477245" wikidata="Q3376896" url="?curid=477245" title="Peter Stoffer">
<text>Peter Arend Stoffer (born January 6, 1956) is a Canadian politician, who represented the riding of Sackville—Eastern Shore or its redistributed equivalents from the 1997 election until his defeat in the 2015 election. A member of the New Democratic Party, Stoffer served as the Official Opposition Critic for Veterans Affairs after his party became the official opposition after the 2011 election.

Stoffer is a grassroots politician who is a strong advocate for Canadian military veterans and their service needs. He has been an advocate of Third Way policies championed by Tony Blair. He was affiliated with the internal party reform group NDProgress that successfully pushed the NDP to adopt a &#x27;one member, one vote&#x27; system to choose its leader, and which has called for limits on union influence within the party.

Stoffer was alleged to have attempted to force kisses on a staffer in 2006 and 2009, in allegations made public in 2018. Stoffer denied any wrongdoing and stated that he never intended to &quot;...insult or demean or belittle any person...&quot;.

==Early life==
Stoffer was born in Heerlen, Netherlands in 1956 and emigrated with his family to Canada the same year. His father worked in the coal mines, but after the mines closed down in 1956, Stoffer&#x27;s family decided to move to Canada. His father became a mail carrier, his mother was a nurse and later they ran a group home for disabled youth. Stoffer is a former airline customer service agent and active union member who was also vocal on environmental issues.

==Federal politics==
In the 1997 election, Stoffer won his seat, Sackville—Eastern Shore, by 39 votes. Subsequently, however, he increased his margin of victory, in the 2004 election, his plurality was over 6,000 votes. In 2006, he took 53 per cent of the vote, the second placed candidate was over 12,000 votes behind. He was the only Nova Scotia NDP Member of Parliament elected in 1997 to have retained his seat, other than McDonough.

Stoffer represented the redistributed riding of Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore after the 2000 election. After the 2004 election, he was re-elected as an MP in an electoral district again renamed to Sackville—Eastern Shore.

During the 2003 NDP leadership convention, Stoffer was the campaign co-chair to Lorne Nystrom, a former long serving NDP MP from Saskatchewan. Days before the leadership convention, Stoffer let it be known to the media that his second ballot intention was to move to support Manitoba MP Bill Blaikie. At the convention, Toronto city councillor Jack Layton was elected on the first ballot.

===MP under Layton===
Stoffer has been critical of MPs who cross the floor and has repeatedly introduced a private member&#x27;s bill banning floor-crossing by Members of Parliament. His proposal, requiring MPs who leave their party to either resign and contest a by-election or sit as independents, was included in a list of demands issued by NDP leader Jack Layton in October 2005, in exchange for continued NDP support of the Liberal minority government. After David Emerson&#x27;s controversial decision to cross the floor, he has revived this idea.

In 2006 Stoffer withdrew his own private member&#x27;s bill aimed at preserving Canada&#x27;s neglected heritage lighthouses, in order to support similar legislation, Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act introduced by Conservative Senator Pat Carney.

In the federal election of 2008, Stoffer received 24,290 votes or 61.5 per cent of the total votes cast. He was more than 16,000 votes ahead of the candidate in second place.

In 2010, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine named him &quot;Most Collegial&quot; in its annual Parliamentarians of the Year awards. This was the second consecutive year that Stoffer received the award, which is voted on by fellow MPs.

===MP under Mulcair===
In 2012, Stoffer attracted controversy when he called Conservative MP Rob Anders &quot;a complete dickhead&quot; following comments Anders made insinuating that NDP leader Thomas Mulcair helped hasten the death of former NDP leader Jack Layton. Stoffer apologized to Anders the next day, calling his comments unparliamentary. In 2013, Stoffer was named Canada&#x27;s Parliamentarian of the Year by his peers in the seventh annual survey of Canada&#x27;s 305 sitting Members of Parliament (MPs) conducted by Ipsos Reid on behalf of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; in partnership with Historica Canada and &quot;L&#x27;Actualité&quot;, and is designed to honour the public service of Canada’s parliamentarians.

In January 2015, Stoffer declared his support for a Maritime Union of Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, saying that a union would lower the cost of government services by standardizing laws and regulations.

Stoffer was the Official Opposition Critic for Veterans&#x27; Affairs. He is a former critic for Fisheries and Oceans, Shipbuilding, Seniors, Amateur Sport, Canada Post Corporation, Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, and National Defence. In Ottawa on Parliament Hill, Stoffer has been consistently voted &quot;Most Fun MP to work for&quot; by &quot;The Hill Times&quot; newspaper, and is known for the &quot;All Party, Party&quot; – a non-partisan fundraiser for various charities.

==Out of the Commons==
Stoffer was defeated in the 2015 election as the Liberal party swept all the Atlantic Canada ridings. After his defeat, Stoffer proposed a number of changes for the NDP, including changing its name to the &quot;Democratic Party,&quot; disaffiliating the federal and provincial NDP parties, and removing the influence of the Canadian Labour Congress on the party.

==Personal life==
Stoffer lives in Fall River, Nova Scotia with his wife Andrea, his two daughters (Jasmin and Amber) and his dogs Angel and Buddy. On May 6, 2015, Stoffer was invested by the Dutch as a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau.

<text>The MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video was first given out in 1989, and it was one of the four original genre categories added at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. This award was last given out in 2006, as MTV did not bring it back in 2008 like it did with other genre awards. Instead, artists and videos that were previously eligible for Best Rap Video are now eligible for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video|Best Hip-Hop Video]]. Will Smith, Arrested Development, Dr. Dre, and Jay-Z are tied as this award&#x27;s biggest winners, each having won it twice.

<text>The [[MTV Video Music Award]] for Best R&amp;B was first awarded in 1993 under the name Best R&amp;B Video, and it was given every year until 2006. The following year MTV revamped the VMAs and eliminated all the genre categories. However, in 2008, when MTV returned the Video Music Awards to their previous format, Best R&amp;B Video did not return despite four other genre awards doing so. It was only in 2019 that the R&amp;B award returned to the VMAs, now under the shorter name of Best R&amp;B.

En Vogue, Destiny&#x27;s Child, Beyoncé, Alicia Keys, the Weeknd, and SZA are tied as this award&#x27;s biggest winners, each having won it twice. Keys is also the category&#x27;s biggest nominee, receiving her eighth nomination in 2023.

<text>The [[MTV Video Music Award]] for Best Hip Hop was first given out at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards. The award, according to MTV, was originally intended for hip hop-&quot;inspired&quot; songs, not necessarily actual hip hop music videos (which were instead honored by [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video|Best Rap Video]]). This explains the recognition of non-hip hop songs such as &quot;Thong Song&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Real (Remix)&quot;.

The award was not given out in 2007, as the VMAs were revamped and most original categories were eliminated, however, Best Hip Hop Video was reinstated in 2008. By then, though, the rules had relatively changed, as R&amp;B and rap videos also became eligible for nominations in this category since the awards for Best Rap Video and Best R&amp;B Video were not brought back.

Drake owns the most nominations, with a total of fourteen. Nicki Minaj has the most wins in this category, with a total of five moonmen.

<text>Johann Jakob Wettstein (also Wetstein; 5 March 1693 – 23 March 1754) was a Swiss theologian, best known as a New Testament critic.

==Biography==

===Youth and study===
Johann Jakob Wettstein was born in Basel. Among his tutors in theology was Samuel Werenfels (1657–1740), an influential anticipator of modern critical exegesis. While still a student, Wettstein began to direct his attention to the special pursuit of his life, the text of the Greek New Testament. A relative, Johann Wettstein, who was the university librarian, gave him permission to examine and collate the principal manuscripts of the New Testament in the library, and he copied the various readings which they contained into his copy of Gerard of Maastricht&#x27;s edition of the Greek text.

In 1713 in his public examination he defended a dissertation entitled &quot;De variis Novi Testamenti lectionibus&quot;, and sought to show that variety of readings did not detract from the authority of the Bible. Wettstein paid great attention also to Aramaic and Talmudic Hebrew. In the spring of 1714 he undertook an academic tour, which led him to Paris and England, the great object of his inquiry everywhere being to examine manuscripts of the New Testament. In 1716 he made the acquaintance of Richard Bentley at the University of Cambridge; Bentley took great interest in his work and persuaded him to return to Paris to collate carefully the &quot;Codex Ephraemi&quot;, Bentley having then in view a critical edition of the New Testament.

===Basel===
In July 1717 Wettstein returned to take the office of a deacon at large (&quot;diaconus communis&quot;) at Basel, a post which he held for three years, after which he became his father&#x27;s colleague and successor in the parish of St Leonard&#x27;s. At the same time he pursued his favourite study, and gave private lectures on New Testament exegesis. It was then that he decided to prepare a critical edition of the Textus Receptus (Greek New Testament). He had in the meantime broken with Bentley, whose famous &quot;Proposals&quot; appeared in 1720, based upon methodological issues.

Doubts had been swirling about Wettstein&#x27;s orthodoxy as early as the publication of his thesis in 1713, and he ultimately fell under suspicion of Socinianism when he was unwilling to defend the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. In 1728 his one-time friend and mentor Johann Ludwig Frey accused Wettstein of using textual criticism as a means of advancing Socinian theology, which was investigated by a committee of clergy at Basel. The charge was formally upheld and he was ultimately dismissed, in 1730, from his position at St. Leonhard&#x27;s.

===Amsterdam===
He then moved from Basel to Amsterdam, where another relative, Johann Heinrich Wettstein (1649–1726), had an important printing and publishing business. Here editions of the classics were being published, as well as Gerard of Maastricht&#x27;s edition of the Greek Testament. Wettstein had begun to print an edition of the Greek Testament, but this was suddenly stopped for some unknown reason. As soon as he reached Amsterdam, in 1730, he published anonymously the &quot;Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci editionem&quot;, which he had proposed should accompany his Greek Testament, and which was later republished by him, with additions, in 1751. The next year (1731) the Remonstrants offered him the chair of philosophy in their college at Amsterdam, vacated by the illness of Jean Leclerc, on condition that he clear himself of the suspicion of heresy. He returned to Basel, and received a reversal (22 March 1732) of the previous decision, and re-admission to all his clerical offices. But, on his becoming a candidate for the Hebrew chair at Basel, his orthodox opponents blocked his appointment, and he retired to Amsterdam.

At length, he was allowed to instruct the Remonstrant students in philosophy and Hebrew on certain humiliating conditions. For the rest of his life he continued as professor in the Remonstrant college, declining in 1745 the Greek chair at Basel. In 1746 he once more visited England, and collated Syriac manuscripts for his final, great work. At last this appeared in 1751–1752, in two folio volumes, under the title &quot;Novum Testamentum Graecum editionis receptae cum lectionibus variantibus codicum&quot; manuscripts, etc. He did not venture to put new readings in the body of his page, but consigned them to a place between the Textus Receptus and the full list of various readings. Beneath the latter he gave a commentary, consisting principally of a mass of valuable illustrations and parallels drawn from classical and rabbinical literature, which has formed a storehouse for all later commentators. In his &quot;Prolegomena&quot; he gave an admirable methodical account of the manuscripts, the versions and the readings of the fathers, as well as the troubled story of the difficulties with which he had had to contend in the prosecution of the work of his life. He was the first to designate uncial manuscripts by Roman capitals, and cursive manuscripts by Arabic figures. He did not long survive the completion of this work. He died in Amsterdam. 
===Work===
Wettstein rendered service to textual criticism by his collection of various readings and his methodical account of the manuscripts and other sources.

Through his laborious study of Codex Alexandrinus, he found misinterpretations or calculated mistakes of New Testament written in Greek. He came under particular fire for disputing the passage of 1 Timothy 3:16, believing the original reading to be &quot;which was manifest in the flesh,&quot; rather than &quot;God was manifest in the flesh.&quot; Through his studies he developed an increasingly critical attitude on textual matters and their relationship to doctrinal issues. Yet during the latter years of his life, he adopted the position that the oldest extant Greek manuscripts had been corrupted by influence of the Latin, resulting in his loss of confidence in those ancient copies, including Alexandrinus. Between 1751 and 1752 his &quot;Prolegomena&quot; and &quot;Novum Testamentum Graecum&quot; was published. Its base text was the 1624 version of the Elzevir Textus Receptus, with minor changes, with his preferred reading noted in the apparatus.

Some opponents considered his work to be less valuable because of his prejudice against the Latin version and the principle of grouping manuscripts in families, which had been recommended by Richard Bentley and J. A. Bengel.

Wettstein gives an account of his labours and trials in his &quot;Nov. Test. i.&quot;: 1751. &quot;Novum Testamentum Græcum editionis receptæ, cum Lectionibus Variantibus Codicum MSS., Editionum aliarum, Versionum et Patrum, necnon Commentario pleniore ex Scriptoribus veteribus, Hebræis, Græcis, et Latinis, historiam et vim verborum illustrante&quot;, in two volumes. Amsterdam: Amstelædami. Reprinted in 1962 by Graz, Austria: Akademische Druck-u. Verlagsanstalt.

<text>The [[MTV Video Music Award]] for Best Dance was first awarded in 1989, and it was one of the original four genre categories that were added to the MTV Video Music Awards that year. 

With a revamp of the awards in 2007, the category was cut out along with several others, yet it returned for the 2008 awards, where it was given a new name: Best Dancing in a Video. In 2009 the award for Best Dancing was again eliminated from the VMAs, but it was revived again in 2010 as Best Dance Music Video. The following year, though, the award was once again absent from the category list. Once again, the award was revived in 2012, this time under the name of Best Electronic Dance Music Video, celebrating the rise in popularity of EDM throughout the year. It was again eliminated from the 2013 awards. On July 17, 2014, MTV brought the category back, this time renaming it the MTV Clubland Award for the 2014 Awards. The pattern of awarding the Moonman every other year continued in 2016 where the award was renamed Best Electronic Video. Finally, in 2017 this award&#x27;s name was changed to Best Dance, which it has kept until the present. It was again eliminated from the 2020 awards and has not been awarded since.

En Vogue, The Pussycat Dolls, Calvin Harris and Zedd are the category&#x27;s biggest winners, with each having won it twice. Madonna and Janet Jackson, on the other hand, are the two most nominated artists, each having been nominated six times for this category; followed by Jennifer Lopez and Calvin Harris, who have been nominated five times.

<text>The [[MTV Video Music Award]] for Best Rock was first given out in , one of the four original genre categories added to the VMAs that year. In its first year, the award was called Best Heavy Metal Video, and from 1990 to 1995, it was renamed Best Metal/Hard Rock Video. The category underwent a third, brief name change in 1996, when it was renamed Best Hard Rock Video. In 1997, the award acquired its most enduring name, Best Rock Video, which it retained until 2016. The following year, the word &quot;Video&quot; was removed from all genre categories at the VMAs (despite nominations still going to specific videos), giving this award its current name: Best Rock.

Like all other genre categories at the VMAs, this category was retired briefly in , when the VMAs were revamped and most original categories were eliminated. In 2008, though, MTV brought back this award, along with several of the others that had been retired in 2007.

Aerosmith is the most frequent winner of this award, with a total of four wins between 1990 and 1998. The Foo Fighters are the most nominated acts in this category, having received ten nominations. Closely following them are Aerosmith and Linkin Park, with eight nominations. In 1995, White Zombie&#x27;s bassist Sean Yseult became the first woman to win this award, while in 2014, New Zealand singer Lorde became the first female solo act to win this male-dominated category.

<doc id="477264" wikidata="Q6928441" url="?curid=477264" title="Mr. Bill">
<text>Mr. Bill is a clay figurine star of a parody of children&#x27;s entertainment created by Walter Williams in 1974. The Mr. Bill showing got its start on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a series of Super 8 films sent in response to the show&#x27;s request for home movies during the first season. Mr. Bill&#x27;s first appearance occurred on the February 28, 1976 episode. After five submitted films, Williams became a full-time writer for the show in 1978 and wrote more than 20 sketches based on Mr. Bill.
Each Mr. Bill episode started innocently but quickly turned dangerous for Mr. Bill and his dog Spot. He would suffer various indignities inflicted by &quot;Mr. Hands&quot;, a man seen only as a pair of hands (originally performed by Vance DeGeneres). Sometimes the abuse came from Sluggo, another clay character, which Mr. Hands usually jokingly brands as one of Mr. Bill&#x27;s &quot;best friends&quot;. A running gag in the sketches is whenever Sluggo would make his appearance, Mr. Bill would get worried and say, &quot;He&#x27;s gonna be mean to me!&quot;, to which Mr. Hands often gives him reassurance by responding with, &quot;No!&quot;. The violence inevitably escalated, generally ending with Mr. Bill being crushed or dismembered while squealing &quot;Ohhhh noooooooooooooo!&quot; in a falsetto voice.

The concept for Mr. Hands came from Williams&#x27; observation that children&#x27;s cartoons in the 1970s were so static, he expected the artist&#x27;s hands to enter the screen at any moment and physically start moving the drawings around.

Initial &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketches featuring Mr. Bill were self-contained episodes with no direct continuity, with the earliest installments featuring higher-pitched character voices. After Walter Williams joined &quot;SNL&quot;″s writing staff in 1978, Mr. Bill formally moved to New York at the start of the season. Later sketches saw Mr. Bill become aware of Mr. Hands and Sluggo&#x27;s mistreatment, with the 1979–80 season harboring an extended story arc where Mr. Bill lost his home, sought psychiatric help, attempted to get Mr. Hands and Sluggo arrested, and was ultimately thrown into prison.

Williams left &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; after that season, but Mr. Bill returned for a Christmas short film in December 1980, as well as the sixth-season finale, where guest Chevy Chase found Mr. Bill in a garbage can. The last Mr. Bill sketch on &quot;SNL&quot; aired early in the 1981–1982 season, where Mr. Bill moved to Los Angeles. After &quot;SNL&quot;, Mr. Bill has appeared on numerous other television programs and advertisements, including regular new sketches on the USA Network series &quot;Night Flight&quot; in the 1980s and the Fox Family Channel series &quot;Ohh Nooo! Mr. Bill Presents&quot; in the 1990s.

<text>The [[MTV Video Music Award]] for Best Alternative (also known as Best Alternative Music Video) was first given out at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards. Prior to being called Best Alternative Video, it was known as Best Post-Modern Video in 1989 and 1990.

After the 1998 ceremony, this award was eliminated, and it was not presented until over two decades later, when it was brought back for the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards, under the name Best Alternative. During its discontinuation, artists and videos who would have normally been eligible for this award became eligible for other genre categories, including Best Rock Video.

Nirvana is the biggest winner of this award, winning all three of their consecutive bids for the Moonman from 1992 to 1994. In terms of nominations, though, there are a multitude of artists all with three nominations. These include Green Day, Nirvana, Willow, Machine Gun Kelly, Imagine Dragons and Twenty One Pilots.

<doc id="477269" wikidata="Q3269491" url="?curid=477269" title="Trial by media">
<text>Trial by media is a phrase popular in the late 20th century and early 21st century to describe the impact of television and newspaper coverage on a person&#x27;s reputation by creating a widespread perception of guilt or innocence before, or after, a verdict in a court of law. It is particularly relevant in cases where high-profile individuals stand trial, with the concern that the impartiality of the jury may be compromised by extraneous information, disrupting due process and resulting in an unfair trial.

== Etymology and early use ==
The concept was popularized for the first time as &quot;Trial by Television&quot; in response to the 3 February 1967 television broadcast of &quot;The Frost Programme&quot;, hosted by David Frost. The confrontation and Frost&#x27;s personal adversarial line of questioning of insurance fraudster Emil Savundra led to concern from ITV executives that it might affect Savundra&#x27;s right to a fair trial.

==Description==
During high-publicity court cases, the media are often accused of provoking an atmosphere of public hysteria akin to a lynch mob which not only makes a fair trial nearly impossible but means that regardless of the result of the trial, the accused will not be able to live the rest of their life without intense public scrutiny.

Although popularized in 1967, the idea that popular media can have a strong influence on the legal process goes back certainly to the development of the printing press and probably much further. This is not including the use of a state-controlled press to criminalize political opponents, but in its commonly understood meaning covers all occasions where the reputation of a person has been drastically affected by ostensibly non-political publications.

Often the coverage in the press can be said to reflect the views of the person in the street. However, more credibility is generally given to printed material than &#x27;water cooler gossip&#x27;. The responsibility of the press to confirm reports and leaks about individuals being tried has come under increasing scrutiny and journalists are calling for higher standards. There was much debate over U.S President Bill Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial and prosecutor Kenneth Starr&#x27;s investigation and how the media handled the trial by reporting commentary from lawyers which influenced public opinion.

In the United Kingdom, strict contempt of court regulations restrict the media&#x27;s reporting of legal proceedings after a person is formally arrested. These rules are designed so that a defendant receives a fair trial in front of a jury that has not been tainted by prior media coverage. The newspapers the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; have been prosecuted under these regulations, although such prosecutions are rare. It is also within the power of the courts to prevent the jury from accessing electronic devices during the course of the trial. Furthermore, court security officers are authorized to search for electronic devices that they suspect a juror may have failed to surrender as per the judge&#x27;s request. Consequently, to conduct research into the case using electronic devices, and indeed share this information with other jurors, is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to two years.

<text>RX J1242.6−1119A (often abbreviated RX J1242−11) is an elliptical galaxy located approximately 200 megaparsecs (about 650 million light-years) from Earth. According to current interpretations of X-ray observations made by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton, the center of this galaxy is a 100 million solar mass supermassive black hole which was observed to have tidally disrupted a star (in 1992 or shortly before). The discovery is widely considered to be the first strong evidence of a supermassive black hole ripping apart a star and consuming a portion of it.

==Location in the sky==
The location of RX J1242.6-1119A, as seen from Earth, is less than one degree to the northeast of Messier 104, the Sombrero Galaxy.

<text>The MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film was first awarded in 1987, recognizing the best videos whose songs were a part of a movie soundtrack or featured in a film. As time went on, though, music videos taken from movie soundtracks became more rare, and so the last of this award was given out in 2003. No artist has ever won this award more than once, though Madonna, Will Smith, and U2 are all winners who have been nominated a record three times for this award. U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr., however, are technically the most nominated artists of this category, for along with their three nominations with U2, they also received a nomination for their video for the &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; theme. In a similar vein, &quot;Singles&quot; and &quot;Batman Forever&quot; are the two most nominated films of this category, as they each had two videos off of their soundtracks receive nominations on their respective years.

<text>The MTV2 Award was first presented at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2001. The category recognized the best videos to have premiered and/or got their start on MTV&#x27;s sister channel, MTV2. Much like the Viewer&#x27;s Choice award, the MTV2 Award was also fan-voted. Until 2005, the award was considered to be one of the main awards of the night, even being presented on the main show; in 2006, though, the MTV2 Award was relegated to being handed out during a commercial break of the MTV2 simulcast of the VMAs. The following year, as the VMAs were revamped, the MTV2 Award was eliminated and subsequently never brought back.

<text>The [[MTV Video Music Award]] for Breakthrough Video was first awarded in 1988, replacing the award for [[MTV Video Music Award for Most Experimental Video|Most Experimental Video]]. Along with Best Direction in a Video, this award was considered to be one of the most important professional categories at the VMAs, as every once in a while it was even presented during the main show (unlike most technical awards which were presented during the pre-show).

The award for Breakthrough Video was given out every year from 1988 to 2005, after which it was retired. In 2009, however, MTV decided to bring back this category and continued to present it until 2010, after which it was retired again.

R.E.M. and Fatboy Slim are the two biggest winners of this award, as they each have won it twice. Art of Noise, meanwhile, is the only artist or group to have won this award under its two incarnations: Most Experimental Video in 1985 and Breakthrough Video in 1989.

<doc id="477287" wikidata="Q8069129" url="?curid=477287" title="Zenith number">
<text>A Zenith number was a telephone service in the United States that allowed a calling party to call the service subscriber at no charge by requesting the name &quot;Zenith&quot; and the number from a switchboard operator. The service preceded the system of toll-free telephone numbers with area code 800 in the United States. Some areas used the names &quot;Enterprise&quot; or &quot;WX&quot; number.

Introduced in the 1930s, a Zenith number was listed in local directories in each community from which a business desired to receive calls. In that era, direct-dial numbers were commonly published with telephone exchange names followed by digits, such as in the telephone number &quot;PEnnsylvania 6-5000&quot;.

The letter Z appeared on many telephone dials from the early 1930s to the 1950s at the same position as the label &quot;Operator&quot; with the digit &quot;0&quot;, indicating that the caller had to call the operator to place the call. The operator looked up the Zenith number to find the corresponding city and directory telephone number, and completed the call by charging it to the destination number.
For an organization expecting calls from a specific area but not very frequently, a Zenith number could provide savings over using foreign exchange (FX) service. For example, if a bus company had to provide a bus information number for callers in an area distant from its main office, and if a Zenith number cost $6 a month plus about $1.50 per call while an FX number cost $50 a month, then until the Zenith number regularly received at least 30 calls or more a month it would be cheaper than establishing foreign exchange service.

In the United States and Canada, usage of manual Zenith numbers diminished after the 1967 introduction of interstate direct-dial 800 area code InWATS toll-free service, and especially after 1982 when 800 calls no longer had to be placed via special fixed-rate trunks. A similar service in the United Kingdom, in which callers asked operators for &quot;Freephone (name or number)&quot;, had no direct-dial counterpart until 1985.

As direct-dial toll-free service declined in cost, Zenith numbers nearly disappeared; telephone companies in most service areas are no longer assigning new Zenith numbers.

A few organizations have continued to keep Zenith numbers. For example, , the California Highway Patrol continued to use its decades-old &quot;Zenith 1-2000&quot;, On its website it advertises 1-800-TELL-CHP.

<doc id="477291" wikidata="Q2061750" url="?curid=477291" title="Thanhouser Company">
<text>The Thanhouser Company (later the Thanhouser Film Corporation) was one of the first motion picture studios, founded in 1909 by Edwin Thanhouser, his wife Gertrude and his brother-in-law Lloyd Lonergan. It operated in New York City until 1920, producing over a thousand films.

==Corporate history==
Edwin Thanhouser constructed a studio in New Rochelle, New York. The company thrived under his leadership and by the summer of 1910, it had established itself as the best of the independents in the industry. Frank E. Woods of the American Biograph Company would pen an editorial in &quot;The New York Dramatic Mirror&quot; as &quot;The Spectator&quot;, praising the Thanhouser company to this effect.

It was sold to Mutual Film Corporation on April 15, 1912, for $250,000. Charles J. Hite took charge.

On January 13, 1913, a fire destroyed the main facility in New Rochelle; much equipment and many costumes and negatives of films in production were lost. However, subsidiary studios that had been set up were able to meet distributors&#x27; needs while it was being rebuilt.

After Hite&#x27;s death in an automobile accident, the company continued for another five years. After a period of floundering under inexperienced leadership, Edwin Thanhouser was hired to take charge, but he could not recreate the success of his earlier years. The film industry had evolved and was more competitive by this time, and although films featuring star Florence La Badie were still successful, other ventures were not. La Badie left Thanhouser Corporation in 1917, only weeks before her own death on October 13, 1917, due to injuries sustained in an automobile accident in late August. In 1920, Thanhouser Corporation was liquidated.

== Releases of 1910 ==
The Thanhouser Company&#x27;s first release was &quot;The Actor&#x27;s Children&quot; on March 15, 1910. The plot focused on a family of theater actors who struggle to pay the rent. While the parents are out, their kids are left out on the street where they dance to the music of an organ grinder. They are later rescued by a theater manager and are reunited with their parents at the theater. The film&#x27;s conclusion is an example of the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; dramatic technique, which Lonergan used to conclude many scenarios. Though it was the first release, it was not the first film to be produced; the first film produced was &quot;The Mad Hermit&quot;. Produced in the autumn of 1909, &quot;The Mad Hermit&quot; would not be released until August 1910. According to Lloyd Lonergan, the first script he wrote was for &quot;Aunt Nancy Telegraphs&quot;, which was shot in December 1909 but never released.

The next release would be an adaptation of Augusta Jane Evans&#x27;s novel &quot;St. Elmo&quot;. The Thanhouser version of &quot;St. Elmo&quot; would bring the company some recognition and would prove to be a success, but the film is also presumed lost. Thanhouser would release two more original scenarios, &quot;She&#x27;s Done it Again&quot; and &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Double&quot;, before attempting two productions on the same reel. Released on April 15, 1910, &quot;A 29-Cent Robbery&quot; was included with &quot;The Old Shoe Came Back&quot;, a short comedy filler subject. The main subject, &quot;A 29-Cent Robbery&quot;, was the debut of Marie Eline, soon to be famously known as the &quot;Thanhouser Kid&quot;. Two more split reels would follow before the release of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Productions adapted from novels included Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Marie Corelli&#x27;s &quot;Thelma&quot; and Mary Jane Holmes&#x27;s &quot;Tempest and Sunshine&quot;.

More adaptations of classic works, like &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, would be interspersed with several original scenarios like &quot;The Mermaid&quot; and &quot;The Restoration&quot;. On August 9, &quot;The Mad Hermit&quot; was released and Edwin Thanhouser&#x27;s fears of it being an amateur production were unfounded. Films in the autumn included novel plots like &quot;Dots and Dashes&quot;, where Morse code facilitates a man&#x27;s escape from a safe. As Halloween approached, the company released &quot;The Fairies&#x27; Hallowe&#x27;en&quot;, a trick film geared towards child audiences. &quot;A Thanksgiving Surprise&quot; would also be released in time for Thanksgiving.

The winter of 1910 saw more adaptations of classics and short stories, including &quot;Paul and Virginia&quot;, &quot;John Halifax, Gentleman&quot;, &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; and &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot;. &quot;Love and Law&quot; was released on December 17, it was to be the first of four films in the &quot;Violet Gray, Detective&quot; series though it was originally billed as part of the &quot;Thanhouser Detective Series&quot;. Previously Thanhouser had released another film about a woman reporter who uncovered a political corruption in &quot;The Girl Reporter&quot; and a young woman who does the same in &quot;A Dainty Politician&quot;. Thanhouser would also release &quot;Looking Forward&quot;, an adaptation of James Oliver Curwood&#x27;s story, where a young chemist awakes a century later to a world run by women. The last release of the year was &quot;Hypnotized&quot;, focusing on a traveling show with an ill-intentioned hypnotist.

== Filmography ==

Thanhouser produced over 1,000 silent films. Among these were:
* &quot;The Cry of the Children&quot;: Selected in 2011 by the National Film Preservation Board of the Library of Congress for inclusion in the National Film Registry, which recognizes films for their cultural, historical and aesthetic significance. The Film Preservation Board described this two-reel melodrama from 1912, part of which was filmed in a working textile mill, as a &quot;key work&quot; in relation to the U.S. movement for child labor reform in the years before World War I. According to the Film Preservation Board, an &quot;influential critic of the time&quot; called it &quot;the boldest, most timely and most effective appeal for the stamping out of the cruelest of all social abuses.&quot;
* &quot;The Evidence of the Film&quot;: A 15-minute film from 1913, among the 25 films selected for the National Film Registry in 2001
* &quot;When the Studio Burned&quot;: On January 13, 1913 (three days after the release of &quot;The Evidence of the Film&quot;), the main facility of the Thanhouser studio in New Rochelle, New York burned to the ground. Most of the negatives in the studio&#x27;s film library were saved. However, in the scramble to save lives, business files and the film library, none of the company&#x27;s cameramen were able to set up their equipment until after the studio was a smoldering ruin. Thanks to Thanhouser&#x27;s recent acquisitions of production facilities in Los Angeles and Chicago, the studio was able to produce this 14-minute fictional film about the fire. The film, which included many of the studio&#x27;s stars appearing as themselves recreating their escape from the fire, was released on February 4, 1913.

<doc id="477292" wikidata="Q107184" url="?curid=477292" title="Copper(II) sulfate">
<text>Copper(II) sulfate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula . It forms hydrates , where &quot;n&quot; can range from 1 to 7. The pentahydrate (&quot;n&quot; = 5), a bright blue crystal, is the most commonly encountered hydrate of copper(II) sulfate, while its anhydrous form is white. Older names for the pentahydrate include blue vitriol, bluestone, vitriol of copper, and Roman vitriol. It exothermically dissolves in water to give the aquo complex , which has octahedral molecular geometry. The structure of the solid pentahydrate reveals a polymeric structure wherein copper is again octahedral but bound to four water ligands. The centers are interconnected by sulfate anions to form chains.

==Preparation and occurrence==

Copper sulfate is produced industrially by treating copper metal with hot concentrated sulfuric acid or copper oxides with dilute sulfuric acid. For laboratory use, copper sulfate is usually purchased. Copper sulfate can also be produced by slowly leaching low-grade copper ore in air; bacteria may be used to hasten the process.

Commercial copper sulfate is usually about 98% pure copper sulfate, and may contain traces of water. Anhydrous copper sulfate is 39.81% copper and 60.19% sulfate by mass, and in its blue, hydrous form, it is 25.47% copper, 38.47% sulfate (12.82% sulfur) and 36.06% water by mass. Four types of crystal size are provided based on its usage: large crystals (10–40 mm), small crystals (2–10 mm), snow crystals (less than 2 mm), and windswept powder (less than 0.15 mm).

==Chemical properties==
Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate decomposes before melting. It loses two water molecules upon heating at , followed by two more at and the final water molecule at .

The chemistry of aqueous copper sulfate is simply that of copper aquo complex, since the sulfate is not bound to copper in such solutions. Thus, such solutions react with concentrated hydrochloric acid to give tetrachlorocuprate(II):
Similarly treatment of such solutions with zinc gives metallic copper, as described by this simplified equation:

A further illustration of such single metal replacement reactions occurs when a piece of iron is submerged in a solution of copper sulfate:
In high school and general chemistry education, copper sulfate is used as an electrolyte for galvanic cells, usually as a cathode solution. For example, in a zinc/copper cell, copper ion in copper sulfate solution absorbs electron from zinc and forms metallic copper.
:, E°cell = 0.34 V

Copper sulfate is commonly included in teenage chemistry sets and undergraduate experiments. It is often used to grow crystals in schools and in Copper electroplating experiments despite its toxicity. Copper sulfate is often used to demonstrate an exothermic reaction, in which steel wool or magnesium ribbon is placed in an aqueous solution of . It is used to demonstrate the principle of mineral hydration. The pentahydrate form, which is blue, is heated, turning the copper sulfate into the anhydrous form which is white, while the water that was present in the pentahydrate form evaporates. When water is then added to the anhydrous compound, it turns back into the pentahydrate form, regaining its blue color. Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate can easily be produced by crystallization from solution as copper(II) sulfate, which is hygroscopic.

==Uses==

===As a fungicide and herbicide===
Copper sulfate has been used for control of algae in lakes and related fresh waters subject to eutrophication. It &quot;remains the most effective algicidal treatment&quot;.

Bordeaux mixture, a suspension of copper(II) sulfate () and calcium hydroxide (), is used to control fungus on grapes, melons, and other berries. It is produced by mixing a water solution of copper sulfate and a suspension of slaked lime.
A dilute solution of copper sulfate is used to treat aquarium fishes for parasitic infections, and is also used to remove snails from aquariums and zebra mussels from water pipes. Copper ions are highly toxic to fish. Most species of algae can be controlled with very low concentrations of copper sulfate.

===Analytical reagent===
Several chemical tests utilize copper sulfate. It is used in Fehling&#x27;s solution and Benedict&#x27;s solution to test for reducing sugars, which reduce the soluble blue copper(II) sulfate to insoluble red copper(I) oxide. Copper(II) sulfate is also used in the Biuret reagent to test for proteins.

Copper sulfate is used to test blood for anemia. The blood is dropped into a solution of copper sulfate of known specific gravity—blood with sufficient hemoglobin sinks rapidly due to its density, whereas blood which sinks slowly or not at all has an insufficient amount of hemoglobin. Clinically relevant, however, modern laboratories utilize automated blood analyzers for accurate quantitative hemoglobin determinations, as opposed to older qualitative means.

In a flame test, the copper ions of copper sulfate emit a deep green light, a much deeper green than the flame test for barium.

===Organic synthesis===
Copper sulfate is employed at a limited level in organic synthesis. The anhydrous salt is used as a dehydrating agent for forming and manipulating acetal groups. The hydrated salt can be intimately mingled with potassium permanganate to give an oxidant for the conversion of primary alcohols.

=== Rayon production===
Reaction with ammonium hydroxide yields tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate or Schweizer&#x27;s reagent which was used to dissolve cellulose in the industrial production of Rayon.

===Niche uses===
Copper(II) sulfate has attracted many niche applications over the centuries. In industry copper sulfate has multiple applications. In printing it is an additive to book-binding pastes and glues to protect paper from insect bites; in building it is used as an additive to concrete to improve water resistance and prevent plant and mushroom growth. Copper sulfate can be used as a coloring ingredient in artworks, especially glasses and potteries. Copper sulfate is also used in firework manufacture as a blue coloring agent, but it is not safe to mix copper sulfate with chlorates when mixing firework powders.

Copper sulfate was once used to kill bromeliads, which serve as mosquito breeding sites. Copper sulfate is used as a molluscicide to treat bilharzia in tropical countries.

====Art====
In 2008, the artist Roger Hiorns filled an abandoned waterproofed council flat in London with 75,000 liters of copper(II) sulfate water solution. The solution was left to crystallize for several weeks before the flat was drained, leaving crystal-covered walls, floors and ceilings. The work is titled &quot;Seizure&quot;. Since 2011, it has been on exhibition at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.

====Etching====
Copper(II) sulfate is used to etch zinc, aluminium, or copper plates for intaglio printmaking.
It is also used to etch designs into copper for jewelry, such as for Champlevé.

====Dyeing====
Copper(II) sulfate can be used as a mordant in vegetable dyeing. It often highlights the green tints of the specific dyes.

====Electronics====
An aqueous solution of copper(II) sulfate is often used as the resistive element in liquid resistors.

In electronic and microelectronic industry a bath of and sulfuric acid () is often used for electrodeposition of copper.

==Other forms of copper sulfate==
Anhydrous copper(II) sulfate can be produced by dehydration of the commonly available pentahydrate copper sulfate. In nature, it is found as the very rare mineral known as chalcocyanite. The pentahydrate also occurs in nature as chalcanthite. Other rare copper sulfate minerals include bonattite (trihydrate), boothite (heptahydrate), and the monohydrate compound poitevinite. There are numerous other, more complex, copper(II) sulfate minerals known, with environmentally important basic copper(II) sulfates like langite and posnjakite.
== Toxicological effects ==

Copper(II) salts have an LD50 of 100 mg/kg.

Copper(II) sulfate was used in the past as an emetic. It is now considered too toxic for this use. It is still listed as an antidote in the World Health Organization&#x27;s Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System.

<doc id="477294" wikidata="Q1297383" url="?curid=477294" title="Egg cream">
<text>An egg cream is a cold beverage consisting of milk, carbonated water, and flavored syrup (typically chocolate or vanilla), as a substitute for an ice cream float. Ideally, the glass is left with liquid and foamy head. Despite the name, the drink contains neither eggs nor cream.

The egg cream is almost exclusively a fountain drink. Although there have been several attempts to bottle it, none have been wholly successful, as its refreshing taste and characteristic head require mixing of the ingredients just before drinking.

==Etymology theories and speculations==
The peculiarity that an egg cream contains neither eggs nor cream has been explained in various ways. Stanley Auster, who claims that his grandfather invented the beverage, has said that the origins of the name are &quot;lost in time.&quot;

The egg cream originated among Yiddish-speaking Eastern European Jewish immigrants in New York City, so one explanation claims that &quot;egg&quot; is a corruption of the Yiddish (&#x27;genuine&#x27; or &#x27;real&#x27;), making an egg cream a &quot;good cream&quot;.

Food historian Andrew Smith writes: &quot;During the 1880s, a popular specialty was made with chocolate syrup, cream, and raw eggs mixed into soda water. In poorer neighborhoods, a less expensive version of this treat was created, called the Egg Cream (made without the eggs or cream).&quot;

Another explanation comes from reports that it grew out of a request for from someone, possibly the actor Boris Thomashefsky (who had experienced a similar drink in Paris.) His heavy accent altered the name into something like &quot;egg cream,&quot; which then developed into the current term.

<doc id="477295" wikidata="Q95964" url="?curid=477295" title="Johann August Nauck">
<text>Johann August Nauck (18 September 1822 – 3 August 1892) was a German classical scholar and critic. His chief work was the &quot;Tragicorum Graecorum Fragmenta&quot; (&quot;TrGF&quot;).

== Biography ==
Nauck was born at Auerstedt in present-day Thuringia. He studied at the University of Halle as a student of Gottfried Bernhardy and Moritz Hermann Eduard Meier. In 1853 he became an adjunct under August Meineke at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in Berlin. After a brief stint as an educator at the &quot;Grauen Kloster&quot; (1858), he relocated to St. Petersburg, where in 1869, he was appointed professor of Greek at the historical-philological institute.

Nauck was one of the most distinguished textual critics of his day, although, like PH Peerlkamp, he was fond of altering a text in accordance with what he thought the author must, or ought to, have written. Nauck was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1885.

== Published works ==
The most important of his writings and translations, all of which deal with Greek language and literature (especially the tragedians) are as follows:
* Fragments of Aristophanes of Byzantium (1848).
* &quot;Euripidis Tragoediae superstites et deperditarum fragmenta; ex recensione Augusti Nauckii&quot;, (1854). (Euripides, tragedies and fragments)
* &quot;Tragicorum Graecorum Fragmenta&quot; (1856, last edition, 1983), His chief work — it was intended as a counterpart to Meineke&#x27;s &quot;comedy fragments&quot;, (&quot;&quot;Fragmenta comicorum graecorum&quot;).
* Revised edition of Schneidewin&#x27;s annotated Sophocles (1856, etc.)
* Porphyrius of Tyre (1860, 2nd ed., 1886); &quot;Porphyrii philosophi Platonici opuscula selecta&quot;.
* &quot;Lexikon Vindobonense&quot; (1867).
* texts of Homer, &quot;Odyssey&quot; (1874) and &quot;Iliad&quot; (1877–1879); published as &quot;Homerica carmina&quot;&quot; (volume I. Ilias; volume II. Odyssea).
* Iamblichus, &quot;De Vita Pythagorica&quot; (1884).

<text>Petrus Hofman Peerlkamp (Groningen, February 2, 1786 - Hilversum, March 28 1865) was a Dutch classical scholar and critic.

==Life==
He was descended from a family of French refugees named Perlechamp, was born at Groningen.

He was professor of ancient literature and universal history at Leiden from 1822 to 1849, when he resigned his post and retired to Hilversum, where he died on 28 March 1865.

He was the founder of the subjective method of textual criticism, which consisted in rejecting in a classical author whatever failed to come up to the standard of what that author, in the critic&#x27;s opinion, ought to have written. His ingenuity in this direction, in which he went much further than Bentley, was chiefly exercised on the &quot;Odes&quot; of Horace (the greater part of which he declared spurious), and the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil.

He also edited the &quot;Ars poetica&quot; and &quot;Satires&quot; of Horace, the &quot;Agricola&quot; of Tacitus, the romance of Xenophon of Ephesus, and was the author of a history of the Latin poets of the Netherlands (&quot;De vita, doctrina, et facultate Nederlandorum qui carmina latina composuerunt&quot;, 1838).

See L Müller, &quot;Gesch. der klassischen Philologie in den Niederlandes&quot; (1869), and JE Sandys, &quot;Hist. of Class. Schol.&quot; (1908), ii. 276.

<doc id="477327" wikidata="Q961357" url="?curid=477327" title="United States five-dollar bill">
<text>The United States five-dollar bill (US$5) is a denomination of United States currency. The current $5 bill features U.S. president Abraham Lincoln and the Great Seal of the United States on the front and the Lincoln Memorial on the back. All $5 bills issued today are Federal Reserve Notes. , the average life of a $5 bill in circulation is 4.7 years before it is replaced due to wear. Approximately 6% of all paper currency produced by the U.S. Treasury&#x27;s Bureau of Engraving and Printing in 2009 were $5 bills.

Although sometimes nicknamed a &quot;fin&quot;, which has German/Yiddish roots and is remotely related to the English &quot;five&quot;, the term is currently far less common than it was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is also occasionally referred to as a “fiver”.

==Current design==
The redesigned $5 bill was unveiled on September 20, 2007, and was issued on March 13, 2008, during a ceremony at President Lincoln&#x27;s Cottage.

===Security features===
New and enhanced security features make it easier to check the new $5 bill and more difficult for potential counterfeiters to reproduce. The redesigned $5 bill has:

*Watermarks: There are now two watermarks. A large numeral &quot;5&quot; watermark is located in a blank space to the right of the portrait, replacing the watermark portrait of President Lincoln found on previous bills. A second watermark — a new column of three smaller &quot;5&quot;s — has been added and is positioned to the left of the portrait.
*Security thread: The embedded security thread runs vertically and is now located to the right of the portrait. The letters &quot;USA&quot; followed by the number &quot;5&quot; in an alternating pattern are visible along the thread from both sides of the bill. The thread glows blue when held under ultraviolet light (blacklight).
*Microprinting: The redesigned $5 bill features microprinting, which is the engraving of tiny text, on the front of the bill in three areas: the words &quot;FIVE DOLLARS&quot; can be found repeated inside the left and right borders of the bill; the words &quot;E PLURIBUS UNUM&quot; appear at the top of the shield within the Great Seal; and the word &quot;USA&quot; is repeated in between the columns of the shield. On the back of the bill the words &quot;USA FIVE&quot; appear along one edge of the large purple &quot;5&quot;. Because they are so small, these microprinted words are hard to replicate.
*Red and Blue Threads: Some small red and blue threads are embedded into the paper to reveal if a higher denomination counterfeit bill has been printed on the bleached paper of a genuine lower denomination bill.
*Infrared Ink: The back of the five-dollar bill features sections of the bill that are blanked out when viewed in the infrared spectrum. This is consistent with other high-value US bills ($5 and up), which all feature patterns of infrared-visible stripes unique to the given denomination. Bills of other world currencies, such as the Euro, also feature unique patterns visible only when viewed in this spectrum.
*Anti-Photocopy Circle Pattern: Small yellow &quot;05&quot;s are printed to the left of the portrait on the front of the bill and to the right of the Lincoln Memorial vignette on the back. The zeros in the &quot;05&quot;s form a &quot;EURion constellation&quot; to prevent photocopying of the bill. Photocopy machines detect the particular pattern of yellow circles and refuse to make a copy. Some machines make a record of the illegal photocopy attempt, which a repair technician may report to law enforcement.

The five dollar bill lacks the optically variable ink of higher denomination US bills.

===Design features===
The new $5 bills remain the same size and use the same—but enhanced—portraits and historical images. The most noticeable difference is the light-purple coloring of the center of the bill, which blends into gray near the edges.

Similar to the recently redesigned $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills, the new $5 bill features an American symbol of freedom printed in the background: The Great Seal of the United States, featuring an eagle and shield, is printed in purple to the right of the portrait and an arc of purple stars surround both it and the portrait.

When the Lincoln Memorial was constructed the names of 48 states were engraved on it. The picture of the Lincoln Memorial on the $5 bill only contains the names of 26 states. These are the 26 states that can be seen on the front side of the Lincoln memorial which is what is pictured on the $5 bill.

On the back of the bill, a larger, purple numeral &quot;5&quot; appears in the lower right corner to help those with visual impairments to distinguish the denomination. This large &quot;5&quot; also includes the words &quot;USA FIVE&quot; in tiny white letters.

The oval borders around President Lincoln&#x27;s portrait on the front, and the Lincoln Memorial vignette on the back have been removed. Both engravings have been enhanced.

==Proposed redesign ==
On April 20, 2016, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew announced that the $5, $10, and $20 would all undergo redesign prior to 2020. The changes would add new features to combat counterfeiting and make them easier for blind citizens to distinguish. Lew said that while Lincoln would remain on the obverse, the reverse would be redesigned to depict various historical events that had occurred at the Lincoln Memorial. Among the planned designs are images from Martin Luther King Jr. giving his 1963 speech &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; and the 1939 concert by opera singer Marian Anderson. , the Treasury has continued work on the $20 bill; the redesigns of the $5 and $10 were not mentioned.

<text>Tocotronic is a German rock band formed in 1993. Similar to Blumfeld or Die Sterne they are considered a part of the Hamburger Schule (&quot;Hamburg School&quot;) movement. They are influential for bands such as Wir sind Helden.

==History==
Tocotronic were signed by L&#x27;Age D&#x27;Or, a German independent record label situated in Hamburg, in 1994 after quickly gaining popularity in the local scene. Their early style consists of ironic sloganeering (&quot;I want to be part of a youth movement&quot;) and almost diary-like songwriting, paired with a lo-fi rock sound with elements of punk rock and grunge. In 1995, they released their debut album &quot;Digital ist besser&quot; (Digital is better), followed by their second album &quot;Nach der verlorenen Zeit&quot; (After the Lost Time) only a few months later. Their third album, released in 1996, was the first to hit the German charts. The music became more complex over time, their lyrics less direct, resulting in a sound that was compared to that of Pavement on Tocotronic&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;K.O.O.K&quot;. The self-titled &quot;White Album&quot;, released in 2002, features dreamlike songs; metaphoric, heavily produced, highly polished, it completes a slow but steady course away from their early works (&quot;eins zu eins ist jetzt vorbei&quot; – &quot;one-to-one is over now&quot;).

Despite never being overly commercially successful, Tocotronic have a steady fanbase in Germany and their records are regularly reviewed and acclaimed in mainstream newspapers and music magazines alike.

In July 2007, Tocotronic released their eighth studio album, &quot;Kapitulation&quot;. Also, around this time, the band announced the end of their working relationship with long-time label L&#x27;age D&#x27;or, and consequently, &quot;Kapitulation&quot; was released by Vertigo Berlin, a sublabel of Universal music. Their ninth studio album, &quot;Schall &amp; Wahn&quot;, was released in January 2010 and became their first number-one record. &quot;Wie Wir Leben Wollen&quot;, was released on 25 January 2013 and &quot;Tocotronic&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Das Rote Album&quot;, or &quot;The Red Album&quot;) was released on 1 May 2015. Their latest album &quot;Nie wieder Krieg&quot; came out in January 2022. It is their thirteenth release.

The current band members and positions are Jan Müller (bass), Arne Zank (drums), Dirk von Lowtzow (rhythm guitar, vocals), and, since 2004, Rick McPhail (lead guitar, keyboard).

<doc id="477331" wikidata="Q4159284" url="?curid=477331" title="United States ten-dollar bill">
<text>The United States ten-dollar bill (US$10) is a denomination of U.S. currency. The obverse of the bill features the portrait of Alexander Hamilton, who served as the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, two renditions of the torch of the Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;), and the words &quot;We the People&quot; from the original engrossed preamble of the United States Constitution. The reverse features the U.S. Treasury Building. All $10 bills issued today are Federal Reserve Notes.

As of December 2018, the average life of a $10 bill in circulation is 5.3 years before it is replaced due to wear. Ten-dollar bills are delivered by Federal Reserve Banks bound with yellow straps.

The source of Hamilton&#x27;s portrait on the $10 bill is John Trumbull&#x27;s 1805 painting that belongs to the portrait collection of New York City Hall. The $10 bill is unique in that it is the only denomination in circulation in which the portrait faces to the left. It also features one of two non-presidents on currently issued U.S. bills, the other being Benjamin Franklin on the $100 bill. Hamilton is also the only person not born in the continental United States or British America (he was from the West Indies) currently depicted on U.S. paper currency; three others have been depicted in the past: Albert Gallatin, Switzerland ($500 1862/63 Legal Tender), George Meade, Spain ( 1890/91 Treasury Note), and Robert Morris, England ( 1862/63 Legal Tender; $10 1878/80 Silver Certificate).

== Large size note history ==
&quot;( 7.4218 × 3.125 in ≅ 189 × 79 mm)&quot;

* The Roman numeral &quot;X&quot; may represent the origin of the slang term &quot;sawbuck&quot; to mean a $10 bill.
* The notes could also be spent for exactly $10.
* It is unknown if the note could actually be spent for $10 plus interest.
* This note is nicknamed a &quot;jackass note&quot; because the eagle on the front looks like a donkey when the note is turned upside down.
* The back of the bill featured a vignette of U.S. gold coins.

* The blue and green tinting that was present on the obverse was removed and the design on the reverse was completely changed.
* The reverse, unlike any other federally issued note, was printed in black ink and featured the word in large block letters.
* 
* The note featured a portrait of General Philip Sheridan. The reverse featured an ornate design that took up almost the entire note.

* This United States Note was the only one to mention the legal provision that authorized its issuance. The reverse featured an allegorical figure representing Columbia between two Roman-styled pillars.
* It had a blue seal, and a woman on the reverse.
* 
* The note initially had a red treasury seal and serial numbers; however, they were changed to blue.

* The obverse was similar to the 1914 Federal Reserve notes except for large wording in the middle of the bill and a portrait with no border on the left side of the bill. Each note was an obligation of the issuing bank and could only be redeemed at the corresponding bank.
* Some of the design aspects of this note, such as the bottom border and numeral 10 overprinted with the word , were transferred over to the series of 1928 $10 bill.

==Small size note history==



* All variations of the bill would carry the same portrait of Alexander Hamilton, same border design on the obverse, and the same reverse with a vignette of the U.S. Treasury building. The bill was issued as a Federal Reserve Note with a green seal and serial numbers and as a gold certificate with a golden seal and serial numbers. The car parked outside of the Treasury Department building is based on a number of different cars manufactured at the time and was the creation of the Bureau designer who developed the artwork that served as a model for the engraving, because government agencies were prohibited from endorsing any specific manufacturer or product, according to a bureau of engraving and printing pamphlet. The tiny building to the right rear of the treasury building is the American Security and Trust Company Building, which for some years advertised itself as &quot;right on the money&quot;.
* This was the only small-sized bill that had a different border design on the obverse. The serial numbers and seal on it were brown.
* The obverse had a similar design style to the 1928 Silver Certificates; however, phrasing on the bill was different from the bill. This issue, with the series date of 1933, was not widely released into general circulation. Surviving examples of these notes are quite rare and valued at $10,000 to $30,000 in the numismatic community depending on their condition.
* Phrasing on the certificate was changed to reflect the American Silver Purchase Act of 1934.
* A Silver Certificate was printed with a yellow instead of blue treasury seal; these notes were given to U.S. troops in North Africa. These notes, too, could be declared worthless if seized by the enemy.
* Most noticeably, the treasury seal, gray word , and the Federal Reserve Seal were made smaller, the words were added between them and the serial number; also, the Federal Reserve seal had spikes added around it, like the Treasury seal.
* Also, the obligation was shortened to its current wording, . Also during this time, production of Silver Certificates ends.
* 
* Even though the notes read Series 1990, the first bills were printed in July 1992.
* The major changes were a revised, larger, slightly off-center portrait of Hamilton and a revised vignette of the U.S. Treasury building, now positioned face-on. The plastic security strip reads &quot;USA TEN&quot; and now glows orange under a black light. Like the new , the bills were first printed in December 1999.
* The reverse features small yellow EURion 10s and have the fine lines removed from around the vignette of the United States Treasury building. These notes were issued in series 2004A with Cabral-Snow signatures. The first notes were printed in July 2005.

== Proposed redesigns of the ten-dollar bill ==
In 2015, the multi-agency Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence Steering Committee (ACD) developed a schedule for the next generation of US bills, known as Catalyst, which will contain new security and anti-counterfeiting features as well as increased accessibility for the blind and visually impared. On June 17, 2015, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced that a woman&#x27;s portrait would be featured on a redesigned ten-dollar bill by 2020, although the ACD was not planning for it to be production ready until 2026. The Department of Treasury was seeking the public&#x27;s input on who should appear on the new bill during the design phase.

Removal of Hamilton was controversial. Many believed that Hamilton, as the first Secretary of the Treasury, should remain on U.S. Currency in some form, all the while thinking that U.S. Currency was long overdue to feature a female historical figure – names that had been raised included Eleanor Roosevelt, Harriet Tubman, and Susan B. Anthony. This led to the Treasury Department stating that Hamilton would remain on the bill in some way. The $10 bill was chosen because it was scheduled for a regular security redesign, a years-long process. The redesigned ten-dollar bill was to be the first U.S. note to incorporate tactile features to assist those with visual disabilities.

On April 20, 2016, it was announced that Alexander Hamilton would remain the primary face on the $10 bill, due in part to the sudden popularity of the first Treasury Secretary after the success of the 2015 Broadway musical &quot;Hamilton&quot;. It was simultaneously announced that Harriet Tubman&#x27;s likeness would appear on the $20 bill while Andrew Jackson would now appear on the reverse with the White House. The 2016 design for the reverse of the new $10 bill was set to feature the heroines of the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Movement in the United States, including Susan B. Anthony, Alice Paul, Sojourner Truth, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and the participants of the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession who marched in Washington, D.C., in favor of full voting rights for American women.

In August 2017, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) began development of the Catalyst $10 and $50 bills. As of October 2022, the plan was to release a new $10 bill in 2026, $50 bill in 2028, $20 bill in 2030 followed later by a new $5 then $100 notes later in the 2030s. The new bills will include &quot;raised tactile features&quot; for the blind and visually impaired which will be applied as part of the intaglio printing process. Due to the development of the bill&#x27;s security features, the designs of the new bills will likely be released 6 months before each bill is issued.

Andrew Jackson has appeared on the $20 bill since the series of 1928. The placement of Jackson on the $20 bill is considered ironic; as president, he vehemently opposed both the National Bank and use of paper money. After the president of the Second Bank of the United States, Nicholas Biddle, defied Jackson and requested the renewal of the charter of the Second Bank in an election year, Jackson responded by making it a goal of his administration to destroy the National Bank. Jackson prevailed over Biddle, and the absence of the Second Bank contributed to a real estate bubble in the mid-1830s. The bubble collapsed in the Panic of 1837, leading to a deep depression.

Given Jackson&#x27;s opposition to the concept of a National Bank, his presence on the $20 bill was controversial from the start. When pressed to reveal why the various images were chosen for the new bills, Treasury officials denied there was any political motivation. Instead, they insisted that the images were based only on their relative familiarity to the public. An article in the June 30, 1929 issue of the New York Times, stated &quot;The Treasury Department maintains stoutly that the men chosen for small bills, which are naturally the ones in most demand, were so placed because their faces were most familiar to the majority of people.&quot; It is also true that 1928 coincides with the 100th anniversary of Jackson&#x27;s election as president, but no evidence has surfaced that would suggest that this was a factor in the decision. According to more recent inquiries of the U.S. Treasury: &quot;Treasury Department records do not reveal the reason that portraits of these particular statesmen were chosen in preference to those of other persons of equal importance and prominence.&quot;

* 1914: Began as a large-sized note, a portrait of Grover Cleveland on the face, and, on the back, a steam locomotive and an automobile approaching from the left, and a steamship approaching from the right.
* 1928: Switched to a small-sized note with a portrait of Andrew Jackson on the face and the south view of the White House on the reverse. The banknote is redeemable in gold or silver (at the bearer&#x27;s discretion) at any Federal Reserve Bank.
* 1933: With the U.S. having abandoned the gold standard, the bill is no longer redeemable in gold, but rather in &quot;lawful money&quot;, meaning silver.
* 1942: A special emergency series, with brown serial numbers and &quot;HAWAII&quot; overprinted on both the front and the back, is issued. These notes were designed to circulate on the Hawaiian islands and could be rendered worthless in the event of a Japanese invasion.
* 1948: The White House rendering on the reverse of the bill was updated to reflect renovations to the building itself, including the addition of the Truman Balcony, as well as the passage of time. Most notably, the trees are larger. The change occurred during production of Series 1934C.
* 1950: Design elements such as the treasury and Federal Reserve seals are reduced in size and repositioned subtly, presumably for aesthetic reasons.
* 1963: &quot;Will Pay To The Bearer On Demand&quot; is removed from the front of the bill and the legal tender designation is shortened to &quot;This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private&quot; (eliminating &quot;and is redeemable in lawful money at the United States Treasury, or at any Federal Reserve Bank.&quot;) Also, &quot;In God We Trust&quot; is added above the White House on the reverse. These two acts (one taking U.S. currency off the silver backing, and the other authorizing the national motto) are coincidental, even if their combined result is implemented in one redesign. Also, several design elements are rearranged, less perceptibly than the changes in 1950, mostly to make room for the slightly rearranged obligations.
* 1969: The new treasury seal appears on all denominations, including the $20.
* The old presses are gradually retired, and old-style serial numbers appear as late as 1981 for this denomination.
* Production of Series 1990 bills began in April 1992.
* 1994: The first $20 notes produced at the Western Currency Facility in Fort Worth, Texas are printed in January 1994, late during production of Series 1990.
* 1998: The Series 1996 $20 note was completely redesigned for the first time since 1929 to further deter counterfeiting; A larger, off-center portrait of Jackson was used and the view of the White House on the reverse of the bill was changed from the south portico to the north. Several new anti-counterfeiting features were added, including color-shifting ink, microprinting, and a watermark. The plastic strip now reads &quot;USA 20&quot; and glows green under a black light. Production of Series 1996 $20 notes began in June,1998.
* 2003: The redesigned Series 2004 20 dollar note is released with light background shading in green and yellow, and no oval around Andrew Jackson&#x27;s portrait (background images of eagles, etc. were also added to the obverse); the reverse features the same view of the White House, but without an oval around it. Ninety faint &quot;20&quot;s are scattered on the back in yellow as a &quot;EURion constellation&quot; to prevent photocopying. Production of Series 2004 $20 notes began in April, 2003.

== Proposed redesigns of the 20 dollar bill ==

In a campaign called &quot;Women on 20s&quot;, selected voters were asked to choose three of 15 female candidates to have a portrait on the bill. The goal was to have a woman on the bill by 2020, the centennial of the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote. Among the candidates on the petition were Harriet Tubman, Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, and Wilma Mankiller, the first female chief of the Cherokee Nation.

On May 12, 2015, Tubman was announced as the winning candidate of that &quot;grassroots&quot; poll with more than 600,000 people surveyed and more than 118,000 choosing Tubman, followed by Roosevelt, Parks and Mankiller.

On June 17, 2015, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced that a woman&#x27;s portrait would be featured on a redesigned bill by 2020, replacing Alexander Hamilton. However, that decision was reversed, at least in part due to Hamilton&#x27;s surging popularity following the hit Broadway musical &quot;Hamilton&quot;.

On April 20, 2016, Lew officially announced that Alexander Hamilton would remain on the bill, while Andrew Jackson would be replaced by Tubman on the front of the bill, with Jackson appearing on the reverse. Lew simultaneously announced that the five- and ten-dollar bills would also be redesigned in the coming years and put into production in the next decade.
However, as the $20 was not scheduled to be replaced until after the $10, this moved the production date of the referenced bill containing Tubman back, frustrating supporters of placing a woman on a bill. Secretary Lew reiterated that the $10 would be redesigned first.

===Trump administration===
While campaigning for president, Donald Trump responded to the announcement that Tubman would replace Jackson on the twenty-dollar bill. The day following the announcement Trump called Tubman &quot;fantastic&quot;, but stated that he would oppose replacing Jackson with Tubman, calling the replacement &quot;pure political correctness&quot;, and suggested that Tubman could perhaps be put on another denomination instead.

On August 31, 2017, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he would not commit to putting Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill, explaining &quot;People have been on the bills for a long period of time. This is something we&#x27;ll consider; right now we have a lot more important issues to focus on.&quot; According to a Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) spokesperson, the next redesigned bill will be the ten-dollar bill, not set to be released into circulation until at least 2026.

In May 2019, Mnuchin stated that no new imagery for the new 2028 $20 bill would be unveiled until 2026. He also reaffirmed that the new $20 bill would not be moved up ahead of the new $10 or $50 bills due to counterfeiting security concerns regarding the $10 and $50. Mnuchin would not say whether he supported keeping Tubman on the redesigned $20. He said that the decision will be left to whoever is Treasury secretary in 2026.
Democratic members of the House of Representatives asked Mnuchin to provide more specific reasons for the design release delay. (The production date of new $20, 2028, was unchanged from timeline announced in 2016 by the Obama administration) The Director of the BEP, Len Olijar, released a statement saying that the &quot;BEP was never going to unveil a note design in 2020&quot; and that the illustration used by the New York Times was not a new $20 note. Later in June, the Treasury Department&#x27;s acting inspector general, Rich Delmar, sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer stating that his office would investigate the issue.

In June 2020, the Office of Inspector General released a report detailing the results of its investigation, which concluded that the $20 note&#x27;s position in the redesign sequence had not changed, that the earlier announcement of the 2020 date by the Obama administration &quot;was made outside of the note development governance structure and without the recommendation of the ACD&quot; (referring to the Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence Steering Committee), that the $10 note redesign set to precede the $20 redesign had already been delayed to no earlier than 2026 by 2016, and that the $20 note had not yet entered the banknote design process and was not expected to be production-ready until 2030.

=== Biden administration ===
In January 2021, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki claimed President Joe Biden will accelerate the Tubman redesign. However, a 2022 internal department message from the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, reaffirmed the 2030 debut originally planned by the Trump Administration.

<doc id="477342" wikidata="Q450796" url="?curid=477342" title="Robin Morgan">
<text>Robin Morgan (born January 29, 1941) is an American poet, writer, activist, journalist, lecturer and former child actor. Since the early 1960s, she has been a key radical feminist member of the American Women&#x27;s Movement, and a leader in the international feminist movement. Her 1970 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Powerful&quot; was cited by the New York Public Library as &quot;One of the 100 Most Influential Books of the 20th Century.&quot;. She has written more than 20 books of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, and was editor of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine.

During the 1960s, she participated in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements; in the late 1960s, she was a founding member of radical feminist organizations such as New York Radical Women and W.I.T.C.H. She founded or co-founded the Feminist Women&#x27;s Health Network, the National Battered Women&#x27;s Refuge Network, Media Women, the National Network of Rape Crisis Centers, the Feminist Writers&#x27; Guild, the Women&#x27;s Foreign Policy Council, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, GlobalSister.org, and Greenstone Women&#x27;s Radio Network. She also co-founded the Women&#x27;s Media Center with activist Gloria Steinem and actor/activist Jane Fonda. In 2018, she was listed as one of BBC&#x27;s 100 Women.

==Child actor==

Due to circumstances at her birth, her mother claimed that Robin Morgan was born a year later than she actually was (see birth and parents), and throughout her career as a child actor, she was thought to be a year younger than she actually was, both by herself and others.

Already as a toddler, her mother, Faith, and mother&#x27;s sister Sally started Robin as a child model. At the age of five, believed to be four, she got her own program, titled &quot;Little Robin Morgan&quot;, on the New York radio station WOR. She was also a regular on the original network radio version of &quot;Juvenile Jury&quot;. Her acting career took off when she was eight and started in the TV series &quot;Mama&quot;, as Dagmar Hansen, the younger sister in the family depicted in the series. The show premiered on CBS in 1949, starring Peggy Wood, and was a great success. Morgan played Cecchina Cabrini in &quot;Citizen Saint&quot; (1947).

During the Golden Age of Television, Morgan starred in such &quot;TV spectaculars&quot; as &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, and guest starred on such live dramas as &quot;Omnibus&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Danger&quot;, &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot;, and &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot;. She worked with directors such as Sidney Lumet, John Frankenheimer, Ralph Nelson; writers such as Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling; and performed with actors such as Boris Karloff, Rosalind Russell, Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, and Cliff Robertson.

Having wanted to write rather than to act since she was four, Morgan fought her mother&#x27;s efforts to keep her in show business, and left the cast of &quot;Mama&quot; at age 14.

== Adult life and career ==
As she entered adulthood, Robin Morgan continued her education as a non-matriculating student at Columbia University. She began working as a secretary at Curtis Brown Literary Agency, where she met and worked with such writers as poet W. H. Auden in the early 1960s. She had already begun publishing her own poetry (later collected in her first book of poems, &quot;Monster&quot;, published in 1972). Throughout the next decades, along with political activism, writing fiction and nonfiction prose, and lecturing at colleges and universities on women&#x27;s rights, Morgan continued to write and publish poetry.

In 1962, Morgan married poet Kenneth Pitchford. She gave birth to their son, Blake Morgan, in 1969. The couple divorced in 1983. At that time, she was working as an editor at Grove Press and was involved in an attempt to unionize the publishing industry. When Grove summarily fired her and other union sympathizers, she led a seizure and occupation of their offices in the spring of 1970, protesting the union-busting, as well as the dishonest accounting of royalties to Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X&#x27;s widow. Morgan and eight other women were arrested that day.

In the mid-1970s Morgan became a Contributing Editor to &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine, and continued her affiliation there as a part- or full-time editor in the following decades. She served as editor-in-chief of the magazine from 1989 to 1994, turning it into a highly successful, ad-free, bimonthly, international publication, which won awards for both writing and design, and received considerable acclaim among journalists.

In 1979, when the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed, featuring famous women from politics, media and entertainment, culture, sports, and other areas of achievement, one of the cards featured Morgan&#x27;s name and picture. Today, the trading cards are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the University of Iowa library.

In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit progressive women&#x27;s media organization, The Women’s Media Center, with friends actor/activist Jane Fonda, and activist Gloria Steinem. Seven years later, in 2012, she debuted a weekly radio show and podcast, &quot;Women’s Media Center Live With Robin Morgan.&quot; The broadcast is syndicated in the US and, as a podcast, is published online at the WMCLive website, and distributed on iTunes in 110 countries. It has been praised by &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; as &quot;talk radio with a brain&quot; and features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. The weekly hour was picked up by CBS Radio two weeks after its launch and is broadcast on CBS affiliate WJFK each Saturday. The program features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists.

===Activism===
By 1962 Morgan had become active in the anti-war Left, and had also contributed articles and poetry to such Left-wing and counter-culture journals as &quot;Liberation&quot;, &quot;Rat&quot;, &quot;Win&quot;, and &quot;The National Guardian&quot;.

In the 1960s she became increasingly involved in social-justice movements, notably the civil-rights and anti-Vietnam war. In early 1967, she was active in the Youth International Party (known in the media as the &quot;Yippies&quot;), with Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner. However, tensions over sexism within the YIP (and the New Left in general) came to a head when Morgan grew more involved in Women&#x27;s Liberation and contemporary feminism.

In 1967, Morgan became a founding member of the short-lived New York Radical Women group. She was the key organizer of their September 1968 inaugural protest of the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City. Morgan wrote the Miss America protest pamphlet &quot;No More Miss America!&quot;, and that same year cofounded Women&#x27;s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.), a radical feminist group that used public street theater (called &quot;hexes&quot; or &quot;zaps&quot;) to call attention to sexism. Morgan designed the universal symbol of the women’s movement––the female symbol, a circle with a cross beneath, centered with a raised fist. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; also credits her with first using the term &quot;herstory&quot; in print in her 1970 anthology &quot;Sisterhood is Powerful&quot;. Concerning the feminist organization W.I.T.C.H., Morgan wrote:

:The fluidity and wit of the witches is evident in the ever-changing acronym: the basic, original title was Women&#x27;s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell [...] and the latest heard at this writing is Women Inspired to Commit Herstory.&quot;

With the royalties from her anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Powerful&quot;, Morgan founded the first feminist grant-giving foundation in the US: &quot;The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund&quot;, which provided seed money to many early women&#x27;s groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s. She made a decisive break from what she described as the &quot;male Left&quot; when she led the women&#x27;s takeover of the underground newspaper &quot;Rat&quot; in 1970, and listed the reasons for her break in the first women&#x27;s issue of the paper, in her essay titled &quot;Goodbye to All That&quot;. The essay gained notoriety in the press for naming specific sexist men and institutions in the Left. Decades later, during the Democratic primaries for the 2008 presidential race, Morgan wrote a fiery sequel to her original essay, titled &quot;Goodbye To All That #2&quot;, in defense of Hillary Clinton. The article quickly went viral on the internet for lambasting sexist rhetoric directed towards Clinton by the media.

In 1977, Morgan became an associate of the Women&#x27;s Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

Morgan has traveled extensively across the United States and around the world to bring attention to cross-cultural sexism. She has met with and interviewed female rebel fighters in the Philippines, Brazilian women activists in the slums/favelas of Rio, women organizers in the townships of South Africa, and underground feminists in Iran. Twice––in 1986 and 1989 she spent months in the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, West Bank, and Gaza, to report on the conditions of women. Morgan has also spoken at universities and institutions in countries across Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America, as well as in Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa.

Over the years, Morgan has received numerous awards for her activism on women’s rights. The Feminist Majority Foundation named Robin Morgan &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; in 1990; she received the Warrior Woman Award for Promoting Racial Understanding from The Asian American Women&#x27;s National Organization in 1992; in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now, and in 2003 The Feminist Press gave her a &quot;Femmy&quot; Award for her &quot;service to literature&quot;. She has also received the Humanist Heroine Award from The American Humanist Association in 2007.

;Limbaugh FCC incident
In March 2012 Morgan, along with her Women&#x27;s Media Center co-founders Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem, wrote an open letter asking listeners to request that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) investigate the Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy, where Rush Limbaugh referred to Sandra Fluke as a &quot;slut&quot; and &quot;prostitute&quot; after she advocated for insurance coverage for contraception. They asked that stations licensed for public airwaves carrying Limbaugh be held accountable for contravening public interest as a continual promoter of hate speech against various disempowered and minority groups.

===Sisterhood anthologies===

In 1970, Morgan compiled, edited, and introduced the first anthology of feminist writings, &quot;Sisterhood is Powerful&quot;. The compilation included now-classic feminist essays by such activists as Naomi Weisstein, Kate Millett, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Florynce Kennedy, Frances M. Beal, Joreen, Marge Piercy, Lucinda Cisler and Mary Daly, as well as historical documents including the N.O.W. Bill of Rights, excerpts from the SCUM Manifesto, the Redstockings Manifesto, historical documents from W.I.T.C.H., and a germinal statement from the Black Women’s Liberation Group of Mount Vernon. It also included what Morgan called &quot;verbal karate&quot;: useful quotes and statistics about women. The anthology was cited by the New York Public Library as one of the “New York Public Library&#x27;s Books of the [20th] Century”. Morgan established the first American feminist grant-giving organization, The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, with the royalties from &quot;Sisterhood Is Powerful&quot;. However, the anthology was banned in Chile, China, and South Africa.

Her follow-up volume in 1984, &quot;Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women&#x27;s Movement Anthology&quot;, compiled articles about women in over seventy countries. That same year she founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, notable for being the first international feminist think tank. Repeatedly refusing the post of president, she was elected secretary of the organization from 1989 to 1993, was VP from 1993 to 1997, and after serving on the advisory board, finally agreed to become president in 2004. A third volume, &quot;Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women&#x27;s Anthology for a New Millennium&quot; in 2003, was a collection of articles mostly by well-known feminists, both young and &quot;vintage&quot;, in a retrospective on and future blueprint for the feminist movement. It was compiled, edited, and with an introduction by Morgan, and Morgan wrote &quot;To Vintage Feminists&quot; and &quot;To Younger Women&quot;, which were both included in the anthology as Personal Postscripts.

===Journalism===
Morgan&#x27;s articles, essays, reviews, interviews, political analyses, and investigative journalism have appeared widely in such publications as &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Broadsheet&quot;, &quot;Chrysalis&quot;, &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;Everywoman&quot;, &quot;The Feminist Art Journal&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; (US), &quot;The Guardian&quot; (UK), &quot;The Hudson Review&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Ms.&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Off Our Backs&quot;, &quot;Pacific Ways&quot;, &quot;The Second Wave&quot;, &quot;Sojourner&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;The Voice of Women&quot;, and various United Nations periodicals, etc. 

Articles and essays have also appeared in reprint in international media, in English across the Commonwealth, and in translation in 13 languages in Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia.

Morgan has served as a contributing editor to &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine for many years, receiving the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism for her cover story titled &quot;The First Feminist Exiles from the USSR&quot; in 1981. She served as the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, re-launching it as an ad-free, international bimonthly publication in 1991. This earned her a series of awards, including the award for Editorial Excellence by &quot;Utne Reader&quot; in 1991, and the Exceptional Merit in Journalism Award by the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus. Morgan resigned her post in 1994 to become Consulting Global Editor of the magazine, which she remains to this day.

Morgan has written for online audiences and blogged frequently. Among her best known articles are &quot;Letters from Ground Zero&quot; (written and posted after the September 11 attacks in 2001 — which went viral), &quot;Goodbye To All That #2&quot;, &quot;Women of the Arab Spring&quot;, &quot;When Bad News is Good News: Notes of a Feminist News Junkie&quot;, &quot;Manhood and Moral Waivers&quot;, and &quot;Faith Healing: A Modest Proposal on Religious Fundamentalism&quot;. Her online work is hosted in the archives of the Women&#x27;s Media Center.

===Authorship===

Robin Morgan has published 21 books, including works of poetry, fiction, and the now-classic anthologies &quot;Sisterhood Is Powerful,&quot; &quot;Sisterhood Is Global&quot;, and &quot;Sisterhood Is Forever&quot;. Well before she was known as a feminist leader, literary magazines published her as a serious poet. According to a 1972 review of her first book of poems, &quot;Monster&quot;, in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;[These poems] establish Morgan as a poet of considerable means. There is a savage elegance, a richness of vocabulary, a thrust and steely polish... A powerful, challenging book.&quot; In 1979 Morgan received a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in poetry, then held a writing residency at the arts colony Yaddo the following year. During this time she worked on a cycle of verse plays.

Morgan’s poetry collections include &quot;A Hot January: Poems 1996–1999&quot; (W. W. Norton, 1999), &quot;Depth Perception: New Poems and a Masque&quot; (Doubleday, 1994), &quot;Upstairs in the Garden: Poems Selected and New 1968–1988&quot; (W. W. Norton, 1990), &quot;Death Benefits&quot; (Copper Canyon Press, 1981), &quot;Lady of the Beasts&quot; (Random House, 1976), and &quot;Monster&quot; (Random House, 1972). Of the book A &quot;Hot January&quot;, Alice Walker wrote: &quot;Morgan proves that exquisite poetry can be the most surprising gift of grief. A volume as proud, fierce, vulnerable, and brave as the poet herself.&quot; A review of &quot;Upstairs in the Garden&quot;, noted: &quot;As a vindication and celebration of the female experience, these inventive poems successfully wed feminist rhetoric with vivid imagery and sensitivity to the music of language.&quot; Two books of poems, &quot;Lady of the Beasts&quot; and &quot;Depth Perception&quot;, earned reviews in &quot;Poetry Magazine&quot; with critic Jay Parini stating that &quot;Robin Morgan will soon be regarded as one of our first-ranking poets.&quot;

Morgan had published three books of fiction as of 2015. Her debut novel was the semi-autobiographical &quot;Dry Your Smile&quot; (published by Doubleday &amp; Company, 1987), followed by &quot;The Mer-Child: A Legend for Children and Other Adults&quot; (published by The Feminist Press at City University of New York, 1991). Her most recent work of fiction is a historical novel titled &quot;The Burning Time&quot; (Melville House Books, 2006), set in the 14th century, based on court records of the first witchcraft trial in Ireland. &quot;The Burning Time&quot; was placed on the Recommended Quality Fiction List of 2007 by the American Library Association, in addition to being the 2006 Paperback Pick by Book Sense (The American Booksellers Association).

Morgan has compiled, edited, and introduced several influential anthologies: &quot;Sisterhood Is Powerful: The Women’s Liberation Anthology&quot; (1970), &quot;Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women’s Movement Anthology&quot; (1984), and &quot;Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women’s Anthology for a New Millennium&quot; (2003). She has herself written non-fiction, including &quot;Going Too Far&quot; (1978), &quot;The Anatomy of Freedom&quot; (1984), &quot;The Demon Lover: On the Sexuality of Terrorism&quot; (1989), &quot;The Word of a Woman&quot; (1994), and &quot;Saturday’s Child: A Memoir&quot; (2001). One of the most widely translated of Morgan’s books and a best-seller, &quot;The Demon Lover&quot; is a commentary on the psychological and political roots of terrorism, and &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; called it &quot;Important...compelling...[Morgan] is intense and at times magnificent.&quot; Her most recently published book of non-fiction is &quot;Fighting Words: A Tool Kit for Combating the Religious Right&quot; (2006).

===Organizations===

====The Sisterhood Is Global Institute====
In 1984, Morgan, together with the late Simone de Beauvoir of France, and women from 80 other countries, founded The Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI), an international non-profit NGO with consultative status to the United Nations, which has for three decades functioned as the world’s first feminist think-tank. The Institute has played a leading policy-formulation, strategic, and activist role in the evolution of the international Women’s Movement. SIGI has also developed a global communications network through which an umbrella of NGO interest, advice, contacts, and support is collectively mobilized to empower the global women’s movement.

Among its many activities, the Institute pioneered the first Urgent Acton Alerts regarding women’s rights; the first Global Campaign To Make Visible Women’s Unpaid Labor In National Accounts; and the first Women’s Rights Manuals For Muslim Societies (in 12 languages). Its most recent project is Donor Direct Action (donordirectaction.org), which links front-line women’s rights activists around the world to money, visibility, and popular support: minimum bureaucracy, maximum impact.

====Women’s Media Center====
In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit progressive organization, The Women’s Media Center with her friends actor/activist Jane Fonda, and activist Gloria Steinem. The focus of the organization is to make women powerful and visible in the media.

===Lectures and professorships===
An invited speaker at numerous universities in North America, Morgan has traveled—as organizer, speaker, journalist—across North America, Europe, and the Middle East to Australia, Brazil, the Caribbean, Central America, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. She has also been a guest professor or scholar in residence at a variety of academic institutions. She was guest chair for feminist studies at the New College of Florida in 1971; a visiting professor at The Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture at Rutgers University in 1987; a distinguished visiting scholar in residence for literary and cultural studies at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand in 1989; a visiting professor in residence at the University of Denver, Colorado in 1996; and visiting professor at the Center for Documentation on Women at University of Bologna, Italy, in 1996. She was awarded an honorary degree as a Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs in 1992. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection that documents the personal, political, and professional aspects of Morgan&#x27;s life, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women’s History and Culture at Duke University. They date from the 1940s to the present.

==Criticism==
Robin Morgan has been arrested, and has received death threats from both the Right and the Left because of her activism. According to a &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine article published in the aftermath of Morgan&#x27;s essay &quot;Goodbye to All That&quot; (#2) going viral on the Internet, &quot;At five feet tall Morgan is, not for the first time, the little woman who has started a big war.&quot; In her original essay, &quot;Goodbye to All That&quot; (1970), Morgan bade adieu to &quot;the dream that being in the leadership collective will get you anything but gonorrhea,&quot; referring to the &quot;male Left&quot;. She also asserted that Charles Manson was &quot;only the logical extreme of the normal American male’s fantasy.&quot;

Two years later, Morgan published the poem &quot;Arraignment&quot;, in which she openly accused Ted Hughes of the battery and murder of Sylvia Plath. There were lawsuits, Morgan&#x27;s 1972 book &quot;Monster&quot; which contained that poem was banned, and underground, pirated feminist editions of it were published.

As the leading organizer of the 1968 protest of the Miss America Pageant, &quot;No More Miss America!&quot;, Morgan attacked the pageant’s &quot;ludicrous &#x27;beauty&#x27; standards and also accused the pageant of being racist, since at that time no African American woman had been a contestant. In addition––according to Morgan––in sending pageant winners to entertain troops in Vietnam, the women served as &quot;death mascots&quot; in an immoral war. Morgan asked, &quot;Where else could one find such a perfect combination of American values -- racism, militarism, capitalism -- all packaged in one &#x27;ideal&#x27; symbol, a woman.&quot;

Another controversial quote is from her 1978 book, Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist, where she stated: &quot;I feel that &quot;man-hating&quot; is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.&quot;

Morgan famously walked off &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 1969 when it screened vintage footage of her as a child actor while she was trying to speak seriously about the first national march against rape. Of the incident, she has been quoted as saying: &quot;Imagine talking about such a subject and having it trivialized like that.&quot; In 1974, with her phrase &quot;Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice&quot; (from her essay &quot;Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape&quot;), she became a central figure on one of the divisive issues in feminism, particularly among anti-pornography feminists in Anglophone countries.

In 1973, Robin Morgan gave the keynote speech at the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in which she criticized Beth Elliott, a performer and organizer of the conference, for being a transgender woman. In this speech she referred to Elliott as a &quot;transsexual male&quot; and used male pronouns throughout, charging her with being &quot;an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer-with the mentality of a rapist.&quot; At the end of her speech she called for a vote on ejecting Elliott, with over two-thirds voting to allow her to remain, however the minority threatened to disrupt the conference and Elliott chose to leave after her performance to avoid this. The event demonstrated the high tension surrounding transgender women&#x27;s involvement in the women&#x27;s movement of the 1970s.

==Personal life==
Robin Morgan grew up in New York, first in Mount Vernon, and later in Manhattan, on Sutton Place. She graduated from The Wetter School in Mount Vernon, in 1956, and was privately tutored from then until 1959. She published her first serious poetry in literary magazines at age 17.

In an article published in the Jewish Women&#x27;s Archive, Morgan reveals she is of Jewish ancestry, but identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She is quoted as saying, &quot;When compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms—I have described myself as being European American of Ashkenazic (with a touch of Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I’m quite proud of mine, I feel they’re just not particularly central to my identity. I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.&quot; Morgan continues to tackle topics such as religion, politics and sex in fiery commentaries on her radio show &quot;WMC Live with Robin Morgan&quot;.

Today Robin Morgan lives in Manhattan. Blake Morgan, her son with ex-husband Kenneth Pitchford, is a musician, recording artist, and founder of New York-based record company ECR Music Group.

In 2000 Norton published Morgan’s memoir, &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Child&quot;, in which she wrote candidly about &quot;the shadowy circumstances of her birth; a lifelong, impassioned, love-hate relationship with her mother; her years as a famous child actor and her fight to escape show business to become a serious writer; her marriage to a fiery bisexual poet and how motherhood transformed her life; her years in the civil rights movement, the New Left, and counterculture; her emergence a leader of global feminism; and her love affairs with women as well as men,&quot; according to &quot;BookNews.com&quot;. In her book, &quot;her passion for writing, especially poetry, is vividly conveyed, as is her love and respect for her son, born in 1969,&quot; according to &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;.

In April 2013, Morgan announced publicly that she had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, discussing the diagnosis on her radio show &quot;WMC Live with Robin Morgan&quot;, revealing that she had been diagnosed in 2010, but that her quality of life was thus far &quot;normal&quot;. Since her diagnosis, Morgan has become active with the Parkinson&#x27;s Disease Foundation (PDF), completing training to become part of the organization&#x27;s Parkinson&#x27;s Advocates in Research initiative. In 2014 she was the catalyst and took a leadership role in PDF&#x27;s new Women and PD initiative, which will seek to better serve women impacted by Parkinson&#x27;s disease by understanding and resolving gender inequalities in PD research, treatment, and caregiver support. Morgan has also written new poetry inspired by her battle with the disease, and performed a reading of some of the poems as a TED Talk, at the TEDWomen 2015 conference.

===Birth and parents===
Her mother, Faith Berkeley Morgan, traveled from her New York residence to Florida to give birth, in order to avoid public scrutiny for her unmarried status. Robin&#x27;s father, a medical doctor named Mates Morgenstern, did not accompany pregnant Faith on her trip.

Until Morgan was 13 years old, her mother Faith claimed that Robin&#x27;s father had been killed in World War II. However, Robin overheard conversations between her mother and aunt suggesting her father was alive. When she confronted her mother, Faith changed her story to assert that Robin&#x27;s father had escaped from one Nazi concentration camp after another, and that she had saved his life by sponsoring his immigration to the United States where he had no family. Not until several years later did Robin get proof that this was also a lie.

Morgan learned the truth, both about her father, who was still alive, and how old she really was, early in 1961. Now a young woman, no longer working in show business, Robin found a listing for the medical practice of an obstetrician, Dr. Mates Morgenstern, in the New Brunswick, New Jersey telephone directory. Suspecting this might be her father, she had sought a meeting with him, without her mother&#x27;s knowledge, and ultimately paid a surprise visit to his New Jersey office in January 1961.

Morgenstern revealed that he was aware of Robin&#x27;s fame as a child actor, but had remained firm in his decision to avoid contact with Faith Morgan, having chosen not to see her again after the only time he visited her and the infant Robin. He also told Robin, during their conversation in his medical office, that she in fact was born on January 29, 1941, exactly one year earlier than she thought, and disclosed the copy of her original birth certificate, that he had stored in his office. In order to conceal the out-of-wedlock birth, Faith Morgan had asked her Florida obstetrician to sign an affidavit stating that the birth took place on January 29, 1942.

During the conversation in his office, Morgenstern told his daughter that he first met her mother after his arrival in the United States, more than a year before the United States entered World War II, and that she had had nothing to do with his immigration. He added that he had known Faith only briefly and claimed that she had fantasized their relationship as more important than it was. By the time Morgan met her father he had married and had two sons with a woman he had known since they were both children in Austria. Having been separated by the war, they resumed their relationship after she arrived in the United States not long after Robin was born, which probably also added to Morgenstern&#x27;s decision to abandon Faith and their daughter.

Morgan only met her father once more, in February 1965 when he invited her and her husband to his New Jersey home. Morgenstern did not want his sons to know that they had a half-sister and Morgan acceded to his request that they tell his two sons that she was &quot;the daughter of an old friend.&quot; She refused to do so again, however, and never met him or her two half-brothers again.

Morgan describes the two encounters that she had with her biological father in her autobiography, &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Child: A Memoir&quot;.

When Faith Morgan developed Parkinson&#x27;s disease, in her early 60s, Robin telephoned her biological father to let him know. When she asked if he wanted to say goodbye, he declined. During Faith&#x27;s illness, her life savings, which consisted of the money Robin had earned in her radio and television career – by then a six-figure sum that had accumulated in the bank – was stolen, by her two elderly home caregivers. Morgan discovered this but ultimately chose not to press charges.

<text>The United States fifty-dollar bill (US$50) is a denomination of United States currency. The 18th U.S. president (1869-1877), Ulysses S. Grant, is featured on the obverse, while the U.S. Capitol is featured on the reverse. All current-issue $50 bills are Federal Reserve Notes.

As of December 2018, the average life of a $50 bill in circulation is 12.2 years before it is replaced due to wear. Approximately 3.5% of all notes printed in 2019 were $50 bills. They are delivered by Federal Reserve Banks in beige straps. Next to the United States two-dollar bill, the fifty-dollar bill has the lowest circulation of any U.S. denomination measured by volume, with 1.8 billion notes in circulation as of December 31, 2019.

==History==

===Large size notes===

&quot;( 7.4218 × 3.125 in ≅ 189 × 79 mm)&quot;

*1861: Three-year $50 Interest Bearing Notes were issued that paid a cent of interest per day, and thus 7.3% annually — the so-called seven-thirties. These notes were not primarily designed to circulate and were payable to the original purchaser of the dollar bill. The obverse of the note featured a bald eagle.
*1862: The first circulating $50 bill was issued.
*1863: Both one and two-year Interest Bearing Notes were issued that paid 5% interest. The one-year Interest Bearing Notes featured a vignette of Alexander Hamilton to the left and an allegorical figure representing loyalty to the right. The two-year notes featured allegorical figures of loyalty and justice.
* 1864: Compound Interest Treasury Notes were issued, intended to circulate for three years and paying 6% interest compounded semi-annually. The obverse is similar to the &quot;Series of 1863&quot; one-year Interest Bearing Note.
*1865: Three-year Interest Bearing Notes were issued again with a slightly different bald eagle and border design on the obverse.
*1869: A new $50 United States Note was issued with a portrait of Henry Clay on the right and an allegorical figure holding a laurel branch on the left of the obverse.
* 1870: $50 National Gold Bank Notes were issued specifically for payment in gold coin by 2 national gold banks. The obverse featured vignettes of George Washington crossing the Delaware River and at Valley Forge; the reverse featured a vignette of U.S. gold coins.
*1874: Another new $50 United States Note was issued with a portrait of Benjamin Franklin on the left and allegorical figure of the goddess of Liberty on the right of the obverse.
*1878: The first $50 silver certificate was issued with a portrait of Edward Everett. The reverse was printed in black ink.
*1880: The &quot;Series of 1878&quot; Silver Certificate was slightly revised.
*1882: The first $50 gold certificate with a portrait of Silas Wright was issued. The reverse was printed in orange ink and featured a bald eagle perched atop an American flag.
*1891: The obverse of the $50 Silver Certificate was slightly revised and the reverse was completely changed.
*1891: The $50 Treasury or &quot;Coin Note&quot; was issued and given for government purchases of silver bullion from the silver mining industry. The note featured a portrait of William H. Seward.
*1913: A new $50 gold certificate with a portrait of Ulysses Grant was issued. The style of the area below Grant&#x27;s portrait was later used on small-sized notes.
*1914: The first $50 Federal Reserve Note was issued with a portrait of Ulysses Grant on the obverse and an allegorical figure of Panama between a merchant and battle ship on the reverse.
*1918: Federal Reserve Bank Notes (&quot;not to be confused with Federal Reserve Notes&quot;) were issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The obverse was similar to the 1914 Federal Reserve Notes, except for large wording in the center of the note and a borderless portrait on the left side. The note was an obligation of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank and could only be redeemed there.
*1922: last $50 large size note was issued, a Gold Certificate. Reverse identical to 1913 issue; obverse has modified text.

===Small size notes===
&quot;(6.14 × 2.61 in ≅ 156 × 66 mm)&quot;

*1928: Under the &quot;Series of 1928&quot;, all U.S. currency was changed to its current size. All variations of the $50 bill would carry the same portrait of Ulysses S. Grant, same border design on the obverse, and the same reverse with a vignette of the U.S. Capitol showing the east front. The $50 bill was issued as a Federal Reserve Note with a green seal and serial numbers and as a gold certificate with a golden seal and serial numbers.
*1933: As an emergency response to the Great Depression, additional money was pumped into the American economy through Federal Reserve Bank Notes issued under &quot;Series of 1929&quot;. This was the only small-sized $50 bill that had a different border design on the obverse. The serial numbers and seal were brown.
*1934: The redeemable in gold clause was removed from Federal Reserve Notes due to the U.S. withdrawing from the gold standard.
*1950: Many minor aspects on the obverse of the $50 Federal Reserve Note were changed. Most noticeably, the treasury seal, gray word , and the Federal Reserve Seal were made smaller; also, the Federal Reserve seal had spikes added around the perimeter, like the Treasury seal.
*1966: was removed from the obverse and was added to the reverse of the $50 Federal Reserve Note beginning with &quot;Series 1963A&quot;. Also, the obligation was shortened to its current wording, .
*1969: The $50 bill began using the new treasury seal with wording in English instead of Latin.
*1991: The first new-age anti-counterfeiting measures were introduced under &quot;Series 1990&quot; with microscopic printing around Grant&#x27;s portrait and a plastic security strip on the left side of the bill. The first Series 1990 notes were printed in November, 1991.
*October 27, 1997: The first major redesign of the $50 note since 1929 was implemented as &quot;Series 1996&quot; to further deter counterfeiters. Included were an enlarged and off-center portrait of Grant, an enlarged and updated view of the U.S. Capitol now showing the west front on the reverse, a security thread which glows yellow under ultraviolet light, a numeric &quot;50&quot; which shifts color from black to green when tilted, and a watermark of Grant. Also, for those with vision limitations, a large dark &quot;50&quot; was added to the bottom right corner of the reverse. The Federal Reserve seal with the district letter was changed to a unified Federal Reserve System seal and an additional prefix letter was added to the beginning of the bill&#x27;s serial number. These redesigned $50 notes were first printed in July, 1997.
*September 28, 2004: A revised design of the $50 note was implemented, as &quot;Series 2004&quot;, with the first use of multiple colors since the 1905 $20 gold certificate. Around the new borderless portrait of President Grant appears a subtle, stylized blue and red background image of the American Flag. A small silver-blue star was also added to the lower right of Grant&#x27;s portrait. All previous &quot;Series 1996&quot; security features were included, although the color-shifting numeric 50 now shifts from copper to green. The oval border and fine lines surrounding the U.S. Capitol on the reverse have been removed and replaced with sky and clouds. The new design also seems to have the &quot;EURion constellation&quot; on the back to prevent photocopying of the bill. The 2004 bills have the signature combination of Marin-Snow. The first printing of these redesigned $50 notes was in March, 2004. This marked the first notes printed at the Western Currency Facility in Fort Worth, Texas; all $50 notes have been printed there since.

===Series dates===

====Small size====

== Proposed redesign ==
In 2005, a proposal to put Ronald Reagan&#x27;s portrait on the $50 bill was put forward, but never went beyond the House Financial Services Committee, even though Republicans controlled the House. In 2010, North Carolina Republican Patrick McHenry introduced another bill to put Reagan&#x27;s portrait on the $50 bill.

<text>Chaiya (, ) is a former capital district (&quot;Amphoe mueang&quot;) of Surat Thani province, Southern Thailand. The main town is Talat Chaiya.

==Geography==
Neighboring districts are (from the south clockwise): Tha Chang and Kapoe of Ranong province; Phato of Chumphon province, and Tha Chana in Surat Thani. To the east is the Gulf of Thailand, with Cape Sui marking the northern end of the Bandon Bay.

The eastern part of the district consists of mostly flat low coastal areas, while to the west are the mountains of the Phuket mountain range, including Kaeng Krung National Park.

==History==

Laem Pho Beach in the district is thought to have been a Srivijaya Kingdom seaport in the 7th to 13th centuries. Srivijaya was a Malay city-state that grew to become an influential maritime power in what is now Southeast Asia. Tang dynasty (7th–10th centuries) ceramics have been found in the area as well as pottery from India and glassware from Persia. Similar finds have been made in Ban Thung Tuek, Takua Pa district, Phang Nga province on the other side of the isthmus, 200 km distant, indicating that there may have been an overland route connecting the Gulf of Thailand with the Andaman Seacoast. This route would have enabled traders to avoid piracy in the narrow Strait of Malacca. 
The name &quot;Chaiya&quot; might be derived from its original Malay name &quot;cahaya&quot;, meaning &#x27;light&#x27;, &#x27;gleam&#x27;, or &#x27;glow&#x27;. Some scholars identify Chai-ya as coming from Sri-vi- &quot;ja-ya&quot;.

Wat Phra Borommathat is centered on a reconstructed stupa in Srivijaya-style. The nearby branch of the National Museum has several relics of that time on display. Two more former stupas nearby are now only brick mounds.

Inscription 23, as it was labeled by Prince Damrong in his &quot;Collected Inscriptions of Siam&quot;, is now attributed to Wat Hua Wiang in Chaiya. Dated to the year 697 of the Mahasakkarat era (i.e., 775 CE), the inscription on a Bai Sema shaped stone tells about the King of Srivijaya having erected three stupas at that site and possibly the one at Wat Phra Borom That.

Another important temple near Chaiya is Wat Suan Mohkha Phalaram (also known by the short name Suan Mok, or Wat Than Nam Lai &#x27;Monastery of Flowing Water&#x27;), a forest temple. The temple was founded in 1932 by Phra Buddhadasa (19061993), a revered Buddhist teacher. In 1959 the temple was relocated to the present site. These temples are believed to have been used to store rice in large quantities, due to the invading Japanese. These large Buddhist rice temples are rare in the region and only one has been officially labeled as a rice storage temple.

Although, the capital district (&quot;Amphoe mueang&quot;) of Surat Thani province is Bandon district, the local Surat Thani people generally refer to this district as the capital district and refer to Bandon district as little China of the province.

==Transport==
Chaiya is on the southern railway line, Chaiya Railway Station is the main railway station of the district. Asian highway AH2 (Thailand Route 41) also passes the city.

==Administration==
Chaiya district is divided into nine sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;). These are further divided into 54 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;). There are three sub-district municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambons&quot;): Talat Chaiya includes most of &quot;tambon&quot; Talat Chaiya and parts of Lamet; Phumriang the entire &quot;tambon&quot; Phumriang; Wiang the entire &quot;tambon&quot; of Wiang. The other six sub-districts each have a tambon administrative organization as their local government.

<text>The United States one-hundred-dollar bill (US$100) is a denomination of United States currency. The first United States Note with this value was issued in 1862 and the Federal Reserve Note version was first produced in 1914. Inventor and U.S. Founding Father Benjamin Franklin has been featured on the obverse of the bill since 1914, which now also contains stylized images of the Declaration of Independence, a quill pen, the Syng inkwell, and the Liberty Bell. The reverse depicts Independence Hall in Philadelphia, which it has featured since 1928. 

The bill is the largest denomination that has been printed and circulated since July 13, 1969, when the larger denominations of , , , and were retired. the average life of a bill in circulation is 22.9 years before it is replaced due to wear.

The bills are also commonly referred to as &quot;Bens&quot;, &quot;Benjamins&quot;, or &quot;Franklins&quot;, in reference to the use of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s portrait by the French painter Joseph Duplessis on the denomination, as &quot;C-Notes&quot; or &quot;Century Notes&quot;, based on the Roman numeral for 100, or as &quot;blue faces&quot;, based on the blue tint of Franklin&#x27;s face in the current design. The bill is one of two denominations printed today that does not feature a president of the United States, the other being the $10 bill, featuring Alexander Hamilton. The &quot;Series 2009&quot; bill redesign was unveiled on April 21, 2010, and was issued to the public on October 8, 2013. The new bill costs 12.6 cents to produce and has a blue ribbon woven into the center of the currency with &quot;100&quot; and Liberty Bells, alternating, that appear when the bill is tilted.

As of June 30, 2012, the bill comprised 77% of all US currency in circulation. Federal Reserve data from 2017 showed that the number of bills exceeded the number of bills. However, a 2018 research paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago estimated that 80 percent of bills were in other countries. Possible reasons included $100 bills being used as a reserve currency against economic instability that affected other currencies, and use of the bills for criminal activities.

==History==

===Large size notes===
&quot;( 7.4218 × 3.125 in ≈ 189 × 79 mm)&quot;

* 1861: Three-year 100-dollar Interest Bearing Notes were issued that paid 7.3% interest per year. These notes were not primarily designed to circulate and were payable to the original purchaser of the dollar bill. The obverse of the note featured a portrait of General Winfield Scott.
* 1862: The first United States Note was issued. Variations of this note were issued that resulted in slightly different wording (obligations) on the reverse; the note was issued again in &quot;Series of 1863&quot;.
* 1863: Both one and two and one half year Interest Bearing Notes were issued that paid 5% interest. The one-year Interest Bearing Notes featured a vignette of George Washington in the center, and allegorical figures representing &quot;The Guardian&quot; to the right and &quot;Justice&quot; to the left. The two-year notes featured a vignette of the U.S. treasury building in the center, a farmer and mechanic to the left, and sailors firing a cannon to the right.
* 1863: The first Gold Certificates were issued with a bald eagle to the left and large green 100 in the middle of the obverse. The reverse was distinctly printed in orange instead of green like all other U.S. federal government issued notes of the time.
* 1864: Compound Interest Treasury Notes were issued that were intended to circulate for three years and paid 6% interest compounded semi-annually. The obverse is similar to the 1863 one-year Interest Bearing Note.
* 1869: A new United States Note was issued with a portrait of Abraham Lincoln on the left of the obverse and an allegorical figure representing architecture on the right. Although this note is technically a United States Note, appeared on it instead of .
* 1870: A new Gold Certificate with a portrait of Thomas Hart Benton on the left side of the obverse was issued. The note was one-sided.
* 1870: One hundred dollar National Gold Bank Notes were issued specifically for payment in gold coin by participating national gold banks. The obverse featured vignettes of Perry leaving the USS St. Lawrence and an allegorical figure to the right; the reverse featured a vignette of U.S. gold coins.
* 1875: The reverse of the &quot;Series of 1869&quot; United States Note was redesigned. Also, was changed to on the obverse. This note was issued again in &quot;Series of 1878&quot; and &quot;Series of 1880&quot;.
* 1878: The first silver certificate was issued with a portrait of James Monroe on the left side of the obverse. The reverse was printed in black ink, unlike any other U.S. Federal Government issued bill.
* 1882: A new and revised Gold Certificate was issued. The obverse was partially the same as the &quot;Series 1870&quot; gold certificate; the border design, portrait of Thomas H. Benton, and large word , and gold-colored ink behind the serial numbers were all retained. The reverse featured a perched bald eagle and the Roman numeral for 100, C.
* 1890: One hundred dollar Treasury or &quot;Coin Notes&quot; were issued for government purchases of silver bullion from the silver mining industry. The note featured a portrait of Admiral David G. Farragut. The note was also nicknamed a &quot;watermelon note&quot; because of the watermelon-shaped 0&#x27;s in the large numeral 100 on the reverse; the large numeral 100 was surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note.
* 1891: The reverse of the &quot;Series of 1890&quot; Treasury Note was redesigned because the Treasury felt that it was too &quot;busy&quot; which would make it too easy to counterfeit. More open space was incorporated into the new design.
* 1891: The obverse of the Silver Certificate was slightly revised with some aspects of the design changed. The reverse was completely redesigned and also began to be printed in green ink.
* 1902: An extremely rare National Banknote was issued. It had a blue seal, and John J. Knox on the obverse, and two men and an eagle on top of a shield on the reverse.
* 1914: The first Federal Reserve Note was issued with a portrait of Benjamin Franklin on the obverse and allegorical figures representing labor, plenty, America, peace, and commerce on the reverse.
* 1922: The &quot;Series of 1880&quot; Gold Certificate was re-issued with an obligation to the right of the bottom-left serial number on the obverse.

===Small size notes===
&quot;(6.14 × 2.61 in ≅ 156 × 66 mm)&quot;

* 1929: Under the &quot;Series of 1928&quot;, all U.S. currency was changed to its current size and began to carry a standardized design. All variations of the bill would carry the same portrait of Benjamin Franklin, same border design on the obverse, and the same reverse with a vignette of Independence Hall. The bill was issued as a Federal Reserve Note with a green seal and serial numbers and as a Gold Certificate with a golden seal and serial numbers.
* 1933: As an emergency response to the Great Depression, additional money was pumped into the American economy through Federal Reserve Bank Notes issued under &quot;Series of 1929&quot;. This was the only small-sized bill that had a slightly different border design on the obverse. The serial numbers and seal on it were brown.
* 1934: The &quot;redeemable in gold&quot; clause was removed from Federal Reserve Notes due to the U.S. withdrawing from the gold standard.
* 1934: Special Gold Certificates were issued for non-public, Federal Reserve bank-to-bank transactions. These notes featured a reverse printed in orange instead of green like all other small-sized notes. The wording on the obverse was also changed to .
* 1950: Many minor aspects on the obverse of the Federal Reserve Note were changed. Most noticeably, the treasury seal, gray numeral &#x27;100&#x27;, and the Federal Reserve Seal were now smaller with small &quot;spikes&quot; added around the Federal Reserve seal, like the Treasury seal.
* 1963: Because dollar bills were no longer redeemable in silver, beginning with &quot;Series 1963A&quot;, was removed from the obverse of the Federal Reserve Note and the obligation was shortened to its current wording, . Also,  was added to the reverse.
* 1966: The first and only small-sized United States Note was issued with a red seal and serial numbers. It was the first of all United States currency to use the new U.S. treasury seal with wording in English instead of Latin. Like the &quot;Series 1963&quot; and United States Notes, it lacked on the obverse and featured the motto on the reverse. The United States Note was issued due to legislation that specified a certain dollar amount of United States Notes that were to remain in circulation. Because the and United States Notes were soon to be discontinued, the dollar amount of United States Notes would drop, thus warranting the issuing of this note. United States Notes were last printed in 1969 and last issued in 1971.
* 1990: The first new-age anti-counterfeiting measures were introduced under &quot;Series 1990&quot; with microscopic printing around Franklin&#x27;s portrait and a metallic security strip on the left side of the bill.
* March 25, 1996: The first major design change of the note since 1929 took place with the adoption of a contemporary style layout. The main intent of the new design was to deter counterfeiting, which had become more rampant following the rise of computer printing and image scanning technology. New security features included a watermark of Franklin to the right side of the bill, optically variable ink (OVI) that changed from green to black when viewed at different angles on the lower right corner &#x27;100&#x27;, an enlarged and different portrait of Franklin, and hard-to-reproduce fine line printing around Franklin&#x27;s portrait and Independence Hall. Older security features such as interwoven red and blue silk fibers, microprinting, and a plastic security thread (which now glows pink [nominally red] under a black light) were kept. The individual Federal Reserve Bank Seal with district letter was changed to a unified Federal Reserve System Seal along with an additional prefix letter being added to the serial number, w. The first of the Series 1996 bills were produced in October 1995.
* February 2007: The first bills (a shipment of 128,000 star notes from the San Francisco FRB) from the Western Currency Facility in Fort Worth, Texas are produced, almost 16 years after the first notes from the facility were produced. The shipment makes the bill the most recently added production to the facility&#x27;s lineup. 4.6 billion notes were produced at the facility with series 2006 and Cabral and Paulson signatures, including about 4.15 million star notes.
* October 8, 2013: The newest bill was announced on April 21, 2010, and, because of printing problems, did not enter circulation until nearly three and a half years later, on October 8, 2013. In addition to design changes introduced in 1996, the obverse features the brown quill that was used to sign the Declaration of Independence; faint phrases from the Declaration of Independence; the Syng inkstand&#x27;s inkwell; a bell within the inkwell&#x27;s image that appears and disappears depending on the angle at which the bill is viewed using optically variable ink (OVI) and changes from copper to green; teal background color; a borderless portrait of Benjamin Franklin; a blue &quot;3D security ribbon&quot; (trademarked &quot;Motion&quot; by Crane Currency) on which images of Liberty Bells shift into numerical designations of &#x27;100&#x27; as the note is tilted; and to the left of Franklin, small yellow 100s whose zeros form the EURion constellation. The reverse features a large gradient &#x27;100&#x27; printed vertically on the right side, small yellow EURion 100s and has the fine lines removed from around the vignette of Independence Hall. These notes were issued as &quot;Series 2009A&quot; with &quot;Rios&quot;&quot;-&quot;&quot;Geithner&quot; signatures. Many of these changes are intended not only to thwart counterfeiting but to also make it easier to quickly check authenticity and help vision-impaired people. The first of the Series 2009 bills were produced in February 2010 while the Series 2009A replacement banknote was first produced in September 2011.

==Withdrawal of large denomination bills ($500 and up)==

On July 14, 1969, the Federal Reserve announced that the large denominations of United States currency would be withdrawn from circulation; banks were instructed to return any notes received or deposited larger than $100 to the United States Treasury. While the larger denominations remained legal tender, with their removal, the $100 note was the largest denomination remaining in circulation. All the Federal Reserve Notes produced from &quot;Series 1928&quot; up to before &quot;Series 1969&quot; (i.e. 1928, 1928A, 1934, 1934A, 1934B, 1934C, 1934D, 1950, 1950A, 1950B, 1950C, 1950D, 1950E, 1963, 1966, 1966A) of the denomination added up to billion. Since some banknotes had been destroyed, and the population was 200 million at the time, there was less than one banknote per capita circulating.

As of June 30, 1969, the U.S. coins and banknotes in circulation of all denominations were worth of which was circulating overseas. The currency and coin circulating within the United States was per capita. Since 1969, the demand for U.S. currency has greatly increased. The total amount of circulating currency and coin passed one trillion dollars in March 2011.

Despite the degradation in the value of the U.S. banknote (which was worth about $ in 1969), and despite competition from some more valuable foreign notes (most notably, the 500 euro banknote), there are no current plans to re-issue banknotes above . Today&#x27;s widespread use of electronic means to conduct high-value transactions has made large-scale physical cash transactions for legitimate business unnecessary from the government&#x27;s point of view. Quoting T. Allison, Assistant to the Board of the Federal Reserve System in his October 8, 1998, testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Committee on Banking and Financial Services:

<text>Panteón Rococó is a Mexican ska band from Mexico City. Despite flourishing black markets, they have sold thousands of records. While being well-known stars in Mexico, they regularly tour Europe since early in their musical career, especially Germany, where their European Label &quot;Übersee Records&quot; is located.

== Musical style and lyrics ==
Panteón Rococó blends several styles of popular music such as rock, punk, salsa, mariachi, reggae, ska, and also mestizo-music into a very energetic, groovy sound. As they are very political people and support the EZLN in Chiapas, some of their lyrics contain political statements, while many other works are love songs.

<doc id="477362" wikidata="Q1721601" url="?curid=477362" title="Kaiser Permanente">
<text>Kaiser Permanente (; KP) is an American integrated managed care consortium headquartered in Oakland, California. Founded in 1945 by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser and physician Sidney R. Garfield, the organization was initially established to provide medical services at Kaiser&#x27;s shipyards, steel mills and other facilities, before being opened to the general public. Kaiser Permanente operates as a consortium comprising three distinct but interdependent entities: the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan (KFHP) and its regional subsidiaries, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and the regional Permanente Medical Groups. As of 2024, Kaiser Permanente serves eight states (California, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington) as well as the District of Columbia and is the largest managed care organization in the United States.

Each Permanente Medical Group functions as a separate for-profit partnership or professional corporation within its specific territory. While these groups do not publicly disclose their financial results, they are primarily funded by reimbursements from the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, one of the largest not-for-profit organizations in the United States. Kaiser employs over 300,000 individuals, including more than 98,000 physicians and nurses. The mixed-profit Kaiser Foundation Hospitals operate 40 hospitals and more than 614 medical offices, similarly funded by reimbursements from the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan.

Kaiser Permanente&#x27;s quality of care is often highly rated, attributed to its focus on preventive care, salaried physicians (as opposed to fee-for-service compensation), and efforts to reduce hospital stays by optimizing patient care planning. It has had disputes with employees&#x27; unions, faced charges for falsification of records and patient dumping, been under regulatory scrutiny for the quality of its mental health services, and seen criticism over the size of its financial reserves.

==Structure and governance==

Kaiser Permanente provides care throughout eight regions in the United States. Two or three (four, in the case of California) distinct but interdependent legal entities form the Kaiser system within each region. This structure was adopted by Kaiser Permanente physicians and leaders in 1955.

===Governance===
Each entity of Kaiser Permanente has its own management and governance structure, although all of the structures are interdependent and cooperative to a great extent. There are multiple affiliated mixed profits registered with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. According to Form 990 governance questions, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan do not have members with the power to appoint or elect board members, meaning that the board itself nominates and appoints new members.

James A. Vohs was appointed CEO in 1978 and chairman in 1980, and he would serve until his retirement in 1992. He was the first chairman to not be a member of the Kaiser family.

David M. Lawrence served as chairman and CEO until his retirement in 2002.

George Halvorson became the chairman and CEO until his retirement in December 2013.

On November 5, 2012, the board of directors announced that Bernard J. Tyson, Kaiser&#x27;s president and chief operating officer for the last two years, would replace Halvorson, marking the first time an African American was appointed as chairman. Tyson died in November 2019.
Greg A. Adams assumed the role of chairman and CEO in December 2019.

===Operations===
As of 2024, Kaiser Permanente had 12.5 million health plan members, 223,883 employees, 73,618 nurses and 24,605 physicians, 40 hospitals, and 614 medical offices. As of December 31, 2023, the Mixed profit Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals entities reported an operating income of $329 million on $100.8 billion in operating revenues.

The two types of organizations which make up each regional entity are:
* Kaiser Foundation Health Plans (KFHP) work with employers, employees, and individual members to offer prepaid health plans and insurance. The health plans are not-for-profit and provide infrastructure for and invest in Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and provide a tax-exempt shelter for the for-profit medical groups.
* Permanente Medical Groups are physician-owned organizations, which provide and arrange for medical care for Kaiser Foundation Health Plan members in each respective region. The medical groups are for-profit partnerships or professional corporations and receive nearly all of their funding from Kaiser Foundation Health Plans. The first medical group, The Permanente Medical Group (TPMG), formed in 1948 in Northern California, is one of the largest doctors groups in the United States with 11,225 medical professionals and 186 locations at the beginning of 2023. Permanente physicians become stockholders in TPMG after three years at the company.

In addition, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (despite the plural name, a single legal entity) operates medical centers in California, Oregon, and Hawaii, and outpatient facilities in the remaining Kaiser Permanente regions. The hospital foundation entity is not-for-profit and relies on the Kaiser Foundation Health Plans for funding. It also provides infrastructure and facilities that benefit the for-profit medical groups.

===Regional entities===
Kaiser Permanente is administered through eight regions, including one parent and six subordinate health plan entities, one hospital entity, and nine separate, affiliated medical groups:
* Northern California, 3,351,449 members

In addition to the regional entities, in 1997, the then-twelve Permanente Medical Groups created The Permanente Federation LLC, a separate entity, which focuses on standardizing patient care and performance under one name and system of policies. Around the same time, The Permanente Company was also chartered as a vehicle to provide investment opportunities for the for-profit Permanente Medical Groups. One of the ventures of the Permanente Company is Kaiser Permanente Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in emerging medical technologies.
===Lobbying entity===

A mutual benefit corporation named &quot;Kaiser Foundation for the Advancement of Integrated Health Care&quot; was established on December 27, 2017. The specific purpose of the corporation is &quot;to advocate for and promote the integrated models of health care&quot;. The corporation&#x27;s founder, Maryann Bodayle, has served as the &quot;Governance Administrator&quot; of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. since 2013.

==History==
===Early years===
The history of Kaiser Permanente dates to 1933 and a tiny hospital in the town of Desert Center, California. At that time, Henry J. Kaiser and several other large construction contractors had formed an insurance consortium called Industrial Indemnity to meet their workers&#x27; compensation obligations. Sidney Garfield had just finished his residency at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center at a time when jobs were scarce; he was able to secure a contract with Industrial Indemnity to care for 5,000 construction workers building the Colorado River Aqueduct in the Mojave Desert. Soon enough, Garfield&#x27;s new hospital was in a precarious financial state (with mounting debt and the staff of three going unpaid), due in part to Garfield&#x27;s desire to treat all patients regardless of ability to pay, as well as his insistence on equipping the hospital adequately so that critically injured patients could be stabilized for the long journey to full-service hospitals in Los Angeles.

Garfield won over two Industrial Indemnity executives, Harold Hatch and Alonzo B. Ordway. It was Hatch who proposed to Garfield the specific solution that would lead to the creation of Kaiser Permanente: Industrial Indemnity would prepay 17.5% of premiums, or $1.50 per worker per month, to cover work-related injuries, while the workers would each contribute five cents per day to cover non-work-related injuries. Later, Garfield also credited Ordway with coming up with the general idea of prepayment for industrial health care and explained that he did not know much at the time about other similar health plans except for the Ross-Loos Medical Group.

Hatch&#x27;s solution enabled Garfield to bring his budget back into the positive, and to experiment with providing a broader range of services to the workers besides pure emergency care. By the time work on the aqueduct concluded and the project was wrapped up, Garfield had paid off all of his debts, was supervising ten physicians at three hospitals, and controlled a financial reserve of $150,000.

Garfield returned to Los Angeles for further study at County-USC with the intent of entering private practice. In March 1938, Consolidated Industries (a consortium led by the Kaiser Company) initiated work on a contract for the upper half of the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state, and took over responsibility for the thousands of workers who had worked for a different construction consortium on the first half of the dam. Edgar Kaiser, Henry&#x27;s son, was in charge of the project. To smooth over relations with the workers (who had been treated poorly by their earlier employer), Hatch and Ordway persuaded Edgar to meet with Garfield, and in turn Edgar persuaded Garfield to tour the Grand Coulee site. Garfield subsequently agreed to reproduce at Grand Coulee Dam what he had done on the Colorado River Aqueduct project. He immediately spent $100,000 on renovating the decrepit Mason City Hospital and hired seven physicians.

Unlike the workers on Garfield&#x27;s first project, many workers at Grand Coulee Dam had brought dependents with them. The unions soon forced the Kaiser Company to expand its plan to cover dependents, which resulted in a dramatic shift from industrial medicine into family practice and enabled Garfield to formulate some of the basic principles of Kaiser Permanente. It was also during this time that Henry Kaiser personally became acquainted with Garfield and forged a friendship which lasted until Kaiser&#x27;s death.

===World War II===
In 1939, the Kaiser Company began work on several huge shipbuilding contracts in Oakland, and by the end of 1941 would control four major shipyards on the West Coast. During 1940, the expansion of the American defense-industrial complex in preparation for entrance into World War II resulted in a massive increase in the number of employees at the Richmond shipyard. In January 1941, Henry Kaiser asked Garfield to set up an insurance plan for the Richmond workers (this was merely contract negotiation with insurance companies), and a year later Kaiser asked Garfield to duplicate at Richmond what he had done at Desert Center and Mason City. Unlike the two other projects, the resulting entity lived on after the construction project that gave birth to it, and it is the direct ancestor of today&#x27;s Kaiser Permanente.

On March 1, 1942, Sidney R. Garfield &amp; Associates opened its offices in Oakland to provide care to 20,000 workers, followed by the opening of the Permanente Health Plan on June 1. From the beginning, Kaiser Permanente strongly supported preventive medicine and attempted to educate its members about maintaining their own health.

In July, the Permanente Foundation formed to operate Northern California hospitals that would be linked to the outpatient health plans, followed shortly thereafter by the creation of Northern Permanente Foundation for Oregon and Washington and Southern Permanente Foundation for California. The name Permanente came from Permanente Creek, which flowed past Henry Kaiser&#x27;s Kaiser Permanente Cement Plant on Black Mountain in Cupertino, California. Kaiser&#x27;s first wife, Bess Fosburgh, liked the name. An abandoned Oakland facility was modernized as the 170-bed Permanente Hospital opened on August 1, 1942 (this facility evolved over the decades into today&#x27;s flagship Kaiser Oakland Medical Center). Three weeks later, the 71-bed Richmond Field Hospital opened. Six first aid stations were set up in the shipyards to treat industrial accidents and minor illness. Each first aid station had an ambulance ready to rush patients to the surgical field hospital if required. Stabilized patients could be moved to the larger hospital for recuperative care. The Northern Permanente Hospital opened two weeks later to serve workers at the Kaiser shipyard in Vancouver, Washington. Shipyard workers paid seven cents per day for comprehensive health care coverage, and within a year, the shipyard health plan employed sixty physicians with salaries between $450 and $1,000 per month. These physicians established California Physicians Service to offer similar health coverage to the families of shipyard workers. In 1944, Kaiser decided to continue the program after the war and to open it up to the general public.

Meanwhile, during the war years, the American Medical Association (AMA) (which opposed managed care organizations from their very beginning) tried to defuse demand for managed care by promoting the rapid expansion of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield preferred provider organization networks.

&quot;Courage to Heal&quot;, a novel by KP Historical Society President and Medical Director Emeritus of KP San Diego Paul Bernstein, MD, is based on the story of Garfield&#x27;s life, his struggles with the AMA, and the origins of Kaiser Permanente.

===Postwar growth===
In 1943, Henry J. Kaiser and Dr. Sidney R. Garfield opened a 50-bed hospital, housing six physicians for the 3000 employees and their families at the new Kaiser Steel Mill in Fontana, California, offering a pre-paid health care plan for $0.60/week for adults, and $0.30/week for children. In 1945, the Kaiser Permanente health plan was opened to the public.

In 1948, Kaiser established the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation (also known as Kaiser Family Foundation), a U.S.-based Mixed profit, private operating foundation focusing on the major health care issues facing the nation. The Foundation, not associated with Kaiser Permanente or Kaiser Industries, is an independent voice and source of facts and analysis for policymakers, the media, the health care community, and the general public.

The end of World War II brought about a huge plunge in Kaiser Permanente membership; for example, 50,000 workers had left the Northern California yards by July 1945. Membership bottomed out at 17,000 for the entire system but then surged back to 26,000 within six months as Garfield aggressively marketed his plan to the public. Sidney Garfield &amp; Associates had been a sole proprietorship, but in 1948, it was reorganized into a partnership, Permanente Medical Group.

During this period, a substantial amount of growth came from union members; the unions saw Kaiser Permanente care as more affordable and comprehensive than what was available at the time from private physicians under the fee-for-service system. For example, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine had reported in 1944 that 90% of the U.S. population could not afford fee-for-service health care. Kaiser Permanente membership soared to 154,000 in 1950, 283,000 in 1952, 470,000 in 1954, 556,000 in 1956, and 618,000 in 1958.

From 1944 onward, both Kaiser Permanente and Garfield fought off numerous attacks from the AMA and various state and local medical societies. Henry Kaiser came to the defense of both Garfield and the health plans he had created.

In 1951, the organization acquired its current name when Henry Kaiser unilaterally directed the trustees of the health plans, hospital foundations, and medical groups to add his name before Permanente. The physicians in the Permanente Medical Group were proud professionals who deeply resented the implication that they were directly controlled by Kaiser, and successfully forced him to back off with respect to their part of the organization. That same year, Kaiser Permanente also began experiments with large-scale multiphasic screening to identify unknown conditions and to facilitate treatment of known ones. Simultaneously, although no one questioned his medical competence, Garfield&#x27;s deficiencies as an executive were becoming apparent as the organization expanded far beyond his ability to manage it properly.

With his wartime glory receding into history, Henry Kaiser became fascinated with the health care system created for him by Garfield and began to directly manage Kaiser Permanente and Garfield. This resulted in a financial disaster when Kaiser splurged on the new Walnut Creek hospital; his constant intermeddling led to significant friction at every level of the organization. The situation was not helped by Kaiser&#x27;s marriage to Garfield&#x27;s head administrative nurse (who had helped care for Kaiser&#x27;s first wife on her deathbed), convincing Garfield to marry the sister of that nurse, and then having Garfield move in next door to him. Clifford Keene (who would eventually serve as president of Kaiser Permanente) later recalled that this arrangement resulted in a rather dysfunctional and combative family in charge of Kaiser Permanente.

Keene was an experienced Permanente physician whom Garfield had personally hired in 1946. During 1953 he had been trying to get a job at U.S. Steel, but on the morning of December 5, 1953, with internal tensions worsening day by day, Garfield met with Keene at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco and asked him to turn around the organization. It took Keene 15 years to realize that Kaiser had forced Garfield to ask Keene to become his replacement. Due to the chaos on the board, Keene at first took control with the vague title of Executive Associate, but it soon became clear to everyone that he was actually in charge and Garfield was to become a lobbyist and &quot;ambassador&quot; for the HMO concept.

Even with Garfield out of day-to-day management, the underlying problem of Henry Kaiser&#x27;s authoritarian style continued. After several tense confrontations between Kaiser and Permanente Medical Group physicians, the doctors met with Kaiser&#x27;s top adviser, Eugene Trefethen, at Kaiser&#x27;s personal estate near Lake Tahoe on July 12, 1955. Trefethen came up with the idea of a contract between the medical groups and the health plans and hospital foundations that would set out roles, responsibilities, and financial distribution. Trefethen, already a successful attorney, went on to a successful career with Kaiser Permanente and in retirement became a famous vintner.

While Keene and Trefethen struggled to fix the damage from Kaiser&#x27;s micromanagement and Garfield&#x27;s ineffectual management, Henry Kaiser moved to Oahu in 1956 and insisted on expanding Kaiser Permanente into Hawaii in 1958. He quickly ruined what should have been a simple project, and only a last-minute intervention by Keene and Trefethen in August 1960 prevented the total disintegration of the Hawaii organization. By that year, Kaiser membership had grown to 808,000.

===Managed care era===

Having overseen Kaiser Permanente&#x27;s successful transformation from Henry Kaiser&#x27;s health care experiment into a large-scale self-sustaining enterprise, Keene retired in 1975. By 1976, membership reached three million. In 1977, all six of Kaiser Permanente&#x27;s regions had become federally qualified health maintenance organizations. 

In 1980, Kaiser acquired a Mixed profit group practice to create its Mid-Atlantic region, encompassing the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. In 1985, Kaiser Permanente expanded to Georgia.

===Regional evolution===

By 1990, Kaiser Permanente provided coverage for about a third of the population of the cities of San Francisco and Oakland; total Northern California membership was over 2.4 million.

Elsewhere, Kaiser Permanente did not do as well, and its geographic footprint changed significantly in the 1990s. The organization spun off or closed outposts in Texas, North Carolina, and the Northeast. In 1998, Kaiser Permanente sold its Texas operations, where reported problems had become so severe that the organization directed its lawyers to attempt to block the release of a Texas Department of Insurance report. This prompted the state attorney general to threaten to revoke the organization&#x27;s license. Kaiser Permanente closed health plans in Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham in North Carolina four years later. The organization also sold its unprofitable Northeast division in 2000. The Ohio division was sold to Catholic Health Partners in 2013.

In 1995, Kaiser Permanente celebrated its fiftieth anniversary as a public health plan. Two years later, national membership reached nine million. In 1997, the organization established an agreement with the AFL-CIO to explore a new approach to the relationship between management and labor, known as the Labor Management Partnership. Going into the new millennium, competition in the managed care market increased dramatically, raising new concerns. The Southern California Permanente Medical Group saw declining rates of new members as other managed care groups flourished.

In 2017, Kaiser acquired Group Health Cooperative, which serves clients in the state of Washington outside of Southwest Washington. Group Health was started in part from funds from longshoremen in Washington state, who were left out when Kaiser chose not to expand north of the Portland area.

On April 26, 2023, Kaiser announced it would acquire Geisinger Health System. As part of the deal, Geisinger would operate as an independent subsidiary, folded into a new mixed-profit group called Risant Health. On June 21, 2024, it was announced that Risant Health would acquire Cone Health, a hospital system based in Greensboro, North Carolina.

===KP HealthConnect===
In 2002, Kaiser Permanente abandoned its attempt to build its own clinical information system with IBM, writing off some $452 million in software assets. This information technology failure led to major changes in the organization&#x27;s approach to digital records. Under George Halvorson&#x27;s direction, Kaiser looked closely at two medical software vendors, Cerner and Epic Systems, ultimately selecting Epic as the primary vendor for a new system, branded KP HealthConnect. Although Kaiser&#x27;s approach shifted to &quot;buy, not build,&quot; the project was unprecedented for a civilian system in size and scope. Deployed across all eight regions over six years and at a cost of more than $6 billion, by 2010, it was the largest civilian electronic medical record system, serving more than 8.6 million Kaiser Permanente members, implemented at a cost exceeding a half million dollars per physician. As of 2020 KP HealthConnect supports 12.2 million members.

===International reputation===

Early in the 21st century, the NHS and UK Department of Health became impressed with some aspects of the Kaiser operation and initiated a series of studies involving several health care organizations in England. Visits occurred and suggestions of adopting some KP policies are currently active. The management of hospital bed-occupancy by KP, by means of integrated management in and out of hospital and monitoring progress against care pathways has given rise to trials of similar techniques in eight areas of the UK.

In 2002, a controversial study by California-based academics published in the British Medical Journal compared Kaiser to the British National Health Service, finding Kaiser to be superior in several respects. Subsequently, a group of health policy academics who were experts on the NHS published a competing analysis claiming that Kaiser&#x27;s costs were actually substantially higher than the NHS and for a younger and healthier population.

===2023 strike===
From October 4 to 7, 2023, more than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente workers went on strike. This has been regarded as the largest health care worker strike in U.S. history. A new four-year contract would later be ratified by 98.5% of the 85,000 members of the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions on November 9, 2023.

==Quality of care==

In the California Healthcare Quality Report Card 2013 Edition, Kaiser Permanente&#x27;s Northern California and Southern California regions, KP received four out of four possible stars in Meeting National Standards of Care. KP North and South also received three out of four stars in Members Rate Their HMO. KP&#x27;s performance has been attributed to three practices: First, KP places a strong emphasis on preventive care, reducing costs later on. Second, its doctors are salaried rather than paid per service, which removes the main incentive for doctors to perform unnecessary procedures. Thirdly, KP attempts to minimize the time patients spend in high-cost hospitals by carefully planning their stay and by shifting care to outpatient clinics. This practice results in lower costs per member, cost savings for KP and greater doctor attention to patients. A comparison to the UK&#x27;s National Health Service found that patients spend 2–5 times as much time in NHS hospitals as compared to KP hospitals.

In June 2013, the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) levied a $4 million fine, the second largest in the agency&#x27;s history, against Kaiser for not providing adequate mental health care to its patients. Alleged violations of California&#x27;s timely access laws included failures to accurately track wait times and track doctor availability amid evidence of inconsistent electronic and paper records. It was also found by the DMHC that patients received written materials circulated by Kaiser dissuading them from seeking care, a violation of state and federal laws. DMHC also issued a cease and desist order for Kaiser to end the practices. DMHC conducted a follow-up investigation which published in April 2015. The report found Kaiser had put systems in place to better track how patients were being cared for but still had not addressed problems with actually providing mental health care that complied with state and federal laws. Kaiser&#x27;s challenges on this front were exacerbated by a long, unresolved labor dispute with the union representing therapists.

Kaiser appealed the findings, the order, and the fine, and sought to keep the proceedings closed, but in September 2014, in the face of the administrative judge&#x27;s order to keep the proceedings open, and facing the beginning of public testimony, Kaiser withdrew the appeal and paid the $4 million. It also issued a statement which denied much of the wrongdoing. Kaiser faces ongoing inspections by DMHC and three class-action lawsuits related to the issues identified by the DMHC.

==Research and publishing==
Kaiser operates a Division of Research, which annually conducts between 200 and 300 studies, and the Center for Health Research, which in 2009 had more than 300 active studies. Kaiser&#x27;s bias toward prevention is reflected in the areas of interest—vaccine and genetic studies are prominent. The work is funded primarily by federal, state, and other outside (non-Kaiser) institutions.

Kaiser has created and operates a voluntary biobank of donated blood samples from members along with their medical record and the responses to a lifestyle and health survey. As of November 2018, the Kaiser Permanente Research Bank had over 300,000 samples, with a goal of 500,000. De-identified data is shared with both Kaiser researchers and researchers from other institutions.

==Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine==
Kaiser Permanente announced its plan to start a medical school in December, 2015, and the school welcomed its inaugural class in June 2020. The vision for the school is to redesign physician education around the pillars of patient-centered care, population health, quality improvement, team-based care, and health equity.

Mark Schuster was named the medical school&#x27;s Founding Dean and CEO in 2017. The Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine was renamed from the Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine in November 2019 in honor of late Kaiser Permanente Chairman and CEO Bernard J. Tyson. The medical school received preliminary LCME accreditation in February 2019 and received full LCME accreditation in June 2024. The school will waive all tuition for the full four years of medical school for its first five classes.   

==Controversies ==

===Patient dumping===

In 2006 Kaiser settled five cases for alleged patient dumping—the delivery of homeless hospitalized patients to other agencies or organizations in order to avoid expensive medical care—between 2002 and 2005. Los Angeles city officials had filed civil and criminal legal action against Kaiser Permanente for patient dumping, which was the first action of its kind that the city had taken. The city&#x27;s decision to charge Kaiser Permanente reportedly was influenced by security camera footage, allegedly showing a 63-year-old patient, dressed in hospital gown and slippers, wandering toward a mission on Skid Row (this footage was prominently featured in the Michael Moore 2007 documentary &quot;Sicko&quot;). At the time that the complaint was filed, city officials said that 10 other hospitals were under investigation for similar issues. Kaiser settled the case, paying $5,000 in civil penalties and agreeing to spend $500,000 on services for the homeless. During that same period, the Department of Health and Human Services&#x27; Office of the Inspector General settled 102 cases against U.S. hospitals that resulted in a monetary payment to the agency.

===Organ transplant program===

In 2004, Northern California Kaiser Permanente initiated an in-house program for kidney transplantation. Prior to opening the transplant center, Northern California Kaiser patients would generally receive transplants at medical centers associated with the University of California (UC San Francisco and UC Davis). Upon opening the transplant center, Kaiser required that members who are transplant candidates in Northern California obtain services exclusively through its internal KP-owned transplant center.

While it was in operation, the Kaiser program had a 100% survival rate, which is better than other transplant centers. Patients who wanted a kidney were less likely to get one. Northern California Kaiser performed 56 transplants in 2005, and twice that many patients died while waiting for a kidney. At other California transplant centers, more than twice as many people received kidneys than died during the same period. Unlike other centers, the Kaiser program did not perform riskier transplants or use donated organs from elderly or other higher-risk people, which have worse outcomes. Northern California Kaiser closed the kidney transplant program in May 2006. As before, Northern California Kaiser now pays for pre-transplant care and transplants at other hospitals. This change affected approximately 2,000 patients.

===Mandatory arbitration===
Kaiser requires an agreement by planholders to submit patient malpractice claims to arbitration rather than litigating through the court system. This has triggered some opposition.

===Labor unions===
While Doctors of Medicine (M.D.) and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) are partners within the for-profit physician groups, many employees are members of various unions and guilds, depending on their role and service area.

KP&#x27;s California operations were subject to four labor strikes in 2011 and 2012, involving nurses, mental health providers, and other professionals. The National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW) accused Kaiser of deliberately stalling negotiations while profiting $2.1 billion in 2011 and paying its CEO George Halvorson $9 million annually. The workers were dissatisfied with proposed changes to pensions and other benefits.

On November 11, 2014, an estimated 18,000 nurses went on strike at KP hospitals in Northern California over Ebola safeguards and patient-care standards during union contract talks. 21 hospitals and 35 clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area were affected.

In October 2023, as many as 75,000 Kaiser healthcare workers went on a three-day strike at KP hospitals and clinics. The Union had accused Kaiser of failing to address critical staff shortages, and demanded higher pay for staff. In November 2023 the workers voted to ratify a new four-year contract that addressed the demands.

On October 21, 2024, 2,400 Kaiser Permanente Southern California mental health therapists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses went on strike for equity. The National Union of Healthcare Workers members are striking for adequate staffing and time to complete all patient care tasks, pay increases that are equitable to other Kaiser employees and that keep up with inflation, and the restoration of pension benefits to match what 95% or more Kaiser employees are already receiving. This strike is ongoing as of 12/25/2024. 

The California Department of Managed Healthcare (DMHC) has begun investigating Kaiser&#x27;s contingency plan during the strike. Kaiser reports that they have comprehensive plans to ensure patient access to care, and this is currently being closely monitored by the DMHC.

=== Strikes and labor disputes ===
Kaiser Permanente has experienced numerous labor disputes and strikes across its history, often centered on staffing levels, wages, and working conditions. These disputes have involved several unions, including the National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW), the Alliance of Health Care Unions (AHCU), and the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions (CKPU). Below is a comprehensive account of major strikes involving these unions.

==== National Union of Healthcare Workers ====
The National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW) has led several significant strikes involving Kaiser Permanente employees. These strikes often focused on issues such as staffing shortages, patient care, and working conditions.

* January 12–16, 2015: Approximately 2,600 mental health clinicians and 700 optical workers in California conducted a five-day strike to protest staffing shortages and patient care issues.

* December 10–14, 2018: Approximately 4,000 mental health clinicians and other healthcare professionals in California participated in a five-day strike advocating for improved patient care and working conditions.

* March 18–22, 2019: NUHW-represented mental health clinicians conducted a five-day strike addressing issues related to patient care and staffing.

* November 11–15, 2019: Mental health clinicians and healthcare professionals held a five-day strike to protest staffing shortages and advocate for better patient care.

* August 15 – October 18, 2022: Nearly 2,000 mental health therapists in Northern California engaged in a 10-week strike, concluding with a tentative agreement addressing patient care and staffing concerns.

* August 29, 2022 – February 16, 2023: Approximately 50 mental health clinicians in Hawai&#x27;i conducted a 172-day strike, the longest mental health strike in U.S. history, to secure a first contract.

* October 21, 2024 – Present: Over 2,400 mental health professionals in Southern California began an open-ended strike focusing on staffing shortages and increased workloads.

==== Alliance of Health Care Unions ====
* November 2021: Over 30,000 AHCU members planned a strike over staffing shortages and a proposed two-tier wage system. A tentative agreement was reached on November 13, 2021, averting the strike.

==== Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions ====
* October 4–7, 2023: From October 4 to 7, 2023, approximately 75,000 healthcare workers conducted a three-day strike, making it the largest healthcare worker strike in U.S. history. The strike focused on staffing shortages and wage concerns. A tentative agreement was reached on October 13, 2023, setting minimum hourly wages at $25 in California and $23 in other states and providing a 21% wage increase over four years.

==== Other ====
* 2011–2012: KP&#x27;s California operations experienced four labor strikes involving nurses, mental health providers, and other professionals. The NUHW accused Kaiser of stalling negotiations while profiting $2.1 billion in 2011 and paying its CEO George Halvorson $9 million annually.
* November 11, 2014: Approximately 18,000 nurses went on strike over Ebola safeguards and patient-care standards during union contract talks, affecting 21 hospitals and 35 clinics in Northern California.
* October 2023: Approximately 75,000 healthcare workers went on a three-day strike, demanding higher pay and addressing staff shortages. A new four-year contract was ratified in November 2023.

=== Regulatory oversight ===
During the ongoing 2024 Southern California mental health strike, the California Department of Managed Healthcare (DMHC) began investigating Kaiser’s contingency plans to ensure compliance with patient care standards.

===Cash reserves===
Jamie Court, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights has said that Kaiser&#x27;s retained profits are evidence that Kaiser policies are overpriced and that health insurance regulation is needed.

State insurance regulations require that insurers maintain certain minimum amounts of cash reserves to ensure that they are able to meet their obligations; the amount varies by insurer, based on its risk factors, such as its investments, how many people it insures, and other factors; a few states also have caps on how large the reserves can be.

Kaiser has been criticized by activists and state regulators for the size of its cash reserves. As of 2015, it had $21.7 billion in cash reserves, which was about 1,600% the amount required by California state regulations. Its reserves had been a target of advertising by Consumer Watchdog supporting Proposition 45 in California&#x27;s 2014 elections. At the end of 2010 Kaiser held $666 million in reserves, which was about 1,300% of the minimum required under Colorado state law. Those funds were in Kaiser&#x27;s risk-based capital account, held to pay for disasters or major projects. In 2008, the Colorado regulator required Kaiser to spend down its reserves; after negotiations Kaiser agreed to spend $155 million of its reserves giving credits to its clients and building clinics in underserved parts of the state.

===COVID-19===
Kaiser was cited by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health twelve times and fined nearly $500,000 for violations early in the COVID-19 pandemic pertaining to staff safety following outbreaks of COVID in its hospitals across the state, particularly in the Bay Area. Kaiser appealed the citations. Kaiser was responsible for more than 10% of all COVID violations in California. A COVID-19 outbreak sickened 92 people at Kaiser San Jose Medical Center on Christmas Day 2020. Kaiser San Leandro received the largest portion of fines, nearly $90k, for delays in reporting COVID infections and for failure to ration medical equipment according to pandemic regulations.

<text>The Régence (, &quot;Regency&quot;) was the period in French history between 1715 and 1723 when King Louis XV was considered a minor and the country was instead governed by Philippe II, Duke of Orléans (a nephew of Louis XIV of France) as prince regent. This was not the only regency in French history but the name is still associated with this period.

Philippe was able to take power away from Louis-Auguste, Duke of Maine (illegitimate son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan) who had been the favourite son of the late king and possessed much influence. From 1715 to 1718 the &quot;Polysynody&quot; changed the system of government in France, in which each minister (secretary of state) was replaced by a council. The &quot;système de Law&quot; was also introduced, which transformed the finances of the bankrupted kingdom and its aristocracy. Both Cardinal Dubois and Cardinal Fleury were highly influential during this time.

Contemporary European rulers included Philip V of Spain, John V of Portugal, George I of Great Britain, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, and Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia, the maternal grandfather of Louis XV.

==General==

===People===
The Men

*Philippe II, Duke of Orléans (2 August 1674 – 2 December 1723) born at his father&#x27;s Château de Saint-Cloud, he was the Duke of Chartres from birth; his mother, whom he was very close to, was a German princess of the Palatinate named Elizabeth Charlotte. In 1692 he married his first cousin, Françoise-Marie de Bourbon – the youngest illegitimate daughter of Philippe&#x27;s uncle Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. He died at Versailles in the arms of his mistress;
*Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon (18 August 1692 – 27 January 1740) son of Louis III, Prince of Condé and Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, he was thus the nephew of Philippe d&#x27;Orléans and was the Chief minister of France 1723–26; he was a great rival of the Regent and the House of Orléans in general;
*Louis-Auguste, Duke of Maine (31 March 1670 – 14 May 1736) favourite but illegitimate son of Louis XIV and Madame de Maintenon, he was despised by the Princes of the Blood due to his constant honours and great wealth he accumulated from his father. He died at Sceaux aged 66;
*John Law (pronounced &quot;Jean Lass&quot;) (21 April 1671 – 21 March 1729) was a Scottish economist who believed that money was only a means of exchange that did not constitute wealth in itself and that national wealth depended on trade. He was responsible for the Mississippi Bubble and a chaotic economic collapse in France; he died in Venice.

The Women

*Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain (31 March 1718 – 15 January 1781) was the eldest daughter of Philip V of Spain and his second wife Elisabeth of Parma; born in Madrid, she moved to France in 1721 and lived at the Tuileries Palace in Paris with her proposed husband; the engagement was broken off due to tense relations regarding the marriages of the Regent&#x27;s daughters to Philip V&#x27;s sons. The Infanta was sent back to Spain and later married the future Joseph I of Portugal; the present Brazilian Imperial Family descends from Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Louis XV as well as Mariana Victoria;
*Françoise Marie de Bourbon (4 May 1677 – 1 February 1749) was an illegitimate child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. She married Philippe d&#x27;Orléans and was mother of 8 of his children including the next Duke of Orléans; she died at the Château de Saint-Cloud aged 71;
*Anne Louise Bénédicte de Bourbon (8 November 1676 – 23 January 1753) was the wife of the Duke of Maine and thus daughter-in-law of Louis XIV; she was one of the Regent&#x27;s most ardent enemies and was the aunt of the Duke of Bourbon; she was also the granddaughter of the &quot;Le Grand Condé&quot;; she held court at Sceaux and was exiled to Dijon after the Cellamare Conspiracy was discovered; she died in Paris having outlived most of her generation;

===Places===
*&quot;Palace of Versailles&quot; : Birthplace of Louis XV and the home of the French court before and after the Regency; it was at Versailles that the Duke of Orléans died in 1723;
*&quot;Palais-Royal&quot; : Paris home of the House of Orléans; it was from there that the Regent handled state affairs; his last daughter, Louise Diane, was also born at the palace;
*&quot;Tuileries Palace&quot; : the childhood home of Louis XV during the Regency; Louis XV was installed in the &quot;Grand Appartements&quot; of Louis XIV located on the second floor.

===Politics===
The Régence marked the temporary eclipse of Versailles as centre of policymaking, since the Regent&#x27;s court was at the Palais Royal in Paris. It marked the rise of Parisian salons as cultural centres, as literary meeting places and nuclei of discreet liberal resistance to some official policies. In the Paris salons aristocrats mingled more easily with the &quot;higher Bourgeoisie&quot; in a new atmosphere of relaxed decorum, comfort and intimacy.

===Art history===
In the arts, the style of the Régence is marked by early Rococo, characterised by the paintings of Antoine Watteau (1684–1721).

Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design. Louis XIV&#x27;s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion. By the end of the old king&#x27;s reign, rich Baroque designs were giving way to lighter elements with more curves and natural patterns. These elements are obvious in the architectural designs of Nicolas Pineau. During the Régence, court life moved away from Versailles and this artistic change became well established, first in the royal palace and then throughout French high society. The delicacy and playfulness of Rococo designs is often seen as perfectly in tune with the excesses of Louis XV&#x27;s regime.

The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France. The style had spread beyond architecture and furniture to painting and sculpture, exemplified by the works of Watteau and François Boucher. Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

===Colonialism===
The &quot;Régence&quot; is also the customary French word for the pre-independence regimes in the western North African countries, the so-called Barbary Coast. It was applied to:
*First the Barbary Coast (Maghrebinian countries in North Africa) was formally Ottoman, but de facto independent (dominated by military governors, soon de facto princes, styled dey, bey or beylerbey, and by the raïs, Muslim corsairs).

<text>The Great Park is a public park in Irvine, California, with a focus on sports, agriculture, and the arts. It is a non-aviation reuse of the decommissioned Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) El Toro. The Orange County park comprises 28.8% of the total area that once made up the air base. The project was approved by the voters of Orange County in 2002 at $1.1 billion.

==History==
The Great Park was the site of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro from 1943 to 1999. In 1993, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended closing MCAS El Toro and transferring its activities to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. This led to a lengthy political and public relations battle over the subsequent use of the base after its closure, and the issue figured prominently in Orange County politics during the late 1990s. Initial proposals included a commercial airport, housing, and the Great Park. In 2001, Orange County voters passed Measure W, authorizing the former air station&#x27;s use as a central park/nature preserve and multi-use development. The measure was passed, which led to the designation of the land as the Great Park.

The original plan for the infrastructure of the Great Park was virtually identical to Newport Center, with five roads connecting into a central loop road separating the park into blocks. The design was later modified to include a large section of runway and conform more to the layout of the original base, as a reminder of its history. Most prominent in the park plans is the restoration of Agua Chinon Creek, which had been channeled underground ever since the base was built in the 1940s.

A contest was held for the design of the park; the winning design was created by a team of landscape architects led by Ken Smith.

In the midst of the 2008 US housing crisis, developer Lennar struggled to fulfill its part of the bargain, including delayed construction of planned housing and of a &quot;community facilities district.&quot;

The Irvine City Council passed a vote in July 2014 for a plan that included removal of the canyon from the Great Park plan. FivePoint Communities was also given approval for 4,606 more homes near the park in exchange for $200 million to develop 688 acres (known locally as the &quot;Not So Great Park&quot;) of the park which will include golf courses, a sports park, and nature trails. The remaining 3,994 acres or 85% went to developers and additional city infrastructure.

The park has become a political football in Irvine city politics, with historical proponents of the airport and opponents of the park criticizing the implementation. In 2012, political opponents of long-term City Councilmember Larry Agran — including newly-elected Mayor Steven Choi and Councilmembers Christina Shea and Jeff Lalloway — won a 3-2 majority on the City Council, and called for another audit of Great Park expenditures. Agran and the other members of the City Council voted for the new audit, specifying that the cost should not exceed $250,000. Councilmembers Christina Shea and Jeff Lalloway appointed themselves to a newly constituted City Council Subcommittee charged with overseeing the audit. Through this two-person Subcommittee, Shea and Lalloway hired an accounting firm to conduct the audit: Hagen, Streiff, Newton &amp; Oshiro (HSNO). The HSNO accounting firm was hired without a public bidding process. The Shea-Lalloway City Council subcommittee commissioned a forensic audit which claimed mismanagement of public dollars at the park. In January 2020, the accounting firm in charge of the audit, Hagen Streiff Newton &amp; Oshiro, Accountants, lost its professional license and was charged $550,000 in fines, as the California Board of Accountancy said the firm “failed to comply with professional standards, engaged in numerous acts of negligence, and disseminated false and misleadingly information” in performing the Great Park audit.

Ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, an organization organized by tourism company Visit Anaheim called the OC Sports Commission was tasked with identifying a potential site to host one or multiple national teams in Orange County as a team base camp. After identifying possible venues, the Great Park and the Championship Soccer Stadium was chosen to be advertised to FIFA, due to the park being one of the few venues in the area that met the requirements of having two FIFA regulation-sized soccer pitches and natural grass. The park was officially identified in June 2024 as a potential host site.

==Description== 
Great Park was designed by a team of landscape architects led by architect Ken Smith. Smith&#x27;s plan was chosen from those submitted as part of an international contest for the park&#x27;s design.

The park is owned by the City of Irvine and run by the non-profit Great Park Corporation; the corporation is governed by current city council members.

==Points of interest==
The Great Park has a variety of attractions and activities centering around fitness, agriculture, and the arts. The Great Park also has venues for special events including a restored hangar and a terraced lawn.

===Attractions===
The Great Park Balloon is the park&#x27;s signature attraction. On July 14, 2007, the balloon ride—designed and operated by Aerophile SA—was the first attraction to open in the park. It transports visitors to a height of for a panoramic view of the county and the construction of the park. The balloon&#x27;s gondola can fit 25–30 people.

==Construction and future projects==
The sports complex construction took place over multiple phases. A soccer stadium, volleyball courts, tennis courts, and a playground were constructed over as part of phase one, which opened in 2017. Phase two expanded the complex to and included a baseball stadium; turf fields for soccer, football, rugby, or lacrosse; basketball courts; and additional baseball, softball, and soccer fields. The project was completed with the grand opening of the baseball and softball facilities in September 2018.

The park&#x27;s ice facility had a ground breaking ceremony hosted by the NHL&#x27;s Anaheim Ducks in February 2017. The facility includes four ice sheets to support a variety of professional, youth, and adult programs including figure skating, hockey, curling, and broomball. It opened in December 2018.

The Cultural Terrace section in the southeast part of the park covers and is still in the planning stages. The City of Irvine is considering including an amphitheater, museums, and a library, and in June 2017 approved an exclusive negotiating agreement with Wild Rivers, a water park that operated further south in Irvine for 25 years before closing in 2011 when its lease expired. The new water park opened in July 2022. Some residents are urging the inclusion of a botanical garden. of the Cultural Terrace section were leased to a company that operates a green waste and recycling plant there. On April 20, 2023, it was announced that the architectural firm SWA Group’s Laguna Beach branch released newly updated plans for the park, including extra room for the supposed 40-acre botanical garden should it be expanded in the future after it is built. In addition to botanical gardens, there will be an outdoor amphitheater with 12,000 seats, a museum, lakes, farms, a library, more trails and playgrounds and a 200-acre sports park.

In May 2022 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the City of Irvine and Flying Leatherneck Aviation Museum to relocate the museum from Marine Corps Air Station Miramar back to the Great Park, which once housed the museum when the area was MCAS El Toro. The current plan is for the museum to reopen in fall 2025-Spring 2026.

The stadium is expected to cost $30 million and seat upwards of 10,000 spectators once it is completed in 2024 or 2025. Plans for a dedicated cricket stadium in the area were announced by CEO Venky Mysore in April 2021. The selection of Great Park for the 10,000-seat stadium was revealed the following year. It is designated as one of two venues in Los Angeles for Cricket at the 2028 Summer Olympics, alongside the Leo Magnus Cricket Complex.

<doc id="477372" wikidata="Q968017" url="?curid=477372" title="Large denominations of United States currency">
<text>Large denominations of United States currency greater than were circulated by the United States Treasury until 1969. Since then, U.S. dollar banknotes have been issued in seven denominations: $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100.

==Overview and history==
Large-denomination currency (i.e., banknotes with a face value of or higher) had been used in the United States since the late 18th century. The first note was issued by North Carolina, authorized by legislation dated May 10, 1780. Virginia quickly followed suit and authorized the printing of and notes on October 16, 1780, and notes on May 7, 1781. High-denomination treasury notes were issued; for example, during the War of 1812 ($1,000 notes authorized by an act dated June 30, 1812). During the American Civil War, Confederate currency included and notes. The earliest (1861) federal banknotes included high-denomination notes such as three-year interest-bearing notes of , , and , authorized by Congress on July 17, 1861. In total, 11 different types of U.S. currency were issued in high-denomination notes across nearly 20 different series dates.
The obverse designs of United States banknotes generally depict either historical figures, allegorical figures symbolizing significant concepts (e.g., liberty, justice), or both. The reverse designs range from abstract scroll-work with ornate denomination identifiers to reproductions of historical art works.

==Public versus institutional use==
Series 1934 gold certificates ($100; ; ; ; and ) were issued after the gold standard was repealed and gold was compulsorily confiscated by order of President Franklin Roosevelt on March 9, 1933 (see United States Executive Order 6102). Thus, the series 1934 notes were used only for intragovernmental (i.e., Federal Reserve Bank) transactions and were not issued to the public. This series was discontinued in 1940. The series 1928 gold certificate reverse was printed in black and green (see History of the United States dollar).

==Passive retirement==
Although they remain legal tender in the United States, high-denomination bills were last printed on December 27, 1945, and were officially discontinued on July 14, 1969, by the Federal Reserve System because of &quot;lack of use&quot;. The lower production and notes had effectively disappeared well before then.

Beginning in July 1969, the Federal Reserve began removing high-denomination currency from circulation and destroying any large bills returned by banks. , only 336 bills were known to exist, along with 342 bills, 165,372 bills and fewer than 75,000 bills (of over 900,000 printed). Due to their rarity, collectors pay considerably more than the face value of the bills to acquire them, and some are in museums in other parts of the world. 

These larger denomination bills were mainly used by banks and the federal government for large financial transactions, which was especially true for gold certificates from 1865 to 1934. Given that the introduction of electronic money systems has made large-scale cash transactions mostly obsolete, as well as concerns about counterfeiting and the use of cash for unlawful activities (such as drug trafficking and money laundering), it is unlikely that the U.S. government will reissue any large-denomination currency in the foreseeable future.

According to the U.S. Department of Treasury website, &quot;The present denominations of our currency in production are , , , , , and . The purpose of the United States currency system is to serve the needs of the public and these denominations meet that goal. Neither the Department of the Treasury nor the Federal Reserve System has any plans to change the denominations in use today.&quot;

==High-denomination banknote issuing data==
==Table of banknotes==
The National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian Institution contains the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) certified proofs and the Treasury Department collection of United States currency. Using a combination of proofs and issued notes, a nearly complete type set of high-denomination currency was compiled. Notably missing are several types of Compound and Interest Bearing Notes. Printed during the early to mid-1860s on very thin paper, these high-denomination notes are virtually non-existent. Their issuance (1861–65) predates the BEP&#x27;s responsibility for U.S. currency (1870s), so it is fortunate that any proofs exist in the current archives.

<text>Jean Rouch (; 31 May 1917 – 18 February 2004) was a French filmmaker and anthropologist.

He is considered one of the founders of cinéma vérité in France. Rouch&#x27;s practice as a filmmaker, for over 60 years in Africa, was characterized by the idea of &quot;shared anthropology&quot;. 
Influenced by his discovery of surrealism in his early twenties, many of his films blur the line between fiction and documentary, creating a new style: ethnofiction. The French New Wave filmmakers hailed Rouch as one of their own.

Commenting on Rouch&#x27;s work as someone &quot;in charge of research for the Musée de l&#x27;Homme&quot; in Paris, Godard said, “Is there a better definition for a filmmaker?&quot;.

==Biography==
Rouch began his long association with Nigerien subjects in 1941, when he arrived in Niamey as a French colonial hydrology engineer to supervise a construction project in Niger. There he met Damouré Zika, the son of a Songhai traditional healer and fisherman, near the town of Ayorou, on the Niger River. After ten Sorko workers were killed by lightning at a construction depot Rouch supervised, Zika&#x27;s grandmother, a famous possession medium and spiritual advisor, presided over a ritual for men, which Rouch later claimed sparked his desire to make ethnographic film. He became interested in Zarma and Songhai ethnology, filming Songhai rituals and ceremonies. Rouch sent his work to his teacher Marcel Griaule, who encouraged him to continue it.

Shortly afterward, Rouch returned to France to participate in the Resistance. After the war, he did a brief stint as a journalist with Agence France-Presse before returning to Africa, where he became an influential anthropologist and sometimes controversial filmmaker.

Zika and Rouch became friends. In 1950, Rouch started to use Zika as the central character of his films, registering the traditions, culture, and ecology of the people of the Niger River valley. The first film in which Zika appeared was &quot;Bataille sur le grand fleuve&quot; (1950–52), portraying the life, ceremonies and hunting of Sorko fishermen. Rouch spent four months travelling with Sorko fishermen in a traditional pirogue.

His early films, such as &quot;Hippopotamus Hunt&quot; (&quot;Chasse à l&#x27;Hippopotame&quot;, 1946), &quot;Cliff Cemetery&quot; (&quot;Cimetière dans la Falaise&quot;, 1951), and &quot;The Rain Makers&quot; (&quot;Les Hommes qui Font la Pluie&quot;, 1951), were traditional, narrated reports, but he gradually became more innovative.

Rouch made his first films in Niger: &quot;Au pays des mages noirs&quot; (1947), &quot;Initiation à la danse des possédés&quot; (1948) and &quot;Les magicians de Wanzarbé&quot; (1949), all of which documented Songhai spirit possession rituals and the Zarma and Sorko peoples living along the Niger River. He is generally considered the father of Nigerien cinema. Despite arriving as a colonialist in 1941, Rouch remained in Niger after independence and mentored a generation of Nigerien filmmakers and actors, including Zika.

During the 1950s, Rouch began to produce longer ethnographic films. In 1954 he cast Zika in &quot;Jaguar&quot; as a young Songhai man traveling for work to the Gold Coast. Three men dramatized their real-life roles in the film, and became the first three actors of Nigerien cinema. Zika helped reedit the film, originally a silent ethnographic piece, into a feature-length movie somewhere between documentary and fiction (docufiction), and provided dialogue and commentary for a 1969 release. In 1957 Rouch directed &quot;Moi, un noir&quot; in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire with the young Nigerien filmmaker Oumarou Ganda, who had recently returned from French military service in Indochina. Ganda became the first great Nigerien film director and actor. By the early 1970s, Rouch, with cast, crew, and co-writing from his Nigerien collaborators, was producing full-length dramatic films in Niger, such as &#x27; (&quot;Little by Little&quot; : 1971) and &#x27; (&quot;Cocka-doodle-doo Mr. Chicken&quot;: 1974).

Many African filmmakers rejected Rouch&#x27;s and others&#x27; ethnographic films produced in the colonial era for distorting reality. Rouch is considered a pioneer of Nouvelle Vague and visual anthropology, and the father of ethnofiction. His films are mostly &quot;cinéma vérité&quot;, a term Edgar Morin used in a 1960 France-Observateur article referring to the Kino-Pravda newsreels of Dziga Vertov. Rouch&#x27;s best-known film, one of the central works of the Nouvelle Vague, is &quot;Chronique d&#x27;un été&quot; (1961), which he filmed with sociologist Edgar Morin and portrays the social life of contemporary France. Throughout his career, he reported on life in Africa. Over the course of five decades, he made almost 120 films.

Rouch and Jean-Michel Arnold founded an international documentary film festival, the Cinéma du Réel, at the Pompidou Centre in Paris in 1978.

In 1996, following the election of Nelson Mandela, Rouch visited the Centre for Rhetoric Studies at the University of Cape Town at Philippe-Joseph Salazar&#x27;s invitation. He gave two lectures on his work and shot some footage in the Black townships with his assistant Rita Sherman.

Rouch died in a car accident in February 2004, 16 kilometres from Birni-N&#x27;Konni, Niger.

In her 2017 essay &quot;How the Art World, and Art Schools, Are Ripe for Sexual Abuse&quot;, contemporary artist Coco Fusco details an early encounter with Rouch: &quot;I was sexually accosted by the renowned ethnographic filmmaker Jean Rouch, who is credited with having invented a better way to look at Africans.&quot;

<text>Just Married is a 2003 romantic comedy film directed by Shawn Levy, written by Sam Harper, and stars Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy as a young newlywed couple from different social classes who take their honeymoon to Europe, where obstacles challenge their ability to sustain in marriage. Produced by Robert Simonds, the film was successful at the box office despite generally negative reviews.

==Plot==
The film opens with Tom and Sarah in the airport, then flashes back from the moment they met up to the present.

Working-class Tom Leezak and upper-class Sarah McNerney meet up when Tom accidentally hits Sarah with a football on the beach. A few months later, despite opposition from Sarah&#x27;s rich family, they get married. Each has kept one secret from the other: Tom doesn&#x27;t tell her that he accidentally killed her dog and Sarah doesn&#x27;t tell him that she slept with Peter Prentiss, a childhood family friend, after they started dating.

Flying to Europe for their honeymoon, they attempt to consummate their marriage by joining the mile high club, but fail rather publicly. Arriving at their classy hotel at the foot of the Alps they find that Peter has sent them a bottle of cognac &quot;with love&quot;, while Tom&#x27;s friend Kyle has sent them a &quot;Thunderstick A-200&quot; sex toy.

When Tom tries to force the toy&#x27;s American plug into the European outlet, he shuts down the entire village&#x27;s electricity. The newlyweds leave the hotel after Tom has a heated argument with the hotel owner and pays a large bill to repair the power. While trying to find another hotel they crash their mini car into a snowbank, stuck until daylight and once again unable to consummate their marriage.

They make their way to Venice, staying at a &quot;pensione&quot; recommended by Tom&#x27;s father. It turns out to be a wreck, and they soon check out after a cockroach crawls over Tom when they try to have sex.

The couple secure a luxurious Venetian hotel with the grudging financial help of Sarah&#x27;s father. They go sightseeing, but Tom quickly gets bored and abandons her to watch sports in a bar. Sarah runs into Peter, who is staying at their hotel on business. This prompts her to initiate a conversation with Tom in which they reveal their secrets about her dog&#x27;s death and Peter. They each storm out of the hotel and go their separate ways: he going back to the bar, where he meets American tourist Wendy, and she going sightseeing, where Peter follows her.

Wendy flirts and dances with Tom, who escapes through a bathroom window when he realizes she wants to have sex with him. He returns to the hotel, learning that Sarah has gone out with Peter for the evening. Accosted by Wendy, he finds himself tricked into walking her to his hotel room, where she rips off her top before Tom blurts out that he&#x27;s on his honeymoon, upon which she finally leaves.

Sarah gets drunk so Peter takes her back to the hotel. When he kisses her at the entrance, she slaps him, reminding him that she&#x27;s on her honeymoon. Tom sees the kiss from the balcony but not the slap. When he confronts her in their room, Sarah finds Wendy&#x27;s bra. Peter bursts in to ask her to run away with him to Seattle, leading to a fight that lands Tom and Sarah in jail – still without consummating their marriage. Peter bails them out and the couple angrily decide to go home to Los Angeles, returning to the opening moments of the film.

Sarah has moved out and Tom wants to get back with her. Receiving advice from his father, he attempts to see her at her family&#x27;s estate, but is unsuccessful trying to ram the gate. Tom decides to give a truthful explanation to Sarah’s family about his uncertainty of his and Sarah’s marriage and future. However he declares his love for Sarah and makes it clear he will continue to love her for the rest his entire life. Having heard his romantic speech, Sarah opens the gate and tells her father she loves Tom and he encourages her to get back with him. As Tom is running, Sarah manages to open the door and Tom catches her just in time. They apologise to each other and tearfully declare their love for one another. Sarah’s family watch them as they forgive each other and begin to accept their relationship. Tom and Sarah agree to give their relationship another go and seal it with a passionate kiss.

<doc id="477386" wikidata="Q1516519" url="?curid=477386" title="Hooverville">
<text>Hoovervilles were shanty towns built during the Great Depression by the homeless in the United States. They were named after Herbert Hoover, who was President of the United States during the onset of the Depression and was widely blamed for it. The term was coined by Charles Michelson. There were hundreds of Hoovervilles across the country during the 1930s.

Homelessness was present before the Great Depression, and was a common sight before 1929. Most large cities built municipal lodging houses for the homeless, but the Depression exponentially increased demand. The homeless clustered in shanty towns close to free soup kitchens. These settlements were often trespassing on private lands, but they were frequently tolerated or ignored out of necessity. Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal enacted special relief programs aimed at the homeless under the Federal Transient Service (FTS) which operated from 1933 to 1939, this did not though mitigate the prevalence of Hoovervilles.

Some of the men who were forced to live in these conditions possessed construction skills, and were able to build their houses out of stone. Most people, however, resorted to building their residences out of wood from crates, cardboard, scraps of metal, or whatever materials were available to them. They usually had a small stove, bedding and a couple of simple cooking implements. Men, women and children alike lived in Hoovervilles. Most of these unemployed residents of the Hoovervilles relied on public charities or begged for food from those who had housing during this era.

Democrats coined other similar terms that were jabs at Herbert Hoover: &quot;Hoover blankets&quot; were old newspapers used as blanketing, a &quot;Hoover flag&quot; was an empty pocket turned inside out, &quot;Hoover leather&quot; was cardboard used to line a shoe when the sole wore through, and a &quot;Hoover wagon&quot; was an automobile with horses hitched to it (often with the engine removed).

After 1940, the economy recovered, unemployment fell, and shanty housing eradication programs destroyed all the Hoovervilles.

== Population of Hoovervilles ==

While some Hoovervilles created a sort of government, most were unorganized collections of shanty houses. This lack of organization has made it difficult to identify the populations within Hoovervilles. Some claim to have been made up of men, women, and children, while others claim to only have had men.

One exceptional Hooverville of Seattle, Washington held a structured government and collected extensive documentation. This Hooverville had its very own unofficial “mayor,” Jesse Jackson. The city of Seattle tolerated the unemployed living situation and imposed loose building and sanitation rules. A request from the city was that women and children would not be allowed to live in the shantytown. This was supervised by “Mayor” Jackson, who also led the Vigilance Committee. Donald Francis Roy, a citizen of Seattle&#x27;s Hooverville, took detailed recordings of the population during his time there. In his journal, he states that of the 639 residents of the town, only 7 of them were women.

However, not every Hooverville fits this description. Photos from shantytowns across the country show images of families, including women and children, dwelling in their makeshift home.

Regardless of the gender of the residents, Hoovervilles served as a common ground for many different nationalities and ethnicities. Economic disparity in the United States during the 1930s was not limited to American born individuals. Migrant workers and immigrants greatly suffered from the lack of work and made up a large portion of the Hoovervilles across the country.

Roy&#x27;s 1934 census provides a breakdown of the population by ethnicity and nationality. His records show populations of Japanese, Mexican, Filipino, Native American, Costa Rican, Chilean, and Black men. Nearly 29 percent of the population was non-white. Among the white population, nationalities included English, Irish, Polish, Spanish, Italian, and Russian.

Roy documents a unique spirit of tolerance and amiability between ethnic groups. He wrote that the racial barriers constructed in ‘normal’ society did not stand within the Hooverville. Black and white men would share homes out of convenience and, likewise, exemplify camaraderie and friendship. Roy noted that only the Filipinos and Mexican men were segregated, generally due to language rather than racial discrimination.

==Notable Hoovervilles==
Among the hundreds of Hoovervilles across the U.S. during the 1930s were those in:
* Anacostia in the District of Columbia: The Bonus Army, a group of World War I veterans seeking expedited benefits, established a Hooverville in 1932. Many of these men came from afar, illegally by riding on railroad freight trains to join the movement. At its maximum there were 15,000 people living there. The camp was demolished by units of the U.S. Army, commanded by Gen. Douglas MacArthur. 
*Central Park, New York City: Scores of homeless families camped out at the Great Lawn at Central Park, then an empty reservoir.
*Riverside Park, New York City: A shantytown occupied Riverside Park at 72nd Street during the depression.
* Seattle had eight Hoovervilles during the 1930s. Its largest Hooverville on the tidal flats adjacent to the Port of Seattle lasted from 1932 to 1941.
* St. Louis in 1930 had the largest Hooverville in America. It consisted of four distinct sectors. St. Louis&#x27;s racially integrated Hooverville depended upon private philanthropy, had an unofficial mayor, created its own churches and other social institutions, and remained a viable community until 1936, when the federal Works Progress Administration allocated slum clearance funds for the area.

==In popular culture==

Hoovervilles have often featured in popular culture, and still appear in editorial cartoons. Movies such as &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; (1936) and &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1941) sometimes sentimentalized Hooverville life.
* Hooverville featured in the 2007 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories &quot;Daleks in Manhattan&quot; and &quot;Evolution of the Daleks&quot;, which were set in 1930 New York. This version of the shanty town was based in Central Park.
* &quot;Man&#x27;s Castle&quot;, a 1933 film directed by Frank Borzage, focuses on a number of down-and-out characters living in a New York City Hooverville; the main characters (played by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young) are lovers who cohabitate in a shanty outfitted with a skylight.
* In &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;, a 1936 screwball comedy, &quot;Forgotten man&quot; Godfrey Smith (played by William Powell) is living in a Hooverville when he is patronised and &quot;adopted&quot; by Irene (Carole Lombard).
* In &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot;, a 1941 comedy film written and directed by Preston Sturges, John L. Sullivan, a wanderlust movie director, played by Joel McCrea, visits a Hooverville and accidentally becomes a genuine tramp.
* The musical &quot;Annie&quot; has a song called &quot;We&#x27;d Like to Thank You, Herbert Hoover&quot;, which takes place in a Hooverville beneath the 59th Street Bridge. In the song, the chorus sings of the hardships they now suffer because of the Great Depression and their contempt for the former president.
* In 1987, the Liverpool group The Christians had a British hit with the song &quot;Hooverville (And They Promised Us The World)&quot;.
* During a temporary housing crisis, the comic strip &quot;Piled Higher and Deeper&quot; refers to a fictional solution to the resulting housing crisis at Stanford University as &quot;Hooverville&quot; due to its proximity to Stanford&#x27;s Hoover Tower.
* The 2005 version of &quot;King Kong&quot;, directed by Peter Jackson, depicts the Hooverville in New York&#x27;s Central Park at the beginning of the film.
* The 2005 movie &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; also referenced the Central Park encampment.
* In the novel &quot;Bud, Not Buddy&quot;, set during the Great Depression, an early scene involves the police dismantling a Hooverville. Bud calls it &quot;Hooperville&quot;.
* In Nelson Algren&#x27;s &quot;A Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, the main character Dove Linkhorn is described as descending from &quot;Forest solitaries spare and swart, left landless as ever in sandland and Hooverville now the time of the forests have passed.&quot;
* In John Steinbeck&#x27;s famous novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, the Joad family briefly settles into a Hooverville in California.
* In Harry Turtledove&#x27;s &quot;Timeline-191&quot; series of books, the equivalent of Hoovervilles in the United States and Confederate States are called Blackfordburghs and Mitcheltowns, respectively, after fictional presidents Hosea Blackford of the US and Burton Mitchel of the CS. The term “Hoovervilles” still exists in this timeline, albeit as a partisan term used by Socialists (who alongside the right-wing Democrats dominate US politics) to highlight their continued existence under President Hoover and to detract from Blackford&#x27;s poor legacy.
* Hoovervilles are part of James Lincoln Collier&#x27;s 2000 history book &quot;The Worst of Times: A Story of the Great Depression&quot;.
* The &quot;Talespin&quot; comic book &quot;The Long Flight Home&quot; portrays a Hooverville filled with anthropomorphic-animals. Kit Cloudkicker was also a resident of it before joining Don Karnage&#x27;s air pirates.
* A Hooverville in Los Angeles plays a prominent role in the second season of the HBO television series &quot;Perry Mason (2020 TV series)&quot;.
* &quot;Hooverville (And They Promised Us the World)&quot;, was the second single by the UK pop band, The Christians (band). It reached no. 22 in the UK singles chart in 1987, and also featured on their million-selling album, &quot;The Christians (album)&quot;, which reached no. 2 in the UK album charts.

<text>Harold Sydney Bride (11 January 1890 – 29 April 1956) was a British merchant seaman and the junior wireless operator on the ocean liner during her ill-fated maiden voyage.

After the &quot;Titanic&quot; struck an iceberg at 11:40 pm 14 April 1912, Bride and his senior colleague, Jack Phillips, were responsible for relaying CQD messages to ships in the vicinity and coordinating the rescue effort which led to survivors being picked up by the . The pair remained at their posts until the ship&#x27;s power was almost completely out.

Bride was washed off the ship as the boat deck flooded, but managed to scramble onto the upturned lifeboat Collapsible &#x27;B&#x27;, and was rescued by &quot;Carpathia&quot; later in the morning. Despite being injured, he helped Harold Cottam, the &quot;Carpathia&quot; wireless operator and a personal friend of his, transmit survivor lists and personal messages from the ship.

==Early life==
Harold Bride was born in Nunhead, London, England, in 1890 to Arthur Bride and Mary Ann Lowe. The youngest of five children, Bride lived with his family in Bromley. Between 1903 and 1922 the family lived in Ravensbourne Avenue, Shortlands and is commemorated with a blue plaque. After primary school, Bride decided he wanted to become a wireless operator and he worked in his family&#x27;s business to help pay for training. He completed training for the Marconi Company in July 1911. Working for Marconi, his first sea assignment as a wireless operator was on the ; later he worked on the &quot;Beaverford&quot;, the &quot;LaFrance&quot;, the &quot;Lusitania&quot;, and the &quot;Anselm&quot;.

==RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;==

In 1912 Bride joined the crew of the as the junior wireless operator and assistant to Jack Phillips at Belfast, Ireland. Stories have appeared that Bride knew Phillips before the &quot;Titanic&quot;, but Bride stated that they had never met before Belfast. The &quot;Titanic&quot; left on her maiden voyage to New York City from Southampton, England, on 10 April. During the voyage, Bride and Phillips worked from the wireless room on the Boat Deck, sending out passengers&#x27; personal messages and receiving iceberg warnings from other ships. On 11 April, one day after the ship set sail, Phillips and Bride celebrated Phillips&#x27; 25th birthday, with pastries brought from the first-class dining room.

On the evening of 14 April 1912 Bride had gone to bed early in preparation to relieve Phillips at midnight, two hours earlier than normal. The wireless had not been working earlier and Phillips was busy catching up on a backlog of passengers&#x27; personal messages being sent to Cape Race, Newfoundland.

The &quot;Titanic&quot; hit the iceberg at 11:40 pm that night and began sinking. Bride woke up shortly after and asked Phillips what was happening. Phillips said they had struck something; Bride acknowledged Phillips and began to get ready to go on duty. Captain Edward Smith soon came into the wireless room alerting Bride and Phillips to be ready to send out a distress signal. Shortly after midnight, Smith came in and told them to request help and gave them the ship&#x27;s position.

Phillips sent out CQD while Bride took messages to the Captain about which ships were coming to the &quot;Titanic&quot; assistance. However, the closest ship to respond, the , would not reach the &quot;Titanic&quot; until after she sank. At one point Bride reminded Phillips that the new code was SOS and jokingly said, &quot;Send SOS, it&#x27;s the new call, and it may be your last chance to send it.&quot; Later Phillips took a quick break and Bride took over the wireless. Phillips soon returned to the wireless room reporting that the forward part of the ship was flooded and that they should put on more clothes and life vests. Bride began to get dressed while Phillips went back to work on the wireless machine.

The wireless power was almost out when Captain Smith arrived and told the men that they had done their duty and that they were relieved. Phillips continued working while Bride gathered some money and personal belongings. Bride later remembered being moved by the way Phillips continued working. When his back was turned a crew member had sneaked in and was taking Phillips&#x27; life vest. Bride, outraged at the man&#x27;s behaviour, attacked the man and might have hit him with an object. The water was beginning to flood the wireless room as they both ran out of the wireless room, leaving the motionless crewman where he fell. Bride thought the man was &quot;a stoker, or someone from below decks&quot;. Bride wrote later: &quot;I did my duty. I hope I finished [the man]. I don&#x27;t know. We left him on the cabin floor of the radio room, and he was not moving.&quot; The men then split up, Bride heading forward and Phillips heading aft. This was the last time Bride saw Phillips.

Bride began helping remove one of the last two lifeboats, Collapsible B, off the roof of the officers&#x27; quarters. The crew was unable to launch the boat before it was washed off the deck upside down. Bride was also washed off the deck and found himself in the sea beneath the overturned boat. He swam out from under and climbed onto the boat, on which he and around 30 other people were able to survive. Throughout the night, under Charles Lightoller&#x27;s command, Bride and the others on the overturned lifeboat learned to shift their weight with swells to keep the boat afloat for as long as possible, although the collapsible was waterlogged and slowly sinking. Bride and the others on B were later assisted into other lifeboats and were eventually taken aboard the RMS &quot;Carpathia&quot;.

On the &quot;Carpathia&quot;, the seriously injured Bride rested, and later helped the &quot;Carpathia&quot;&#x27;s wireless operator, Harold Cottam, send out the large number of personal messages from the survivors. According to &quot;Encyclopedia Titanica&quot;: &quot;Incidentally, Bride and Cottam had met before the disaster and were good friends. After the tragedy they stayed in contact for many years.&quot;

==&quot;Titanic&quot; inquiries==
Bride, who had to be carried off the &quot;Carpathia&quot; because of injuries to his feet (one was badly sprained, the other foot frostbitten), was met in New York City by Guglielmo Marconi and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which gave Bride $1,000 () for his exclusive story, &quot;Thrilling Story by Titanic&#x27;s Surviving Wireless Man&quot;. Bride later gave testimony in the American and British inquiries into the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster, describing what iceberg warnings had been received and what had happened the night of the disaster.

In the American inquiry, Bride was also questioned about ignoring requests for information, while on the &quot;Carpathia&quot;, from the press and the United States Navy, which wanted to know the fate of President Taft&#x27;s personal friend and aide Archibald Butt. Bride stated that priority had been given to personal messages and survivor lists over answering questions from the press and claimed that the Navy did not understand British Morse signals, which the Navy denied. The Marconi Company was accused of secretly setting up &quot;The New York Times&quot; interview with Bride and telling him and Harold Cottam to keep quiet until they arrived in New York, but Marconi denied the accusations. This matter was not pursued, and Bride was considered one of the heroes of the disaster.

==Later life==
Before sailing on the &quot;Titanic&quot;, on 16 March 1912 he became engaged to Mabel Ludlow, but he broke off the engagement in September when he met Lucy Downie, whom he married on 10 April 1920. The couple had three children together: two daughters, Lucy and Jeanette, and a son, John.

In August 1912, London via Melbourne records show Bride being aboard the SS &quot;Medina&quot; as a Marconi operator. During World War I, Bride served as the wireless operator on the steamship &quot;Mona&#x27;s Isle&quot;.

Despite being a key witness in the inquiries, Bride kept a low profile after the sinking. He rarely discussed the tragic events of 14-15 April 1912 and the loss of his colleague Phillips deeply affected him. Eventually, to escape the &quot;celebrity&quot; of being a &quot;Titanic&quot; survivor, he moved with his family to Glasgow, Scotland where he worked as a travelling salesman for a pharmaceutical company. Later, he became the caretaker of Provan Hall, courtesy of the National Trust of Scotland.

===Death===
Bride died on 29 April 1956, aged 66, from lung cancer at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow. His body was cremated at Glasgow Crematorium and his ashes were scattered in the garden of the crematorium&#x27;s chapel.

<doc id="477404" wikidata="Q87080" url="?curid=477404" title="Bernhard Rothmann">
<text>Bernhard Rothmann (also Bernd or Berndt; c. 1495 – c. 1535) was a 16th-century radical and Anabaptist leader in the city of Münster. He was born in Stadtlohn, Westphalia, around 1495.

==Life==
In the late 1520s Bernard Rothmann became the leader for religious reform in the city of Münster. In his sermons he condemned Catholic doctrines such as purgatory and the use of images, as well as the low morals of the priests. He suffered censure of the Catholic bishop in 1531, and afterwards denied the authority of the Catholic Church and openly aligned himself with the Reformed faith. In January 1532, he published an evangelical creed, and gained the backing of the city authorities. In the treaty of 14 February 1533, Münster was recognized as a Lutheran city. In the summer of 1533, Rothmann was converted by the Anabaptist disciples of Melchior Hoffman to &quot;anti-pedobaptism&quot;. He began to preach against infant baptism from his pulpit at St. Lambert&#x27;s church. Though censured by the city council, he remained safe through his popularity with the craft guilds. Rothmann strengthened his standing by gaining more converts to his position.

When Melchior Hoffman was imprisoned in Strasbourg, Jan Matthys took over the Anabaptist leadership role in the Low Countries. He declared Münster to be the place to which Jesus Christ would return and set up his kingdom. In January 1534, Matthys sent disciples to Münster to declare the city as the &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;, and quickly baptized numerous converts, including Bernhard Rothmann. Rothmann was baptized on 5 January 1534.

Matthys arrived in Münster in February 1534. His &quot;rule&quot; of the city set the stage for the events usually called the Münster rebellion. While Matthys was the prophet and leader, Rothmann was probably the most important &quot;theological voice&quot;. Matthys died in a failed military attempt on Easter Sunday 1534. John of Leiden thereafter became King of Münster until its fall in June 1535. Rothmann may have died fighting during the reconquest of Münster, or may have escaped during the turmoil. His body was not identified, but he was apparently not among the only group of surviving Anabaptist fighters — a small band around Heinrich Krechting — that contemporary sources attest to, and unlike Krechting&#x27;s men, Rothmann was never heard from again.

==Theology==
===Baptism===
Unlike many of the 16th-century Anabaptists, Rothmann held immersion to be the proper mode of baptism. According to historian Darren T. Williamson, &quot;He based his position primarily on three arguments: first, he argued along grammatical lines, not Greek grammar but Dutch/German. He contended that the meaning of the Dutch translation of baptism must be taken literally. Fortunately, the Dutch words &quot;doepen&quot; and &quot;dumpelen&quot; meant literally to immerse or &#x27;dunk in water&#x27;. It is important to note that although Rothmann was technically correct on this point of grammar, it was also as commonly understood that there was a long standing theological exception as practiced by the church, namely sprinkling. Second, the Scriptural explanations of baptism in such passages as Rom 6:3-4 (baptism = burial), Col 2:11-13 (baptism = burial), and 1 Pet 3:21 (baptism = washing of the body, or bath) graphically describe an immersion. Third, he cited a few ancient authorities, Tertullian, Origen, Gratian&#x27;s &quot;Decretum&quot;, and &quot;Beatus Rhenanus&quot; (by which he meant collections of ancient texts edited by Rhenanus, a contemporary of Rothmann), who at least to some degree supported directly or indirectly adult baptism and immersion.&quot;

===Bible===
Rothmann accepted the entire Bible as the word of God. In his &quot;Restitution&quot; he wrote, &quot;The divine, unquestionably Holy Scriptures which are called the Bible alone have the fame that they are needful and sufficient for teaching reproof, correction and for instruction in righteousness for which purpose also almighty God has given them in order that the man of God be without error and equipped for every good work. Since the apostasy first began through human writing and teaching by means of which the divine Scriptures were darkened the Almighty has among us provided that all writings both new and old which are not biblical should he destroyed so that we should cling only to the Holy Scriptures.&quot;

===Christology===
The Christology that Rothmann held was the &quot;celestial flesh&quot; idea of Kaspar Schwenkfeld and Melchior Hoffman (and later of Menno Simons). See Theology of Anabaptism.

===Church===
Rothmann believed the church to be a congregation of only baptized believers. In his &quot;Confession&quot; he wrote, &quot;The church of Christ is a gathering of the believing children of God who praise the name of God. No one else belongs in it...The Scriptures richly testify that faith comes from hearing the Word and that the holy church be built only of those who believe. It cannot be denied that the true proclamation of the holy gospel started the holy church...The second thing through which the holy church is built is holy baptism. Baptism is the entry and gateway to the holy church; therefore according to God&#x27;s order no one may be allowed into the church except through baptism.&quot;

===Polygamy===
Rothmann initially opposed the polygamy introduced to Münster by John of Leiden, but would later write in theological defense of the idea. He wrote, &quot;God has restored the true practice of holy matrimony amongst us.&quot; &quot;Marriage is the union of man and wife - &#x27;one&#x27; has now been removed - for the honor of God and to fulfill his will, so that children might be brought up in the fear of God.&quot; &quot;This was true of the biblical fathers until the time of the Apostles, nor has polygamy been forbidden by God,&quot; he said. Rothmann based the legitimacy of the practice on a greater emphasis on the Old Testament than was common among most Anabaptists, as well as the Anabaptist view of marriage for the purpose of procreation.

==Legacy==
Rothmann influenced the south German Anabaptists through Pilgram Marpeck, who borrowed some of his &quot;Vermanung&quot; from Rothmann&#x27;s &quot;Bekenntnisse&quot; of 1533. He was part of the earliest movement, as a disciple of Melchior Hoffman, that laid the foundations of Anabaptism in the Netherlands and northern Germany. Rothmann&#x27;s view of the incarnation would be the predominant view among Dutch Anabaptists in their first century of history (though Hoffman is much more the source).

<doc id="477405" wikidata="Q4862544" url="?curid=477405" title="Baron Kingsale">
<text>Baron Kingsale is a title of the premier baron in the Peerage of Ireland. The feudal barony dates to at least the thirteenth century. The first peerage creation was by writ.
== Name and precedence ==
In the early times the name was &quot;Kinsale&quot; or &quot;Kinsale and Ringrone&quot;, but the spelling Kingsale has imposed itself with time and Ringrone was dropped. Regarding its precedence among the Irish baronies, the title Baron Athenry was considered the eldest and Kingsale held the second rank. However, in 1799 Athenry became dormant (and probably extinct) and Kingsale was elevated to premier Baron in Ireland.

















== Numbering ==
The literature usually numbers the successive barons to avoid confusion arising from the repetitions of the same names, such as Miles or John de Courcy in the long line of the barons of Kingsale. Two such schemes are in common use, often both are cited together, e.g. Almeric de Courcy 18th (or 23rd) Baron. The older scheme numbers all the barons starting with Miles de Courcy, who was granted the baronies of Kingsale and Ringrone by Henry III in 1223. This scheme dates from Lodge in 1754. An alternative numbering was introduced by Cokayne in 1929 with the second version of The Complete Peerage. It excludes the early barons, that it considers feudal, and starts with Miles, who died in 1344, accepted as the first peer. This article follows the older numbering, considered more common.

== Hat trick ==
The barons traditionally claimed the privilege of remaining covered (that is, wearing a hat) in the presence of the monarch. It was supposed to have been obtained from King John by John de Courcy and handed down to his heirs. As far as is known, the right has been exercised for the first time by Almeric de Courcy, 23rd Baron Kingsale before William III in 1692. His successor Gerald de Courcy, 24th Baron Kingsale repeated the hat trick before George I in 1720 and George II on 22 June 1727. The Eleventh Edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, however, states that the privilege &quot;is a legend without historic foundation&quot;.

== Castles ==
* Kilbrittain Castle once belonged to the De Courcys but was lost to Donal Gott MacCarthy, King of Desmond, whose son Donal Maol MacCarthy Reagh was the first King of Carbery and founder of the MacCarthy Reagh dynasty.
* Coolmain Castle
* Old Head Castle

== Decline ==
Despite the antiquity of the title, the family no longer retains its property or wealth, having supported the losing side in past conflicts. The 30th (or 35th) Baron, despite education at Stowe and the Universities of Paris and Salzburg, supported by his father&#x27;s marriage to the daughter of a Yorkshire lanolin oil business owner, was, due to the later failure of that business amongst other things, an odd-job man and plumber, and died a resident of sheltered housing.

The person currently entitled to hold the title is Nevinson Mark de Courcy, who was born in 1958 and lives in Remuera, Auckland, New Zealand. He is or would be the 31st (or 36th) Baron, however, his name does not appear in the current Roll of the Peerage. Under the terms of the Royal Warrant of 2004, any person who succeeds to a Peerage must prove his or her succession and be placed on the Roll, otherwise, that person may not be recognised as a peer legally or in official documents in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="477417" wikidata="Q834470" url="?curid=477417" title="Sportive lemur">
<text>The sportive lemurs are the medium-sized primates that make up the family Lepilemuridae. The family consists of only one extant genus, Lepilemur. They are closely related to the other lemurs and exclusively live on the island of Madagascar. For a time, this family was named Megaladapidae, but the current name was given precedence since the extinct genus &quot;Megaladapis&quot; was removed from the family.

==Etymology==
French zoologist Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire first described the genus &quot;Lepilemur&quot; in 1851, prefixing the existing genus &quot;Lemur&quot; with the Latin &quot;lepidus&quot; (&quot;pleasant&quot; or &quot;pretty&quot;). However, it was erroneously spelled—a mistake later authors unsuccessfully attempted to correct to &quot;Lepidolemur&quot;. Members of the monogeneric family Lepilemuridae are referred to as either sportive or weasel lemurs. &quot;Sportive lemur&quot;, which is more commonly used, was coined by Henry Ogg Forbes in 1894. Though he did not explain the name choice, he did mention the agility of &quot;Lepilemur&quot;. &quot;Weasel lemur&quot; is an older common name, dating to the 1863 publication of &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Popular National History&quot;. Dunkel &quot;et al.&quot; speculated that was inspired by the species name &quot;L. mustelinus&quot;, which means &quot;weasel-like&quot; in Latin. They were named &quot;weasel lemurs&quot; for their swiftness like that of mustelids.

==Physical characteristics==

Their fur is grey brown or reddish colored on the top and whitish yellow underneath. They typically have a short head with large, round ears. They grow to a length of (with a tail just about as long as their body) and weigh up to . Their eyes have a tapetum lucidum behind the retina, hence they have eyeshine.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Sportive lemurs are strictly nocturnal and predominantly arboreal, moving among the trees with long jumps powered by their strong hind legs. On the ground, they hop similarly to the kangaroo. During the day they hide in leafy covering or tree hollows. Sportive lemurs are mostly solitary and defend their territory against same sex intruders. The territories of males and females can overlap.

They are mainly herbivores and their diet consists predominantly of leaves.

Birthing happens between September and December after a gestation of 120 to 150 days, and is usually of a single young which is often reared in a nest in a tree hollow. At about four months the juveniles are weaned but remain with their mother up to an age of one year. At about 18 months they are fully mature, and live to be about eight years old.
