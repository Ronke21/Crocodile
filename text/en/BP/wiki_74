<text>USS &quot;Buchanan&quot; (DD-131), named for Franklin Buchanan, was a in the United States Navy.

&quot;Buchanan&quot; was transferred to the United Kingdom under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement in 1940 and served as [[HMS Campbeltown (I42)|HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; (I42)]]. She was destroyed during the St. Nazaire Raid: at 1:34 on 28 March 1942, loaded with four tons of amatol explosive, the ship rammed the gates of the &quot;Forme Ecluse Louis Joubert&quot; dry dock. The ship exploded the following morning, ending the use of the dock for the rest of the war.

==Service with the United States Navy==
The first USS &quot;Buchanan&quot; (DD-131) was launched on 2 January 1919 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. Charles P. Wetherbee. The ship was commissioned on 20 January 1919. &quot;Buchanan&quot; reported to Commander, Destroyer Force, at Guantanamo, Cuba, and was temporarily attached to Destroyer Squadron 2 until ordered to the Pacific Fleet in July 1919 for duty with Destroyer Flotilla 4. From 7 June 1922 until 10 April 1930 &quot;Buchanan&quot; was out of commission at San Diego. She then joined Destroyer Division 10, Destroyer Squadrons, Battle Force, and operated on the West Coast in routine division, force, and fleet activities and problems. It was for this short period that she was commanded by Theodore E. Chandler, who would later become an admiral during World War II and be killed in action in the South Pacific in January 1945. In mid-1934, after making a cruise to Alaska with ROTC units aboard, she was placed in reduced commission attached to Rotating Reserve Destroyer Squadron 20 at San Diego.

Again placed in full commission in December 1934, she resumed operations with Division 5, Destroyers, Battle Force. &quot;Buchanan&quot; was again out of commission at San Diego from 9 April 1937 until 30 September 1939 at which time she was refitted for action with Division 65, Destroyer Squadron 32, Atlantic Squadron. From December 1939 until 22 February 1940, she operated with the Neutrality Patrol and Antilles Detachment. She was then assigned to patrol in the Gulf of Mexico, operating out of Galveston, Texas and later off Key West and around the Florida Straits. She arrived at Boston Navy Yard on 2 September and then proceeded to Halifax, where on 9 September 1940 she was decommissioned and transferred to the United Kingdom under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement.

==Service with the Royal Navy - HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; (I42)==

Upon her arrival at HMNB Devonport, England, on 29 September 1940, HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was allocated to the 7th Escort Group, Liverpool, in the Western Approaches Command. In January 1941 she was provisionally allocated to the Royal Netherlands Navy, but reverted to the Royal Navy in September 1941. Between September 1941 and March 1942 she served with Atlantic convoys and was attacked on several occasions by enemy U-boats and aircraft, but escaped without damage. On 15 September 1941 she picked up the survivors of the Norwegian motor tanker &quot;Vinga&quot;, damaged by an enemy air attack.

===Saint-Nazaire Raid===


In 1942, the anchored at Trondheim in Norway was considered to present a grave threat to Atlantic convoys. However, should the ship enter the Atlantic then the dry dock originally built for the ocean liner in the German-occupied port of Saint-Nazaire, France, was the only one in German hands on the Atlantic seaboard large enough to hold her. It was considered that if this dock could be put out of action, then a sortie by &quot;Tirpitz&quot; into the Atlantic would be much more dangerous for her, and probably not worth the risk. The obsolete &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was selected for the task, and cosmetic modifications quickly done to make her look similar to a German &quot;Möwe&quot;-class torpedo boat.

Using genuine German recognition signals, the force approached to within less than a mile of the harbour before they were fired upon, &quot;Campbeltown&quot; as the largest target drawing most of the fire. At 01:34 on 28 March 1942, &quot;Campbeltown&quot; rammed the dock gate four minutes later than planned. Troops and crew came ashore under heavy German fire and set about demolishing the dock machinery. 169 of the raiders were killed (64 commandos and 105 sailors) out of the 611 men in the attacking force. Of the survivors, 215 were captured and 222 were evacuated by the surviving small craft. A further five evaded capture and travelled overland through France to Spain and then to Gibraltar.

The charges in &quot;Campbeltown&quot; exploded the next day, 28 March, an hour and a half after the latest time that the British had expected them to detonate. Although the ship had been searched by the Germans, the explosives had not been detected. The explosion killed around 250 German soldiers and French civilians and demolished both the front half of the ship and the 160-ton caisson, the inrush of water into the dock washing the remains of the ship into it. The dock was rendered unusable for the rest of the war, and was not repaired until 1948.

==Ship&#x27;s bell==
The bell was given to Campbelltown, Pennsylvania as a gesture of appreciation towards the United States for the Lend-Lease programme. It was lent by the town to the current , a Type 22 frigate, when it was commissioned in 1989, and remained on the ship whilst it was in service with the Royal Navy. The bell was returned to the town on 21 June 2011 when HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was decommissioned.

==Films==
The 1952 film &quot;Gift Horse&quot; and the 1968 film &quot;Attack on the Iron Coast&quot; were both loosely based on the story of HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot;.

<doc id="481484" wikidata="Q1625709" url="?curid=481484" title="Wood preservation">
<text>Wood easily degrades without sufficient preservation. Apart from structural wood preservation measures, there are a number of different chemical preservatives and processes (also known as timber treatment, lumber treatment or pressure treatment) that can extend the life of wood, timber, and their associated products, including engineered wood. These generally increase the durability and resistance from being destroyed by insects or fungi.

==History==

As proposed by Richardson, treatment of wood has been practiced for almost as long as the use of wood itself. There are records of wood preservation reaching back to ancient Greece during Alexander the Great&#x27;s rule, where bridge wood was soaked in olive oil. The Romans protected their ship hulls by brushing the wood with tar. During the Industrial Revolution, wood preservation became a cornerstone of the wood processing industry. Inventors and scientists such as Bethell, Boucherie, Burnett and Kyan made historic developments in wood preservation, with the preservative solutions and processes. Commercial pressure treatment began in the latter half of the 19th century with the protection of railroad cross-ties using creosote. Treated wood was used primarily for industrial, agricultural, and utility applications, where it is still used, until its use grew considerably (at least in the United States) in the 1970s, as homeowners began building decks and backyard projects. Innovation in treated timber products continues to this day, with consumers becoming more interested in less toxic materials.

==Hazards==
Wood that has been industrially pressure-treated with approved preservative products poses a limited risk to the public and should be disposed of properly. On December 31, 2003, the U.S. wood treatment industry stopped treating residential lumber with arsenic and chromium (chromated copper arsenate, or CCA). This was a voluntary agreement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency. CCA was replaced by copper-based pesticides, with exceptions for certain industrial uses. CCA may still be used for outdoor products like utility trailer beds and non-residential construction like piers, docks, and agricultural buildings. Industrial wood preservation chemicals are generally not available directly to the public and may require special approval to import or purchase, depending on the product and the jurisdiction where being used. In most countries, industrial wood preservation operations are notifiable industrial activities that require licensing from relevant regulatory authorities such as EPA or equivalent. Reporting and licensing conditions vary widely, depending on the particular chemicals used and the country of use.

Although pesticides are used to treat lumber, preserving lumber protects natural resources (in the short term) by enabling wood products to last longer. Previous poor practices in industry have left legacies of contaminated ground and water around wood treatment sites in some cases. However, under currently approved industry practices and regulatory controls, such as implemented in Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and elsewhere, environmental impact of these operations should be minimal.

Wood treated with modern preservatives is generally safe to handle, given appropriate handling precautions and personal protection measures. However, treated wood may present certain hazards in some circumstances, such as during combustion or where loose wood dust particles or other fine toxic residues are generated, or where treated wood comes into direct contact with food and agriculture.

Preservatives containing copper in the form of microscopic particles have recently been introduced to the market, usually with &quot;micronized&quot; or &quot;micro&quot; trade names and designations such as MCQ or MCA. The manufacturers represent that these products are safe and EPA has registered these products.

The American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) recommends that all treated wood be accompanied by a Consumer Information Sheet (CIS), to communicate safe handling and disposal instructions, as well as potential health and environmental hazards of treated wood. Many producers have opted to provide Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) instead. Although the practice of distributing MSDS instead of CIS is widespread, there is an ongoing debate regarding the practice and how to best communicate potential hazards and hazard mitigation to the end-user. Neither MSDS nor the newly adopted International Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are required for treated lumber under current U.S. Federal law.

==Chemical==
Chemical preservatives can be classified into three broad categories: 
* water-borne preservatives
* oil-borne preservatives 
* light organic solvent preservatives (LOSPs).

===Micronized copper===
Particulate (micronised or dispersed) copper preservative technology has been introduced in the US and Europe. In these systems, copper is ground into micro sized particles and suspended in water rather than dissolved, as is the case with other copper products such as ACQ and copper azole. There are two particulate copper systems in production. One system uses a quat biocide system (known as MCQ) and is a derivative of ACQ. The other uses an azole biocide (known as MCA or μCA-C) derived from copper azole.

Two particulate copper systems, one marketed as MicroPro and the other as Wolmanized using μCA-C formulation, have achieved Environmentally Preferable Product (EPP) certification. The &quot;EPP&quot; certification was issued by Scientific Certifications Systems (SCS) and is based on a comparative life-cycle impact assessments with an industry standard.

The copper particle size used in the &quot;micronized&quot; copper beads ranges from 1 to 700 nm with an average under 300 nm. Larger particles (such as actual micron-scale particles) of copper do not adequately penetrate the wood cell walls. These micronized preservatives use nano particles of copper oxide or copper carbonate, for which there are alleged safety concerns. An environmental group petitioned EPA in 2011 to revoke the registration of the micronized copper products, citing safety issues.

====Alkaline copper quaternary====
Alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ) is a preservative made of copper, a fungicide, and a quaternary ammonium compound (quat) like didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, an insecticide which also augments the fungicidal treatment. ACQ has come into wide use in the US, Europe, Japan and Australia following restrictions on CCA. Its use is governed by national and international standards, which determine the volume of preservative uptake required for a specific timber end use.

Since it contains high levels of copper, ACQ-treated timber is five times more corrosive to common steel. It is necessary to use fasteners meeting or exceeding requirements for ASTM A 153 Class D, such as ceramic-coated, as mere galvanized and even common grades of stainless steel corrode. The U.S. began mandating the use of non-arsenic containing wood preservatives for virtually all residential use timber in 2004.

The American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) standards for ACQ require a retention of for above ground use and for ground contact.

Chemical Specialties, Inc (CSI, now Viance) received U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 2002 for commercial introduction of ACQ. Its widespread use has eliminated major quantities of arsenic and chromium previously contained in CCA.

====Copper azole====
Copper azole preservative (denoted as CA-B and CA-C under American Wood Protection Association/AWPA standards) is a major copper based wood preservative that has come into wide use in Canada, the US, Europe, Japan and Australia following restrictions on CCA. Its use is governed by national and international standards, which determine the volume of preservative uptake required for a specific timber end use.

Copper azole is similar to ACQ with the difference being that the dissolved copper preservative is augmented by an azole co-biocide like organic triazoles such as tebuconazole or propiconazole, which are also used to protect food crops, instead of the quat biocide used in ACQ. The azole co-biocide yields a copper azole product that is effective at lower retentions than required for equivalent ACQ performance. The general appearance of wood treated with copper azole preservative is similar to CCA with a green colouration.

Copper azole treated wood is marketed widely under the &quot;Preserve CA&quot; and &quot;Wolmanized&quot; brands in North America, and the &quot;Tanalith&quot; brand across Europe and other international markets.

The AWPA standard retention for CA-B is for above ground applications and for ground contact applications. Type C copper azole, denoted as CA-C, has been introduced under the Wolmanized and Preserve brands. The AWPA standard retention for CA-C is for above ground applications and for ground contact applications.

===Copper naphthenate===
Copper naphthenate, invented in Denmark in 1911, has been used effectively for many applications including: fencepost, canvas, nets, greenhouses, utility poles, railroad ties, beehives, and wooden structures in ground contact. Copper naphthenate is registered with the EPA as a non-restricted use pesticide, so there is no federal applicators licensing requirements for its use as a wood preservative. Copper Naphthenate can be applied by brush, dip, or pressure treatment.

The University of Hawaii has found that copper naphthenate in wood at loadings of is resistant to Formosan termite attack. On February 19, 1981, the Federal Register outlined the EPA&#x27;s position regarding the health risks associated with various wood preservatives. As a result, the National Park Service recommended the use of copper naphthenate in its facilities as an approved substitute for pentachlorophenol, creosote, and inorganic arsenicals. A 50-year study presented to AWPA in 2005 by Mike Freeman and Douglas Crawford says, &quot;This study reassessed the condition of the treated wood posts in southern Mississippi, and statistically calculated the new expected post life span. It was determined that commercial wood preservatives, like pentachlorophenol in oil, creosote, and copper naphthenate in oil, provided excellent protection for posts, with life spans now calculated to exceed 60 years. Surprisingly, creosote and penta treated posts at 75% of the recommended AWPA retention, and copper naphthenate at 50% of the required AWPA retention, gave excellent performance in this AWPA Hazard Zone 5 site. Untreated southern pine posts lasted 2 years in this test site.&quot;

The AWPA M4 Standard for the care of preservative-treated wood products, reads, &quot;The appropriateness of the preservation system for field treatment shall be determined by the type of preservative originally used to protect the product and the availability of a field treatment preservative. Because many preservative products are not packaged and labeled for use by the general public, a system different from the original treatment may need to be utilized for field treatment. Users shall carefully read and follow the instructions and precautions listed on the product label when using these materials. Copper naphthenate preservatives containing a minimum of 2.0% copper metal are recommended for material originally treated with copper naphthenate, pentachlorophenol, creosote, creosote solution or waterborne preservatives.&quot; The M4 Standard has been adopted by the International Code Council&#x27;s (ICC) 2015 International Building Code (IBC) section 2303.1.9 Preservative-treated Wood, and 2015 International Residential Code (IRC) R317.1.1 Field Treatment. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials AASHTO has also adopted the AWPA M4 Standard.

A waterborne copper naphthenate is sold to consumers under the tradename QNAP 5W. Oilborne copper naphthenates with 1% copper as metal solutions are sold to consumers under the tradenames Copper Green, and Wolmanized Copper Coat, a 2% copper as metal solution is sold under the tradename Tenino.

===Chromated copper arsenate (CCA)===

In CCA treatment, copper is the primary fungicide, arsenic is a secondary fungicide and an insecticide, and chromium is a fixative which also provides ultraviolet (UV) light resistance. Recognized for the greenish tint it imparts to timber, CCA is a preservative that was very common for many decades.

In the pressure treatment process, an aqueous solution of CCA is applied using a vacuum and pressure cycle, and the treated wood is then stacked to dry. During the process, the mixture of oxides reacts to form insoluble compounds, helping with leaching problems.

The process can apply varying amounts of preservative at varying levels of pressure to protect the wood against increasing levels of attack. Increasing protection can be applied (in increasing order of attack and treatment) for: exposure to the atmosphere, implantation within soil, or insertion into a marine environment.

In the last decade concerns were raised that the chemicals may leach from the wood into surrounding soil, resulting in concentrations higher than naturally occurring background levels. A study cited in &quot;Forest Products Journal&quot; found 12–13% of the chromated copper arsenate leached from treated wood buried in compost during a 12-month period. Once these chemicals have leached from the wood, they are likely to bind to soil particles, especially in soils with clay or soils that are more alkaline than neutral. In the United States the US Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a report in 2002 stating that exposure to arsenic from direct human contact with CCA treated wood may be higher than was previously thought. On 1 January 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a voluntary agreement with industry began restricting the use of CCA in treated timber in residential and commercial construction, with the exception of shakes and shingles, permanent wood foundations, and certain commercial applications. This was in an effort to reduce the use of arsenic and improve environmental safety, although the EPA were careful to point out that they had not concluded that CCA treated wood structures in service posed an unacceptable risk to the community. The EPA did not call for the removal or dismantling of existing CCA treated wood structures.

In Australia, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) restricted the use of CCA preservative for treatment of timber used in certain applications from March 2006. CCA may no longer be used to treat wood used in &#x27;intimate human contact&#x27; applications such as children&#x27;s play equipment, furniture, residential decking and handrailing. Use for low contact residential, commercial and industrial applications remains unrestricted, as does its use in all other situations. The APVMA decision to restrict the use of CCA in Australia was a precautionary measure, even though the report found no evidence that demonstrated CCA treated timber posed unreasonable risks to humans in normal use. Similarly to the US EPA, the APVMA did not recommend dismantling or removal of existing CCA treated wood structures.

In Europe, Directive 2003/2/EC restricts the marketing and use of arsenic, including CCA wood treatment. CCA treated wood is not permitted to be used in residential or domestic constructions. It is permitted for use in various industrial and public works, such as bridges, highway safety fencing, electric power transmission and telecommunications poles.
In the United Kingdom waste timber treated with CCA was classified in July 2012 as hazardous waste by the department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

===Other copper compounds===
These include copper HDO (Bis-(N-cyclohexyldiazeniumdioxy)-copper or CuHDO), copper chromate, copper citrate, acid copper chromate, and ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate (ACZA). The CuHDO treatment is an alternative to CCA, ACQ and CA used in Europe and in approval stages for United States and Canada. ACZA is generally used for marine applications.

===Borate===
Boric acid, oxides and salts (borates) are effective wood preservatives and are supplied under numerous brand names throughout the world. One of the most common compounds used is disodium octaborate tetrahydrate , commonly abbreviated DOT. Borate treated wood is of low toxicity to humans, and does not contain copper or other heavy metals. However, unlike most other preservatives, borate compounds do not become fixed in the wood and can be partially leached out if exposed repeatedly to water that flows away rather than evaporating (evaporation leaves the borate behind so is not a problem). Even though leaching will not normally reduce boron concentrations below effective levels for preventing fungal growth, borates should not be used where they will be exposed to repeated rain, water or ground contact unless the exposed surfaces are treated to repel water. Zinc-borate compounds are less susceptible to leaching than sodium-borate compounds, but are still not recommended for below-ground use unless the timber is first sealed. Recent interest in low toxicity timber for residential use, along with new regulations restricting some wood preservation agents, has resulted in a resurgence of the use of borate treated wood for floor beams and internal structural members. Researchers at CSIRO in Australia have developed organoborates which are much more resistant to leaching, while still providing timber with good protection from termite and fungal attack. The cost of the production of these modified borates will limit their widespread take-up but they are likely to be suitable for certain niche applications, especially where low mammalian toxicity is of paramount importance.

===PTI===
Recent concerns about the health and environmental effects of metallic wood preservatives have created a market interest in non-metallic wood preservatives such as propiconazole-tebuconazole-imidacloprid better known as PTI. The American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) standards for PTI require a retention of for above ground use and when applied in combination with a wax stabilizer. The AWPA has not developed a standard for a PTI ground contact preservative, so PTI is currently limited to above ground applications such as decks. All three of the PTI components are also used in food crop applications. The very low required amounts of PTI in pressure treated wood further limits effects and substantially decreases the freight costs and associated environmental impacts for shipping preservative components to the pressure treating plants.

The PTI preservative imparts very little color to the wood. Producers generally add a color agent or a trace amount of copper solution so as to identify the wood as pressure treated and to better match the color of other pressure treated wood products. The PTI wood products are very well adapted for paint and stain applications with no bleed-through. The addition of the wax stabilizer allows a lower preservative retention plus substantially reduces the tendency of wood to warp and split as it dries. In combination with normal deck maintenance and sealer applications, the stabilizer helps maintain appearance and performance over time. PTI pressure treated wood products are no more corrosive than untreated wood and are approved for all types of metal contact, including aluminum.

PTI pressure treated wood products are relatively new to the market place and are not yet widely available in building supply stores. However, there are some suppliers selling PTI products for delivery anywhere in the US on a job lot order basis.

===Sodium silicate===
Sodium silicate is produced by fusing sodium carbonate with sand or heating both ingredients under pressure. It has been in use since the 19th century. It can be a deterrent against insect attack and possesses minor flame-resistant properties; however, it is easily washed out of wood by moisture, forming a flake-like layer on top of the wood.

Timber Treatment Technology, LLC, markets TimberSIL, a sodium silicate wood preservative. The TimberSIL proprietary process surrounds the wood fibers with a protective, non-toxic, amorphous glass matrix. The result is a product the company calls &quot;Glass Wood,&quot; which they claim is Class A fire-retardant, chemically inert, rot and decay resistant, and superior in strength to untreated wood. Timbersil is currently involved in litigation over its claims.

===Potassium silicate===
There are a number of European natural paint fabricants that have developed potassium silicate (potassium waterglass) based preservatives. They frequently include boron compounds, cellulose, lignin and other plant extracts. They are a surface application with a minimal impregnation for internal use.

===Bifenthrin spray===
In Australia, a water-based bifenthrin preservative has been developed to improve the insect resistance of timber. As this preservative is applied by spray, it only penetrates the outer 2 mm of the timber cross-section. Concerns have been raised as to whether this thin-envelope system will provide protection against insects in the longer term, particularly when exposed to sunlight for extended periods.

===Fire retardant treated===
The fireproofing of wood utilizes a fire retardant chemical that remains stable in high temperature environments. The fire retardant is applied under pressure at a wood treating plant like the preservatives described above, or applied as a surface coating.

In both cases, treatment provides a physical barrier to flame spread. The treated wood chars but does not oxidize. Effectively this creates a convective layer that transfers flame heat to the wood in a uniform way which significantly slows the progress of fire to the material. There are several commercially available wood-based construction materials using pressure-treatment (such as those marketed in the United States and elsewhere under the trade names of &#x27;FirePro&#x27;, &#x27;Burnblock&#x27; &#x27;Wood-safe, &#x27;Dricon&#x27;, &#x27;D-Blaze,&#x27; and &#x27;Pyro-Guard&#x27;), as well as factory-applied coatings under the trade names of &#x27;PinkWood&#x27; and &#x27;NexGen&#x27;. Some site-applied coatings as well as brominated fire retardants have lost favor due to safety concerns as well as concerns surrounding the consistency of application. Specialized treatments also exist for wood used in weather-exposed applications.

The only impregnation-applied fire retardant commercially available in Australia is &#x27;NexGen&#x27;. &#x27;Guardian&#x27;, which used calcium formate as a &#x27;powerful wood modifying agent&#x27;, was removed from sale in early 2010 for unspecified reasons.

===Oil-borne===
These include pentachlorophenol (&quot;penta&quot;) and creosote. They emit a strong petrochemical odor and are generally not used in consumer products. Both of these pressure treatments routinely protect wood for 40 years in most applications.

====Coal-tar creosote====

Creosote was the first wood preservative to gain industrial importance more than 150 years ago and it is still widely used today for protection of industrial timber components where long service life is essential.
Creosote is a tar-based preservative that is commonly used for utility poles and railroad ties or sleepers. Creosote is one of the oldest wood preservatives, and was originally derived from a wood distillate, but now, virtually all creosote is manufactured from the distillation of coal tar. Creosote is regulated as a pesticide, and is not usually sold to the general public.

====Linseed oil====
In recent years in Australia and New Zealand, linseed oil has been incorporated in preservative formulations as a solvent and water repellent to &quot;envelope treat&quot; timber. This involves just treating the outer 5 mm of the cross-section of a timber member with preservative (e.g., permethrin 25:75), leaving the core untreated. While not as effective as CCA or LOSP methods, envelope treatments are significantly cheaper, as they use far less preservative. Major preservative manufacturers add a blue (or red) dye to envelope treatments. Blue colored timber is for use south of the Tropic of Capricorn and red for elsewhere. The colored dye also indicates that the timber is treated for resistance to termites/white ants. There is an ongoing promotional campaign in Australia for this type of treatment.

===Other emulsions===
====Light organic solvent preservatives (LOSP)====
This class of timber treatments use white spirit, or light oils such as kerosene, as the solvent carrier to deliver preservative compounds into timber. Synthetic pyrethroids are typically used as an insecticide, such as permethrin, bifenthrin or deltamethrin. In Australia and New Zealand, the most common formulations use permethrin as an insecticide, and propiconazole and tebuconazole as fungicides. While still using a chemical preservative, this formulation contains no heavy-metal compounds.

With the introduction of strict volatile organic compound (VOC) laws in the European Union, LOSPs have disadvantages due to the high cost and long process times associated with vapour-recovery systems. LOSPs have been emulsified into water-based solvents. While this does significantly reduce VOC emissions, the timber swells during treatment, removing many of the advantages of LOSP formulations.

===Epoxy===
Various epoxy resins usually thinned with a solvent like acetone or methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) can be used to both preserve and seal wood. The wood coatings market in general will exceed $12 billion by 2027.

===New technologies===
==== Biological modified timber ====

Biological modified timber is treated with biopolymers from agricultural waste. After drying and curing, the soft timber becomes durable and strong. With this process fast growing pinewood acquires properties similar to tropical hardwood. Production facilities for this process are in The Netherlands and is known under the trade name “NobelWood”.

From agricultural waste, like sugarcane bagasse, furfuryl alcohol is manufactured. Theoretically this alcohol can be from any fermented bio-mass waste and therefore can be called a green chemical. After condensation reactions pre-polymers are formed from furfuryl alcohol. Fast growing softwood is impregnated with the water-soluble bio-polymer. After impregnation the wood is dried and heated which initiates a polymerisation reaction between the bio-polymer and the wood cells. This process results in wood cells which are resistant to microorganisms. At the moment the only timber species which is being used for this process is Pinus radiata. This is the fastest growing tree species on Earth that has a porous structure which is particularly suitable for impregnation processes.

The technique is applied to timber mainly for the building industry as a cladding material. The technique is being further developed in order to reach similar physical and biological properties of other polyfurfuryl impregnated wood species. Besides the impregnation with the biopolymers the timber can also be impregnated with fire retardant resins. This combination creates a timber with durability class I and a fire safety certification of Euro class B.

====Acetylation of wood====

Chemical modification of wood at the molecular level has been used to improve its performance properties. Many chemical reaction systems for the modification of wood, especially those using various types of , have been published; however, the reaction of wood with acetic anhydride has been the most studied. 

The physical properties of any material are determined by its chemical structure. Wood contains an abundance of chemical groups called &quot;free hydroxyls&quot;. Free hydroxyl groups readily absorb and release water according to changes in the climatic conditions to which they are exposed. This is the main reason why wood&#x27;s dimensional stability is impacted by swelling and shrinking. It is also believed that the digestion of wood by enzymes initiates at the free hydroxyl sites, which is one of the principal reasons why wood is prone to decay.

Acetylation effectively changes the compounds with free hydroxyls within wood into acetate esters. This is done by reacting the wood with acetic anhydride, which comes from acetic acid. When free hydroxyl groups are transformed to acetoxy groups, the ability of the wood to absorb water is greatly reduced, rendering the wood more dimensionally stable and, because it is no longer digestible, extremely durable. In general, softwoods naturally have an acetyl content from 0.5 to 1.5% and more durable hardwoods from 2 to 4.5%. Acetylation takes wood well beyond these levels with corresponding benefits. These include an extended coatings life due to acetylated wood acting as a more stable substrate for paints and translucent coatings. acetylated wood is non-toxic and does not have the environmental issues associated with traditional preservation techniques.

The acetylation of wood was first done in Germany in 1928 by Fuchs. In 1946, Tarkow, Stamm and Erickson first described the use of wood acetylation to stabilize wood from swelling in water. Since the 1940s, many laboratories around the world have looked at acetylation of many different types of woods and agricultural resources.

In spite of the vast amount of research on chemical modification of wood, and, more specifically, on the acetylation of wood, commercialization did not come easily. The first patent on the acetylation of wood was filed by Suida in Austria in 1930. Later, in 1947, Stamm and Tarkow filed a patent on the acetylation of wood and boards using pyridine as a catalyst. In 1961, the Koppers Company published a technical bulletin on the acetylation of wood using no catalysis, but with an organic cosolvent In 1977, in Russia, Otlesnov and Nikitina came close to commercialization, but the process was discontinued, presumably because cost-effectiveness could not be achieved. In 2007, Titan Wood, a London-based company, with production facilities in The Netherlands, achieved cost-effective commercialization and began large-scale production of acetylated wood under the trade name &quot;Accoya&quot;.

===Natural===
====Copper plating====
Copper plating or copper sheathing is the practice of covering wood, most commonly wooden hulls of ships, with copper metal. As metallic copper is both repellent and toxic to fungus, insects such as termites, and marine bi-valves this would preserve the wood and also act as an anti-fouling measure to prevent aquatic life from attaching to the ship&#x27;s hull and reducing a ship&#x27;s speed and maneuverability. Modern marine bottom paints often incorporate a significant amount of copper in their formulations for the same reason, although they are not recommended for aluminum hulls because of the possibilities for galvanic corrosion.

====Naturally rot-resistant woods====
These species are resistant to decay in their natural state, due to high levels of organic chemicals called &quot;extractives&quot;, mainly polyphenols, providing them antimicrobial properties. Extractives are chemicals that are deposited in the heartwood of certain tree species as they convert sapwood to heartwood; they are present in both parts though. Huon pine (&quot;Lagarostrobos franklinii&quot;), merbau (&quot;Intsia bijuga&quot;), ironbark (&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; spp.), totara (&quot;Podocarpus totara&quot;), puriri (&quot;Vitex lucens&quot;), kauri (&quot;Agathis australis&quot;), and many cypresses, such as coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) and western red cedar (&quot;Thuja plicata&quot;), fall in this category. However, many of these species tend to be prohibitively expensive for general construction applications.

Huon pine was used for ship hulls in the 19th century, but over-harvesting and Huon pine&#x27;s extremely slow growth rate makes this now a specialty timber. Huon pine is so rot resistant that fallen trees from many years ago are still commercially valuable. Merbau is still a popular decking timber and has a long life in above ground applications, but it is logged in an unsustainable manner and is too hard and brittle for general use. Ironbark is a good choice where available. It is harvested from both old-growth and plantation in Australia and is highly resistant to rot and termites. It is most commonly used for fence posts and house stumps. Eastern red cedar (&quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot;) and black locust (&quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot;) have long been used for rot-resistant fence posts and rails in eastern United States, with the black locust also planted in modern times in Europe. Coast redwood is commonly used for similar applications in the western United States. Totara and puriri were used extensively in New Zealand during the European colonial era when native forests were &quot;mined&quot;, even as fence posts of which many are still operating. Totara was used by the Māori to build large &quot;waka&quot; (canoes). Today, they are specialty timbers as a result of their scarcity, although lower grade stocks are sold for landscaping use. Kauri is a superb timber for building the hulls and decks of boats. It too is now a specialty timber and ancient logs (in excess of 3 000 years) that have been mined from swamps are used by wood turners and furniture makers.

The natural durability or rot and insect resistance of wood species is always based on the heartwood (or &quot;truewood&quot;). The sapwood of all timber species should be considered to be non-durable without preservative treatment.

==== Natural extractives ====
Natural substances, purified from naturally rot-resistant trees and responsible for natural durability, also known as natural &quot;extractives&quot;, are another promising wood preservatives. Several compounds have been described to be responsible for natural durability, including different polyphenols, lignins, lignans (such as gmelinol, plicatic acid), hinokitiol, α-cadinol and other sesquiterpenoids, flavonoids (such as mesquitol), and other substances. These compounds are mostly identified in the heartwood, although they are also present in minimal concentrations in the sapwood. Tannins, which have also shown to act as protectants, are present in the bark of trees. Treatment of timber with natural extractives, such as hinokitiol, tannins, and different tree extracts, has been studied and proposed to be another environmentally-friendly wood preservation method.

====Tung oil====
Tung oil has been used for hundreds of years in China, where it was used as a preservative for wood ships. The oil penetrates the wood, and then hardens to form an impermeable hydrophobic layer up to 5 mm into the wood. As a preservative it is effective for exterior work above and below ground, but the thin layer makes it less useful in practice. It is not available as a pressure treatment.

====Heat treatments====

By going beyond kiln drying wood, heat treatment may make timber more durable. By heating timber to a certain temperature, it may be possible to make the wood fibre less appetizing to insects.

Heat treatment can also improve the properties of the wood with respect to water, with lower equilibrium moisture, less moisture deformation, and weather resistance. It is weather-resistant enough to be used unprotected, in facades or in kitchen tables, where wetting is expected. However, heating can reduce the amount of volatile organic compounds, which generally have antimicrobial properties.

There are four similar heat treatments — Westwood, developed in the United States; Retiwood, developed in France; Thermowood, developed in Finland by VTT; and Platowood, developed in The Netherlands. These processes autoclave the treated wood, subjecting it to pressure and heat, along with nitrogen or water vapour to control drying in a staged treatment process ranging from 24 to 48 hours at temperatures of 180 °C to 230 °C depending on timber species. These processes increase the durability, dimensional stability and hardness of the treated wood by at least one class; however, the treated wood is darkened in colour, and there are changes in certain mechanical characteristics: Specifically, the modulus of elasticity is increased to 10%, and the modulus of rupture is diminished by 5% to 20%. Thus, the treated wood requires drilling for nailing to avoid splitting the wood. Certain of these processes cause less impact than others in their mechanical effects upon the treated wood. Wood treated with this process is often used for cladding or siding, flooring, furniture and windows.

For the control of pests that may be harbored in wood packaging material (i.e. crates and pallets), the ISPM 15 requires heat treatment of wood to 56 °C for 30 minutes to receive the HT stamp. This is typically required to ensure the killing of the pine wilt nematode and other kinds of wood pests that could be transported internationally.

====Mud treatment====
Wood and bamboo can be buried in mud to help protect them from insects and decay. This practice is used widely in Vietnam to build farm houses consisting of a wooden structural frame, a bamboo roof frame and bamboo with mud mixed with rice hay for the walls. While wood in contact with soil will generally decompose more quickly than wood not in contact with it, it is possible that the predominantly clay soils prevalent in Vietnam provide a degree of mechanical protection against insect attack, which compensates for the accelerated rate of decay.

Also, since wood is subject to bacterial decay only under specific temperature and moisture content ranges, submerging it in water-saturated mud can retard decay, by saturating the wood&#x27;s internal cells beyond their moisture decay range.

==Application processes==
===Introduction and history===
Probably the first attempts made to protect wood from decay and insect attack consisted of brushing or rubbing preservatives onto the surfaces of the treated wood. Through trial and error the most effective preservatives and application processes were slowly determined. In the Industrial Revolution, demands for such things as telegraph poles and railroad ties (UK: railway sleepers) helped to fuel an explosion of new techniques that emerged in the early 19th century. The sharpest rise in inventions took place between 1830 and 1840, when Bethell, Boucherie, Burnett and Kyan were making wood-preserving history. Since then, numerous processes have been introduced or existing processes improved. The goal of modern-day wood preservation is to ensure a deep, uniform penetration with reasonable cost, without endangering the environment. The most widespread application processes today are those using artificial pressure through which many woods are being effectively treated, but several species (such as spruce, Douglas-fir, larch, hemlock and fir) are very resistant to impregnation. With the use of incising, the treatment of these woods has been somewhat successful but with a higher cost and not always satisfactory results. One can divide the wood-preserving methods roughly into either non-pressure processes or pressure processes.

===Non-pressure processes===
There are numerous non-pressure processes of treating wood which vary primarily in their procedure. The most common of these treatments involve the application of the preservative by means of brushing or spraying, dipping, soaking, steeping or by means of hot and cold bath. There is also a variety of additional methods involving charring, applying preservatives in bored holes, diffusion processes and sap displacement.

====Brush and spray treatments====
Brushing preservatives is a long-practised method and often used in today&#x27;s carpentry workshops. Technological developments mean it is also possible to spray preservative over the surface of the timber. Some of the liquid is drawn into the wood as the result of capillary action before the spray runs off or evaporates, but unless puddling occurs penetration is limited and may not be suitable for long-term weathering. By using the spray method, coal-tar creosote, oil-borne solutions and water-borne salts (to some extent) can also be applied. A thorough brush or spray treatment with coal-tar creosote can add 1 to 3 years to the lifespan of poles or posts. Two or more coats provide better protection than one, but the successive coats should not be applied until the prior coat has dried or soaked into the wood. The wood should be seasoned before treatment.

====Dipping====
Dipping consists of simply immersing the wood in a bath of creosote or other preservative for a few seconds or minutes. Similar penetrations to that of brushing and spraying processes are achieved. It has the advantage of minimizing hand labor. It requires more equipment and larger quantities of preservative and is not adequate for treating small lots of timber. Usually the dipping process is useful in the treatment of window sashes and doors. Except for copper naphthenate, treatment with copper salt preservative is no longer allowed with this method.

====Steeping====
In this process the wood is submerged in a tank of water-preservative mix, and allowed to soak for a longer period of time (several days to weeks). This process was developed in the 19th century by John Kyan. The depth and retention achieved depends on factors such as species, wood moisture, preservative and soak duration. The majority of the absorption takes place during the first two or three days, but will continue at a slower pace for an indefinite period. As a result, the longer the wood can be left in the solution, the better treatment it will receive. When treating seasoned timber, both the water and the preservative salt soak into the wood, making it necessary to season the wood a second time. Posts and poles can be treated directly on endangered areas, but should be treated at least above the future ground level.

The depth obtained during regular steeping periods varies from up to by sap pine. Due to the low absorption, solution strength should be somewhat stronger than that in pressure processes, around 5% for seasoned timber and 10% for green timber (because the concentration slowly decreases as the chemicals diffuse into the wood). The solution strength should be controlled continually and, if necessary, be corrected with the salt additive. After the timber is removed from the treatment tank, the chemical will continue to spread within the wood if it has sufficient moisture content. The wood should be weighed down and piled so that the solution can reach all surfaces. (Sawed materials stickers should be placed between every board layer.) This process finds minimal use despite its former popularity in continental Europe and Great Britain.

====Kyanizing====
Named after John Howard Kyan, who patented this process in England in 1833, Kyanizing consists of steeping wood in a 0.67% mercuric chloride preservative solution. It is no longer used.

====Gedrian&#x27;s Bath====
Patented by Charles A. Seely, this process achieves treatment by immersing seasoned wood in successive baths of hot and cold preservatives. During the hot baths, the air expands in the timbers. When the timbers are changed to the cold bath (the preservative can also be changed) a partial vacuum is created within the lumen of the cells, causing the preservative to be drawn into the wood. Some penetration occurs during the hot baths, but most of it takes place during the cold baths. This cycle is repeated with a significant time reduction compared to other steeping processes. Each bath may last 4 to 8 hours or in some cases longer. The temperature of the preservative in the hot bath should be between and in the cold bath (depending on preservative and tree species). The average penetration depths achieved with this process ranges from . Both preservative oils and water-soluble salts can be used with this treatment. Due to the longer treatment periods, this method finds little use in the commercial wood preservation industry today.

====Preservative precipitation====
As explained in Uhlig&#x27;s Corrosion Handbook, this process involves two or more chemical baths that undergo a reaction with the cells of the wood, and result in the precipitation of preservative into the wood cells. Two chemicals commonly employed in this process are copper ethanolamine, and sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate, which reacts to precipitate copper dimetyldithiocarbamate. The precipitated preservative is very resistant to leeching. Since its use in the mid-1990s, it has been discontinued in the United States of America, but it never saw commercialization in Canada.

===Pressure processes===
Pressure processes are the most permanent method around today in preserving timber life. Pressure processes are those in which the treatment is carried out in closed cylinders with applied pressure or vacuum. These processes have a number of advantages over the non-pressure methods. In most cases, a deeper and more uniform penetration and a higher absorption of preservative is achieved. Another advantage is that the treating conditions can be controlled so that retention and penetration can be varied. These pressure processes can be adapted to large-scale production. The high initial costs for equipment and the energy costs are the biggest disadvantages. These treatment methods are used to protect ties, poles and structural timbers and find use throughout the world today. The various pressure processes that are used today differ in details, but the general method is in all cases the same. The treatment is carried out in cylinders. The timbers are loaded onto special tram cars, so called &quot;buggies&quot; or &quot;bogies&quot;, and into the cylinder. These cylinders are then set under pressure often with the addition of higher temperature. As final treatment, a vacuum is frequently used to extract excess preservatives. These cycles can be repeated to achieve better penetration.

Light organic solvent preservative (LOSP) treatments often use a vacuum impregnation process. This is possible because of the lower viscosity of the white-spirit carrier used.

====Full-cell process====
In the full-cell process, the intent is to keep as much of the liquid absorbed into the wood during the pressure period as possible, thus leaving the maximum concentration of preservatives in the treated area. Usually, water solutions of preservative salts are employed with this process, but it is also possible to impregnate wood with oil. The desired retention is achieved by changing the strength of the solution. William Burnett patented this development in 1838 of full-cell impregnation with water solutions. The patent covered the use of zinc chloride on water basis, also known as &quot;Burnettizing&quot;. A full-cell process with oil was patented in 1838 by John Bethell. His patent described the injection of tar and oils into wood by applying pressure in closed cylinders. This process is still used today with some improvements.

====Fluctuation pressure process====
Contrary to the static full-cell and empty-cell processes, the fluctuation process is a dynamic process. By this process the pressure inside the impregnation cylinder changes between pressure and vacuum within a few seconds. There have been inconsistent claims that through this process it is possible to reverse the pit closure by spruce. However, the best results that have been achieved with this process by spruce do not exceed a penetration deeper than . Specialized equipment is necessary and therefore higher investment costs are incurred.

====Boucherie process====
Developed by Dr. Boucherie of France in 1838, this approach consisted of attaching a bag or container of preservative solution to a standing or a freshly cut tree with bark, branches, and leaves still attached, thereby injecting the liquid into the sap stream. Through transpiration of moisture from the leaves the preservative is drawn upward through the sapwood of the tree trunk.

The modified Boucherie process consists of placing freshly cut, unpeeled timbers onto declining skids, with the stump slightly elevated, then fastening watertight covering caps or boring a number of holes into the ends, and inserting a solution of copper sulfate or other waterborne preservative into the caps or holes from an elevated container. Preservative oils tend to not penetrate satisfactorily by this method. The hydrostatic pressure of the liquid forces the preservative lengthwise into and through the sapwood, thus pushing the sap out of the other end of the timber. After a few days, the sapwood is completely impregnated; unfortunately little or no penetration takes place in the heartwood. Only green wood can be treated in this manner. This process has found considerable usage to impregnate poles and also larger trees in Europe and North America, and has experienced a revival of usage to impregnate bamboo in countries such as Costa Rica, Bangladesh, India and the state of Hawaii.

====High-pressure sap displacement system====
Developed in the Philippines, this method (abbreviated HPSD) consists of a cylinder pressure cap made from a 3 mm thick mild steel plate secured with 8 sets of bolts, a 2-HP diesel engine, and a pressure regulator with 1.4–14 kg/m2 capacity. The cap is placed over the stump of a pole, tree or bamboo and the preservative is forced into the wood with pressure from the engine.

===Incising===
First tested and patented in 1911 and 1912, this process consists of making shallow, slit-like holes in the surfaces of material to be treated, so that deeper and more uniform penetration of preservative may be obtained. Incisions made in sawed material usually are parallel with the grain of the wood. This process is common in North America (since the 1950s), where Douglas-fir products and pole butts of various species are prepared before treatment. It is most useful for woods that are resistant to side penetration, but allow preservative transport along the grain. In the region in which it is produced, it is common practice to incise all sawed Douglas-fir or more in thickness before treatment.

Unfortunately, the impregnation of spruce, the most important structural timber in large areas in Europe, has shown that unsatisfactory treatment depths have been achieved with impregnation. The maximum penetration of is not sufficient to protect wood in weathered positions. The present-day incising machines consist essentially of four revolving drums fitted with teeth or needles or with lasers that burn the incisions into the wood. Preservatives can be spread along the grain up to in radial and up to in tangential and radial direction.

In North America, where smaller timber dimensions are common, incision depths of have become standard. In Europe, where larger dimensions are widespread, incision depths of are necessary. The incisions are visible and often considered to be wood error. Incisions by laser are significantly smaller than those of spokes or needles. The costs for each process type are approximately for spoke/conventional all-round incising €0.50/m2, by laser incising €3.60/m2 and by needle incision €1.00/m2. (Figures originate from the year 1998 and may vary from present day prices.)

===Microwaving===
An alternative increases the permeability of timber using microwave technology. There is some concern that this method may adversely affect the structural performance of the material. Research in this area has been conducted by the Cooperative Research Centre at the University of Melbourne, Australia.

===Charring===
Charring of timber results in surfaces which are fire-resistant, insect-resistant and proof against weathering. Wood surfaces are ignited using a hand-held burner or moved slowly across a fire. The charred surface is then cleaned using a steel brush to remove loose bits and to expose the grain. Oil or varnish may be applied if required. Charring wood with a red-hot iron is a traditional method in Japan, where it is called or (literally &#x27;fire cypress&#x27;).

<text>McDull () is an anthropomorphic pig cartoon character that was created in Hong Kong by cartoonist Alice Mak and Brian Tse. Although McDull first made his appearance as a supporting character in the &quot;McMug&quot; comics strips, he has since become a central character in his own right. McDull has featured in several comics, TV shows, and films, and has become extremely popular in Hong Kong and East Asia.

==McDull&#x27;s background==
McDull is a male pig who can be distinguished by a birthmark on his right eye. He has a heart of gold, but he isn&#x27;t very smart and is ordinary in every way; nevertheless, he has many dreams. However, every time he tries, he fails; he is disappointed, but tries again, exploring other dreams. In this way, he creates his own colourful world. He lives his life simply and naturally. He is not perfect, but his attitude towards life, namely of never giving up, makes him a popular character. He is very bright and always tries again, and his character is what makes him popular.

The name McDull actually has a story itself. When Mrs. Mak was going to give birth to McDull, she saw a magical plastic basin (兜pronounced roughly as &quot;dull&quot; in Cantonese) flying over her head. Believing it was a sign from the gods, she named her son &quot;Dull&quot;. In &quot;Kung Fu Ding ding dong&quot;, it is explained why McDull is not smart. When McDull was still a baby, Ms. Mak sent him to a test on the Mozart effect. Sadly, he was put in the control group and listened to what was described as &quot;nonsense songs&quot; instead of Mozart.

Here is McDull&#x27;s personal information:

* Date of Birth: June 22, 1995
* Place of birth: Hong Kong Kowloon Kwong Wah Hospital
* Sex: Male
* Kindergarten: Chuntian Huahua Kindergarten
* Dream: To be an Olympic windsurfing champion; to travel to the Maldives
* Personality: Pure, straightforward, open-minded
* Favourite food: Chicken
* Most hated food: Vegetables
* Raised pet: Goldfish named Umbanana
* Mother: Mrs Mak Tam Yuk Lin 麥譚玉蓮 (麥太)
* Father: Mak Bing 麥炳
* Paternal older cousin: McMug 麥嘜

==Family of McDull==

His mother&#x27;s name is &quot;Mrs. Mak Tam Yuk Lin&quot; (麥譚玉蓮) and his father&#x27;s is &quot;Mak Bing&quot; (麥炳). Before the birth of McDull, his father disappeared and therefore Mrs. Mak had to raise McDull as a single mother. Despite their mutual love, mother and son had many conflicts. Mrs. Mak is a typical Hong Kong mother, expecting her son to get good grades, to enter the University of Hong Kong, and to become a respected professional. McDull tries very hard to fulfill his mother&#x27;s wishes, but always fails.

Earlier stories suggested that McMug is a distant (probably paternal) cousin of McDull.

One Christmas day, McDull produced a load of human-shaped dung called Excreman (屎撈人 jyutping: &quot;si2 lou1 jan4&quot;). After giving Excreman a scarf (made out of toilet paper) and a hat (actually a spittoon), he was brought by Excreman to dung-world. There, Excreman shares his wish with him: to become fertilizer for flowers.

When the next morning came, Excreman brought McDull back to his room and went to fulfill his goal. Before leaving, Excreman left a message to McDull: &quot;Remember us whenever you see the humblest, the deserted and the despised&quot;.

This story was very loosely based on the book &quot;The Snowman&quot; by Raymond Briggs. The character Excreman is also similar to &quot;South Park&quot;&#x27;s Mr. Hankey, another cartoon excrement character associated with Christmas.

===Films===
;&quot;My Life as McDull&quot; (2001)
The first McDull movie documented his life and the relationship between him and his mother.

As in the comics, McDull is a who lives with his mother, Mrs. Mak, in Hong Kong. He is a kindergarten student. He has a happy school life with his classmates including geese, tortoises and other pigs. McDull and his mum love each other very much. McDull tries his best to make his mother proud of him and his mother tries hard to give McDull a happy childhood.

McDull wanted to go to the Maldives. His mother could not afford a trip there but she tricks him by taking him to The Peak by tram. The tram has a sign &quot;Go to the Maldives&quot;. It made McDull very happy as he thought that he was really going to the Maldives.

After realizing his dream, McDull set himself another target: to become an Olympic champion just like female windsurfer Lee Lai Shan.

The McMug Story &quot;My Life as McDull&quot; is also being translated into French and shown in France. In this version, Mak Bing is the &quot;father&quot; of McDull, not his father.

;&quot;McDull, Prince de la Bun&quot; (2004)
The sequel, whose Chinese title was:麥兜菠蘿油王子 (lit. &quot;McDull, the prince of the pineapple bun with butter&quot;), was shown in cinemas in Hong Kong. There was again significant word play in this movie, some of it is based on the &quot;pineapple bun&quot;. For example, in slang Cantonese, a 菠蘿蓋 (&quot;bo1lo4 goi3&quot;, &quot;pineapple cap&quot;) is colloquial for kneecap. The movie&#x27;s theme, by the Pancakes, was named Best Original Film Song at the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards.

;&quot;McDull, The Alumni&quot; (2006)
;&quot;McDull, Kung Fu Kindergarten&quot; (2009)
;&quot;McDull, The Pork of Music&quot; (2012)
&quot;McDull, The Pork of Music&quot; (traditional Chinese title: 麥兜噹噹伴我心) was first shown on 10 July 2012 in mainland China, and on 16 Aug 2012 in Hong Kong. Directed by Brian Tse, this movie elaborated on the musical education in McDull&#x27;s Kindergarten.

The principal of the kindergarten contributed all his efforts to teaching music to kids. However, the kindergarten was under continuous financial crisis and was facing the threat to be shut down. Therefore, the principal decided to run a fund-raising dinner and invited the alumni of the kindergarten to donate. The dinner, however, turned out to be a failure because the alumni weren&#x27;t able to donate much money.

Later, the principal found an agent to publicize the choir of the kindergarten and help them earn performing opportunities. After attending several performances, including one in the concert of Andy Lau, the agent took away all the money the choir earned and ran away.

The kindergarten shut down eventually, but the musical education the alumni received had a profound influence on them.

This cartoon was noted by its music, which incorporated classical music and modern elements.

;&quot; 麥兜．飯寶奇兵 (2016)

===Soundtrack===
In 2002, the soundtrack of &quot;My Life as McDull&quot; was released. It was produced by Steve Ho (何崇志), a Hong Kong musician who won Best Original Film Score at the 21st Hong Kong Film Awards. His blend of classical music and &quot;modern&quot; themes in this soundtrack led to a surge of interest in classical music amongst Hong Kong moviegoers.

Notably, McDull&#x27;s theme song is Moments Musicaux No. 3 in F minor by Franz Schubert set with Cantonese lyrics.

The songs in the movie are also available in a karaoke DVD format.

===Television===
;&quot;McDull and Chinese Culture&quot; (2006)

McDull and his fellow nursery pupils featured in five animated RTHK educational episodes running from April 2006 to May 2006. In keeping with the surreal humour of the McDull franchise, the series used humour to make Chinese history and culture accessible. In keeping with RTHK&#x27;s public service broadcasting remit these episodes (as of July 2007) remain partially available to watch from its website.

The episodes follow the same basic format with McDull and friends being lectured by their headmaster about Chinese culture, before being interrupted by one pupil or the other. The narrator would then answer the pupil&#x27;s questions with examples from the life of McDull&#x27;s ancestor Mc Zi (麥子, literally &quot;wheat&quot;, a character sharing the name with 墨子 Mozi, the founder of Mohist order). This is followed by a short history lesson from McDull&#x27;s teacher Miss Chan, often featuring a Chinese festival. The episode than finishes with the evolution of a Chinese character.

====Episodes====
* Episode 1: Hygiene and health. Qingming Festival (a much older McDull is seen at the grave of his mother and grand mother)
* Episode 2: Building and construction. Mid-Autumn Festival (the older McDull is seen thinking of his heimat from what looks like the Brooklyn Bridge)
* Episode 3: Food and Agriculture. Ghost Festival
* Episode 4: Chinese martial arts, medicine, alchemy.
* Episode 5: People and what it is to be a modern Chinese child.

<doc id="481488" wikidata="Q6312473" url="?curid=481488" title="Juneau-Douglas High School">
<text>Juneau-Douglas High School: Yadaa.at Kalé (abbreviated JDHS and named Juneau-Douglas High School through 2019) is one of two high schools in Juneau, Alaska. It is one of two high schools for the Juneau School District, the other being Yaaḵoosgé Daakahídi Alternative High School. As of the 2021–2022 school year, the school&#x27;s principal is Paula Casperson.

In 2019, the phrase &quot;Yadaa.at Kalé&quot; was appended to the school&#x27;s name to honor the original Tlingit heritage of Juneau. The phrase means &quot;beautifully adorned face&quot; in the Tlingit language, and refers to the name of the mountain which faces the school.

== History and symbols ==
The mascot of Juneau-Douglas High School is a fiercely roaring bear; the school&#x27;s teams compete as the Crimson Bears.

JDHS has undergone extensive renovations, most notably to its main hall.

== Athletics ==
The Crimson Bears have seen success and won championships across several sports, including being the state champions in baseball two years in a row in 2002 and 2003, the state champions in boys&#x27; cross-country two years in a row in 2004 and 2005, the state softball champions during the 2004–2005 and 2009–2010 seasons, the 2004–2005 boys&#x27; track and field state champions, the 2004–2005 boys&#x27; swim and diving state champions and the girls&#x27; state champions the following year, and the state football champions in the 2005–2006 and 2007–2008 seasons. The Crimson Bears finished second overall in the high school state soccer championship in the 2005–2006 season. In 2008, the Crimson Bears won state titles in baseball, softball, and boys&#x27; soccer.

In the &#x27;06 summer season, the tennis team enjoyed victory in Fairbanks in an Alaska-wide tournament. In 2008 the Bears baseball, softball, and boys&#x27; soccer programs all won state titles. In 2010 both baseball and boys&#x27; soccer won state championships, and the boys&#x27; soccer team repeated in 2011 for a second straight state championship. The women&#x27;s basketball team beat Wasilla to become the state champions in 2010. JDHS women&#x27;s basketball lost to Wasilla the next year, in 2011, in the state championship game. In 2016, the JDHS boys varsity beat Dimond High School for the state title. JDHS Girls Varsity Soccer won the state title for the 2017–2018 school year, and the JDHS Cross Country team won the state championship for the 2018–2019 season.

In November 2017, the Juneau School District voted to merge JDHS&#x27;s football team with Thunder Mountain High School&#x27;s, citing travel costs and declining roster numbers. In February 2018, students from both schools voted on a nickname for the newly merged team, with &quot;Thunder Bears&quot; winning. In March, the nickname caused controversy when an alternate definition of the term was discovered to be a slur for someone &quot;usually of Native American descent&quot; who drank too much alcohol. On March 10, the school board voted 5–4 to reject the nickname, ordering the committee to pick a new one. The merged football team ultimately entered the 2018-2019 season without a mascot. In January 2019, the students choose the &quot;Juneau Huskies&quot; as the new mascot for the merged team.

JDHS&#x27;s girls&#x27; soccer team won three consecutive state championships, in 2018, 2019, and 2021, where the 2020 season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Notable alumni==
* Chad Bentz, Major League Baseball pitcher.
* Carlos Boozer, professional basketball player and Olympic gold medalist.
* Douglas J. Eboch, screenwriter who wrote the story for &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (2002).
* Hilary Lindh, downhill skier for the United States Ski Team and Olympic silver medalist.
*Joseph Fredrick, plaintiff in the Supreme Court decision &quot;Morse v. Frederick&quot; (2007).

<text>RAF Transport Command was a Royal Air Force command that controlled all transport aircraft of the RAF. It was established on 25 March 1943 by the renaming of the RAF Ferry Command, and was subsequently renamed RAF Air Support Command in 1967.

==History==
===Second World War===
During the Second World War, it at first ferried aircraft from factories to operational units and performed air transport. Later it took over the job of dropping paratroops from Army Cooperation Command as well. Transport Command was the only RAF command in to which aircrew originating in the Caribbean were not posted due to the fact that they might be required to fly to the United States where racial discrimination was legally entrenched at the time.

In June 1944 the Command was made up of No. 38 Group RAF; No. 44 Group RAF; No. 45 Group RAF; No. 46 Group RAF; No. 216 Group RAF; No. 229 Group RAF; No. 114 Wing RAF, and No. 116 Wing RAF at RAF Hendon.

No. 44 Group RAF - HQ at Gloucester
* &quot;In the early days of the North Atlantic route, there was ..at the eastern end ..the Overseas Air Movements Control Unit (OAMCU) which in August 1941 was up-rated to become No 44 Group, thus becoming the second piece of the Transport Command jigsaw. With its Headquarters at Barnwood (near RAF Innsworth) in Gloucester, [the group] organised the receipt of all aircraft arriving from across the Atlantic, as well as the despatch of those going out to the Mediterranean and the Far East; it also co-ordinated the massive influx of USAAF aircraft and crews under Operation Bolero.&quot; 
* Controlled airfields such as Bramcote (where 105 Operational Training Unit was located), Filton, Hendon, Hurn, Kemble, Llandow, Lyneham, Melton Mowbray, Pershore, Portreath, Prestwick, St Mawgan and Talbenny

No. 45 Group RAF - HQ at Dorval in Canada, (the former Atlantic Ferry Organization)
* No. 112 Wing at Dorval
* No. 113 Wing at Nassau
* became No. 45 Wing for a short time before disbanding

No. 46 Group RAF - HQ at Harrow Weald
* Controlled airfields such as Blakehill Farm
* Units included Nos 233, 512 575 Squadrons

No. 216 Group RAF HQ in Egypt

No. 229 Group RAF HQ at Delhi, India (formed 1943–44); controlled No. 177 Wing

No. 114 Wing RAF - HQ at Accra in the Gold Coast,
* Controlled airfields such as Heliopolis
* Units included No. 284 Wing

No. 116 Wing RAF at RAF Hendon, which supervised scheduled services to India.

On 17 February 1945 No. 87 Group RAF was formed in Paris to control units in Paris and southern France. It was disbanded by being reduced to No. 87 Wing RAF on 15 July 1946.

====Accidents====

Operating as it did under wartime conditions, Transport Command had a relatively high accident rate. Prominent accidents included a July 1943 crash at Gibraltar, killing the Polish leader General Sikorski and several other senior figures in the exile government; a February 1945 crash in the Mediterranean, killing eleven members of the British delegation to the Yalta Conference; and a March 1945 disappearance over the North Atlantic involving the aircraft formerly used as a private transport by Winston Churchill. 

Following these and other losses, in April 1945, concerns were raised in Parliament about the experience of crews and the maintenance of aircraft within Transport Command. One frequent issue reported was that VIP passengers were said to put pressure on crews to fly in difficult conditions; the Air Ministry reported that it had tried to put in place orders to prevent this.

===Post war===

As the Second World War ended, on 7 May 1945, No. 4 Group RAF was transferred into the command, from Bomber Command, but disbanded in early 1948; No. 44 Group disbanded by being amalgamated into No 46 Group on 14 August 1946; No. 48 Group RAF was established, but then disbanded on 15 May 1946; and No. 216 Group was transferred to RAF Mediterranean and Middle East. On 1 November 1949, No. 47 Group RAF disbanded by being renumbered 46 Group.

Overseas, two groups had been formed in India and Australia towards the end of the war. No. 232 Group RAF disbanded, now in Singapore on 15 August 1946, and 300 Group (24 April 1946 – 7 November 1946) in Sydney.

The Command took part in several big operations, including the Berlin Airlift in 1948, which reinforced the need for a large RAF transport fleet. The Handley Page Hastings, a four-engined transport, was introduced during the Berlin Airlift and continued as a mainstay transport aircraft of the RAF for the next 15 years. In 1956, new aircraft designs became available, including the de Havilland Comet (the first operational jet transport), and the Blackburn Beverley. In 1959, the Bristol Britannia was introduced, with No. 99 Squadron RAF. No. 511 Squadron RAF was re-formed again at RAF Lyneham on 15 December 1959, as the second squadron to operate the Britannia on long-range trooping flights. 

During the 1960s the command was divided into three different forces:
* Strategic Force which operated the Comets, Britannias, VC-10s and Belfasts. Deliveries of the Vickers VC10 to No. 10 Squadron RAF began in December 1966 and ended in August 1968.
* Medium Range Force which operated Beverleys, Hastings and Argosys
* Short Range Force which operated helicopters such as the Bristol Belvedere, Westland Whirlwind and Westland Wessex and fixed wing aircraft such as Scottish Aviation Pioneers, Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneers and Hawker Siddeley Andovers.

During the 1950s and 1960s Transport Command evacuated military personnel from the Suez Canal Zone prior and after the Suez Crisis of October–November 1956; evacuated casualties from South Korea during the Korean War and from the Malaya during the Malayan Emergency; moved essential supplies to Woomera, South Australia, and ferried personnel and supplies out to Christmas Island for the UK&#x27;s atomic bomb tests. In addition, Transport Command ran scheduled routes to military staging posts and bases in the Indian Ocean region, Southeast Asia and the Far East, to maintain contact between the UK and military bases of strategic importance. It also carried out special flights worldwide covering all the continents bar Antarctica. Many varied tasks were undertaken during the 1950s.

The 1960s saw a reduction of the RAF and a loss of independence of the former functional commands. Transport Command was renamed Air Support Command in 1967.

=== Other tasks in the 1950s ===
Operation Becher&#x27;s Brook was a major operation of Transport Command – the ferrying of 400 Canadair Sabre fighters from North America to the UK, circa 1952. This required pilots and ground crew to be transported to Canada. The Sabres were flown via Keflavik (Iceland) on to Shetland and from there to mainland Scotland.

Transport Command also supported the British North Greenland expedition a research expedition from 1952–54 on the Greenland ice.

== Structure ==

=== Groups ===
No. 44 (Ferry) Group RAF was formed on 15 August 1941 at Eastern Avenue, Barnwood, Gloucester within RAF Ferry Command. It moved to Transport Command on 25 March 1943 and controlled non-operational aircraft moving to and from the UK to the south or west. It was disbanded on 14 August 1946 and absorbed into No. 46 Group.
* April 1942 - HQ at Gloucester
** RAF Prestwick = No. 1527 (Beam Approach Training) Flight RAF
** RAF Kemble = No. 1 Overseas Aircraft Preparation Unit RAF &amp; No. 2 Overseas Aircraft Preparation Unit RAF

** RAF Honeybourne = Ferry Training Unit RAF
** RAF Hurn = No. 1425 (Communication) Flight RAF
** RAF Lyneham = No. 1445 Flight RAF
No. 47 (Transport) Group RAF was formed on 1 January 1945 at The Hall, Milton Ernest, Bedfordshire within Transport Command. It reabsorbed No. 48 (Transport) Group on 1 April 1946, No. 47 moved to RAF Abingdon on 15 April 1948 and was redesignated No. 46 Group on 1 November 1949.
No. 48 (Transport) Group was formed on 29 October 1945 out of No. 47 Group at The Hall, Milton Ernest, Bedfordshire within Transport Command. It was disbanded into No. 47 Group on 15 May 1946.

===Wings===
During its existence the command supervised a number of wings:
=== Units ===
Units included:
* The Airborne Forces Tactical Development Unit was formed at RAF Tarrant Rushton on 1 December 1943 and was disbanded on 14 January 1944 to become the Air Transport Tactical Development Unit. This new unit was then disbanded on 31 August 1945 at RAF Netheravon to become the Transport Command Development Unit. This unit was disbanded at RAF Abingdon on 28 February 1950 to become the Air Transport Development Flight, this new unit was disbanded on 14 October 1951 still at Abingdon to become the Transport Command Development Flight. This unit was disbanded on 8 February 1957 at RAF Benson.
* The Transport Command Aircrew Examining Unit was previously the Aircrew Testing and Grading Unit and was formed on 1 November 1945 at RAF Melbourne. It used a variety of transport aircraft until it was disbanded on 7 August 1946 at RAF Bramcote to become the Transport Command Examining Unit. This unit continued the work of the previous unit until it was disbanded on 23 June 1964 at RAF Benson, the unit then became the Transport Command Examining Staff until 1 August 1967 while still at RAF Benson became the Air Support Examining Unit
* Transport Command Air Support Flight was formed on 1 February 1953 at RAF Abingdon but was shortly disbanded on 14 September 1954 to become No. 1312 (Transport Support) Flight
* Transport Command Communication Flight was initially &#x27;C&#x27; Flight of the Metropolitan Communication Squadron RAF and was separated doing May 1946 when it moved to RAF Upavon.

<doc id="481501" wikidata="Q1101628" url="?curid=481501" title="Clinton–Kalamazoo Canal">
<text>The Clinton–Kalamazoo Canal is a canal in Michigan that was abandoned after being only partially completed. The canal was to connect Lake St. Clair with Lake Michigan. Project backers were inspired by the success of the Erie Canal in New York, which was completed in 1825. After gaining statehood in 1837, Michigan elected its first governor, Stevens Thomson Mason, who initiated an ambitious program of internal improvements, including three railroads and two canals. On March 21, 1837, the Legislature authorized Governor Mason to contract a loan for the construction of the canal from Mt. Clemens to Rochester, a railroad from Shelby to Detroit, a railroad from Detroit across the State (the Michigan Central) and a railroad from Port Huron into the interior, to be known as the Port Huron &amp; Grand River road. In the spring of 1838, a Board of Commissioners composed of seven men, was appointed to take charge of the canal work.

==History==
As the primary inland waterway into Macomb County, the Clinton River served an essential role in the early days of the Michigan Territory. Both the cities of Mt Clemens and Utica were founded (in part) based on their proximity to the Clinton River and farmer-settlers flocking to the territory bought up land first along its shores.

Because rivers, at the time, were the only practical means of transporting goods, both Utica and Mt Clemens became important early towns. Utica, with its milling operations and neighboring farms, became an important dropping-off point for farmers looking to sell their crops. The cargo, loaded in Utica, was sent to Mt Clemens, which was already building itself as a primary supplier to the growing City of Detroit.

=== First Attempt at Regulating River Traffic: The Clinton River Navigation Company ===

The first attempt to regulate the flow of cargo and passengers along the Clinton River came in the form of the Clinton River Navigation Company; incorporated by the Territorial Government on April 12, 1827; authorized for the purpose of removing obstructions from the Clinton river, and making such river navigable for boats from the village of Mount Clemens to Mack&#x27;s lower mills (so called), in the county of Oakland.&quot;

The length of this proposed private enterprise was about thirty miles, and it was calculated that it would afford invaluable shipping facilities to a large extent of rich agricultural country.

The incorporators of this company were Nathaniel Millard, Jonathan Kearsley, Levi Cook, Charles Larned, Ellis Doty, John R. Sheldon, Christian Clemens, Alfred Ashley, Jacob Tucker, Ignace Morass, and Joseph Hayes. The company were required, under the act of incorporation, to clear out the river to the east line of Oakland County, commencing on or before the first day of July, 1827, and when they had made it navigable for flat-bottomed boats or bateaux to the line of the county, they were to be entitled to collect toll, not exceeding fifty cents per ton for the whole distance and proportionally for less distances. When the river was made navigable as far as Mack&#x27;s mill, and a good towpath constructed on one bank, the company were entitled to demand toll not exceeding seventy-five cents per ton for the whole distance and in proportion for a less distance.

Parties owning water power on the river below the east line of Oakland County were required to construct locks at every dam sufficient for the passage of the company&#x27;s boats. The river above the said line was declared by the act of incorporation a public highway, but persons owning land extending across the river had the right to construct dams for water-power purposes by putting in the necessary locks, or the company could construct them at the expense of the parties owning the lands. The improvements were finally completed as far as Rochester, a portion of the State loan of five millions being appropriated to the work. Business was carried on to a small extent for a number of years, but the enterprise was never a prosperous one.

It is unknown whether this company met the requirements of its incorporation; or how long they were in operation if they succeeded.

=== The Clinton-Kalamazoo Canal ===
Following the success of the Erie Canal, and Michigan becoming a state in January 1837; several acts were passed providing for building of three railroads, and the Clinton–Kalamazoo Canal. These projects were to be financed through a $5 million loan; and payment for the loan would be funded through the states portion on future sale of public lands.
The Clinton–Kalamazoo Canal was to begin in Mount Clemens on the banks of the Clinton River and continue through Utica, Rochester, Pontiac, Howell, Hastings, and finally to the mouth of the Kalamazoo River. In all, the canal was to span 216 miles. From Pontiac westward, the canal would carry new settlers and supplies to the interior of the state and eventually connect with the &quot;thriving&quot; Lake Michigan port of Singapore (now a ghost town). Singapore was to ship passengers and freight to Chicago across Lake Michigan.

Construction began in 1838 with much fanfare. The groundbreaking ceremony, held on August 8, 1838 was attended by many notable residents and involved parties; with Governor Mason attending, and taking the ceremonial first shovel.

Financial troubles related to the Panic of 1837 caused funding for the canal to disappear. All construction stopped in 1843 after only 13 miles had been completed. Many workers who were unpaid destroyed parts of the canal and stole supplies. Engineering miscalculations also contributed to the canal&#x27;s failure, as the canal was dug too shallow and too narrow for heavy freight barges.

About 1844, Amos Brown, of Rochester, constructed and launched a log flatboat, and collecting a party of his friends, they proceeded to celebrate the occasion by a grand ride on the canal, but when they came to the first lock, they found their craft too wide to admit of a passage. The locks were constructed of logs, and the pressure of the super-incumbent earth against their sides had sprung them in, narrowing the space considerably. A fellow who had served a term in the State prison made quite a speculation by burning some of the locks and selling the old iron.

A dam was built at Frederick across the Clinton to supply the locks, and in 1845, boats were running from Utica to Frederick. That year, the revenue to the State from canal tolls was $46.90; the next year, it was $43.44; in 1847, the income was even less, and, in 1848, the canal was in disuse. After construction ended, the canal quickly fell into disrepair. Portions were used as a millrace to power watermills that operated until the 1940s. The canal was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The route of the canal has been marked by signs and historic markers.

==Today==

Remnants of the canal are still visible in Rochester Hills in Oakland County and in Shelby Township, Utica and Clinton Township in Macomb County. Much of the canal is clearly visible in parks and along Canal Road in Clinton Township. In River Bends Park multiple mountain biking and hiking trails run along the edge of the canal. The remains of the aqueduct built over the Clinton River can be seen in Yates Park, and two wood dams can be seen in the river in Canal Park and Bloomer Park. No locks are visible along the canal but the locations of a few are known.

<doc id="481509" wikidata="Q323409" url="?curid=481509" title="Mul of Kent">
<text>Mul (, literally &quot;mule&quot;) (died 687) was an Anglo-Saxon ruler of the Kingdom of Kent in England.

==Biography==

The name Mul is very unusual and it has been postulated that it derives from the Latin &quot;mulus&quot; meaning mule, a word which is known to have entered the Old English vocabulary; presumably it was a nickname which became habitual. Mul&#x27;s father was Coenberht, making him a member of the House of Wessex (a descendant of Cynric) and his brother was Caedwalla of Wessex. Mul is described as briefly ruling as King of the Kingdom of Kent following its conquest by Caedwalla in 686. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; relates that in 686, &quot;Caedwalla and Mul, his brother, ravaged Kent and Wight.&quot; Mul&#x27;s reign is also mentioned in a charter of the later king Swæfheard.

===Death===
Mul seems to have only ruled a year before the local population rose up in revolt against him in 687, chasing him and his followers into a building near the local church and setting it on fire, burning them to death. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that &quot;Mul was burned in Kent, and 12 other men with him; and that year Caedwalla again ravaged Kent.&quot; The same &quot;Chronicle&quot; notes that in 694 the people of Kent came to terms with Ine of Wessex, Caedwalla&#x27;s successor, and granted him a sum &quot;because they had burned Mul earlier&quot;.

<doc id="481514" wikidata="Q2279955" url="?curid=481514" title="Nokia 6620">
<text>The 6620 is a mobile phone created by Nokia, announced in 2005, running on Series 60 2nd Edition and the Symbian operating system. It was the first EDGE-capable phone for the Americas&#x27; market.

It is a version of Nokia&#x27;s 6600 smartphone for the North American market, with all the features of the 6600 such as the VGA camera, MultiMediaCard slot, Bluetooth and color screen, but with a change to the North American GSM frequencies, newer version of Nokia Series 60 v2 with Feature Pack 1 (the original 6600 had common Series 60 v2 without Feature Packs), the doubling of internal RAM, the addition of Nokia&#x27;s new Pop-Port connector, the inclusion of stereo sound, and a new EDGE capability, effectively giving it double the download speeds of contemporary General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)-equipped phones. Although not officially designed as a successor, it replaced the Nokia 3620 in the Cingular Wireless (now AT&amp;T Mobility) lineup shortly after their acquisition of AT&amp;T Wireless Services.

This phone usually came packaged with a charger, battery, 32-megabyte MMC card and USB cable.

==Features==
* 65,000 color screen
* VGA camera for pictures and video
* GSM voice communication (850 MHz, 1800 MHz and 1900 MHz)
* GPRS and EDGE data communication
* Bluetooth, infrared and USB connectivity
* Support for SMS, MMS and email messages
* Multiple mailboxes for remote email downloads
* Web browsing for WAP and HTTP websites
* 12 megabytes internal memory
* MMC expansion slot supporting up to 2 gigabytes
* Hands-free speakerphone
* Multiple ringtones included with space for more
* Usual software including calendar, calculator, wallet, messaging, voice recorder, phone book, gallery, notes
* Symbian and Java support for applications and games
* Instant Messaging (IM) support
* RealPlayer included for audio and video playback
* Full MP3 support, including saved playlists
* Stereo audio playback using Nokia stereo headphones or Nokia AD-15 3.5mm stereo headphone adapter (the 6600 is mono-only)

==Digital downloads==
The EDGE capability allows the 6620 to play streaming video, so that users may view video clips that are not stored on the phone itself. The phone also supports downloading smart messages from the network, if supported by the network operator, to update settings.

==Technical specifications==
The main CPU in this phone is an ARM925t-compatible chip running at 150 MHz while the 6600 only runs at 104 MHz. The camera supports resolutions up to 640x480 and has a 2x digital zoom. It can record video for up to 10 minutes. The RealPlayer software can play back video and audio, and also files in MP3 and AVI format. The talk time is listed at 4 hours, with 200 hours of standby.

====The Mobira/Nokia series (1982–1990)====
The earliest phones produced by Nokia. These all use 1G networks.

====Original series (1992–1999)====
The last 1G phones by Nokia.

====4-digit series (1992–2010, 2017–2024)====

=====Nokia 1xxx – Ultrabasic series (1992–2010)=====
The Nokia 1000 series include Nokia&#x27;s most affordable phones with 2G network. They are mostly targeted towards developing countries and users who do not require advanced features beyond making calls and SMS text messages, alarm clock, calendar, and reminders. Several later models of the 1000 series features an FM radio and a built-in LED flashlight.

The 1000 series traditionally lacks cameras, with the exception of Nokia 1680 classic being the only one in the lineup to feature a camera.

=====Nokia 2xxx – Basic series (1994–2010, 2019–2022)=====
Like the 1000 series, the 2000 series are entry-level phones. However, the 2000 series generally contain more advanced features than the 1000 series, with many featuring color screens. Several newer models included camera, Bluetooth, microSD card slot, and even GPS, such as in the case of the Nokia 2710.

=====Nokia 3xxx – Expression series (1997–2009, 2017–2024)=====
The Nokia 3000 series are mostly mid-range phones targeted towards the youth market. Many of these models included visually attractive designs to appeal to the younger demographic, unlike the 6000-series which were more conservatively styled to appeal to business users, and the 7000-series which targeted the fashion-conscious.

Nokia 4xxx

The Nokia 4000 series was officially skipped as a sign of deference from Nokia towards East Asian customers.

=====Nokia 5xxx – Active series (1998–2010, 2020–2024)=====

The Nokia 5000 series is similar in features to the 3000 series, but often contains more features geared toward active individuals. Many of the 5000 series phones feature a rugged construction or contain extra features for music playback. The Nokia XpressMusic lineup forms a majority of the 5000 series from 2006 to 2010, before being superseded by the Nokia Xseries.

=====Nokia 6xxx – Classic Business series (1995–2010, 2020–2024)=====

The Nokia 6000 series is Nokia&#x27;s largest family of phones. It consists mostly of mid-range to high-end phones (many of which are Symbian smartphones) containing a wider number of features. The 6000 series is notable for their conservative, unisex designs, which makes them popular among business users.

Nokia 6136 UMA is the first mobile phone to include Unlicensed Mobile Access. Nokia 6131 NFC is the first mobile phone to include Near Field Communication.

=====Nokia 7xxx – Fashion and Experimental series (1999–2010)=====
The Nokia 7000 series is a family of Nokia phones with two uses. Most phones in the 7000 series are targeted towards fashion-conscious users, often with feminine styling to appeal to women. Some phones in this family also test features. The 7000 series are considered to be a more consumer-oriented family of phones when contrasted to the business-oriented 6000 series. The family is also distinguished from the 3000-series phones as being more mature and female-oriented, while the 3000-series was largely targeted towards the youth market.
The 7110 was the first Nokia phone with a WAP browser. WAP was significantly hyped up during the 1998–2000 Internet boom. However WAP did not meet these expectations and uptake was limited. Another industry first was the flap, which slid from beneath the phone with a push from the release button. Unfortunately the cover was not too durable. The 7110 was also the only phone to feature a navi-roller key.

The 7250i was a slightly improved version of the Nokia 7250. It includes XHTML and OMA Forward lock digital rights management. The phone has exactly the same design as the 7250. This phone is far more popular than the 7250 and has been made available on pre-paid packages and therefore it is very popular amongst youths in the UK and other European countries.

The 7510 Supernova was a phone exclusive to T-Mobile USA. Only some units of this model have Wi-Fi chips with UMA. The Wi-Fi adapter on this phone supports up to WPA2 encryption if present. This phone uses Xpress-On Covers.

The 7650 was the first Series 60 smartphone of Nokia. It was quite basic compared to smartphones, it didn&#x27;t have MMC slot, but it had a camera.

The 7610 was Nokia&#x27;s first smartphone featuring a megapixel camera (1,152x864 pixels), and is targeted towards the fashion conscious individual. End-users can also use the 7610 with Nokia Lifeblog. Other pre-installed applications include the Opera and Kodak Photo Sharing. It is notable for its looks, having opposite corners rounded off. It comes with a 64 MB Reduced Size MMC. The main CPU is an ARM compatible chip (ARM4T architecture) running at 123 MHz.

The 7710&#x27;s 640x320 screen was a touch screen phone.

=====Nokia 8xxx – Premium series (1996–2007, 2018–2022)=====
This series is characterized by ergonomics and attractiveness. The internals of the phone are similar to those in different series and so on that level offer nothing particularly different, however the physical handset itself offers a level of functionality which appeals to users who focus on ergonomics. The front slide keypad covers offered a pseudo-flip that at the time Nokia were unwilling to make. Materials used increased the cost and hence exclusivity of these handsets.

The only exception to the rule (there are many in different series) is the 82xx and 83xx which were very small and light handsets.

=====Nokia 9xxx – Communicator series (1996–2007)=====
The Nokia 9000 series was reserved for the Communicator series, but the last Communicator, the E90 Communicator, was an Eseries phone.

====Lettered series: C/E/N/X (2005–2011)====

=====Cseries (2010–2011)=====
The Nokia Cseries is an affordable series optimized for social networking and sharing. The range includes a mix of feature phones running Series 40 and some smartphones running Symbian.

C1-00 and C2-00 are dual SIM phones, but with Nokia C1-00 both SIM cards cannot be utilized at the same time.

=====Eseries (2006–2011)=====
The Nokia Eseries is an enterprise-class series with business-optimized products. They are all smartphones and run Symbian.

=====Nseries (2005–2011)=====

The Nseries are highly advanced smartphones, with strong multimedia and connectivity features and build as many other features as possible into one device.

Note:
* Although part of the Nseries, the Nokia N800 and N810 Internet Tablets did not include phone functionality. See the Internet Tablets section.
* The Nokia N950 was meant to be the Nokia N9 with the old Nokia N9 &#x27;Lankku&#x27; being N9-01, however the N9-00 model number was used for the all touch &#x27;Lankku&#x27; with the original design being the MeeGo developer-only N950.

=====Xseries (2009–2011)=====

The Nokia Xseries targets a young audience with a focus on music and entertainment. Like the Cseries, it is a mix of both Series 30/40/ feature phones and Series 60/Symbian smartphones.

====3-digit series Symbian phones (2011–2012)====
Since the Nokia 500, Nokia has changed the naming rule for Symbian^3 phones.

====Worded series: Asha/Lumia/X (2011–2014)====

=====Asha (2011–2014)=====
The Nokia Asha series is an affordable series optimized for social networking and sharing, meant for first time users. All phones run Series 40 except Asha 230 and 50x phones, which run on the Nokia Asha platform.

=====Lumia (2011–2014)=====

Lumia is a series of smartphones running Windows Phone. It also includes the Nokia Lumia 2520, a Windows RT-powered tablet computer. The series was sold to Microsoft in 2014 who branded these products under the name Microsoft.

Devices with Microsoft branding are not listed here.

=====X Family (2014)=====
The Nokia X family is a range of Android smartphones from Nokia. These were the first ever Nokia phones to run Google&#x27;s Android OS.

====3-digit series feature phones (2011–present)====
These phones are entry-level, classic mobile phones (with relatively long lasting battery life). The series was sold in 2014 to Microsoft which continued branding these products under Nokia. Microsoft sold this series to HMD Global in 2016 which also continues branding these products under Nokia.

====Other phones====

=====N-Gage – Mobile gaming devices (2003–2004)=====

These included the Mikko series of minicomputers intended for use in the finance and banking industry, and the MPS-10 minicomputer (with an OS programmed in the Ada programming language) which was widely used in major Finnish banks in the late 1980s.

====Personal computers====
In the 1980s, Nokia&#x27;s personal computer division Nokia Data manufactured a series of personal computers by the name of MikroMikko. The MikroMikko series included the following products and product series.

Nokia&#x27;s PC division was sold to the British computer company ICL in 1991. In 1990, Fujitsu had acquired 80% of ICL plc, which throughout the decade became wholly part of Fujitsu. Personal computers and servers were marketed under the ICL brand; the Nokia MikroMikko line of compact desktop computers continued to be produced at the Kilo factories in Espoo, Finland. Components, including motherboards and Ethernet network adapters were manufactured locally, until production was moved to Taiwan. Internationally the MikroMikko line was marketed by Fujitsu as the ErgoPro.

In 1999, Fujitsu Siemens Computers was formed as a joint venture between Fujitsu Computers Europe and Siemens Computer Systems, wherein all of ICL&#x27;s hardware business (except VME mainframes) was absorbed into the joint venture. On 1 April 2009, Fujitsu bought out Siemens&#x27; share of the joint venture, and Fujitsu Siemens Computers became Fujitsu Technology Solutions. Fujitsu continues to manufacture computers in Europe, including PC mainboards developed and manufactured in-house.

<doc id="481521" wikidata="Q1247186" url="?curid=481521" title="Kung Fu (1972 TV series)">
<text>Kung Fu is an American action-adventure martial arts Western drama television series starring David Carradine. The series follows the adventures of Kwai Chang Caine, a Shaolin monk who travels through the American Old West, armed only with his spiritual training and his skill in martial arts, as he seeks Danny Caine, his half-brother.

Many of the aphorisms used in the series are adapted from or derived directly from the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, a book of ancient Taoist philosophy attributed to the sage Lao-tzu.

==Plot==


Kwai Chang Caine (David Carradine) is the orphaned son of an American man, Thomas Henry Caine (Bill Fletcher), and a Chinese woman, Kwai Lin, born in mid-19th-century China. After his maternal grandfather&#x27;s death he is accepted for training at a Shaolin Monastery, where he grows up to become a Shaolin priest and martial arts expert.

In the pilot episode, Caine&#x27;s beloved mentor and elder, Master Po, is murdered by the Emperor&#x27;s nephew with a firearm; outraged, Caine retaliates by killing the nephew, with everyone unaware that the man was reloading his weapon to attack again. With a price on his head, Caine flees China to the western United States, where he seeks to find his family roots, and ultimately, his half-brother, Danny Caine. A recent tombstone dated 1874 in a season 3 episode places the stories approximately between 1871 and 1875. In the pilot episode, we see a telegram dated 21 November 1873, indicating that most of the show&#x27;s American story begins in November 1873.

Although it is his intention to avoid notice, Caine&#x27;s training and sense of social responsibility repeatedly force him out into the open, to fight for justice or protect the underdog. After each such encounter he must move on, both to avoid capture and prevent harm from coming to those he has helped. Searching for his family, he meets his grandfather (played by Dean Jagger).

Flashbacks are often used to recall specific lessons from Caine&#x27;s childhood training in the monastery from his teachers, the blind Master Po (Keye Luke) and Master Chen Ming Kan (Philip Ahn). In those flashbacks, Master Po advises his young student &quot;patience, Grasshopper&quot;, a nickname given from a playful lesson he taught to Caine as a child about being aware of the world around him, including the grasshopper that happened to be at his feet at that moment.

During four episodes of the third and final season (&quot;Barbary House&quot;, &quot;Flight to Orion&quot;, &quot;The Brothers Caine&quot;, and &quot;Full Circle&quot;), Caine finds his brother Danny (Tim McIntire) and his nephew Zeke (John Blyth Barrymore).

==Cast==

===Regular cast===
* David Carradine as Kwai Chang Caine (63 episodes)
* Radames Pera as Young Caine (48 episodes)
* Keye Luke as Master Po (48 episodes)
* Philip Ahn as Master Kan (40 episodes)

===Guest cast===
This list comprises a selection of actors billed in the opening credits, and some actors whose characters were decisive in the episode plot&#x27;s development or who later became widely recognized for other productions. Among them there are nominees and winners of Academy Awards, Emmy, Golden Globe, Tony, and other film and theater awards. At the minute 6:39 of the &quot;Kung Fu&quot; DVD documentary &quot;The Tao of Caine: Production and Beyond&quot;, Herbie J. Pilato says: &quot;One of the great things about &quot;Kung Fu&quot; is that it had this incredible A-list of guest stars. You know, there were stars then, and they became stars later (...) So, it was a breeding ground for A-1 talent and it was also just surrounded by A-1 talent, I mean, in front of and behind the scenes. They didn&#x27;t settle for less.&quot; Jerry Thorpe added: &quot;People wanted to do the show because it was unique, it&#x27;s as simple as that. Yes, it was fairly easy to cast people that normally wouldn&#x27;t do a series television.&quot;

This list does not reflect the full extent of Asian American actors&#x27; participation, since most of them were billed in the series&#x27; closing credits. It can be noticed that a group of Asian actors appeared repeatedly in the series. According to John Furia Jr. in a May 1973 interview, this happened because &quot;one of the problems we&#x27;re faced with is that Oriental actors did not have much opportunity to act in TV or movies before, and so there is no great pool to draw from. So far, availability of martial artists for the training and fighting scenes has been good.&quot; Asian actors who returned often to the series were mostly members of the East West Players, brought to the series by Guy Lee, who would take charge of Bessie Loo&#x27;s Talent Agency when she retired.

David Chow acted as the technical and kung fu advisor, and guest-starred in the pilot as the Little Monk, Caine&#x27;s enemy at the climactic fight scene. His technical role was later undertaken by Kam Yuen, who guest-starred as Lin Wu in the s1e3 episode &quot;Blood Brother&quot; and as Wong Ti in the s3e1–2 episodes &quot;Blood of the Dragon&quot;. Part of Chow&#x27;s job was to add or eliminate fight scenes from the script, &quot;settle differences of opinion&quot; regarding their technical aspects among the martial artists participating in them, and make the scenes believable.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Kung Fu&quot; was created by Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander, directed and produced by Jerry Thorpe, and developed by Herman Miller, who was also a writer for, and co-producer of, the series. (For the series concept&#x27;s history, see Bruce Lee&#x27;s involvement.)

Spielman-Friedlander&#x27;s 160 page movie script was transformed by Jerry Thorpe and writer Herman Miller into a 90-minute TV movie (with commercial breaks, so it actually amounted to about 75 minutes of screen time). &quot;Since the rule of thumb on a script is that one page equals one minute, the script was literally cut in half.&quot;

Directed by Jerry Thorpe, it was broadcast on February 22, 1972 (just after the meeting of President Nixon with Chairman Mao), and rerun the following summer, to great acclaim: &quot;(...) ABC and Warner Brothers were deluged with letters, telephone calls and telegrams, all praising the show.&quot; ABC ordered just four more segments and placed them in what was called the &quot;death row,&quot; the Saturday night slot opposite &quot;All in the Family&quot;, on a monthly basis. Herman Miller developed the pilot into a series by writing the first three episodes, by including in the plotline Caine&#x27;s search for his missing brother, and by giving it a style to which following writers could adhere. After a very positive reception to the first three segments, in November 1972 the network contracted for 12 more episodes, dropped &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; and placed &quot;Kung Fu&quot; in the Thursday night slot at 9 p.m. The resultant good ratings led to the series&#x27; renovation for a second season.

The series&#x27; story editor was John Furia Jr. At the time a freelance writer for TV and movies who also worked in production, he had declined offers as story editor before until Jerry Thorpe approached him with &quot;Kung Fu.&quot; He had seen the pilot and was fascinated by it, so he accepted. The series didn&#x27;t have a stable team of writers, but freelance writers pitched their stories to the production; they were told not to include temple scenes. It was John Furia&#x27;s job to write them and make them relevant to the episode&#x27;s plot, based on the research material the production had collected.

Furia&#x27;s job also included &quot;to maintain and preserve historical accuracy in each script. To complicate matters, there is no single historical source on kung-fu upon which he can rely. He must make extensive research into various sources before he can render a story to be within the realms of truth. Furthermore, because the story involves an ethnic group, and the tempers of our time do not tolerate ignorance and bigotry, he must not only make sure that the historical information regarding the group is accurate, but that these people are presented with dignity and respect.&quot;

Questioned about whether having a half-Caucasian as a student at the Shaolin Temple (which did not accept foreigners) was historically accurate, John Furia Jr. declared: &quot;There is, of course, a certain amount of dramatic license involved in producing a show of this nature. As for David Carradine playing the part of a half-American half-Chinese, I can honestly say that we haven&#x27;t found anyone, before or since the series began, who can play the part better. One of the reasons for the success of the series is Carradine&#x27;s portrayal of Caine.&quot; As for the hiring of Asian actors for the secondary roles, he said: &quot;It not only adds authenticity, it&#x27;s only proper that it should be so. Our series, I believe, hires more Orientals than any series on TV.&quot;

===Broadcast===
The series aired on ABC from October 1972 to April 1975 for a total of 63 episodes. The series became one of the most popular television programs of the early 1970s, receiving widespread critical acclaim and commercial success upon its release.

On the week ending May 6, 1973, &quot;Kung Fu&quot; became the No.1 show on US television, drawing a regular audience of viewers. Around the same time, Bruce Lee&#x27;s Hollywood debut &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; was being completed. It was part of what became known as the &quot;chopsocky&quot; or &quot;kung fu craze&quot; after Hong Kong martial arts films such as &quot;Five Fingers of Death&quot; (&quot;King Boxer&quot;) and Bruce Lee&#x27;s &quot;Fists of Fury&quot; (&quot;The Big Boss&quot;) topped the US box office in early 1973.

In its first season, 1972–1973, &quot;Kung Fu&quot;″s pilot was first aired as an &quot;ABC Tuesday Movie of the Week&quot;, which placed it in the range of the top 20 programs of the season, as determined by Nielsen Media Research. After the pilot&#x27;s rerun in the summer, during the fall season, three more episodes were aired once a month on Saturday nights alternating with &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, against &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;Bridget Loves Bernie&quot;, which were among the top 10 programs of that season. The other 12 episodes ran on Thursday nights, when they ranked among the 30 first-rated shows and tied in ratings with &quot;The ABC Monday Night Movie&quot; and &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; during the winter season, losing in ratings to &quot;Ironside&quot;, which was at the same time slot during the fall and summer seasons.

In its second season, 1973–1974, it ran on Thursday nights, when it remained among the 30 first rated shows, together with &quot;CBS Thursday Night Movie&quot;, which was at the same time slot, and tied in ratings with &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, which ran on Saturday nights.

In its third and final season, 1974–1975, &quot;Kung Fu&quot;″s time slot changed three times, and it lost its place among the 30 first-rated shows. In the fall, it was moved to Saturdays night at 9 p.m., against CBS&#x27; &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, sitcoms rated in the top 20 of the season. Between the fall and winter seasons, it ran on Fridays at 8 p.m., which placed it against NBC&#x27;s sitcoms &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; and &quot;Chico and the Man&quot;, both rated in the top 10 of the season. Then in winter, &quot;Kung Fu&quot;&#x27;s time slot changed to Saturdays at 8 p.m., which placed it against CBS&#x27;s &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; (sitcoms rated in the season&#x27;s top 10), and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Emergency!&quot;, a series rated in the top 30 of that season, all of which were at the same time slot.

Contrary to some misconceptions, &quot;Kung Fu&quot; was not canceled. The series ended due to a combination of factors, among which the documentary &quot;The Tao of Caine&quot; cites the lead actor&#x27;s burnout, changes in the writing and shooting that altered some of the most appreciated characteristics of the show, and above all the changes in the time slot, which led to the audience&#x27;s decline. However, the most important factor was David Carradine&#x27;s decision to leave.

It has been said that Carradine left the show after sustaining several injuries that made it impossible for him to continue. While injuries were a feature of his career, Carradine&#x27;s decision to quit &quot;Kung Fu&quot; was influenced by the bad publicity that a drug-related incident attracted on him and which affected the ratings of the series, what Radames Pera described as sabotage. Carradine himself acknowledged that it had been detrimental to audience ratings.

From a broader point of view, Carradine&#x27;s decision stemmed from the fact that he, from the beginning, hadn&#x27;t wanted to commit long-term to a series or stay in it for an extended period, due to his foremost interest in pursuing a career in filmmaking, which he said led him to avoid signing a regular contract that would have bound him for five years. At any rate, Carradine&#x27;s warning to the production team that the third season was going to be his last one allowed the writers to plan the final episodes so that all of the remaining story arcs regarding Caine and his brother could be brought to a satisfying end. In his commentary to the episode &quot;Full Circle&quot;, Carradine regretted his decision to leave, because of how that had affected the series&#x27; crew.

&quot;Kung Fu&quot; started to broadcast in syndication on September 1, 1979, on 23 local channels.

The series was later broadcast on cable television by the TNT channel, on weeknights at 7 p.m., ET.

===International broadcast===

===Sets===
The series was filmed at the Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank (Laramie Street, the Backlot, and several stages), Old Tucson Studios, and on locations like Vasquez Rocks, the 20th Century Fox Ranch (Malibu Creek State Park), and the sand dunes in the Yuma Desert for the opening and closing credits.

The Shaolin Monastery which appeared in flashbacks was originally a set used for the 1967 film &quot;Camelot&quot;. It was inexpensively and effectively converted for the setting in China, by the Academy Award nominee Eugène Lourié as art director; the set decorator was the Academy Award nominee Ralph S. Hurst.

Even if &quot;Camelot&quot; won an Academy Award for its art direction and set decoration, the expensive castle (made with wooden beams, wooden frame structures, and building timber covered with faux stone siding) was criticized for its unspecific style placed in a landscape evidently Californian, which resulted in that castle being the last attempt for a studio to construct a large scale set that represented a foreign location. By November 1971, when Jerry Thorpe asked Eugène Lourié to design the art for &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, the castle was derelict to the point that Lourié believed that it still stood only because the cost of demolishing it would be prohibitive.

Working with the reduced budget of a TV production was a challenge, but Lourié had learned in France how to work with little money for sets. He was both interested and intrigued by the story, as the action moved back and forth between the Wild West&#x27;s present and the memories of the Shaolin temple. Lourié decided to emphasize that contrast visually. The practical need for making the project monetarily viable meant style compromises.

With that in mind, the castle&#x27;s nonspecific architectural style was perfect to give it a Chinese look for Western eyes, by adding characteristic roofs, a front wall with a massive wood-carved door, and brick walls with ceramic-grilled windows, while its terraces and stairs were fit for the stagings of the kung fu training sequences. For the temple&#x27;s interiors, Lourié opted for showing only a portion of the set and let the viewers complete it in their minds. He decided on a church-like appearance, with a Buddhist mural on the back wall, multileveled wooden candleholders and burning candles between columns, a constant haze, and the projection of strong rays of light as if coming through high church windows.

That visual conception made it unnecessary to build long and high stone walls for those sets, especially because the studio offered &quot;Kung Fu&quot; a large stage on which there was a standing set of the big hall from &quot;Camelot&quot;. That presented the advantage of ready-made stone walls if the side wings of the temple were to appear in a take. The scenes among the flickering candles would become a signature of the series. For other Chinese sets, he used carved wooden partitions to enhance plain walls, or giant sculptured lions to give simple gardens an aura of grandeur.

For the railroad camp location, a place close to Hollywood was needed, so the well-known Vasquez Rocks were chosen. As for the Western scenes, the old western streets on the Warners lot were easily adaptable to the series&#x27; multiple requirements. Lourié&#x27;s solution of the temple and the other sets both in budgetary and visual terms was key in getting the go-ahead for the movie pilot from the production department, and for the subsequent series.

In his memoir, Eugène Lourié praises Jerry Thorpe&#x27;s vision, courage and inventiveness to undertake the &quot;Kung Fu&quot; project with a reduced TV budget. At the minute 4:32 of the documentary &quot;The Tao of Caine&quot;, Jerry Thorpe says about him: &quot;The art director, Eugène Lourié, his talents were unending. He converted a medieval castle that had been built for &quot;Camelot&quot; on the backlot into an AD 2nd to 3rd century Shaolin monastery, for a buck and a quarter. He cannibalized every scene dock in the industry. It was amazing to watch.&quot;

The Camelot Castle, already converted into a Shaolin temple and with some additions, became a main set for the 1973 musical &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; during its 1972 April to June shooting period.

From late 1972 to early 1975, it became again a Shaolin temple while the &quot;Kung Fu&quot; episodes were in production, with the Emmy Award winner Antony Mondello and John Lamphear as set decorators.

When visiting the backlot in 1980, Lourié was sorry to find out that a large number of the western streets had been bulldozed. As for the imposing castle/temple/lamasery, it lasted for a few more years until it was torn down and substituted by a parking lot and the Bridge offices building (1994).

===Special effects===
The series used slow-motion effects for the action sequences, which Warner Brothers had previously utilized in the 1969 Sam Peckinpah film &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; and were also subsequently utilized for the action sequences in the science-fiction series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;.

===Soundtrack===

The music for the opening and closing titles, as well as the incidental music, was composed by Jim Helms.

The series associate producer (later producer) Alex Beaton selected him after listening to several composer demos when the pilot was in development. Helms, a guitarist and arranger, scored the pilot with a team of only eleven musicians. The result was mostly atmospheric instead of melodic, with a koto as the predominant instrument. This score did not include &quot;Caine&#x27;s Theme&quot;, which was added when the series began airing in 1972, in the opening and closing titles. That signature theme had two unusual characteristics: through the first season it was revised and re-recorded several times, and the sound palette comprised about 19 musicians per session only. Even if half of them were string players, woodwinds, keyboard, and percussion were always more prominent.

The flute themes were performed by Sheridon Stokes on alto recorder, since the type of bamboo flute featured in the series wasn&#x27;t chromatic and was deemed impractical for scoring purposes. The constant presence of a harpsichord played by Mike Lang helped to set the series in the 19th century. The percussion instruments included a waterphone, Chinese tom-toms, Chinese opera bells, woodblocks, and antique Chinese &quot;dharma bells&quot; (Asian nested bells). The percussionist Emil Richards collected over 90 of them and used them often for microtonal glisses. Everything resulted in an Eastern-Western combination that was unique in American television. &quot;Variety&quot; referred to Helms&#x27; work as &quot;especially interesting... sensitive... a decided asset.&quot;

Given the success of &quot;Kung Fu&quot;″s first season, Warner Bros. Records released internationally in December 1973 a &quot;concept album&quot; of dialogue and music from the show, based on the pilot and the first nine episodes; &quot;Caine&#x27;s Theme&quot; was also released as a single. The record used an expanded 45-piece orchestra for the musical selections and a group of eight musicians for the incidental music underscoring dialogue taken from the Shaolin temple sequences. The LP was re-released in CD format in 2010, accompanied by the &quot;Man in the Wilderness&quot; movie soundtrack.

&quot;Caine&#x27;s Theme&quot; (with different arrangements) was included in the TV and film music compilations by Jack Hawkins his Orchestra and Singers (UK, 1974), Jack Parnell and his Orchestra (UK, 1975), and The Film Studio Orchestra (Japan, 1976).

==Question of Bruce Lee&#x27;s involvement==
In her memoirs, Bruce Lee&#x27;s widow, Linda Lee Cadwell, asserts that Lee created the concept for the series, which was then stolen by Warner Bros.: &quot;Even before this [Longstreet], Warner Brothers had suddenly caught on to the fact that kung fu itself had captured the public&#x27;s imagination and decided to launch a TV series,&quot; she writes. &quot;Bruce himself had been working on the idea of a Shaolin priest, a master of kung fu, who would roam America and find himself involved in various exploits. The studio contacted him and he was soon deeply involved. He gave them numerous ideas, many of which were eventually incorporated in the resulting TV success, Kung Fu, starring actor David Carradine.&quot; (Linda Lee, &quot;The Man Only I Knew&quot;, pp. 130–31.). There is circumstantial evidence for this in a December 8, 1971, television interview that Bruce Lee gave on &quot;The Pierre Berton Show&quot;. In the interview, Lee stated that he had developed a concept for a television series called &quot;The Warrior&quot;, meant to star himself, about a martial artist in the American Old West (the same concept as &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, which aired the following year), but that he was having trouble pitching it to Warner Brothers and Paramount.

In the interview, Pierre Berton commented, &quot;There&#x27;s a pretty good chance that you&#x27;ll get a TV series in the States called &#x27;The Warrior&#x27;, in it, where you use what, the Martial Arts in Western setting?&quot;

Lee responded, &quot;That was the original idea, ...both of them [Warner and Paramount], I think, they want me to be in a modernized type of a thing, and they think that the Western type of thing is out. Whereas I want to do the Western. Because, you see, how else can you justify all of the punching and kicking and violence, except in the period of the West?&quot;

Later in the interview, Berton asked Lee about &quot;the problems that you face as a Chinese hero in an American series. Have people come up in the industry and said &#x27;well, we don&#x27;t know how the audience are going to take a non-American&#x27;?&quot;

Lee replied, &quot;Well, such question has been raised, in fact, it is being discussed. That is why &quot;The Warrior&quot; is probably not going to be on.&quot; Lee adds, &quot;They think that business-wise it is a risk. I don&#x27;t blame them. If the situation were reversed, and an American star were to come to Hong Kong, and I was the man with the money, I would have my own concerns as to whether the acceptance would be there.&quot;

However, Bruce Lee was undoubtedly considered for the starring role, and David Carradine himself in a 1989 interview and in his book &quot;Spirit of Shaolin&quot;, said that Bruce Lee was passed over for the role. It is alleged that an unnamed ABC executive said &quot;You can&#x27;t make a star out of a five-foot-six Chinese actor.&quot;

According to biographer Matthew Polly, Bruce Lee did not invent the &quot;Kung Fu&quot; TV series. Ed Spielman created the character of Kwai Chang Caine, and the movie treatment Spielman wrote with Howard Friedlander in 1969 was the origin of the pilot and subsequent series.

Spielman first wrote a treatment about a samurai who travels to China and learns kung fu. Around 1967, he gave it to his partner Howard Friedlander, who suggested turning it into a Western; Spielman then decided to make the leading character into a half-American, half-Chinese Shaolin monk. In 1969 the William Morris agent Peter Lampack put the treatment into the knowledge of Fred Weintraub, at the time an executive at Warner Brothers and later the producer of &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;: &quot;As a New York-based production executive at Warner Bros. Pictures, it was my job to develop projects to appeal to the youth market. From the mountain of potential projects sent to me weekly, I unearthed a treatment for a feature length film by a couple of writers named Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander called &quot;The Way of the Tiger, The Sign of the Dragon&quot;. It was an intriguing East-meets-Western tale of a young Shaolin monk from China roaming the American West of the 1800s, righting wrongs with pacifist, Eastern philosophy. And if that failed, kicking serious cowboy butt with nothing but his hands and feet. I liked the idea and gave the boys something like $3,800 to write a screenplay. At about that time, Warner Bros. made the decision to change their base of operations and moved me from New York to Hollywood.&quot; He received the finished script on April 30, 1970. Later through his friend Sy Weintraub (no relation), Weintraub met Bruce Lee and considering him ideal for the part tried to put the script into development with him as the leading actor, but was rejected. According to Howard Friedlander, the film was to be filmed in Durango, Mexico, for the Western scenes, and Taiwan for the Chinese scenes. Its budget had been calculated as $18 million (over $124 million in 2022 dollars). Friedlander blamed the arrival of Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown as senior executives at Warners Bros. for the cancellation of the movie project, because &quot;the general consensus was that the public would not be willing to accept a Chinese hero.&quot;

While Bruce Lee was in Thailand filming &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, Weintraub brought the script to Tom Kuhn, head of the Warner Bros. TV division, who liked it. Warner Bros. and ABC announced their TV deal for &quot;Kung Fu&quot; on July 22, 1971, and started pre-production (including casting). The air date was scheduled for February 22, 1972, with production starting on December 15, 1971. Bruce Lee, having arrived back from Thailand, auditioned for the part of Caine, but the studio was reluctant to hire a Chinese actor, having concerns with his accent, his intense personality, considered not suitable to portray a quiet, serene character, and also because he was &quot;too authentic&quot;.

In early October 1971, a month before Warner Brothers officially designated David Carradine for the role of Caine, Warner Brothers executive Ted Ashley, who saw Bruce Lee&#x27;s potential and didn&#x27;t want to lose him to Paramount, offered him an exclusive development deal to create his own TV program, which included an advance of &quot;$25,000 (or $152,000 in 2017 dollars) - enough money to pay off most of his mortgage.&quot; Bruce Lee presented a treatment describing a show called &quot;Ah Sahm&quot;, which he later retitled &quot;The Warrior&quot;. Bruce Lee did not sign Ashley&#x27;s deal, preferring to see how &quot;The Big Boss&quot; performed in theaters. When the movie was a smashing success, he abandoned his plans to be a TV star and instead focused on the big screen. Decades later in 2019, Lee&#x27;s series concept would be produced as &quot;Warrior&quot; on Cinemax.

==Casting controversy==
&quot;Kung Fu&quot; has been called an example of yellowface and a prominent case of whitewashing.

Most of the controversy lies in the allegation that the series&#x27; idea was stolen from Bruce Lee, but also in the fact that he was not cast for the leading role, and that decision had racial connotations. The &quot;steal&quot; theory has become widespread, both in academia and in the media, even internationally.

The casting for the leading role when the project was still a feature film had considered (among others) James Coburn, who was preferred by Ed Spielman. When the script became an ABC Movie of the Week, the casting process considered (among others) Bruce Lee, Mako, and George Takei. After having &quot;sought every Asian in Hollywood, because you didn&#x27;t have to be super bright to know what was coming,&quot; and found none that could carry the series, they turned to the American side of the character and began auditioning white actors, including William Smith and John Saxon. Just two weeks before the pilot&#x27;s filming started, David Carradine obtained the role at his second audition.

At the time, George Takei and the Association of Asian Pacific American Artists (AAPAA) filed a formal complaint for unfair hiring practices. They wanted an Asian actor in the leading role and a Chinese historical advisor; only the second demand was conceded. The Asian acting community was initially displeased, but with so few opportunities for Asian actors at the time, many felt it was better to have a successful show that could be a steady source of work for them in secondary roles than having none at all. Actor James Hong (who was the AAPAA&#x27;s president), said: &quot;As the show went on, we realized it was a great source of employment for the Asian acting community.&quot;

===Representation of women and ethnic groups===
The series has been considered a commentary on race relations in the 1970s, both for its casting as for the depiction of discrimination against minorities. It is noteworthy that race issues also affected the casting of secondary characters whereas gender inequality showed in their stories.

France Nuyen and Nancy Kwan, both Eurasian, played Chinese characters, the first one accepting being given in marriage as payment for service her husband was hired to perform (s3e3), the other one preferring to be a concubine to the emperor rather than the wife of the warlord who had raped her, who was played by Stefan Gierasch, wearing prosthetic makeup (s2e22–23). Barbara Hershey appeared as a Eurasian woman who flees forced marriage to a warlord played by Khigh Dhiegh (born Kenneth Dickerson), and is denied admission to the Shaolin temple as a student because &quot;You are female – You are also of mixed blood&quot; (s3e10–11). On the other hand, American women are sometimes portrayed as dependant or even unable to survive without men (s1e14, s2e16, s3e4), but also as independent individuals, like entrepreneurs (s3e23), landowners (s2e14, s3e1–2), ranchers (s2e12, s3e3) or craftswomen (s1e3), according to the feminist currents of the time. Notably, Asian women are portrayed that way on occasion (s1e5, s1e8), and not just in stereotypical or subservient roles.

Given that the series&#x27; action happens mostly in the 19th century California, black people appear as important characters in just a few episodes (s1e13, s2e1, s2e16, s3e18, s3e24), as at the time they were a small portion of the state&#x27;s population, yet all of the episodes have to do with them facing discrimination. Interestingly, when the consequences of the American Civil War are mentioned, they are in the context of defeat and vengeance (s1e4, s2e3, s3e24), not of the abolition of slavery.

Regarding Native Americans, as it was usual at the time, they are mostly portrayed by non-Native actors, usually from the Hispanic community and also by Whites (s2e6), whereas the Hispanics themselves appear mostly when Caine visits towns in New Mexico or Mexico (s2e3, s2e4, s3e14), even if at the time there was an important Hispanic presence in the state. The portrayal of Native Americans varies from the stereotypical faceless villains (s1e1, s1e2), to objects of persecution and discrimination (s2e5, s3e5) to a co-leading character in the s1e15 episode &quot;The Ancient Warrior,&quot; the only one with a Native actor billed in the opening credits, which precisely deals with the extermination of a whole tribe. The absence of Native actors and the cultural misrepresentation issue wasn&#x27;t unique to this series nor to its time; it has led the National Congress of American Indians to pass a resolution on the subject as recently as 2017.

===Representation of Asians===
East Asian, or rather Chinese portrayal in the series remains a problematic subject. Academic studies tend to mention the show in the context of discrimination against Asians in American society and entertainment.
Professor Jun Xing (Chun Hsing in Library of Congress&#x27; cataloging) states that segregating actors by roles seems reasonable when ethnic characters are cast, but there is a double standard in which Asians cannot play roles designated as White, whereas Caucasian actors cross into ones representing every other race, showing that in movies American people are not every color, but Black and White. Also, as there is an East/West dichotomy, Asians are not seen as Americans. With that in mind, to maintain the double standard, &quot;Eurasian characters have become Hollywood&#x27;s favorite creations. These mixed-race characters obviously allow white actors and actresses, with minimum makeup, to steal major roles from Asians.&quot; And puts &quot;Kung Fu&quot; as the &quot;best example&quot; of that, noting Bruce Lee&#x27;s involvement.

Professor Hye Seung Chung exemplifies Asian representation in American film and television, and the roles Asian actors were allowed to play, with the case of Philip Ahn, who, being the son of a Korean national hero, spent his career playing minor and secondary characters, usually Japanese and Chinese. On page 31, she compares a letter from an admirer of Ahn&#x27;s work as Master Kan with playwright Frank Chin&#x27;s attack on the series in a 1974 The New York Times article, when he states that apes&#x27; roles in movies had evolved better than Chinese images in media. Even if Professor Chung states on page 177 that &quot;&quot;Kung Fu&quot; was a groundbreaking series produced by Warner Bros. that intermixed the martial arts genre with Wild West iconography, expanding the syntax of the television western to accommodate &quot;foreign&quot; elements at the scenographic and narrative levels,&quot; her analysis decries the way the Kan character is depicted as &quot;emasculated,&quot; stereotyped in various ways, and she mentions that Bruce Lee was not cast in the leading role.

Also, the series itself lacks historical and cultural accuracy in this matter. Through the episodes, the writers made mistakes regarding the order of Chinese names, and about who was the Emperor in China at the series&#x27; time period. When Japanese elements appear, they are unlikely to be known or happen at the said time: in s3e12, the boy Caine watches a Noh performance in a mandarin&#x27;s mansion, when Japan was still an isolationist country. In s2e2, among three Japanese characters, there is a woman who has been married to an Englishman for over 15 years, when British subjects had been allowed to reside in Japan only since 1862–1863; also Caine knows well what a ninja is, just ten years after Japan&#x27;s opening to international relations. Most importantly, the series&#x27; Shaolin priests teach Taoist and Confucian philosophy, whereas the actual Shaolin monks are Buddhist. However, the absence of allusions to Joseon Korea is correct, as immigrants from that kingdom arrived in America after 1884.

Another issue that has come under the scrutiny of academia and the media, which is not exclusive to this series, is the fact that Asian actors of several nationalities and ethnicities appeared in the &quot;Kung Fu&quot; main or guest cast playing Chinese characters, &quot;interchangeably&quot;. Professor Chung on page 16-17 exemplifies this situation that Asian actors in the American entertainment industry face with the careers of two &quot;Kung Fu&quot; cast members, Philip Ahn (Korean) and Richard Loo (Hawaii-born Chinese American) who so often played Japanese villains in war movies that international magazine articles about them confused their pictures: &quot;This confusion speaks to the interchangeability of Asian actors, regardless of nationality and ethnicity, which was fostered by an industry insensitive to the diversities and differences within the same racial group.&quot; In an early article about the series, both actors are referred to and they call their characters &quot;Orientals&quot;. Professors Kent A. Ono and Vincent N. Pham call that perceived interchangeability &quot;implicit yellowface&quot;. It is a problem that, together with whitewashing has continued into present times and is noticed internationally. Regarding this &quot;interchangeability&quot; issue, given the historic period in which &quot;Kung Fu&quot; is set, Koreans couldn&#x27;t have appeared, and Japanese perhaps shouldn&#x27;t have, as in the 1870s&#x27; America there were just 55 Japanese immigrants registered. Yet in the episode s2e2 it is established through dialogue, costume, and cultural details that the Japanese are not the same as Chinese, and they are played by actors of Japanese ancestry.

Radames Pera, who played young Caine, mentioned in 2021, &quot;They did the best they could at the time...They were taking heat from the Asian community from the onset. So they actually made a deal with some of the representatives from Asian American community to hire everybody in town, whether they were Korean, Japanese, Chinese, or Filipino who had a SAG card. They also gave cards to those who didn&#x27;t have one by giving them their first job in a union production. Literally every Asian actor in town worked on that show.&quot;

===Recapitulation===

That guy is me,&#x27; Spielman says. &#x27;That Caine character is me in a way, just like Siegel and Shuster did Superman. He was always Eurasian; he always didn&#x27;t fit in. So, according to its creator, it was not a maneuver that would make it fit for a White actor, even if his first choice for the role had been James Coburn. Regarding the casting process, the production team says they did try to cast an Asian actor but none was adequate for the role, including Bruce Lee. John Furia Jr. asserted that &quot;the concept of the series was a man who was not involved, a man who avoided action at almost any cost, a very quiet, seemingly passive man.&quot; Tom Kuhn, besides claiming that Lee&#x27;s speech was hard to understand, said: &quot;It did occur to me that this part was rather cerebral, a guy who only fights when he&#x27;s absolutely cornered.&quot; Even Fred Weintraub, who had lobbied for Lee since the beginning, noted that they needed an actor &quot;to portray the sense of quiet serenity that Caine possessed, a quality that driven and intense Bruce was not known for.&quot; Still, both Kuhn and Weintraub admitted that &quot;the powers that be&quot; were unwilling to hire an Asian actor per se.

Academic studies about Asian representation in American entertainment claim that the casting of the leading role and even the portrayal of the Chinese characters by Asian actors followed generalized discriminatory patterns. Put in a historical context in which White actors were free to play Asian, Eurasian and other ethnicities&#x27; roles, whereas Asian, Eurasian and mixed-race actors played the stereotypical Asian roles left but never White roles, anti-miscegenation laws had been repealed just in 1967, the Hays Code finally abandoned in 1968, and whitewashing has continued into the 21st century, their authors simply can&#x27;t believe that the casting of a White actor for a Eurasian role in 1971 could have had any other cause than inveterate racism, much less when Bruce Lee was involved.

The media continues to list this show as racist, not for its contents but because future star Bruce Lee wasn&#x27;t cast in a role that perhaps wasn&#x27;t suited for him, as an actor, in November–December 1971, and because of the rooted belief that the idea for the series was &quot;stolen&quot; from him.

In consequence, the new show takes the name of the original one while completely separating itself from it, instead of continuing its story or attempting to build upon its legacy, claiming with good reason that their aim is improving Asian community&#x27;s representation and visibility.

Interestingly, in the s1e3 episode &quot;Blood Brother,&quot; Kwai Chang Caine pleads for his compatriots to do that, as a matter of life and death.
(Caine has uncovered a hate crime against an old condisciple. An inquest ensues, which could lead to a possible, but unlikely indictment. Caine urges a Chinese man who has been assaulted by the murderers to present himself at the proceeding.)
Placed in a turning point of the history of American society and television, being the last show in American television with a leading character in yellowface, obscures what the show did accomplish.
In a time when Asian actors were largely ignored, and usually played minor and openly stereotypical roles, &quot;Kung Fu&quot; was exceptional for consistently presenting them as not stereotypical characters and for being a steady job source for Asian actors, which was acknowledged by members of the cast and the AAPAA&#x27;s president James Hong. The episodes s3e8, s3e10–11, s3e15 and s3e22, set in China, had a mostly Asian American cast. Also, the show was clear in denouncing anti-Chinese racism, including hate crimes (s1e3), and pointed at historical events ignored in popular culture, like the Page Act of 1875 that basically forbade the immigration of East Asian women (s1e8), or the harsh labor conditions of the Chinese immigrants who built the transcontinental railroad (pilot, s3e9). Despite its historical inaccuracies, the series&#x27; dialogue was greatly based on Chinese philosophy, which gave viewers an introduction to its spiritual values, and its dramatic appeal made it the recipient of international accolades.

===Critical response===

Rotten Tomatoes calls the series &quot;influential&quot;, and Metacritic in describing it says: &quot;A man of peace, though trained to defend himself, Caine always made an attempt to address situations in a way that was morally acceptable to his beliefs, and to resolve them through [the] least violent means possible. His journey is not only one across the frontier of America but one through the light and dark areas of the soul as well.&quot;

In a May 1973 &quot;Black Belt&quot; magazine interview with John Furia Jr., the author Jon Shirota speaks about the critical response in these terms: &quot;Even the TV critics, customarily very reserved and cautious with their appraisals, acclaimed the show [the first segment] as one of the year&#x27;s best. (...) One critic wrote that the success of &quot;Kung-Fu&quot; may be attributed to the very thing the producers were afraid of: the public&#x27;s not knowing what the series was about. &#x27;Actually,&#x27; said the critic, &#x27;it adds a certain amount of unpredictability and suspense to the plot. It is unlike most of the western heroes whose faces are like the book you&#x27;ve already read.&#x27; Another critic said that a story like &quot;Kung-Fu&quot; could never have been made into a movie 10 years ago because no one would have cared about a bunch of coolies. &#x27;It is only now,&#x27; he quipped, &#x27;that we are giving true credit to history.

==Home media==
Warner Home Video released the entire series on DVD in Region 1 between 2004 and 2005.

On November 14, 2017, Warner Home Video re-released all three seasons, as well as the complete series set on DVD in Region 1.

The extras include audio commentary by David Carradine on four episodes of the series (s2e1 &quot;The Well&quot;, s2e14 &quot;A Dream Within a Dream&quot;, s3e2 &quot;Blood of the Dragon - 2&quot;, s3e21 &quot;Full Circle&quot;), &quot;Zen &amp; Now: A Dinner With David Carradine And Friends&quot; (Guests: Hal Sparks, Sifu Rob Moses, Vivica A.

The series is also available online on Amazon Prime Video and iTunes (including pilot), and on Google TV.

==Revivals==

===&quot;Kung Fu: The Movie&quot;===
In &quot;Kung Fu: The Movie&quot; (1986) Caine (again played by Carradine) is forced to fight his hitherto unknown son, Chung Wang (played by Brandon Lee). Herbie Pilato in &quot;The Kung Fu Book of Caine&quot; (page 157) also comments that Bruce Lee&#x27;s son, Brandon Lee, was involved in sequels related to the series:
The late Brandon Lee, son of Bruce Lee, played Caine&#x27;s son, Chung Wang. Toward the end of the film, Chung Wang asks Caine if he is his father. The question seems somewhat ironic since—in real life—Brandon&#x27;s father was a contender for the role of Caine in the series. After Bruce Lee lost the part to Carradine, he went back to Hong Kong, where he made &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, the film that began his legendary career in martial arts movies.
===&quot;Kung Fu: The Next Generation&quot;===
In &quot;Kung Fu: The Next Generation&quot; (1987), the story moves to the present day and centers on the story of Kwai Chang &quot;Johnny&quot; Caine (Brandon Lee), who is the great-great-grandson of Kwai Chang Caine, and the difficult relationship he has with his father, also named Kwai Chang (David Darlow). In an attempt to connect with his son, Caine Sr. takes him to Silver Creek, a ghost town, the place where their ancestor spent his last years. They talk about how Caine arrived there, became the &quot;wise man of the town&quot;, and how he passed away.
&quot;So I guess he died here, right?&quot;&quot;That&#x27;s the strange thing. One evening in his garden his heart failed him. His wife went to fetch the doctor. When she returned, Kwai Chang was gone.&quot;&quot;Where did he go?&quot;&quot;No one really knows.&quot;

As Johnny has involved himself with an operation of burglary and arms trafficking, the perfectionist father and the rebellious son need to put their differences aside to fight the criminals and save Johnny from prison.
===&quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot;===
Two decades after the first series ended, a second, related series titled &quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot; running in syndication followed the adventures of Kwai Chang Caine&#x27;s grandson, also named Kwai Chang Caine. It again starred Carradine, this time as the grandson of the original Caine, and introduced Chris Potter as his son. Caine&#x27;s mentor was played by Kim Chan as Lo Si (The Ancient) / Ping Hai. The second series ran for four years, from 1993 to 1997.
===Feature film===
In June 2006, Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander announced that a feature film (which would serve as a prequel to the original &quot;Kung Fu&quot; series and take place in China) was in development. In 2007, Max Makowski planned to make the film edgier than the original television series. Actor-director Bill Paxton was in talks to direct the adaptation of the TV series. Baz Luhrmann was in talks to direct the film in 2014, and if the deal was made, Luhrmann was to rewrite the film&#x27;s script. In 2020, 87North Productions announced development of a contemporary feature film version of the series with creator Spielman and Stephen L&#x27;Hereaux producing through his Solipsist Film company and David Leitch directing.
===2021 reboot===

A re-imagining of the original series, simply titled &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, aired on The CW in April 2021. The show is produced by Greg Berlanti.

The series is written by Christina M. Kim and Martin Gero and sees a quarter-life crisis causing a young Chinese-American woman named Nicky, played by Olivia Liang, to drop out of college and take up residence in an isolated monastery in China. When she returns to find her hometown overrun with crime and corruption, she uses her martial arts skills and Shaolin values to protect her community and bring criminals to justice, all while searching for the assassin who killed her Shaolin mentor and now is targeting her.

The show stars Olivia Liang as Nicky; Tzi Ma and Kheng Hua Tan as Jin Chen and Mei-Li, her restaurateur parents whose secrets threaten to destroy their lives; Jon Prasida as Ryan Chen, a quick-witted medical student and Nicky&#x27;s younger brother; Shannon Dang as Althea Chen, Nicky&#x27;s larger-than-life older sister who is newly engaged and on her way to planning her dream Chinese wedding; and Eddie Liu as Henry Chu, a martial arts instructor and Chinese art history buff who has instant chemistry with Nicky. Gavin Stenhouse was cast as Evan Hartley, a highly successful assistant district attorney who still has a soft spot for his first love, Nicky; and Yvonne Chapman was cast as Zhilan, a cryptic woman with deep criminal ties and a mysterious connection to the Shaolin monastery where Nicky trained in kung fu.

<text>Tommy Tutone is an American power pop band, known for its 1981 song &quot;867-5309/Jenny&quot;, which peaked at #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The band&#x27;s lead singer, rhythm guitarist, and occasional keyboardist is Tommy Heath. He is the only active original member currently touring as Tommy Tutone. Heath grew up in Philadelphia, Texas, and Montana before moving to San Francisco during the Summer of Love to become a hippie. There, he formed the band with Jim Keller and Terry Nails in 1978, naming it after his nickname. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Angel Say No&quot;, was released in 1980 and reached the top 40, and they opened for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on his US tour for &quot;Damn the Torpedoes&quot;. 

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Tommy Tutone 2&quot;, was released in 1981 and featured &quot;867-5309/Jenny&quot;. The song became so popular that people in the United States still prank call the number and ask for Jenny today. In 2006, VH1 named it the 36th-greatest song of the 1980s. 

, Heath is living in Portland, Oregon, and back touring as Tommy Tutone. A new studio album is set to release in fall 2024.

==History==
Tommy Heath and Jim Keller founded the band in 1978 along with bassist Terry Nails (Steve Jones, Ozzy Osbourne), with Heath acting as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, also playing keyboards on occasion. Keller played lead guitar and Nails played bass and provided supporting vocals. Heath and Keller were the only constant members of Tommy Tutone, while the lineup featured a rotating membership of bassists and drummers. 

Bassist Jon Lyons, who performed on &quot;867-5309/Jenny&quot;, replaced founding member Terry Nails, but was soon himself replaced by Greg Sutton, Pete Costello, and in 1988 Jimmy James. Mona Gnader, the bassist in Sammy Hagar&#x27;s The Waboritas band, played with the band as well. Original drummer Kenny Johnson (of Chris Isaak&#x27;s band) was replaced by Mickey Shine (Clover and the first Elvis Costello album), then Victor Carberry for the band&#x27;s second album, and later Jerry Angel. John Cowsill of The Cowsills played percussion (and sang) on &quot;867-5309/Jenny&quot;. 

From 2001 to 2010, the band consisted of Heath, Jimmy James, guitarist Greg Georgeson, and drummer Andy Gauthier. In 2007, the band signed a recording contract with Spectra Records. By 2012, Tommy Heath had become a computer analyst and software engineer and moved to Portland, Oregon. 

In 2017, with the addition of Steve Fister (Steppenwolf, Lita Ford) on guitar, Jimmy James switched to drums and the band released the single &quot;My Little Red Book&quot;.

Jim Keller went on to become the director of Philip Glass&#x27;s publishing company, Dunvagen Music Publishers. He still performs in New York City.

In 2019, the band released their first studio album since 1998, &quot;Beautiful Ending&quot;.

In 2024, the band is reunited and touring. A new studio album will be released in the fall entitled &quot;New Wave Americana&quot;.

<doc id="481532" wikidata="Q206398" url="?curid=481532" title="Coat of arms of Costa Rica">
<text>The official coat of arms of the Republic of Costa Rica was designed in 1848, with modifications in 1906, 1964, and 1998. The latest change was the addition of smoke to distinguish the three volcanoes.

== Pre-1821 colony of Spanish Empire ==
Before 1821, Costa Rica was part of the Spanish Empire and did not have a local coat of arms. The arms of the reigning monarch were used instead. The only city that had a local coat of arms was the city of Cartago, awarded by King Phillip II in 1565. After its independence from Spain in 1821, Costa Rica established different government boards trying to decide its future, debating between being independent (republicans) or join the Mexican Empire (imperialists). Lack of decision led to the Battle of Ochomogo on 5 April 1823, with the decision to remain independent and moving the capital city from Cartago to San José. Due to the long distances and difficult communication at the time, imperialists realized the Mexican Empire no longer existed since March 1823.

== Federal and state arms ==
In March 1824, when Costa Rica joined the United Provinces of Central America arms promulgated by the new republic&#x27;s constitution became the arms of the State of Costa Rica. This coat of arms consists of a triangle, in which five volcanoes rise out of the sea symbolizing the five member states of the United Provinces; above the volcanoes is a shining red Phrygian cap and a rainbow. This coat of arms with small changes is still used by the national coat of arms of El Salvador and Nicaragua.

On 2 November 1824, Costa Rica adopted its first coat of arms as a state within the federation which showed the right side of a naked male&#x27;s chest and extended arm surrounded by a circle of green mountains and the legend free state of Costa Rica.

== Arms of an independent state ==
In 1840, after Costa Rica&#x27;s withdrawal from the federation, a new coat of arms was adopted, the first for Costa Rica as a sovereign and independent state. It consisted of an eight-pointed shining star in a blue field surrounded by a yellow circle with the legend State of Costa Rica. This coat of arms was suppressed in 1842 by Francisco Morazán during his failed bid to reunite the Federal Republic of Central America. The 1824 arms were used during this period.

==Historical coat of arms of the republic==

The basis of the current national coat of arms of Costa Rica was adopted 29 September 1848, during the presidency of Dr Jose Maria Castro Madriz together with the new flag. Both designs are attributed to Pacifica Fernandez, wife of Mr Castro Madriz. These arms were significantly modified by law number 18 of 27 November 1906, which eliminated the military symbols, national flags and horn of plenty contained in the 1848 design.

In 1964 two stars were added to the original five in order to complete seven, which by then was the number of provinces of the country. In 1848, when the original design was adopted the current provinces of Puntarenas and Limon had not reached that status.

On 5 May 1998, by Executive Decree No. 26853-SP, the coat of arms was given its current form, including the smoking volcanoes. Before this date, the three mountains did not show smoke coming out of their tops.

As officially described, the coat of arms represents: three volcanoes (one for each of the three mountain ranges in the country) and an extensive valley between two oceans (Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea) with a merchant ship in each one (representing the maritime history of the country). In the horizon a rising sun. All are surrounded by a golden frame with golden beads (coffee). Two palms close the arms joined by a white ribbon with the motto &quot;República de Costa Rica&quot; in gold. An arch of seven stars represent the provinces of the republic. The arms are crowned by a blue ribbon with the motto &quot;America Central&quot;.

<doc id="481537" wikidata="Q468780" url="?curid=481537" title="Liu Shan">
<text>Liu Shan (, 207–271), courtesy name Gongsi, was the second and last emperor of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period. As he ascended the throne at the age of 16, Liu Shan was entrusted to the care of the Chancellor Zhuge Liang and Imperial Secretariat Li Yan. His reign of 40 years was the longest of all emperors in the Three Kingdoms era. During Liu Shan&#x27;s reign, many campaigns were led against the rival state of Cao Wei, primarily by Zhuge Liang and his successor Jiang Wei, but to little avail, due to their drastic mismatch in terms of population and geographic extent. Liu Shan eventually surrendered to Wei in 263 after Deng Ai led a surprise attack on the Shu capital Chengdu. He was quickly relocated to the Wei capital at Luoyang, and enfeoffed as &quot;Duke Anle&quot;. There he enjoyed his last years peacefully before dying in 271, most probably of natural causes.

Widely known to later generations by his infant name &quot;Adou&quot; (), Liu Shan was commonly perceived as an incapable ruler. He was also accused of indulging in pleasures while neglecting state affairs, allowing corrupt officials to take power. Some modern scholars have taken a more positive view towards Liu Shan&#x27;s capability, as Liu Shan&#x27;s long reign in Shu Han was free of bloody court coups unlike its rivals. Nevertheless, the name &quot;Adou&quot; is today still commonly used in Chinese as an epithet for someone so incompetent at a task that no amount of assistance will help them succeed.

The main source of historical information about Liu Shan and his contemporaries is &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. Its author Chen Shou noted in his postface that Zhuge Liang did not employ scribes at Liu Shan&#x27;s court, contrary to tradition. This custom would never be established in Shu Han, so details of Liu Shan&#x27;s rule are hazy in comparison to the richness of information available for Shu&#x27;s rival states of Wei and Wu. Much of his reign is recorded in spare, terse synopsis.

==Early life==
Liu Shan was the eldest son of the warlord Liu Bei and was born to Liu Bei&#x27;s concubine Lady Gan. In 208, Liu Bei&#x27;s rival Cao Cao, who had by then occupied most of northern China, launched a campaign on Jing Province. During his retreat south, Liu Bei was caught up by an elite cavalry force led by Cao Cao at the Battle of Changban, and forced to leave behind Lady Gan and Liu Shan to resume his escape. Liu Bei&#x27;s general Zhao Yun stayed behind to protect the family members of Liu Bei. Holding the infant Liu Shan in his arms, Zhao Yun led the mother and child to safety.

An alternative story of Liu Shan&#x27;s early life was given in Yu Huan&#x27;s &quot;Weilüe&quot;. It was said that Liu Shan, then already several years old, was separated from Liu Bei when the latter was attacked by Cao Cao in Xiaopei in 200. He somehow landed in Hanzhong and was sold by slave traders. Only when Liu Bei declared himself emperor in 221 was Liu Shan reunited with his father. Pei Songzhi included this account in his &quot;Annotated Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; but refused to give it any credence.

After Liu Bei declared himself emperor of Shu Han in 221, Liu Shan was formally made the crown prince. In the following year, Liu Bei left the capital Chengdu on a campaign against Sun Quan, who had sent his general Lü Meng to invade and seize Jing Province from Liu Bei in 219. Liu Bei was defeated at the Battle of Xiaoting and, having retreated to the city of Baidicheng, eventually died in 223. Before his death, Liu Bei entrusted the young Liu Shan to the care of his chancellor Zhuge Liang. Liu Bei made an ambiguous deathbed statement to Zhuge Liang about the possibility of Liu Shan&#x27;s fitness to rule. The statement meant at minimum that Zhuge Liang was empowered to replace Liu Shan if the crown prince proved incapable, and may have indicated permission for Zhuge Liang to take the throne himself.

==Reign==

===Zhuge Liang&#x27;s regency===
While Zhuge Liang was alive, Liu Shan treated him as a father figure, allowing Zhuge to handle all state affairs. Zhuge Liang recommended many trusted officials, including Fei Yi, Dong Yun, Guo Youzhi and Xiang Chong into key positions. Under Zhuge Liang&#x27;s advice, Liu Shan entered into an alliance with the state of Eastern Wu, helping both states to survive against the much larger state of Cao Wei. During Zhuge Liang&#x27;s regency, the government was largely efficient and not corrupt, allowing the relatively small state of Shu to prepare itself for military campaigns.

In 223, Liu Shan married Zhang Fei&#x27;s daughter, Empress Zhang.

In the aftermath of Liu Bei&#x27;s death, the southern Nanman tribes had peeled away from Shu dominion. In 225, Zhuge Liang headed south and was able to, by both military victories and persuasion, reintegrate the southern region into the empire. For the rest of Zhuge Liang&#x27;s regency, the southern Nanman people would be key contributors to Shu&#x27;s campaigns against Wei.

Starting in 227, Zhuge Liang launched his five Northern Expeditions against Wei. All but one were modest military failures, with the Shu forces exhausting their provisions before they were able to inflict significant damage on Wei. On one expedition in 231, Zhuge Liang faced a political crisis. Unable to supply the troops sufficiently, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s co-regent Li Yan forged an edict by Liu Shan, ordering Zhuge Liang to retreat. When Zhuge Liang discovered this, he recommended that Li Yan be removed from his office and put under house arrest, and Liu Shan accepted the recommendation.

In 234, while Zhuge Liang was on his final campaign against Wei, he grew seriously ill. Hearing about Zhuge&#x27;s illness, Liu Shan sent his secretary Li Fu () to the front line to visit Zhuge Liang and request instructions on important state matters. Among other things, Zhuge Liang recommended that Jiang Wan succeed him, and that Fei Yi succeed Jiang Wan. Zhuge Liang refused to answer Li Fu&#x27;s next question — who should succeed Fei Yi. Zhuge Liang died soon thereafter. Liu Shan followed these recommendations, installing Jiang Wan as the new regent.

===Jiang Wan&#x27;s regency===
 From that point on, Shu was generally in a defensive posture and no longer posed a threat to Wei. According to histories of the Wu court, Shu&#x27;s defensive posture was interpreted by many Wu officials as a sign that Shu was abandoning the alliance and had entered into a treaty with Wei; but Wu&#x27;s emperor Sun Quan correctly identified it as merely a sign of weakness, not an abandonment of the alliance.

In 237, Empress Zhang died. That year, Liu Shan took her younger sister as a consort, and in 238 created her empress. Her title remained the same as her sister, Empress Zhang.

In 243, Jiang Wan grew ill and transferred most of his authority to Fei Yi and Fei&#x27;s assistant Dong Yun. In 244, when Wei&#x27;s regent Cao Shuang attacked Hanzhong, it was Fei Yi who led the troops against Cao Shuang and dealt Wei a major defeat in the Battle of Xingshi. Jiang Wan, however, remained influential until his death in 245. Soon after Jiang Wan&#x27;s death, Dong Yun also died — allowing the eunuch Huang Hao, a favourite of Liu Shan&#x27;s, whose power Dong Yun had curbed, to start aggrandising his power. Huang Hao was viewed as corrupt and highly manipulative in domestic matters, and the governmental efficiency that was achieved during Zhuge Liang&#x27;s and Jiang Wan&#x27;s regencies began to deteriorate.

===Fei Yi&#x27;s regency===
After Jiang Wan and Dong Yun&#x27;s deaths, Liu Shan named Jiang Wei as Fei Yi&#x27;s assistant, but both were largely involved only in military matters, as Liu Shan gradually became more self-assertive in non-military matters. It was also around this time that he became more interested in touring the countryside and increasing the use of luxury items, both of which added stress on the treasury, albeit not cripplingly so. Jiang Wei was interested in resuming Zhuge Liang&#x27;s policies of attacking Wei aggressively, a strategy that Fei Yi partially agreed with — as he allowed Jiang Wei to make raids on Wei&#x27;s borders, but never gave him a large number of troops, reasoning that Shu was in no position for a major military confrontation with Wei.

In 253, Fei Yi was assassinated by the general Guo Xun (), a former Wei general who had been forced to surrender but who secretly maintained his loyalty to Wei. Fei Yi&#x27;s death left Jiang Wei as the &quot;de facto&quot; regent, but with a power vacuum in domestic affairs, as Jiang Wei continued to be on the borders, conducting campaigns against Wei. Huang Hao&#x27;s influence increased greatly as a result.

===Jiang Wei&#x27;s semi-regency===
After Fei Yi&#x27;s death, Jiang Wei assumed command of Shu&#x27;s troops and began a number of campaigns against Wei—but while they were troubling to the Wei regents Sima Shi and Sima Zhao, the attacks largely inflicted no real damage against Wei, as Jiang Wei&#x27;s campaigns were plagued by one problem that had plagued Zhuge Liang&#x27;s—the lack of adequate food supply—and largely had to be terminated after a short duration. These campaigns instead had a detrimental effect on Shu, whose government no longer had the efficiency that it had during Zhuge Liang&#x27;s and Jiang Wan&#x27;s regencies, and therefore was unable to cope with the drain of resources that Jiang Wei&#x27;s campaigns were having.

In 253, Jiang Wei made a coordinated attack on Wei, along with Wu&#x27;s regent Zhuge Ke, but was eventually forced to withdraw after his troops ran out of food supplies — allowing Sima Shi to concentrate against Zhuge Ke, dealing Wu forces a devastating defeat that eventually caused so much resentment that Zhuge Ke was assassinated. This was the last of the coordinated attacks by Shu and Wu on Wei in the duration of the Shu-Wu alliance.

In 255, on one of Jiang Wei&#x27;s campaigns, he dealt Wei forces a major defeat in the Battle of Didao, nearly capturing the important Wei border city Didao, but in 256, as he tried to again confront the Wei forces, he was instead dealt a defeat by Deng Ai, and this was a fairly devastating loss that left Jiang Wei with a weakened standing with the people. Many officials now openly questioned Jiang Wei&#x27;s strategy, but Liu Shan took no actions to stop Jiang. Further, in 259, under Jiang Wei&#x27;s suggestion, Liu Shan approved a plan where the main troops were withdrawn from major border cities to try to induce a Wei attack, with troops positioned in such a way as to trap the Wei troops should they do so — a strategy that would be used several years later, in 263, when Wei did attack, but which would prove to be a failure.

By 261, Huang Hao&#x27;s power appeared paramount. Among the key domestic officials, only Dong Jue and Zhuge Liang&#x27;s son Zhuge Zhan were able to maintain their posts without flattering Huang Hao. In 262, Huang Hao would in fact try to remove Jiang Wei and replace him with his friend Yan Yu (). Upon hearing this, Jiang Wei advised Liu Shan to execute Huang Hao, but the emperor denied the request, saying that the eunuch was but a servant who ran errands. Fearing retaliation, Jiang Wei left Chengdu to garrison troops at Tazhong (; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu).

According to the Wu ambassador Xue Xu, who visited Shu in 261 on the order of the Wu emperor Sun Xiu, the status that Shu was in at this point was:

:The ruler is incompetent and does not know his errors; his subordinates do the bare minimum to avoid punishment. When I entered their court, I heard no proper speech; when I toured their countryside, the people looked sallow from hunger. Your servant has heard that swallows and sparrows may nests atop a great hall, mother and child both content, believing themselves safe. Yet should the rafters suddenly ignite, the birds remain happy, unaware of the disaster about to befall them. The situation is analogous.

===Fall of Shu===
In 262, aggravated by Jiang Wei&#x27;s constant attacks, Wei&#x27;s regent Sima Zhao planned to carry out a major campaign to terminate the Shu threat once and for all. Upon hearing rumours of this plan, Jiang Wei submitted a request to Liu Shan, warning him about the mustering of Wei troops under the generals Deng Ai, Zhuge Xu, and Zhong Hui near the border. However, Huang Hao persuaded Liu Shan with fortunetelling to take no action on Jiang Wei&#x27;s requests for war preparations.

In 263, Sima Zhao launched his attacks, led by Deng Ai, Zhuge Xu, and Zhong Hui. Liu Shan followed Jiang Wei&#x27;s previous plans and ordered the border troops to withdraw and prepare to trap Wei forces, rather than to confront them directly. The plan, however, had a fatal flaw — it assumed that Wei forces would siege the border cities, which, instead, Deng Ai and Zhong Hui ignored, and they advanced instead on Yang&#x27;an Pass (陽安關; in present-day Hanzhong, Shaanxi), capturing it. Jiang Wei was able to meet their troops and initially repel them, but Deng Ai led his army through a treacherous mountain pass and deep into Shu territory. There he launched a surprise attack on Jiangyou (江油; in present-day Mianyang, Sichuan). After defeating Zhuge Zhan there, Deng Ai had virtually no Shu troops left between his army and the Shu capital Chengdu. Faced with the prospect of defending Chengdu against Deng Ai&#x27;s troops with no defences, Liu Shan took the advice of Secretary Qiao Zhou and promptly surrendered. This surrender was criticised by many: Chen Shou alone had sympathetic words, in a laconic coda to the biography of Qiao Zhou, his own former mentor. It would be until the Qing dynasty that other nuanced or positive assessments were made.

In March 264, Zhong Hui would carry out an attempt to seize power — which Jiang Wei, who had surrendered to Zhong Hui, tried to take advantage of to revive Shu. He advised Zhong Hui to falsely accuse Deng Ai of treason and arrest him, and, with their combined troops, rebel against Sima Zhao. Zhong Hui did so, and Jiang Wei planned to next kill Zhong Hui and his followers, and then redeclare Shu&#x27;s independence under emperor Liu Shan, and had in fact written to Liu Shan to inform him of those plans. However, Zhong Hui&#x27;s troops rebelled against him, and both Jiang Wei and Zhong Hui were killed in battle. Liu Shan himself was not harmed in the disturbance, although his crown prince Liu Xuan was killed in the confusion.

==Life after the fall of Shu==
In early 264, Liu Shan with Empress Zhang and his entire family was relocated to the Wei capital Luoyang. On 11 April 264, he was enfeoffed as Duke of Anle () while his sons and grandsons became marquises. This practice was referred to as (). 

The by Xi Zuochi records an incident which has become the most famous tale to be associated with Liu Shan: One day, the Wei regent Sima Zhao invited Liu Shan and his followers to a feast, during which Sima Zhao arranged to have entertainers perform traditional Shu music and dance. The former Shu officials present were all saddened, but Liu Shan was visibly unmoved. When asked by Sima Zhao if he missed his former state, Liu Shan replied:
This phrase has become a Chinese idiom— &quot;lèbùsīshǔ&quot; (), figuratively meaning &quot;joyful and does not think of home / the past&quot;. The phrase has a negative connotation with regards to the person&#x27;s character.

Former Shu official Xi Zheng then advised Liu Shan that the appropriate response was to lament how far he had been removed from his family tombs. Liu Shan followed the advice when he was asked the same question later, however Sima Zhao quickly guessed that he had been coached in his answer, and Liu Shan admitted as much. This was noted by Sima Zhao as a sign that Liu Shan was an incompetent fool; some later historians believed that it showed Liu Shan&#x27;s wisdom in intentionally displaying a lack of ambition so that Sima Zhao would not view him as a threat.

Liu Shan died in 271 in Luoyang, and was given the posthumous name &quot;Duke Si of Anle&quot; (; &quot;the deep-thinking duke of peace and happiness&quot;). This landless sinecure lasted a few generations during Wei&#x27;s successor state, the Jin dynasty, before being extinguished in the Disaster of Yongjia. Liu Yuan, the founder of Han-Zhao, one of the states in the Sixteen Kingdoms, claimed to be a legitimate successor of the Han dynasty. In that capacity, he bestowed Liu Shan the posthumous name &quot;Emperor Xiaohuai&quot; (; &quot;the filial and kind emperor&quot;).

==Assessment==
===Contemporary===
Liu Shan had a very negative reputation among his contemporaries. He was seen as an incompetent ruler, more interested in satisfying his desires than looking after his country and was held responsible for appointing corrupt officials to position of power.

Both Xue Xu and Lu Kai, officials from the allied State of Eastern Wu described him as a mediocre ruler with Xue Xu further remarking that when he travelled to Shu for his mission as emissary in 261, he saw corruption among the officials and hunger among the people. Lu Kai noted that the natural defences of Sichuan along with a strong army were enough to protect his State yet Liu Shan allowed disorder and corruption in his court, failed to recognize honest officials from dishonest more interested in luxury which is how his State and subordinates became prisoners from another.

This statement about the impressive natural defenses of the region is repeated by Li Te, when he led his clan back to Yi Province. While passing through Jian&#x27;ge Pass (劍閣關, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan), he exclaimed that with such an impressive barrier, only a lesser man like Liu Shan could have been submitted by someone else.

As previously stated, Sima Zhao thought of Liu Shan&#x27;s attitude as pleasure seeker, saying that even someone as talented as Zhuge Liang couldn&#x27;t assist and safeguard him forever so even less Jiang Wei. Jia Chong answered to Sima Zhao that this was the same behaviour that allowed them to conquer Shu Han. A resounding anecdote when comparing with the events preceding the Wei invasion. When he was Emperor, Liu Shan repeatedly wanted to expand his harem however Dong Yun prevented him from doing so. Liu Shan was too afraid to act against him and for this disliked him. After Dong Yun&#x27;s death, with the flattery of Chen Zhi and influence of Huang Hao, Liu Shan&#x27;s hatred for Dong Yun grew each day. After Chen Zhi&#x27;s death in 258, Huang Hao was controlling the politics of the State and none among the people of Shu did not miss Dong Yun.

Li Mi, a former official of Shu gave a mixed appraisal praising him for the employment of Zhuge Liang which allowed him to stabilize his power but also criticizing him for the employment of Huang Hao which allowed the later corruption of his court. Sun Sheng evaluated Liu Shan as a mediocre and ignorant ruler and denounced him for surrendering so quickly during the Conquest of Shu by Wei in 263 rather than use the local rugged terrain along with other armies in his government to resist the invaders. Pei Songzhi qualified him (along with Fei Yi) as an average individual who had no weight on the existence of his State.

Chang Qu, who wrote extensively about the history of the Sichuan region in the &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot; (&quot;Huayang Guo Zhi&quot;), greatly praised Zhuge Liang but lamented that his lord, Liu Shan wasn&#x27;t the kind of man that could unite a country. In the volume 7 of the &quot;Huayang Guo Zhi&quot;, he ends Liu Shan&#x27;s biography with Wang Chong&#x27;s eulogy toward his former State of Shu Han where Wang Chong comments that Liu Shan was a mediocre ruler without ambition toward the world and was in part responsible for the decline of his State.

Chen Shou, who wrote Liu Shan&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;), in his appraisal commends Liu Shan when he appointed Zhuge Liang for following reason but condemns him for the employment of Huang Hao as being ignorant. He noted that when something is without substance, it reflects what&#x27;s around. And this expression fits Liu Shan perfectly.

===Modern===
However, modern historians have taken a revisionist view, challenging the common portrayal of Liu Shan seeing him in a far more positive light.

Among them, Yi Zhongtian argued that even competent emperors like Emperor Wu of Han had evil courtiers beside him; Liu Shan is not the only case. Moreover, surrounding Liu Shan were not only evil courtiers, but also many competent and talented officers like Jiang Wan, Fei Yi and Dong Yun. Secondly, Liu Shan surrendering without much fighting is blameworthy, but the fall of Shu Han was actually due to many reasons. Thirdly, for the case of Zhao Yun, Zhao&#x27;s official position during his life was actually lower than Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Ma Chao and Huang Zhong. Hence, Liu Shan&#x27;s awarding of posthumous Marquis titles to the latter four but not timely to Zhao Yun was understandable. Finally, Liu Shan&#x27;s behavior in front of Sima Zhao was purposeful: he pretended to be stupid and despicable so that Sima Zhao would ignore him and spare his family, and Liu Shan was successful. Being able to fool the distrustful Sima Zhao meant Liu Shan was actually not a fool.

Moreover, there were notable signs of Liu Shan&#x27;s competence during his reign. He cleverly retook direct control of state affairs after the death of Zhuge Liang and appointed Jiang Wan and Fei Yi so that the two could keep each other in check. In 238, Cao Wei made war with Gongsun Yuan and many people in Shu Han believed it was a good chance for northern expansion. However, Liu Shan carefully instructed Fei Yi to attack only in combination with Eastern Wu, and only when Cao Wei was unprepared. Several historical commentators thus compare Liu Shan&#x27;s caution favorably with that of Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang&#x27;s costly and ineffective campaigns. Finally, Liu Shan&#x27;s surrender in 262-263 has been viewed with sympathy as an inevitable choice by commentators in both historical records and contemporary times, due to the vast difference in population and military capability between the two states, as well as the tendency of victors to massacre the citizens of enemy states that had refused to surrender. In particular, Liu Shan&#x27;s surrender is often compared favorably with that of Gongsun Yuan, a regional warlord who attempted to retake power by allying with Eastern Wu, which eventually resulted in the extermination of his clan, and a bloody massacre of his population base at Liaodong. In contrast, Liu Shan&#x27;s surrender led to a peaceful transfer of power to the Wei kingdom, with most of the population unharmed, except during the week of unrest caused by Jiang Wei&#x27;s plotting.

<doc id="481548" wikidata="Q320699" url="?curid=481548" title="Coat of arms of Ivory Coast">
<text>The coat of arms of Ivory Coast in its current form was adopted in 1964. The focal point of the emblem is the head of a forest elephant, which is symbolically important to the nation, since it is the largest animal found in Ivory Coast as well as being the source of ivory for which the nation is named. The rising sun is a traditional symbol of a new beginning. Below the elephant head is a banner containing the name of the nation.

== Official 1964 decree ==
The decree n° 64-237 of 26 June 1964, modifying the decree n° 60-78 of 8 February 1960 establishing the coat of arms of the Republic of Ivory Coast, defines in its second article the coat of arms as follows : &quot;On an escutcheon Vert an elephant&#x27;s head, the shield surmounted by an issuant eclipsed sun Or radiating of nine part Or. At dexter and sinister two trees Or and the Argent inscription « &quot;République de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot; » on Or strip.&quot;.

Therefore, this decree states that the coat of arms of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire is composed of six elements:
* The elephant&#x27;s head;
* The golden rising sun;
* The two golden palm trees;
* The green escutcheon (at the creation of the coat of arms of February 8, 1960, the escutcheon was Azure);
* The golden strip;
* The Argent &quot;République de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot; inscription on the strip.

The Coat of arms of the Republic act :
* As a means of identification for the Republic and its institutions. For this purpose, it must be placed on all official documents in the middle top or in the upper right corner, as a stamp;
* As a means of education, a call for unity and solidarity against all adversity. Historically, the designers of the coat of arms were inspired by natural elements symbolizing the main political parties during the colonial period, the elephant representing the PDCI and the trees the former progressive party.

== Evolutions from 1960 to today ==
The coat of arms of the Republic of Ivory Coast has evolved between 1960 and today. As defined by governmental decree, only the arms of 1964 should be used, except in the context of a non-official historical subject. The use of arms other than those of 1964, reaffirmed in 2011 and still in force, is considered incorrect.

He spent two years in Europe at the University of Heidelberg and what is now the University of Burgundy before returning to the University of Virginia to receive his law degree in 1876. After a brief return to Memphis (where he married Elizabeth Dial Webb in 1877), Williams returned to Yazoo County, where from 1878 to 1893 he ran the family plantation and kept a law practice.

==Political career==
Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1893, Williams soon became a leader of the Democratic minority, renowned for his speaking skill and wit. Like most other Southern Democrats of the day, he was a proponent of coining silver and an opponent of high tariffs. In 1906, when Great Britain launched HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, Williams flippantly proposed that the name of an American battleship being built in response at the urging of Theodore Roosevelt be changed from &quot;Michigan&quot; to &quot;Skeered o&#x27; Nothin&quot;&#x27; and that the ship&#x27;s first mission be to challenge &quot;Dreadnought&quot; to a duel off the coast of Long Island, Roosevelt&#x27;s home, with Roosevelt and most of his cabinet on deck.

During his time as ranking Democrat in the Republican-controlled House, Williams was given the privilege of choosing the Democrats assigned to committees by the House Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon (by the rules of the House, Cannon was entitled to make all appointments himself), giving him tremendous power within the minority party. In gratitude, Williams was known to omit Democrats whom Cannon found particularly objectionable from committee assignments. Recognizing his status vis-à-vis Cannon, Williams jokingly described his relative political impotence in the Cannon-dominated Committee on Rules, &quot;I am invited to the seances but I am never consulted about the spiritualistic appearances.&quot;

By beating one of Mississippi&#x27;s leading racebaiters, James K. Vardaman, Williams moved to the United States Senate in 1911 after an early election on 21 January 1908. He became one of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s strongest supporters, from Wilson&#x27;s nomination for the Presidency in 1912 to the losing battle to ratify American participation in the League of Nations in 1920. During his time as a senator, he also served as a chairman of the Committee to Establish a University of the United States.

He made a notorious denunciation of the black race when he declared on December 20, 1898: &quot;You could ship-wreck 10,000 illiterate white Americans on a desert island, and in three weeks they would have a fairly good government, conceived and administered upon fairly democratic lines. You could ship-wreck 10,000 negroes, every one of whom was a graduate of Harvard University, and in less than three years, they would have retrograded governmentally; half of the men would have been killed, and the other half would have two wives apiece.&quot;

After retiring from the Senate in 1923, Williams returned to his family plantation, where he spent the last decade of his life, dying in late 1932.

<text>Melvin Mermelstein (born Moric Mermelstein; September 25, 1926 – January 28, 2022) was a Czechoslovak-born American Holocaust survivor and autobiographer. A Jew, he was the sole survivor of his family&#x27;s extermination at Auschwitz concentration camp. 

He is best known for his litigation with the Institute for Historical Review over evidence of gas chambers in German concentration camps during World War II. The legal dispute was resolved in Mermelstein&#x27;s favor, without the court giving an opinion on the merits of the dispute, since it ruled that the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz is a legally indisputable fact.

==Life and career==

Mermelstein was born in Örösveg, the son of Fani, a homemaker, and Herman-Bernad Mermelstein, a winemaker. Before World War II broke out, Mermelstein lived in Munkacs, then part of Czechoslovakia (occupied by Hungary in 1938). On May 19, 1944, he was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Mermelstein spent a little less than one year at Auschwitz, then in January 1945 he was sent on a death march with 3,200 other prisoners to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp. From there he was sent on a train without food or water to Buchenwald concentration camp, where he arrived suffering with typhus and weighing only 68 pounds. He spent two months at Buchenwald until he was liberated by U.S. troops on April 11, 1945. His parents, two sisters, and a brother were murdered in the camps. Before his father&#x27;s death, Mermelstein had promised his father he would tell everyone what the Nazis were doing.

===The Institute for Historical Review===
In 1980, the Institute for Historical Review (IHR) promised a $50,000 reward to anyone who could prove that Jews were gassed at Auschwitz.

Mermelstein wrote a letter to the editors of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and others, including &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;. The Institute for Historical Review wrote back, offering him $50,000 for proof that Jews were, in fact, gassed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. Mermelstein, in turn, submitted a notarized account of his internment at Auschwitz and how in 1944 he witnessed Nazi guards ushering his mother and two sisters and others towards (as he learned later) gas chamber number five. 
The IHR refused to pay the reward, stating that Mermelstein&#x27;s notarized account was &quot;not sufficient proof&quot;. Represented by public interest attorney William John Cox, Mermelstein subsequently sued the IHR in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County for breach of contract, anticipatory repudiation, libel, injurious denial of established fact, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and declaratory relief (see case no. C 356 542). On October 9, 1981, both parties in the Mermelstein case filed motions for summary judgment in consideration of which Judge Thomas T. Johnson of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County took &quot;judicial notice of the fact that Jews were gassed to death at the Auschwitz Concentration Camp in Poland during the summer of 1944&quot;, judicial notice meaning that the court treated the gas chambers as common knowledge, and therefore did not require evidence that the gas chambers existed. On August 5, 1985, Judge Robert A. Wenke entered a judgment based upon the Stipulation for Entry of Judgment agreed upon by the parties on July 22, 1985. The judgment required IHR and other defendants to pay $90,000 to Mermelstein and to issue a letter of apology to &quot;Mr. Mel Mermelstein, a survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau and Buchenwald, and all other survivors of Auschwitz&quot; for &quot;pain, anguish and suffering&quot; caused to them.

In a pre-trial determination, Judge Thomas T. Johnson declared:

In California, the &quot;Evidence Code&quot; permits the Court to take judicial notice of &quot;facts and propositions of generalized knowledge that are so universally known that they cannot reasonably be the subject of dispute&quot;.

In 1986, the IHR, along with its founder Willis Carto, sued Mermelstein for allegedly libeling them during an interview with a New York City radio station, but dropped the lawsuit in 1988. Mermelstein also sued the IHR in 1988 for an article in the &quot;IHR Newsletter&quot; that examined what it considered to be flaws and inconsistencies in his 1981 lawsuit testimony.

In 1988, Mermelstein (who was a member of the International Auschwitz Committee) included photo-enlarged copies of IHR&#x27;s checks to him totaling $90,000 along with their apology letter in the exhibit &quot;From Ashes to Life&quot; at the Mills House Art Gallery in Garden Grove, California. The exhibit also included other Holocaust documentation from Mermelstein&#x27;s collection, including photos of his family and of other emaciated camp victims and survivors.

Mermelstein was portrayed by Leonard Nimoy and Cox was played by Dabney Coleman in a 1991 TV film, &quot;Never Forget&quot;, about the 1981 lawsuit. He wrote of the court battle in his autobiography, titled &quot;By Bread Alone&quot;.

==Death==
Mermelstein died from complications of COVID-19 at home in Long Beach, California, on January 28, 2022. He was 95.

<doc id="481560" wikidata="Q242912" url="?curid=481560" title="Coat of arms of Cuba">
<text>The Cuban coat of arms is the official heraldic symbol of Cuba. It consists of a shield, in front of a fasces crowned by the Phrygian cap, all supported by an oak branch on one side and a laurel wreath on the other. The coat of arms was created by Miguel Teurbe Tolón in 1849. The current version is not exactly the same as the original, since some elements related to annexationist ideas were removed. The design specifications of the shield were established by decree by the first president of Cuba, Tomás Estrada Palma, on 21 April 1906.

This emblem is currently the only communist state not to feature socialist heraldry. 

==Official description==
Cuban law describes the coat of arms as follows:

&quot;The coat of arms is a symbol of the nation that is formed by two arches of equal circles, cut turning concavities to each other, as in an ogival shield. It&#x27;s split at two thirds of its height, where a horizontal line divides it. It consists of three spaces or fields: the top represents a sea, on its sides, right and left, opposite to each other, two capes or points of land, between which, closing the strait they form, extending from left to right, a key with a thick stem, its ward down, and for its background a rising sun with its rays extending throughout the sky of the landscape. In the lower space or field to its left lie five bends, placed alternately, of the same width, of the colors dark blue and white, blue one being the highest, and all slighted from left to right. In the lower space or field to its right, the figure of a landscape representing a valley, in its center rises a royal palm tree, with the bud of its middle leaf being the highest, standing upright, for its background two mountains and clear skies. The shield is supported by a bundle of sticks, its lower end tied with a red string crossed in saltire, protruding from below the point of the shield. Above, protruding from the central part of the shield, is located a bundle of sticks tied together by a red circular string. The crown of the bundle of sticks is covered by a Phrygian cap of the red color turned right, and is sustained on one of the sticks slightly protruding. In the central part of the cap is a white five-pointed star, one of the points up. Not surpassing the rightmost and leftmost points of the arches of the shield, two branches, with their respective fruit, bordering it, one of laurel to the right, and one of holly oak to the left, facing it and crossed in the lower end of the shield, behind the bundle of sticks.&quot;

<text>U.S. Route 52 (US 52) is a major U.S. Highway in the Central United States that extends from the northern to southeastern region of the United States. Contrary to most other even-numbered U.S. Highways, US 52 primarily follows a northwest–southeast route, and it is signed north–south or east–west depending on the local orientation of the route. The highway&#x27;s northwestern terminus is in Portal, North Dakota, at the Canadian border, where it continues as Saskatchewan Highway 39. Its southeastern terminus is in Charleston, South Carolina, at Number 2 Meeting Street and White Point Garden along the Charleston Harbor.

=== North Dakota ===

In North Dakota, US 52 continues from Highway 39 from the Canadian border at North Portal, Saskatchewan, and Portal, North Dakota, to the Red River in Fargo, a distance of . US 52 is co-signed with US 2 near Minot, where it also intersects with US 83. US 52 is also co-signed with US 281 for between Jamestown and Carrington. US 52 is concurrent with Interstate 94 (I-94) between Jamestown and the Minnesota state line, co-signed between Jamestown and Fargo; however, all of the interchanges for the Fargo–West Fargo portion of the route are unsigned.

=== Minnesota ===
In the state of Minnesota, US 52 enters the state with I-94 at Moorhead and follows I-94 southeasterly all the way to the Twin Cities. The portion of the highway which overlaps I-94 is unsigned. From Downtown St. Paul, US 52 continues on its own southeast over the Lafayette Bridge in St. Paul, continuing as an expressway to Rochester and the Iowa state line. The Minnesota Department of Transportation has a long-term goal of making US 52 a freeway with limited-access interchanges between St. Paul and I-90 south of Rochester. South from I-94 in St. Paul there is a freeway segment to just south of Concord Boulevard in Inver Grove Heights. The portion of the highway between Inver Grove Heights and Pine Island is built to expressway standards. Another freeway segment begins from Pine Island, through Rochester reaching its largest single capacity in Minnesota through Rochester as a six- to eight-lane freeway, toward I-90 where it converts to a rural two-lane highway. The highway then proceeds to the Iowa state line.

=== Iowa ===

US 52 enters Iowa north of the unincorporated community of Burr Oak. It passes by Luther College on the west side of Decorah. At Calmar the road turns to a southwest–northeast orientation. It joins with US 18 just to the west of Postville. The two highways overlap until a point east of the unincorporated community of Froelich. US 52 roughly parallels the Mississippi River for the rest of its path through Iowa to Dyersville, where it intersects and joins US 20 and turns eastward towards Dubuque.
West of Dubuque, US 52 merges south onto the Southwest Arterial, a four-lane expressway directing traffic around the southern edge of the city. US 52 heads southeast to a junction with US 61 and US 151. All three routes travel northbound (even US 52, which is signed as southbound) as an expressway, until US 52 departs in Key West to remain close to the Mississippi River. After passing through a hilly and scenic region, including the small river city of Bellevue, the highway turns to an east–west orientation near Sabula at the junction of Iowa 64 and the northern terminus of US 67. In Sabula, the highway becomes a wrong-way road; northbound traffic travels south, and vice versa, from Sabula to the Dale Gardner Veterans Memorial Bridge, where US 52 crosses over the Mississippi River into Illinois.

North of Dubuque, US 52 was formerly routed onto a narrow and winding road, concurrently with Iowa 3. While scenic, the road has been the scene of numerous accidents over the years owing to this nature. Between 1964 and 1967, this segment of the route was designated Alternate US 52 and US 52 was rerouted south from Luxemburg to Dyersville along Iowa Highway 136, and east from Dyersville to Dubuque along US 20; however in 1967, US 52 was restored to the Iowa Highway 3 alignment. After the completion of the Southwest Arterial in 2020, a similar change took place as US 52 was once again removed from the Iowa Highway 3 alignment and again routed from Luxemburg to Dyersville to Dubuque, then onto the Southwest Arterial, to US 61/US 151, finally reaching its former routing at Key West.

The majority of US 52 in Iowa is located within the unglaciated Driftless Area.

=== Illinois ===
In Illinois, US 52 runs southeast from the Dale Gardner Veterans Memorial Bridge at the terminus of Iowa Highway 64 and Illinois Route 64 in Savanna, passing through the cities of Dixon, Amboy and Mendota. US 52 then turns due south and then east, crossing I-39 near Troy Grove. It continues east, passing through Shorewood and then through the southern portion of Joliet, where it is a major thoroughfare in the city of Joliet (Jefferson Street), avoiding the city of Chicago proper. It joins with US 45 through Kankakee, thereafter running concurrently with US 24, east of Watseka to the Indiana state line.

=== Indiana ===
In Indiana, US 52 runs in a northwest–southeast direction. It passes through Lafayette where it used to be on Sagamore Parkway, but was later rerouted onto the US 231 bypass and Teal Road. Northwest of Indianapolis, US 52 runs along the same general area as, and is considered an alternative route to, I-65. In the Indianapolis area, it is overlapped with I-865, I-465, and I-69. East of Indianapolis, it is considered an alternative to I-74 before joining it near the Ohio state line.

When US 52 went through Downtown Indianapolis, it went onto Brookville Road, then turned left onto English Avenue. It then joined US 421 when it turned onto Southeastern Avenue. US 52/US 421 joined US 40 when it turned onto Washington Street. It then split into Washington Street (westbound) and Maryland Street (eastbound). US 52 then turned onto West Street (from West Street, it turned onto Maryland Street). US 52 turned on 16th Street, where it would overlap US 136. It then turned onto Lafayette Road, which became Indianapolis Road when reaching Zionsville. When I-65 was completed through Downtown Indianapolis, US 52 got on I-65 from the Lafayette Road interchange, and traveled on I-65 the rest of the way. In 1970, the route was re-routed onto the south belt of I-465 from Brookville Road to I-65. It was re-routed again on its current route around Indianapolis in either 2000 or 2001.

US 52 enters Ohio concurrently with I-74 in northwestern Hamilton County. US 52 then merges with I-75 from I-74&#x27;s terminus and exits onto Hopple Street in Cincinnati. It runs along Central Parkway and Central Avenue through downtown and then skirts the Cincinnati riverfront along Mehring Way past Paycor Stadium (formerly Paul Brown Stadium), Great American Ball Park, and Heritage Bank Center (formerly U.S. Bank Arena), onto Pete Rose Way and Riverside Drive. From Cincinnati eastward, US 52 generally follows the Ohio River. There is a brief concurrency with I-275 near California, a neighborhood on the far eastern edge of the city of Cincinnati. Towns along its path include New Richmond, Aberdeen, Ripley and Manchester. The section between I-275 and New Richmond was modernized in the 1960s; parts of the old route run parallel to the newer highway. Around Portsmouth and Ironton US 52 has several freeway or expressway sections. In Portsmouth, US 52 intersects with US 23. At Chesapeake, US 52 crosses the Ohio River into Huntington, West Virginia.

The sections of US 52 that follow the Ohio River are known as the Ohio River Scenic Byway, which is part of the National Scenic Byway Project. The section between State Route 125 (SR 125) and SR 73 (near Portsmouth) is also designated as Scenic Scioto Heritage Trail. This portion of US 52, along the Ohio between Cincinnati and Huntington, is the only part where it falls in geographical sequence, south of US 50 and north of US 60.

US 52 passes by the birthplace of President Ulysses S. Grant in Point Pleasant.

=== West Virginia and Kentucky ===

US 52 serves western and southern portions of West Virginia, running from Huntington to Bluefield. The highway is undergoing a major expansion project which began in 2007 and at current funding levels is likely to take many years to finish.

During its run through West Virginia, US 52 twice enters Kentucky briefly, along the Williamson, West Virginia, bypass, in order to prevent the blasting of several hillsides in West Virginia. These stretches were completed in 1996 as part of the Corridor G (US 119) project. The speed limit in West Virginia is , but drops to along the Kentucky portions, as Kentucky law states that any non-freeway (as is US 52) must not have a higher speed limit. In each instance, however, US 52 re-enters West Virginia.

=== Virginia ===

US 52 enters Virginia from West Virginia, and in Virginia closely follows I-77. It enters southwestern Virginia near Bluefield and passes through Wytheville and Hillsville before leaving the state south of Cana.

=== North Carolina ===

US 52 enters North Carolina just northwest of Mount Airy. It passes Pilot Mountain, one of the most distinctive natural features in North Carolina. Through the Piedmont Triad region, US 52 is mostly a controlled-access freeway. The route joins I-85 Business into Lexington and overlaps I-85 around Salisbury. The segment of US 52 from I-40 in Winston-Salem to Lexington has been upgraded to Interstate Highway standards; I-285 is co-signed along this segment. The segment from northern Winston-Salem to just south of Mount Airy is expected to form part of the I-74 corridor through North Carolina.

South of the Triad area, after splitting from I-85 in Salisbury, US 52 is typically a two-lane route linking some of the state&#x27;s smaller cities and towns. Albemarle is the largest municipality along this segment of US 52 to the South Carolina state line.

=== South Carolina ===

US 52 enters South Carolina northeast of Cheraw. From Darlington southward it is a multilane highway and freeway, passing through Florence, Lake City, Kingstree, Moncks Corner and North Charleston before US 52&#x27;s terminus at the intersection of Meeting and Line Streets in Charleston.

== History ==

Historically, US 52 was routed along University Avenue between Minneapolis and St. Paul. In the 1980s and 1990s, the highway was gradually shifted onto its present route along I-94. However, there was a gap in the definition of the highway for a few years until 1995. Since then, it has been routed along the Interstate between the Twin Cities, although as of 2007, there was still a sign on University Avenue entering Hennepin County telling motorists to follow County Highways 36 and 37 to reach US 52—which kept them on University, then on 4th St. for historic westbound US 52. Historic westbound US 52 then crossed the Central Avenue bridge (current Minnesota State Highway 65) and turned onto the current routing of County Highway 81 northwest to Osseo. It then followed the current route of US 169 north to Anoka.

In Rochester, Minnesota, US 52 was recently expanded to six lanes. Long-term plans have US 52 from St. Paul to I-90 becoming a freeway, and some have suggested that when the conversion is complete, the freeway should become a spur route for I-90. Currently, I-90 has no spur routes in Minnesota.

On April 10, 2015, a rockslide dropped a boulder the size of a house onto the westbound lanes of US 52 in Lawrence County just east of the bridge over the Ohio River to Ashland, Kentucky, leading to closures and detours while two days of cleanup took place.

=== U.S. Route 121 (1926) ===
Established in 1926, US 121 traversed from Lexington, North Carolina, to Max Meadows, Virginia, estimated to be . In North Carolina it overlapped with NC 66; in Virginia it was overlapped with SR 15. In 1934, US 52 was extended southeast into Virginia and North Carolina, and replaced all of US 121.

== Future ==

=== Ohio ===
Long-term plans call for I-74 to be expanded eastward along the current US 52 corridor from its current eastern terminus of I-75 in Cincinnati to US 23, which has been proposed to be upgraded to Interstate Highway standards and be signed as I-73 in Portsmouth. Lack of sufficient funding has hindered construction upgrades for both freeways in Ohio.

Over the years, it has evolved into a significant event, drawing thousands of visitors from across Canada and beyond. The festival has hosted various renowned performers and artists throughout its history and has embraced themed celebrations, such as the &quot;Year of the Family&quot; in 1994, which emphasized the importance of family within Ukrainian culture. As a key contributor to Vegreville&#x27;s cultural identity and tourism industry, the Pysanka Festival fosters community pride and unity.

The 51st edition of the Pysanka Festival is set to be held July 5, 6 and 7, 2024.

=== Vegreville Country Fair ===
The Vegreville Agricultural Society holds an annual five day &quot;Country Fair&quot; in August. 

The Fair starts with a parade on Main Street, which includes participation from various associations, businesses, and individuals who display antique vehicles, farm equipment, horses, wagons, and a variety of parade floats. After the parade, the Fair continues with a wide range of activities such as a midway, grandstand shows, chuckwagon and chariot races, a marketplace, and many other events for attendees to partake in.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the fair was extended from previously being a three-day event, to five days. This welcomed 21,006 people who attended the 118th Annual Country Fair in 2021, a significant increase from the previously seen 12,000 people who attended the fair in 2019. The 2022 119th Annual Country Fair welcomed Gord Bamford for a &quot;Special Event Concert&quot; with Dean Brody performing at the 2023 120th edition of the fair.

<doc id="481569" wikidata="Q7382200" url="?curid=481569" title="Russian dressing">
<text>Russian dressing is a piquant American salad dressing consisting of mayonnaise, ketchup, and other ingredients.

Russian dressing is similar to Thousand Island. Some manufactured versions omit the mayonnaise and are clear rather than creamy, more like French or Catalina.

==History==
Russian dressing is mentioned as early as 1900 in U.S. sources. It is also documented in a 1910 catering book as an alternative to vinaigrette for dressing tomatoes or asparagus. A 1913 cookbook has a recipe which is a vinaigrette with paprika and mustard. A mayonnaise-based recipe is documented in 1914. The condiment came to be called &quot;Russian&quot; since the original recipe included caviar, a staple of Russian cuisine. 

Local historians claim that the mayonnaise-based version was invented in Nashua, New Hampshire, by James E. Colburn in the 1910s. A 1927 biographical article calls him &quot;the originator and first producer of that delectable condiment known as Russian salad dressing&quot;. Colburn had been selling &quot;Colburn&#x27;s Mayonnaise salad dressing&quot; at his store since at least 1910.

By 1914, Colburn&#x27;s company was manufacturing it, and distributing it to retailers and hotels. He earned enough from its sale to retire in 1924.

==Preparation==
Typically piquant, it is today characteristically made of a blend of mayonnaise and ketchup complemented with such additional ingredients as horseradish, pimentos, chives, mustard, and spices.

==Uses==
Besides being used as a salad dressing, Russian dressing is used as a spread for Reuben sandwiches.

==Related sauces==
In the United States, Russian dressing has largely been supplanted by Thousand Island dressing, which is sweeter and less spicy than Russian.

Other combinations of mayonnaise and ketchup, but without the spicy ingredients, are known as fry sauce or other names, and typically served with French fries or tostones.

In Australia, sauce made from mayonnaise and ketchup is called Cocktail Sauce and is used to dress prawns/shrimp in the appetiser known as prawn cocktail.

Tartar sauce has the piquant ingredients of Russian dressing, without the ketchup. It is typically served with fried fish.

Marie Rose sauce is similar to Russian dressing, but with different piquant ingredients. It is typically served with seafood.

A variant known as red Russian dressing is very much like Catalina or French dressing.

In Germany, a similar salad dressing is called &quot;American dressing&quot;.

<doc id="481570" wikidata="Q4787910" url="?curid=481570" title="Arden, Barbour County, West Virginia">
<text>Arden is a small unincorporated community located along the Tygart Valley River in Barbour County in the north central portion of the U.S. state of West Virginia.

The Arden settlement was built up along a stretch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad tracks; a narrow-gauge railroad was first laid through this area in the early 1880s. It had its own post office at one time.

The community is known today to whitewater enthusiasts as being situated between two landmark rock formations: Hell&#x27;s Gate and Devil&#x27;s Den. Many such recreationalists shoot the shallow rapids of the river through this pristine section of the Valley with its numerous large boulders and small falls. The area is home to a notable number of native wildflowers and is locally notorious for its occasional drownings. The community contains the famous Party Rock known for its flat formation for people to have parties on, and also known to take many people’s lives from falling off the rock.

==Notable person==
*Ida Lilliard Reed (1865–1951), noted hymnwriter, lived nearby.

<text>Trader Joe&#x27;s is an American grocery store chain headquartered in Monrovia, California, with 597 locations across the US. 

The first Trader Joe&#x27;s store was opened in 1967 by founder Joe Coulombe in Pasadena, California. In 1979, the chain was sold to Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, who owned it until his death in 2010; ownership passed to his heirs. The company operates offices in both Monrovia, California, and Boston, Massachusetts, but remains German-owned.

Trader Joe&#x27;s has been accused of union busting in numerous cases. The company has been party to lawsuits seeking to have the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces U.S. labor law in relation to collective bargaining and unfair labor practices, deemed unconstitutional.

== History ==

Trader Joe&#x27;s is named after its founder, Joe Coulombe. The company began in 1958 as a Greater Los Angeles area chain known as Pronto Market convenience stores. Coulombe believed that the original Pronto Markets were too similar to 7-Eleven, which he described as the &quot;800-pound gorilla of convenience stores&quot;, and was concerned that the competition would be too heavy.

Coulombe developed the idea of the Trader Joe&#x27;s South Seas motif while on vacation in the Caribbean. During the 1960s, the Tiki culture craze was still widespread in the United States, so in a direct nod to the fad, the Trader Joe&#x27;s name itself was a spoof on Trader Vic&#x27;s, the famous tiki-themed restaurant that had opened its first southern California location in the Beverly Hilton in 1955. Dining at Trader Vic&#x27;s in Beverly Hills was notoriously expensive, but the Trader Joe&#x27;s in Pasadena provided an irreverent and more affordable offering of food and drink. Coulombe noted two trends in the US that informed the merchandising of his new store concept: one, the number of college-educated people was rising steadily, partly due to the G.I. Bill, and two, with new jumbo jets due to premiere in 1970, international travel would be accelerating as well. A better educated, more well-traveled public were acquiring tastes they had trouble satisfying in American supermarkets at the time.

The first store branded as &quot;Trader Joe&#x27;s&quot; opened in 1967 in Pasadena, California; it remains in operation. In their first few decades, some of the stores offered fresh meats provided by butchers who leased space in the stores, along with sandwiches and freshly cut cheese, all in-store.

In 1979, owner and CEO of Aldi Nord Theo Albrecht bought the company as a personal investment for his family. Coulombe was succeeded as CEO by John V. Shields in 1987. Under his leadership, the company expanded into Arizona in 1993 and into the Pacific Northwest two years later. In 1996, the company opened its first stores on the East Coast in Brookline and Cambridge, both outside Boston. In 2001, Shields retired and Dan Bane succeeded him as CEO.

Since its inception, Trader Joe&#x27;s has continued to expand across the United States. In 2004, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; reported that Trader Joe&#x27;s quintupled its number of stores between 1990 and 2001 and increased its profits tenfold. In February 2008, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; reported that the company had the highest sales per square foot of any grocer in the United States. Two-and-a-half years later and in 2016, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine estimated sales to be $1,750 in merchandise per square foot, more than double the sales generated by Whole Foods.

Joe Coulombe, the namesake of the brand, died in 2020. Dan Bane retired as the CEO in July 2023 and was succeeded by Bryan Palbaum, previously the company&#x27;s COO and president. At the same time, the company named Jon Basalone as vice-CEO and president, taking over Palbaum in the latter role.

==Locations==

, Trader Joe&#x27;s had 593 stores across 43 states as well as the District of Columbia in the United States with stores being added regularly. Most locations averaged between and . California has the largest number of stores with 193 open in the state. The chain&#x27;s busiest location is its 72nd &amp; Broadway store on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The smallest Trader Joe&#x27;s location is in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts on Boylston St.

Each location is designed to represent its respective area, with staff members creating murals along store walls to represent the surrounding neighborhood. Some store locations have their own &quot;find the mascot&quot;, and children can obtain stickers and lollipops when they tell a staff member where it is &quot;hiding”. Crew members typically hide the mascot in the stores. 

=== Economic exclusivity and gentrification ===
Despite being known as a &quot;neighborhood store&quot; with affordable options, Trader Joe&#x27;s locations are mostly in well-off neighborhoods. In 2022, the typical Trader Joe&#x27;s customer was a married person living in an urban area, between 25 and 44 years old, earning at least $80,000. When deciding where to open locations, the chain typically looks for areas where the median household income is over $100,000.

Conversely, Trader Joe&#x27;s has also faced opposition for contributing to gentrification. Between 1997 and 2014, Zillow found that homes grow more rapidly in value if they are closer to a Trader Joe&#x27;s or Whole Foods, with such homes consistently being worth more than the mean U.S. home. In 2014, Trader Joe&#x27;s agreed to halt plans to open a store in a historically black neighborhood in Portland, Oregon, following protests led by the Portland African American Leadership Forum. The organization objected to the $2.4 million subsidy offered by the city to Trader Joe&#x27;s and emphasized that they were not against Trader Joe&#x27;s but instead were pushing back against the city&#x27;s history of displacing African Americans. In 2015, along with a proposal to build new affordable housing, the city announced that a different store, Natural Grocers, would be built on the vacant lot.

==Products==
=== Private label ===
Trader Joe&#x27;s sells many items under its own private labels, at a significant discount to name-brand equivalents, and requires its name-brand suppliers not to publicize this business relationship. By selling almost all of its products under its own labels, Trader Joe&#x27;s &quot;skips the middle man&quot; and buys directly from both local and international vendors. The company has been criticized for allegedly copying products from vendors after soliciting partnerships and requesting sample products for their private labels.

While a typical grocery store may carry 50,000 items, Trader Joe&#x27;s stocks about 4,000 items, 80% of which bear one of its brand names. Products include gourmet foods, organic foods, vegan and vegetarian foods, frozen foods, imported foods, and domestic and imported wine and beer (where local law permits).

In 1977, the company began introducing international-sounding variants of its brand for some of its private label ethnic food items, such as &quot;Trader José&quot;, &quot;Trader Joe San&quot;, and &quot;Trader Giotto&quot; for Mexican, Japanese, and Italian products respectively. The company also referenced other cultures with branding like &quot;Trader Ming&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Arabian Joe&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Pilgrim Joe&quot; for Chinese, Middle Eastern, and Thanksgiving-themed American products. In July 2020, during the George Floyd protests, an online petition signed by 5,300 people asked the company to rename these products, criticized their labeling as &quot;racist&quot; and accusing the company of promoting &quot;a narrative of exoticism that perpetuates harmful stereotypes&quot;.

The company reacted by stating that it was already in the process of reverting a number of international foods to Trader Joe&#x27;s branding and that this decision had already been made several years earlier. Trader Joe&#x27;s later clarified that some branding referenced in the petition will remain, stating, &quot;We disagree that any of these labels are racist. We do not make decisions based on petitions.&quot; The petition itself has been criticized on social media for promoting cancel culture and for &quot;wasting time on a trivial issue&quot;.

Aldi Nord uses the brand as one of the company&#x27;s private labels in its stores in Europe, predominately for snack foods.

=== Product availability and discontinued products ===
Trader Joe&#x27;s discontinues individual products more often than larger grocery chains. A product may be discontinued because of a variety of reasons: it may be a seasonal product; the cost of producing the item may have increased, thereby also increasing its cost; or the item was not selling strongly enough. New items are introduced every week, so Trader Joe&#x27;s may remove current items to make room for new products on its shelves. In recent years, loyal Trader Joes&#x27;s customers have gained a new obsession with the holiday products. Stores have a hard time keeping their shelves with the holiday products full during these seasons. Stores often have a &quot;new items&quot; case with 10 to 15 products (that can also be found in the rest of the store), indicating an intentional high turnover of products.

Product selection and prices may also differ from state to state. For freshly-prepared items (e.g., deli, bakery, dairy and juice), Trader Joe&#x27;s tries to source products as close to the stores as possible, which may result in variations with recipes and prices. State laws, taxes, deposit requirements, and distribution costs can also influence how products are priced in each location.

In February 2008, Trader Joe&#x27;s announced that it would phase out single-ingredient products from China by April 2008, because of unspecified customer concerns.

=== Cage-free eggs ===
In February 2016, because of customer feedback, Trader Joe&#x27;s announced their goal &quot;to have all the eggs [they] sell in western states (California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado) come from cage-free suppliers by 2020 and all the eggs [they] sell nationally to come from cage-free suppliers by 2025&quot;.
===Wine===
Trader Joe&#x27;s is the exclusive retailer of Charles Shaw wine, popularly known as &quot;Two Buck Chuck&quot; because of its original $1.99 price tag in California (local prices vary). Of the wine selection at Trader Joe&#x27;s, Coulombe said, &quot;We built Trader Joe&#x27;s on wine first, then food. I tasted 100,000 wines, and most weren&#x27;t wonderful. They were submitted to us by desperate vintners&quot;. Upon the death of Fred Franzia of the Charles Shaw label in September 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported Trader Joe&#x27;s had sold over one billion bottles. The company leaves names of wineries off the labels on purpose, although many are from Bronco Wine, the company behind Charles Shaw.

===Most popular items===
The company produces a list of its most popular items each year. The fourteenth year of the survey, results for which were reported in January 2023, showed Chili &amp; Lime Flavored Rolled Tortilla Chips as the top overall product and the favorite snack; the Sparkling Honeycrisp Apple Juice as the favorite beverage; Trader Joe&#x27;s Cheddar Cheese with Caramelized Onions as the favorite cheese; Trader Joe&#x27;s Butter Chicken as the favorite entrée; seasonal candles as the favorite household item; bananas as the favorite produce item; Hold the Cone! Mini Ice Cream Cones as the favorite dessert; and the Cashew &amp; Basil Pesto as the favorite vegan/vegetarian item. Some winners from years past were retired and put into the firm&#x27;s Product Hall of Fame.

== Sustainability ==
Trader Joe&#x27;s states that &quot;a continuing focus of [their] sustainability initiatives is maintaining product integrity and preventing food waste&quot;.

The retailer has been characterized as &quot;notoriously secretive&quot; and it has also been criticized for a lack of transparency by management about the sources of products such as organic milk. Trader Joe&#x27;s scores the lowest on Green America&#x27;s chocolate scorecard, as the retailer shares very little about addressing child labor or deforestation caused by the chocolate it sells.

In 2016, Trader Joe&#x27;s agreed to a settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Justice, due to allegations the company had violated the Clean Air Act by emitting high global warming potential (GWP) and ozone-depleting refrigerants. The company was tasked with reducing its emissions and creating a process to track and repair refrigerants, and was required to use refrigerants with an ultra-low GWP in 15 stores. Since then, the company has not shared its progress to reduce leak rates or publicly report its climate emissions.

=== Improving packaging ===
Trader Joe&#x27;s has been taking steps to make its products more environmentally friendly. In 2019, Greenpeace delivered a petition of 100,000 signatures for Trader Joe&#x27;s to phase out single-use plastics. In response to customer pressure, Trader Joe&#x27;s committed to stop offering single-use carryout bags nationwide, replace its produce bags with biodegradable and compostable options, replace styrofoam trays, and sell more loose, unwrapped produce.

In 2021, as part of an ongoing effort to improve packaging, Trader Joe&#x27;s stated that it had improved over 200 products by eliminating excess components, and increasing the amount of recycled and sustainably sourced materials. The company also removed over 4 million pounds of plastic packaging from their products in 2021. Examples of improvements include removing plastic mesh packaging from produce, converting plastic clamshells for produce to sealed fiber trays, and increasing the number of frozen entrees in a plastic tray with a compostable option.

=== Phasing out unsustainable foods ===
Between 2012 and 2013, Trader Joe&#x27;s moved from 15th on Greenpeace&#x27;s CATO (Carting Away the Oceans) scale to third by removing six unsustainable species of fish from its shelves and getting involved in efforts to protect the Bering Sea Canyons.

=== Eliminating food waste ===
Trader Joe&#x27;s said that in 2021, approximately 99.5% of all products were sold in stores, donated to food recovery partners, or composted. Through its &quot;Neighborhood Shares Program&quot;, Trader Joe&#x27;s donates 100% of the unsold products to local food recovery organizations With that system set in place, the Salem, Oregon store was able to donate all their frozen products during a 31-hour power outage before they went to waste. In 2021, the total volume donated amounted to more than $349 million worth of products to nonprofit partners, and nearly 63 million meals served to local communities, while in 2023, they were able to donate $469 million more worth of products to their communities, representing &quot;104 million pounds of nutritious food&quot;.

==Ratings==
In May 2009, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; ranked Trader Joe&#x27;s the second-best supermarket chain in the United States (after Wegmans). In June 2009, &quot;MSN Money&quot; released its annual Customer Service Hall of Fame survey results, in which Trader Joe&#x27;s ranked second in customer service. From 2008 to 2010, &quot;Ethisphere&quot; magazine listed Trader Joe&#x27;s among its most ethical companies in the United States, but it did not make the list in 2011. In 2014, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; again ranked Trader Joe&#x27;s a top-scoring supermarket chain. The company ranked number 23 among the 2019 Glassdoor best places to work in the US, and number 14 in 2020. 

==Labor relations==
In September 2013, in response to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Trader Joe&#x27;s stated that it would require part-time employees to work an average of 30 hours per week in order to qualify for medical insurance (with free coverage for basic dental and vision care still being available for all crew members who work an average of 15 hours or more per week). Part-time employees who were not qualifying for medical insurance would now be eligible for plans which were available under the ACA (but they would only be made available to those employees whose employers do not offer them an insurance plan). Those employees who were working full-time were unaffected. Maeg Yosef, a union organizer who has worked for 18 years at the Hadley, Massachusetts store, said the company cut contributions to employee retirement plansfrom the equivalent of 15% of an employee&#x27;s annual pay down to nothingsince she started there. Workers at the Trader Joe&#x27;s grocery store in Hadley announced in an open letter dated May 14, 2022, to the company&#x27;s CEO their intent to push for unionization citing stagnated wages and a desire for better pay, benefits and workplace conditions.

Trader Joe&#x27;s has been accused of union busting in numerous cases. The first Trader Joe&#x27;s store to be unionized was in Hadley, Massachusetts in 2022.
On April 20, 2023, crew members at the Trader Joe&#x27;s location in the Rockridge neighborhood of Oakland, California, voted 73–53 to unionize.

In 2024, Trader Joe&#x27;s joined SpaceX in a lawsuit to have the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces U.S. labor law in relation to collective bargaining and unfair labor practices, deemed unconstitutional.

<doc id="481582" wikidata="Q1859242" url="?curid=481582" title="NTRUEncrypt">
<text>The NTRUEncrypt public key cryptosystem, also known as the NTRU encryption algorithm, is an NTRU lattice-based alternative to RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and is based on the shortest vector problem in a lattice (which is not known to be breakable using quantum computers).

It relies on the presumed difficulty of factoring certain polynomials in a truncated polynomial ring into a quotient of two polynomials having very small coefficients. Breaking the cryptosystem is strongly related, though not equivalent, to the algorithmic problem of lattice reduction in certain lattices. Careful choice of parameters is necessary to thwart some published attacks.

Since both encryption and decryption use only simple polynomial multiplication, these operations are very fast compared to other asymmetric encryption schemes, such as RSA, ElGamal and elliptic curve cryptography. However, NTRUEncrypt has not yet undergone a comparable amount of cryptographic analysis in deployed form.

A related algorithm is the NTRUSign digital signature algorithm.

Specifically, NTRU operations are based on objects in a truncated polynomial ring formula_1 with convolution multiplication and all polynomials in the ring have integer coefficients and degree at most &quot;N&quot;-1:

:formula_2

That formula_3 in this ring has the effect that multiplying a polynomial by formula_4 rotates the coefficients of the polynomial. A map of the form formula_5 for a fixed formula_6 thus produces a new polynomial formula_7 where every coefficient depends on as many coefficients from formula_8 as there are nonzero coefficients in formula_9.

NTRU has three integer parameters (&quot;N&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;), where &quot;N&quot; is the polynomial degree bound, &quot;p&quot; is called the small modulus, and &quot;q&quot; is called the large modulus; it is assumed that &quot;N&quot; is prime, &quot;q&quot; is always (much) larger than &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are coprime. Plaintext messages are polynomials modulo &quot;p&quot; but ciphertext messages are polynomials modulo &quot;q&quot;. Concretely the ciphertext consists of the plaintext message plus a randomly chosen multiple of the public key, but the public key may itself be regarded as a multiple of the small modulus &quot;p&quot;, which allows the holder of the private key to extract the plaintext from the ciphertext. 
==History==

The NTRUEncrypt Public Key Cryptosystem is a relatively new cryptosystem.
The first version of the system, which was simply called NTRU, was developed around 1996 by three mathematicians (Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher, and Joseph H. Silverman). In 1996 these mathematicians together with Daniel Lieman founded the NTRU Cryptosystems, Inc. and were given a patent (now expired) on the cryptosystem.

During the last ten years people have been working on improving the cryptosystem. Since the first presentation of the cryptosystem, some changes were made to improve both the performance of the system and its security. Most performance improvements were focused on speeding up the process. Up till 2005 literature can be found that describes the decryption failures of the NTRUEncrypt. As for security, since the first version of the NTRUEncrypt, new parameters have been introduced that seem secure for all currently known attacks and reasonable increase in computation power.

Now the system is fully accepted to IEEE P1363 standards under the specifications for lattice-based public-key cryptography (IEEE P1363.1).
Because of the speed of the NTRUEncrypt Public Key Cryptosystem (see http://bench.cr.yp.to for benchmarking results) and its low memory use (see below), it can be used in applications such as mobile devices and Smart-cards.
In April 2011, NTRUEncrypt was accepted as a X9.98 Standard, for use in the financial services industry.

==Public key generation==

Sending a secret message from Alice to Bob requires the generation of a public and a private key. The public key is known by both Alice and Bob and the private key is only known by Bob. To generate the key pair two polynomials f and g, with degree at most formula_10 and with coefficients in {-1,0,1} are required. They can be considered as representations of the residue classes of polynomials modulo formula_11 in &quot;R&quot;. The polynomial formula_12 must satisfy the additional requirement that the inverses modulo &quot;q&quot; and modulo &quot;p&quot; (computed using the Euclidean algorithm) exist, which means that 
formula_13 and formula_14 must hold.
So when the chosen f is not invertible, Bob has to go back and try another f.

Both f and formula_15 (and formula_16) are Bob&#x27;s private key. The public key h is generated computing the quantity
:formula_17

Example:
In this example the parameters (&quot;N&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) will have the values &quot;N&quot; = 11, &quot;p&quot; = 3 and &quot;q&quot; = 32 and therefore the polynomials f and g are of degree at most 10. The system parameters (&quot;N&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) are known to everybody. The polynomials are randomly chosen, so suppose they are represented by

:formula_18
:formula_19

Using the Euclidean algorithm the inverse of f modulo &quot;p&quot; and modulo &quot;q&quot;, respectively, is computed

:formula_20
:formula_21

Which creates the public key h (known to both Alice and Bob) computing the product

:formula_22

==Encryption==

Alice, who wants to send a secret message to Bob, puts her message in the form of a polynomial m with coefficients in formula_23 . In modern applications of the encryption, the message polynomial can be translated in a binary or ternary representation.
After creating the message polynomial, Alice chooses randomly a polynomial r with small coefficients (not restricted to the set {-1,0,1}), that is meant to obscure the message.

With Bob&#x27;s public key h the encrypted message e is computed:
:formula_24

This ciphertext hides Alice&#x27;s messages and can be sent safely to Bob.

Example:
Assume that Alice wants to send a message that can be written as polynomial
:formula_25 
and that the randomly chosen ‘blinding value’ can be expressed as
:formula_26

The ciphertext e that represents her encrypted message to Bob will look like
:formula_27

==Decryption==
Anybody knowing r could compute the message m by evaluating e - rh; so r must not be revealed by Alice. In addition to the publicly available information, Bob knows his own private key. Here is how he can obtain m: 
First he multiplies the encrypted message e and part of his private key f
:formula_28

By rewriting the polynomials, this equation is actually representing the following computation:

:formula_28
:formula_30
:formula_31
:formula_32

Instead of choosing the coefficients of a between 0 and &quot;q&quot; – 1 they are chosen in the interval [-&quot;q&quot;/2, &quot;q&quot;/2] to prevent that the original message may not be properly recovered since Alice chooses the coordinates of her message m in the interval [-&quot;p&quot;/2, &quot;p&quot;/2]. This implies that all coefficients of formula_33 already lie within the interval [-&quot;q&quot;/2, &quot;q&quot;/2] because the polynomials r, g, f and m and prime &quot;p&quot; all have coefficients that are small compared to &quot;q&quot;. This means that all coefficients are left unchanged during reducing modulo &quot;q&quot; and that the original message may be recovered properly.

The next step will be to calculate a modulo &quot;p&quot;:

:formula_34
because formula_35.

Knowing b Bob can use the other part of his private key formula_36 to recover Alice&#x27;s message by multiplication of b and formula_37

:formula_38
:formula_39

because the property formula_40 was required for formula_37.

Example: 
The encrypted message e from Alice to Bob is multiplied with polynomial f
:formula_42
where Bob uses the interval [-&quot;q&quot;/2, &quot;q&quot;/2] instead of the interval [0, &quot;q&quot; – 1] for the coefficients of polynomial a to prevent that the original message may not be recovered correctly.

Reducing the coefficients of a mod &quot;p&quot; results in
:formula_43
which equals formula_44.

In the last step the result is multiplied with formula_37 from Bob&#x27;s private key to end up with the original message m
:formula_46
:formula_47
Which indeed is the original message Alice has sent to Bob!

==Attacks==

Since the proposal of NTRU several attacks on the NTRUEncrypt public key cryptosystem have been introduced. Most attacks are focused on making a total break by finding the secret key f instead of just recovering the message m.
If f is known to have very few non-zero coefficients Eve can successfully mount a brute force attack by trying all values for f. When Eve wants to know whether f´ is the secret key, she simply calculates formula_48. If it has small coefficients it might be the secret key f, and Eve can test if f´ is the secret key by using it to decrypt a message she encrypted herself.
Eve could also try values of g and test if formula_49has small values.

It is possible to mount a meet-in-the-middle attack which is more powerful. It can cut the search time by square root. The attack is based on the property that formula_50.

Eve wants to find 
formula_51 and formula_52 such that formula_53 holds and such that they have the property 
:formula_54
:formula_55

If f has &quot;d&quot; one&#x27;s and &quot;N&quot;-&quot;d&quot; zero&#x27;s, then Eve creates all possible formula_51 and formula_52 in which they both have length formula_58 (e.g. formula_51 covers the formula_58 lowest coefficients of f and formula_52 the highest)
with &quot;d&quot;/2 one&#x27;s. Then she computes formula_62 for all formula_51 and orders them in bins based on the first k coordinates. After that she computes all formula_64 and orders them in bins not only based on the first k coordinates, but also based on what happens if you add 1 to the first k coordinates. Then you check the bins that contain both formula_51 and formula_52 and see if the property formula_67 holds.

The lattice reduction attack is one of the best known and one of the most practical methods to break the NTRUEncrypt. In a way it can be compared to the factorization of the modulus in RSA. The most used algorithm for the lattice reduction attack is the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász algorithm.
Because the public key h contains both f and g one can try to obtain them from h. It is however too hard to find the secret key when the NTRUEncrypt parameters are chosen secure enough. The lattice reduction attack becomes harder if the dimension of the lattice gets bigger and the shortest vector gets longer.
The chosen ciphertext attack is also a method which recovers the secret key f and thereby results in a total break. In this attack Eve tries to obtain her own message from the ciphertext and thereby tries to obtain the secret key. In this attack Eve doesn&#x27;t have any interaction with Bob.

How it works:

First Eve creates a ciphertext formula_68 such that formula_69 and formula_70 
When Eve writes down the steps to decipher e (without actually calculating the values since she does not know f) she finds formula_71:

:formula_72
:formula_73
:formula_74

In which formula_75 such that
:formula_76

Example:
:formula_77
:formula_78

Then &quot;K&quot; becomes formula_79.

Reducing the coefficients of a mod &quot;p&quot; really reduces the coefficients of formula_80. After multiplication with formula_37, Eve finds:
:formula_82
:formula_83

Because c was chosen to be a multiple of &quot;p&quot;, m can be written as
:formula_84

Which means that formula_85.

Now if f and g have few coefficients which are the same at the same factors, &quot;K&quot; has few non zero coefficients and is thereby small. By trying different values of &quot;K&quot; the attacker can recover f.

By encrypting and decrypting a message according to the NTRUEncrypt the attacker can check whether the function f is the correct secret key or not.

==Security and performance improvements==

Using the latest suggested parameters (see below) the NTRUEncrypt public key cryptosystem is secure to most attacks. There continues however to be a struggle between performance and security. It is hard to improve the security without slowing down the speed, and vice versa.

One way to speed up the process without damaging the effectiveness of the algorithm, is to make some changes in the secret key f.
First, construct f such that formula_86, in which F is a small polynomial (i.e. coefficients {-1,0, 1}). By constructing f this way, f is invertible mod &quot;p&quot;. In fact formula_87, which means that Bob does not have to actually calculate the inverse and that Bob does not have to conduct the second step of decryption. Therefore, constructing f this way saves a lot of time but it does not affect the security of the NTRUEncrypt because it is only easier to find formula_37 but f is still hard to recover.
In this case f has coefficients different from -1, 0 or 1, because of the multiplication by &quot;p&quot;. But because Bob multiplies by &quot;p&quot; to generate the public key h, and later on reduces the ciphertext modulo &quot;p&quot;, this will not have an effect on the encryption method.

Second, f can be written as the product of multiple polynomials, such that the polynomials have many zero coefficients. This way fewer calculations have to be conducted.

According to the 2020 NTRU NIST submission the following parameters are considered secure:

<text>The Los Angeles Music Center (officially the Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles County) is one of the largest performing arts centers in the United States. Located in downtown Los Angeles, The Music Center is composed of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Ahmanson Theatre, Mark Taper Forum, Roy &amp; Edna Disney CalArts Theatre (REDCAT), and Walt Disney Concert Hall.

Each year, The Music Center welcomes more than 1.3 million people to performances by its four internationally renowned resident companies: Los Angeles Philharmonic, Los Angeles Opera, Los Angeles Master Chorale, and Center Theatre Group (CTG) as well as performances by the dance series Glorya Kaufman Presents Dance at The Music Center. The center is home to on-going community events, arts festivals, outdoor concerts, participatory arts activities and workshops, and educational programs.

== History ==
In April 1955, Dorothy Chandler, wife of Los Angeles Times publisher Norman Chandler, began fundraising toward a permanent home for the Philharmonic. Ultimately Mrs. Chandler raised almost $20 million in private donations; the County provided the site and raised the remaining $14 million using mortgage revenue bonds.

The rest of the complex was completed in April 1967. The additional venues, the Mark Taper Forum and Ahmanson Theatre, were dedicated on April 9 and 12, 1967, respectively.

When the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion opened its doors on December 6, 1964, the twenty-eight-year-old Zubin Mehta led the Los Angeles Philharmonic in a program that included violinist Jascha Heifetz and performances of Strauss&#x27; Fanfare and Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto in D Major. The Mark Taper Forum, &quot;scandalizing the power structure of Los Angeles,&quot; according to its artistic director Gordon Davidson, with its provocative opening production of John Whiting&#x27;s The Devils. The Ahmanson Theatre opened with a performance of the Man of La Mancha by the Civic Light Opera. The first dramatic season at the Ahmanson featured Ingrid Bergman in O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s More Stately Mansions, signaling its intent to marry big-name playwrights with big-name stars.

Since its opening in 1964, The Music Center has seen the American debuts of Simon Rattle and Esa-Pekka Salonen, the world premieres of The Shadow Box, Zoot Suit, Children of a Lesser God, and Angels in America at the Taper, and performances by Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn, Katharine Hepburn, and Maggie Smith at the Ahmanson. The Philharmonic and L.A. Master Chorale joined forces to provide the accompaniment to Eisenstein&#x27;s restored silent film classic Alexander Nevsky. While the Civic Light Opera&#x27;s last season at The Music Center was in 1987, the Los Angeles Music Center Opera was formed in 1986. Its productions have included Wagner&#x27;s Tristan and Isolde directed by Jonathan Miller and designed by David Hockney.

The Music Center hosts the annual Los Angeles County Holiday Celebration on Christmas Eve since 1960 with performances from singers, dance groups and musicians. The event is free to everyone and it is televised on PBS SoCal.

=== Construction of Walt Disney Concert Hall and Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater ===
On October 23, 2003, The Music Center opened the Frank-Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, expanding the campus to . The 2,265-seat Concert Hall is home to the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Los Angeles Master Chorale. Walt Disney Concert Hall includes the 266-seat Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater (REDCAT) and outdoor program areas including the W. M. Keck Foundation Children&#x27;s Amphitheatre, seating 250-300 and the Nadine and Ed Carson amphitheatre seating 120.

=== Music Center Plaza renovation ===

The main plaza underwent a $40 million renovation project in July 2018. The project doubles the plaza&#x27;s capacity from 2,500 to 5,000 people.

== Venues ==
The main venues of the complex (which also includes some outdoor amphitheaters) are:
* Dorothy Chandler Pavilion: 3,197 seats
* Mark Taper Forum: 739 seats
* Ahmanson Theatre: 1,600 to 2,007 seats, depending on configuration
* Walt Disney Concert Hall: 2,265 seats
* Roy &amp; Edna Disney CalArts Theatre (REDCAT): 266 seats

== Photos from the Historic American Buildings Survey ==
== Public art ==
The 10-ton, 29-foot bronze sculpture &quot;Peace on Earth&quot; (1969 by Jacques Lipchitz, a Cubist sculptor who fled the Nazi occupation of Paris, was dedicated on May 4, 1969, and originally installed as the focal point of the Music Center plaza. His mammoth bronze sculpture shows a dove descending to Earth as a spirit of peace, further symbolized by a Madonna standing inside a tear-shaped canopy, supported by reclining lambs. Lawrence E. Deutsch and Lloyd Rigler donated $250,000 to commission a work for the fountain. The architects of The Music Center, Welton Becket and Associates, opposed placing sculpture in the plaza between the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Mark Taper Forum. However, after a two-year search, the Art Committee of The Music Center commissioned Lipchitz. In 2019, the sculpture was re-installed 100 feet west to accommodate a major Plaza renovation to improve accessibility.

Three years after the &quot;Peace on Earth&quot; installation in 1982, Frederick and Marcia Weisman donated the bronze sculpture &quot;Dance Door&quot; (1978) by Robert Graham to the Music Center. It consists of an ornamented hollow-centered bronze door hinged on a bronze frame in an open position. The door is constructed of approximately seven welded case panels on each side, containing low relief abstracted figures of dancers.

== Resident companies ==
The complex has four resident companies:
* Los Angeles Philharmonic
* Los Angeles Opera
* Los Angeles Master Chorale
* Center Theatre Group

=== Education ===
Since its inception in 1979, The Music Center and its family programs has served more than 16 million and currently serves nearly 1 million students and teachers each year. The Music Center believes the arts enhance the lives of all people and are crucial to the development of every child. The Music Center-designed curriculum materials are included in art textbooks published by McGraw Hill in use across the country and are also available on The Music Center&#x27;s website.

Education and family programs include &quot;World City&quot;, the &quot;Blue Ribbon Children&#x27;s Festival&quot;, the &quot;Very Special Arts Festival&quot; and the &quot;Spotlight Awards&quot;.

=== Active Arts ===
Launched in July 2004 and designed to expand the public&#x27;s experience associated with the performing arts, Active Arts at The Music Center extends beyond the more formal experience associated with performing arts centers. Active Arts programs engage people from diverse backgrounds and experiences and establishes an ongoing series of admission-free or low-cost recreational art-making events that encourage people to sing, dance, play music and tell stories together just for the sheer enjoyment and love of it.

Active Arts programs cut across cross-cultural boundaries and encourage people to participate for the sole purpose of art-making and include &quot;Dance Downtown&quot;, &quot;Drum Downtown&quot;, &quot;A Taste of Dance&quot;, &quot;Public Practice&quot;, &quot;Friday Night Sing-Along&quot; and &quot;The Music Center Holiday Sing-Along&quot;.

=== Glorya Kaufman Presents Dance at The Music Center ===
Over the past ten years, The Music Center has developed an ambitious dance presentation program, which has established a distinguished reputation – locally, nationally, and internationally. The endeavor began in 2000 with The Music Center&#x27;s sold-out presentation of the Bolshoi Ballet in its historic production of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; as well as new interpretation of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

Since then, The Music Center has presented a broad array of ensembles, including New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Dance Theatre of Harlem, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Ballet Nacional de Cuba, Beijing Modern Dance Company, Merce Cunningham Dance Company, Kirov Ballet of the Mariinsky Theatre, Nuevo Ballet Español, Miami City Ballet and Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg.

== Governance and administration ==
The Music Center is governed by a Board of Directors chaired by Lisa Specht. The Music Center president and chief executive officer is Rachel S. Moore (2015). The County of Los Angeles owns The Music Center venues and provides funding for the maintenance, operations, grounds-keeping, security and ushers. Revenue from the operation of The Music Center garages offsets these expenses. The Music Center and the four resident companies are responsible for the productions presented in the theatres. The Music Center maintains and operates the buildings and the grounds and oversees occupancy of the theatres, restaurant facilities and The Music Center Archives.

=== Membership groups ===
The Music Center has a number of organized membership groups:
* The Blue Ribbon, founded by Mrs. Chandler in 1968, has a membership of more than 450 women leaders of Los Angeles who champion the performing arts and make substantial financial contributions to the center&#x27;s community programs and its resident companies annually.
* Center Dance Association (CDA) is dedicated to promoting educational programming related to dance, expanding dance audiences in Los Angeles and creating special events related to dance for the enjoyment and further education of its membership.
* The Music Center Leadership Council (originally known as &quot;Fraternity of Friends&quot;), 1978–2018, consisted of businessmen and entertainment industry leaders who shared an interest in the performing arts and the well-being of The Music Center.

<text>Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access (FOMA) is the brand name of the W-CDMA-based 3G telecommunications services being offered by the Japanese telecommunications service provider NTT DoCoMo. It is an implementation of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and was the world&#x27;s first 3G mobile data service to commence commercial operations.

NTT DoCoMo also offers HSPA services branded FOMA High-Speed (FOMAハイスピード), which offers downlink speeds up to 7.2 Mbit/s and uplink speeds up to 5.7 Mbit/s.

==History==
The W-CDMA air interface was accepted by the ITU as one of several air interfaces for the IMT-2000telecom initiative and by the ETSI as one of three air interfaces for the UMTS cellular network standard.

NTT DoCoMo originally planned to launch the world&#x27;s first 3G services, initially branded Frontier of Mobile Multimedia Access (FOMA), in May 2001. However, by May 2001, NTT DoCoMo had postponed the full-scale launch until October 2001, claiming they had not completed testing of their entire infrastructure, and would only launch an introductory trial to 4,000 subscribers. In doing so, they also renamed the service to Freedom of Mobile multimedia Access. In June 2001 trial subscribers complained the mobile phones had insufficient battery life and crashed frequently, that there was inadequate network coverage, and that there were security issues within the handset itself. As a result, DoCoMo recalled 1,500 handsets by the end of June 2001. FOMA successfully launched in October 2001, providing mobile telecommunications coverage to Tokyo and Yokohama.

Initially - as the first full-scale 3G service in the world - The first FOMA handsets were of an experimental nature, targeting early adopters, were larger than previous handsets, had poor battery life, while the initial network only covered the center of Japan&#x27;s largest towns and cities. For the first 1–2 years, FOMA was essentially an experimental service for early adopters - mainly centered around communication industry professionals.

As NTT DoCoMo did not wait for the completion and finalization of the 3G Release 99 network specification, their 3G W-CDMA network was initially incompatible with the internationally deployed UMTS standard. However, in 2004 NTT DoCoMo performed wide-scale upgrades on its network, bringing it into compliance with the specification and enabling 100% compatibility with UMTS handsets, including incoming and outgoing roaming.

Around March 2004, the FOMA network achieved mass adoption, and handset sales soared. As of September 29, 2007, FOMA had over 40 million subscribers.

== Terminals ==
NTT DoCoMo offers a wide range of FOMA branded handsets, which are made specifically for the Japanese market. FOMA handsets differ from Western UMTS handsets in several aspects, for example:

* A standardized menu structure and chargers.
* Japan-specific features such as i-mode or Osaifu-Keitai (electronic wallet).
* Multiband-support, which includes band VI at 800 MHz for FOMA Plus-Area (newer models).
* No support for dual-mode operation with GSM/EDGE (except some models branded by DoCoMo as World Wing).

== Frequency allocations ==
In metropolitan areas, FOMA uses the UMTS band I around 2100 MHz, which has been originally assigned to IMT-2000 services worldwide, except in the Americas. In order to improve coverage in rural and mountainous areas, NTT DoCoMo also offers FOMA services in the 800 MHz band originally assigned to the 2G PDC mova service, which corresponds to UMTS band VI and is similar to band V used in the United States. These extended service areas are branded FOMA Plus-Area (FOMAプラスエリア) and require multiband terminals.

<text>Dorothy Buffum Chandler (May 19, 1901 – July 6, 1997; born Dorothy Mae Buffum) was an American philanthropist. She is known for her contributions to Los Angeles performing arts and culture. 

==Personal life==

Dorothy Mae Buffum was born in 1901 in La Fayette, Illinois. Nicknamed &quot;Buff&quot; or &quot;Buffie&quot;, her family moved to Long Beach, California in 1905. Her father, Charles Abel Buffum, alongside her uncle, Edwin, opened a store that would become later become the Buffums department store chain. Buffum attended Long Beach High School, and was described as a competitive student for her gender, especially against the opposite sex. An enthusiastic sprinter, she once marked that “I didn’t take to boys much except to run against them and beat them&quot;.

Buffum went on to study history at Stanford University, and was a member of the Pi Beta Phi sorority. At a school dance, she met fellow student Norman Chandler, the eldest son of the family that had published the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; since 1883. The couple married in 1922, and had two children, Camilla and Otis, both born in 1927. The Chandlers went on to have eight grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. In 1945, her husband became publisher of the &quot;Times,&quot; a position he held until he was succeeded by their son, Otis, in 1960. He died in 1973, and Chandler never remarried. The family lived in Los Tiempos (the Times), a grand house on Lorraine Blvd. in Windsor Square, Los Angeles, where she lived until her death in 1997.

==Career==

===Times Mirror Company===
Chandler worked at the &quot;Times&quot; or its parent, the Times Mirror Company, from 1948 to 1976. She was a director of Times Mirror from 1955 until 1973, when she was named director emeritus.She initiated the Times Woman of the Year award, which was given to 243 women from 1950 through 1976.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Chandler to his Committee on Education Beyond the High School and, in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson named her to the U.S. Advisory Commission on Information.

As the wife of the publisher of the city&#x27;s leading newspaper, Chandler became active in Los Angeles cultural circles. In 1951, a financial crisis closed the Hollywood Bowl during its summer season. Chandler chaired a committee that organized a series of fundraising concerts that led to the Bowl&#x27;s reopening. She later served as president of its parent organization, the Southern California Symphony Association. Chandler served as a regent and chairwoman of the Building Committee of the University of California from 1954 to 1968, during its period of most rapid growth, when the system grew from five to nine campuses. She also served as a trustee of Occidental College from 1952 to 1967.

Chandler later led a nine-year effort to build a performing arts center for the city of Los Angeles. In 1955, she raised $400,000 at a benefit concert at the Ambassador Hotel featuring Dinah Shore, Danny Kaye and Jack Benny. Chandler sought funds from both the long established &quot;old money&quot; families of Pasadena, but also to &quot;new money&quot; communities on the city&#x27;s Westside and Hollywood, many of whom were Jewish. Attorney Paul Ziffren remarked that &quot;before the Music Center, Jews were not a part of the social life of this community.&quot; He regarded Chandler to be &quot;primarily responsible for opening up this community in terms of Jews and Gentiles.&quot; Chandler eventually garnered enough donations to cover $20 million of the estimated $35 million total cost; the remainder was paid through private bond sales. 

Chandler was featured on the cover of the December 18, 1964, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which praised her fundraising efforts as &quot;perhaps the most impressive display of virtuoso money-raising and civic citizenship in the history of U.S. womanhood.&quot; The Los Angeles Music Center held its first performance on December 6, 1964. Chandler hired its first conductor, Zubin Mehta, to lead the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra. The complex was completed in 1967, consisting of three venues: the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, named in honor of Chandler, the Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre. The Chandler Pavilion served as the home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1964 until 2003, when the Music Center opened its fourth hall, the Walt Disney Concert Hall.

Author David Halberstam referred to Chandler as a &quot;woman before her time. A feminist in pioneer country. Always, above all else, a presence.&quot; Former Mayor Tom Bradley declared her &quot;a giant in the cultural life of Los Angeles. We shall always remember her whenever we see the Music Center, knowing that without her vision and energetic leadership, it would not have been built in our lifetime.&quot; On September 17, 2005, the Walt Disney Concert Hall held a Dorothy Chandler memorial concert. 

==Awards==
* 1971: the Herbert Hoover Medal for Distinguished Service, awarded by the Stanford University Alumni Assn.
*1974: Humanitarian Award from Variety Clubs International

<doc id="481592" wikidata="Q723669" url="?curid=481592" title="Enric Miralles">
<text>Enric Miralles Moya (12 February 1955 – 3 July 2000) was a Spanish architect from Barcelona, Catalonia. He graduated from the Barcelona School of Architecture (ETSAB) at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) in 1978. After establishing his reputation with a number of collaborations with his first wife Carme Pinós; the couple separated in 1991. Miralles later married fellow architect Benedetta Tagliabue, and the two practiced together as EMBT Architects. Miralles&#x27; &quot;magnum opus&quot; and his largest project, the Scottish Parliament Building, was unfinished at the time of his death.

==Life==
In 1978, Miralles completed his examinations at the &quot;Escola Tècnica Superior d&#x27;Arquitectura&quot; (ETSAB) in Barcelona. From 1973 to 1978, he worked in the architect&#x27;s office of Albert Viaplana and Helio Piñón. Whilst there—among other things—he was involved in the construction of the &quot;Plaça dels Països Catalans&quot;, the forecourt for the Estació de Sants. In 1984, after several architectural competition awards, Miralles formed his own office in Barcelona with his first wife Carme Pinós, which they led together until 1991. Within the rising Spanish architecture scene of the late 1980s following the death of Francisco Franco, their unusual buildings attracted international attention. As a result, they received numerous commissions from Spain and overseas. After their separation, Miralles and Pinós continued to work in separate offices.

In 1993, Miralles formed a new practice with his second wife, the Italian architect Benedetta Tagliabue, under the name &quot;EMBT Architects&quot;. She resumed the practice under his name after his death. The most important projects; the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh and the multistoried building for the Spanish gas company Gas Natural in Barcelona, were only finished after his death. Miralles died at the age of 45 as the result of a brain tumor.

==Architecture==
The independent architectural language of Miralles can be difficult to classify in terms of contemporary architecture. It is influenced by Spanish architects, such as Alejandro de la Sota, José Antonio Coderch and Josep Maria Jujol, and also from international greats such as Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn and Alvar Aalto and the Russian Constructivist movement of the early 20th century. The freely formed buildings utilising massive building materials and steel, develop from their relationship with the environment and connect themselves to it. The form is constructed using often unusual materials which are generally left with natural surfaces. Form and material interpret the place, traditions and history in a personal and poetic art, as his critics attest. From the starting point of the townscape or landscape he would design a building in its totality, down to the details of the furnishing and the exterior installations. Therefore, the execution of the details was just as important to the communication of meaning as the main form. Both were developed over a large number of designs and with numerous models as the main tool of the design process.

Charles Jencks, writing on the problems surrounding the construction of the Scottish Parliament Building and the controversial reception of its design for &quot;Architecture Today&quot;, summed up Miralles&#x27; architectural style:
Miralles, like many other postmodern architects, has a preference for piling on the motifs and ideas: upturned boats, keel shapes, deep window reveals like a castle, crow-steps, prow shapes, diagonal gutters, &#x27;bamboo bundles&#x27; and above all the dark granite gun-shape that repeats as an ornamental motif at a huge scale. Everywhere broken silhouettes compete for attention, just like the alleyways next door. That&#x27;s fine, and contextual, but it&#x27;s quite a meal. As a result of the complexity, the parliament is really a kind of small city, with much too much to digest in one short three-hour sitting. The Scottish parliament will take time to judge: maybe not 50 years but three or four visits, long enough to absorb all the richness and get used to those jumpy black granite guns, the most arbitrary of several questionable ornaments.

==Academia==

Miralles was an active teacher at numerous universities. In 1985, he became a professor at the ETSAB in Barcelona. During 1990, he took over the conceptional design chair at the Städelschule in Frankfurt am Main. In 1993, Miralles received an invitation from Harvard University to occupy the Kenzo Tange chair. He taught as a guest lecturer at Columbia University in New York, Princeton University in New Jersey, the Architectural Association in London, the Berlage Instituut in Rotterdam, the Mackintosh School of Architecture in Glasgow and the Universities of Buenos Aires and Mexico City.

<doc id="481596" wikidata="Q4848556" url="?curid=481596" title="Baine Kerr">
<text>Baine Perkins Kerr (August 24, 1919 – May 20, 2008) was a prominent Houston lawyer who was a partner in the law firm of Baker and Botts, where he managed the corporate law department, before he joined Pennzoil.

==Career==
Kerr was president of Pennzoil and on the board of directors from 1964 to 1994. He served in World War II, and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. He married Mildred C. Kerr in 1942, with whom he would raise four children, Baine P. Kerr, Jr., John Caldwell Kerr, James Robinson Kerr, and Mary Kerr.

In the 1980s he served on the &quot;Energy Engineering Board&quot; of the National Research Council.

In 1989 he was paid a $10 million bonus for his work on a lawsuit for Pennzoil that resulted in a $3 billion settlement from Texaco.

==Friendship with George Bush==
Kerr and his family were longtime friends of George H. W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, whom they used to live down the street from. According to an article by Walter Pincus and Bob Woodward in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; entitled &quot;Doing Well with Help from Family, Friends,&quot; (August 11, 1988) when Bush was running against Lloyd Bentsen for senator in 1970, Kerr advised Bush on a proposed business deal involving a loan request from a man named Victor Flaherty, who needed money to buy Fidelity Printing Company. Kerr recommended that Bush make the loan, but that he also demand some stock in Fidelity Printing as part of the deal. When Fidelity Printing was sold, Bush cashed in his stock for $99,600 in profit, a gain of 1,900 percent on his original investment. When Bush became president he named his presidential yacht &quot;Fidelity&quot; because of this business deal.

<text>The Tualatin River is a tributary of the Willamette River in Oregon in the United States. The river is about long, and it drains a fertile farming region called the Tualatin Valley southwest and west of Portland at the northwest corner of the Willamette Valley. There are approximately 500,000 people residing on 15 percent of the land in the river&#x27;s watershed.

==Course==
The Tualatin River arises near Windy Point on the eastern side of the Northern Oregon Coast Range. It begins in the Tillamook State Forest in Washington County and flows about to the Willamette River near West Linn in Clackamas County. Along the way, it falls from about above sea level to about , most of that occurring in its first . From the unincorporated community of Cherry Grove, from the mouth, the river falls only about in meanders that trend generally east across the relatively flat Tualatin Valley.

From its source, the river flows south for about before turning east to parallel to Blind Cabin Ridge, which is to the river&#x27;s . Shortly thereafter, the river plunges over the Ki-a-Kuts Falls, then receives Maple Creek from the and then Sunday Creek, also from the left, at river mile (RM) 76.7 (RK 123.4). Lee Creek enters from the left and Patten Creek from the right before the river reaches Hillsboro Reservoir and then Haines Falls at about RM 73 (RK 117). Hillsboro Reservoir Road and Southwest Lee Falls Road run roughly parallel to the river along its left bank from the reservoir to the unincorporated community of Cherry Grove. Over the next stretch, the river runs roughly parallel to Hagerty Ridge, which is on the right. About further downstream, the river goes over Lee Falls and, shortly thereafter, Little Lee Falls before reaching Cherry Grove, which is on the river&#x27;s left at the west end of Patton Valley. At Cherry Grove, the river passes under Roaring Creek Road, receives Roaring Creek from the right, passes under Bruce Road and Southwest S Road, and receives Hering Creek from the left. Thereafter, it flows under Northwest Mount Richmond Road and receives Mercer Creek from the left about from the river&#x27;s mouth. Below this, Black Jack Creek enters from the left, and the river passes under Oregon Route 47 and flows by the city of Gaston, which is to the right.

Turning north near Gaston and meandering roughly parallel to Route 47 to the west (left), the river receives Wapato Creek, which flows through the former Wapato Lake, from the right and Scoggins Creek, which drains Henry Hagg Lake, from the left at RM 60 (RK 97). Soon, O&#x27;Neill Creek enters from the left, and shortly thereafter, the river passes under Southwest Spring Hill Road, then receives Dilley Creek from the left at about RM 57.5 (RK 92.5). At this point, the unincorporated community of Dilley is on the left. At Dilley, the stream meanders east away from the highway and soon receives Carpenter Creek from the left and then Gales Creek. Along this stretch of the river, the city of Forest Grove is north (left) of the river. Meandering generally east, the river passes under Southwest Fern Hill Road, by the city of Cornelius to the left and the unincorporated community of Blooming to the right, and passes under Golf Course Road about from the mouth. Dairy Creek enters from the left at about RM 45 (RK 72) as the river approaches Hillsboro, which is to the river&#x27;s left. Wandering through Jackson Bottom and the Jackson Bottom Wetlands Preserve, the river passes under Oregon Route 219 (Southwest Hillsboro Highway), and soon receives Jackson Slough from the left, then Davis Creek from the right at RM 40 (RK 64).

Passing under Minter Bridge Road about from the mouth, and then Rood Bridge Road, the river wanders by the Meriwether National Golf Course which is on its right and The Reserve Vineyards &amp; Golf Club, which is to the left, and receives Rock Creek, Gordon Creek, and Butternut Creek, all from the left. Flowing south from the vicinity of the golf course, the river runs roughly parallel to River Road, which is on its left. It passes under Harris Bridge, which carries Oregon Route 10 and Oregon Route 208 (Southwest Farmington Road) at the unincorporated community of Farmington. Further downstream, it receives Christensen and Burris creeks from the right and continues south until turning east again at about RM 30 (RK 48). Shortly thereafter, it flows by the unincorporated community of Scholls, where it receives McFee Creek from the right before passing under Scholls Bridge and Oregon Route 210. Entering the Tualatin River National Wildlife Refuge at about RM 25 (RK 40).

Leaving the wildlife refuge about later, the rivers meanders around the unincorporated community of Bull Mountain, which is on its left (north), passes under Roy Rogers Road, receives Chicken Creek and Rock Creek from the right, then passes under Oregon Route 99W (Southwest Pacific Highway) at King City. The river continues by Avalon Park, which is on its left, flows through Cook Park in Tigard, which is on its left, and forms the north boundary of the Tualatin Country Club, which is on the right. Immediately thereafter, the river receives Fanno Creek from the left just after passing under a Portland &amp; Western Railroad bridge and a pedestrian bridge between Tigard and Durham on the left (north) and Tualatin on the right. Durham City Park is on the left bank, and Tualatin Park is on the right. The stream passes under another Portland &amp; Western Railroad bridge, then under Southwest Boones Ferry Road and then under Interstate 5, the latter at about RM 8 (RK 13), and enters Clackamas County.

Shortly thereafter, the river passes Browns Ferry Park, which is on the river&#x27;s right, and then Canal Acres Park, on the left. At the east end of the park, Saum Creek enters from the right, and the Oswego Canal, which carries water from the Tualatin River to Oswego Lake in Lake Oswego, is on the left. Beyond the canal entrance, the river passes River Run Park, which is on the left. Soon Athey Creek enters from the right and Pecan Creek from the left before the river passes under Southwest Stafford Road near the unincorporated area of Wankers Corner and flows past the unincorporated community of Shadowood. In its final , the river receives Wilson Creek from the right, passes under Interstate 205 and then under Southwest Borland Road, and receives Fields Creek from the left. It flows by Swift Shore Park, which is on the left, under Southwest Pete&#x27;s Mountain Road, by Willamette Park, also on the left, and enters the Willamette River at West Linn, about from the larger river&#x27;s confluence with the Columbia River.the mouth is five miles away from oswego lake. 
the closest tributary to the mouth is the fanno creek. 

===Discharge===
The highest flow ever recorded in the river was on February 10, 1996, at the West Linn gage. The lowest flow ever recorded at this gage was between July 30 and August 2, 1966. This flow does not include the estimated flow of from the river through the Lake Oswego Canal.

==History==

The Tualatin River was named by the local Native American band, the Atafalati, that lived in the Tualatin Valley. The name translated as sluggish or lazy. Early settlers called it the &quot;Quality River&quot;.

The valley of the Tualatin was an important early farming region in the settlement of Oregon. The building of Canyon Road, a plank road to the Tualatin Valley from Portland, in 1856 is considered by historians to be one of the main reasons for Portland&#x27;s rise as the dominant city in the region. The valley contains many natural wetlands, some of which have been designated the Tualatin River National Wildlife Refuge, and others are protected at Jackson Bottom Wetlands Preserve.

==Pollution==
The drainage area of the river is approximately with 27 creeks feeding into the Tualatin. Its watershed is 15 percent urbanized, 35 percent agricultural, and 50 percent forested. The river drops in elevation during its first and then only an additional for the remaining of its course. This creates a slow river for the majority of the course, creating problems with pollution. Pollution reached a point that in 1989 local agencies were forced to begin cleaning up the river after the Tualatin failed water quality standards outlined in the Clean Water Act of 1972. It was the first river in the state to fail overall pollution limits.

<text>A mobile network operator (MNO), also known as a mobile network provider, mobile network carrier, mobile telco, wireless service provider, wireless carrier, wireless operator, wireless telco, or cellular company, is a telecommunications provider of services that sells, delivers and maintains mobile telephony services to an end user.

== Overview ==
A key defining characteristic of a mobile network operator is that it must own or control access to a radio spectrum license from a regulatory or government entity, and also that it must own or control the elements of the cellular network infrastructure necessary to provide services to subscribers over the licensed radio spectrum. In addition the operator would also contain other elements like the back haul infrastructure and provisioning computer systems.

A mobile network operator typically also has the necessary provisioning, billing, and customer care computer systems, and the marketing, customer care, and engineering organizations needed to sell, deliver, and bill for services. However, a mobile network operator can outsource any of these systems or functions and still be considered a mobile network operator.

In addition to obtaining revenue by offering retail services under its own brand, a mobile network operator may also sell access to network services at wholesale rates to mobile virtual network operators (MVNO).

<doc id="481604" wikidata="Q9045" url="?curid=481604" title="Chanakya">
<text>According to legendary narratives, preserved in various traditions dating from the 4th to 11th century CE, Chanakya (ISO: &quot;&quot;, ) was a Brahmin who assisted the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta in his rise to power and the establishment of the Maurya Empire. According to these narratives, Chanakya served as the chief advisor and Prime Minister of the both emperors Chandragupta Maurya and his son Bindusara.

Chanakya was traditionally identified with Kauṭilya, the author of the ancient Indian political treatise, the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;. The &quot;Arthashastra&quot; is now thought with high probability to have been composed by multiple authors during the early centuries of the common era—several centuries after the Mauryan period—the backdated identification with Chanakya to have served to add prestige to the work.

==Chanakya-Chandragupta &quot;katha&quot; (legend)==
There is no documented historical information about Chanakya: narratives about him come from legendary accounts. Thomas Trautmann identifies four distinct accounts of the ancient Chanakya-Chandragupta &quot;katha&quot; (legend):
* Buddhist version: &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; (5th-6th cent. CE) and its commentary &quot;Vamsatthappakasini&quot; (Pali language)
* Jain version: &quot;Parishishtaparvan&quot; (12th cent. CE) by Hemachandra, based on 1st-8th century sources
* Kashmiri version: &quot;Kathasaritsagara&quot; (11th cent. CE) by Somadeva, &quot;Brihat-Katha-Manjari&quot; by Ksemendra
* Vishakhadatta&#x27;s version: &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot; (4th-8th cent. CE) , a Sanskrit play by Vishakhadatta; largely fictional

In all the four versions, Chanakya feels insulted by the Nanda king, and vows to destroy him. After dethroning the Nanda, he installs Chandragupta as the new king.

=== Buddhist version (5th-6th cent. CE) ===

====Source====
The legend of Chanakya and Chandragupta is detailed in the Pali-language Buddhist chronicles of Sri Lanka. It is not mentioned in &quot;Dipavamsa&quot;, the oldest of these chronicles. The earliest Buddhist source to mention the legend is &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, which is generally dated between fifth and sixth centuries CE. &quot;Vamsatthappakasini&quot; (also known as &quot;Mahvamsa Tika&quot;), a commentary on &quot;Mahavamsa,&quot; provides some more details about the legend. Its author is unknown, and it is dated variously from sixth century CE to 13th century CE. Some other texts provide additional details about the legend; for example, the &quot;Maha-Bodhi-Vamsa&quot; and the &quot;Atthakatha&quot; give the names of the nine Nanda kings said to have preceded Chandragupta.

====Narrative====
According to the Buddhist legend, the Nanda emperors who preceded Chandragupta were robbers-turned-rulers. Chanakya (IAST: Cāṇakka in &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;) was a Brahmin from Takkāsila (Takshashila). He was well-versed in three Vedas and politics. He was born with canine teeth, which were believed to be a mark of royalty. His mother feared that he would neglect her after becoming an emperor. To pacify her, Chanakya broke his teeth.

Chanakya had an ugly appearance, accentuated by his broken teeth and crooked feet. One day, the Emperor Dhana Nanda organized an alms-giving ceremony for Brahmins. Chanakya went to Pupphapura (Pushpapura) to attend this ceremony. Disgusted by his appearance, the emperor ordered him to be thrown out of the assembly. Chanakya broke his sacred thread in anger, and cursed the emperor. The emperor ordered his arrest, but Chanakya escaped in the disguise of an Ājīvika. He befriended Dhananada&#x27;s son Pabbata, and instigated him to seize the throne. With help of a signet ring given by the prince, Chanakya fled the palace through a secret door.

Chanakya escaped to the Vinjha forest. There, he made 800 million gold coins (&quot;kahapana&quot;s), using a secret technique that allowed him to turn 1 coin into 8 coins. After hiding this money, he started searching for a person worthy of replacing Dhana Nanda. One day, he saw a group of children playing: the young Chandragupta (called Chandagutta in &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;) played the role of an emperor, while other boys pretended to be vassals, ministers, or robbers. The &quot;robbers&quot; were brought before Chandragupta, who ordered their limbs to be cut off, but then miraculously re-attached them. Chandragupta had been born in a royal family, but was brought up by a hunter after his father was killed by an usurper, and the devatas caused his mother to abandon him. Astonished by the boy&#x27;s miraculous powers, Chanakya paid 1000 gold coins to his foster-father, and took Chandragupta away, promising to teach him a trade.

Chanakya had two potential successors to Dhana Nanda: Pabbata and Chandragupta. He gave each of them an amulet to be worn around the neck with a woolen thread. One day, he decided to test them. While Chandragupta was asleep, he asked Pabbata to remove Chandragupta&#x27;s woolen thread without breaking it and without waking up Chandragupta. Pabbata failed to accomplish this task. Some time later, when Pabbata was sleeping, Chanakya challenged Chandragupta to complete the same task. Chandragupta retrieved the woolen thread by cutting off Pabbata&#x27;s head. For the next seven years, Chanakya trained Chandragupta for imperial duties. When Chandragupta became an adult, Chanakya dug up his hidden treasure of gold coins, and assembled an army.

The army of Chanadragupta and Chanakya invaded Dhana Nanda&#x27;s empire, but disbanded after facing a severe defeat. While wandering in disguise, the two men once listened to the conversation between a woman and her son. The child had eaten the middle of a cake, and thrown away the edges. The woman scolded him, saying that he was eating food like Chandragupta, who attacked the central part of the empire instead of conquering the border villages first. Chanakya and Chandragupta realized their mistake. They assembled a new army, and started conquering the border villages. Gradually, they advanced to the empire&#x27;s capital Pataliputra (Pāṭaliputta in &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;), where they killed the Emperor Dhana Nanda. Chanakya ordered a fisherman to find the place where Dhana Nanda had hidden his treasure. As soon as the fishermen informed Chanakya about its location, Chanakya had him killed. Chanakya anointed Chandragupta as the new emperor, and tasked a man named Paṇiyatappa with eliminating rebels and robbers from the empire.

Chanakya started mixing small doses of poison in the new emperor&#x27;s food to make him immune to poisoning attempts by the enemies. Chandragupta, who was not aware of this, once shared the food with his pregnant empress Durdhara, who was seven days away from delivery. Chanakya arrived just as the empress ate the poisoned morsel. Realizing that she was going to die, Chanakya decided to save the unborn child. He cut off the empress&#x27;s head and cut open her belly with a sword to take out the foetus. Over the next seven days, he placed the foetus in the belly of a goat freshly killed each day. After seven days, Chandragupta&#x27;s son was &quot;born&quot;. He was named Bindusara because his body was spotted with drops (&quot;bindu&quot;) of goat&#x27;s blood.

The earliest Buddhist legends do not mention Chanakya in their description of the Mauryan dynasty after this point. Dhammapala&#x27;s commentary on &quot;Theragatha&quot;, however, mentions a legend about Chanakya and a Brahmin named Subandhu. According to this account, Chanakya was afraid that the wise Subandhu would surpass him at Chandragupta&#x27;s court. So, he got Chandragupta to imprison Subandhu, whose son Tekicchakani escaped and became a Buddhist monk. The 16th-century Tibetan Buddhist author Taranatha mentions Chanakya as one of Bindusara&#x27;s &quot;great lords&quot;. According to him, Chanakya destroyed the nobles and kings of 16 towns and made Bindusara the master of all the territory between the eastern and the western seas (Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal).

=== Jain version (12th cent. CE, based on 1st-8th cent. CE sources) ===

====Source====
The Chandragupta-Chanakya legend is mentioned in several commentaries of the Shvetambara canon. The most well-known version of the Jain legend is contained in the &quot;Sthaviravali-Charita&quot; or &quot;Parishishta-Parvan&quot;, written by the 12th-century writer Hemachandra. Hemachandra&#x27;s account is based on the Prakrit &quot;kathanaka&quot; literature (legends and anecdotes) composed between the late first century CE and mid-8th century CE. These legends are contained in the commentaries (&quot;churni&quot;s and &quot;tika&quot;s) on canonical texts such as &quot;Uttaradhyayana&quot; and &quot;Avashyaka Niryukti&quot;. 

Thomas Trautmann believes that the Jain version is older and more consistent than the Buddhist version of the legend.

====Narrative====
According to the Jain account, Chanakya was born to two lay Jains (&quot;shravaka&quot;) named Chanin and Chaneshvari. His birthplace was the Chanaka village in Golla &quot;vishaya&quot; (district). The identity of &quot;Golla&quot; is not certain, but Hemachandra states that Chanakya was a Dramila, implying that he was a native of South India.

Chanakya was born with a full set of teeth. According to the monks, this was a sign that he would become a king in the future. Chanin did not want his son to become haughty, so he broke Chanakya&#x27;s teeth. The monks prophesied that the baby would go on to become a power behind the throne. Chanakya grew up to be a learned &quot;shravaka&quot;, and married a Brahmin woman. Her relatives mocked her for being married to a poor man. This motivated Chanakya to visit Pataliputra, and seek donations from the Emperor Nanda, who was famous for his generosity towards Brahmins. While waiting for the emperor at the imperial court, Chanakya sat on the emperor&#x27;s throne. A &quot;dasi&quot; (slave woman) courteously offered Chanakya the next seat, but Chanakya kept his kamandal (water pot) on it, while remaining seated on the throne. The servant offered him a choice of four more seats, but each time, he kept his various items on the seats, refusing to budge from the throne. Finally, the annoyed servant kicked him off the throne. Enraged, Chanakya vowed to uproot Nanda and his entire establishment, like &quot;a great wind uproots a tree&quot;.

Chanakya knew that he was prophesied to become a power behind the throne. So, he started searching for a person worthy of being a king. While wandering, he did a favour for the pregnant daughter of a village chief, on the condition that her child would belong to him. Chandragupta was born to this lady. When Chandragupta grew up, Chanakya came to his village and saw him playing &quot;king&quot; among a group of boys. To test him, Chanakya asked him for a donation. The boy told Chanakya to take the cows nearby, declaring that nobody would disobey his order. This display of power convinced Chanakya that Chandragupta was the one worthy of being a king.

Chanakya took Chandragupta to conquer Pataliputra, the capital of Nanda. He assembled an army using the wealth he had acquired through alchemy (&quot;dhatuvada-visaradan&quot;). The army suffered a severe defeat, forcing Chanakya and Chandragupta to flee the battlefield. They reached a lake while being pursued by an enemy officer. Chanakya asked Chandragupta to jump into the lake, and disguised himself as a meditating ascetic. When the enemy soldier reached the lake, he asked the &#x27;ascetic&#x27; if he had seen Chandragupta. Chanakya pointed at the lake. As the soldier removed his armour to jump into the lake, Chanakya took his sword and killed him. When Chandragupta came out of the water, Chanakya asked him, &quot;What went through your mind, when I disclosed your location to the enemy?&quot; Chandragupta replied that he trusted his master to make the best decision. This convinced Chanakya that Chandragupta would remain under his influence even after becoming the king. On another occasion, Chanakya similarly escaped the enemy by chasing away a washerman, and disguising himself as one. Once, he cut open the belly of a Brahmin who had just eaten food, and took out the food to feed a hungry Chandragupta.

One day, Chanakya and Chandragupta overheard a woman scolding her son. The child had burnt his finger by putting it in the middle of a bowl of hot gruel. The woman told her son that by not starting from the cooler edges, he was being foolish like Chanakya, who attacked the capital before conquering the bordering regions. Chanakya realized his mistake, and made a new plan to defeat Nanda. He formed an alliance with Parvataka, the king of a mountain kingdom called Himavatkuta, offering him half of Nanda&#x27;s empire.

After securing Parvataka&#x27;s help, Chanakya and Chandragupta started besieging the cities other than Pataliputra. One particular city offered a strong resistance. Chanakya entered this city disguised as a Shaivite mendicant, and declared that the siege would end if the idols of the seven mothers were removed from the town&#x27;s temple. As soon as the superstitious defenders removed the idols from the temple, Chanakya ordered his army to end the siege. When the defenders started celebrating their victory, Chanakya&#x27;s army launched a surprise attack and captured the town.

Gradually, Chanakya and Chandragupta subdued all the regions outside the capital. Finally, they captured Pataliputra and Chandragupta became the emperor. They allowed the Emperor Nanda to go into exile, with all the goods he could take on a cart. As Nanda and his family were leaving the city on a cart, his daughter saw Chandragupta, and fell in love with the new emperor. She chose him as her husband by svayamvara tradition. As she was getting off the cart, 9 spokes of the cart&#x27;s wheel broke. Interpreting this as an omen, Chanakya declared that Chandragupta&#x27;s dynasty would last for 9 generations.

Meanwhile, Parvataka fell in love with one of Nanda&#x27;s visha kanyas (poison girl, assassin). Chanakya approved the marriage, and Parvataka collapsed when he touched the girl during the wedding. Chanakya asked Chandragupta not to call a physician. Thus, Parvataka died and Chandragupta became the sole ruler of Nanda&#x27;s territories.

Chanakya then started consolidating the power by eliminating Nanda&#x27;s loyalists, who had been harassing people in various parts of the empire. Chanakya learned about a weaver who would burn any part of his house infested with cockroaches. Chanakya assigned the responsibility of crushing the rebels to this weaver. Soon, the empire was free of insurgents. Chanakya also burned a village that had refused him food in the past. He filled the imperial treasury by inviting rich merchants to his home, getting them drunk and gambling with a loaded dice.

Once, the empire suffered a 12-year long famine. Two young Jain monks started eating from the emperor&#x27;s plate, after making themselves invisible with a magic ointment. Chanakya sensed their presence by covering the palace floor with a powder, and tracing their footprints. At the next meal, he caught them by filling the dining room with thick smoke, which caused the monks&#x27; eyes to water, washing off the ointment. Chanakya complained about the young monks&#x27; behavior to the head monk Acharya Susthita. The Acharya blamed people for not being charitable towards monks, so Chanakya started giving generous alms to the monks.

Meanwhile, Chandragupta had been patronizing the non-Jain monks. Chanakya decided to prove to him that these men were not worthy of his patronage. He covered the floor of the palace area near the women&#x27;s rooms with powder and left the non-Jain monks there. Their footprints showed that they had sneaked up to the windows of the women&#x27;s rooms to peep inside. The Jain monks, who were assessed using the same method, stayed away from the women&#x27;s rooms. After seeing this, Chandragupta appointed the Jain monks as his spiritual counsellors.

Chanakya used to mix small doses of poison in Chandragupta&#x27;s food to make him immune to poisoning attempts. The emperor, unaware of this, once shared his food with Empress Durdhara. Chanakya entered the room at the instant she died. He cut open the dead empress&#x27;s belly and took out the baby. The baby, who had been touched by a drop (&quot;bindu&quot;) of the poison, was named Bindusara.

After Chandragupta abdicated the throne to become a Jain monk, Chanakya appointed Bindusara as the new emperor. Chanakya asked Bindusara to appoint a man named Subandhu as one of his ministers. However, Subandhu wanted to become a higher minister and grew jealous of Chanakya. So, he told Bindusara that Chanakya was responsible for the death of his mother. Bindusara confirmed the allegations with the nurses, who told him that Chanakya had cut open the belly of his mother. Bindusara became enraged, and started hating Chanakya. As a result, Chanakya, who had grown very old by this time, retired and decided to starve himself to death. Meanwhile, Bindusara learned the detailed circumstances of his birth, and implored Chanakya to resume his ministerial duties. After failing to pacify Chanakya, the emperor ordered Subandhu to convince Chanakya to give up his suicide plan. Subandhu, while pretending to appease Chanakya, burned him to death. Subandhu then took possession of Chanakya&#x27;s home. Chanakya had anticipated this, and before retiring, he had set up a cursed trap for Subandhu. He had left behind a chest with a hundred locks. Subandhu broke the locks, hoping to find precious jewels. He found a sweet-smelling perfume and immediately inhaled it. But then his eyes fell on a birch bark note with a curse written on it. The note declared that anybody who smelled this perfume will have to either become a monk or face death. Subandhu tested the perfume on another man, and then fed him luxurious food (something that the monks abstain from). The man died, and then Subandhu was forced to become a monk to avoid death.

According to another Jain text – the &quot;Rajavali-Katha&quot; – Chanakya accompanied Chandragupta to forest for retirement, once Bindusara became the emperor.

=== Kashmiri version (11th cent. CE) ===

====Source====
&quot;Brihatkatha-Manjari&quot; by Kshemendra and &quot;Kathasaritsagara&quot; by Somadeva are two 11th-century Kashmiri Sanskrit collections of legends. Both are based on a now-lost Prakrit-language &quot;Brihatkatha-Sarit-Sagara&quot;, which was based on the now-lost Paishachi-language &quot;Brihatkatha&quot; (before 3rd cent. CE) by &quot;Gunadhya&quot;. The Chanakya-Chandragupta legend in these collections features another character, named Shakatala (IAST: Śakaṭāla).

==== Kashmiri narrative ====
The Kashmiri version of the legend goes like this: Vararuchi (identified with Katyayana), Indradatta and Vyadi were three disciples of the sage Varsha. Once, on behalf of their guru Varsha, they travelled to Ayodhya to seek a gurudakshina (guru&#x27;s fee) from Emperor Nanda. As they arrived to meet Nanda, the emperor died. Using his yogic powers, Indradatta entered Nanda&#x27;s body and granted Vararuchi&#x27;s request for 10 million gold dinars (gold coins). The imperial minister Shakatala realized what was happening, and had Indradatta&#x27;s body burnt. But before he could take any action against the fake emperor (Indradatta in Nanda&#x27;s body, also called Yogananda), the emperor had him arrested. Shakatala and his 100 sons were imprisoned and were given food sufficient only for one person. Shakatala&#x27;s 100 sons starved to death, so that their father could live to take revenge.

Meanwhile, the fake emperor appointed Vararuchi as his minister. As the emperor&#x27;s character kept deteriorating, a disgusted Vararuchi retired to a forest as an ascetic. Shakatala was then restored as the minister, but kept planning his revenge. One day, Shakatala came across Chanakya, a Brahmin who was uprooting all the grass in his path, because one blade of the grass had pricked his foot. Shakatala realized that he could use a man so vengeful to destroy the fake emperor. He invited Chanakya to the emperor&#x27;s assembly, promising him 100,000 gold coins for presiding over a ritual ceremony.

Shakatala hosted Chanakya in his own house and treated him with great respect. But the day Chanakya arrived at the imperial court, Shakatala got another Brahmin named Subandhu to preside over the ceremony. Chanakya felt insulted, but Shakatala blamed the emperor for this dishonour. Chanakya then untied his topknot (sikha), and vowed not to re-tie it until the emperor was destroyed. The emperor ordered his arrest, but he escaped to Shakatala&#x27;s house. There, using materials supplied by Shakatala, he performed a magic ritual which made the emperor sick. The king died of a fever after 7 days.

Shakatala then executed Hiranyagupta, the son of the fake emperor. He anointed Chandragupta, the son of the real emperor Nanda, as the new emperor (in Kshemendra&#x27;s version, it is Chanakya who installs Chandragupta as the new emperor). Shakatala also appointed Chanakya as the imperial priest (&quot;rajpurohita&quot;). Having achieved his revenge, he then retired to the forest as an ascetic.

=== Mudrarakshasa version (4th-8th cent. CE) ===

====Source====
&quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot; (&quot;The signet ring of Rakshasa&quot;) is a Sanskrit play by Vishakhadatta. Its date is uncertain, but it mentions the Huna, who invaded northern India during the Gupta period. Therefore, it could not have been composed before the Gupta era. It is dated variously from the late fourth century to the eighth century. The &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot; legend contains narratives not found in other versions of the Chanakya-Chandragupta legend. Because of this difference, Trautmann suggests that most of it is fictional or legendary, without any historical basis.

==== Mudrarakshasa narrative (4th-8th cent. CE)====
According to the &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot; version, the Emperor Nanda once removed Chanakya from the &quot;first seat of the empire&quot; (this possibly refers to Chanakya&#x27;s expulsion from the emperor&#x27;s assembly). For this reason, Chanakya vowed not to tie his top knot (&quot;shikha&quot;) until the complete destruction of Nanda. Chanakya made a plan to dethrone Nanda, and replace him with Chandragupta, his son by a lesser empress. Chanakya engineered Chandragupta&#x27;s alliance with another powerful king Parvateshvara (or Parvata), and the two rulers agreed to divide Nanda&#x27;s territory after subjugating him. Their allied army included Bahlika, Kirata, Parasika, Kamboja, Shaka, and Yavana soldiers. The army invaded Pataliputra (Kusumapura) and defeated the Nandas. Parvata is identified with King Porus by some scholars.

Nanda&#x27;s prime minister Rakshasa escaped Pataliputra, and continued resisting the invaders. He sent a vishakanya (poison girl) to assassinate Chandragupta. Chanakya had this girl assassinate Parvata instead, with the blame going to Rakshasa. However, Parvata&#x27;s son Malayaketu learned the truth about his father&#x27;s death and defected to Rakshasa&#x27;s camp. Chanakya&#x27;s spy Bhagurayana accompanied Malayaketu, pretending to be his friend.

Rakshasa continued to plot Chandragupta&#x27;s death, but all his plans were foiled by Chanakya. For example, once Rakshasa arranged for assassins to be transported to Chandragupta&#x27;s bedroom via a tunnel. Chanakya became aware of them by noticing a trail of ants carrying the leftovers of their food. He then arranged for the assassins to be burned to death.

Meanwhile, Parvata&#x27;s brother Vairodhaka became the ruler of his emperor. Chanakya convinced him that Rakshasa was responsible for killing his brother, and agreed to share half of Nanda&#x27;s emperor with him. Secretly, however, Chanakya hatched a plan to get Vairodhaka killed. He knew that the chief architect of Pataliputra was a Rakshasa loyalist. He asked this architect to build a triumphal arch for Chandragupta&#x27;s procession to the imperial palace. He arranged the procession to be held at midnight citing astrological reasons, but actually to ensure poor visibility. He then invited Vairodhaka to lead the procession on Chandragupta&#x27;s elephant, and accompanied by Chandragupta&#x27;s bodyguards. As expected, Rakshasa&#x27;s loyalists arranged for the arch to fall on who they thought was Chandragupta. Vairodhaka was killed, and once again, the assassination was blamed on Rakshasa.

Malayaketu and Rakshasa then formed an alliance with five kings: Chiravarman of Kauluta (Kulu), Meghaksha of Parasika, Narasimha of Malaya, Pushkaraksha of Kashmira, and Sindhusena of Saindhava. This allied army also included soldiers from Chedi, Gandhara, Hunas, Khasa, Magadha, Shaka, and Yavana territories.

In Pataliputra, Chanakya&#x27;s agent informed him that three Rakshasa loyalists remained in the capital: the Jain monk Jiva-siddhi, the scribe Shakata-dasa and the jewellers&#x27; guild chief Chandana-dasa. Of these, Jiva-siddhi was actually a spy of Chanakya, unknown to his other spies. Chandana-dasa sheltered Rakshasa&#x27;s wife, who once unknowingly dropped her husband&#x27;s signet-ring (&quot;mudra&quot;). Chanakya&#x27;s agent got hold of this signet-ring, and brought it to Chanakya. Using this signet ring, Chanakya sent a letter to Malayaketu warning him that his allies were treacherous. Chanakya also asked some of Chandragupta&#x27;s princes to fake defection to Malayaketu&#x27;s camp. In addition, Chanakya ordered Shakata-dasa&#x27;s murder, but had him &#x27;rescued&#x27; by Siddharthaka, a spy pretending to be an agent of Chandana-dasa. Chanakya&#x27;s spy then took Shakata-dasa to Rakshasa.

When Shakata-dasa and his &#x27;rescuer&#x27; Siddharthaka reached Rakshasa, Siddharthaka presented him the signet-ring, claiming to have found it at Chandana-dasa&#x27;s home. As a reward, Rakshasa gave him some jewels that Malayaketu had gifted him. Sometime after this, another of Chanakya&#x27;s agents, disguised as a jeweller, sold Parvata&#x27;s jewels to Rakshasa.

Sometime later, Rakshasa sent his spies disguised as musicians to Chandragupta&#x27;s court. But Chanakya knew all about Rakshasa&#x27;s plans thanks to his spies. In front of Rakshasa&#x27;s spies, Chanakya and Chandragupta feigned an angry argument. Chandragupta pretended to dismiss Chanakya, and declared that Rakshasa would make a better minister. Meanwhile, Malayaketu had a conversation with Chanakya&#x27;s spy Bhagurayana while approaching Rakshasa&#x27;s house. Bhagurayana made Malayaketu distrustful of Rakshasa, by saying that Rakshasa hated only Chanakya, and would be willing to serve Nanda&#x27;s son Chandragupta. Shortly after this, a messenger came to Rakshasa&#x27;s house and informed him that Chandragupta had dismissed Chanakya while praising him. This convinced Malayaketu that Rakashasa could not be trusted.

Malayaketu then decided to invade Pataliputra without Rakshasa by his side. He consulted the Jain monk Jiva-siddhi to decide an auspicious time for beginning the march. Jiva-siddhi, a spy of Chanakya, told him that he could start immediately. Jiva-siddhi also convinced him that Rakshasa was responsible for his father&#x27;s death, but Bhagurayana persuaded him not to harm Rakshasa. Shortly after, Chanakya&#x27;s spy Siddharthaka pretended to get caught with a fake letter addressed to Chandragupta by Rakshasa. Wearing the jewels given by Rakshasa, he pretended to be an agent of Rakshasa. The letter, sealed with Rakshasa&#x27;s signet-ring, informed Chandragupta that Rakshasa only wished to replace Chanakya as the prime minister. It also stated that five of Malayaketu&#x27;s allies were willing to defect to Chandragupta in return for land and wealth. An angry Malayaketu summoned Rakshasa, who arrived wearing Parvata&#x27;s jewels that Chanakya&#x27;s agent had sold him. When Malayaketu saw Rakshasa wearing his father&#x27;s jewels, he was convinced that there was indeed a treacherous plan against him. He executed his five allies in a brutal manner.

The rest of Malayaketu&#x27;s allies deserted him, disgusted at his treatment of the five slayed allies. Rakshasa managed to escape, tracked by Chanakya&#x27;s spies. One of Chanakya&#x27;s spies, disguised as a friend of Chandana-dasa, got in touch with him. He told Rakshasa that Chandana-dasa was about to be executed for refusing to divulge the location of Rakshasa&#x27;s family. On hearing this, Rakshasa rushed to Pataliputra to surrender and save the life of his loyal friend Chandana-dasa. When he reached Pataliputra, Chanakya, pleased with his loyalty to Chandana-dasa, offered him clemency. Rakshasa pledged allegiance to Chandragupta and agreed to be his prime minister, in return for release of Chandana-dasa and a pardon for Malayaketu. Chanakya then bound his top knot, having achieved his objective, and retired.

== Legacy ==
Chanakya is regarded as a great thinker and diplomat in India. Many Indian nationalists regard him as one of the earliest people who envisioned a united India spanning the entire subcontinent. India&#x27;s former National Security Advisor Shiv Shankar Menon praised Chanakya&#x27;s Arthashastra for its precise and timeless descriptions of power. Furthermore, he recommended reading of the book for broadening the vision on strategic issues.

=== Identification with Kautilya, author of the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; ===


Traditionally, two books are attributed to Chanakya: &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, and &quot;Chanakya Niti&quot;, also known as &quot;Chanakya Neeti-shastra&quot;, a collection of aphorisms, said to be selected by Chanakya from the various shastras.

Early on, the attribution to Chanakya has been questioned, and contemporary scholarship since 1965 rejects this attribution to Chanakya, regarding the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; as a compilation of a number of earlier texts written by various authors, which were compiled in a new text around the beginning of the Common Era; this text then underwent a major redaction or expansion at the end of the first century CE or in the second century. Patrick Olivelle states that the oldest layer of text, the &quot;sources of the Kauṭilya&quot;, dates from the period 150 BCE–50 CE. The next phase of the work&#x27;s evolution, the &quot;Kauṭilya Recension&quot;, which compiled portions of these sources into a new &quot;shastra&quot;, can be dated to the period 50–125 CE. Finally, the &quot;Śāstric Redaction&quot; (i.e., the text as we have it today) is dated period 175–300 CE.

The &quot;Arthashastra&quot; identifies its author as Kauṭilya, a gotra or clan name, except for one verse that refers to him by the personal name of Vishnugupta. One of the earliest Sanskrit literatures to identify Chanakya with Vishnugupta explicitly was the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; (2nd c. CE). K. C. Ojha proposes that the traditional identification of Vishnugupta with Kauṭilya was caused by a confusion of the text&#x27;s editor and its originator. He suggests that Vishnugupta was a redactor of the original work of Kauṭilya. 

R. P. Kangle, writing in the 1960s, found the traditional attribution to the Maurya prime minister Chanakya acceptable, therefor dating the Arthashastra to Mauryan times. Critical scholarship after Kangle, such as Thomas Trautmann and Patrick Olivelle, following Thomas Burrow, reject this identification of Chanakya and Kautilya, as it is a later development from the Gupta period. Trautmann points out that none of the earlier sources that refer to Chanakya mention his authorship of the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, and Olivelle notes that &quot;the name Canakya, however, is completely absent from the text.&quot; The identification happens at the penultimate paragraph of the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, which states, &quot;without the explicit use of the name Canakya,&quot; that the treatise was authored by the person who rescued the country from the Nanda kings,&quot; that is, the Maurya prime minister Chanakya who played a pivotal role in the overthrow of the Nanda dynasty. 

The Guptas tried to present themselves symbolically as the legitimate successors of the Mauryas, even using the names &quot;Chandragupta&quot; and &quot;Gupta,&quot; a connection also made in the play &quot;Mudraraksasa&quot;, composed in the time of the Guptas. The verse seems to be a later interpolation, and Olivelle proposes that it was an attempt to identify the author of the political treatise, which was followed by the Guptas, with the renowned Maurya prime minister.

Several reasons are given for the persistent scholarly attribution to Chanakya, which from the beginning has been &quot;heavily influenced&quot; by this traditional attribution, and has led many scholars to an a priori dating to Mauryan times. One reason is the reception by Indian nationalists, who saw it &quot;as evidence of a pragmatic and virile tradition of self-rule in India’s past.&quot; According to Trautmann, &quot;[n]ationalist aspirations seemed somehow fortified when the existence of strongly centralized empires and native schools of political theory was shown.&quot; Furthermore, the identification with Kautilya provided &quot;a link to the most powerful dynasty in South Asian antiquity: the Mauryan Empire, and &quot;[g]iven the absolute paucity of sources for this most intriguing era, many scholars seem unable to resist using the Arthaśāstra as a source for the period, despite a decided lack of supporting evidence.&quot; According to McClish, &quot;the desire on the part of Indologists to possess just such a source seems to have exerted, in general, a strong influence on conclusions about the compositional history of the text.&quot;

Kautilya&#x27;s works were lost near the end of the Gupta Empire in the sixth century CE and not rediscovered until the early 20th century, when the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; was discovered in 1905 by librarian Rudrapatna Shamasastry in an uncatalogued group of ancient palm-leaf manuscripts donated by an unknown pandit to the Oriental Research Institute Mysore. It discusses monetary and fiscal policies, welfare, international relations, and war strategies in detail. The text also outlines the duties of a ruler. Kautilya uses different terms to describe war other than dharma-yuddha (just war), such as kutayudhha (unjust war).

Kautilya&#x27;s work is thought of as an important precursor to classical economics. and based on the identification of Kautilya with Chanakya, K.N. Jha considers Chanakya as the pioneer of the field of political science and economics in India, .

===Naming===
The diplomatic enclave in New Delhi is named Chanakyapuri in honour of Chanakya. Institutes named after him include Training Ship Chanakya, Chanakya National Law University and Chanakya Institute of Public Leadership. Chanakya circle in Mysore has been named after him.

=== In popular Culture ===

====Plays====
Several modern adaptations of the legend of Chanakya narrate his story in a semi-fictional form, extending these legends. In &quot;Chandragupta&quot; (1911), a play by Dwijendralal Ray, the Nanda king exiles his half-brother Chandragupta, who joins the army of Alexander the Great. Later, with help from Chanakya and Katyayan (the former Prime Minister of Magadha), Chandragupta defeats Nanda, who is put to death by Chanakya.

==== Film and television ====

<text>Batman Begins is a 2005 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Nolan and David S. Goyer. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, it stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, and Morgan Freeman in supporting roles. The film reboots the &quot;Batman&quot; film series, telling the origin story of Bruce Wayne from the death of his parents to his journey to become Batman and his fight to stop Ra&#x27;s al Ghul (Neeson) and the Scarecrow (Murphy) from plunging Gotham City into chaos.

After &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; was panned by critics and underperformed at the box office, Warner Bros. Pictures cancelled future &quot;Batman&quot; films, including Joel Schumacher&#x27;s planned &quot;Batman Unchained.&quot; Between 1998 and 2003, several filmmakers collaborated with Warner Bros. in attempting to reboot the franchise. After the studio rejected a &quot;Batman&quot; origin story reboot Joss Whedon pitched in December 2002, Warner Bros. hired Nolan in January 2003 to direct a new film. Nolan and Goyer began development on the film in early 2003. Aiming for a darker, more realistic tone compared to the previous films, a primary goal for their vision was to engage the audience&#x27;s emotional investment in both the Batman and Bruce Wayne identities of the lead character. The film, which was principally shot in the United Kingdom, Iceland and Chicago, relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects, with computer-generated imagery being used in a minimal capacity compared to other action films. Comic book storylines such as &quot;The Man Who Falls&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot; served as inspiration.

Expectations for &quot;Batman Begins&quot; ranged from moderate to low, which originated from the poor reception of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; that was credited with stalling the &quot;Batman&quot; film series in 1997. After premiering in Tokyo on May 31, 2005, the film was released on June 15, 2005. It received positive reviews from critics, who deemed the film an improvement over the Burton/Schumacher films. The film grossed over $371.9 million worldwide, becoming the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2005 and was the second highest grossing &quot;Batman&quot; film at the time behind Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; (1989). Receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, the film elevated Bale to leading man status while it made Nolan a high-profile director.

Since its release, &quot;Batman Begins&quot; has often been cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000s. It was credited for revitalizing the Batman character in popular culture, shifting its tone towards a darker and more serious tone and style. The film helped popularise the term reboot in Hollywood, inspiring studios and filmmakers to revive franchises with realistic and serious tones. It was followed by &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), with the three films constituting &quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot;.

==Plot==

In Gotham City, after falling down a well and getting swarmed by bats, a young Bruce Wayne develops a fear of them. At the opera with his parents, Bruce becomes unsettled by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger Joe Chill murders Bruce&#x27;s parents in front of him. Bruce is raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth.

Fourteen years later, Chill testifies against the mafia crime boss, Carmine Falcone, and is paroled. Bruce intends to murder Chill to avenge his parents, but one of Falcone&#x27;s hitmen does so first. Bruce&#x27;s childhood friend, Rachel Dawes, berates him for acting outside the justice system. After confronting Falcone, who says real power comes from being feared, Bruce spends the next seven years traveling the world, training in combat, and immersing himself in the criminal underworld.

In a Bhutan prison, he is approached by Henri Ducard, who recruits him to the League of Shadows, led by Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. The League believes Gotham is beyond saving and intends to destroy it. After completing his training, Bruce rejects the League and its mandate that killing is necessary. He escapes, burning down their temple in the process. Ra&#x27;s is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard. Intent on fighting crime, Bruce returns to Gotham and takes an interest in his family&#x27;s company, Wayne Enterprises, which is being taken public by businessman William Earle. Company archivist Lucius Fox, a friend of Bruce&#x27;s father, allows him access to prototype defense technologies, including a protective bodysuit and the Tumbler, an armored vehicle. Bruce poses publicly as a shallow playboy while setting up a base in the caves beneath Wayne Manor and taking up the vigilante identity of &quot;Batman,&quot; inspired by his childhood fear, which he has now conquered.

Intercepting a drug shipment, Batman provides Rachel, now a Gotham Assistant District Attorney, with evidence against Falcone and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, one of Gotham&#x27;s few honest police officers, to arrest him. In prison, Falcone meets Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychologist who smuggled drugs into Gotham with his help. Donning a scarecrow mask, Crane sprays Falcone with a fear-inducing hallucinogen, driving him insane and transferring him to Arkham Asylum. While investigating Crane, Batman is ambushed by him and sprayed with the hallucinogen. Batman barely escapes and is saved by Alfred and Fox, who develop an antidote for the hallucinogen.

When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, he reveals he has introduced his drug into Gotham&#x27;s water supply and drugs her with the hallucinogen. Batman later subdues Crane and sprays him with his own chemical. While being interrogated, Crane claims to work for Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety and administers the antidote. He gives her two vials: one for Gordon and the other for mass production. At Bruce&#x27;s birthday party, Ducard reappears and reveals himself to be the true Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham&#x27;s water supply, rendering Crane&#x27;s drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him. Ra&#x27;s loads the emitter onto Gotham&#x27;s monorail train to release the drug at the city&#x27;s central water source. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and reveals his identity to her. He confronts Ra&#x27;s on the train as Gordon uses the Tumbler&#x27;s cannons to destroy a section of the track. Batman escapes the train and leaves Ra&#x27;s to die as it crashes.

Bruce gains Rachel&#x27;s respect. However, she refuses to be with him, promising they can be together when Gotham no longer needs Batman. Batman becomes a public hero. After purchasing a controlling stake in Wayne Enterprises, Bruce fires Earle and replaces him with Fox. Sergeant Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant, shows Batman the Bat-Signal, and tells him about a criminal who leaves behind Joker playing cards. Batman promises to look into it and disappears into the night.

==Cast==
* Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman:A billionaire socialite who, after witnessing his parents&#x27; death in a mugging at age 8, travels around the world seven years before returning home to inherit his family company Wayne Enterprises whilst operating at night as a bat-masked vigilante bringing justice upon the criminal underworld of Gotham City. Bale was relatively unknown when cast. Before he was confirmed on September 11, 2003, having expressed interest in the role since Darren Aronofsky was planning his own film adaptation, Eion Bailey, Henry Cavill who later be cast as Superman, Billy Crudup, Hugh Dancy, Jake Gyllenhaal, Joshua Jackson, David Boreanaz, Heath Ledger, who later played the Joker in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, and Cillian Murphy, who would later be cast as Dr. Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow, took interest in it as well. Josh Hartnett met with Nolan about the role, but decided against pursuing it. Bale, Bailey and Murphy auditioned using the &quot;Batman Forever&quot; sonar suit donated by Val Kilmer, but the cape was lost, and Amy Adams served as the casting reader for the casting of Bruce Wayne / Batman in a favor to the casting director. Bale felt the previous films underused Batman&#x27;s character, overplaying the villains instead. To best pose as Batman, Bale studied graphic novels and illustrations of the superhero. Director Nolan said of Bale, &quot;He has exactly the balance of darkness and light that we were looking for.&quot; Goyer stated that while some actors could play a great Bruce Wayne or a great Batman, Bale could portray both radically different personalities. Since he had lost a great deal of weight in preparation for his role in &quot;The Machinist&quot;, Bale hired a personal trainer to help him gain of muscle in the span of only a couple of months to help him physically prepare for the role. After realizing he went over by , he lost the excess weight by the time filming began. Bale trained in Wing Chun Kung Fu under Eric Oram in preparation for the movie.
** Gus Lewis as Young Bruce Wayne.
* Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth:A trusted butler to Bruce&#x27;s parents, who continues his loyal service to their son after their deaths as his closest confidant. Nolan offered the role to Anthony Hopkins but he declined. Nolan went to Caine&#x27;s country home to personally deliver him the script, telling what his role would be and describing Alfred as &quot;Batman&#x27;s godfather&quot;. Nolan felt Caine would effectively portray the foster father element of the character. Although Alfred is depicted in the film as having served the Wayne family for generations, Caine created his own backstory, in that before becoming Wayne&#x27;s butler, Alfred served in the Special Air Service. After being wounded, he was invited to the position of the Wayne family butler by Thomas Wayne because, &quot;He wanted a butler, but someone a bit tougher than that, you know?&quot;
* Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard / Ra&#x27;s al Ghul: The leader of the League of Shadows, an ancient society that uses chaos to punish the corrupt and decadent, who goes undercover as an associate of the League and trains Bruce in martial arts, later revealing himself in the film&#x27;s climax. Writer David Goyer said he felt he was the most complex of all the Batman villains, comparing him to Osama bin Laden; &quot;He&#x27;s not crazy in the way that all the other Batman villains are. He&#x27;s not bent on revenge; he&#x27;s actually trying to heal the world. He&#x27;s just doing it by very draconian means.&quot; Gary Oldman was first choice for the part, but ended up playing James Gordon instead. Guy Pearce, who collaborated with Christopher Nolan on &quot;Memento&quot; (2000), reported that the pair had discussions about him playing the role, but both of them decided that he was too young for the part. Viggo Mortensen was also considered for the role. Neeson is commonly cast as a mentor, so the revelation that his character was the main villain was intended to shock viewers.
* Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes: Bruce&#x27;s childhood friend and love interest who serves as Gotham City&#x27;s assistant district attorney and fights against corruption in the city of Gotham. Nolan found a &quot;tremendous warmth and great emotional appeal&quot; in Holmes, and also felt &quot;she has a maturity beyond her years that comes across in the film and is essential to the idea that Rachel is something of a moral conscience for Bruce&quot;.
** Emma Lockhart as Young Rachel Dawes.
* Gary Oldman as James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon:One of the few uncorrupted Gotham City police officers, who is on duty the night of the murder of Bruce&#x27;s parents and, in this way, shares a special bond with the adult Bruce and thus with Batman. Oldman was Nolan&#x27;s first choice for Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, but when Chris Cooper turned down the part of Gordon to spend time with his family Nolan decided that it would be refreshing for Oldman, who is renowned for his portrayals of villains, to play the role instead. &quot;I embody the themes of the movie which are the values of family, courage and compassion and a sense of right and wrong, good and bad and justice,&quot; Oldman said of his character. He filmed most of his scenes in Britain. Goyer said Oldman heavily resembled Gordon as drawn by David Mazzucchelli in &quot;&quot;.
* Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow: A corrupt psychopharmacologist working as Chief Administrator of Arkham Asylum. A specialist in the psychology of fear, he has secretly created a fear-inducing toxin and plots with Ra&#x27;s al Ghul to expose the entire Gotham population. Nolan decided against casting an Irish actor like Murphy for Batman, before casting him as Scarecrow. Murphy read numerous comics featuring the Scarecrow and discussed making the character look less theatrical with Nolan. Murphy explained, &quot;I wanted to avoid the Worzel Gummidge look, because he&#x27;s not a very physically imposing man – he&#x27;s more interested in the manipulation of the mind and what that can do.&quot; Robert Downey Jr. was considered for the role.
* Tom Wilkinson as Carmine Falcone:The most powerful Mafia boss in Gotham, who shares a prison cell with Joe Chill after he murdered Bruce&#x27;s parents. Later, after having Chill murdered for his decision to testify against their relationship, he goes into business with Dr. Jonathan Crane and Ra&#x27;s al Ghul by smuggling in Crane&#x27;s fear toxins through his drug shipments over the course of several months so that they can be mixed in with the city&#x27;s water supply.
* Rutger Hauer as William Earle:The CEO of Wayne Enterprises, who takes the company public in Bruce&#x27;s long-term absence.
* Ken Watanabe as decoy Ra&#x27;s al Ghul:A member of the League of Shadows assigned to impersonate Ra&#x27;s al Ghul during Bruce&#x27;s training.
* Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox:A high-ranking Wayne Enterprises employee demoted to working in the company&#x27;s Applied Science Division, where he conducts advanced studies in biochemistry and mechanical engineering and supplies Bruce with much of the gear necessary to carry out Batman&#x27;s mission. He is promoted to CEO when Bruce takes control of the company by the end of the film.
Other cast members include Mark Boone Junior as Arnold Flass, Gordon&#x27;s corrupt partner; Linus Roache as Thomas Wayne, Bruce&#x27;s late father; Larry Holden as district attorney Carl Finch; Colin McFarlane as Gillian B. Loeb, the police commissioner; Christine Adams as Jessica, William Earle&#x27;s secretary; Vincent Wong as an old Asian prisoner; Sara Stewart as Martha Wayne, Bruce&#x27;s late mother; Richard Brake as Joe Chill, the Waynes&#x27; killer; Gerard Murphy as the corrupt High Court Judge Faden; Charles Edwards as a Wayne Enterprises executive; Tim Booth as Victor Zsasz; Rade Šerbedžija as a homeless man, who is the last person to meet Bruce when he leaves Gotham City, and the first civilian to see Batman, Risteárd Cooper and Andrew Pleavin as uniformed policemen, Jo Martin as a police prison official, and Shane Rimmer and Jeremy Theobald (the star and co-producer of Nolan&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;Following&quot;) as Gotham Water Board technicians. Jack Gleeson, who had previously co-starred with Bale in 2002&#x27;s &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; and later found fame for his role as Joffrey Baratheon in the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, appears as a young admirer of Batman who is later saved by him from Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s men; Gleeson was cast at Bale&#x27;s recommendation. Actors John Foo, Joey Ansah, Spencer Wilding, Dave Legeno, Khan Bonfils, Mark Strange, Grant Guirey, Rodney Ryan and Dean Alexandrou portray members of the League of Shadows. Hayden Nickel made his acting debut portraying James Gordon Jr..

==Production==
===Development===
In January 2003, Warner Bros. hired &quot;Memento&quot; director Christopher Nolan to direct an untitled &quot;Batman&quot; film, and David S. Goyer signed on to write the script two months later. Nolan stated his intention to reinvent the film franchise of &quot;Batman&quot; by &quot;doing the origins story of the character, which is a story that&#x27;s never been told before&quot;. Nolan said that humanity and realism would be the basis of the origin film, and that &quot;the world of Batman is that of grounded reality. [It] will be a recognizable, contemporary reality against which an extraordinary heroic figure arises.&quot; Goyer said that the goal of the film was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Nolan felt the previous films were exercises in style rather than drama, and described his inspiration as being Richard Donner&#x27;s 1978 film &quot;Superman&quot;, in its focus on depicting the character&#x27;s growth. Also similar to &quot;Superman&quot;, Nolan wanted an all-star supporting cast for &quot;Batman Begins&quot; to lend a more epic feel and credibility to the story.

Goyer wanted to reboot the franchise; he and Nolan saw Batman as a romantic character, and Nolan envisioned a large, sweeping film like &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. Although Warner Bros. required the film not be R-rated, Nolan did not have a problem with this, as he wanted to make the film that he wanted to see when he was 11 years old. His personal &quot;jumping off point&quot; of inspiration was &quot;The Man Who Falls&quot;, a short story by Denny O&#x27;Neil and Dick Giordano about Bruce&#x27;s travels throughout the world. The early scene in &quot;Batman Begins&quot; of young Bruce Wayne falling into a well was adapted from &quot;The Man Who Falls&quot;. &quot;&quot;, written by Jeph Loeb and drawn by Tim Sale, influenced Goyer in writing the screenplay, with the villain Carmine Falcone as one of many elements which were drawn from &quot;Halloween&quot;″s &quot;sober, serious approach&quot;. The writers considered having Harvey Dent in the film, but replaced him with the new character Rachel Dawes when they realized they &quot;couldn&#x27;t do him justice&quot;. The character was later portrayed by Aaron Eckhart in the 2008 sequel &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. The sequel to &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;&quot;, also served as a minor influence. Goyer used the vacancy of Bruce Wayne&#x27;s multi-year absence presented in &quot;&quot; to help set up some of the film&#x27;s events in the transpiring years. In addition, the film&#x27;s Sergeant James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon was based on his comic book incarnation as seen in &quot;Year One&quot;. The writers of &quot;Batman Begins&quot; also used Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;Year One&quot; plot device, which was about a corrupt police force that led to Gordon and Gotham City&#x27;s need for Batman. Due to Batman&#x27;s extensive rogues gallery over seventy years, Goyer and Nolan decided to use the Scarecrow and Ra&#x27;s al Ghul as the film&#x27;s villains, as both characters had not been featured in previous &quot;Batman&quot; films nor in Adam West&#x27;s 1960s television series.

A common idea in the comics is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan explained that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman&#x27;s first appearances – it emphasized the importance of bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne&#x27;s reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.

===Filming===

As with all his films, Nolan refused a second unit; he did this in order to keep his vision consistent. Filming began in March 2004 in the Vatnajökull glacier in Iceland (standing in for Bhutan). The crew built a village and the front doors to Ra&#x27;s&#x27; temple, as well as a road to access the remote area. The weather was problematic, with winds, rain, and a lack of snow. A shot that cinematographer Wally Pfister had planned to take using a crane had to be completed with a handheld camera.

Unlike Burton and Schumacher&#x27;s Gotham City that did not exist in the real world, Nolan shot exteriors in London, New York, and Chicago as he wanted the city to seem recognizable. In seeking inspiration from &quot;Superman&quot; and other blockbuster films of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Nolan based most of the production in England, specifically Shepperton Studios. A Batcave set was built there and measured long, wide, and high. Production designer Nathan Crowley installed twelve pumps to create a waterfall with , and built rocks using molds of real caves. An airship hangar at Cardington, Bedfordshire was rented by Warner Bros. during April 2004 and, converted into a sound stage, was where the slum-district of &quot;the Narrows&quot; and the feet of the monorails were filmed.
Mentmore Towers was chosen from twenty different locations for Wayne Manor, as Nolan and Crowley liked its white floors, which gave the impression of the manor as a memorial to Wayne&#x27;s parents. The building chosen to represent Arkham Asylum was the National Institute for Medical Research building in Mill Hill, northwest London, England. The St Pancras railway station and the Abbey Mills Pumping Stations were used for Arkham&#x27;s interiors. The Senate House of University College London was used for courtrooms. Some scenes, including the Tumbler pursuit, were filmed in Chicago at locations such as Lower Wacker Drive and 35 East Wacker. Authorities agreed to raise Franklin Street Bridge for a scene where access to the Narrows is closed.

Despite the film&#x27;s darkness, Nolan wanted to make the film appeal to a wide age range. &quot;Not the youngest kids obviously, I think what we&#x27;ve done is probably a bit intense for them but I certainly didn&#x27;t want to exclude the sort of ten to 12-year olds, because as a kid I would have loved to have seen a movie like this.&quot; Because of this, nothing gory or bloody was filmed.

===Music===

The score for &quot;Batman Begins&quot; was composed by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. Nolan originally invited Zimmer to compose the music, and Zimmer asked Nolan if he could invite Howard to compose as well, as they had always planned a collaboration. The two composers collaborated on separate themes for the &quot;split personality&quot; of Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Batman. Zimmer and Howard began composing in Los Angeles and moved to London where they stayed for twelve weeks to complete most of their writing. Zimmer and Howard sought inspiration for shaping the score by visiting the &quot;Batman Begins&quot; sets.

Zimmer wanted to avoid writing music that had been done in earlier &quot;Batman&quot; films, so the score became an amalgamation of orchestra and electronic music. The film&#x27;s ninety-piece orchestra was developed from members of various London orchestras, and Zimmer chose to use more than the normal number of cellos. Zimmer enlisted a boy soprano to help reflect the music in some of the film&#x27;s scenes where tragic memories of Bruce Wayne&#x27;s parents are involved. &quot;He&#x27;s singing a fairly pretty tune and then he gets stuck, it&#x27;s like froze, arrested development,&quot; said Zimmer. He also attempted to add a human dimension to Batman, whose behavior would typically be seen as &quot;psychotic&quot;, through the music. Both composers collaborated to create 2 hours and 20 minutes worth of music for the film, with Zimmer composing the action sequences and Howard focusing on the dramatic scenes.

==Special effects and design==

===Design===
Nolan used the 1982 science fiction film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; as a source of inspiration for &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. He screened &quot;Blade Runner&quot; to Pfister and two others to show the attitude and style that he wanted to draw from the film. Nolan described the film&#x27;s world as &quot;an interesting lesson on the technique of exploring and describing a credible universe that doesn&#x27;t appear to have any boundaries&quot;, a lesson that he applied to the production of &quot;Batman Begins&quot;.

Nolan worked with production designer Nathan Crowley to create the look of Gotham City. Crowley built a model of the city that filled Nolan&#x27;s garage. Crowley and Nolan designed it as a large, modern metropolitan area that would reflect the various periods of architecture that the city had gone through. Elements were drawn from New York City, Chicago, and Tokyo; the latter for its elevated freeways and monorails. The Narrows was based on the slummish nature of the (now demolished) walled city of Kowloon in Hong Kong.

===Tumbler===
Crowley started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by model bashing. Crowley used the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model to serve as the chassis for the Tumbler&#x27;s turbine engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.

The styrofoam model was used to create a steel &quot;test frame&quot;, which had to stand up to several standards: have a speed of over , go from 0 to in 5 seconds, possess a steering system to make sharp turns at city corners, and withstand a self-propelled launch of up to . On the first jump test, the Tumbler&#x27;s front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt. The basic configuration of the newly designed Tumbler included a 5.7-liter Chevy V8 engine, a truck axle for the rear axle, front tires by Hoosier (which are actually dirt racing tires used on the right rear of open wheel sprint cars), 4 rear 44/18.5-16.5 Interco Super Swamper TSL tires (44&quot; tall, 18.5&quot; wide, mounted on a 16.5&quot; wheel) and the suspension system of Baja racing trucks. The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars.

With the design process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle possessing 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks. The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film&#x27;s scenes.

The interior of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a miniature model that was 1:6 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual Tumbler was used for the waterfall sequence.

===Batsuit===
The filmmakers intended to create a very mobile Batsuit that would allow the wearer to move easily to fight and crouch. Previous film incarnations of the Batsuit had been stiff and especially restrictive of full head movement. Costume designer Lindy Hemming and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed &quot;Cape Town&quot;, a secured compound located at Shepperton Studios in London. The Batsuit&#x27;s basic design was a neoprene undersuit, which was shaped by attaching molded cream latex sections. Christian Bale was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast. To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay, plastiline was used to smooth the surface. In addition, the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible, light, durable, and black. The latter presented a problem, since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam&#x27;s durability.

For the cape, director Christopher Nolan wanted to have a &quot;flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels&quot;. Hemming&#x27;s team created the cape out of their own version of parachute nylon that had electrostatic flocking, a process shared with the team by the British Ministry of Defence. The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection. The cape was topped by a cowl, which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard. The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit. Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show &quot;a man who has angst&quot;, so his character would be revealed through the mask.

===Fight choreography===

Fight choreographers for &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, Justo Dieguez and Andy Norman, trained actors and stunt performers using the Spanish &quot;Keysi Fighting Method&quot;, which gained fame after it was used in the film and its sequel, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;; however, the method was modified in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; due to Batman&#x27;s age and physical condition and in order to match Bale&#x27;s fighting style. The method is a self-defense system whose training is based on the study and cultivation of natural instincts.

===Visual effects===
For &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, Nolan preferred traditional stuntwork over computer-generated imagery. Scale models were used to represent the Narrows and Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s temple. There were, however, several establishing shots that were CG composite images, such as Gotham&#x27;s skyline, exterior shots of Wayne Tower, and some of the exterior monorail shots. The climactic monorail sequence mixed live action footage, model work, and CGI. The bats depicted in the film were entirely digital (except in shots containing only one or two bats), as it was decided that directing large numbers of real bats on-set would be problematic; dead bats were scanned to create digital models. Locations and sets were recreated digitally so that the flying bats would not appear incongruous once incorporated into the finished film.

=== Context ===
2005 was expected by industry experts to underperform compared to 2004. Many attributed the slump to be a result of high ticket prices, marketing costs, DVD sales hitting record levels, and new technologies creating an incipient demand for movies delivered directly via the Internet, over-the-airwaves, satellite dish or cable set-top box. By the start of the theatrical summer in 2005 (May), the box office slumped for 11 consecutive weeks, with year-to-date ticket sales down 5.4 percent from last year even as ticket prices rose a moderate 3 percent, to around $6.40 on average, according to Exhibitor Relations. Theater attendance prior to the summer of 2005 declined about 8 percent.

Several films were projected to not only perform well at the box office, but also reverse the slump at the box office. &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; was expected by the industry to be the top-grossing film of the summer due to being the final live action &quot;Star Wars&quot; film at the time. Other films that were expected to do well were &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, &quot;Madagascar&quot;, &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, and &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.

&quot;Batman Begins&quot; was expected by industry experts to help reverse the box office slump in June. However, there were concerns over a possible soft opening for the film. The previous film, &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, was widely panned by critics and was credited with stalling the franchise since 1997. Bale&#x27;s lack of star power at the time and a lack of iconic villains such as the Joker and Penguin that were portrayed by A-list celebrities were seen as possible detachments from audiences. Some also expressed concerns that Holmes&#x27; involvement with the film could derail the film&#x27;s financial prospect due to her high-profile relationship with Tom Cruise (whose film &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; opened the following weekend) after his controversial appearance on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show.&quot;

=== Theatrical ===

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Batman Begins&quot; ranked at the top in its opening weekend, accumulating $48 million, which was seen as &quot;strong but unimpressive by today&#x27;s instantaneous blockbuster standards&quot;. The film&#x27;s five-day gross was $72.9 million, beating &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995) as the franchise high. &quot;Batman Begins&quot; also broke the five-day opening record in the 55 IMAX theaters, grossing $3.16 million. Polled moviegoers rated the film with an A, and according to the studio&#x27;s surveys, &quot;Batman Begins&quot; was considered the best of all the &quot;Batman&quot; films. The audience&#x27;s demographic was 57 percent male and 54 percent people over the age of 25.

The film held its top spot for another weekend, accumulating $28 million in a 43 percent drop from its first weekend. &quot;Batman Begins&quot; went on to gross $205 million in North America and had a worldwide total of $371.8 million from its original release. It earned $1.6 million more from its 2012 re-release, bringing its lifetime worldwide total to $373.4 million. It is the fourth-highest-grossing &quot;Batman&quot; film, , behind Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;, which grossed $411 million worldwide and also being surpassed by its sequels &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, both of which have grossed over $1 billion. &quot;Batman Begins&quot; averaged $12,634 per theater in its opening weekend. It was released in more theaters, but sold fewer tickets than the other previous &quot;Batman&quot; movies, with the exception of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. &quot;Batman Begins&quot; was the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2005 in the United States.

===Critical response===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives &quot;Batman Begins&quot; an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Brooding and dark, but also exciting and smart, &quot;Batman Begins&quot; is a film that understands the essence of one of the definitive superheroes.&quot; At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating reviews, the film received an average score of 70 out of 100, based on 41 critics, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

James Berardinelli applauded Nolan and Goyer&#x27;s work in creating more understanding into &quot;who [Batman] is and what motivates him&quot;, something Berardinelli felt Tim Burton&#x27;s film had lacked; at the same time, Berardinelli felt the romantic aspect between Bale and Holmes did not work because the actors lacked the chemistry Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder (&quot;Superman&quot;), or Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst (&quot;Spider-Man&quot;) shared in their respective roles. According to &quot;Total Film&quot;, Nolan manages to create such strong characters and story that the third-act action sequences cannot compare to &quot;the frisson of two people talking&quot;, and Katie Holmes and Christian Bale&#x27;s romantic subplot has a spark &quot;refreshingly free of Peter Parker/Mary Jane-style whining&quot;.

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Kenneth Turan, who felt the film began slowly, stated that the &quot;story, psychology and reality, not special effects&quot;, assisted the darkness behind Batman&#x27;s arsenal; he noted that Neeson and Holmes, unlike Bale&#x27;s ability to &quot;feel his role in his bones&quot;, do not appear to fit their respective characters in &quot;being both comic-book archetypes and real people&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s David Denby did not share Berardinelli and Turan&#x27;s opinion. He was unimpressed with the film, when comparing it to the two Tim Burton films, and that Christian Bale&#x27;s presence was hindered by the &quot;dull earnestness of the screenplay&quot;, the final climax was &quot;cheesy and unexciting&quot;, and that Nolan had resorted to imitating the &quot;fakery&quot; used by other filmmakers when filming action sequences.

Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; believed Nolan and Goyer managed to &quot;comfortably mix the tormented drama and revenge motifs with light hearted gags and comic book allusions,&quot; and that Nolan takes the series out of the &quot;slam-bang Hollywood jokefests&quot; the franchise had drifted into. Comic book scribe and editor Dennis O&#x27;Neil stated that he &quot;felt the filmmakers really understood the character they were translating&quot;, citing this film as the best of the live-action &quot;Batman&quot; films. In contrast, J. R. Jones, from the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, criticized the script, and Nolan and David Goyer for not living up to the &quot;hype about exploring Batman&#x27;s damaged psyche&quot;. Roger Ebert, who gave mixed reviews to the previous films, and claimed in his review for &quot;Batman Returns&quot; that he did not believe noir worked in superhero films, wrote this was &quot;the &quot;Batman&quot; movie I&#x27;ve been waiting for; more correctly, this is the movie I did not realize I was waiting for&quot;. Giving it four out of four stars, he commended the realistic portrayals of the Batman arsenal – the Batsuit, Batcave, Tumbler, and the Batsignal – as well as the focus on &quot;the story and character&quot; with less stress on &quot;high-tech action&quot;.

Like Berardinelli, &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Mike Clark thought Bale performed the role of Batman as well as he did Patrick Bateman in &quot;American Psycho&quot;, but that the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes was &quot;frustratingly underdeveloped&quot;. Kyle Smith thought Bale exhibited &quot;both the menace and the wit he showed in his brilliant turn in &quot;American Psycho&quot;&quot;, and that the film works so well because of the realism, stating, &quot;Batman starts stripping away each layer of Gotham crime only to discover a sicker and more monstrous evil beneath, his rancid city simultaneously invokes early &#x27;90s New York, when criminals frolicked to the tune of five murders a day; &quot;Serpico&quot; New York, when cops were for sale; and today, when psychos seek to kill us all at once rather than one by one.&quot; In contrast, Salon.com&#x27;s Stephanie Zacharek felt Nolan did not deliver the emotional depth expected of &quot;one of the most soulful and tortured superheroes of all&quot;; she thought Bale, unlike Michael Keaton who she compared him to, failed to connect with the audience underneath the mask, but that Gary Oldman succeeded in &quot;emotional complexity&quot; where the rest of the movie failed.

Film director Tim Burton—who had directed the 1989 Batman film and its first sequel—felt Nolan &quot;captured the real spirit that these kind of movies are supposed to have nowadays. When I did &quot;Batman&quot; twenty years ago, in 1988 or something, it was a different time in comic book movies. You couldn&#x27;t go into that dark side of comics yet. The last couple of years that has become acceptable and Nolan certainly got more to the root of what the &quot;Batman&quot; comics are about.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Impact==
&quot;Batman Begins&quot; has been cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000s. On the film&#x27;s 10th anniversary, &quot;Forbes&quot; published an article describing its lasting influence: &quot;Reboot became part of our modern vocabulary, and superhero origin stories became increasingly envogue for the genre. The phrase &quot;dark and gritty&quot; likewise joined the cinematic lexicon, influencing our perception of different approaches to storytelling not only in the comic book film genre but in all sorts of other genres as well.&quot; Shawn Adler of MTV stated &quot;Batman Begins&quot; heralded a trend of darker genre films, that either retold back-stories or rebooted them altogether. Examples he cited were &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, as well as the in-development &quot;RoboCop&quot;, &quot;Red Sonja&quot;, and &quot;Grayskull&quot;. In 2012, Kevin Feige, film producer and president of Marvel Studios, stated, &quot;Chris Nolan&#x27;s Batman is the greatest thing that happened [to superhero films] because it bolstered everything.&quot; Filmmakers, screenwriters and producers who have mentioned &quot;Batman Begins&quot; or &quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot; to describe their projects include:

==Themes==
Comic book writer and author Danny Fingeroth argues that a strong theme in the film is Bruce&#x27;s search for a father figure, saying &quot;[Alfred] is the good father that Bruce comes to depend on. Bruce&#x27;s real father died before they could establish an adult relationship, and Liam Neeson&#x27;s Ducard is stern and demanding, didactic and challenging, but not a father figure with any sympathy. If Bruce is anyone&#x27;s son, he is Alfred&#x27;s. [Morgan] Freeman&#x27;s Lucius is cool and imperturbable, another steady anchor in Bruce&#x27;s life.&quot; Blogger Mark Fisher states that Bruce&#x27;s search for justice requires him to learn from a proper father figure, with Thomas Wayne and Ra&#x27;s al Ghul being the two counterpoints. Alfred provides a maternal figure of unconditional love, despite the overall lack of focus on a mother figure in Bruce&#x27;s life.

Fingeroth also argues that a major theme in the film is fear, which supports the story of Bruce Wayne becoming a hero. Director Christopher Nolan stated that the idea behind the film was &quot;a person who would confront his innermost fear and then attempt to become it&quot;. Fingeroth referred to this film&#x27;s depiction as &quot;the man with fear—but who rises above it&quot;. The theme of fear is further personified by the Scarecrow. The film depicts how fear can affect all creatures regardless of might. Allusions to fear are seen throughout, from Bruce&#x27;s conquering of his demons, to becoming Batman, to the Scarecrow and his deadly fear toxin. The macabre, distorted images presented in the Scarecrow&#x27;s toxin-induced hallucinations also express the idea of terror to an extreme.
Critic Brian Orndorf considered &quot;Batman Begins&quot; &quot;fierce&quot; and &quot;demonstrative in brood&quot;, giving the film an abundance of gravitas and energy. It strays away from the lighter fare of Joel Schumacher&#x27;s 1997 Batman film, &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, which contained camp one-liners throughout. The theme of fear is intensified with the help of the musical score by Zimmer and Howard, which also &quot;eschews traditional heroic themes&quot;. Also contrary to previous &quot;Batman&quot; films, a psychological investigation of Bruce Wayne&#x27;s split personality in the bat suit is only lightly touched upon. Orndorf noted that Bruce is a &quot;character constantly striving to do the right thing, not worn down by incessant reexamination&quot;.

<text>Samuel Ruben (born Charles Rubenstein; November 5, 1913 – September 28, 1943) was an American chemist who with Martin Kamen co-discovered the synthesis of the isotope carbon-14 in 1940.

==Early life==
Ruben was the son of Herschel and Frieda Penn Rubenstein – the name was officially shortened to Ruben in 1930. Young Sam developed a friendship with neighbor Jack Dempsey and became involved with a local boys&#x27; boxing club and later, when the family moved across the Bay to Berkeley, he was a successful basketball player at Berkeley High School (Berkeley, California). After achieving his B.S. in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, he continued his studies there and was awarded a Ph.D. in physical chemistry in May 1938. He was immediately appointed instructor in the chemistry department, and became an assistant professor in 1941.

==Research==
Ruben and colleague Martin Kamen, a University of Chicago Ph.D. and researcher in chemistry and nuclear physics working under Ernest O. Lawrence at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, set out to elucidate the path of carbon in photosynthesis by incorporating the short-lived radioactive isotope carbon-11 () in their many experiments between 1938 and 1942. Aided by the concepts and collaboration of C. B. van Niel, at Stanford University&#x27;s Hopkins Marine Station, it became clear to them that reduction of CO can occur in the dark and may involve processes similar to bacterial systems. This interpretation challenged the century-old Adolf von Baeyer theory of photochemical reduction of CO adsorbed on chlorophyll which had guided decades of effort by Richard Willstätter, Arthur Stoll, and many others in vain searches for formaldehyde.

In hundreds of experiments with carbon-11 produced from deuterons and boron-10 by Kamen in the Radiation Laboratory&#x27;s 37-inch cyclotron, Ruben and Kamen, with collaborators from botany, microbiology, physiology and organic chemistry, pursued the path of carbon dioxide in plants, algae, and bacteria. Their results, confused by absorption of the products on proteinaceous residues, initially failed to reveal the path of carbon in photosynthesis but succeeded in exciting the interest of scientists worldwide in the search and revelation of metabolic processes, beginning a revolution in biochemistry and medicine.

Ruben&#x27;s experiments using &#x27;heavy water&#x27;, , to yield gas had shown that the oxygen gas produced in photosynthesis comes from water. With nuclear physicists&#x27; tenuous prediction of a &quot;long-lived radioactive carbon isotope&quot;, Ruben and Kamen pursued several routes that could lead to identification of the carbon-14 isotope. After several failed attempts, Kamen collected the results of a 120-hour cyclotron bombardment of graphite and trudged in the rain with it to the &quot;Rat House&quot;, adjacent both to the chemistry department and to the cyclotron, and Ruben&#x27;s desk. At 8 am, February 27, 1940, Ruben demonstrated unequivocally that the radioactivity was from carbon-14.

Use of carbon-14 in tracer experiments was hindered by the difficulty measuring the weak beta emission of the radioactive decay and by the onset of World War II that shut off production of the isotope. In 1942 Ruben was assigned to work on war related research away from Berkeley. Further, Kamen was removed from his position at Berkeley due to allegations he was a security risk. Ruben fully realized the potential use of this isotope and was committed to working to elucidate the mechanism of photosynthetic carbon fixation using carbon-14. Instead, Ruben gave all his barium carbonate-C to chemistry department faculty member Andrew Benson who began his long series of fixation experiments to determine the path of carbon in photosynthesis. Only in 1949 did chemist Willard Libby use it to invent radiocarbon dating.

Ruben&#x27;s recruitment for research in the World War II wartime effort led him to interest in the mechanism of phosgene as a poisonous gas. With C-11 phosgene () prepared by Benson, they studied the combination of phosgene with lung proteins. Following Benson&#x27;s departure from Berkeley in July 1943, Ruben died September 28, 1943, after a disastrous exposure to phosgene in a laboratory accident the preceding day.

Sam Ruben married Helena Collins West, a fellow chemistry student, during his final semester as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, on September 28, 1935. They had three children: Dana West Ruben (born November 11, 1938), George Collins Ruben (born April 29, 1941), who became a professor at Dartmouth College, and Connie Mae Ruben Fatt (born June 18, 1943).

<text>The Sikorsky CH-37 Mojave (company designation S-56) is an American large heavy-lift military helicopter of the 1950s. It entered service as the HR2S-1 Deuce with USMC in 1956, and as the H-37A Mojave with the U.S. Army that same year. In the early 1960s, the designation was standardized to CH-37 for both services, with the HR2S-1 redesignated as CH-37C specifically.

Developed in the early 1950s, with its first flight in 1953, it filled a 1950 Navy requirement for an assault helicopter. The design includes a front-loading ramp with side opening clam shell doors on the nose. It is powered by two radial piston engines. It served in active military service well into the 1960s, including in Indochina, before being replaced, and many ex-military models went onto civilian service in the 1970s. This was the biggest helicopter in the world to enter service at the time, and one of the earliest twin engine models. It was known for being noisy but earned a good reputation for reliability. The Navy also adapted it to carry a naval radar, with two entering service as HR2S-1W.

The design led to a production attempt as the Westland Westminster in the United Kingdom; prototypes were produced, but it did not go into full production. The S-56 was also the basis for the S-60 Skycrane helicopter prototype.

==Design and development==


The S-56 came into being as an assault transport for the United States Marine Corps (USMC), with a capacity of 26 fully equipped Marines. An order for the aircraft was placed in 1951 using the U.S. Navy/U.S. Marine Corps designation of the time of HR2S. The first prototype, the XHR2S-1 flew in 1953, and production deliveries of the HR2S-1 &quot;Deuce&quot; began in July 1956 to Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), with a total of sixty aircraft being produced.

The United States Army evaluated the prototype in 1954 and ordered 94 examples as the CH-37A, the first being delivered in summer 1956. All Marine Corps and Army examples were delivered by mid-1960. Army examples were all upgraded to CH-37B status in the early 1960s, being given Lear auto-stabilization equipment and the ability to load and unload while hovering. In the 1962 unification of United States military aircraft designations, the USMC examples were redesignated from HR2S-1 to CH-37C.

At the time of delivery, the CH-37 was the largest helicopter in the Western world and it was Sikorsky&#x27;s first twin-engine helicopter. Two Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp radial engines were mounted in outboard pods that also contained the retractable landing gear. This left the fuselage free for cargo, which could be loaded and unloaded through large clamshell doors in the nose. The early models could carry a payload of either three M422 Mighty Mites (a lightweight jeep-like vehicle) or 26 troops. For storage, the main rotor blades folded back on the fuselage and the tail rotor mast folded forward on the fuselage.

The CH-37 was one of the last heavy helicopters to use piston engines, which were larger, heavier and less powerful than the turboshaft engines employed in later military helicopters. This accounted for the CH-37&#x27;s fairly short service life, all being withdrawn from service by the late 1960s, replaced in Army service by the distantly related CH-54 Tarhe and in the Marine Corps by the CH-53 Sea Stallion.

Six CH-37C&#x27;s were deployed to Vietnam in September 1965 to assist in the recovery of downed U.S. aircraft, serving in this role from Marble Mountain Air Facility until May 14, 1967. They were very successful at this role, recovering over US$7.5 million worth of equipment, some of which was retrieved from behind enemy lines. The CH-37 was also used to recover film capsules descending from space by parachute.

A total of 154 were produced by the time production ended. Of those, 94 were H-37A, and 90 that were converted to H-37B (later CH-37A and B respectively). It remains the largest piston powered helicopter.

;Sikorsky S-60
: a prototype &quot;sky-crane&quot; with a skeletal fuselage and a crew cockpit at the front.
;Westland Westminster
: Unable to get government support for licence production of the civil S-56, Westland Aircraft used the S-56 control systems, rotors and gearbox as the basis for the Westminster but used their own tubular frame and twin Napier Eland turboshafts for power in a flying test rig. Due to vibration they changed to a six-bladed S-64 rotor. The private venture project was ended when Westland took over three British helicopter companies and their more advanced and funded projects.

<text>Manuel Rubén Abimael Guzmán Reinoso (; 3 December 1934 − 11 September 2021), also known by his &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Chairman Gonzalo (), was a Peruvian Maoist guerrilla leader. He founded the organization Communist Party of Peru – Shining Path (PCP-SL) in 1969 and led a rebellion against the Peruvian government until his capture by authorities on 12 September 1992. He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for terrorism and treason.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Guzmán was a professor of philosophy active in far-left politics strongly influenced by Marxism, Leninism, and Maoism. He developed an ideology of armed struggle stressing the empowerment of the Indigenous people. He went underground in the mid-1970s to become the leader of the Shining Path, which began &quot;The People&#x27;s War&quot; or the &quot;Armed Struggle&quot; on 17 May 1980.

== Early life ==

Manuel Rubén Abimael Guzmán Reinoso was born on 3 December 1934 in Mollendo, a port town in the province of Islay, in the region of Arequipa, about south of Lima. He was the illegitimate son of a well-off merchant, who had eight children by five different women. Guzmán&#x27;s mother, Berenice Reinoso, died when he was five.
At Arequipa, Guzmán completed bachelor&#x27;s degrees in philosophy and law. His dissertations were titled &quot;The Kantian Theory of Space&quot; and &quot;The Bourgeois Democratic State&quot;. In 1962, Guzmán was recruited as a professor of philosophy by the rector of San Cristóbal of Huamanga University in Ayacucho, a city in the central Peruvian Andes. The rector was Efraín Morote Best, an anthropologist who some believe later became the true intellectual leader of the &quot;Shining Path movement.&quot; Encouraged by Morote, Guzmán studied Quechua, the language spoken by Peru&#x27;s Indigenous population, and became increasingly active in left-wing political circles.

In 1965, Guzman attended a cadre training course in China, returning to Lima and taking a leave of absence from his professorship to focus on party activism. In April 1967, Guzman led his fraction of the PCP to an international meeting in Albania, and would return to China between August and September of that same year. This placed him in China during the Cultural Revolution, which made a large impression on him.

He attracted several like-minded young academics committed to bringing about revolution in Peru. Guzmán was arrested twice during the 1970s because of his participation in violent riots in the city of Arequipa against the government of presidents Velasco Alvarado and Belaunde Terry. He visited the People&#x27;s Republic of China with his then-wife Augusta La Torre for the first time in 1965. After serving as the head of personnel for San Cristóbal of Huamanga University, Guzmán left the institution in the mid-1970s and went underground.

In the 1960s, the Peruvian Communist Party had splintered over ideological and personal disputes. Guzmán, who had taken a pro-Chinese rather than pro-Soviet line, emerged as the leader of the faction which came to be known as the &quot;Shining Path&quot; (Mariátegui wrote once: &quot;Marxism–Leninism is the shining path of the future&quot;). In 1970, Bandera Roja expelled Guzmán because of his and his group&#x27;s &quot;occultism&quot; - a Marxist-Leninist term for refusing or being unable to carry out open or legal political work, and excessively focusing on covert activities.

Guzmán adopted the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Presidente or Comrade Gonzalo and began advocating a peasant-led revolution on the Maoist model. His followers declared Guzmán, who cultivated anonymity, to be the &quot;Fourth Sword of Communism&quot; (after Marx, Lenin, and Mao). In his political declarations, Guzmán praised Mao&#x27;s development of Lenin&#x27;s thesis regarding &quot;the role of imperialism&quot; in propping up the &quot;bourgeois capitalist system&quot;. He claimed that imperialism ultimately &quot;creates disruption and is unsuccessful, and it will end up in ruins in the next 50 to 100 years&quot;. Guzmán applied this criticism not only to U.S. imperialism, but also Soviet imperialism, to what he termed as &quot;social-imperialism&quot; (in accordance with the Chinese stance after the Sino-Soviet split).

In February 1964, he married Augusta La Torre, who was instrumental in founding Shining Path. She died under unclear circumstances in 1988. Guzmán and Elena Yparraguirre, a long-time lieutenant of Guzmán&#x27;s and his lover, have both refused to talk about La Torre&#x27;s fate since their imprisonments. In the fall of 2006, while in prison, Guzmán proposed to Iparraguirre, who is also serving a life sentence in a separate prison. After fighting for the permission to marry with a hunger strike, the couple wed in late August 2010.

Guzmán had long identified with atheism. He agreed with Karl Marx about religion as the &quot;opium of the people&quot;, and viewed it as a &quot;social phenomena product of the exploitation and that will extinguish while exploitation finishes to be swept and a new society arise&quot;. However, he pleaded respect for religious diversity and claimed religion would not be an obstacle for the armed struggle.

==Insurgency==
The Shining Path movement was at first largely confined to academic circles in Peruvian universities. In the late 1970s, however, the movement developed into a guerrilla group centered around Ayacucho. In May 1980, the group launched its war against the government of Peru by burning the ballot boxes in Chuschi, a village near Ayacucho, in an effort to disrupt the first democratic elections in the country since 1964. Shining Path eventually grew to control vast rural territories in central and southern Peru and achieved a presence even in the outskirts of Lima, where it staged numerous attacks. The purpose of Shining Path&#x27;s campaign was to demoralize and undermine the government of Peru in order to create a situation conducive to a violent coup which would put its leaders in power. The Shining Path targeted not only the army and police, but also government employees at all levels, other leftist militants such as members of the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), workers who did not participate in the strikes organized by the group, peasants who cooperated with the government in any way (including by voting in democratic elections), and middle-class inhabitants of Peru&#x27;s main cities. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission later estimated that the resulting conflict led to the deaths of some seventy thousand people, approximately half of them at the hands of the Shining Path and a third at the hands of the state.

Guzmán&#x27;s image as a dispassionate murderer became widespread after he moved against the city of Lima. After a series of bombings and selective assassinations the whole nation was shocked in 1992 when a car bomb exploded in one of Lima&#x27;s busiest commercial districts on Tarata street, thus causing many casualties and enormous material losses. Guzmán denied responsibility for the Tarata bombing, claiming it was carried out without his knowledge.

The movement promoted the writings of Guzmán, called &quot;Gonzalo Thought&quot;, a new &quot;theoretical understanding&quot; that built upon Marxism, Leninism, and Maoism whereby he declared Maoism to be a &quot;third and higher stage of Marxism,&quot; having defined Maoism as &quot;people&#x27;s war.&quot; In 1989, Guzmán declared that the Shining Path (which he referred to as the &quot;Communist Party of Peru&quot;) had progressed from waging a people&#x27;s war to waging a &quot;war of movements.&quot; He further argued that this was a step towards achieving &quot;strategic equilibrium&quot; in the near future, based on Maoist theories of waging people&#x27;s war. Guzmán claimed that such an equilibrium would manifest itself by ungovernability under the &quot;old order.&quot; When that moment arrived, Guzmán believed that Shining Path would be ready to move on to its &quot;strategic offensive&quot;.

== The &quot;Captura del Siglo&quot; ==

In 1992, during the first administration of President Alberto Fujimori, the National Directorate Against Terrorism (DIRCOTE) began surveillance on several residences in Lima because agents suspected that terrorists were using them as safehouses. One of those residences, in the upper-class neighborhood of Surco, had been operating as a ballet studio. The DIRCOTE operatives routinely searched the garbage taken out from the house. The house was supposedly inhabited by only one person, the dance teacher , but it was soon noticed that the household produced more garbage than one person could account for. Furthermore, agents found discarded tubes of cream for the treatment of psoriasis, an ailment that Guzmán was known to have. On 12 September 1992, an elite unit of the DIRCOTE carried out Operation Victoria, raiding the Surco residence. On the second floor of the house, they found and arrested Guzmán and eight others, including Laura Zambrano and Elena Yparraguirre, Guzmán&#x27;s female companion.

== Trials and imprisonment ==

Guzmán was tried by a court of hooded military judges under provisions of articles 15 and 16 of Law 25475 adopted by Fujimori&#x27;s government in May 1992 after April&#x27;s constitutional crisis. After a three-day trial, Guzmán was sentenced to life imprisonment and incarcerated at the naval base on the island of San Lorenzo off the coast of Lima.

Subsequently, he was said to have negotiated with a presidential advisor at the time, Vladimiro Montesinos, in order to receive some benefits in exchange for helping the Peruvian government put an end to the Shining Path&#x27;s militant activities. Guzmán appeared several times on Peruvian television and on 1 October 1993, he publicly declared &quot;peace&quot; with the Peruvian government. This declaration split the Shining Path and raised questions about the organization&#x27;s future. About 6,000 guerrillas within the party accepted it as a sign of defeat and surrendered.

Guzmán&#x27;s re-trial began on 5 November 2004. The international press was held in a sound-proof chamber and all media was banned from observing the trial after the Shining Path cadre turned their backs on the judges and delivered a revolutionary salute to the media gallery. The only words Guzmán spoke in the presence of the international press were &quot;Long live the Communist Party of Peru! Glory to Marxism–Leninism–Maoism! Glory to the Peruvian people! Long live the heroes of the people&#x27;s war!&quot; After he made this statement, the courtroom microphones were silenced and the press was unable to hear any of the proceedings that followed. When the trial resumed on 12 November, no reporters were allowed to observe the proceedings. Eventually two of the judges recused themselves and the trial ended in chaos. Guzmán&#x27;s third trial began in September 2005 and was opened and closed amid a media blackout. No reporters were allowed to attend.

=== Sentence ===
On 13 October 2006, Guzmán was sentenced to life in prison on charges of aggravated terrorism and murder. At his sentencing, three judges read the charges in a verdict that lasted more than six hours.

In 2014, Guzmán and his wife Iparraguirre were tried again, for the 1992 Tarata bombing in Lima in which 25 people died. On 11 September 2018, he was sentenced to a second life term in prison.

Guzmán was incarcerated in the maximum security prison of the naval base of Callao, the port of Lima, until his death in 2021. Fellow prisoners there include Víctor Polay, leader of the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, and Vladimiro Montesinos, the former head of the National Intelligence Service who supervised the construction of the prison and served under the President Alberto Fujimori.

== Death ==
On 13 July 2021, he was attended by medical personnel of the Ministry of Health after he refused to eat. He was given blood tests and an ultrasound. A few days later, on 17 July, he was transferred to a hospital for further monitoring. He died on 11 September 2021 at the Maximum Safety Center of the Callao Naval Base, at the age of 86.

Guzmán&#x27;s body was cremated on the dawn of 24 September 2021 and his ashes were dispersed in a secret location in order to prevent a monument honoring him from being created.

<text>Kay Toinette Oslin (May 15, 1942 – December 21, 2020) was an American country music singer-songwriter. She had several years of major commercial success in the late 1980s after signing a record deal at age 45. Oslin had four number one hits and placed additional singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart during that timespan; in addition, she won three Grammy Awards and is an inductee of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Oslin moved to Alabama after the death of her father, then to Texas. She developed an appreciation for folk music while studying theater in college and later started a folk trio. In 1966, she returned to theater after being cast in the touring production of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; She then moved to New York City, where she continued acting in Broadway musicals and television commercials. At the same time, she began songwriting as a hobby. After a demo recording was made of her music, Oslin briefly signed to Elektra Records in 1981 without much success. She later signed to RCA Records in 1986 and had her first major hit the following year with &quot;80&#x27;s Ladies&quot;. Her 1987 debut album of the same name would sell over one million copies and produce three additional hits, including the number one single &quot;Do Ya&quot;.

Oslin released &quot;This Woman&quot; (1988) and &quot;Love in a Small Town&quot; (1990), which reached the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The albums spawned hit singles including &quot;Hold Me&quot;, &quot;Hey Bobby&quot; and &quot;Come Next Monday&quot;. In the early 1990s, she left her recording contract and went into a hiatus following several personal setbacks. In 1996, she returned with the studio album &quot;&quot;My Roots Are Showing...&quot;&quot; and then in 2001 with &quot;Live Close By, Visit Often.&quot; Oslin released her final album in 2015 titled &quot;Simply.&quot;

==Early years==
Oslin was born in Crossett, Arkansas, in 1942 to Larry and Kathleen Oslin. When Oslin was 5, her father died from leukemia, leaving her mother widowed. His death resulted in her becoming shy and withdrawn. The family moved to Mobile, Alabama, following her father&#x27;s death, which is where Oslin spent her childhood. When she was a teenager, her mother moved her family to Houston, Texas, where she would eventually graduate from high school. She became fond of music during her formative years in music inspired from her mother. Oslin&#x27;s mother had once performed Swing music on local radio and also was offered a job singing in the Les Brown orchestra. She studied drama at Lon Morris College in Texas, where she also drew a deep appreciation for folk music.

While in college, Oslin formed a folk trio with David Jones and singer-songwriter Guy Clark. Together, they performed in local cubs, restaurants and other venues in Texas. The trio eventually recorded a song for a 1963 folk compilation titled &quot;Look, It&#x27;s Us!&quot; On lead vocals, Oslin performed the tune &quot;Brave Young Soldier&quot;. She would later form a folk duo with Frank Davis. In Hollywood, California, the pair—billed as &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot;—recorded an album, which was not released. Oslin returned to Houston following the stint. In 1966, a touring production of the Broadway musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; came to the Houston area in search of &quot;chorus girls&quot; for their ensemble cast. Oslin auditioned, got the part and began touring the same year.

==Career==
===1966–1986: Broadway, commercials and beginnings in Nashville===
In 1966, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;″s national tour ended and Oslin moved to New York City to pursue acting. She remained in the city for 20 years where she got several small stage role parts. Oslin appeared as part of the ensemble in the Broadway shows &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; and &quot;West Side Story.&quot; She also found work singing commercial jingles. She was often cast in hygiene-product commercials. In an interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune,&quot; Oslin recalled being cast in a hemorrhoid commercial: &quot;Hemorrhoids! Lord! I had a hemorrhoid commercial that had people I knew from the 3d grade calling me up saying, &#x27;Is that you?&#x27;&quot; Oslin also developed an interest in songwriting after being given a piano. She taught herself chord patterns and wrote music that went along with it. Her interest in country music also developed after New York started their first country radio station. She found the music to be more sophisticated than what it previously had been and began writing country songs after that. While performing as part of a synthesizer troupe, Oslin was inspired to write her first country song from writing she saw on a bathroom wall. Written on the wall were the words, &quot;I ain&#x27;t gonna love nobody but Cornell Crawford.&quot; Oslin wrote the song with friend Joe Miller and she would later record it in 1990.
Oslin eventually made a demonstration tape of her compositions and brought them to the attention of the performance rights group SESAC. From there, it was brought to the attention of their Nashville executive, Dianne Petty. Petty encouraged Oslin&#x27;s musical talent and helped bring her music to the attention of Nashville record executives. At the same time, Oslin also found work singing with Guy Clark on his 1978 self-titled album. Through Petty&#x27;s assistance, Oslin acquired a &quot;singles-only&quot; recording contract with Elektra Records. Only two singles were issued on the label, &quot;Younger Men&quot; and &quot;Clean Your Own Tables&quot;, the latter of which became a minor hit on the country chart. &quot;My first record, &#x27;Clean Your Own Tables,&#x27; managed to get on the charts for about 15 minutes,&quot; she recalled in 1987. Elektra ultimately dropped her from their label in 1982. She returned to New York where she went into a depressive period and gained 40 pounds. She continued commercial work, but found it unsatisfying. Yet Petty continued advocating for Oslin and her original compositions were recorded by Judy Rodman, Dottie West, Gail Davies and The Judds.

In 1986, Oslin decided to make a final effort to regain a recording contract. She borrowed seven thousand dollars from her aunt, lost 40 pounds, rented a Nashville nightclub and invited record executives to a one-time music showcase. &quot;The next morning, I sat waiting for the phone to ring. It did not,&quot; she recounted. Yet, through her connections, Oslin contacted Nashville producer Harold Shedd, who had recently been successful recording Alabama. Shedd convinced Oslin to record three of her original tunes and he eventually became her full-time production collaborator. She also met RCA Records executive Joe Galante in 1986. Galante believed Oslin had potential and signed her to RCA in 1986 when Oslin was 45 years old.

===1987–1993: &quot;80&#x27;s Ladies&quot; and commercial breakout===
In January 1987, RCA released Oslin&#x27;s first label single, titled &quot;Wall of Tears&quot;. Despite breaking into the top 40, the song failed to become a major hit. In April, the label issued the self-penned &quot;80&#x27;s Ladies&quot;, which became her first major hit. Oslin had written the tune several years prior in small chunks over time. &quot;I thought it was one of those show pieces. I never dreamed or thought it would be a single,&quot; she stated in 2011. The single peaked at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart in July and went to number four on the &quot;RPM&quot; Country Singles chart in Canada. It would later win the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and Song of the Year at the Country Music Association Awards. Oslin became the CMA&#x27;s first female artist to win the Song of the Year accolade. &quot;80&#x27;s Ladies&quot; also received a positive response from critics. Steve Huey of Allmusic called the track &quot;anthemic,&quot; while Mary Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann called it &quot;the anthem of a generation.&quot; Bill Friskics-Warren of &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared its piano sound to that of Jackson Browne. On June 30, 1987, Oslin&#x27;s debut studio album of the same name was released on RCA. It became the highest-charting album by a female country artist in 20 years, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart in February 1988. It was also her highest-charting release on the Billboard 200 reaching a peak of 68 in March 1988. It would later certify platinum in the United States for selling over one million copies. Both of the follow-up singles to &quot;80&#x27;s Ladies&quot; (&quot;Do Ya&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Come Back&quot;) reached number one on the country chart.
Oslin&#x27;s musical success allowed her to become more financially stable. By 1988, she purchased her first house, but was rarely home due to a demanding tour schedule. That year, she toured with Alabama and George Strait, and recorded her second album for RCA. In August 1988, &quot;This Woman&quot; was released. Oslin wrote (or co-wrote) all ten of the album&#x27;s tracks. According to Oslin, &quot;This Woman&quot; reflected the modern thinking of middle-aged women of the eighties. The project received critical acclaim from various publications. Alex Henderson of Allmusic gave it a three-star rating, calling it &quot;a generally appealing release that successfully balances commercial and artistic considerations.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it one of their &quot;12 Classic Albums&quot; in 2018 and found it to define female independence. Rock critic Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;B&quot; rating, praising the album&#x27;s defiance of gender roles in the Nashville establishment. It produced the number one hit, &quot;Hold Me&quot;, which would also win her a second Grammy award. It was followed by the top five hits, &quot;Hey Bobby&quot; and its title track.

Oslin had continued success into the 1990s. That year, she performed at Carnegie Hall alongside new singer Clint Black, who also served as the opening act of her newly established headlining tour. However, her constant road schedule was negatively affecting her mental health. She took several months off from appearances to refocus and readjust her mental health. &quot;It took me months to become a human,&quot; she told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1990. Oslin also took time to write and record her third studio album. In late 1990, &quot;Love in a Small Town&quot; was released on RCA Records. The project peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart and spent 71 weeks there. Despite the album&#x27;s first single becoming only a minor hit, the second single, &quot;Come Next Monday&quot;, would be her fourth number one single on the country chart. It was followed by the top 40 hit, &quot;Mary and Willie&quot;, and the charting singles &quot;You Call Everybody Darling&quot; and &quot;Cornell Crawford&quot;.

Oslin spent more time away from music as the decade progressed. Her last album project for RCA would be the 1993 compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits: Songs from an Aging Sex Bomb.&quot; The compilation peaked at number 28 on the Top Country Albums list and number 126 on the Billboard 200. Along with eight of her major hits, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; also included three new songs. Notably included was a re-recording of &quot;New Way Home&quot;. It was later released as single and spent three weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. Jack Hurst of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; found its new tracks to be &quot;pop sounding&quot; but also found it to blend effectively with her previous hits. Allmusic&#x27;s Rick Anderson rated it four out of five stars, yet also observed it to have pop inflections. However, he found the quality of the writing and sound to be quite high: &quot;This is great pop music, no matter what bin you find it in.&quot;

===1993–2015: Acting transition, hiatus and return to the spotlight===
Oslin began turning her career towards acting by 1994. This began with a guest appearance on the television western, &quot;Paradise.&quot; Oslin portrayed a mother living in rural America and performed the song, &quot;Down in the Valley&quot;. She would also appear on a television special with Carol Burnett where she performed a duet version of her song, &quot;New Way Home&quot;. In 1993, Oslin made her first appearance in a film called &quot;The Thing Called Love.&quot; She starred alongside Hollywood actors Sandra Bullock and River Phoenix. Directed by Peter Bogdanovich, the film&#x27;s plot focused on Nashville and the main character&#x27;s dream of becoming a country music songwriter. Oslin portrayed Lucy, a fictional owner of the Bluebird Café. Reviewers, including &quot;The Austin Chronicle,&quot; disliked the movie, but praised Oslin&#x27;s performance. &quot;She&#x27;s so country and so good in her role, she reveals the rest of the movie to be as artificial as it is,&quot; Louis Black wrote in 1993. Also in 1993, Oslin appeared in the television movie, &quot;Poisoned by Love: The Kern County Murders.&quot; In 1994, she guest-starred in the Arkansas-themed series &quot;Evening Shade.&quot; Oslin portrayed one of three sisters headed to audition for the Grand Ole Opry.

Oslin would also take several years away from music during the mid 1990s. She faced several personal setbacks including a severe depression, side effects from menopause and quadruple bypass surgery. Following her recovery, Oslin was coaxed back into recording from former label-head Joe Galante. Teaming up with sound engineer Rick Will, she produced and recorded 1996&#x27;s &quot;&quot;My Roots Are Showing...&quot;,&quot; which was released on BNA Records. The album contained cover versions of lesser-known country and pop recordings. It was received unfavorably by Allmusic, which only rated it 2.5 stars. Bill Carpenter commented that &quot;The only issue is that this was marketed as a country album when the Nashville element isn&#x27;t terribly conspicuous.&quot; However, Robert K. Oermann of &quot;Music Row&quot; commented that the album showcased how Oslin was an example of the &quot;emerging Americana music movement.&quot; &quot;My Roots Are Showing...&quot; reached number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart and spawned the charting single, &quot;Silver Tongue and Gold Plated Lies&quot;.

After another hiatus, Oslin released her fifth studio album titled, &quot;Live Close By, Visit Often,&quot; in 2001. She co-produced the album with The Mavericks&#x27; lead vocalist Raul Malo. The album included a range of musical styles, such as country, electronic dance and Latin. &quot;Live Close By, Visit Often&quot; received mixed reviews. Allmusic&#x27;s Maria Konicki Dinoia commented that the project was &quot;too eclectic to call country [and] too divergent to call pop.&quot; Alanna Nash found the album to be &quot;schizophrenic&quot; in its musical diversity, but did praise Oslin&#x27;s vocal performance throughout. &quot;Live Close By, Visit Often&quot; spent 11 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums list and peaked at number 35, becoming her final charting album. Its title track was released as the first single and reached a minor chart position on the country songs list. Its second single, a cover of Rosemary Clooney&#x27;s &quot;Come on-a My House&quot; would make the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance music chart.

Oslin went into a third career hiatus after 2001. Speaking to &quot;Country Music Television&quot; in 2011, she explained that the decision to stop performing was conscious. &quot;I asked my people, &#x27;Do I have enough money to quit right now?&#x27; and they said, &#x27;Yeah.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Well, then, I quit!&#x27;&quot; She spent frequent time at home and enjoying hobbies, such as painting. In 2008, she performed a one-woman show, which included a music and words. In 2013, she returned to the stage to perform at the Franklin Theater for the twenty-fifth anniversary of her studio album, &quot;80&#x27;s Ladies.&quot; In 2014, Oslin performed a live cabaret show, which would inspire the recording of her final studio album. In 2015, &quot;Simply&quot; was released on Red River Entertainment. The album contained re-recordings of her previous material and one new track titled, &quot;Do You Think About Me&quot;. &quot;Simply&quot; contained a session band that consisted of only four players. According to a 2015 interview, Oslin stated she decided to make the album so that fans could buy new music at her shows. Oslin went into her final retirement following the record&#x27;s release.

==Musical styles==
In a 1988 interview, Oslin described her own musical style as stemming from country, southern blues and R&amp;B: &quot;It&#x27;s a mishmash of stuff. I&#x27;m surprised people like it. They should be asking: &#x27;What is this stuff?&#x27; I ask that myself all the time.&quot; Oslin&#x27;s musical style is rooted in country, but also incorporates elements of country pop, pop rock and adult contemporary. Examples of pop and &quot;anthemic rock&quot; can be found in her first two RCA albums, as noted by Steve Huey of Allmusic. When reviewing 1988&#x27;s &quot;This Woman,&quot; Allmusic&#x27;s Alex Henderson also drew similar comparisons, calling her sound &quot;far from a honky tonker.&quot; Oslin incorporated more dance, traditional pop, Latin and Americana into her musical style after leaving RCA.

Her musical style can also be identified with her songwriting. As a musical artist, Oslin wrote most of her material. Many of her compositions centered on characters going through the trials and tribulations of middle age. According to Oslin, she developed songwriting inspiration from her friends who were going through martial difficulties. &quot;I learn from watching people and try to put it in terms that music fans would find interesting,&quot; she explained in 1988. Bill Friskics-Warren of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Oslin &quot;gave voice to the desires and trials of female baby boomers on the cusp of middle age.&quot; In &quot;Finding Her Voice: The History of Women in Country Music,&quot; Oslin &quot;became the beacon of inspiration for every middle-aged woman who felt vibrant yet overlooked.&quot; Dennis Hunt of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; called her writing &quot;penetrating, vivid tales of women in turmoil.&quot;

Oslin was largely influenced as a child by traditional pop and country performers, notably Patsy Cline and Kay Starr. As she started performing folk music in the 1960s, Oslin&#x27;s musical inspiration drew away from country and pop. Yet, once writing her own music, Oslin began finding connections back into country music despite not necessarily looking for it: &quot;I was writing songs--country songs for some weird reason--even though I didn&#x27;t want to be a songwriter,&quot; she commented.

==Legacy and honors==
Oslin&#x27;s success helped give identity to strong, female women in their middle-aged years, according to several publications. Sarah Trahern, CEO of the Country Music Association remarked on her legacy in 2020: &quot;K.T. Oslin had one of the most soulful voices in country music and was a strong influence for women with her hit &#x27;80&#x27;s Ladies&#x27;...She truly had one of the best voices in the history of our format.&quot; Lorrie Morgan made a similar comment in 2020: &quot;She was a big inspiration to me and her writing about the strength of women.&quot; Her artistry helped influence other female country singer–songwriters that followed such as Brandy Clark and Chely Wright. Mary Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann commented on her musical legacy in 2003: &quot;K. T. was part of a 1980s invasion of female songwriting talent into Nashville. Today, virtually every major song publisher in [Music City] has female staff writers.&quot;

Oslin was part of a group of country artists who helped shift its musical sound in the late 1980s. Writers and critics have cited her as an innovator of Nashville&#x27;s musical shift, along with Steve Earle, k. d. lang and Lyle Lovett. Bill Friskics-Warren of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that Oslin was &quot;among a distinguished circle of thoughtful, independent female songwriting contemporaries that included Pam Tillis, Gretchen Peters and Matraca Berg.&quot; Oslin also received several honors for her legacy. In 2014, she was inducted into the Texas Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2018, she was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.

==Personal life and death==
Oslin never married. However, she did have several long-term relationships through her middle age. This included a several-year relationship in the 1970s with Alan Rubin, a musician and former member of The Blues Brothers. The couple lived for two years in upstate New York in a rural community. The relationship dissolved after two years and Oslin moved back to New York City. It was Rubin who gave Oslin her first piano following their separation. Oslin would dive into songwriting following her breakup: &quot;That pulling back period is when I started to write.&quot; Oslin later dated record producer Steve Buckingham and drummer Owen Hale. However, these relationships eventually ended. &quot;I&#x27;m alone, but I like my own company,&quot; she told &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1993.

In the early 1990s, Oslin revealed a battle with menopausal depression. This caused her to lose interest in creating music, including songwriting and performing. According to Oslin, she returned to normalcy after she stopped taking hormones prescribed by her doctor. Oslin&#x27;s mother died around the same period, which caused further depressive episodes. In 1995, she began suffering from chest pain after spending a summer mowing her lawn. It was discovered after several examinations that she needed quadruple bypass surgery. Although making a full recovery, she had a permanent triangular scar that she refused to remove from promotional photographs.

In June 2015, Oslin was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and moved into an assisted-living facility the following year. She died on December 21, 2020, in Nashville, a week after being diagnosed with COVID-19 during the pandemic in Tennessee. She was 78 years old. She was interred at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Nashville adjacent to fellow country music star Tammy Wynette.

<text>Ra&#x27;s al Ghul is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly as an adversary of the superhero Batman. Created by editor Julius Schwartz, writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil, and artist Neal Adams, the character first appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #232&#x27;s &quot;Daughter of the Demon&quot; (June 1971).

Most notable as the leader of the League of Assassins, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s name in Arabic translates to &quot;Head of the Demon&quot;. He is the son of Sensei; the father of Talia al Ghul, Ali al Ghul, Nyssa Raatko, Dusan al Ghul and Arkady Duvall; and the maternal grandfather of Damian Wayne. Stories featuring Ra&#x27;s al Ghul often involve the Lazarus Pits, which restore life to the dying. The Lazarus Pits have considerably prolonged Ra&#x27;s&#x27; life, making him particularly dangerous, as he has honed his combat skills for centuries. Though primarily an enemy of Batman, Ra&#x27;s has also come into conflict with Superman and other heroes in the DC Universe.

Ra&#x27;s al Ghul has been featured in various media adaptations. The character was portrayed by David Warner in the DC Animated Universe, Liam Neeson in the &quot;Dark Knight&quot; trilogy, Jason Isaacs in &quot;&quot;, Dee Bradley Baker in the &quot;&quot; video game series, Matt Nable in the Arrowverse television series, and Alexander Siddig in &quot;Gotham&quot;.

IGN&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time List ranked Ra&#x27;s as number seven.

==Publication history==
Created by editor Julius Schwartz, writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil, and artist Neal Adams, he was introduced in &quot;Batman&quot; #232&#x27;s &quot;Daughter of the Demon&quot; (June 1971). Adams discussed how he designed the character in a 2007 &quot;Wizard&quot; interview: &quot;First of all, Denny O&#x27;Neil started as a journalist, and so his experience with costume characters was always a forced experience. When the idea came to Julie Schwartz that &quot;we&#x27;re kind of reviving old characters. What do we want to do for a new character?&quot; Denny&#x27;s tendency - and I understood it totally - was not to go to a costumed character with superpowers, but to go to a Moriarty type. When Denny presented it, here I was as a comic-book artist who was used to doing fairly realistic stuff having to deal with, &quot;Hey, no costume.&quot; How do I make him unique? Because after all, we are pandering to our audience a little bit. How does he become unique? So, I sort of went down the list of things that I could do that didn&#x27;t offend my sensibilities as an artist and as a person that lived in the world. How do you make a person unique? And then I realized there are people that look unique, that present their personality with their physiognomy - like Jack Palance, for example. Jack Palance is incredible to look at.&quot;

==Character overview==
Raʼs al Ghul is an international criminal mastermind whose ultimate goal is a world in perfect environmental balance. He believes that the best way to achieve this balance is to eliminate most of humanity. Ra&#x27;s usually tries to assault the world&#x27;s human populace with a biological weapon, such as a genetically engineered virus. He is aided in this quest by the Lazarus Pits, reservoirs of rejuvenating chemicals that restore the dead and dying to life, a reference to the biblical story of Lazarus, who was resurrected by Jesus; these pits have granted him a lifespan of several centuries. He regards Batman as his worthiest opponent, addressing him as &quot;Detective&quot; out of respect for his intellectual brilliance, and has frequently sought to make the Dark Knight his successor. He is one of the few criminals in Batman&#x27;s rogues&#x27; gallery to have deduced his secret identity as Bruce Wayne, but keeps silent on the matter due to the same sense of respect for Batman. For his own part, Batman&#x27;s opposition to Raʼs is complicated by both his own respect for al Ghul&#x27;s genius (if not his goals and methods) and his attraction to his daughter, Talia, which she reciprocates.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s real name, early life, and exact age have been described differently by various writers. His post &quot;Crisis&quot; origin story is told in the graphic novel &quot;Batman: Birth of the Demon&quot; (1992) by Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Norm Breyfogle. This origin story is later revisited and amended in &quot;Batman&quot; Annual #26 (2007) by Peter Milligan and David López as part of the &quot;Batman: The Resurrection of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&quot; story arc. Most recent retelling origin story, &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; (vol. 2) #23.3 (2013) by James Tynion IV and Jeremy Haun, references these prior iterations of al Ghul&#x27;s origin, while keeping common details that lead towards Ra&#x27;s&#x27; adoption of the moniker (e.g. Ra&#x27;s&#x27; occupation as a physician, his wife&#x27;s death, and the annihilation of the Sultan&#x27;s city).

As told in &quot;Birth of the Demon&quot;, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul (known only as the Physician prior to adopting the moniker) was born over 600 years before his first appearance in &quot;Batman&quot; comics, to a desert tribe in eastern North Africa, near a wealthy city governed by a sultan. Developing an interest in the sciences at an early age, Ra&#x27;s abandoned his tribe to live in the city, where he focused himself on learning and experimentation. He subsequently trained as a physician and married a woman named Sora.

Upon discovering the healing properties of the Lazarus Pit, Ra&#x27;s managed to save the Sultan&#x27;s dying son by lowering him into it. He is unaware, though, that use of the Lazarus Pit can induce insanity, and the prince (who is already sadistic and cruel), emerges as a mentally unstable sociopath. He proceeds to fatally strangle Sora, on whom he has already had his eye for some time. The sultan, unwilling to admit to himself his son&#x27;s culpability, accuses Ra&#x27;s of poisoning his son&#x27;s mind and sentences him to a slow, tortured death in a cage with Sora&#x27;s corpse.
Ra&#x27;s is set free by the son of a dying elderly woman, who Ra&#x27;s had earlier treated. The son feels that he owes Ra&#x27;s a debt for easing his mother&#x27;s suffering during her last few hours. Ra&#x27;s and the son head into the desert to seek the tribe of Ra&#x27;s&#x27; birth. Ra&#x27;s convinces the head of his tribe, his uncle, to follow Ra&#x27;s in his quest for revenge by promising the downfall of the oppressive sultan. By understanding the germ theory of disease hundreds of years before anyone else, Ra&#x27;s is able to infect the prince with a deadly virus by sending him contaminated fabrics. He then ambushes the sultan when he leads soldiers to the tribe, murders his son and him, and proceeds to massacre the inhabitants of the city before razing it to the ground. Subsequently, Ra&#x27;s declares himself &quot;Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&quot;, the &quot;Demon&#x27;s Head&quot;.

&quot;Batman: Birth of the Demon&quot; provides a rough figure of 500 years for Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s age. Due to living so long and being so old, he is assumed to have lost track of how old he is. &quot;Azrael&quot; #6 (July 1995; written by Dennis O&#x27;Neil) places Ra&#x27;s age closer to 450 years. As he tells Jean Paul Valley, &quot;I appear to be a vigorous 50. I am actually a very vigorous448...or is it 453? I lost count during the Black Plague. No matter&quot;. In &quot;Batman&quot; Annual #25 (published in 2006), Ra&#x27;s al Ghul is described as a &quot;700-Year Old International Terrorist&quot;. The 700-year-plus mark is used again in &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; (vol. 2) #23.3 (2013), followed by Issue #30 of the same series where over a 1000-year time span is also described in Ra&#x27;s&#x27; pursuit of Themyscira.

Using the Lazarus Pits to extend his life, Ra&#x27;s spends the next several centuries journeying the world. He fights in the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars and becomes a formidable warrior. As the world entered the modern age and industrialization began to cover much of the Earth, Ra&#x27;s grew to despise the humans, whom he believed were destroying the world&#x27;s natural beauty, thus setting him on a path of ecoterrorism. Also during this time, Ra&#x27;s, his uncle, and Huwe, the son who freed Ra&#x27;s from the sultan&#x27;s initial execution, are all using the Lazarus Pits to prolong their lives until an incident in London. Ra&#x27;s catches Huwe writing his own memoirs in their original Chinese language, despite Ra&#x27;s having forbidden him to reveal the secret of their immortality. During a battle, Ra&#x27;s kills Huwe and flees to a Lazarus Pit, which he uses. When he returns to their home in London, his uncle has vanished with the remnants of their historical records.

Over time, he becomes a master of many forms of combat, notably fencing. He also builds up vast wealth and creates the Demon, a huge international organization. According to &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (1st series) #94:

The League of Assassins, one of the many smaller organizations making up The Demon, is thus sometimes called &quot;The Demon&#x27;s Fang&quot; or &quot;Demonfang&quot;.

In his earlier appearances, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s ethnic origins were subject to change depending on the depiction and writer. He is said to have East Asian ancestry in accordance to &quot;Birth of the Demon&quot; and Byzantine/Eastern Roman as addressed by Talia al Ghul in &quot;Batman&quot; Annual #26. The significance of al Ghul&#x27;s Eurasian profile is attributed to his known paternal heritage whilst his ambitions for world conquest is often compared and traced to the likes of Alexander the Great; an influence too shared by other family members such as Sensei (&quot;Batman&quot; #671 (2007) by Grant Morrison and Tony S. Daniel), Talia al Ghul, and Damian Wayne (&quot;Batman and Robin&quot; (vol. 2) #0 (2012) by Peter J. Tomasi and Patrick Gleason) (the name &quot;Damian&quot; being derivative of &quot;damianos&quot;, Greek for &quot;to tame&quot;). Most commonly depicted in source material with a dominant phenotype of fair complexion, Ra&#x27;s has also been able to opportunistically be involved in Western world global exploits such as the Age of Exploration (&quot;Year One: Batman/Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&quot; #2 (2005) by Devin K. Grayson and Paul Gulacy) and the Third Reich (&quot;Batman: Death and the Maidens&quot; #5 (2004) by Greg Rucka and Klaus Janson). Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s adoptive use of Arabic monikers and the language itself is a result of al Ghul&#x27;s settlement and cultured history both in erudition and regional pursuit of Lazarus Pit/longevity sources most commonly unearthed throughout the Greater Middle East (e.g. The Well of Sins in the Arabian Peninsula, &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot; #22 (2013) by James Tynion IV and Julius Gopez) to East Asia (Peaches of Immortality, &quot;Year One: Batman/Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&quot; #1). The use of Arabic monikers in particular (in regards to demons) is used as a scare tactic in Ra&#x27;s&#x27; history promoting both his influence, and reign of terror throughout the Greater Middle East—his first eradication of a sultanate as described in &quot;Birth of the Demon&quot;, the same actions insinuated to have been repeated in &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; (vol. 2) #23.3, and direct depiction in &quot;Death and the Maidens&quot; #4.

Aligning with Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s character overview as an international environmental terrorist, in conjunction with the character&#x27;s background being subject to different renditions from multiple writers; co-creator of the character, Neal Adams, has stated that the character has no specific regional/ethnic representation of any kind, necessarily. 
In the 21st century, Ra&#x27;s has explicitly been established as being of Chinese (though this may no longer be canon) and Arab ancestry. In the 2007-2008 story &quot;The Resurrection of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&quot;, his father was revealed to be the DC Comics character the Sensei, a warrior and combat instructor who is a member of the League of Assassins. The Sensei is a Chinese man originally from the Hong Kong region. However, Ra&#x27;s&#x27; relation to the Sensei may no longer be canon due to the reveal of his father being a part of the Pre-Flashpoint/Post-Crisis DC continuity that ended in 2011. In 2021, DC introduced Ra&#x27;s&#x27; mother Rúh al Ghul, an Arab woman. Ra&#x27;s and the rest of the al Ghul&#x27;s Arabic heritage and connection to Arabic culture has been given greater emphasis since the late 2010s.

===Contagion and Legacy===
Ra&#x27;s returns to prominence and comes dangerously close to realizing his dream of worldwide genocide in the story arc of the Batman titles. His organization unleashes a deadly virus known as Ebola Gulf A (a.k.a. &quot;The Clench&quot;) in Gotham City, putting Batman in conflict with a force he seemingly cannot defeat. A cure is eventually located by Batman and his allies, though the mastermind behind the outbreak is not discovered until the follow-up story .

Learning that the Demon&#x27;s Head still lives, Batman and his team circle the globe, preventing further outbreaks of the virus. Ra&#x27;s allies himself with Bane, the man who once crippled and nearly killed Batman. Ra&#x27;s considers Bane a potential heir to his empire, despite his daughter Talia&#x27;s distaste for the criminal mastermind. Eventually, Batman deduces a way to eliminate the Clench virus from an ancient &quot;Wheel of Plagues&quot; artifact whose knowledge has aided Ra&#x27;s in the creation of the disease. The long-lived madman eludes justice again.

===JLA: Tower of Babel===
In the &quot;&quot; storyline, in &quot;JLA&quot; #43–46, Ra&#x27;s discovers Batman&#x27;s contingency plans for stopping the other members of the Justice League of America, should they turn or be turned evil, and uses them to try to destroy the group. Meanwhile, Ra&#x27;s steals the bodies of Batman&#x27;s parents. This theft prevents Batman from realizing Ra&#x27;s is using his traps until it is too late, as he is distracted by the search for the corpses of his parents.

Though defeated, Ra&#x27;s does cause the temporary exit of Batman from the JLA, who now distrust the Caped Crusader. However, though some of the League resent Batman&#x27;s plans, they eventually accept that the plans were created for the right reasons once Batman confirms that he trusts them by revealing his secret identity to the rest of the team.

Talia, disillusioned with her father, leaves the League to run LexCorp for former U.S. President Lex Luthor, before selling the company to Bruce Wayne for his Wayne Foundation to aid Batman and Superman&#x27;s victory over Luthor. Ra&#x27;s blames Batman for his failed relationship with Talia, and stages a plot where he tries to separate Batman from his heir, Dick Grayson, shortly before Wayne officially adopts his former ward as his son. The plan fails, and Wayne and Grayson proceed with the adoption.

Ra&#x27;s is also featured in &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #31–35, where he has a romantic fling with the Black Canary. The superheroine is injured and healed in the Lazarus Pit, which also restores the Canary Cry she lost years earlier.

===Death and the Maidens===
In &quot;Death and the Maidens&quot; (2004), Ra&#x27;s&#x27; other daughter, Nyssa Raatko, furious at her father for abandoning her in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II, begins plotting to destroy him, prompting Ra&#x27;s to contact Batman to make a deal for access to a Lazarus Pit to give him the strength for a final confrontation with Nyssa; in exchange for the location of a Pit, Ra&#x27;s provides Batman with a serum that will allow him to walk in the spirit world and speak with his parents. While Batman experiences his &quot;vision&quot;, Nyssa befriends Talia and then kidnaps and brainwashes her. Nyssa plots to destroy all hope and optimism in the world by assassinating Superman with Kryptonite bullets she steals from the Batcave. While Batman stops Nyssa from killing Superman, he is unable to stop her from mortally injuring her father. A dying Ra&#x27;s reveals that this is all part of his greater plan to ensure that his daughters will realize that he is correct in his perceptions about the world and what needs to be done to it, and that they would come to accept their destinies as his heirs. Ra&#x27;s&#x27; plan works: both Nyssa and Talia become the heads of The Demon and the League of Assassins. Talia disavows her love for Bruce Wayne, and both sisters declare Batman their enemy. It is too late for Ra&#x27;s, as Nyssa stabs her father through the heart, seemingly killing him for good. To ensure Ra&#x27;s will not return, Batman oversees his nemesis&#x27; cremation.

===&quot;The Resurrection of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&quot;===
In &quot;Batman&quot; Annual #26, Talia is prompted to read the history of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul to her son Damian by a mysterious figure from Ra&#x27;s&#x27; past: the White Ghost. Unbeknownst to her, the White Ghost plans to use Damian as a vessel for Ra&#x27;s&#x27; return. However, mother and son escape before the plan is completed. After the escape, Batman confronts the White Ghost; he fights Batman, but accidentally falls into a Lazarus Pit.

As of &quot;Batman&quot; #670, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul has returned, having evaded death by transferring his consciousness into the body of another. Because his host body is decaying from radiation poisoning, he needs to transfer his mind into another host body. His first choice is that of his grandson Damian Wayne, but Damian escapes to alert his father.

Upon taking Ra&#x27;s to a &quot;Fountain of Essence&quot;, which contains the qualities of a Lazarus Pit, Batman is confronted with the sight of the Sensei, who is revealed to be Ra&#x27;s&#x27; father. After defeating Ra&#x27;s, Sensei fights and impales Batman with a cane. Determined to win, Batman drags the Sensei into the Fountain, where he is killed for not being a pure soul. Ra&#x27;s, meanwhile, has taken over the body of a Nanda Parbat monk and departs. Healed by the Fountain, Batman emerges and yells for Ra&#x27;s.

Ra&#x27;s attempts to make amends with Batman after his resurrection, but Batman responds by crushing his decaying fingers. Ra&#x27;s accepts this latest rebuke and, with the help of his men, overpowers Batman and captures Damian, who has arrived to try to help his father. Ra&#x27;s attempts to take over Damian, but Batman breaks free just as Robin, Talia, Alfred Pennyworth, and Nightwing arrive to save him. While the battle ensues at Nanda Parbat, the White Ghost takes Ra&#x27;s to a secluded place, where he appears to accept the fact that his death is inevitable. The White Ghost is revealed as Ra&#x27;s&#x27; estranged albino son Dusan, and offers up his own body instead. Ra&#x27;s performs the transfer of souls, but the White Ghost apparently dies soon afterward. Ra&#x27;s resumes the battle and attempts to kill Batman, but the monks at Nanda Parbat stop him and banish him from the temple.

Following his resurrection, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, in his new body, moves his base of operations to Gotham City where it is revealed that a remnant of his son Dusan&#x27;s consciousness still remains within him. Since the White Ghost was his son, Ra&#x27;s was able to use the resemblance between them to modify his new body&#x27;s appearance to be more like his own, though he remains an albino. This arrogance contributes to the brazen move to Gotham and a subsequent ninja attack on Batman, which indirectly leads to the discovery of a map of all the known Lazarus Pit locations across the globe. Batman then infiltrates Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s new Gotham penthouse headquarters and easily defeats his horde of ninjas and Ra&#x27;s himself. To ensure Ra&#x27;s is not a constant threat within Gotham City, Batman comes up with the false identity of &quot;Terry Gene Kase&quot;, and plants it along with credible photos, medical records, and police records for both Blackgate Penitentiary and Arkham Asylum. Batman takes an unconscious Ra&#x27;s directly to Arkham where it is believed he really is the prisoner &quot;Terry Gene Kase&quot;, a criminal with multiple personality disorder who has just been transferred to Arkham to finish out multiple life sentences. Along with attaching false information and a false identity to Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s file, Batman attaches a false prescription of potent medication that ensures slurred speech and next to zero mobility.

Despite these precautions, Ra&#x27;s eventually escapes when the orderlies miss his dosage once, which allows him to become conscious enough to escape from Arkham.

===The Return of Bruce Wayne===
Ra&#x27;s realizes that Batman has apparently died after Darkseid&#x27;s invasion during &quot;Final Crisis&quot;. After confronting Nightwing with his knowledge, he and the hero eventually duel with swords. Nightwing defeats Ra&#x27;s and earns the immortal&#x27;s respect, signified by leaving his sword in the Batcave as a gift after their fight. Ra&#x27;s refuses to believe his enemy&#x27;s passing despite the evidence, leading him to be involved in the Red Robin&#x27;s (Tim Drake) quest concerning the fate of the original Dark Knight. After Drake finds proof that Wayne is still alive but lost in time after his battle with Darkseid, the former Boy Wonder cripples Ra&#x27;s&#x27; organization, the League of Assassins, from within. In response, Ra&#x27;s returns to Gotham to begin his attack to destroy every legacy of the Wayne Family. While his men target everyone close to the Waynes, Ra&#x27;s makes a pact with Hush as part of his plans. Unknown to both men, Lucius Fox has already given Tim power of attorney leaving him in control of the Wayne Family resources.

Enraged, Ra&#x27;s then engages Tim Drake in combat, which ends with Tim mocking Ra&#x27;s by saying that there&#x27;s nothing he can do to harm the Bat Family anymore; in response, Ra&#x27;s smiles and says &quot;Well done. Detective&quot; (a name he has only ever reserved for Batman, Nightwing and Red Hood once before). He then proceeds to kick him out of a skyscraper window and retreats from the battle. Later, in seclusion, Ra&#x27;s reveals everything which happened was a test for Tim Drake, from the league, the council, the Men of Death, and the plot against Bruce Wayne.

Learning of Bruce Wayne&#x27;s return, Ra&#x27;s muses that his next confrontation with the detective will be particularly interesting as he believes that Batman has at last had a taste of the immortality that Ra&#x27;s himself enjoys.

He goes after Vicki Vale and almost kills her. He spares her life only after she refuses to publish the identity of Batman and gets rid of all of the evidence she has to that effect. He also realizes that Vale may be a descendant of a French opponent, Marcel du Valliere, from centuries before; therefore, his business with her may not be finished.

===The New 52===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Ra&#x27;s al Ghul appears in a hooded robe at the League of Assassins&#x27; city of &#x27;Eth Alth&#x27;eban. He enters the Well of Sins after an encounter with Jason Todd. When he emerges, Ra&#x27;s is consumed by the evil that corrupted the Untitled centuries before, and he feels compelled to rid himself of the machinations of his daughter and Ducra by killing Jason. At Ra&#x27;s&#x27; command, the prisoners are brought to him, and he promises to use his newfound power to destroy them. Red Hood engages Ra&#x27;s, as Essence joins the battle. She insists that he will allow Jason and his friends to leave his realm, or he will be forced to die a mortal death just as he always feared he would. Despite having destroyed the All-Caste, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s actions have led to their eventual rebirth. Defeated, he swears that he will visit great agony upon Red Hood if he ever sees him again.

Batman and Aquaman head to an island, where the League of Assassins are located, after Ra&#x27;s has the bodies of Damian Wayne and Talia exhumed. Ra&#x27;s had ordered the hunt of whales, creating genetically altered super-humans in the wombs of sperm whales, part of a plan to rebuild the League of Assassins. Inside the compound, they find that Ra&#x27;s is wiping the hard drives clean, preventing data recovery. As his parting gift, he has left Batman the Heretics to keep him entertained. Batman fights his way to Ra&#x27;s escape aircraft. He sees Talia and Damian&#x27;s bodies stored within it, and clings to the fuselage from outside as the plane takes off. Though Ra&#x27;s plans to go to Paradise Island, he is nearly surprised to see Batman pounding on the cockpit&#x27;s windshield. From outside, Batman screams for Ra&#x27;s to give back his son, but Ra&#x27;s responds that he is blood of Damian&#x27;s blood and the boy is in good hands. He orders the plane to tilt its angle, causing the wind shear to rip Batman from his purchase and drop down into the sea, where he is caught by Aquaman.

Batman and Ra&#x27;s then encounter Glorious Godfrey. Glorious Godfrey&#x27;s reason to come to Earth is to retrieve the Chaos Shard, a powerful crystal once belonged to Darkseid which Ra&#x27;s al Ghul revealed was hidden inside the sarcophagus he crafted for Damian.

During &quot;Batman Eternal&quot;, Bruce briefly speculates that Ra&#x27;s is the mastermind behind most of the attacks against him that have left Wayne Enterprises bankrupt and Batman pushed to the limit. However, when he confronts Ra&#x27;s, his foe reveals that, while he was invited to participate in the attack by the true mastermind, he rejected the offer as Ra&#x27;s would prefer to destroy Batman when the Dark Knight believes that his legacy will be as eternal as Ra&#x27;s, rather than tear him down in such a manner.

===DC Rebirth===
During &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul is featured in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; issues #953-956 as part of the &quot;League of Shadows&quot; story arc, which runs from issue #951-956 (April–July 2017).

Ra&#x27;s al Ghul appears in &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot; issue #2 as a member of the Immortals, a group formed by the oldest beings in the multiverse. He participates in a discussion on how they will fight the Dark Multiverse invasion.

==Abilities==
===Skills, training, and resources===
Due to his expanded life span, Ra&#x27;s has accumulated vast knowledge and abilities which exceed those of Batman. These include detective skills, chemistry, physics, military tactics, economics, and martial arts, fully using his photographic memory to master all such skills. He has also gained many international contacts and an immense fortune over the course of centuries. When in combat, he favors more ancient weaponry (as he has had more time to master them than more modern weaponry) these weapons include scimitars, katanas, spears, staffs, bolas, shurikens, smoke pellets and miniaturized explosives.

Ra&#x27;s&#x27; greatest tools are his green Lazarus Pits, which heal any injury including recent death and restore the user to the prime of life, but cause temporary insanity (or for those already insane like the Joker, sanity). His constant exposure to the pits has granted him slightly enhanced endurance, strength, and healing but also comes with the price of a gradual onset of insanity if overused.

===Magical and unnatural powers===
Along with his physical abilities and resources, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul has been shown to possess a certain degree of proficiency with mysticism. In an effort to guarantee his continued existence, he has on several occasions demonstrated the ability to transfer his soul into the bodies of others, giving him a way to live on in the event that his physical body is destroyed and unable to be transported into a Lazarus Pit. The exact details of this process have remained inconsistent; at times it appears as though a complicated ritual is required to achieve this effect, while on other occasions he is capable of performing this feat on a whim, merely by making physical contact with his intended host.

In the &quot;New 52&quot;, Ra&#x27;s temporarily gains vast magical powers after bathing in the Well of Sins, the first Lazarus Pit.

==Family==
The following are members of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s family:

===Sensei===
Created by Neal Adams in 1968, the Sensei was originally introduced as a high-ranking member of the League of Assassins. He was portrayed as an aged but highly skilled martial artist. During &quot;The Resurrection of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&quot;, he is revealed to be Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s centuries-old father and subsequently killed.

===Mother Soul===
Created by Joshua Williamson and Gleb Melnikov in 2021, Mother Soul is the mysterious head of the &quot;League of Lazarus&quot;. In Robin (vol. 3) #7, she is revealed to be Ruh al Ghul (Soul of the Demon), Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s mother.

===Nyssa Raatko===
Created by Greg Rucka and Klaus Janson in 2003, Nyssa Raatko () is Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s oldest known daughter. She was born the only child to Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s mistress Amina Raatko, also known as Lourdes in 18th century Russia. She would later become a Holocaust survivor. She is murdered by Cassandra Cain during the &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline.

===Dusan al Ghul===
Created by Peter Milligan and David Lopez in 2007, Dusan al Ghul () was Ra&#x27;s&#x27; only known son. He was also referred to as Ash&#x27;Shabah Al-Abyad (), meaning &quot;the White Ghost&quot;. Though little is known about his past, it is stated that he was born out of a union meant to strengthen his father&#x27;s hold over &quot;some long-extinct people&quot;, suggesting that he was older than Ra&#x27;s&#x27; other children. As an albino, he was never considered a potential heir to his father&#x27;s empire. He ultimately sacrificed himself to ensure his father&#x27;s survival during the Resurrection of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul storyline.

===Talia al Ghul===
Created by Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Bob Brown in 1971, Talia al Ghul () is Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s daughter. Like Ra&#x27;s, Talia&#x27;s mother was a woman of mixed Chinese and Arab ancestry named Melisande, who met Ra&#x27;s at the Woodstock festival.

===Damian Wayne===
Originally appearing as an unnamed infant in the 1987 graphic novel &quot;&quot;, the character was introduced as Damian Wayne or Damian al Ghul (Arabic: دميان الغول) by Grant Morrison and Andy Kubert in 2006. Damian is the son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul, making him the grandson of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. He is an Heir to the Demon Head and expected to one day lead the League. Ra&#x27;s raised him to be the new Alexander the Great. He is bred from birth to take and rule the world by his mother Talia al Ghul. He was very aggressive until he met his father, Batman. Batman taught him how to calm himself and trained him to be the new Robin. His genetic perfection marks him as the ideal host for his grandfather, who wants to take over his body.

===Mara al Ghul===
Created by Benjamin Percy and Jonboy Meyers, the character debuted in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 6) in December 2016. Mara al Ghul is a granddaughter of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, daughter to the late Dusan al Ghul and a cousin to Damian Wayne. Introduced as an enemy to Damian, she was also raised by the League of Assassins. She and Damian were both members of the &quot;Demon&#x27;s Fist&quot;, an elite group within the League. Damian was supposed to lead the Demon&#x27;s Fist, but Mara now leads the group instead since Damian chose to side with his father over the League. Mara hates Damian after he left her with a scar across her right eye during a training session when they were younger. Mara has not inherited her father&#x27;s albinism; she has black hair with red bangs. Like the rest of her family she is a skilled fighter, and is also noted to be a talented artist.

===Athanasia al Ghul===
Athanasia al Ghul is a character featured in the &quot;Injustice 2&quot; prequel comics and does not appear in the Prime Earth continuity. She is the daughter of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul, sister of Damian Wayne and granddaughter of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. Athanasia is the secret daughter of Talia and Bruce and raised by Talia without Bruce or even Damian&#x27;s knowledge. While Talia allowed Damian to become a hero and work with his father for a time, Talia kept Athanasia a secret from her father and raised her as a member of the League of Assassins.

===Others===
Although he fathered children with several women, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul has only two confirmed marriages. The first was to Sora, whose death set Ra&#x27;s on the path to becoming the &quot;Demon&#x27;s Head&quot;. The second was to Melisande, Talia&#x27;s mother.

Ra&#x27;s also appears to have an unnamed sister or half-sister, a female assassin belonging to a group called the &quot;Daughters of Acheron&quot;, whose members share the same father. Another member is a woman using the alias &quot;Promise&quot;. It is unclear if their common father, &quot;Acheron&quot;, is in fact the Sensei (making them all Ra&#x27;s&#x27; half-sisters) or if Ra&#x27;s only has one half-sister on his mother&#x27;s side.

In &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; #12, it is revealed that Talia has cloned her son, Damian who&#x27;s known as &quot;The Heretic&quot; The clone is, therefore, a grandson of sorts of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. Additionally, Nyssa once stated that she has given birth twelve times (only two of her children, Daniel and Hannah, are named), opening the possibility of Ra&#x27;s having many other descendants, although most of Nyssa&#x27;s family are murdered by the Nazis and Nyssa believes that her great-grandson Vasily (a Russian soldier who is reported to have been killed in the Middle East) was the last of her line.

&quot;The Birth of the Demon&quot; features Ra&#x27;s&#x27; uncle, who helps him avenge his wife and found the League of Assassins before they go their separate ways.

==Involvement with Batman==
After Talia encounters and falls in love with Batman in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #411 (May 1971), Ra&#x27;s begins to consider Batman a possible heir. Ra&#x27;s first deduces Batman&#x27;s secret identity when he reasons the Dark Knight has to be rich, and learns only Bruce Wayne has bought the equipment a crime fighter would have; he is then ready to put Batman to a final test.

Ra&#x27;s surprises Batman in the Batcave, seemingly to enlist Batman&#x27;s aid in rescuing both Talia and Dick Grayson, the first Robin, both of whom have apparently been kidnapped. Batman soon discovers the whole affair is a charade orchestrated by Ra&#x27;s to test Batman, which he passes. Ra&#x27;s asks Batman to become his heir, which Batman refuses, appalled by his genocidal plan to &quot;cleanse&quot; the world. This story was later adapted into a two-part story in &quot;&quot; during its first season under the title &quot;The Demon&#x27;s Quest&quot;.

Despite being mortal enemies, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul and Batman maintain some level of respect towards one another. Similar to The Riddler, Ra&#x27;s admires Batman&#x27;s intellectual prowess first and foremost, regularly referring to Batman as &quot;Detective&quot; or &quot;The Detective&quot; when speaking to or about him. Despite being aware of Batman&#x27;s true identity as Bruce Wayne since their first meeting, Ra&#x27;s has never exposed that information to the public or Batman&#x27;s other foes; Batman once attributed this to Ra&#x27;s&#x27; personal code of honor, though Ra&#x27;s has repeatedly used that knowledge to his own advantage when fomenting plans and contingencies against Batman.

In the story &quot;Resurrection Night&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #400, Ra&#x27;s helps all of Batman&#x27;s foes to escape from Arkham Asylum and the Gotham State Penitentiary, setting them on a plan to abduct certain individuals across Gotham City who are linked in one form or another to Batman. Ra&#x27;s&#x27; true intent is to show Batman the folly of his efforts to protect a corrupt society which, to his mind, allows criminals to exist and flourish. Ra&#x27;s eventually uses the Pit while still healthy, both increasing his strength and putting his life at risk, in an attempt to outmatch the Dark Knight. The plan backfires, as Ra&#x27;s is left writhing in the pit, seemingly destroyed.

In Chip Zdarsky&#x27;s 2022 limited series &quot;&quot; set in the DC Prime Earth (the mainline DC continuity post-&quot;Flashpoint&quot;) continuity, Ra&#x27;s, as well as Talia, are rewritten to have first met Bruce prior to him becoming Batman, with Ra&#x27;s being Bruce&#x27;s final mentor in his journey to become Batman. Ra&#x27;s meets Bruce and his companion Minkhoa Khan, the future vigilante Ghost-Maker, on their travels and tells him that he is trying to save the world like they are, although Bruce quickly turns distrustful of Ra&#x27;s as he soon finds that Ra&#x27;s trains assassins. Like his original origin, Ra&#x27;s christens Bruce as his right hand man, though this time he does so after Bruce defeats Minkhoa in combat. Ra&#x27;s later reveals to Bruce his true intentions to use missiles to bomb numerous cities around the world, but Bruce reveals to Ra&#x27;s that Minkhoa had already discovered them and told Bruce about them during their fight, which allowed Bruce to destroy the League&#x27;s arsenal before Ra&#x27;s could use them to harm innocents. Bruce fights Ra&#x27;s and defeats him, but Ra&#x27;s is rescued by Talia, who stabs Bruce and escapes with Ra&#x27;s to parts unknown. Minkhoa rescues Bruce and leaves him the desert, which leads to Bruce returning home to Gotham City and becoming the Batman.

* An alternate universe variant of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul appears in &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot;. This version forced Batman to aid him in an experiment that would allow a person to gain apparently permanent immortality from a Lazarus Pit; two souls enter the same Pit, but one would perish and another become immortal, with no way to know which would survive. With Bruce now in his late seventies and alone in Ra&#x27;s&#x27;s base, he agreed to the proposal, which led to Ra&#x27;s dying in the Pit and Bruce being restored to the prime of his life, with an immortality that means he is eventually aging one year physically for every century chronologically. Bruce subsequently uses Ra&#x27;s&#x27;s resources to create an international humanitarian network, essentially turning his criminal empire into a force for good so subtly that most of the former workers believe it was a front for some future scheme before the front becomes the true organisation.

<text>In the 1920 Manitoba general election, a heterogenous grouping of &quot;Farmer&quot; candidates took 12 seats. Together they made up the second-largest caucus in the Legislature. Some of them went on to found the United Farmers of Manitoba in 1922.

In the 1930 federal election in Canada, five supporters of the United Farmers ran in Saskatchewan as &quot;Farmer&quot; candidates. None of them were elected. Additionally, in the 1925 federal election, one supporter of the Progressive Party of Canada ran in Quebec as a &quot;Farmer&quot; candidate.

<doc id="481629" wikidata="Q587621" url="?curid=481629" title="Trebatius Testa">
<text>Gaius Trebatius Testa (C.84 BC-AD 4, fl. 1st century BC,) was a jurist of ancient Rome, whose family, and himself, originated from Elea.

==Friendship with Cicero and the Caesars==

Some twenty years younger than Cicero, Trebatius was both a familiar friend and a protégé of the latter. Cicero dedicated his &quot;Topica&quot; to Trebatius, and recommended Trebatius as a legal advisor to Julius Caesar, calling him a thorough gentleman and a &quot;leading light in civil law&quot;. Trebatius enjoyed Caesar&#x27;s favor, making his fortune alongside him in Gaul, and supporting him in the Civil War.

Later he also worked closely with Augustus, and was subsequently described in the Institutes of Justinian as being of the greatest authority for Augustan law.

==Character==
A good-humoured man - Cicero wrote of sending him &quot;badinage in your own style&quot; - Trebatius was featured by Horace as a learned adviser in his &quot;Satires&quot;. As well as a fondness for wine, Trebatius also seemed to enjoy swimming as a hobby. 

==Legal career and influence==

A pupil of Cornelius Maximus, Trebatius played a key part in the transfer of legal authority from the senate to individual jurisconsults under the Principate.

An expert on sacral law, Trebatius&#x27; writings included a &quot;de religionibus&quot; and &quot;de iure civili&quot;, but not even excerpts of these survive. He was, however, frequently cited by later jurists, and also had a high reputation as the teacher of Marcus Antistius Labeo.

<doc id="481634" wikidata="Q202589" url="?curid=481634" title="Cillian Murphy">
<text>Cillian Murphy ( ; born 25 May 1976) is an Irish actor. His works encompass both stage and screen, and his accolades include an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award.

He made his professional debut in Enda Walsh&#x27;s 1996 play &quot;Disco Pigs&quot;, a role he later reprised in the 2001 screen adaptation. His early film credits include the horror film &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002), the dark comedy &quot;Intermission&quot; (2003), the thriller &quot;Red Eye&quot; (2005), the Irish war drama &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot; (2006), and the science fiction thriller &quot;Sunshine&quot; (2007). He played a transgender Irish woman in the comedy-drama &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot; (2005), which earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination.

Murphy began his collaboration with filmmaker Christopher Nolan in 2005, playing the Scarecrow in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; trilogy (2005–2012) as well as appearing in &quot;Inception&quot; (2010) and &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (2017). He gained greater prominence for his role as Tommy Shelby in the BBC period drama series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; (2013–2022) and for starring in the horror sequel &quot;A Quiet Place Part II&quot; (2020). Murphy portrayed J. Robert Oppenheimer in Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

In 2011, Murphy won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance for the one-man play &quot;Misterman&quot;. In 2020, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; named him one of the greatest Irish film actors of all time.

== Early life and education ==
Murphy was born on 25 May 1976 in Douglas, Cork. His mother taught French while his father, Brendan, worked for the Department of Education. His grandfather, aunts, and uncles were also teachers. He was raised in Ballintemple, Cork, alongside his younger brother Páidi and younger sisters Sile and Orla. He started writing and performing songs at the age of 10.

Murphy was raised Catholic and attended the fee-paying Catholic secondary school Presentation Brothers College, where he did well academically but often got into trouble, sometimes being suspended; he decided in his fourth year that misbehaving was not worth the hassle. Not keen on sports, which was a major part of the school&#x27;s curriculum, he found that artistic pursuits were neglected at the school.

Murphy got his first taste of performing in secondary school when he participated in a drama module presented by Corcadorca Theatre Company director Pat Kiernan. He later described the experience as a &quot;huge high&quot; and a &quot;fully alive&quot; feeling that he then set out to chase. Novelist William Wall, who was his English teacher, encouraged him to pursue acting but he was set on becoming a rock star. In his late teens and early 20s, he sang and played the guitar in several bands alongside his brother, Páidi, and the Beatles-obsessed duo named their most successful band The Sons of Mr. Green Genes, which they adopted from the Frank Zappa song of the same name. He later said the band &quot;specialised in wacky lyrics and endless guitar solos&quot;. They were offered a five-album deal by Acid Jazz Records, which they rejected because Páidi was still in school and the duo did not agree with the small amount of money they would get for giving the record label the rights to Murphy&#x27;s compositions. Murphy later confessed, &quot;I&#x27;m very glad in retrospect that we didn&#x27;t sign because you kind of sign away your life to a label and the whole of your music.&quot;

Murphy began studying law at University College Cork (UCC) in 1996 but failed his first-year exams because he &quot;had no ambitions to do it&quot;. Not only was he busy with his band, but he knew within days after starting at UCC that he did not want to practise law. After seeing Corcadorca&#x27;s stage production of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, directed by Kiernan, he began directing his attention to acting. His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society&#x27;s amateur production of &quot;Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme&quot;, which starred Irish-American comedian Des Bishop. Murphy also played the lead in their production of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, which was performed in the Cork Opera House. He later admitted that his primary motivation at the time was not to pursue an acting career, but to go to parties and meet women.

==Career==
===1996–2002: Theatre work and early roles===
Murphy pressured Pat Kiernan until he got an audition at Corcadorca Theatre Company, and in September 1996, he made his professional acting debut on the stage, playing the part of a volatile Cork teenager in Enda Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Disco Pigs&quot;. Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: &quot;There was something about him – he was incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and you&#x27;d go, &quot;My God&quot;. It had nothing to do with those bloody eyes that everyone&#x27;s going on about all the time.&quot; Murphy observed, &quot;I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose&quot;. Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, &quot;Disco Pigs&quot; ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university and his band. Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of &quot;Disco Pigs&quot;, and his acting career began to take off.

He starred in many other theatre productions, including Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1998), &quot;The Country Boy,&quot; and &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; (both 1999). He began appearing in independent films such as &quot;On the Edge&quot; (2001), and in short films, including &quot;Filleann an Feall&quot; (2000) and &quot;Watchmen&quot; (2001). He also reprised his role for the film adaption of &quot;Disco Pigs&quot; (2001) and appeared in the BBC television mini-series adaptation of &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot;. During this period, he moved from Cork, relocating first to Dublin for a few years, then to London in 2001. In 2002, Murphy starred as Adam in a theatre production of Neil LaBute&#x27;s &quot;The Shape of Things&quot; at the Gate Theatre in Dublin. Writing for &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, Fintan O&#x27;Toole praised Murphy&#x27;s performance, &quot;Murphy measures out his metamorphosis with an impressive subtlety and intelligence&quot;.

===2002–2004: &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and breakthrough===
Murphy was cast in the lead role in Danny Boyle&#x27;s horror film &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002). He portrayed pandemic survivor Jim, who is &quot;perplexed to find himself alone in the desolate, post-apocalyptic world&quot; after waking from a coma in a London hospital. Casting director Gail Stevens suggested that Boyle audition Murphy for the role, having been impressed with his performance in &quot;Disco Pigs&quot;. Stevens stated that it was only after seeing his slender physique during filming that they decided to feature him fully nude at the beginning of the film. She recalled that Murphy was shy on set with the tendency to look slightly away from the camera, but enthused that he had a &quot;dreamy, slightly de-energised, floating quality that is fantastic for the film&quot;. Released in the UK in late 2002, by the following July, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; had become a sleeper hit in North America, and success worldwide, putting Murphy in front of a mass audience for the first time. His performance earned him a nomination for Best Newcomer at the 8th Empire Awards, and Breakthrough Male Performance at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards. Murphy professed that he considered the film to be much deeper than a zombie or horror film, expressing surprise at the film&#x27;s success, and that American audiences responded well to its content and violence. Murphy said, &quot;The film did so well. And you watch zombie stuff [now], we were the first people to make zombies run, and [that] changed everything. It has a very special place in my heart, that movie.&quot;

In 2003, Murphy played the role of Konstantine in a stage production of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; at the Edinburgh International Festival. He said that he wanted to play Konstantine because the character &quot;goes on this amazing journey through the play [...] he comes to realise there&#x27;s no point being an iconoclastic writer just for the sake of it, and that the search for new forms has to have something behind it&quot;.

Murphy starred as a lovelorn, hapless supermarket stocker who plots a bank heist with Colin Farrell in &quot;Intermission&quot; (2003), which became the highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box office history (until &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot; broke the record in 2006). Reflecting on his roles in &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and the &quot;sad-sack Dublin shelf-stacker&quot; in &quot;Intermission&quot;, Sarah Lyall of the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; stated that Murphy brought &quot;fluent ease to the roles he takes on, a graceful and wholly believable intensity. His delicate good looks have, as much as his acting prowess, caused people to mark him as Ireland&#x27;s next Colin Farrell, albeit one who seems less likely to be caught tomcatting around or brawling drunkenly at premieres.&quot; He had a minor supporting role in the successful Hollywood period drama &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; (2003). He portrayed a deserting soldier who shares a grim scene with Jude Law&#x27;s character, and was on location in Romania for only a week. Murphy stated that it was a &quot;massive production&quot;, remarking that director Anthony Minghella was the calmest director he&#x27;d ever met. Murphy also had a role as a butcher in &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; (2003) with Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.

In 2004, Murphy toured Ireland with the Druid Theatre Company, in &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; (playing the character of Christy Mahon) under the direction of Garry Hynes—who had previously directed Murphy back in 1999 in the theatre productions of &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot;—and also in &quot;The Country Boy&quot;.

===2005–2006: Villainous roles and critical success===

Murphy appeared as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005). Originally asked to audition for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, Murphy never saw himself as having the right physique for the superhero, but leapt at the chance to connect with director Nolan. Though the lead went to Christian Bale, Nolan was so impressed with Murphy that he gave him the supporting role of Dr. Crane, whose alter ego is supervillain Scarecrow. Nolan told &quot;Spin&quot; magazine, &quot;He has the most extraordinary eyes, and I kept trying to invent excuses for him to take his glasses off in close-ups&quot;. He starred as Jackson Rippner, who terrorises Rachel McAdams on an overnight flight in Wes Craven&#x27;s thriller, &quot;Red Eye&quot; (2005). &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Manohla Dargis asserted that Murphy made &quot;a picture-perfect villain&quot; and that his &quot;baby blues look cold enough to freeze water and his wolfish leer suggests its own terrors&quot;. The film was favourably reviewed and earned almost $100 million worldwide.

Murphy received several awards nominations for his 2005 villainous roles, among them a nomination as Best Villain at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards for &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked him among its 2005 &quot;Summer MVPs&quot;, a cover story list of 10 entertainers with outstanding breakthrough performances. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s David Denby wrote: &quot;Cillian Murphy, who has angelic looks that can turn sinister, is one of the most elegantly seductive monsters in recent movies.&quot;

Murphy starred as Patrick/&quot;Kitten&quot; Braden, a transgender Irish woman in search of her mother, in Neil Jordan&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot; (2005), based on the novel of the same title by Patrick McCabe. Seen against the film&#x27;s kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s glitter rock fashion, magic shows, red-light districts and IRA violence, Murphy transforms from androgynous teen to a blonde drag queen. He had auditioned for the role in 2001 and, though Jordan liked him for the part, the director of &quot;The Crying Game&quot; was hesitant to revisit transgender and IRA issues. The actor lobbied Jordan for several years in a bid to get the film made before Murphy became too old to play the part; in 2004, he prepared for the role by meeting a transvestite who dressed him and took him clubbing with other transvestites. The role required &quot;serious primping&quot; with eyebrow plucking and chest and leg hair removal, and Roger Ebert noted the way that Murphy played the character with a &quot;bemused and hopeful voice&quot;. While lukewarm reviews of &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot; tended to praise Murphy&#x27;s performance highly, a few critics dissented: &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, which panned the film, found him &quot;unconvincing&quot; and overly cute. Murphy was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot; and won the fourth Irish Film and Television Academy Best Actor Award. &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine cited his performance as Kitten in their &quot;The 24 Finest Performances of 2005&quot; feature.

In 2006, Murphy starred in &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot;, a film about the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War, which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and became the most successful Irish independent film at the Irish box office. Murphy was especially keen on appearing in the film due to his intimate connections to Cork, Ireland, where the film was shot. Murphy auditioned six times for the role of Damien O&#x27;Donovan, a young doctor turned revolutionary, before winning the part. Murphy considered it a very special privilege to have been given the role and stated that he was &quot;tremendously proud&quot; of the film, remarking that the &quot;memories run very, very deep – the politics, the divisions and everybody has stories of family members who were caught up in the struggle.&quot; David Denby noted Murphy&#x27;s moments of deep stillness and idiosyncrasies in portraying the character. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Murphy is especially good at playing the zealotry as well as the soul-searching and the regret, at showing us a man who is eaten up alive because he&#x27;s forced to act in ways that are contrary to his background and his training&quot;. &quot;GQ&quot; magazine presented Murphy with its 2006 Actor of the Year award for his work in &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot;.

===2006–2012: Further theatre and film roles===

Murphy returned to the stage starring opposite Neve Campbell at the New Ambassadors Theatre in London&#x27;s West End from November 2006 to February 2007, playing the lead role of John Kolvenbach&#x27;s play &quot;Love Song&quot;. &quot;Theatre Record&quot; described his character of Beane as a &quot;winsomely cranky&quot; mentally unstable &quot;sentimentalised lonely hero&quot;, noting how he magnetically, with &quot;all blue eyes and twitching hands&quot;, moves &quot;comically from painfully shy &quot;wallpaper&quot; to garrulous, amorous male. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine considered his performance to be &quot;as magnetic onstage as onscreen&quot;, remarking that his &quot;unhurried puzzlement pulls the slight preciousness in the character&#x27;s idiot-savant naivete back from the brink&quot;.

He starred in the science fiction film &quot;Sunshine&quot; (2007) as a physicist-astronaut charged with re-igniting the sun, also directed by Danny Boyle. He starred opposite Lucy Liu in Paul Soter&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; (2007); the indie film premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival and was released direct-to-DVD. Murphy starred as Richard Neville, editor of the psychedelic radical underground magazine &quot;Oz&quot; in the film &quot;Hippie Hippie Shake&quot;, which was filmed in 2007, but the project, much delayed, was eventually shelved in 2011.

Murphy made a brief re-appearance as the Scarecrow in Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008), the sequel to &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, before starring in &quot;The Edge of Love&quot;—about a love quadrangle involving the poet Dylan Thomas—with Keira Knightley, Sienna Miller and Matthew Rhys. In July 2008, Murphy made a debut appearance in another medium—on a postage stamp; the Irish Post Office, An Post, released a series of four stamps paying homage to the creativity of films recently produced in Ireland, including one featuring Murphy in a still from &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot;. In 2009, Murphy starred opposite rock singer Feist and actor David Fox in &quot;The Water&quot;, directed by Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene. The 15-minute Canadian short film, released online in April 2009, is nearly silent until the Feist song of the same title plays close to the end. Murphy was attracted to the role as a fan of Broken Social Scene and the prospect of making a silent movie, which he considered to be the &quot;hardest test for any actor&quot;. Murphy also starred in &quot;Perrier&#x27;s Bounty&quot;, a crime dramedy from the makers of &quot;Intermission&quot;, in which he portrayed a petty criminal on the run from a gangster played by Brendan Gleeson.

In 2010, he made a return to theatre in &quot;From Galway to Broadway and back again&quot;, which was a stage show that celebrated the Druid Theatre Company&#x27;s 35th birthday. The direct-to-video psychological thriller &quot;Peacock&quot; (2010), co-starring Elliot Page, Susan Sarandon and Bill Pullman, starred Murphy as a man with a split personality who fools people into believing he is also his own wife. Christian Toto of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; referred to the film as &quot;a handsomely mounted psychological drama with an arresting lead turn by Cillian Murphy&quot;, and noted that although Murphy wasn&#x27;t a stranger to playing in drag, his work in the film set a &quot;new standard for gender-bending performances&quot;. Murphy next starred in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Inception&quot; (2010), playing entrepreneur Robert Fischer, whose mind is infiltrated by DiCaprio&#x27;s character Cobb to convince him to dissolve his business. That year, Murphy also made an uncredited cameo as programmer Edward Dillinger Jr., son of original &quot;Tron&quot; antagonist Ed Dillinger (David Warner) in &quot;&quot;.

In 2011, Murphy performed in the stage monodrama &quot;Misterman&quot;, written and directed by Enda Walsh, with whom he had previously worked on &quot;Disco Pigs&quot;. The production was initially staged in Galway and was taken to St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York. Murphy said of the role, &quot;The live nature of it makes it so dangerous. You&#x27;re only there because of the goodwill of the audience, and that&#x27;s compounded by its being a one-man show.&quot; His performance earned critical acclaim, garnering Irish Times Theatre Award and a Drama Desk Award. Sarah Lyall of the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; described Murphy&#x27;s character Thomas Magill to be a &quot;complicated mixture of sympathetic and not nice at all – deeply wounded, but with a dangerous, skewed moral code&quot;, praising his ability to mimic wickedly. Lyall noted Murphy&#x27;s &quot;unusual ability to create and inhabit creepy yet fascinating characters from the big screen to the small stage in the intense one-man show &quot;Misterman&quot;&quot;, and documented that on one evening the &quot;theatre was flooded, not with applause but with silence&quot;, eventually culminating in a standing ovation at his powerful performance. He played the lead in the British horror film &quot;Retreat&quot; (2011), which had a limited release. He also appeared in the science fiction film &quot;In Time&quot; (2011), starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, which was poorly reviewed.

Murphy starred in &quot;Red Lights&quot; (2012) with Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver. He played Tom Buckley, the assistant to Weaver&#x27;s character who is a paranormal investigator. Murphy considered working with De Niro to have been one of the most intimidating moments in his career. He remarked: &quot;My first scene when I come to visit him my character is supposed to be terrified and intimidated. There was no acting involved. The man has presence. You can&#x27;t act presence. I&#x27;ll never have that. Watching him use it... when you put a camera on it, it just becomes something else.&quot; The film was panned by critics and under-performed at the box office. Murphy went on to reprise his role as the Scarecrow for the third time in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), and had a supporting role as Mike in the British independent film &quot;Broken&quot; (2012). His performance earned him a British Independent Film Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination.

===2013–present: &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; and &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;===

Beginning in 2013, Murphy starred as Thomas Shelby in the BBC television series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;, a series about a criminal gang in Birmingham during the post-World War I period. Jason Statham was initially picked for the role by director Steven Knight, who met both actors to talk about the role. Knight later said, &quot;Cillian, when you meet him, isn&#x27;t Tommy, obviously, but I was stupid enough not to understand that&quot;. He picked Murphy after receiving a text message from Murphy that read, &quot;Remember, I&#x27;m an actor&quot;. Murphy told &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;[The scripts] were so compelling and confident, and the character was so rich and complex, layered and contradictory. I was like, &#x27;I have to do this.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; was praised and received high ratings. A second series began broadcasting on the BBC in October 2014. On 25 August 2019, the first episode of season 5 was broadcast on BBC One. In an interview with Digital Spy, director Anthony Byrne said, &quot;if we did start shooting in January (2021), we wouldn&#x27;t finish until May or June and then it&#x27;s another 6 months of editing&quot;. Series six premiered on 27 February 2022.

In 2013, Murphy made his directorial debut with a music video for the band Money&#x27;s single &quot;Hold Me Forever&quot;. The video features dancers from the English National Ballet and was filmed at The Old Vic Theatre in London. In 2014, Murphy starred in the drama &quot;Aloft&quot;, and Wally Pfister&#x27;s &quot;Transcendence&quot;. Both of these garnered mostly unfavourable critic reviews according to the aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. That same year, Murphy reunited with Enda Walsh in the play &quot;Ballyturk&quot;. He starred in Ron Howard&#x27;s 2015 film &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot;. In 2015, he contributed spoken vocals to the tracks &quot;8:58&quot; and &quot;The Clock&quot; from Paul Hartnoll&#x27;s album &quot;8:58&quot;. The two previously met while Hartnoll was scoring the second season of &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;. In 2016, Murphy starred in Ben Wheatley&#x27;s &quot;Free Fire&quot;, and portrayed Czechoslovak World War II army soldier Jozef Gabčík, who was involved in Operation Anthropoid, the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in &quot;Anthropoid&quot;. Rupert Hawksley of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; believed Cillian&#x27;s performance in &quot;Anthropoid&quot;, but opined that he is &quot;not asked to do an awful lot, other than smoke and look perplexed&quot;.

In 2017, Murphy played a shell-shocked army officer who is recovered from a wrecked ship in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s war film &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, which emerged as a critical and box-office success. He felt that his character, who is nameless and was credited simply as Shivering Soldier, was &quot;representative of something experienced by thousands of soldiers, which is the profound emotional and psychological toll that war can have&quot;. Murphy has also played a role in the feature film &quot;Anna&quot; as Miller, released in June 2019. His next release, &quot;A Quiet Place Part II&quot; (2021), stars Murphy as Emmett, a hardened survivor and old family friend of the Abbotts. Murphy&#x27;s character reluctantly takes in the Abbotts following the events of the first film. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised his performance.
Since 2020, Murphy has hosted &quot;Cillian Murphy&#x27;s Limited Edition&quot;, a limited-run radio series broadcasting on BBC Radio 6 Music in which he draws from his personal music collection and answers &quot;reasonable questions&quot; from listeners. As of 2024, three seasons of &quot;Limited Edition&quot; have been produced, totalling 28 episodes.

Murphy portrayed J. Robert Oppenheimer in the biographical thriller &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;. The film marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. To prepare for the role, Murphy lost a significant amount of weight to match Oppenheimer&#x27;s near-emaciated appearance, extensively researched Oppenheimer&#x27;s life and took inspiration from David Bowie&#x27;s appearance in the 1970s. Released in 2023, the film grossed over $975 million worldwide and garnered positive reviews from critics. Murphy&#x27;s performance was lauded, with &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s Dan Jolin writing: &quot;At the film&#x27;s pulsing nucleus is Murphy as Oppenheimer, and he is compelling throughout.&quot; For his performance, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, and Academy Award for Best Actor.

Murphy launched the independent production company Big Things Films with Alan Moloney in February 2024. He produced and starred in the historical drama &quot;Small Things like These&quot;, which opened the 74th Berlin International Film Festival, and the upcoming drama film &quot;Steve&quot;, through a collaboration with Netflix. Murphy will also star in and executive produce two sequels to &quot;28 Days Later&quot;, titled &quot;28 Years Later&quot; and &quot;28 Years Later: The Bone Temple&quot;. Additionally, Murphy will reprise his role as Shelby in the film &quot;The Immortal Man&quot;, which will serve as a continuation of the &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; series.

==Public image==
Reserved and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene, finding the red carpet experience &quot;a challenge&quot; that he does not &quot;want to overcome&quot;. He intentionally practises a lifestyle that will not interest the tabloids, stating, &quot;I haven&#x27;t created any controversy, I don&#x27;t sleep around, I don&#x27;t go and fall down drunk&quot;. He prefers not to speak about his life outside of acting and did not appear on any television talk shows until 2010, when he was a guest on Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Late Late Show&quot; to promote &quot;Perrier&#x27;s Bounty&quot;, though he still remained reserved. Murphy&#x27;s introverted nature and lack of interest in social media has prompted several fans to create memes on his detached demeanour in press interviews and junkets. In 2017, upon being asked his opinion on the &quot;Disappointed Cillian Murphy&quot; meme, he answered, &quot;What&#x27;s a meme?&quot;.

In 2015, Murphy was named one of &quot;GQ&quot;″s 50 best-dressed men, and in 2024, he was announced as the new face of Italian luxury fashion company Versace. He is also known to be an unconventional sex symbol.

==Activism==
Murphy participated in the 2007 Rock the Vote Ireland campaign, targeting young voters for the general election, and campaigning for the rights of the homeless with the organisation Focus Ireland. In 2011, he became a patron of the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre at the National University of Ireland Galway. He is closely associated with the work of Professor Pat Dolan Director UCFRC and UNESCO Chair in Children, Youth and Civic Engagement. In February 2012, he wrote a message of support to the former Vita Cortex workers involved in a sit-in at their plant, congratulating them for &quot;highlighting [what] is hugely important to us all as a nation&quot;. Murphy was a supporter of the 2018 Irish referendum to repeal the eighth amendment of the constitution that restricted access to abortions, appearing on &quot;The Blindboy Podcast&quot; to urge men to support women and vote in favour of the referendum.

==Personal life==
In 2004, Murphy married his longtime girlfriend Yvonne McGuinness, whom he met at one of his rock band&#x27;s shows in 1996. They lived in Dublin until 2001 when they moved to London so his wife could attend the Royal College of Art. After 14 years, they moved back to Dublin in 2015. They have two sons, born in 2005 and 2007.

Murphy was raised Catholic. He stated that he had been verging on agnosticism until his role as a physicist and astronaut in the 2007 film &quot;Sunshine&quot;, at which point his views shifted towards atheism. In 2019, he said the Catholic faith still shaped his morality.

He was a vegetarian for around 15 years, which he said happened because he was &quot;worried about getting mad cow disease&quot; rather than a moral decision. He also had qualms about unhealthy agribusiness practices. He began eating meat again to bulk up for his role in &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;. In a 2022 interview, he said he had returned to vegetarianism.

==Acting credits and awards==
Murphy&#x27;s most commercially successful films have been his many collaborations with Nolan, including &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, &quot;Inception&quot;, &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, and &quot;Dunkirk&quot;. Following the success of &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; and the Barbenheimer phenomenon, Murphy was named in &quot;Variety&quot; list of the most influential figures of 2023 in the entertainment and media industry. Murphy&#x27;s works also include other critically acclaimed films, such as &quot;A Quiet Place II&quot; and &quot;The Wind that Shakes the Barley&quot;. He has received several accolades over the course of his career, including four Irish Film &amp; Television Awards, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award.

<text>The North American Central Time Zone (CT) is a time zone in parts of Canada, the United States, Mexico, Central America, and a few Caribbean islands.

In parts of that zone (20 states in the US, three provinces or territories in Canada, and several border municipalities in Mexico), the Central Time Zone is affected by two time designations yearly: Central Standard Time (CST) is observed from the first Sunday in November to the second Sunday in March. It is six hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and designated internationally as UTC−6. From the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November the same areas observe daylight saving time (DST), creating the designation of Central Daylight Time (CDT), which is five hours behind UTC and known internationally as UTC−5.

==Regions using Central Time==

===Canada===

The province of Manitoba is the only province or territory in Canada that observes Central Time in all areas.

The following Canadian provinces and territories observe Central Time in the areas noted, while their other areas observe Eastern Time:
* Nunavut (territory): western areas (most of Kivalliq Region and part of Qikiqtaaluk Region)
* Ontario (province): a portion of the northwest bordering southeastern Manitoba, in and around Kenora.

Also, most of the province of Saskatchewan is on Central Standard Time year-round, never adjusting for Daylight Saving Time. One major exception includes Lloydminster, a city whose borders overlap both Alberta and Saskatchewan. The city charter stipulates that it shall observe Mountain Time and DST, putting the community on the same time as all of Alberta (UTC−7) in the winter, and in time with Saskatchewan (UTC−6) during the summer.

===United States===
Ten states are contained entirely in the Central Time Zone:
* Alabama
* Arkansas
* Illinois
* Iowa
* Louisiana
* Minnesota
* Mississippi
* Missouri
* Oklahoma
* Wisconsin

Five states are split between the Central Time Zone and the Mountain Time Zone:
* Kansas: all except for Sherman, Wallace, Greeley, and Hamilton counties
* Nebraska: eastern two thirds including the east part of Cherry County
* North Dakota: all except for southwest regions, south part of McKenzie County, and the majority of Dunn County and far western Sioux County
* South Dakota: eastern half including part of Stanley County
* Texas: all except for El Paso, Hudspeth, and northwestern Culberson counties

Five states are split between the Central Time Zone and the Eastern Time Zone:
* Florida: Florida panhandle west of the Apalachicola River; Franklin County west of the Apalachicola River and the northern parts of Gulf County are in the Central Time Zone
* Indiana: Northwest Indiana and most of Southwestern Indiana, including the Evansville metropolitan area
* Kentucky: the western portion of the state, including its three major cities: Bowling Green, Owensboro and Paducah
* Michigan: The four Upper Peninsula counties bordering Wisconsin: Gogebic, Iron, Dickinson, and Menominee counties
* Tennessee: West Tennessee and Middle Tennessee, including the major cities of Nashville, Memphis, and Clarksville
Additionally, Phenix City, Alabama, and several nearby communities in Russell County, Alabama, unofficially observe Eastern Time. This is due to their close proximity to Columbus, Georgia, which is on Eastern Time.

Although legally located within the Central Time Zone, Kenton, Oklahoma—located to the adjacent east of the defined border of the Central and Mountain time zones (at the Oklahoma−New Mexico state line)—unofficially observes Mountain Time. This is reportedly because most people who interact with the town reside in either New Mexico or Colorado.

===Mexico===

Most of Mexico—roughly the eastern three-fourths—lies in the Central Time Zone, except for five northwestern states (Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, Sonora, and most of Nayarit) and one southeastern state (Quintana Roo). It is known locally as the &quot;Zona Centro&quot;.

The federal entities of Mexico that observe Central Time:

* Aguascalientes
* Campeche
* Chihuahua – Excluding the municipalities of Janos, Ascensión, Juárez, Guadalupe, and Práxedis Gilberto Guerrero, which observe Mountain Time with DST. Additionally, counties east of Guadalupe observe Daylight Savings in Central Time.
* Coahuila
* Colima – except for the Revillagigedo Islands, in which the inner islands use UTC−7 and the outer island uses UTC−8 
* Chiapas
* Durango
* Guanajuato
* Guerrero
* Hidalgo
* Jalisco
* Mexico City
* Michoacán
* Morelos
* Nayarit – *only the municipality of Bahía de Banderas, rest of the state uses UTC−7
* Nuevo León
* Oaxaca
* Puebla
* Querétaro
* San Luis Potosí
* State of Mexico
* Tabasco
* Tamaulipas
* Tlaxcala
* Veracruz
* Yucatán
* Zacatecas
=== Central America ===
Out of the seven countries comprising Central America, all but one use Central Standard Time year-round:
*Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.

Panama, which recognizes Eastern Standard Time (UTC−5) year round, is the exception.

==Central Daylight Time==

Daylight saving time (DST) is in effect in much of the Central time zone between mid-March and early November. The modified time is called &quot;Central Daylight Time&quot; (CDT) and is UTC−05:00.

In the United States, all time zones that observe DST were effectively changed by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Beginning in 2007, DST would now begin at 2 a.m. (02:00) on the second Sunday in March instead of the first Sunday in April, moving the time from 2 to 3 a.m. (i.e., from 02:00 to 03:00). Additionally, DST would end at 2 a.m. (02:00) on the first Sunday in November instead of the last Sunday in October, moving the time from 2 to 1 a.m. (i.e., from 02:00 to 01:00).

At the time, Mexico decided not to go along with this change and observed their &quot;horario de verano&quot; (&quot;summer schedule&quot;) from the first Sunday in April to the last Sunday in October. In December 2009, the Mexican Congress allowed ten border cities, eight of which are in states that observe Central Time, to adopt the US daylight time schedule effective in 2010. In October 2022, however, CDT was used in Mexico for the last time after DST was abolished. The US is also seeing traction in the same direction, with the Sunshine Protection Act that proposes legislation that would permanently end the switching of times and make daylight saving time permanent.

<text>Marcus Antistius Labeo (died 10 or 11 AD) was a Roman jurist.

Marcus Antistius Labeo was the son of Pacuvius Labeo, a jurist who caused himself to be slain after the defeat of his party at Philippi. Since his name was different from his father&#x27;s, he was presumably adopted by an otherwise unknown Antistius. A member of plebeian nobility in easy circumstances, young Labeo entered public life early. Marcus Antistius rose quickly to the praetorship; but undisguised antipathy for the new regime and the brusque manner he occasionally gave expression to Republican sympathies in the Senate – what Tacitus calls his &quot;incorrupta libertas&quot; – proved an obstacle to his advancement. His rival, Ateius Capito, a loyal client of new ruling powers, was promoted by Caesar Augustus to the consulate even though Labeo was in line for the job. Smarting under the wrong done him, Labeo declined the office when it was offered to him in a subsequent year.

From this time he seems to have devoted his whole time to jurisprudence. His training in the science had been derived principally from Trebatius Testa. To his knowledge of the law he added a wide general culture, devoting his attention specially to dialectics, philology (grammatica), and antiquities, as valuable aids in the exposition, expansion, and application of legal doctrine. Down to the time of Hadrian his was probably the name of greatest authority; and several of his works were abridged and annotated by later hands.

While Capito is hardly ever referred to, the &quot;dicta&quot; of Labeo are of constant recurrence in the writings of the classical jurists, such as Gaius, Ulpian and Julius Paulus; and no inconsiderable number of them were thought worthy of preservation in Justinian&#x27;s &quot;Digest&quot;. Labeo gets the credit of being the founder of the Proculian school, while Capito is spoken of as the founder of the rival Sabinian one; but it is probable that the real founders of the two &quot;scholae&quot; were Proculus and Masurius Sabinus, followers respectively of the methods of Labeo and Capito.

Labeo&#x27;s most important literary work was the &quot;Libri posteriores&quot;, so called because published only after his death. It contained a systematic exposition of the common law. His &quot;Libri ad Edictum&quot; embraced a commentary, not only on the edicts of the urban and peregrine praetors, but also on that of the curule aediles. His &quot;Probabilium&quot; lib. VIII., a collection of definitions and axiomatic legal propositions, seems to have been one of his most characteristic productions.

<text>Basic Instinct is a 1992 erotic thriller film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas. Starring Michael Douglas, Sharon Stone, George Dzundza, Jeanne Tripplehorn, and Wayne Knight, the film follows the detective Nick Curran (Douglas) as he investigates the murder of a wealthy rock star in San Francisco. He begins an intense relationship with Catherine Tramell (Stone), an enigmatic writer and the prime suspect.

The script was developed by Eszterhas in the 1980s, and it became the subject of a bidding war. Carolco Pictures secured the rights to the film and brought Verhoeven on board to direct. Stone was cast as Tramell after the role was rejected by several actresses. Production was plagued by protests and intense conflict between Eszterhas and Verhoeven.

&quot;Basic Instinct&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on March 18, 1992, and was theatrically released in the United States by TriStar Pictures on March 20, 1992. The film received mixed reviews upon its release, with praise for the performances of the cast, score, and editing, while its writing and character development were criticized. It also generated controversy due to its sexually explicit content, violence, and depiction of homosexual relationships. Despite the public protest, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; was a commercial success, grossing $352.9 million worldwide and becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1992. Due to its success and controversy, it inspired many imitators, and has been labelled as &quot;perhaps the quintessential erotic thriller of the 1990s.&quot;

Since its release, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; has undergone a critical reevaluation. The film has been recognized for its groundbreaking depictions of sexuality in mainstream Hollywood cinema, and was described by one scholar as &quot;a neo-film noir masterpiece that plays with, and transgresses, the narrative rules of film noir.&quot; Numerous versions have been released on home video, including a director&#x27;s cut with extended footage previously unseen in North American cinemas.

A sequel, &quot;Basic Instinct 2&quot;, was released 14 years later in 2006. The film stars Stone, but was made without the involvement of Verhoeven or Douglas. It received negative reviews and was relatively unsuccessful.

== Plot ==

In San Francisco, a blonde woman ties a retired rock star, Johnny Boz, to a bed with a silk scarf during sex, then stabs him to death with an ice pick. Detective Nick Curran and his partner, Gus Moran, investigate the murder. The prime suspect is Boz&#x27;s girlfriend, the crime novelist Catherine Tramell, whose novel mirrors the crime.

Catherine is uncooperative and taunts the investigators by smoking and exposing herself. Although she is released, Nick discovers that she has a history of befriending murderers. This includes Roxy Hardy, Catherine&#x27;s girlfriend, who killed her two younger brothers at the age of 16, and Hazel Dobkins, who killed her husband and children.

Nick, who accidentally shot two tourists while high on cocaine during an undercover assignment, attends counseling sessions with the police psychologist Dr. Beth Garner. The two have an on-and-off affair. Nick discovers that Catherine is using him as the basis for the protagonist of her latest book, in which his character is murdered after falling for the wrong woman. Suspicious that she has bribed lieutenant Marty Nilsen for his psychiatric file, Nick assaults Nilsen in his office. Nilsen is found murdered, and Nick is suspected and placed on leave.

Nick sees Catherine snorting cocaine with Roxy at Boz&#x27;s club. At Catherine&#x27;s home, she ties him to her bed with a silk scarf during sex while Roxy watches. Moran is angry that Nick has begun a relationship with Catherine, and uncovers evidence that Nilsen was paid fifty thousand dollars three months earlier, before Nick and Catherine met.

Jealous of Nick, Roxy tries to run him over with Catherine&#x27;s car but crashes and dies. Upset, Catherine confesses to Nick about a college encounter with a girl that ended badly when the girl became obsessed with her. Nick identifies that girl as Beth, who claims that it was Catherine who was obsessed. When Nick visits Berkeley, he discovers that Catherine&#x27;s report against Beth was withdrawn by Nilsen a year earlier; that a college professor of Catherine and Beth&#x27;s was killed with an ice pick in an unsolved homicide that inspired one of Catherine&#x27;s early novels; and that discovers Nilsen had investigated the unsolved murder of Beth&#x27;s former husband and that Beth&#x27;s lesbian lover may have been involved.

Nick discovers the final pages of Catherine&#x27;s book, in which the detective finds his partner&#x27;s body in an elevator. Catherine ends their affair, leaving Nick upset and suspicious. He meets Moran, who has arranged to meet Catherine&#x27;s college roommate in Oakland to learn about Catherine and Beth. Nick discovers Moran stabbed to death with an ice pick in the elevator, as in the novel. Beth arrives and claims that she received a message to meet Moran. Nick suspects Beth of killing Moran and shoots her when he believes she is reaching for a gun, but finds she is unarmed.

Evidence implicates Beth in the murders of Boz, Nilsen, Moran, and her husband. The investigators find extensive photos and newspaper clippings of Catherine. Nick is confused and dejected. Catherine meets him at his apartment and explains her reluctance to commit to him due to her loved ones dying. They have sex and discuss their future. Unseen by Nick, an ice pick lies underneath the bed.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
The screenplay, which was written in the 1980s, sparked a bidding war until it was finally purchased by Carolco Pictures for US$3 million. Joe Eszterhas, who had previously been the creative force behind several blockbuster films such as &quot;Flashdance&quot; (1983) and &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; (1985), managed to complete the script in just 13 days. However, Paul Verhoeven had suggested changes to the script that Eszterhas strongly disagreed with, including a lesbian sex scene that Eszterhas deemed &quot;exploitative&quot;. With Verhoeven unwilling to budge, Eszterhas and producer Irwin Winkler left the production.

Gary Goldman was subsequently brought on board to rewrite the script four times at Verhoeven&#x27;s suggestion. However, by the fourth draft, Verhoeven himself acknowledged that his proposals were &quot;undramatic&quot; and &quot;really stupid&quot;. By the fifth and final draft, the script had returned to Eszterhas&#x27; original vision, with only minor tweaks to visuals and dialogue. As a result, Joe Eszterhas received sole writing credit for the film. In preparation for the car chase scene, Douglas drove up the steps on Kearny Street in San Francisco for four nights by himself.

The home of Sharon Stone&#x27;s character, prominently featured in the film, is said to be in Stinson Beach, California, just north of San Francisco. In reality, the scenes were shot at a mansion near Carmel-by-the-Sea, about south of San Francisco. The property had been previously owned by the late adventurer Steve Fossett and his wife until her death in 2017. In 2018, the residence was purchased by software engineer Gary Vickers, who combined it into an estate with four adjoining cottages he also owned; he put the entire property on sale the following year for $52.4 million. By 2022, the asking price had been lowered to $29.6 million.

=== Casting ===
After numerous actors turned down the lead role, Carolco worried they would not be able to cast a suitable male lead. CAA&#x27;s agent Ronald Meyer called Carolco and said that he knew the script had been turned down by actors; Meyer said Michael Douglas would agree to star in the film if Carolco could meet his salary requirement, and Carolco quickly agreed. Douglas was cast in the project early on. He recommended Kim Basinger for the role of Catherine Tramell, but she declined. He also suggested Julia Roberts, Greta Scacchi, and Meg Ryan, but they all turned down the role. Debra Winger, Michelle Pfeiffer, Geena Davis, Kathleen Turner, Kelly Lynch, Ellen Barkin, and Mariel Hemingway all turned down the role as well when offered by Verhoeven and producers.

Verhoeven considered Demi Moore, but ultimately chose Sharon Stone, with whom he had previously worked on &quot;Total Recall&quot;. Verhoeven had been particularly struck by the way she quickly transitioned from evil to love in a couple of seconds before her character&#x27;s death in that film. Verhoeven tested with Stone as Douglas first refused to test with her. Verhoeven kept playing her test after testing everyone else, and Douglas later agreed to test with Stone after 12 other actresses turned down the role. Michael Douglas was initially upset that the relatively unknown Stone was cast in the role, determined to have another A-list actress star in the movie with him. Worried about taking the risk on his own, he said, &quot;I need someone to share the risks of this movie. [...] I don&#x27;t want to be up there all by myself. There&#x27;s going to be a lot of shit flying around.&quot; He later remarked that &quot;we had a fabulous actress in Sharon. She was just perfect for the role&quot;.
Stone was paid $500,000 for her role, while Douglas received $14 million.

==Music==
=== Soundtrack ===
The musical score for &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; was composed by Jerry Goldsmith and earned him nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Goldsmith described the process as challenging, stating, &quot;&quot;Basic Instinct&quot; was probably the most difficult [score] I&#x27;ve ever done. It&#x27;s a very convoluted story with very unorthodox characters. It&#x27;s a murder mystery, but it isn&#x27;t really a murder mystery. The director, Paul Verhoeven, had a very clear idea of how the woman should be, and I had a hard time getting it. Because of Paul pushing me, I think it&#x27;s one of the best scores I&#x27;ve ever written. It was a true collaboration.&quot;

In terms of featured music, commercially released tracks played a minor role in the film. The club scene prominently features &quot;Blue&quot; by Chicago house music performer LaTour and &quot;Rave the Rhythm&quot; by the group Channel X, as well as &quot;Movin&#x27; on Up&quot; by Jeff Barry and Ja&#x27;Net DuBois. Chris Rea&#x27;s &quot;Looking for the Summer&quot; is heard during a scene between Douglas and his partner at Mac&#x27;s Diner.

The film&#x27;s official soundtrack was released on March 17, 1992. In 2004, Prometheus Records issued an expanded version of Goldsmith&#x27;s score, which included previously omitted sections and alternative compositions for certain elements.

==Release==
===Theatrical===

The film opened in North American theatres in March 1992, and after being entered into the 1992 Cannes Film Festival continued on to a worldwide release.

=== MPAA rating ===
&quot;Basic Instinct&quot; is rated R for &quot;strong violence and sensuality, and for drug use and language&quot;. Initially, the film was given an NC-17 rating by the MPAA for &quot;graphic depictions of extremely explicit violence, sexual content and strong language&quot;. However, under pressure from TriStar and Carolco, Verhoeven cut 35 to 40 seconds from the film to achieve an R rating. Verhoeven described the changes in a March 1992 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

=== Home media ===
The theatrical release of the film was cut by 35 to 40 seconds to avoid an NC-17 rating, with some violence and sexually explicit content removed. The missing or censored material, later released on video and DVD as the director&#x27;s cut, included:
* The murder of Johnny Boz in the opening scene. In the director&#x27;s cut, the killer is seen stabbing him in his neck, in the chest and through his nose. In addition, the killer is still having violent sex with him while stabbing him at the same time.
* The scene where Nick rapes Beth is cut in the US theatrical version. He is seen ripping off her clothes and forcing her over the couch, before a cut to the two of them lying on the floor. In the uncut version, she verbally tells him to stop and says &#x27;no&#x27; multiple times.
* The scene where Nick and Catherine have sex after going to the club is longer and much more explicit in the uncut version.

In 2021, StudioCanal released a restored 4K Ultra HD &#x27;collector&#x27;s edition&#x27; of the film on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download in the UK (June 14), Australia (July 7), and New Zealand (July 14). The restoration was supervised by the director and completed in 2019–2020, using the original 35MM negative. Additionally, a new documentary titled &quot;Basic Instinct, Sex, Death &amp; Stone&quot; was added as a special feature.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Basic Instinct&quot; opened in theaters in the United States and Canada on March 20, 1992, and became one of the highest-grossing films of that year. It debuted at number one at the US box office, grossing $15 million in its opening weekend. After briefly dropping down the charts, it returned to number one in its fifth week, where it remained for four weeks. In total, the film grossed $117.7 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally, it grossed $352,927,224, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film released in 1992 worldwide. In Italy, it had a record opening of $5.44 million and remained number one for four weeks, ultimately grossing $20 million and becoming the highest-grossing film for the year. It was the highest-grossing film in Spain of all time, with a gross of $21.6 million, and in the United Kingdom, it was number one for three weeks and the highest-grossing film for the year with a gross of £15.5 million. It was also number one for the year in France ($27 million), Germany (4.5 million admissions), South Africa ($3 million), Iceland, and Ireland. In Australia, it was number one for three weeks and the second-highest-grossing film for the year, grossing A$13.1 million.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Basic Instinct&quot;″s critical reaction was mixed. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 56% based on 77 reviews, with an average rating of 6.20/10 and the consensus that &quot;Unevenly echoing the work of Alfred Hitchcock, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; contains a star-making performance from Sharon Stone, but is ultimately undone by its problematic, overly lurid plot.&quot; On Metacritic the film holds a score of 43 based on 28 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film, saying &quot;&quot;Basic Instinct&quot; transfers Mr. Verhoeven&#x27;s flair for action-oriented material to the realm of Hitchcockian intrigue, and the results are viscerally effective even when they don&#x27;t make sense.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also praised the film, saying it was a guilty pleasure film; he also expressed admiration for Verhoeven&#x27;s direction, saying his &quot;cinematic wet dream delivers the goods, especially when Sharon Stone struts on with enough come-on carnality to singe the screen,&quot; and praised Stone&#x27;s performance: &quot;Stone, a former model, is a knockout; she even got a rise out of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Verhoeven&#x27;s &quot;Total Recall&quot;. But being the bright spot in too many dull movies (&quot;He Said, She Said&quot;; &quot;Irreconcilable Differences&quot;) stalled her career. Though &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; establishes Stone as a bombshell for the Nineties, it also shows she can nail a laugh or shade an emotion with equal aplomb.&quot;

Australian critic Shannon J. Harvey of the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; called it one of the &quot;1990s[&#x27;] finest productions, doing more for female empowerment than any feminist rally. Stone—in her star-making performance—is as hot and sexy as she is ice-pick cold.&quot;

The film had many detractors. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded it two out of four stars, saying the film was well crafted but died down in the last half-hour: &quot;The film is like a crossword puzzle. It keeps your interest until you solve it. Then it&#x27;s just a worthless scrap with the spaces filled in.&quot; Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also gave a negative review, calling it psychologically empty: &quot;Verhoeven does not explore the dark side, but merely exploits it, and that makes all the difference in the world.&quot;

=== Controversy ===
==== Initial ====
After the script was made available to gay rights activist groups in early 1991, concerns arose as to the film&#x27;s depiction of homosexual relationships, and the portrayal of a bisexual woman as a murderous psychopath. Activists claimed that the film followed a pattern of negative depictions and stereotypes of homosexuals in film. While Eszterhas was open to addressing these concerns, Verhoeven, Douglas, and producer Alan Marshall rejected the changes, claiming that they &quot;undermined&quot; Eszterhas&#x27; script and &quot;lessen the integrity of the picture.&quot; Upon resuming filming in San Francisco in late April 1991, gay and lesbian rights activists and demonstrators attended, and the San Francisco Police Department&#x27;s riot police were present at every location to manage the crowds. Protesters outside the filming locations held signs that said &quot;Honk if you love the 49ers&quot; and &quot;Honk if you love men.&quot; On April 29, Marshall ordered a citizen&#x27;s arrest and personally identified each protester he wanted arrested. However, this did not result in any action by the local police department.

Members of the lesbian and bisexual activist group LABIA protested against the film on its opening night. Others also picketed theatres to dissuade people from attending screenings, carrying signs saying &quot;Kiss My Ice Pick&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Promotes Anti-Gay Violence&quot; and &quot;Catherine Did It!&quot;/&quot;Save Your Money—The Bisexual Did It&quot;. Verhoeven himself defended the groups&#x27; right to protest, but criticized the disruptions they caused, saying &quot;Fascism is not in raising your voice; the fascism is in not accepting the no.&quot;

Six protestors disrupted the filming of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on April 11, 1992, while Stone was hosting. The protestors attempted to rush the stage, but they were apprehended by security; two women and four men were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and harassment. The live version of Stone&#x27;s interrupted monologue was replaced in repeat broadcasts with footage from the dress rehearsal.

Film critic Roger Ebert mentioned the controversy in his review, saying &quot;As for the allegedly offensive homosexual characters: The movie&#x27;s protesters might take note of the fact that this film&#x27;s heterosexuals, starting with Douglas, are equally offensive. Still, there is a point to be made about Hollywood&#x27;s unremitting insistence on typecasting homosexuals—particularly lesbians—as twisted and evil.&quot; Camille Paglia denounced the gay activist and feminist protests against &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, and called Sharon Stone&#x27;s performance &quot;one of the great performances by a woman in screen history&quot;, praising her character as &quot;a great vamp figure, like Mona Lisa herself, like a pagan goddess.&quot;

Women&#x27;s rights groups also protested the film over its negative depiction of women and a brutal rape scene, with a branch of The National Organization for Women calling the film &quot;the most blatantly misogynistic film in recent memory.&quot; Its Los Angeles branch president at the time claimed the movie sent a message &quot;that women like violence, women like to be used, women like to be raped.&quot; The film was also criticized for glamorizing cigarette smoking. Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas was later diagnosed with throat cancer and publicly apologized for glamorizing smoking in his films.

In 1992, in Les Herbiers, France, the mayor Jeanne Briand banned the movie in her municipality, claiming that this movie was &quot;apologism for crime and violence, which exacerbates impulses that can lead to rape.&quot;

==== Renewed ====
Stone has alleged multiple times that a scene in which her vulva was exposed as she crossed her legs was filmed without her knowledge. She said she was told that her lack of underwear would only be alluded to and not shown. She had been wearing white underwear until Verhoeven said it reflected light on the camera lens and asked her to remove it, assuring her that only a shadow would be visible. She said it was not until she saw the film in a screening room with a test audience that she became aware of the visible nudity, leading her to slap Verhoeven in the face and leave the screening.

In her 2021 memoir, Stone again stated that she was misled by Verhoeven with regard to the circumstance of the filming of the scene, even though she ultimately did not seek an injunction against it. Verhoeven responded that it was &quot;impossible&quot; and &quot;she knew exactly what we were doing.&quot; However, despite having a &quot;radically different&quot; memory about the particular scene, he praised Stone&#x27;s performance and said they are on good terms. In a 1998 &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; interview, Stone said that while she was initially angry, she realized Verhoeven&#x27;s decision was the right one, saying, &quot;And I thought about it for a few days and I knew in my heart, he was right. I hated that it existed, I hated it more that he stole it from me instead of allowing me to choose. But he was right.&quot;

In a 1993 &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; interview, Jeanne Tripplehorn stated that the notorious &quot;brutal, bruising sex&quot; between her and Douglas&#x27;s character was somewhat &quot;lighter&quot; when described to her by Verhoeven before shooting. During the trial for Luka Magnotta for the murder of Jun Lin, the prosecution stated that Luka Magnotta stabbed Lin to death with a screwdriver painted silver in order to resemble the ice pick used by Stone&#x27;s character, Catherine Tramell.
